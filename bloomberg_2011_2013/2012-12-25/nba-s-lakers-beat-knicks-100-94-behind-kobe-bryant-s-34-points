Kobe Bryant  scored 34 points as the
 Los Angeles  Lakers beat the New York Knicks 100-94 yesterday for
the National Basketball Association team’s season-best fifth
consecutive win.  Steve Nash  added 16 points and 11 assists for the Lakers,
who improved to 14-14 for the season, including 9-9 under coach
 Mike D’Antoni . The 38-year-old point guard and two-time NBA Most
Valuable Player took part in his second straight game since
returning to the Lakers Dec. 23 after missing 24 games with a
left leg injury.  “It makes it very easy for me,” Bryant said of Nash’s
return in a televised interview from the Staples Center in Los
Angeles. “I just have to run the lane, look for opportunities
to score.”  Carmelo Anthony  finished with 34 points, including 17 in
the third quarter, to lead the Knicks, which lost for the second
time in three games. J.R. Smith added 25 points for New York.  Bryant scored eight of the Lakers’ first 10 fourth-quarter
points and Los Angeles never trailed after the NBA’s leading
scorer made a basket with 7:37 remaining. The Lakers held
Anthony to seven points in the final quarter and Smith missed a
three-point shot with 32.9 seconds remaining that would have
tied the game at 97.  Pau Gasol’s driving dunk with 12 seconds remaining sealed
the win for the Lakers. Gasol finished with 13 points, 8
rebounds and 6 assists. Metta World Peace added 20 points for
the Lakers before fouling out with 1:58 remaining.  Dwight Howard 
had 14 points and 12 rebounds.  The Knicks dropped to 20-8 with the defeat, remaining in
first place in the Atlantic Division. New York plays against the
Phoenix Suns today.  Miami Heat  LeBron James scored 29 points as the Miami Heat beat the
Oklahoma City Thunder 103-97 in a rematch of last season’s NBA
Finals.  James had nine assists and eight rebounds for the defending
champions, who improved to 19-6. Dwyane Wade added 21 points at
Miami’s American Airlines Arena.  Kevin Durant  scored 33 points and  Russell Westbrook  put up
21 for the Thunder. Both missed potential game-tying three
pointers in the game’s final seconds.  At the Barclays Center in New York, Rajon Rondo scored 19
points and added five assists to help the Boston Celtics beat
the Brooklyn Nets 93-76. Brook Lopez and  Gerald Wallace  each
scored 15 points for the Nets, which lost four of the past five
games.  In Chicago, the Houston Rockets beat the Bulls 120-97. The
Clippers beat the Denver Nuggets 112-100 in Los Angeles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
