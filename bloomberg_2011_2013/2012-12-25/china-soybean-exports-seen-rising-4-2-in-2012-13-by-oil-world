(Corrects headline to imports in story published Dec. 25.)  China ’s soybean imports are forecast
to climb 4.2 percent in the year through September, with U.S.
exports to the country little changed from the previous year,
researcher Oil World said.  China may purchase 61.7 million metric tons of the oilseed
in 2012-13 from 59.2 million tons a year earlier, the Hamburg-
based researcher wrote in an e-mailed report.  The country, the world’s biggest buyer of the commodity,
canceled 840,000 tons of purchases from the U.S. last week,
prompting futures of the oilseed traded in  Chicago  to slide 4.2
percent in the period.  “China cancels U.S. soybeans but still strongly depends on
U.S. exports until March,” Oil World wrote. “It can indeed be
argued that China cannot cover its import requirements if the
canceled orders are not at least replaced or even supplemented
with additional purchases.”  The U.S. may ship 23 million tons of soybeans to China in
2012-13, similar to the 23.1 million tons sold the previous year,
according to Oil World.  China is predicted to import 19.8 million tons of soybeans
from the U.S. in the six months through March compared with 16.6
million tons in the year-earlier October to March period as late
planting delays harvests in  South America , Oil World said.  Shipments from  Brazil  to China in the same period are
predicted to fall to 2.2 million tons from 6.7 million tons,
while those from Argentina are seen dropping to 1.7 million tons
from 4.3 million tons, according to the researcher.  Soybean Exports  In the April-to-September period, soybean exports to China
from the U.S. are predicted to drop to 3.2 million tons from 6.4
million tons, Oil world wrote.  Soybean sales from Argentina may climb to 8.4 million tons
from 3.6 million tons in the six months through September and
Brazil’s soybean exports to China will rise to 22.6 million tons
from 19.8 million tons, based on Oil World’s outlook.  “It would be risky for Chinese buyers to fully rely on
these quantities, given the still manifold uncertainties
regarding the crop sizes, particularly in the flooded Argentine
areas,” the researcher said.  Rainfall in parts of  Argentina  in the first three weeks of
December was three to four times normal, causing additional
flooding and damaging winter wheat as well as recently planted
summer crops, including corn and soybeans, Oil World wrote.  “More and more local observers warn that soybean
production could turn out at or below 50 million tons in early
2013,” Oil World wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
