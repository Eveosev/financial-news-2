Algeria expects a slight decline in
oil and natural gas produced by foreign firms in the north
African nation as a result of an output decline in some fields,
the chief executive officer of state-run Sonatrach said.  Abdelhamid Zerguine also said the economic crisis in  Europe 
is prompting the company’s clients to seek discounts “because
they can’t sell the gas and generate their profit margin,”
according to the state-run APS news agency. He said the company
was not under pressure to revise the price of gas delivered
under long-term contracts.  Sonatrach expects to produce 200 million tons of oil
equivalent this year, compared with 206 million toe in 2011,
Zerguine said.  The El Merk oil field will be commissioned in the coming
months, he said. The project is jointly operated by Sonatrach
and its partners, Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Eni SpA, Talisman
Energy Inc. and ConocoPhhillips, and is expected to have an
output capacity of 100,000 barrels a day.  He said new fields will also go into production in the
Berkine Basin’s Menzel Ledjmet East project, APS reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
