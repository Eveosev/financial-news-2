China ’s money-market rate dropped
the most in two weeks on speculation the supply of cash will
improve as the central bank adds more funds to the financial
system. The  yuan  was little changed against the dollar.  The People’s Bank of China conducted 110 billion yuan
($17.6 billion) of 28-day reverse repurchase contract  operations 
today, the most since Nov. 6, according to a statement on its
website. The  yield  on the securities was 3.6 percent, unchanged
from the previous sale.  “As long as the central bank keeps injecting capital
through reverse repos, there won’t be a year-end cash crunch,”
said Wang Huane, a senior trader at Qilu Bank Co. in Jinan,
capital of the eastern province of Shandong.  The 14-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, tumbled 49 basis points to 4.12 percent as
of 10:25 a.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest drop since Dec. 7,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose two basis
points to 3.36 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bond due August
2017 dropped one basis point to 3.26 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  China’s yuan traded at 6.2345 per dollar, from 6.2335
yesterday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The central bank weakened the  reference rate  by 0.03 percent to
6.2931, the lowest since Nov. 19.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.09 percent to
6.3325, a 1.5 percent discount to the onshore spot rate. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at 1.8
percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
