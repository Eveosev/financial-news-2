San Francisco 49ers wide receiver
 Mario Manningham  will miss the team’s final regular-season game
and the National Football League playoffs after tearing two
ligaments in his left knee, ESPN reported.   Manningham tore the anterior cruciate and posterior
cruciate ligaments during the third quarter of the 49ers’ 42-13
loss in Seattle two days ago, ESPN reported, without saying
where it got the information.    Manningham’s injury leaves the 49ers without their third-
leading receiver as they try to win a division title and prepare
for the postseason. San Francisco (10-4-1) has already qualified
for the playoffs and can clinch the National Football
Conference’s West division title with a home win on Dec. 30
against the  Arizona  Cardinals.   Manningham, in his first season in San Francisco after four
years with the  New York  Giants, had 42 receptions for 449 yards
and one touchdown.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
