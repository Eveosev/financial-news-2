Southern Methodist University 
defeated Fresno State 43-10 in the Hawaii Bowl, the Mustangs’
second straight postseason victory under coach June Jones.  SMU quarterback Garrett Gilbert threw a touchdown pass and
also ran for a score last night at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu.
The Mustangs (7-6) scored 22 straight points during the second
quarter to open a 22-0 halftime lead.  SMU later added two fourth-quarter touchdowns on
interceptions of Fresno State quarterback Derek Carr, with
Taylor Reed scoring on a 69-yard return and Hayden Greenbauer
returning another pickoff 83 yards for a score. SMU entered the
game with six interceptions returned for touchdowns, tied for
the most at college football’s top level.  Carr had 362 passing yards and a touchdown for Fresno
State, which finishes the season with a 9-4 record. Carr is the
younger brother of former Fresno State quarterback  David Carr ,
who was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2002 National Football
League draft. The Bulldogs have now lost four straight bowl
games and five of their past six.  To contact the reporter on this story:
