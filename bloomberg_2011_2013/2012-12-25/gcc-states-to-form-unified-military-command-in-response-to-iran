The Gulf Cooperation Council said it
will form a unified military command structure at a time when
Iran poses a “very serious” security threat to the  Middle
East .  The six-member group will coordinate air, land, and marine
forces under one structure, Bahrain’s Foreign Minister Sheikh
Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa said today in a press conference
after a meeting of GCC heads of state in Manama, the Bahraini
capital.  Iran’s nuclear program  is a security threat to the
region, he said.  The GCC has accused Shiite-led Iran of intervening in the
internal affairs of Arab countries in the Persian Gulf, home to
three-fifths of the world’s oil reserves.  Saudi Arabia  in
November submitted a letter to the  United Nations  stating that
Iranian aircraft strayed into the kingdom’s territorial waters
near oil and gas fields, Okaz newspaper said, citing Abdallah
al-Mouallimi, the Saudi ambassador to the UN.  “We have several commands at the moment in different
countries,” Sheikh Khalid said. “We want to create a central
command that coordinates between all sub-commands and makes them
work under one umbrella.” The new structure won’t replace the
Peninsula Shield forces, he said.  The GCC sent in March last year the Peninsula Shield to
Bahrain to help crush a Shiite Muslim revolt against its Sunni
rulers. Iran has denied allegations of interference and accused
Sunni rulers in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia of discriminating
against Shiites.  Iran’s naval forces will conduct military exercises this
week in and near the  Strait of Hormuz , the state-run Fars news
agency said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
