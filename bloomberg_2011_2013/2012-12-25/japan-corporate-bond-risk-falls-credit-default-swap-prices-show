The cost of insuring corporate bonds
from non-payment in  Japan  dropped, according to credit-default
swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased one basis point to
159 basis points as of 9:41 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The measure declined to 157.4 basis points on Dec.
19, the least since April, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Markets are closed today in Australia, Hong Kong and
Singapore for holidays.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
