California-blend gasoline in Los
Angeles rose after  BP Plc (BP/)  said it would flare gases at its
Carson refinery through March 26, signaling the start of work on
units at the plant.  BP will shut a coker, a crude unit and an alkylation unit
at the Carson refinery for routine work, two people familiar
with the plans said in interviews on Jan. 3. The maintenance is
expected to last as long as four weeks, one person said.  Carbob in  Los Angeles (MOGLDB85)  gained 0.5 cent to a premium of 16
cents a gallon against gasoline futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The same fuel in  San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  increased 0.5 cent to a 13-cent
premium against futures.  The 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery supplies a fifth
of  Southern California ’s gasoline and half of  Los Angeles 
International Airport’s jet fuel, according to London-based BP’s
website.  Jet fuel  in Los Angeles rose 0.38 cent to a premium of
15.13 cents against Nymex heating oil futures.  California-blend diesel, or CARB diesel, in  Los Angeles (DIEILCAD) 
slipped 0.75 cent to an 18.75-cent premium against Nymex heating
oil futures. The same fuel in  San Francisco (DIEISCAD)  strengthened 0.25
cent to a premium of 15.5 cents versus heating oil futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon , was
unchanged at a discount of 2 cents a gallon against gasoline
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
