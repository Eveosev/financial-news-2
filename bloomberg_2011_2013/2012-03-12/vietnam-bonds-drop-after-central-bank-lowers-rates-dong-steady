Vietnam’s bonds dropped after the
central bank said it will cut benchmark  interest rates  from
tomorrow to support economic growth. The dong was unchanged.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam will lower the refinancing rate
to 14 percent from 15 percent, according to a statement on its
website today. It’s the first reduction since 2009. The central
bank will also cut its discount rate to 12 percent from 13
percent and the dong deposit cap for terms of one-month and more
to 13 percent from 14 percent, it said.  The  yield  on the government’s two-year notes climbed seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 11.54 percent,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  “Traders had already anticipated this move and priced the
rate reduction into bond yields,” said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-
based bond trader at Bank for Investment & Development of
 Vietnam .  The dong traded at 20,830 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
set the daily  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26,
its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1
percent on either side of the rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen in Hanoi. Editor: Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
