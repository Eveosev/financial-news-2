Asian currencies added to last
week’s losses after reports over the weekend signaled  China’s
economy  slowed last month, damping the demand outlook for the
region’s exports.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar  Index (ADXY)  snapped a three-
day advance after  China  said on March 10 that its trade deficit
in February was the widest in at least 22 years. Overseas sales
from Asia’s largest economy rose 18.4 percent, less than the 31
percent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Demand for the dollar improved after the U.S. Labor Department
said March 9 that nonfarm payrolls increased 227,000 in February,
following a revised 284,000 jump the previous month.  “We’ve seen weaker data in Asia led by China,” said
 Thomas Harr , head of Asian currency strategy at Standard
Chartered Plc in Singapore. “It’s weighing on the  currency
markets .”  Malaysia’s ringgit declined 0.8 percent to 3.0330 per
dollar as of 4:34 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. South Korea’s won fell 0.5 percent to
1,123.90, Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.5 percent to 9,170 and
China’s yuan slipped 0.25 percent to 6.3265.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of  stocks  snapped a two-day
gain and fell 0.5 percent. China said on March 10 its trade
shortfall in February was $31.4 billion.  The yuan dropped by the most since Jan. 20 after the
People’s Bank of China weakened its  daily reference rate  by 0.33
percent to 6.3282 per dollar, the biggest decline since August
2010.  Malaysian Output Slowing  The better-than-expected U.S. jobs data damped speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will further ease monetary policy to spur
the world’s biggest economy. Commerce Department figures
tomorrow may show U.S. retail sales increased 1.1 percent in
February, the most in five months, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “The dollar strengthened as the report pared market
expectations of another round of quantitative easing,”
according to a research note from Kuala Lumpur-based Hong Leong
Bank Bhd. today.  The ringgit fell the most in three weeks after a government
report showed industrial production grew 0.2 percent in January
from a year earlier, the least in six months. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a 0.9 percent gain, following a
revised 2.9 percent increase in December.  Thailand’s baht dropped 0.2 percent to 30.66 per dollar
before a government report today that may show exports failed to
grow in January, after shrinking 2 percent in December,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Thai exports will be quite bumpy,” said  Vishnu Varathan ,
an economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Singapore .
“China’s data has renewed concerns and the bigger picture
globally remains pretty soft.”  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s  dollar  depreciated 0.2 percent to
NT$29.554 against its U.S. counterpart. The Philippine peso
dropped 0.2 percent to 42.658 and the  Indian rupee  declined 0.2
percent to 49.9756. Vietnam’s dong was steady at 20,830.  To contact the reporters on this story:
