Salfacorp SA (SALFACOR) ,  Chile ’s largest
engineering and construction company, led losses among members
of the benchmark Ipsa index after reporting a 28 percent decline
in annual profit.  Salfacorp fell 2.5 percent to 1,364.9 pesos at 1:37 p.m. in
Santiago. It earlier retreated 3.2 percent, the most on an
intraday basis in 13 weeks. The Ipsa was little changed.  Salfacorp SA reported that 2011 annual net income dropped
to 15.9 billion pesos ($33 million), from 22.1 billion pesos in
2010, according to a statement posted March 10 on the website of
Chile’s securities regulator.  “Salfacorp is falling after posting weak results,”
Santiago-based brokerage FIT Research wrote in a note to clients
today.  On a quarterly basis, profit fell 56 percent to 5.31
billion pesos from 12 billion pesos a year earlier.  “Market conditions in the last quarter affected the
company’s margins, despite a considerable expansion in
revenue,” Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA wrote in a note to
clients. “In the mid-term we expect conditions to improve.”  Salfacorp’s 2011 revenue rose 27 percent to 901 billion
pesos. Euroamerica attributed the gain to the consolidation of
recent acquisitions, such as Chilean builder Empresas Tecsa SA,
engineering services company ICEM SA and Panamanian builder
Intercoastal Marine Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
