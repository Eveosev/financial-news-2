Asian  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index headed for its first loss in three days, as
Chinese exports grew at a slower pace than economists forecast,
overshadowing a rebound in  Japan ’s machinery orders and better-
than-expected U.S. jobs data.  Li & Fung Ltd., which exports toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., fell 1.5 percent in  Hong Kong .  Samsung Electronics
Co. (005930)  slid 1.6 percent in Seoul after Apple Inc. claimed the
smartphone maker violated a court order in a patent-infringement
case. Train and rail builders plunged in Hong Kong after a
report a high-speed track collapsed on the mainland.  “ China ’s government needs to do something to beef up the
economy,” said  Alex Au , Hong Kong-based managing director of
Richland Capital Management Ltd., which oversees $300 million.
“The worry about a global economic slowdown is not as bad as
before, as data from the U.S. is showing signs of improvement.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.6 percent to 126.19 as
of 7:46 p.m. in  Tokyo , with almost twice as many stocks falling
as climbing. All but one of 10 industry groups in the measure
dropped.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slid 0.4 percent as the
yen strengthened from a 10-month low against the dollar, damping
the earnings outlook for exporters. The gauge earlier rose as
much as 0.9 percent after a report showed the nation’s machinery
orders rebounded in January, signaling company investment may
help drive a return to growth.  Rail Collapse  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.2 percent. The Shanghai
Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China’s stock
exchanges, slid 0.2 percent.  China posted its largest trade deficit since at least 1989
last month as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt turmoil damped exports and
imports rebounded after the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.
The shortfall was $31.5 billion, the customs bureau said on
March 10.  Li & Fung dropped 1.5 percent to HK$17.50.  China Merchants
Holdings International Co. (144) , which operates ports in China and
abroad, retreated 0.9 percent to HK$26.55. Foxconn International
Holdings Ltd., a contract maker of mobile telephones, slipped
3.6 percent to HK$5.59.  China’s retail sales rose 14.7 percent in January and
February from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics
said on March 9, missing the median estimate for a 17.6 percent
gain in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Australia, Korea  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.4 percent, while
South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.8 percent.  Samsung Electronics declined 1.6 percent to 1.21 million
won in Seoul, the  biggest drag  on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.
Samsung “only partially complied with” a court order requiring
the company to produce source code for products, according to a
filing in the Federal Court in San Jose,  California .  Samsung, the world’s largest maker of mobile phones, and
Apple have filed at least 30 suits on four continents against
each other since April.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed after falling as much as 0.4 percent today. The gauge
rose 0.4 percent in  New York  on March 9 after a 227,000-worker
increase in payrolls last month topped the median projection of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The jobless rate held at
8.3 percent.  James Hardie  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , an Australian supplier of
building materials that gets more than half of sales from the
U.S., climbed 0.3 percent to A$7.53 in Sydney.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 11 percent this year
through last week as the  U.S. economy  showed signs of recovery
and China began to ease its monetary policy. The gain compares
with a 9 percent advance by the  S&P 500  and an 8.6 percent
increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.8 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500 and 11 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Two of the four  steepest drops  in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index were railway-related shares. China Railway Construction
Corp., a builder of the nation’s rail system, slumped 7.3
percent to HK$5.31 in Hong Kong, while  China Railway Group Ltd. (601390) 
fell 5.4 percent to HK$2.83. CSR Corp., the mainland’s biggest
train maker, dropped 4.1 percent to HK$5.42.  A 300-meter (1,000-foot) section of an unopened high-speed
railway collapsed in central China’s Hubei province following
heavy rain, Xinhua News said, citing local authorities. Hundreds
of workers have been sent to make repairs following the March 9
failure in Qianjiang city, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
