Turkiye Petrolleri AO,  Turkey ’s
state oil and gas company, plans to sell a 50 percent stake in
three Mediterranean Sea oil fields that will require as much as
$3 billion of investment in the next five years.  “We’ve had 10 companies show interest and seven of them
have already visited the data room,” Mehmet Uysal, chief
executive officer of the company known as TPAO, said today in an
interview in Kuwait. “Some of the fields look very promising.”  Turkiye Petrolleri, seeking to raise cash to explore and
develop the Mersin Bay, Antalya and Iskenderun blocks in the
eastern Mediterranean, may start accepting bids by May and sign
deals by the end of the year.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,
 Statoil ASA (STL)  and Petroleo Brasileiro SA are among producers that
have shown an interest in investing, the CEO said.  The Turkish company produces about 70,000 barrels a day of
crude, equivalent to about 10 percent of domestic needs. It aims
to become free of imports by 2023. The winning companies may
have to pay for its share of investments, Uysal said.  “It’ll take about five to seven years to produce from
these fields,” Uysal said. “The thing now is to discover the
oil.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
