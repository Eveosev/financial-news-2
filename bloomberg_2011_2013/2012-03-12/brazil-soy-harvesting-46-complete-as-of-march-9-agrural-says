Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer after the U.S., harvested 46
percent of the current crop as of March 9, up from 31 percent a
year earlier, researcher AgRural Commodities Agricolas said.  AgRural, based in Curitiba, Brazil, maintained its forecast
for the country’s soybean output in the crop year that started
Sept. 1 at 68 million metric tons, according to an e-mailed
report.  Output will be less than 75.3 million tons reaped in the
previous harvest and 73.1 million tons estimated initially for
the current crop before a drought parched fields in southern
Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
