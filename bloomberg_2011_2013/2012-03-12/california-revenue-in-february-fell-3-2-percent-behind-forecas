California (STOCA1)  tax revenue trailed
forecasts in February for the third consecutive month, coming in
$146.3 million or 3.2 percent below projections in Governor
 Jerry Brown ’s budget, the state controller’s office said.  Controller John Chiang, in a press release, attributed much
of the shortfall to a “large increase” in early tax refunds
issued in February.  Monthly revenues in the most-populous state have trailed
Brown administration projections since November, according to
updates from Chiang’s office. The controller said state
officials have developed short-term measures such as internal
and external borrowing to prevent  California  from running out of
cash in March.  “While revenues continue to track below projections, the
cash conservation measures that were quickly and decisively
adopted last month will ensure that the state will be able to
pay its bills for the remainder of this fiscal year,” Chiang
said in the press release.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
