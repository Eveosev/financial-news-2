The Depository Trust & Clearing
Corp. received approval from the Securities and Exchange
Commission to operate a clearinghouse for trading of U.S.
mortgage bonds.  The mortgage-backed securities division of DTCC’s Fixed
Income Clearing Corp. will begin acting as a so-called central
counterparty in April, the New York-based company said today in
a statement distributed by  Business Wire . As a CCP, the unit
will guarantee settlement of matched mortgage-bond trades if one
of the parties to the agreement defaults on its commitment.  The initiative is designed to curb risk and costs in the
market for government-backed U.S. mortgage bonds, where trading
totals about $100 trillion a year, the DTCC said.  “This is the first CCP to be created in U.S. cash markets
in more than a quarter of a century,” Donald F. Donahue, the
DTCC’s president and chief executive officer, said in the
statement. “We expect it will greatly reduce risk” by offering
so-called “pool netting services and streamlining the
settlement of mortgage-backed securities trades.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
