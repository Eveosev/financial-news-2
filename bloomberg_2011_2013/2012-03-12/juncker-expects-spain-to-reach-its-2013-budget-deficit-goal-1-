Spain  will reach its goal of
getting its  budget deficit  within the European Union’s limit
next year, said Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
who also heads the group of euro-area finance chiefs.  Finance ministers meeting in Brussels today and tomorrow
won’t take any decision on Spain’s new proposed 2012 deficit
target of 5.8 percent of gross domestic product, Juncker told
reporters. Spain aims to reduce its deficit to the EU limit of 3
percent of GDP in 2013. Juncker also said he doesn’t see a link
between Spain’s economic situation and that of  Greece .  “We assume that Spain will and wants to meet its budget
target for 2013,” he said. “We’ll talk about the concrete
measures that have to be taken” with a view to the 2012 budget.  Asked about progress on lending capacity for the region’s
permanent rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, Juncker
said ministers “will discuss the broad subject today but no
decision will be taken.”  “I will propose that a decision will be taken on the
occasion of the euro group meeting at the end of the month in
Copenhagen,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
