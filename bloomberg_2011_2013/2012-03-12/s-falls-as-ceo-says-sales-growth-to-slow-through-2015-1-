OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT)  slipped to a
two-week low in U.S. trading as the company said revenue growth
will slow over the next four years.  American depositary receipts of Russia’s biggest mobile
operator, known as MTS, retreated 1.8 percent to $17.74 in  New
York , the lowest level since Feb. 22, based on closing prices.
The stock earlier declined as much as 2.5 percent to $17.61.  The Moscow-based company expects revenue to probably climb
5 percent to 7 percent through 2015, after gaining 9 percent
last year to $12.3 billion, Chief Executive Officer  Andrei
Dubovskov  said today. Fourth-quarter revenue slid to $2.98
billion from $3 billion a year earlier, Dubovskov said.  “Investors may see the annual revenue growth forecast as
conservative and think that this is not positive news,” Victor Klimovich, an analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow who recommends
buying the stock, said by phone. “MTS wants to be on the safe
side in its forecast. They cautiously look ahead, in case the
competition increases.”  MTS (MTSS)  was little changed at 227 rubles, or the equivalent of
$7.67, on  Russia ’s ruble-denominated Micex Index. One ADR is
equal to two ordinary shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
