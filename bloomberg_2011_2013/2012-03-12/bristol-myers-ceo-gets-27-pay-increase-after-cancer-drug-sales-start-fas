Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  Chief
Executive Officer Lamberto Andreotti received a 27 percent
increase in total compensation after a new skin cancer drug
gained approval and contributed to higher sales and profits.  Andreotti’s total compensation rose to $14.9 million in
2011 from $11.8 million a year earlier, according to a
regulatory filing. The pay included a bonus of $4.2 million
related to the company’s financial results, share price increase
and the start of sales for the melanoma drug Yervoy, according
to the filing. Andreotti also received an 11 percent base salary
increase to $1.5 million effective April 1, 2011, “to bring him
closer to competitive market levels,” the company said in the
filing.  The higher pay for Andreotti reflected, among other things,
his leadership in “delivering the strong 2011 financial
results” such as annual earnings per share of $2.28 that
exceeded a target of $2.14 a share and “executing the Yervoy
launch,” the company said in the March 9 filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Bristol-Myers loses patent exclusivity on its  best-selling 
drug Plavix later this year. It is counting on new drugs such as
Yervoy to replace the expected reduction in revenue. The
melanoma treatment was approved in March 2011 and generated $360
million in  sales  last year. Bristol-Myers in January agreed to
purchase Inhibitex Inc. for $2.5 billion to gain its hepatitis C
drug as part of its “string of pearls” strategy to develop new
products through acquisitions.  The New York-based drugmaker also ended a one-year salary
freeze for all employees in 2011, the company said in the
filing.  Bristol-Myers rose less than 1 percent to $33.05 in  New
York . The company’s shares, which gained 33 percent in 2011,
have declined 6.2 percent this year.  Jennifer Mauer , a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman, had no comment
beyond the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
