Natural gas spot trading volumes
for  Germany  on the European Energy Exchange AG reached a monthly
record in February, the bourse said.  Volumes in the German Gaspool market area totaled 1.51
million megawatt-hours, a 66 percent increase from the previous
peak reached in December, the exchange said today in an e-mailed
statement.  EEX offers volume-based bonuses to companies when certain
volume thresholds are reached in day-ahead trading on the gas
spot market, the bourse said. The bonus program was started in
February and will run until July.  The Leipzig, Germany-based exchange was formed in 2002 by
the merger of two regional exchanges. Utilities, energy
companies, banks and  hedge funds  trade electricity, natural gas,
coal and carbon-emission contracts on the platform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
