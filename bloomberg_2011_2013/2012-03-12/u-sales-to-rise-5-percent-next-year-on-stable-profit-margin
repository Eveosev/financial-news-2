MTU Aero Engines Holding AG (MTX) , a
German aircraft-engine maker, today said sales  will rise  by
about 5 percent next year, while profitability will remain
unchanged from this year.  Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes will amount to
between 11 percent and 12 percent of sales in 2013, MTU said in
its  annual report  published today, the same level it expects for
this year. The Munich-based company earned an adjusted Ebit of
328 million euros ($431 million) last year for a margin of 11.2
percent.  The company in the report reiterated sales will rise in the
“mid single-digit range´´ this year, with adjusted Ebit rising
by between 8 percent and 10 percent. MTU had sales of 2.93
billion euros last year, and plans to more than double that to 6
billion euros by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
