Crude oil options volatility fell
for a fourth consecutive session as underlying futures declined
after a report showing  China ’s growth slowed the first two
months of this year.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, sank to 27 percent as of 2 p.m., down from
27.8 percent on March 9.  “Volatility is way down across the board,” said  James
Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa,
 Florida . “Oil is down today but it has been stabilizing, and
when you take the large swings out of the market, that’s saps
some of the volatility.”  Crude for April delivery fell $1.14, or 1.1 percent, to
$106.26 a barrel at 2:05 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
