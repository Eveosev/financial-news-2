Samuel Pearson “Terry” Goddard, a
former  Arizona  attorney general and the Democratic nominee for
governor of Arizona in 2010, joined the international law firm
 SNR Denton US LLP (1159L) .  Goddard, 65, served as the state’s attorney general from
2003 to 2011, leading prosecutions for border smuggling,
mortgage fraud and consumer protection, SNR Denton said in a
statement. He lost the 2010 gubernatorial election to Republican
incumbent Jan Brewer. Goddard has been a white-collar criminal
prosecutor and was mayor of Phoenix from 1983 to 1990.  He will join SNR Denton’s Phoenix office as senior counsel
in its state attorneys general practice, which advises clients
on “the challenges of litigation where law, policy and politics
converge,” the firm said in the statement.  Goddard, along with Ira William McCollum and Jeff Modisett,
ex-attorneys general of Florida and  Indiana , respectively, is
the third former top state legal official to join SNR Denton in
the past year.  “The expansion of our state attorneys general practice has
been a priority for the firm, and Terry’s record of
accomplishment in Arizona will offer significant added depth,”
McCollum said in the statement.  SNR Denton, with headquarters in Washington and  London , has
more than 60 offices worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
