Kenya ’s port of Mombasa, East
Africa’s busiest, said throughput rose 5.4 percent last year as
a result of an improved performance by the region’s economies.  The port processed a total of 19.95 million metric tons of
cargo, comprising 771,000 so-called twenty-foot-equivalent units
or TEUs, up from 695,000 TEUs a year earlier, Managing Director
Gichiri Ndua told reporters today in the port city.  Imports rose to 16.94 million tons from 16.20 million tons,
while exports grew 9 percent to 2.79 million tons. Transshipment
traffic surged 44 percent to 227,000 tons.  “The port is designed to handle of 600,000 TEUs a year,
yet we are now handling nearly 800,000 TEUs,” Ndua said.  The building of another berth will add 240 meters (787
feet) of quay to the existing terminal and increase stacking
capacity by 160,000 TEUs annually, Ndua said. The berth is
expected to operational in 2013.  Construction of the second container terminal, which will
have a capacity of 1.2 million TEUs a year, will start soon, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
