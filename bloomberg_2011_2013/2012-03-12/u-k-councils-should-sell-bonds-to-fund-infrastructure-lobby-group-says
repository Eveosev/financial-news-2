Local councils in England and  Wales 
should be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds for
infrastructure projects, according to the  Local Government
Association .  The LGA said in an e-mailed statement today that it has
written to Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  outlining
plans for bond sales to help build bridges, homes and roads.
U.K. councils have higher debt ratings than some European
countries and a top-rated municipal  bond market  would be
attractive to private investors, said the LGA, which represents
more than 350 councils.  “Government has taken some steps towards giving councils
the tools they need to get local economies growing,” Merrick Cockell, the LGA chairman, said in the statement. “But the cuts
to local authority budgets mean it is now more important than
ever for the Treasury to give councils the financial autonomy
they need to create jobs and bring growth to the economy.”  Osborne is seeking to bring down a  budget deficit  that
equals 9 percent of gross domestic product by 2017 through a
raft of austerity measures. The government, which has cut grants
to council infrastructure budgets by almost 50 percent, should
remove borrowing restrictions on councils, the LGA said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
