UnionBanCal Corp. (UB) , a San Francisco-
based bank with $89.7 billion in assets, agreed to acquire
Pacific Capital Bancorp for $1.5 billion to expand in
 California .  UnionBanCal will pay $46 a share in cash for the Santa
Barbara, California-based company, 60 percent above Pacific
Capital’s $28.69 closing price on March 9, UnionBanCal said
today in a statement. The deal is expected to be completed in
the fourth quarter, according to the statement.  The acquisition is UnionBanCal’s biggest, topping its
$307.4 million purchase of Jackson Federal Bank in 2004,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The transaction is also
among the top 10 largest bank deals announced this year, the
data show. UnionBanCal, which operates 414 branches in
California, Washington, Oregon, Texas and  New York , was acquired
by Tokyo-based  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)  for $3.61
billion in 2008.  “ Santa Barbara  and the central coast are very attractive
regions for banking and       wealth-management services, and
represent an important geographic expansion,” UnionBanCal Chief
Executive Officer Masashi Oka said in the statement.  Pacific Capital has $5.9 billion in assets and is the
parent company of Santa Barbara Bank & Trust, which has 47
branches in California. Pacific Capital’s shares have fallen 7.7
percent in the 12 months through March 9.  Morgan Stanley and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP provided
financial and legal advice to UnionBanCal. Pacific Capital was
advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
