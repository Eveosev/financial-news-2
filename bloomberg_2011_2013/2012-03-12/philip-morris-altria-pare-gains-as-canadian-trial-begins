U.S.-based tobacco companies Philip
Morris International Inc. and  Altria Group Inc. (MO)  pared gains as a
lawsuit seeking as much as C$27 billion ($27.2 billion) from
Canada’s three biggest cigarette makers went to trial.  New York-based Philip Morris, owner of Canadian tobacco
company Rothmans Benson & Hedges Inc., a defendant in the trial,
slipped 0.10 percent to $84.54 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York . The
stock had risen as much as 1.1 percent earlier in the day.
Richmond, Virginia-based Altria, which isn’t a defendant, fell
0.10 percent to $30.44.  The Quebec Superior Court in Montreal is hearing two class-
action lawsuits by smokers representing people seeking financial
compensation for harmful effects of smoking, the Canadian Cancer
Society said today in a statement.  Canada’s government has “legalized, heavily regulated and
taxed” the country’s tobacco industry, according to a statement
from  Imperial Tobacco  Canada, which called the lawsuits “an
opportunistic cash grab.”  Imperial Tobacco, a subsidiary of  British American Tobacco
Plc (BATS) , is a defendant along with JTI-MacDonald Corp., owned by
 Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) , and Rothmans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
