Vitro SAB (VITROA) ,  Mexico ’s largest
glassmaker, is temporarily shielded from attempts by bondholders
to collect on legal judgments or seize assets in the U.S., a
bankruptcy judge ruled today.  Bondholders with $1.2 billion in defaulted notes may
continue their pending litigation “to reduce their claims to
judgment,” Judge Harlin Hale wrote in a four-page ruling in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Dallas .  Hale set an April 9 hearing to consider whether Vitro’s
Mexican restructuring, approved by a Mexican judge last month,
is enforceable in the U.S. That reorganization is opposed by
bondholders who argued Vitro shouldn’t have been allowed to win
creditor approval of its plan by voting $1.9 billion of loans
between the parent and its subsidiaries.  “This order should not be construed by any party or touted
as a victory,” Hale wrote. “It is simply an attempt to
maintain the status quo for a short period until the ultimate
issue in the case, the enforceability of the Mexican plan” in
the U.S., can be decided, he said.  Vitro said in a statement that Hale’s order would protect
company assets in the U.S., “in particular, accounts receivable
owed from Vitro’s U.S. customers.”  A spokesman for bondholders declined to comment.  Vitro’s shares rose 0.1 percent to 17.15 pesos in Mexico
City.  The case is Vitro SAB de CV v. ACP Master Ltd. (In re Vitro
SAB de CV), 12-03027, U.S.  Bankruptcy Court , Northern District
of  Texas  (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
