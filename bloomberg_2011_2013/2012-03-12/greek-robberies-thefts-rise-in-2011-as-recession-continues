Thefts and robberies in  Greece 
increased by an average of 10 percent in 2011, the country’s
fifth year of recession.  The highest percentage of recorded offenses involved small
amounts of money or property which police referred to as crimes
of “emergency or survival” while violent, organized robberies
decreased, according to statistics on the Police  website 
yesterday.  Robberies increased to 6,636 in 2011 with 5,134 taking
place in the Attica region around Athens. Robbery increases were
recorded for homes, shops and gas stations, while bank robberies
dropped by more than half to 115 from 318 and post office
robberies declined to 71 from 95, with supermarket holdups
falling to 344 from 359, police said.  There were 96,925 thefts and burglaries in 2011, an
increase of 5,994 from the year before, with 56,852 offenses
taking place in the Attica region. The offenses include car
break-ins, purse snatching and pick-pocketing.  Greek police said they are increasing the number of
officers on the force’s rapid-response motorbike patrols by 195
members in the  Athens  area to 1,533 officers and the number will
gradually rise to 3,000 officers. The increase is part of an
“effort to strengthen the public confidence and tackle crime”,
according to a separate  statement  posted yesterday on the police
website.  Greece recorded 184 homicides in 2011 compared with 176 in
2010, police said. About 100,000 migrants were arrested trying
to enter Greece in 2011 down from 132,524 in 2010.  The government last month committed to additional austerity
measures to secure a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion) aid package
from the European Union and  International Monetary Fund .  Gross
domestic product contracted 7.5 percent in the fourth-quarter of
2011 and the country’s unemployment rate rose to a record 21
percent in December, with the rate for those under 24 at 51
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
