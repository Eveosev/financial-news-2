Kentor Gold Ltd. (KGL) ’s energy division
was awarded a geothermal-energy prospecting license in the south
Pacific’s  Solomon Islands  as it seeks to tap the earth’s heat
for power generation.  The islands’ government issued the three-year permit for
Savo Island, 35 kilometers (21 miles) from the capital Honiara,
the Australian company said today in a statement. Kentor plans
to supply electricity to the city, which currently relies on
diesel-fueled generation, it said.  Geothermal developments, which use energy from hot springs
or underground steam fields to produce power, are attracting
investments around the world as nations seek to meet rising
electricity demand without adding to  carbon emissions .  Kentor will study the feasibility of building a geothermal
power plant on Savo to “potentially supply the entire Honiara
grid and provide future extensions to other demand centers,”
the Brisbane-based company said. If the study is successful,
Kentor will start with a 20-megawatt unit, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
