Above-normal temperatures in the
eastern half of the U.S. will cut the amount of energy needed to
heat homes and business by 60 percent or more in the Midwest and
mid-Atlantic regions, forecasts say.  The U.S. heating-degree days value through March 17 is
forecast to be 56, or 82 lower than normal and 60 below last
year, according to the  U.S. Climate Prediction Center  in  Camp
Springs , Maryland.  Temperatures will range from 14 to 22 degrees Fahrenheit
(7.8 to 12.2 Celsius) above normal from the upper Great Plains
to  New York City , said David Salmon, owner of Weather
Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  Traders watch temperature predictions and heating degree
days values to gauge energy use and demand. About 51 percent of
U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the
Energy Department.  The high temperature in  New York  City may reach 71 degrees
tomorrow and the 60s for the rest of the week, according to the
National Weather Service.  Boston  may have 70 today.  The high in  Chicago  is forecast to be 69 today and may
reach 79 later this week, the  National Weather Service  said.
 Washington  is expected to see 79 by week’s end.  Heating-Degree Days  Heating-degree days values are calculated by subtracting
the daily average temperature from a base of 65 degrees to show
energy demand. Higher values mean cooler weather and more energy
being used to heat homes and businesses.  The gas-weighted value for the week is 59, or 92 lower than
normal and 67 below last year, according to the climate center.
The oil-weighted forecast is for 89, or 100 below normal and 73
lower than last year.  Salmon said temperatures will be warm enough in the South
that there won’t be an energy demand for heating this week.  The climate center predicted  Texas  would have a cooling-
degree days value of 34, or 21 above normal and 14 above last
year, while Louisiana would have 38, or 26 above normal and 27
above last year.  Cooling degree days values are similar to heating degree
days values, except designed to show how much energy is needed
to cool homes and businesses.  A base of 65 is subtracted from the daily average
temperature. The higher the vale, the warmer the weather and the
more energy is needed to run air conditioners.  Southern Warmth  Today’s high temperature in  Dallas  is expected to be 81 and
the high 70s for the rest of the week, according to the weather
service. Houston is expected to reach 80 tomorrow.  Other states where cooling-degree days values were
predicted this week include Alabama and Arizona at 12, Arkansas
and Oklahoma at 13, Mississippi at 17 and Florida at 43.  The warm weather is expected into the last week of March,
said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland .  Computer models predict a cold front may push into the
Midwest and eastern U.S. in about two weeks, which may lower
temperatures, Rogers said in his 11- to 15-day forecast.  In New York, the normal average temperature on March 17 is
about 43 degrees, according to  MDA EarthSat Weather  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. It’s 39 in Boston, 39 in Chicago, 55 in
Atlanta, 63 in Houston, 47 in Seattle and 59 in Burbank,
 California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
