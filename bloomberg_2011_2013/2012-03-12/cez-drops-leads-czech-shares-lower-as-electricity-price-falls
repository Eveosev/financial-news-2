CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest power utility
in the Czech Republic, fell to the lowest in more than a month
as the price of electricity declined after Chinese exports data
missed estimates.  The stock dropped as much as 1.6 percent to 794 koruna, its
lowest intraday level since Feb. 6, and traded down 1.2 percent
at 796.9 koruna by 11:02 a.m. in Prague. The 14-member  PX (PX)  gauge,
where CEZ has a 19 percent weighting, slid 0.4 percent.  Power for next-year delivery in Germany, where CEZ exports
part of its output, retreated 0.9 percent to 52.25 euros per
megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
