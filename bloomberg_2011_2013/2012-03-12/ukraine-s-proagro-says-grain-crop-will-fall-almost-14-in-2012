Ukraine’s grain harvest will
probably fall almost 14 percent to 45.7 million metric tons this
year as plantings decrease following drought, agriculture
researcher ProAgro said.  Farmer plantings will decline 5.1 percent from last year,
Nikolay Vernitsky, head of ProAgro, said in an e-mailed
statement today. Grain planting will drop to 15.2 million
hectares (37.64 million acres) from 16.05 million hectares, it
said. Wheat planting will decline to 5.5 million hectares from 7
million hectares, and the wheat harvest will drop 32 percent to
14.3 million tons, it said.  Corn planting will increase almost 20 percent to 4.35
million hectares from 3.63 million hectares in 2011, Kiev-based
ProAgro said. The corn harvest is estimated to rise 3.9 percent
to 21.3 million tons in 2012 from 20.5 million tons, it said.  ProAgro estimates Ukraine’s 2011 grain harvest was 53
million tons compared with a government estimate of 56.7 million
tons.  Ukraine’s  Agriculture Ministry  said that 1.75 million
hectares of winter grains will need to be re-seeded in spring
after winter frosts. As of March 7, winter grains sprouted on
7.27 million hectares, of which 23.6 percent of plants were in
good condition and 39.5 percent in satisfactory, and 29.7
percent were weak, according to the ministry’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
