The bankruptcy of Dynegy Holdings
LLC should be taken over by a court-approved trustee who will
better protect creditors, the U.S. Trustee monitoring the case
for the federal government said in court papers.  U.S. Trustee Tracy Hope Davis asked the judge presiding
over the case in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Poughkeepsie,  New
York , to approve an independent manager to run the energy
company.  “The mismanagement of the debtors by their current
management to the financial detriment of the debtors’ creditors
provides cause for the appointment of an independent
fiduciary,” Davis said in a March 11 filing.  Davis cited a court-ordered investigation released last
week that found Dynegy Holdings’ sale of coal-fired power plants
to its parent, Houston-based  Dynegy Inc. (DYN) , was a fraudulent
transfer and harmed creditors.  Dynegy Holdings filed for bankruptcy in November after
bondholders sued the company over the power-plant sale and
related reorganization, saying it moved assets out of their
reach to benefit shareholders of the parent, including
billionaire  Carl Icahn .  The case is In re Dynegy Holdings LLC, 11-38111, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Poughkeepsie).  To contact the reporters on this story:
