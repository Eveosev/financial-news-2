CapitaMall Trust (CT)  is selling its
second U.S. dollar-denominated bond, according to a person
familiar with the matter and  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The six-year notes are being marketed at a spread of about
312.5 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the
person said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Morgan Stanley and Standard
Chartered Plc were hired to help arrange the Reg S sale, the
person said.  CapitaMall Trust is the largest retail investment trust by
market value and asset size in Singapore, according to its
 website . The company first sold dollar bonds in March 2010, when
it offered $500 million of five-year notes with a 4.321 percent
coupon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Patricia Ng, a spokeswoman at  CapitaMalls Asia Ltd. (CMA) , wasnâ€™t
immediately available to comment on the bond sale when contacted
by phone and e-mail today. CapitaMall Trust is managed by
CapitaMall Trust Management Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
CapitaMalls Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
