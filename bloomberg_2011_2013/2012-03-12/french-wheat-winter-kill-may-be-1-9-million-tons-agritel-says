French soft-wheat production may be
slashed by 1.91 million metric tons after freezing weather in
the first two weeks of February devastated some fields, Paris-
based farm adviser Agritel said.  Winter kill destroyed 5.3 percent of planted wheat, cutting
output by 1.89 million tons, based on average yields,  Agritel 
wrote in a March 9 report, citing a survey of 2,105 farmers. The
cold damaged another 13 percent of fields to cut soft-wheat
potential production by 450,000 tons, while spring replanting
may add 429,400 tons of wheat, the farm adviser said.  May-delivery milling wheat has gained 8.4 percent on NYSE
Liffe in the French capital this year on concern about crop
damage, after temperatures in February fell below minus 15
degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) in  France ’s Alsace and
Lorraine regions with little protective snow cover.  “This survey provides evidence of damage that is greater
than the first estimates from recent weeks, particularly in soft
wheat,” Agritel wrote in the e-mailed report. “Nevertheless,
many crops were affected without being totally destroyed, which
makes their real evaluation difficult.”  Potential winterkill losses for winter barley are estimated
at 317,300 tons, while rapeseed production may be reduced by
108,300 tons because of the cold, according to Agritel. Durum-
wheat potential was cut by 112,100 tons, the adviser said.  “Durum wheat, rapeseed and winter barley came out better
than expected,” Agritel wrote. “On the European level, we’re
waiting for details on the damage in other countries,
particularly Germany and  Poland .”  Spring Planting  Increased spring planting may lift spring barley production
by 627,500 tons, based on average yields, while corn output
might climb by 599,600 tons, the farm adviser said. Output of
sunflower seed may advance 114,000 tons.  Agritel said it surveyed farmers by e-mail and through its
website, and responses may have been biased because those
affected by winterkill could have been more motivated to reply.  The surveyed farmers experienced temperatures of between
minus 22 degrees Celsius in the Loire to minus 9 Celsius in
Brittany, with average lows of minus 16 degrees Celsius,
according to the farm adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
