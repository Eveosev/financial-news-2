Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  may join banks unleashing more than $9 billion in dividend
increases and share buybacks if they get passing grades this
week on the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test.  Thirteen of the 19 largest U.S. lenders may say they’ll pay
out $3.79 billion in extra dividends this year and buy $5.52
billion of additional shares, according to estimates of six
analysts compiled by Bloomberg. That’s 30 percent more than they
spent last year. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo probably will
offer the biggest difference at a combined $4.16 billion,
followed by Citigroup with $2.92 billion.  “This is their opportunity to differentiate themselves
from their peers and competitors, and argue for a fresh look
from investors,” said  Matt McCormick , who helps oversee $5.1
billion at Bahl & Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati and focuses on
dividend-paying stocks. “You’ll see a lot of people saying the
banks are out of the woods.”  Investors are pressing lenders to restore dividends and
buybacks to levels that prevailed before the financial crisis,
when they were all but eliminated under terms of U.S. bailouts.
Dividends contributed about two-thirds of the total return for
stockholders during the decade before the 2008 crisis, as
measured by the  KBW Bank Index. (BKX)  The 24-company benchmark now
yields 1.8 percent, about half the average in 2007.  Wells Fargo  The  index rallied  16 percent this year through last week,
partly in anticipation that banks will get permission to
increase payouts after getting results of the stress tests,
which are due March 15. The gauge fell 0.7 percent as of 2:58
p.m. in New York, led by Regions Financial Corp., which dropped
3.1 percent, and  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , which slid 2.7 percent.  The Fed imposed the stress tests on 31 U.S. firms with at
least $50 billion in assets to ensure lenders can withstand
another crisis. The most dire scenarios call for unemployment to
hit 13 percent and a 20 percent slump in  home prices .  There’s still doubt that all the requests will be approved
and that investors will get the full amount that analysts are
predicting. As of last week, the Fed was pushing back against
some banks after concluding they underestimated potential losses
on  consumer debt  in a severe economic slump, according to two
people with knowledge of the situation. Examiners are still
fine-tuning calculations, which may change, the people said.  Wells Fargo, the most valuable U.S. lender, will offer
$1.39 billion in added dividends this year and an additional
$2.77 billion through share repurchases, for a combined increase
of 84 percent, the estimates show. That would boost the annual
payout to 75 cents a share from 48 cents. The buybacks equal
about 1.7 percent of the 5.27 billion  shares outstanding  based
on last week’s closing price.  Citigroup Payout  Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. lender by assets, could
distribute $744 million in higher dividends based on an increase
to 28 cents this year from 3 cents, the estimates show. The New
York-based firm may also buy about $2.18 billion in  shares ,
equal to 2.2 percent of the total. The bank didn’t repurchase
shares in 2011.  Citigroup will raise its payout, analysts estimate, even
though it’s restricted from boosting it as long as the U.S.
government holds a remaining $3.03 billion in trust-preferred
securities issued as part of emergency funding programs. The
restrictions can be waived, according to company filings.  Regulatory Mindset  The amount Citigroup is allowed to pay out will give good
insight into regulators’ thinking, KBW Inc. analysts led by
 David Konrad  wrote in a March 11 note. One of the Fed’s goals is
to limit capital leaving the banking system, they wrote, citing
concern that Europe’s turmoil still could spread to U.S.
markets.  “Although we believe Citi is on track to generate excess
capital within a two- to three-year time frame, we believe its
pro forma Basel III ratio may not be sufficient to begin
meaningful capital deployment,” the KBW analysts wrote,
referring to new minimum international standards that lenders
must meet. “Citi may be able to resubmit a plan for more
meaningful share repurchases after further sales of distressed
assets.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s annual payout may fall 28
percent to $4.9 billion, according to the consensus. The New
York-based investment bank may increase the annual dividend to
$1.47 a share from the current $1.40, and repurchase $4.17
billion in shares, or about 7 percent of the 495 million shares
outstanding. Total dividends and buybacks probably will be down
from last year when the company had more shares outstanding.  Consensus of Estimates  Mary Eshet, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the projected dividends and buybacks, as did Michael DuVally
of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup’s  Shannon Bell .  The dividend and buyback estimates were compiled from
reports written by analysts at International Strategy &
Investment Group Inc., Raymond James Financial Inc., Portales
Partners LLC,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Barclays Capital , and Oppenheimer
& Co. In most cases, the dividend estimates are based on the
current dividend rate prevailing in the first quarter, plus
three quarters of the higher payout.  Dividends historically have been sought by income-oriented
investors, and banks traditionally have been among the highest
payers. The yield for the 81-company Standard & Poor’s 500
Financials Index exceeded the broader  S&P 500  every year from
1998 through 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yield Shortage  Even with dividends, total return for the S&P Financials
was a negative 30 percent over the past decade, compared with a
44 percent gain for the S&P 500. As bank payouts increase, their
shares may be sought by a wider swath of buyers, said  Jason Goldberg , a senior bank analyst at Barclays Capital in New York.  “There is a search for yield, and to the extent bank
dividend yields increase, that makes them attractive to equity-
income investors,” Goldberg said in a phone interview last
week. “The industry is on much firmer ground.”  The Fed has said it will watch payouts closely. Regulators
limited banks to returning 60 percent of their retained earnings
to shareholders in 2011, split evenly between dividends and
share repurchases. Regulators will pay “particularly close
scrutiny” this year to banks asking permission for dividend
payouts of more than 30 percent in after-tax profit, the Fed
said in  instructions  it published in November.  The dividend for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , estimated to pay out
the most among the banks, would be 25 percent of 2012 earnings
as estimated by 23 analysts in a Bloomberg survey, while Wells
Fargo’s would be about 23 percent.  Payout Forecasts  Wells Fargo’s quarterly dividend may increase to 20 cents
in the second quarter, according to the Bloomberg Dividend
Forecast. Citigroup’s will climb to 5 cents and Goldman Sachs’s
will stay at 35 cents. The forecast is compiled using variables
that include company guidance, analysts’ predictions and trends.
It had a global accuracy rate of 83.7 percent last year,
compared with 71.4 percent accuracy by analysts.  Some banks won’t announce any increase.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) , struggling from shoddy mortgage loans that have cost
about $40 billion, didn’t ask to raise its dividend or buy back
stock in its capital request to the Fed, Chief Executive Officer
Brian T. Moynihan said during a March 8 investor conference. The
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender, ranked second by assets
after JPMorgan, pays a 1-cent quarterly dividend. The total
payout will nevertheless rise by about $16 million, or 4
percent, because more shares are outstanding.  Buffer Zone  Regions is focused on repaying the $3.5 billion in U.S.
bailout funds it still owes, finance chief  David Turner  said in
January. The amount is the largest outstanding for any public
commercial bank under the U.S. Treasury Department’s Troubled
Asset Relief Program. Regions, based in Birmingham, Alabama,
hasn’t reported an annual profit since 2007.  Regulators are allowing the largest U.S. banks to disburse
capital -- the buffer between a bank’s assets and liabilities
that helps shield depositors from losses -- as long as it
remains above 5 percent of assets under the stressed scenario.
U.S. commercial banks with at least $10 billion in assets
finished 2011 with a core capital ratio of 8.77 percent,
according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Loan losses
fell to $25.4 billion in the fourth quarter, the lowest in 15
quarters, the FDIC said.  In addition to approving or rejecting banks’ capital plans,
regulators could release bank-specific estimates of revenue,
losses and  capital ratios  under the adverse scenario. These
disclosures, perhaps more than the payout announcements, may be
the “most surprising,” Charles Peabody, an analyst at
Portales, wrote in a March 1 note.  Gap in Estimates  During the stress tests, the Fed has generally predicted
banks would suffer greater losses on credit cards and mortgage-
related holdings than what firms estimated in the plans they
submitted in January, said the people familiar with the process,
who asked not to be identified because the results aren’t
public.  Still, investors such as McCormick and Tom Mangan, who
helps oversee $3 billion at James Investment Research Inc. in
Xenia, Ohio, said they don’t expect the Fed to single out or
reject the capital plans of individual banks.  “Regulators can’t kick the legs out of the financial
industry at this point,” said Mangan, whose firm holds shares
of  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , KeyCorp and  PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. (PNC)  “It’s not their pattern to nail a bank
because then you create a run and the stock market drops overall
and you get angry voters.”  (Click here to see a table of projected dividend and payout
