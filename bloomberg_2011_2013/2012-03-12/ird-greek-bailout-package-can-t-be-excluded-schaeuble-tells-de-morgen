Greece  can achieve the goal of
cutting debt to 120.5 percent of economic output in 2020 though
a third bailout for the nation can’t be excluded, German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said in an interview with  De Morgen .  “Nobody can now exclude that Greece at a single moment may
need a third bailout,” the Belgian newspaper quoted Schaeuble
as saying. “I have all confidence that the measures that we
have taken and that Greece must now implement -- no simple
exercise -- will bring the country on the road to recovery.”  Schaeuble also said he opposes broadening the European
Central Bank’s mandate to something similar to that of the U.S.
Federal Reserve, according to  De Morgen . “The ECB cannot and
must not finance state debt,” Schaeuble said in the interview.
“The member states must do that themselves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
