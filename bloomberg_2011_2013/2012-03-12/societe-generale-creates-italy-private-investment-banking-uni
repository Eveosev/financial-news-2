Societe Generale SA (GLE) , France’s
second-largest bank, said it created a unit to advise clients
such as families on investments and raising capital.  Galeazzo Pecori Giraldi is head of private investment
banking and will oversee executives covering  Europe  and the
Middle East, the Paris-based bank said in an e-mailed statement
today. Pecori Giraldi joined Societe Generale two years ago as
vice chairman of the bank’s investment-banking committee and
previously worked for Morgan Stanley.  Societe Generale reported an 89 percent decline in fourth-
quarter profit on Feb. 16 as the investment bank posted a loss.
The new unit will assist clients in mergers as well as
investment strategies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
