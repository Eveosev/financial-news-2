Thailand’s baht fell for a second
day as Chinese trade data stoked concern exports will
deteriorate. Government bonds declined.  The Southeast Asian nation’s overseas sales were unchanged
in January from a year earlier after contracting 2 percent in
December, according to the median forecast of nine economists
surveyed by Bloomberg before figures are released this week. The
 MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares slid 0.2 percent after  China 
announced on March 10 its biggest trade deficit in at least 22
years, adding to signs of weakness in Asia’s biggest economy.  “Thai exports will be quite bumpy,” said  Vishnu Varathan ,
an economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in Singapore.
“China’s data has renewed concerns and the bigger picture
globally remains pretty soft.”  The baht fell 0.2 percent to 30.64 per dollar as of 9:30
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of currency swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 6.5250 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent government bonds due June
2017 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.42
percent according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
highest level in almost two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
