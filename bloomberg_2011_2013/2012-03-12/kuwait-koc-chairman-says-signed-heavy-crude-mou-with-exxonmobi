(Corrects expiry of MOU in second paragraph.)  Kuwait Oil Co. is still in talks
with ExxonMobil Corp. to develop heavy-crude deposits in
northern fields, the company’s chairman Sami al-Rushaid said.  KOC, as the company is known, signed a two-year memorandum
of understanding with ExxonMobil in 2007 to develop 700,000
barrels of heavy oil from the fields and the two parties didn’t
announce any major agreement since then.  “We are interested in talks with any international oil
company to develop the fields,” he said, including  Total SA. (FP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
