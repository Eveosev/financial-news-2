Greek banks may report accounting
losses of as much as 74 percent as they exchange old Greek
government bonds for new securities and accounting firms push
for conservative valuations on the lendersâ€™ books,  Euro2day.gr 
reported, without citing anyone.  Six accounting and professional services firms, including
PriceWaterhouseCooper LLC, Grant Thornton LLP and  KPMG ,
recommended that the recorded losses on old bonds be between 68
percent and 74 percent in order to be in line with the net
present value loss, the Athens-based website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
