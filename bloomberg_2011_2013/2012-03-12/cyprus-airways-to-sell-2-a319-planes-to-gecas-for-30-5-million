Cyprus Airways Ltd. (CAIR) , the island
country’s state-controlled carrier, said it signed a letter of
intent to sell two Airbus A319 planes to  GECAS Asset Management
Services Inc.  for a total of $30.5 million.  A sales and purchase agreement for the two short-to-medium
range aircraft with GECAS, a unit of  GE Capital , will be signed
when final terms are concluded and approved by the airline’s
board, the Nicosia-based carrier said today in a  filing  to the
Cyprus Stock Exchange.  Cyprus Airways said on Feb. 29 it had a pretax loss of 18.8
million euros ($24.6 million) in 2011, widening from a loss of 3
million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
