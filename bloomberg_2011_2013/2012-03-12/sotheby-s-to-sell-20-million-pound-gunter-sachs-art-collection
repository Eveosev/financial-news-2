The art collection of the late
Gunter Sachs, the German multimillionaire who was once married
to  Brigitte Bardot , will be sold at a May auction in London.  The 300 items, ranging from  Pop Art  works to Art Deco
furniture, will be offered on May 22-23 and are expected to
raise more than 20 million pounds ($31 million), New York-based
Sotheby’s said today in a statement.  The sale will include the Andy Warhol silkscreen paintings
“Flowers,” dating from 1964-65, and his 1974 portrait of
Bardot, based on a photo by Richard Avedon. Both are estimated
at 3 million pounds to 4 million pounds.  Sachs committed suicide at his chalet in Gstaad,
 Switzerland , at the age of 78, in May 2011.  Bardot became the second of Sach’s three wives in 1966. The
German auto heir and ex-bobsleigh champion courted the actress
by flying over her Cote d’Azur home, La Madrague,
in a helicopter and bombing it with red roses. The couple
divorced three years later.  Warhol’s painting of Bardot, commissioned by Sachs, was
based on a 1959 Avedon picture of the French actress. One of the
35 original silver prints of the image is included in the sale,
priced at 40,000 pounds to 60,000 pounds.  Andy’s Wig  Sachs became a friend of Warhol after the two met in St.
Tropez in the early 1960s. Sachs organized an exhibition for the
artist at his own gallery in Hamburg in 1972. As none of the
works sold on the opening night, Sachs bought half the show to
save his friend’s embarrassment, said  Sotheby’s. (BID)  Warhol’s 1986
pink “Fright Wig,” one of the artist’s last self-portraits, is
valued at 2 million pounds to 3 million pounds.  Many of the Pop Art works in the auction were acquired in
the late 1960s and early 1970s, either directly from the artists
or commissioned by Sachs to decorate his apartment in St.
Moritz, where he founded the Dracula Club. His bedroom at the
ski resort was furnished with a complete set of Allen Jones
mannequin furniture from 1969. Comprising a chair, table and hat
stand, these are valued at 30,000 pounds to 40,000 pounds each.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
