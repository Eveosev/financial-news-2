Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd. (SCBL) ,
the local unit of  Standard Chartered Plc, (STAN)  retreated to its
lowest level in almost a week, slipping for a second day, on
bets it will announce full-year profit dropped in 2011.  The shares fell as much as 3.4 percent to 170 shillings
before closing trading down 0.6 percent at 175 shillings by 3
p.m. in Nairobi, the lowest since March 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Both earnings per share and profit after tax could retreat
3.4 percent, Francis Mwangi, head of research at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.
StanChart, as the lender is known, could have a made a loss of
400 million shillings ($4.86 million) from sales of its holdings
in fixed-income securities, he said  “By the third quarter, earnings per share had declined 15
percent,” Mwangi said. “They were a bit quiet on lending for
the first half of 2011 then there was a substantial amount of
lending in quarter three.”  In the nine months through September, StanChart’s net
income declined to 3.86 billion shillings from 4.3 billion
shillings a year earlier, it said Nov. 23. The lender is
scheduled to report full-year earnings tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
