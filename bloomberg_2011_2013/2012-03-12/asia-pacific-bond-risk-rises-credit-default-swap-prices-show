The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
outside of  Japan  rose, according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan increased 2 basis points to 159 basis
points as of 8:26 a.m. in  Singapore , Barclays Plc prices show.
The measure is headed for its highest close since March 7,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index advanced 2 basis points
to 145 as of 11:26 a.m. in Sydney, according to Barclays. The
measure is set for its highest close since March 6, according to
data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell half a basis point to
138.5 basis points as of 9:31 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The gauge is poised to close at the lowest level
since Feb. 29, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
