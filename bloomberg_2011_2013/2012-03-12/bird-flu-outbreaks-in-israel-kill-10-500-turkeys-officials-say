Bird flu killed about 10,500
turkeys on two farms in western  Israel , the first outbreaks of
the deadly H5N1 strain in the country in 11 months, veterinary
officials said.  The virus threatens 51,000 8-week and 12-week-old Turkeys
on the farms in Hadarom, said Nadav Galon, Israelâ€™s director of
veterinary services and  animal health , in a March 9 report to
the World Organization for Animal Health in Paris. The outbreaks
began on March 7 and were confirmed the following day. The
source of the attack is being investigated, Galon said.  World health and veterinary officials have been monitoring
H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks in birds for the past decade
because of their potential to infect people. If the virus
becomes easily transmissible among humans, it could touch off a
deadly pandemic.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
