dropped 0.5 percent to 27,700 pesos. Banco BTG Pactual SA
analysts led by Alonso Aramburu cut their 2012 earnings-per-
share estimates after the company’s recent equity offering,
according to a research note dated March 9.  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA)  (PFAVTA CB), the owner of
Colombia’s biggest airline, gained 1.3 percent to 4,305 pesos.
Avianca Taca rose for a third day after the company proposed
what would be its first dividend payment.  “It’s a small yield but more important than the amount is
that the company is affirming that it already has the capacity
to distribute dividends,” said Santiago Melo, an analyst at
Alianza Valores SA. “Investors weren’t expecting it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
