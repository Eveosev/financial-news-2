Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB) ,  Mexico ’s second-
largest homebuilder, plans to meet with investors this week to
sell dollar bonds overseas, said a person familiar with the
company’s plans.  The Mexico City-based company hired Citigroup Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  to arrange the
meetings in the U.K. and the U.S., said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the discussions are private. The
meetings are scheduled to start March 14, said the person.  Moody’s Investors Service said Geo plans to sell as much as
$400 million of bonds maturing in 10 years, and the funds raised
will be used to pay down existing debt, including $250 million
of bonds maturing in 2014.  “With this proposed issuance, Geo will not have important
maturities of debt until 2020, which is a positive credit
factor,” Moody’s analysts Griselda Bisono and Nick Levidy wrote
in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
