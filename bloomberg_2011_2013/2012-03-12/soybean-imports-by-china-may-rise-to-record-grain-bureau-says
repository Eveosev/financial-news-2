Soybean purchases by  China , the
biggest buyer, may climb 7.7 percent this year to a record on
growing demand, according to the State Administration of Grain.  Imports for the year ending Dec. 31 may gain to 56 million
metric tons from 52 million tons last year, Nie Zhenbang,
director of the country’s top grain manager, said in speech to
members of the  Chinese People’s Political Consultative
Conference  in Beijing.  Increased buying may further spur a 10 percent rally in
prices this year. Imports by China doubled in 2005-2011 as
rising incomes and urbanization drove demand for meat, poultry
and dairy.  China’s shrinking land and water resources are testing its
ability to maintain grain self-sufficiency, Nie said in the
meeting held March 10. Like crude oil, its dependency on
overseas soybeans has exceeded 50 percent and “it’s
questionable whether such high dependency on imports is
sustainable,” Nie said.  Imports of soybeans in the marketing Oct. 1-Sept. 30 may
reach 55 million tons, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
forecast March 9. China’s current annual imports of soybeans and
cotton, of which it is also the largest buyer, would have taken
700 million mu of land to produce, according to Nie. In 2011
China’s grain planting totaled 1.66 billion mu, data by the
Ministry of Agriculture show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
