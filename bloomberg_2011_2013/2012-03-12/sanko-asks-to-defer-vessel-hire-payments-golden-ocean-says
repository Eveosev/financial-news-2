Golden Ocean Group Ltd. (GOGL) , an
operator of commodity-carrying ships, said Sanko Steamship Co.
asked to defer hire payments for a Capesize vessel.  The Golden Feng is chartered to Sanko at $46,000 a day
until Jan. 10, 2014, Oslo-based Golden Ocean said today in a
statement.  Sanko, which operates about 200 ships, said today it asked
creditors to defer payments after freight rates slumped amid a
global oversupply of vessels and rising fuel prices. The Tokyo-
based company has asked shipowners, shipyards and lenders for a
standstill agreement and intends to eventually pay all debts, a
March 9 statement showed.  Sanko owns 41 of the ships it operates, according to
vessel-owning data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
