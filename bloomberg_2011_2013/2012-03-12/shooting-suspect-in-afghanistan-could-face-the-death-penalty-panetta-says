Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  said
today that the U.S. soldier who allegedly shot to death 16
Afghan civilians may face the death penalty.  The soldier, an Army staff sergeant from Fort Lewis-McChord
in Washington state, may face capital punishment in the
shootings, depending on the investigation and any resulting
charges in the military justice system, Panetta said.  “My understanding is, in these instances, that could be a
consideration,” Panetta told reporters traveling with him to
Kyrgyzstan. “We are following the procedures that we follow in
these situations to review the case and then bring appropriate
charges.”  Panetta appealed for the U.S., Afghanistan and their
coalition partners to stick with their strategy to end the war
and not let recent violence deter their efforts.  “War is hell,” Panetta said en route to Kyrgyzstan, the
location of an air base that resupplies troops in  Afghanistan .
“These kinds of events and incidents are going to take place.
But we cannot allow these events to undermine our strategy or
the mission.”  The forces involved should learn from such incidents to
ensure they don’t recur, Panetta said.  “But having said that, it’s important that we push on and
that we bring this war to a responsible end,” he said. “I do
not believe that there is any reason to make any changes with
regards to our strategy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
