The ruble depreciated against the
dollar, trimming yesterday’s advance, as the price of oil, the
country’s chief export, fell from its highest level in a week.  The Russian currency lost 0.4 percent to 29.6425 per dollar
by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, after advancing 0.6 percent
yesterday, the most since Feb. 24. The ruble slid 0.2 percent to
38.90 against the euro and 0.3 percent to 33.8084 versus the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket.  Crude for April delivery declined 1 percent to $106.28 a
barrel in  New York , after exports grew more slowly than forecast
in  China , the world’s second-largest crude consumer and  Russia ’s
biggest trading partner after the European Union.  Russia’s ruble bonds due April 2021 were little changed,
leaving the yield one basis point lower at 7.86 percent. The
yield on the country’s sovereign dollar bonds maturing in 2020
fell six basis points to 3.88 percent, the lowest since the
notes were sold in April 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
