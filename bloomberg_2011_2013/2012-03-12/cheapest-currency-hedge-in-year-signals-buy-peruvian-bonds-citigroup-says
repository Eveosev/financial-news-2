Citigroup Inc. (C)  recommended
investors buy local Peruvian bonds and take advantage of the
cheapest foreign-exchange hedging costs in a year.  Citigroup advises its clients to buy sol-denominated bonds
due in September 2013, which yield 3.44 percent, and hedge
through cross-currency swaps at a cost of 1.5 percent,  New York- 
based strategists Dirk Willer and Ram Bala Chandran wrote in a
note to clients.  Peru’s sol is trading at the strongest level in 15 years
after companies stepped up their currency purchases to pay local
taxes, prompting the central bank to buy dollars to stem the
rally. The central bank purchases dry up the supply of the U.S.
currency in the domestic market, making it cheaper to sell soles
versus the dollar in the non-deliverable forwards market.  “By soaking up the dollars you create a shortage of
dollars onshore and forward points collapse,” Willer said by
telephone.  One-month  implied yield  on the sol forwards, a measure of
the costs to hedge the sol, dropped to a one-year-low of 0.71
percent on March 1, from 3.56 percent at the end of 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The implied yield,
derived from the difference between the spot and forward prices,
was 0.97 percent today, compared with the central bank’s
benchmark interest rate of 4.25 percent.  The trade allows investors to pick up higher yields than
the  three-month London interbank rate , which is at 0.5 percent,
without taking the  currency risk , according to the strategists.  Peru’s central bank has bought $4.6 billion in the  spot
market  this year, surpassing the $3.5 billion it purchased in
all of 2011. It bought $9 billion in 2010.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6695 per  U.S. dollar  at today’s
close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The currency
earlier touched 2.6670, the strongest since 1997, data from
Peru’s financial regulator show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
