San Antonio Spurs guard T.J. Ford
is retiring from the  National Basketball Association  after an
eight-year career plagued by neck and spine injuries.  Ford, 28, made the announcement this afternoon on his
Twitter page. In a statement issued earlier today through the
Spurs, Ford said he was taking an indefinite leave of absence
because of injuries, most recently a pinched nerve in his neck
sustained March 7 against the  New York Knicks .  Selected by Milwaukee with the eighth pick in the 2003 NBA
Draft, Ford played for the Bucks, Toronto Raptors and  Indiana
Pacers . He averaged 3.6 points and 3.2 assists in 14 games with
San Antonio this season.  Ford missed the 2004-05 season due to a spinal cord injury.
His best season was 2006-07 with Toronto, when the guard
averaged 14 points per game and finished with 595 assists, fifth
most in the NBA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
