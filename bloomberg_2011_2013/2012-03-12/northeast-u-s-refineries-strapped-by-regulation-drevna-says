U.S. Northeast refineries are in an
“economic and regulatory vise,” according to the American Fuel
& Petrochemical Manufacturers.  Refiners in the region face regulatory obstacles as well as
a difficult economy,  Charles Drevna , president of trade group,
said today at a press conference in San Diego.  Fuel production in the East Coast tapered off after  Sunoco
Inc. (SUN)  shut its  Marcus Hook ,  Pennsylvania , refinery, and
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  idled the Trainer plant. Sunoco plans to shut its
Philadelphia refinery by July if it isn’t sold. Together the
facilities can process about 45 percent of the region’s refining
capacity.  The group, formerly known as the National Petrochemical &
Refiners Association, is a trade association for fuel
manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
