Belarus’s central bank unveiled a
200,000-ruble ($24) banknote, twice the denomination of its
current largest bill, aiming to lighten people’s wallets after
the national currency lost two-thirds of its value last year.  “The decision to issue the new note was made in order to
improve the cashflow structure,” central bank Deputy Chairman
Vladimir Senko told reporters today in the Natsionalnyi Bank
Respubliki’s headquarters in the capital, Minsk.  The new bill is green-colored and depicts an art museum in
the eastern city of Mogilev. The former Soviet republic saw its
currency depreciate 64 percent against the dollar last year as
inflation soared to 108.7 percent. A Belarusian citizen will
need 14 new banknotes and a little extra change to pocket an
average monthly salary of 2.9 million rubles.  While consumer prices  rose  107.4 percent in February from a
year earlier, the monthly rate slowed to 1.5 percent from 1.9
percent in January, the Minsk-based state statistics committee
said on its website today. The government and the central bank
declared battling inflation as their priority and seek to cap
price growth at 19 percent to 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
