Cornerstone OnDemand Inc. (CSOD) , a  Santa
Monica , California-based provider of human-resources software,
fell the most in five months following the third-largest trade
of the year.  Cornerstone OnDemand lost 5.2 percent to $20.98 at the
close in  New York , the biggest drop since Oct. 31. Volume of
994,204 was almost four times the three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares
have risen 15 percent this year.  Several big trades in the past five weeks indicate some
large investors continue to reduce stakes, as a handful did last
year at lower prices. A  block  of 90,000 opened trading today at
$20.95, 5.3 percent below the closing price on March 9.  “We have seen a rotation out of the company by a couple of
shareholders” who owned the stock before the IPO, said Scott Berg, a Feltl & Co. analyst in  Minneapolis  who has a buy rating
with a $25 price target.  An insider-sales window opened up this week for the first
time since early December, Chief Executive Officer  Adam Miller 
said in an interview. Earnings and an acquisition combined to
create an unusually long black-out period, Miller said. He said
he didn’t know details of the block trade.  “Insiders will only be allowed to sell this week before
the next blackout period begins,” Miller said.  Cornerstone OnDemand went  public  a year ago, selling 10.5
million shares at $13 each. Management, directors and their
affiliates own 40 percent of the stock, according to the 2011
annual report. The company had about 39.8 million shares
outstanding at the end of the year, the report showed.  Sales Growth  Cornerstone OnDemand provides software to help companies
manage employee compensation, performance and training. As of
Dec. 31, it had 805 clients.  Today’s trade followed blocks of 192,603 on Feb. 27 and
151,000 on Feb. 9.  According to regulatory filings for the period ended Dec.
31,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  reduced its stake to 22,550 shares
from 1.48 million, while  AllianceBernstein LP (AB)  cut its holding by
798,370 to 1.01 million.  “They are one of the fastest-growing companies in the
software space,” Berg said.  Analysts project sales will rise 51 percent this year to
$113.7 million, the average of seven  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The annual loss will narrow to 27 cents, excluding
items, from 52 cents in 2011. Nine analysts  recommend  buying the
stock, and one says sell. Their average 12-month target price is
$22.86.  To contact the reporter on this story:
