U.S. Steel Corp. (X) , the country’s
largest producer of the metal by volume, sold $400 million of
10-year bonds, according to a person familiar with the offering.  The 7.5 percent notes priced at par to yield 548 basis
points more than Treasuries of similar maturity, said the
person, who declined to be identified.  U.S. Steel, rated two levels below investment grade at BB
by  Standard & Poor’s , is taking advantage of a rally in risky
assets that’s driven down the yield on its debt to refinance
another bond before it comes due next year. The Pittsburgh-based
company intends to use proceeds to pay off its $300 million of
5.65 percent notes due 2013, S&P said today in a statement.  The yield on U.S. Steel’s $600 million of 7.375 percent
notes due in April 2020 has fallen to 6.9 percent from as high
as 9.4 percent in October, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Average yields on speculative-grade bonds, rated lower than
BBB- by S&P and below Baa3 at Moody’s Investors Service, have
declined to 7.6 percent as of March 9 from as high as 10.2
percent on Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
