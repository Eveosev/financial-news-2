Kuwait  pumped about 3 million
barrels of oil a day last month, Farouk Al-Zanki, the chief
executive of state-run Kuwait Petroleum Corp. said.  KPC has a contingency plan if the Strait of Hormuz at the
entrance to the Persian Gulf becomes closed, he said today in
Kuwait, without providing any details. Demand for the company’s
crude oil “still looks good.”  Brent crude  has gained 16 percent this year in London to
about $125 a barrel mainly on concern conflict with Iran could
choke off oil exports from the gulf, limiting supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
