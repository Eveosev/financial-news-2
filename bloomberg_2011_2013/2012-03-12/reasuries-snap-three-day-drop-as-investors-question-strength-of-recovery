Treasuries (YCGT0025)  notes pared gains as
speculation eases that the  Federal Reserve  will hint at
additional asset purchases and an auction of $32 billion of
three-year debt attracted lower-than-forecast demand.  The three-year notes drew a yield of 0.456 percent,
compared with the average forecast of 0.450 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of six of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers.
The Treasury will sell $21 billion in 10-year notes tomorrow,
when the  Federal Open Market Committee  meets. The U.S. will sell
$13 billion of bonds the next day.  “The auctions will go fine,” said Dan Mulholland, a
Treasury trader in New York at RBC Capital Markets LLC, one of
the 21 primary dealers required to bid at government debt
auctions. “It’s just finding a level where people care: 2.05
percent to 2.10 percent on the 10-year. We’re not expecting a
lot out of the Fed meeting, just the status quo.”  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes were little changed at
2.04 percent at 4:59 p.m.  New York  time, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. The yield had dropped earlier to 1.99
percent. The price of the 2 percent securities maturing in
February 2022 fell 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face value to 99
22/32.  The current three-year note yields were little changed at
0.45 percent. Yields on 30-year  bonds  decreased one basis point
to 3.17 percent.  At today’s three-year note auction, indirect bidders, an
investor class that includes foreign central banks, purchased
34.6 percent of the notes, compared with an average of 36.8
percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct Bidders  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8.9 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 11.1 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  “There were a couple of things working against the
auction. You had high dealer long positions in the sector, and
foreigners have been backing out of threes lately,” said  Scott Sherman , an  interest-rate  strategist in New York at Credit
Suisse Group AG, a primary dealer. “Not a bad result,
especially with the Fed selling so many threes.”  Thirty year-bonds led today’s gains as the central bank
purchased $1.969 billion of Treasuries maturing from February
2036 through February 2042 today under its program to replace
$400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-
term Treasuries to reduce borrowing costs and counter risks of a
recession.  Focus on Twist  The so-called Operation Twist may lower the 10-year note
yield by about 85 basis points, compared with a reduction of 164
basis points under the two rounds of debt purchases known as
quantitative easing, the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for
International Settlements said in a report released yesterday.  “People are going to be focused on the Twist,” said
 William Larkin , a fixed-income  money manager  who helps oversee
$500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc. in Salem,
 Massachusetts . “The 10-year is glued at 2 percent.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Jan. 25 after the
Federal Open Market Committee’s last gathering that policy
makers were considering additional asset purchases to boost
growth. The central bank also extended a pledge to keep the
benchmark interest rate at almost zero through at least late
2014. The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities under the two
rounds of QE from December 2008 to June 2011.  Commercial lenders purchased $78.2 billion of Treasuries
and securities of agencies in January and February, compared
with $62.6 billion in all of 2011, bringing their  holdings  to
$1.78 trillion, Fed data show. Deposits exceeded loans by a
record $1.63 trillion last month, up from $1.17 trillion in
January 2011, providing scope to buy more bonds.  Greek Concern  U.S. debt securities rose earlier on concern  Greece  will
need further international assistance after its debt swap.  Greece faces “significant challenges” in the coming years
to achieve fiscal targets required to satisfy conditions for
international support and may not regain  market access  when its
second bailout expires, Moody’s Investors Service said in its
Weekly Credit Outlook.  Treasury 10-year yields will advance to 2.52 percent by
Dec. 31, according to the average forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey, with the most recent projections given
the heaviest weightings. The yields have been in a range of 1.79
percent to 2.09 percent this year.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures
price swings based on options, dropped to 73.2 on March 9, near
the 70.2 basis points reached Feb. 2 that was the lowest since
July 2007. The measure has tumbled from 117.8 on Aug. 8 as
central banks stepped up efforts to ease tension in financial
markets.  Treasury market volume rose March 9 to the highest since
March 1. About $265 billion of Treasuries changed hands through
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker, compared with
the one-year average of $276 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
