President  Barack Obama  said the
“tragic” killing of at least 16 Afghan civilians, allegedly by
a U.S. Army staff sergeant, hasn’t altered his strategy for
turning over security responsibility to local forces by 2014.  The incident shows “the importance of us transitioning in
accordance with my plans” so that Afghans take the lead in
security and U.S. troops can come home, Obama said in an
interview with WFTV Television in Orlando,  Florida . He also said
“it’s not going to get any easier” for U.S. troops in
 Afghanistan  over the next few months.  In response to a question, Obama said the shooting in
Afghanistan is “not comparable” to the 1968 massacre of more
than 300 hundred civilians by a group of U.S. soldiers in My Lai
during the  Vietnam War .  “It appears that you had a lone gunman who acted on his
own in just a tragic, tragic way,” Obama said in the interview,
one of eight he conducted today with local and regional news
programs.  A suspect, whose name hasn’t been released, was being held
in pretrial confinement by the U.S. military in Kandahar,
Afghanistan’s second-largest city, according to the U.S. Defense
Department.  “In no way is this representative” of members of the U.S.
armed forces, Obama said. The president said he talked to Afghan
President  Hamid Karzai  “and expressed my condolences.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
