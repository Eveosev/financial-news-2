Gorenje Group d.d ., Slovenia’s
biggest appliance maker, reported a 55 percent decline in 2011
profit as raw-material costs increased and demand for its
products dropped.  Net income plunged to 9.1 million euros ($11.9 million)
from 20 million euros in 2010, the Velenje, Slovenia-based
company said in a  statement  to the Ljubljana stock exchange
today. Revenue advanced 2.9 percent to 1.4 billion euros.  Gorenje (GRVG) , Slovenia’s second-biggest exporter after Renault
SA’s subsidiary in Novo Mesto, said the business environment
last year was “hostile” and sales “under heavy pressure from
high raw and processed material prices, and currency and credit
risks, paired with feeble consumer demand.”  The company this year plans to reduce debt further and
refinance some liabilities as well as cut costs and boost sales
by “restructuring its manufacturing sites,” Gorenje Chief
Executive Officer Franjo Bobinac wrote in the statement.  Gorenje lowered debt by 4.7 percent in 2011 by “intensive
divestment of non-core assets.” The share of long-term loans in
total liabilities rose to 62.5 percent from 53.9 percent,
according to the company’s statement.  The company will focus on global expansion, including the
 Middle East  and  Hong Kong , “responding to expected low growth on
European markets, where the bulk of our sales are now
generated,” according to the statement.  Its shares slumped 4.8 percent to 4.55 euros at 11:33 a.m.
in Ljubljana, falling for the first time in four days and
valuing the company at 72 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
