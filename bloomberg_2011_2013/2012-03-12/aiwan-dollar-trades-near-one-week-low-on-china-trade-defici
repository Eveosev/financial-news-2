Taiwan ’s dollar traded near a one-
week low after data showed  China , the island’s biggest export
market, had its largest trade deficit since at least 1989.  The shortfall for February was $31.5 billion, China’s
customs bureau said on March 10, as  Europe ’s debt crisis crimped
exports and imports rebounded after the Lunar New Year holidays.
Taiwan central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan will say in a
prepared speech to be delivered today that he expects export
growth to slow this year. The island’s overseas sales rose 10.3
percent in February from a year earlier, compared with a 16.8
percent decline in January, official data show.  “External demand is still weak,” said Teck Kin Suan, an
economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “The
 Taiwan dollar  will be on the weaker side.”  Taiwan’s dollar traded at NT$29.510 against its U.S.
counterpart as of 9:42 a.m. local time, compared with NT$29.504
on March 9, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched
NT$29.590 on March 8, the weakest level since Feb. 29. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of price swings that options
traders use, dropped three basis points to 4.67 percent.  The yield on the 1 percent bonds due January 2017 was
little changed at 0.965 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The overnight  money-market  rate fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 0.392 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
