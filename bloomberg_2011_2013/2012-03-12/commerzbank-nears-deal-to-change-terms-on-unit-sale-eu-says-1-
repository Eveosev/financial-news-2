Commerzbank AG (CBK) , a German lender
rescued by taxpayers following the 2008 financial crisis, is
“close” to a deal with European Union regulators to change the
terms of the bailout that required it to sell its Eurohypo unit.  EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said European
Commission officials and Commerzbank were discussing “what
other conditions can compensate” for the bank’s request to
change the EU’s order for it to sell Eurohypo by the end of
2014. Regulators “are very, very close to having an agreement
to have a change of conditions for Commerzbank,” he told
reporters today.  Commerzbank agreed to sell the public-finance and
commercial-property lender as a condition for EU approval of its
rescue by the German state following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.  Germany ’s second-biggest lender has said
a sale of Eurohypo would be difficult because of concerns over
the division’s ability to fund itself.  Commerzbank spokesman Maximilian Bicker declined to comment
when reached by telephone today. Chief Executive Officer  Martin Blessing  told reporters at a press conference at the bank’s
headquarters in Frankfurt last month that Commerzbank won’t
provide updates on talks with the commission.  Eurohypo tapped the European Central Bank’s three-year
loans in December to reduce the unit’s funding dependence on
Commerzbank, Chief Financial Officer  Eric Strutz  told analysts
on a Feb. 23 conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
