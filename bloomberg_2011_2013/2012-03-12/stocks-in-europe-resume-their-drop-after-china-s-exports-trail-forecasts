European stocks resumed a retreat
as data today showed that  China ’s exports grew at a slower pace
than forecast. U.S. futures and Asian shares also fell.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.3 percent to 264.62 at
12:13 p.m. in  London  after briefly erased losses. Futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June fell 0.2 percent
today and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.6 percent.  China reported its biggest trade deficit last month
since at least 1989. The data adds to reports last week on
factory output and retail sales that signaled slowing growth for
the world’s second-biggest economy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
