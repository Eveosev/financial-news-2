Domodedovo, the largest airport in
Russia and Eastern Europe, signed a 165 million-euro ($216
million) loan.  The five-year facility pays interest of 280 basis points
more than the euro interbank offered rate and will be used for
general corporate purposes, according to a  statement  on the
Moscow-based airportâ€™s website.  ING Groep NV,  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  and  Rosbank (ROSB) 
arranged the deal, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
