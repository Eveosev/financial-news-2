Australia midfielder  Brett Holman 
reached an agreement to join  Aston Villa  from AZ Alkmaar at the
end of the season, the Premier League team said.  The 27-year-old Holman, who’s scored eight goals in 53
games for the Socceroos, signed a pre-contract agreement to join
the Midlands club when his deal with the Dutch Eredivisie leader
expires, Villa said on its website.  “Brett is a very intelligent player, a great team player
and a man who is recognised in the game as a non-stop, committed
wide midfield player,” said Villa manager Alex McLeish.  Holman has spent the past 10 years in the Netherlands,
where he also played for Feyenoord, Excelsior and NEC Nijmegen.
He moved to Alkmaar in 2008 and helped the club win the Dutch
title in his first season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
