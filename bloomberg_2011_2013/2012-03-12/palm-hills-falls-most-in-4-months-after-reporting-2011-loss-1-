Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC)  tumbled
the most in almost four months after the Egyptian developer of
luxury property reported a 2011 loss that was more than
estimated following last year’s popular uprising.  The shares declined 5.6 percent, the most since Nov. 14, to
2.03 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, valuing
the company at 2.13 billion pounds ($353 million). That pared
the stock’s surge to 86 percent this year. The benchmark  EGX 30
Index retreated  1.5 percent today.  Palm Hills said it had  a loss  of 331.3 million pounds in
2011, compared with a profit of 526.4 million pounds in the
previous year. The median of five analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg was for a loss of 32 million pounds. Annual revenue
fell to 560.1 million pounds from 1.7 billion pounds a year-
earlier, the Cairo-based company said in a filing to the
Egyptian bourse today.  “ Palm Hills  has traditionally targeted the upper-end of
the market which has slumped because of the unrest,” said Hany
Samy, director at CI Capital Research who has a hold rating on
the shares.  The  EGX 30 Real Estate Index (EGXREAL)  declined 3.9 percent today,
trimming this year’s advance to 58 percent. The gauge lost 67
percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
