PetroEcuador, the South American
country’s state-owned oil company, said it may have natural gas
reserves worth about $4 billion in an off-shore field in the
country’s Gulf of Guayaquil.  Block 6, as the field is known, has possible reserves of
1.7 trillion cubic feet of gas, up from earlier estimates of 250
billion, Paulina Arias, a PetroEcuador spokeswoman, said today
by telephone from  Quito .  To contact the reporter on this story:
