Romania ’s governing coalition
approved an increase in public-sector wages from June 1,
 Mediafax  reported, citing a party official.  Prime Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu’s Cabinet must decide
on the size of the increases, depending on budget limits, Mircea
Toader, the head of the Democratic-Liberal Party’s group in the
lower house of Parliament, said today, according to the
Bucharest-based news service.  President Traian Basescu urged the government to find ways
to raise the income of public-sector workers to the level before
a 25 percent cut in June 2010. Romania will hold local and
general elections this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
