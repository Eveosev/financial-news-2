The  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan , or
Socar, will receive the first oil-product shipment at its new
Fujairah terminal in the  United Arab Emirates  within the next
two weeks, the company said.  The initial phase of the company’s Fujairah terminal
project has finished construction and is ready for use, Socar
said in an e-mailed statement today. It has a storage capacity
of 114,000 cubic meters, or about 640,000 barrels, of oil.  “The first cargo of fuel oil destined to the newly
constructed terminal in Fujairah is on its way,” Christian von
Langermann, head of Socar Trading Dubai, said in the statement.  The entire Fujairah facility will have a total capacity of
641,000 cubic meters, the company said, declining to provide a
timetable for the entire project’s construction. The 20 tanks
will be able to store  fuel oil , gasoline, naphtha, middle
distillate products and blending components.  To contact the reporter on this story:
