OAO Gazprombank (GZPR) , a lending affiliate
of  Russia ’s gas-export monopoly  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , will have a venture
operating in  Serbia  in the second half of the year with Serbian
gas monopoly  Srbijagas ,  Blic  newspaper reported, citing
Srbijagas’s general director.  Gazprombank will own two-thirds of the new bank, seen as a
greenfield investment supporting projects such as the South
