JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  is seeking
permission to operate nonstop flights to  San Juan ,  Puerto Rico 
and to Austin,  Texas  from  Ronald Reagan Washington National
Airport  as the airport adds long-distance routes for the first
time since 2004.  JetBlueâ€™s flights would be the only nonstop service between
National and those two cities, the New York-based carrier said
today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
