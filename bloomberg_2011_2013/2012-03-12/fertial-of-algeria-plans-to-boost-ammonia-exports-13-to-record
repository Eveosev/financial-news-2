Fertial SpA , an Algerian fertilizer
company, expects to increase ammonia exports by 13 percent this
year to a record as demand for crop nutrients climbs.  Fertial plans to ship 700,000 metric tons, up from 620,000
tons in 2011, Director-General Jorge Requena Lavergne said in an
interview in Algiers on March 8. The company exports 80 percent
of its ammonia and uses the rest to make fertilizers.  Consumption of the gas has grown as burgeoning populations
boost food demand, spurring farmers to plant more crops. Fertial
has an output capacity of 1 million tons of ammonia a year and
produces 200,000 tons of fertilizer for the domestic market,
according to Requena Lavergne.  Spain ’s Grupo Villar Mir, which owns 66 percent of Fertial,
plans to invest $20 million in the company this year to upgrade
production equipment, he said.  Algeria ’s Asmidal holds the
remaining shares.  -- Editors: Amanda Jordan, Stephen Cunningham  To contact the reporter on this story:
