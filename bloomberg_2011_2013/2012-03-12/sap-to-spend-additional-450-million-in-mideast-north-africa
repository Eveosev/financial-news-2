SAP AG (SAP) , the biggest maker of
business management applications, said it will invest an
additional $450 million in the  Middle East  and North Africa over
four years to extend its lead in the region.  SAP plans to add 500 workers to about 300 employees it has
in the region, Daniel Reinhardt, a spokesman for the Walldorf,
Germany-based company, said by phone today. He declined to
quantify current investment. SAP also will set up a training
institute to certify 2,000 software consultants over the period,
it said in a statement.  SAP, whose biggest rival is  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , aims to boost 
 annual revenue  to more than 20 billion euros ($26.2 billion) by
2015 as it rolls out on-demand software, mobile applications 
and the rapid Hana “in-memory” computing technology. By then, 
the company said it expects to “significantly” increase sales 
in the Middle East and North Africa.  The region “is remarkable in its growth potential, scope
and readiness to innovate,” Chief Financial Officer Werner Brandt said in the statement. “SAP’s additional investment
will enable us to deliver leading-edge innovation, better
localization and more talent.”  SAP said its market share in the region exceeds 37 percent,
citing research by IDC.  To contact the reporters on this story:
