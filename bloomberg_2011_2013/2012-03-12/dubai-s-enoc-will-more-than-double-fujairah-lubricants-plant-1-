Emirates National Oil Co., the
government-owned refiner in Dubai, will more than double
lubricants production capacity at a plant in the neighboring
emirate of Fujairah over the next two years to boost exports.  The plant on the eastern coast of the  United Arab Emirates 
is producing 100,000 metric tons of lubricants a year and the
company will expand the facility’s capacity to make 250,000 tons
of lubricants and grease by 2014, Zaid Alqufaidi, ENOC’s
managing director for marketing, said today.  “We have great potential for export,” Alqufaidi said in
an interview at the plant inauguration. The blending facility,
which started production a year ago, exports about 60 percent of
its goods to markets in  Asia ,  Africa  and the  Middle East .  Fujairah is the U.A.E.’s main oil products port outside the
Strait of Hormuz, a choke point for about a fifth of the world’s
crude exports. ENOC and companies including Vitol group and
Royal Vopak NV operate oil product storage facilities in the
emirate. The port of Fujairah serves as the main regional ship
refueling, or bunkering, and fuel import and export hub.  ENOC buys base oil from refiners in  Europe  and Saudi Arabia
for blending with additives to create the lubricants, Alqufaidi
said. Suppliers include Exxon Mobil Corp.’s  Augusta refinery  in
Italy and Saudi Aramco Lubricating Oil Refining Co., a venture
of Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil producer, Muhammed Yunus,
manager of the Fujairah plant, said during a tour of the
facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
