Smaller bonus checks across Wall
Street indicate  New York City  luxury real-estate prices may be
on the way down.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the relationship between average
Wall Street annual bonuses, lagged two years, and the average
price for luxury condos and co-ops in  New York  City, based on
data from the Office of the New York State Comptroller and real-
estate appraiser Miller Samuel Inc.  The average price for a luxury co-op or condo in New York
fell to $5.49 million in 2011 from a peak of $6.33 million in
2008, according to data compiled by Miller Samuel, which defines
“luxury” homes as those falling within the top 10 percent of
transactions by price. The average  Wall Street  bonus fell 13
percent last year to $121,150, the lowest since 2008, and almost
40 percent less than the $191,360 reached in 2006, according to
projections by New York State Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli .  Declining bonuses in 2011 may bode poorly for luxury real-
estate prices this year and next, according to Miller Samuel
president  Jonathan Miller , noting a lag between lower
compensation and sales and prices. “People are making decisions
a year or more down the road because they’re getting their
deferred cash,” he said. “We may see a little weakness in
2012,” and “next year could be weaker based on this trend of
lower compensation.”  Wall Street firms trimmed 2011 discretionary pay as
investment-banking and trading revenues slumped. At Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and  Barclays Capital , the cuts were at least 25
percent. Morgan Stanley capped cash bonuses at $125,000, and
Deutsche Bank AG increased the percentage of deferred pay.  Lower compensation for bankers means “the best case
scenario for 2012 is more of the same,” Miller said. “The
Manhattan housing market specifically remains one of the best in
the country -- but that’s a relative statement.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
