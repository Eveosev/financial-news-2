KazMunaiGaz National Co.,
 Kazakhstan ’s state energy producer, will raise $2.5 billion
selling bonds to the  National Oil Fund (KAIRNOF)  in 2013, removing the
need to borrow abroad this year.  KazMunaiGaz (KMGZ)  is in talks with the government about the  interest
rate , the Astana-based oil and gas producer said by e-mail
today. The company will sell a second tranche of bonds to borrow
$1.5 billion from the oil fund in 2015, it said.  The funds will be invested in the Kashagan oil development,
one of the world’s biggest fields, according to a Feb. 29
statement from President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s press office.
KazMunaiGaz has about $3.2 billion of  debt  coming due by the end
of next year, out of a total of $13.6 billion outstanding,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  KazMunaiGaz plans to increase investment spending 7 percent
to $3.8 billion this year, followed by $2.3 billion in 2013,
according to Raiffeisen Research.  The central Asian country’s National Oil Fund is managed by
the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
