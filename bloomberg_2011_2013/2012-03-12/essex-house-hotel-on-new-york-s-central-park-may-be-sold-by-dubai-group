Dubai Investment Group LLC, a
financial services company owned by the emirate’s ruler, may
sell the  Jumeirah Essex House  hotel on  New York ’s Central Park.  “Current global investor demand for world-class hotel
assets such as Essex House provides a timely opportunity,”
Fadel Al Ali, acting chief executive officer of Dubai Group,
said in an e-mailed statement today. “We constantly review our
portfolio of assets and will pursue asset sales in the right
market conditions.”  Essex House, located on Central Park South between Sixth
and Seventh avenues, was completed in 1931 and taken over by
Dubai Group’s Jumeirah unit in 2006, according to the hotel’s
website. The company completed a $90 million refurbishment on
the 44-story, 509-room property in October 2007.  The Wall Street Journal reported the planned sale earlier,
citing people familiar with the matter. The hotel could be
valued at $375 million to $500 million and it will be marketed
by Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
