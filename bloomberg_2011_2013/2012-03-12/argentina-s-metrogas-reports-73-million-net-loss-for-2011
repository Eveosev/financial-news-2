Argentina ’s natural gas
distribution company  Metrogas SA (METR)  reported a net loss of $73
million in 2011, compared with a $72 million loss in 2010,
according to an e-mailed earnings report from the company.  Fixed distribution tariffs since 1999 and rising costs have
caused “severe economic and financial unbalance,” the company
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
