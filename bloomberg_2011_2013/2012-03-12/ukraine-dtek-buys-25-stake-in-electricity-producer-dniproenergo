DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private
coal and power producer, won a bid to buy a 25 percent stake in
electricity producer  PAT Dniproenergo (DNEN) , its fourth purchase of a
power company since December.  Ukraine’s state property fund sold the stake in
Donetskoblenergo to DTEK for 1.180 billion hryvnia ($147
million), according to a statement on the fund’s website today.
DTEK, owned by the country’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, was
the only bidder, the property fund said. The minimum price was
1.174 billion hryvnia, according to the fund.  DTEK bought 40 percent of power distributor PAT
 Donetskoblenergo (DOON)  and 45 percent of electricity producer PAT
 Zakhidenergo (ZAEN)  in January, and 25 percent of PAT  Kyivenergo (KIEN) , a
state-owned energy generating and distribution company, in
December. Its most recent acquisition was a  coal mine  in the
east of  Ukraine  this month.  Ukraine raised 2.7 billion hryvnia, 27 percent of the
government’s 2012 target for the sale of state assets, in the
first two months of the year, the state property fund  said  on
March 6.  DTEK said last April net income jumped to $359 million in
2010 from $108 million the previous year.  -- Editors: Chris Peterson, Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporters on this story:
