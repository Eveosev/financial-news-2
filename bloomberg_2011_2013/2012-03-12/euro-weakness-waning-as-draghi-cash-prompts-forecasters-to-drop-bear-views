The world’s biggest banks are less
pessimistic about the euro as the  European Central Bank  provides
unlimited cash to the region’s financial system,  Germany  may
avoid recession and Greece looks to complete the biggest
sovereign debt restructuring in history.  Strategists at Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley
raised their estimates for the euro this month, as the median
estimates of more than 50 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg
increased for the second and third quarters. The 17-nation
currency is up about 1.3 percent from an almost 10-year low on
Jan. 16 against nine developed-market peers.  While the crisis that led to bailouts of Greece,  Portugal 
and Ireland and the restructuring of Greek debt caused the euro
to weaken 8.7 percent versus the dollar since August, traders
who predicted a breakup of the single currency are being
silenced. ECB President  Mario Draghi  gave banks more than 1
trillion euros ($1.31 trillion) of three-year loans in December
and February, and German business confidence rose to a seven-
month high.  “We’ve been gradually feeling better about Europe,” David Woo, the global head of rates and currencies at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in New York, said in a telephone interview on
March 2. Draghi’s loans have supported the euro, he said. “That
combined with the fact that the global economic outlook has
improved, including U.S. growth gaining momentum, has made us
less bearish on the euro.”  Euro Gains  Bank of America increased its June 30 call to $1.30 from
$1.25, according to a Feb. 29 note.  The euro depreciated 0.6 percent last week to $1.3123 and
is 8.8 percent higher than the average of about $1.2067 since
its inception in January 1999. It strengthened 0.2 percent to
108.22 yen, taking its year-to-date advance to 8.6 percent
against  Japan ’s currency.  The euro appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.3145 at 1:29 p.m.
 New York  time. It rose 0.1 percent to 108.10 yen.  Draghi cut the ECB’s  benchmark interest rate  twice, to 1
percent, and expanded the central bank’s balance sheet to more
than 3 trillion euros since assuming office Nov. 1, reversing
the strategy of predecessor Jean-Claude Trichet, who oversaw
0.25 percentage-point rate increases in April and July.  ‘Unquestionable Success’  The measures fueled a rally in Europe’s markets as lenders
used cash borrowed under the ECB’s longer-term refinancing
operations, or LTROs, to buy higher-yielding assets.  Italian
two-year note yields  have dropped more than six percentage
points from a euro-era peak 8.12 percent in November, and
similar-maturity Spanish notes have declined more than 3.5
percentage points from 6.12 percent the same month.  Europe ’s benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  has soared 27
percent since last year’s low on Sept. 23, while Germany’s DAX
Index is up 39 percent from its lowest since 2009 on Sept. 12.  The ECB’s three-year loans have been an “unquestionable
success” in unlocking credit markets, Draghi said on March 8,
after policy makers kept their main borrowing rate at 1 percent.
“We are observing a significant inflow, a return of interest,
of confidence in the euro.”  Europe’s common currency jumped 1 percent versus the dollar
on March 8 as a report showed German  industrial output  rose more
than economists forecast in January. German exports increased
2.3 percent in January, a March 9 report from the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden showed. The Munich-based Ifo
institute said on Feb. 23 that its  business climate index 
climbed to 109.6 last month, the highest reading since July.  Predictions of Demise  Predictions of the euro’s demise have waned. “We had a
completely irrational market panic at the end of last year,
where many people were talking about a breakup of the currency
bloc,”  Holger Schmieding , chief economist at Berenberg Bank in
 London , said in a telephone interview on March 9. “Thanks to
the ECB, markets are now returning to a semblance of calm and
the breakup sentiment is diminishing.”  It will probably trade at $1.34 by the end of June,
according to John Normand, London-based head of global currency
strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. lender.  “The ECB’s  balance-sheet expansion  has been overwhelmingly
focused on relieving credit stress, and has had fewer negative
impacts in terms of reducing short-term  interest rates  and
raising inflation expectations,” Normand said in an interview
on March 9. “That’s why the euro is remaining stable.”  Less ‘Aggressive’  Strategists at Morgan Stanley said March 2 they expect the
euro to trade at $1.34 at the end of the quarter, up from a
$1.27 forecast a month earlier. They also boosted their estimate
for Sept. 30 to $1.24 from $1.18.  “We now believe the ECB will not be quite as aggressive
with its policy response and we are not likely to see as deep
rate cuts as we were expecting before,”  Ian Stannard , head of
European foreign-exchange strategy at the bank in London, said
in a telephone interview on March. 6. “It looks as if the need
for the ECB to take further measures has been reduced and that
should allow the euro’s decline to unfold at a slower pace.”  Morgan Stanley now expects a 25 basis-point rate cut this
year, coming in the second quarter, compared with a prior
forecast for a 50 basis-point reduction in 2012. The firm
predicts the euro will slide to $1.19 by year-end.  Its resilience has surprised some of the largest investors
in the more than $4 trillion-a-day market. John Taylor, founder
of currency hedge fund FX Concepts LLC, predicted in January
2011 that the euro would fall to parity, and still says it will
get there eventually, sliding to between $1.15 and $1.18 by May.  ‘Looking Awful’  “The euro has reason to go down now more so than ever,”
he said in a telephone interview on March 9. “This Greek debt
deal does nothing other than show that you could lose a lot of
money investing in those bonds. Spanish bonds are looking awful.
This is just another one of these pauses for the euro. The only
question is how long does that pause last.”  Even as the outlook has improved, forecasters say there are
more declines to come. The euro will end the second quarter at
$1.28 and $1.29 by the conclusion of the third quarter,
Bloomberg surveys of economists show. While both are up by one
cent since February, the euro will be at $1.29 at the end of the
first quarter in 2013, according to another median forecast.  Low rates and the bank loans are prompting traders to sell
the euro to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets. The carry
trade of borrowing in euros to buy the currencies of  Mexico ,
 Brazil , Norway and  Australia  returned about 31 percent on an
annualized basis from the day before the ECB’s second three-year
LTRO on Feb. 29 through March 9. The strategy was little changed
in 2011.  Growth Forecasts  The euro-area economy may contract by 0.4 percent this
year, with recessions in countries including  Greece  and Italy.
Germany will probably grow by 0.6 percent, and 1.5 percent in
2013, according to median predictions of economists in Bloomberg
surveys. U.S. gross domestic product will expand by 2.2 percent
this year and by 2.5 percent in 2013, surveys show.  “If you look at which economy is relatively stronger, it
would have to be the U.S.,”  Frances Hudson , who helps manage
about $237 billion as a global strategist in Edinburgh at
Standard Life Investments, Scotland’s second-biggest biggest
money manager, said in a March 6 telephone interview. “We are
very heavy the dollar and light the euro.”  U.S. employers boosted payrolls by 227,000 in February,
while the  unemployment rate  stayed at 8.3 percent, the Labor
Department said March 9. Job growth over the last six months was
the strongest since 2006.  Fed’s Pledge  The euro’s advance contrasts with the dollar’s decline
after $2.3 trillion in debt purchases by the  Federal Reserve 
from 2008 to June 2011. The IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s
 Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks the U.S. currency against those of
six trading partners, is down 11 percent to 79.959 from 89.624
in March 2009, its peak since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in September 2008.  A Fed pledge to keep rates at about zero through 2014 is
weakening the dollar the most of any major currency this year
except the yen.  “The Fed’s strong commitment to very easy policy until
2014, that’s certainly a factor that’s bearish for the dollar,”
 Steven Saywell , head of foreign-exchange strategy for Europe in
London at BNP Paribas SA, said in a telephone interview on March
8. BNP Paribas forecasts the euro will end the third quarter at
$1.40.  Hedge funds and other large speculators have reduced wagers
that the common currency will slide. The so-called net short
position was 116,473 contracts as of March 6, from 171,347 in
January, statistics from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission show.  ‘Doomsday Scenario’  Draghi’s actions have reduced a measure of European banks’
reluctance to lend. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference
between the euro interbank offered rate and overnight indexed
swaps, was 54.7 basis points at the end of last week, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s down from 101 basis points in
December, the most since the sovereign crisis began.  “The expectation of a doomsday scenario in the euro region
has passed,” Pierre Lequeux, head of currency management in
London at Aviva Investors, which manages about $424 billion,
said in a telephone interview on March 6. “The ECB has been
fantastic, liquidity is on tap for banks and that’s a good thing
for confidence. The global scenario is also a bit less gloomy
than it was six months ago. There are reasons to be positive on
the euro.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
