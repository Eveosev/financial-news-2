Serbia’s foreign-currency reserves
fell for a second month in February as investors moved away from
government debt and the central bank sold euros to bolster the
dinar.  Foreign-exchange reserves dropped to 11.2 billion euros
($14.7 billion) from 11.6 billion euros in January, the
Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said in an e-mail today.
Total foreign-exchange reserves stood at 12 billion euros at the
end of 2011.  The reserves fell as investors withdrew 204.2 million euros
from  government securities  that matured in February, while it
spent 188.5 million euros to slow declines in the dinar, which
depreciated by 5 percent since the start of 2012.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , fell to 6.35 billion euros from 6.7 billion in January.
This equaled 429 percent of M1 money supply, down from 447
percent in the previous month and remained sufficient for more
than seven months of imports,’’ according to the central bank.
Last month’s reserves were sufficient to finance eight months of
imports.  Interbank trading volumes of around 1.7 billion euros in
February, were 128 million euros lower than in January, the bank
said. Two-month interbank trading volumes stood at 3.5 billion
euros, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
