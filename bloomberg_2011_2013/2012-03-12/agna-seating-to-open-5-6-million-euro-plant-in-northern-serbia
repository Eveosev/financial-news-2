Magna Seating, a unit of  Magna
International Inc. (MG/A) ,  Canada ’s biggest auto-parts supplier, plans
to open a factory producing car-seat covers in northern  Serbia ,
the country’s investment promotion agency said.  The 3,200 square-meter (34,400 square feet) plant will
employ 132 people initially, which will increase to 444 by 2015,
Aleksandar Miloradovic, a spokesman for  Serbia Investment and
Export Promotion Agency  said in a phone interview.  The plant’s construction may begin in the second quarter
and it is estimated to cost around 2.86 million euros ($3.75
million), while the total investment is seen at 5.64 million
euros, he said.  It will be located in Odzaci, 140 kilometers (90 miles)
northwest of Belgrade, where local authorities will provide a
2.68-hectare (6.6-acre) lot to Magna, as part of efforts to
attract foreign direct investments, Miloradovic said. The
investor may also receive government incentives that range from
4,000 euros to 10,000 euros per job created, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
