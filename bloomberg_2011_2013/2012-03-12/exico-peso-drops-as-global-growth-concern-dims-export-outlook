Mexico ’s peso declined for the
first time in four days after slower-than-forecast Chinese
export growth boosted concern about the world economy and the
global appetite for goods from the Latin American country.  The peso declined 0.3 percent to 12.6844 per  U.S. dollar  at
1:48 p.m. in Mexico City, from 12.6425 on March 9. It’s risen
9.9 percent this year, the most among major currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  China reported the biggest trade deficit in at least 22
years on March 10, damping confidence in global economic growth
that had been spurred by higher-than-forecast U.S. jobs data
last week. The peso is slumping as the Chinese data adds to
concern about the  U.S. economy , the destination for 80 percent
of Mexican exports, according to Pedro Tuesta, a Washington-
based Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc.  “This is not a compartmentalized thing,” Tuesta said by
phone. “Mexico is very exposed to trade. Mexico’s market grows
because the external market grows.”  Latin America’s second-biggest economy may expand closer to
4 percent this year, rather than the 3.5 percent the government
has forecast, should the U.S. economy keep improving, central
bank Governor Agustin Carstens said last month in Mexico City  The yield on the country’s peso-denominated debt due in
2024 was little changed at 6.38 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.02 centavo to 131.56
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
