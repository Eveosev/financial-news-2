The euro-Norwegian krone exchange
has potential for “further weakness” to 7.2165 per euro, the
2003 record,  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  said in a weekly technical update.  “Since late January the market has continued to weaken,
hitting both our objectives at 7.4880 and 7.4330,” the
Copenhagen-based lender said in a report. “The fresh multiyear
low currently lies at 7.3925 on March 5. Despite these levels
being reached, the medium- to longer-term outlook remains
negative and there is a risk the market could possibly even
accelerate on the downside as the phase matures.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
