Duke Street Capital Ltd., the
British private equity firm that shelved plans to raise a new
fund, is considering a sale of its French medical-testing
company Biomnis.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  was appointed to evaluate options
for Biomnis, including a sale, according to a spokesman for Duke
Street, who declined to be named to comply with company policy.  Biomnis, based in Lyon, may be valued at between 300
million euros and 400 million euros ($525 million), according to
two people with knowledge of the deliberations.  The potential auction is set to start next month, said one
person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
private. Bidders may include  3i Group Plc (III) , the largest publicly
traded British buyout firm, and  France ’s PAI Partners two other
people said.  Biomnis processes more than 10 million tests annually for
clients in 40 countries, according to information available on
its website. Duke Street acquired it in 2008 for 217 million
euros.  Biomnis posted about 241 million euros in sales last year
and has more than 1,700 employees, Duke Street’s  website  said.  Duke Street, which manages a 963 million-euro buyout fund
raised in 2007, is seeking to return cash to its investors after
shelving plans to raise an 850 million euro fund amid a
difficult financing environment, one person said.  A spokeswoman for 3i declined to comment, and a spokesman
for PAI couldn’t immediately comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
