Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , ranked eighth
among advisers on U.S. stock offerings last year, hired Jeffrey Bunzel from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  to run its equity  capital
markets  business for the Americas.  Bunzel will start as managing director in  New York  in
September, Deutsche Bank said in a statement today. Bunzel ran
the same business at Credit Suisse, according to the statement.  Bunzel, who was at Credit Suisse for 18 years, will help
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank expand its equities business in
the Americas, Mark Hantho, co-head of global equity capital
markets, said in the statement. Zurich-based Credit Suisse
ranked fifth in market share for U.S. equity offerings in 2011,
up from seventh in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Jeff brings a wealth of experience to the platform,”
said Hantho, to whom Bunzel will report directly. “We’re
confident that his expertise will further enhance our growth in
this key market.”  Bunzel will replace Michael Friezo, who is leaving the
firm, Deutsche Bank spokesman  John Gallagher  said in a phone
interview today. He declined to provide further details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
