German bonds advanced, sending
yields down to the lowest in almost four months, on concern
 Greece ’s finances will worsen even as regional leaders prepare
to sign off on the nation’s second bailout.  Ten-year bunds rose for a second day as a government report
showed wholesale-price inflation eased last month, helping to
preserve the value of the fixed payments. Ministers from the 17-
nation currency bloc will meet in Brussels today after investors
agreed last week to take a loss on their Greek debt. The cost of
insuring against default on the region’s bonds rose to the
highest in eight weeks after the declaration of a credit event
triggering $3.2 billion of Greek debt protection contracts.  “People are trying to digest what the implications are of
the Greek  credit event  and looking at the Eurogroup meeting”
and that is supporting bunds, said  Marc Ostwald , a strategist at
Monument Securities Ltd. in  London . “Greece was never going to
go far from the market’s attention. There’s a little bit of
caution creeping in, but it’s caution rather than negativity.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yield fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.76 percent at 4:09 p.m. London time,
after dropping to 1.74 percent, the least since Nov. 15. The 2
percent bond due January 2022 climbed 0.345, or 3.45 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,312) face amount, to 102.175.  Euro-area ministers will finalize the accord to give Greece
a 130 billion-euro aid package, the nation’s second. They’ll
also focus on  Spain ’s budget-cutting efforts and  Portugal ’s aid
program.  EFSF Bonds  European Financial Stability Facility notes due March 2013
that will be issued to holders of Greek  government bonds  as part
of the nation’s debt swap may yield about 0.58 percent,
Bloomberg data show. The securities were bid at 99.761 cents on
the euro, Commerzbank AG prices showed. They were offered at
99.84 cents, also according to Commerzbank. The bid yield was
0.65 percent and the offer was 0.56 percent.  Greek government bonds due in February 2023 were bid at
27.75 cents on the euro, to yield 18.49 percent, Commerzbank
data showed. They were offered at 29 cents, according to BNP
Paribas prices. That’s a yield of 17.88 percent.  Germany  sold 3.493 billion euros of six-month bills at a
yield that was lower than at the previous auction. Italian bonds
dropped as the nation entered its fourth recession since 2001.
The euro weakened 0.3 percent against the yen to 107.95.  CDS Payouts  Portuguese  10-year bonds  rose for a fourth day after the
International Swaps & Derivatives Association said last week
Greece’s use of collective action clauses forcing investors to
take losses under its debt restructuring triggered payouts on
the credit-default-swap insurance.  The decision gives investors holding the bonds of nations
such as Portugal confidence that any protection they take out to
guard against the risk of default will be honored in case the
countries are forced into a situation similar to Greece.  “It was always likely that CDS would trigger,” said
 Elisabeth Afseth , a strategist at Investec Bank Plc in London.
“Confirmation may be giving a bit of confidence that CDS is
still useful as a hedge.”  The yield on Portugal’s 10-year bonds declined 20 basis
points to 13.65 percent.  Volatility in Portuguese government debt was the second
highest in euro-area markets today, behind Greek securities,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield
spreads and credit-default swaps.  Italian Contraction  Italian bonds fell for a second day after a government
report showed the economy shrank for a second quarter,
confirming a preliminary estimate from February.  Gross domestic product declined 0.7 percent in the last
three months of 2011 from the previous quarter, the national
statistics institute said in  Rome .  Ten-year  yields  climbed six basis points to 4.90 percent,
after rising three basis points on March 9. The yield is down
from a euro-era record of 7.48 percent on Nov. 9.  German wholesale prices increased 2.6 percent in February
from a year earlier after rising 3 percent in the previous
month, the Federal Statistics Office said today.  Germany sold bills due Sept. 12 at an average yield of
0.053 percent, down from 0.076 percent at the previous auction.
Investors bid for 1.6 times the securities offered, compared
with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 1.5 on Feb. 13.  Bill Auction  France sold 8 billion euros of 84-, 175- and 357-day bills
today.  Belgian two-year notes rose after policy makers approved an
additional 2.5 billion euros in austerity measures to bring the
 budget deficit  within the European Union limit as economic
growth slows. Two-year yields declined two basis points to 0.98
percent.  Italian 10-year bond futures may weaken toward 103.69
should they break below a key support level, according to UBS
AG, citing trading patterns.  The contracts “are vulnerable while they trade below
107.80, the high from March 9,”  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-
income technical strategy in London, wrote in a note to clients.  A break of 105.68, the mid-point of last week’s rally,
“opens the door back to 103.69.” That level represents the 38
percent Fibonacci retracement of the February recovery, he
wrote. The contract expiring in June fell to 106.05, after
falling to as low as 105.74.  Support refers to an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate orders to buy a security to be grouped. Fibonacci
analysis is based on the theory that prices rise or fall by
certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  German bunds have returned 0.3 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italian bonds have earned 13
percent, the data show, with U.S. Treasuries losing 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
