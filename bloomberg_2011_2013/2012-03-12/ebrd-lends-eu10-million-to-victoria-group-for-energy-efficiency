The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development will lend 10 million euros ($13.1
$million) to  Serbia ’s Victoria Group to start using biomass fuel
at its oilseed crushing units.  The loan will provide biomass-fired boilers at  Sojaprotein
AD (SJPT) , the biggest soy bean processor in the Balkans, and at
 Victoria Oil  that makes cooking oil, the London-based lender
said in an e-mailed statement.  “The project will help  Victoria Group  cut its consumption
of fossil fuels by 20,000 tons per year, which will result in a
substantial cost saving of 5.8 million euros,” the EBRD said.
The boilers will also reduce the company’s carbon footprint by
an estimated of 58,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually, it said.  This project is part of the EBRD’s 50 million-euro
Agribusiness Sustainable Investment Facility, or ASIF, launched
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
