Former New York Mets outfielder
Jason Pridie was suspended for 50 games after a second violation
of minor league baseball’s drug rules.  The 28-year-old player, now in the  Oakland Athletics ’
organization, failed a test for a recreational drug and will be
banned effective at the start of the season, according to a
statement today from the office of Major League Baseball
Commissioner  Bud Selig . The substance, classified as a “drug of
abuse” rather than a performance-enhancer, wasn’t identified in
the news release.  Pridie played in 101 games for the Mets last year, hitting
.231 with four home runs and 28 runs scored. He is on the roster
of the  Sacramento River Cats  of the Pacific Coast League, a
Triple-A affiliate of the Athletics, according to MLB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
