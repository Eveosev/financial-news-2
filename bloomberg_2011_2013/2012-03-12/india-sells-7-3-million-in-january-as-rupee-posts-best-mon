India ’s central bank sold $7.3
million of foreign currency in January, official data showed, as
the rupee posted its biggest monthly gain on record.  The  Reserve Bank  of India sold a total $12.52 billion last
year, according to a report  published  on its website today, as
the rupee weakened 16 percent against the  U.S. dollar . The local
currency strengthened 7.3 percent in January, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, the largest jump since at least February
1973. Central banks intervene in currency markets by arranging
purchases or sales of foreign exchange.  The rupee, Asia’s worst performing currency last year, is
the region’s biggest gainer in 2012 with a 6.2 percent
appreciation after the central bank and government took steps to
curb speculation and volatility in the foreign-exchange market
and attract investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
