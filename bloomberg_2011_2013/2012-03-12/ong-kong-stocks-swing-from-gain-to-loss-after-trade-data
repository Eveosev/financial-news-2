Most  Hong Kong stocks  fell after
 China ’s central bank governor said recent cuts to reserve ratios
didn’t signal a change in monetary policy even as the country
reported its biggest trade deficit in 22 years.  Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038) , a maker of mobile
phones that depends on Europe for a quarter of its operating
profit, dropped 3.6 percent after China’s export growth slowed
amid the euro region’s debt crisis. China Railway Construction
Corp. plunged 7.3 percent after the Xinhua News Agency said a
section of high-speed track built by the company collapsed in
heavy rain. China Mobile Ltd. rose 3.9 percent after brokerages
recommended shares of the carrier.  “China’s government needs to do something to beef up the
economy,” said  Alex Au , Hong Kong-based managing director of
Richland Capital Management Ltd., which oversees $300 million.
“Investors will start to expect more from the government.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.2 percent to close at
21,134.18, erasing losses in the last 15 minutes of trading.
Trading volume on the gauge was 35 percent less than its 30-day
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About two
stocks declined for each that rose on the broader  Hang Seng 
Composite Index.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies,
also known as the H-share index, dropped 0.3 percent to
11,225.91.  The Hang Seng Index has risen 14 percent this year,
boosting the price of shares on the gauge to 10.7 times
estimated earnings. That compares with 13.1 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11 times for the Stoxx  Europe 
600 Index.  Zhou Xiaochuan  Futures on the Hang Seng expiring this month gained 0.3
percent to 21,124. The HSI Volatility Index slumped 1.1 percent
to 21.14, indicating options traders expect a swing of 6.1
percent in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  Stocks slipped today after People’s Bank of China Governor
 Zhou Xiaochuan  said last month’s cut in the reserve-requirement
ratio isn’t a signal of loosening monetary policy. The central
bank in February lowered the amount of money mainland banks have
to keep in reserve for only the second time since 2008.  China on March 10 reported its largest trade deficit since
at least 1989 last month as Europe’s sovereign-debt turmoil
damped exports and imports rebounded after a weeklong lunar New
Year holiday.  Track Collapse  Foxconn International, which makes handsets for Nokia OYJ,
slumped 3.6 percent to HK$5.59.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , which exports
toys and clothes to U.S.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., fell 1.5
percent to HK$17.50.  China Railway Construction led railroad stocks lower after
Xinhua News said a 300-meter (1,000-foot) section of track built
by the company collapsed in central China’s Hubei province
following heavy rains. The company, builder of more than half
the country’s routes, plunged 7.3 percent to HK$5.31, dropping
the most this year.  China Railway Group Ltd. (601390)  fell 5.4 percent to HK$2.83 on
speculation the incident may deter the government from pushing
ahead with a 2.8 trillion yuan ($443 billion) building plan.
Construction was slowed last year after 40 people were killed in
a high-speed crash near Wenzhou in July.  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s biggest phone carrier by
users, gained 3.9 percent to HK$87.45 after Credit Suisse Group
AG and HSBC Holdings Plc recommended buying the shares. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. last week boosted the company’s price target to
HK$95 from HK$84, citing an improving smartphone business, high
dividends and development of a fourth-generation network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
