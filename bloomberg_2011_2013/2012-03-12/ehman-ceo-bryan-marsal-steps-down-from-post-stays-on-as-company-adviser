Bryan Marsal, who has run  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  since it filed the biggest bankruptcy in
U.S. history in 2008, resigned as chief executive officer and
was replaced by John Suckow, the president.  Marsal, co-founder of restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal
Inc., has billed Lehman hourly for the firm’s work on
liquidating Lehman, charging $512 million in fees since 2008. He
will continue in the role of senior adviser to the parent
company, Lehman said in a regulatory filing today.  Lehman, which has spent almost $1.6 billion on fees to
managers and advisers, will make its first payment to creditors
on April 17.  Lehman’s bankruptcy became America’s most costly in April
2010, when it surpassed the $757 million cost of  Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) ’s
three-year liquidation, according to data assembled by
bankruptcy professor  Lynn LoPucki  at the University of
California,  Los Angeles . The failed energy trader’s investors
were paid 53 cents on the dollar, while Lehman’s $65 billion
liquidation plan would give the average creditor less than 18
cents, according to court documents.  Lehman’s creditors range from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and
hedge funds to the New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, as well as individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Once
the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank, Lehman filed for
bankruptcy with assets of $639 billion.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
