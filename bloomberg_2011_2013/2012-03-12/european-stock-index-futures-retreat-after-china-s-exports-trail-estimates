European (SXXP)  stocks retreated, halting
a three-day rally for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index, as a report
showed export in China, the world’s second-largest economy, grew
at a slower pace than forecast.  Mining companies fell with metal prices.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN) 
dropped 4.9 percent after the company terminated merger talks
with  Misys Plc. (MSY)   Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  sank 5
percent after its biggest investor reached an agreement with
banks that hold part of its stake as collateral on a loan.  The Stoxx 600 fell 0.2 percent to 264.87 at the close. The
benchmark measure has still  rallied 8.3 percent  so far this year
as the  European (SXXP)  Central Bank disbursed 1 trillion euros ($1.3
trillion) of loans to the euro area’s banks and U.S. economic
reports beat estimates. The gauge rallied at the end of last
week, trimming its weekly drop to 0.7 percent, as a release
showed that the  U.S. economy  added more jobs than predicted and
 Greece ’s private creditors agreed to a debt swap.  “ China  really is the only potential negative out there,”
said Steve Goldman, managing director at Kapstream Capital in
Sydney which manages about $3.2 billion in assets on Bloomberg
Television. “We’ve seen a good start to the year and there is a
lot less risk to the global economy than there was three, four,
five months ago.”  China reported its  biggest trade deficit  last month since
at least 1989, adding to last week’s releases on factory output
and retail sales that signaled slowing growth.  Finance Ministers’ Meeting  Finance ministers from the 17 nations that use the euro
gathered in Brussels today to approve the 130 billion-euro
second bailout package for Greece. Bondholders last week agreed
to exchange the country’s privately held debt for new
securities.  National benchmark indexes declined in 11 of the 18
western-European markets.  Germany ’s DAX Index added 0.3 percent.
The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index and  France ’s CAC 40 Index increased
0.1 percent. Gauges in  Italy ,  Spain ,  Portugal , Ireland and
Greece fell.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  dropped 3.7 percent to 1,369 pence as
copper snapped a three-day rally on the London Metal Exchange
following signals that  China’s economy  has slowed. France’s
 Eramet (ERA)  SA lost 4.1 percent to 107.30 euros, while Rio Tinto
Group fell 1.7 percent to 3,450.5 pence.  Temenos, Misys Fall  Temenos dropped 4.9 percent to 15.40 Swiss francs and Misys
lost 3.8 percent to 328 pence after the Geneva-based software
maker terminated merger talks after failing to reach an
agreement on a deal.  Temenos won more time from the U.K. Takeover Panel last
week to respond to competing bids for Misys after ValueAct
Capital,  Misys’s largest shareholder , joined forces with buyout
firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd. to work on an offer. Vista Equity
Partners is considering a separate bid.  Monte Paschi sank 5 percent to 38.1 euro cents after
 Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena  reached an agreement with
the banks that hold part of its stake.  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported that the foundation has held talks
to sell about 7 percent of Monte Paschi to families and
entrepreneurs close to the bank. The newspaper didn’t say how it
obtained the information. The foundation planned to sell a
further 8 percent to private-equity firms, Il Sole 24 Ore said.  Davide Campari-Milano SpA (CPR)  plunged 5.8 percent to 5.35 euros
after the maker of Wild Turkey bourbon reported full-year net
income of 159.2 million euros, missing the  average analyst
estimate  of 172.3 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company said it was “cautiously optimistic” for
2012.  Accor, Banco Sabadell  Accor SA (AC)  climbed 2.2 percent to 26.89 euros. Credit Suisse
Group AG raised its recommendation for Europe’s biggest hotel
company to outperform from neutral.  Banco Sabadell SA surged 7.4 percent to 2.31 euros in
 Madrid , its biggest advance since November and the largest gain
on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)   today. Spanish brokerage, N+1 Equities
upgraded the lender to a “strong” buy, saying its acquisition
of Banco CAM was a “game-changing move.” Analyst Francisco Riquel said Sabadell was now the “best positioned bank in
Spain.”  According to  Data Explorers figures  on Bloomberg, 7.1
percent of Sabadell’s shares were out on loan on March 7. It
would take 21 days of average volume to buy back those shares,
Bloomberg estimates show. Short selling is when traders borrow
shares and sell them with the intention of repurchasing the
securities at a lower price, enabling them to pocket the
difference.  Cobham Plc (COB)  gained 4.8 percent to 220.6 pence after the
world’s largest maker of airborne-refueling equipment ended its
pursuit of Thrane & Thrane A/S after the company rebuffed a 273
million-pound ($427 million) proposal.  Pirelli & C. SpA,  Europe’s third-largest tiremaker , surged
7.2 percent to 8.39 euros, its highest price since December
2007. The company posted 2011 profit of 451.6 million euros,
exceeding the 314.3 million-euro analyst estimate, and increased
 its dividend  to 27 euro cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
