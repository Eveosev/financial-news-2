The People’s Bank of  China  said
today it will manage the country’s foreign-exchange  reserves 
with “new ideas” and in a more effective manner.  The central bank commented in a statement ahead of a
briefing by Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  in Beijing. The nation had
$3.18 trillion of reserves as of December, the largest in the
world.  The statement adds to previous signals by China’s
government that it wants to diversify the holdings away from U.S.
dollar-denominated assets. The country reduced its holdings of
U.S. government securities last year to $1.15 trillion from
$1.16 trillion, the first cut since the U.S. Treasury Department
began compiling the data in 2001. China doesn’t publicly
disclose a breakdown of its reserves.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  said last month that the nation is
willing to get “more deeply” involved in resolving  Europe ’s debt
crisis, although the continent must send a clearer message to
show how it’s working to strengthen its finances.  The central bank also said in the statement that it will
maintain a prudent monetary policy while fine-tuning and taking
preemptive measures as appropriate.  Zhou speaks today at 10 a.m. local time in a press
conference as part of the annual gathering of the country’s
legislature.  --Nerys Avery, Li Yanping. With assistance from Zheng Lifei in
