Mongolian Mining Corp. (975) , a producer
of coking coal, signed loan agreements for as much as $300
million with lenders including  Standard Bank  Group Ltd.,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The three-year loan will allow the company to partially
refinance its existing debt and extend the maturity of other
funding facilities, according to a March 9 statement to the Hong
Kong stock exchange.  The loan will be in default if, among other things, MCS
Holding LLC, an indirect controlling shareholder of the company,
ceases to hold at least 30 percent of the issued share capital
of the company without the prior written consent of all lenders,
according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
