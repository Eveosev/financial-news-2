The lira retreated for a third day
and headed for the lowest level in more than six weeks.  The lira depreciated 0.2 percent to 1.7910 per dollar as of
9:37 a.m. in Istanbul, its weakest level since Jan. 26 on a
closing basis, paring its year-to-date appreciation to 5.6
percent.  The central bank will release  current-account figures  at
10.00 in Ankara.  Turkey â€™s deficit probably narrowed on an annual
basis for the third consecutive month in January. The deficit in
the month was $5.5 billion, according to the median estimate of
six economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
