Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  advanced 0.3
percent to 2,292.12 at the close in Warsaw, extending this
year’s gain to 6.9 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Distribution Corp. (CDC)   rose as much as
4.2 percent to 14.55 zloty and closed 0.3 percent higher at 14
zloty after Russian Standard Group amended an offer to raise its
stake in Poland’s second-largest vodka producer.  Cyfrowy Polsat SA (CPS)   gained 0.4 percent to 13.7
zloty, climbing for a second day, after Poland’s biggest
television network reported fourth-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates.  PBG SA (PBG)  , Poland’s third-largest construction
company, sank 6.5 percent to 48.7 zloty, the lowest since July
2005, on investor concern about its plans to increase capital

of convertible bonds, the company said on March 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
