NewLead Holdings Ltd. (NEWL) , which
operates a fleet of oil-product tankers and dry-bulk commodity
ships, reduced its debt by $159 million with the completion of
the sale of five vessels.  Four product tankers were sold for $147.9 million, the
Piraeus, Greece-based company said today in a statement. A dry-
bulk vessel, the Newlead Esmeralda, was sold for $12 million,
with $11.1 million applied to lowering debt, it said. All the
ships were sold as part of a reorganization plan, Chief
Executive Officer Michael Zolotas said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
