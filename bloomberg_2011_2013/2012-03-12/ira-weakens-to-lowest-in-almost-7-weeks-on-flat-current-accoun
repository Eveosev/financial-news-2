The lira retreated for a second
day, heading for its lowest level in almost seven weeks, after
current-account deficit for January remained unchanged over a
year ago, missing estimates.  The lira depreciated 0.6 percent to 1.7977 per dollar as of
5:01 p.m. in Istanbul, the weakest level since Jan. 25 on a
closing basis, paring year-to-date gains to 5.2 percent.  Yields (BENCH) 
on the two-year benchmark debt climbed 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 9.32 percent, according to a  Turk Ekonomi
Bankasi AS (TEBNK)  index of the securities showed.  The  deficit  was $6 billion, the central bank in Ankara said
today, lagging the $5.5-billion median estimate of six
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Turkey’s current-account gap
is the highest in the world at 10.3 percent of the gross
domestic product among 60 major economies tracked by the
 International Monetary Fund . The lira fell 18 percent last year
to its record low against the dollar in the biggest decline
worldwide as the country’s deficit widened and inflation surged
to a three-year high of 10.5 percent.  The gap “underscores Turkey’s vulnerability via the energy
price channel,” Tim Ash, London-based head of emerging markets
research at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, said in a report to
clients e-mailed today.  Turkey  paid $54 billion for energy
imports last year, which is 22 percent of its total import bill,
according to the statistics office  website .  Crude for April delivery increased to $109.77 per barrel on
Feb. 24, the most since May, on account of rising geo-political
tensions in the  Middle East . The commodity has since retreated,
trading $106.18 per barrel in electronic trading in  New York 
today, down 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
