Azerbaijan , which shares a 756-
kilometer (470-mile) border with  Iran , vowed to prevent the use
of its territory to carry out attacks against its southern
neighbor, President  Ilham Aliyev ’s aide said.  “Can we allow ourselves to bomb Iran or allow anyone to
carry our air strikes against Iran?” Ali Hasanov, head of the
social and political department of the presidential office, said
in remarks broadcast on the private ANS television channel.
“It’s absolutely impossible because our brothers live there.”  Azeri officials also sought to ease Iranian concerns about
plans to buy Israeli drones and missile-defense systems valued
at $1.6 billion, with Hasanov saying the weapons are intended to
strengthen the former Soviet republic’s defense capability
because of its ongoing conflict with  Armenia  over the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region.  Defense Minister Safar Abiyev reiterated Azerbaijan won’t
be used to stage attacks against Iran at a meeting with his
Iranian counterpart, Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi, in Tehran
today, state-run Press TV reported.  Almost a quarter of Iran’s 75 million people are ethnic
Azeri, while the Persian Gulf state’s Shiite religion is shared
by two-thirds of Azerbaijan’s 9-million population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
