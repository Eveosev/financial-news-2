Qatar Petroleum , the Persian Gulf
country’s state-run energy company, based its budget for this
year on an oil price of $65 a barrel, according to Finance
Minister Yousef Kamal.  The cabinet hasn’t yet decided on an oil price for the
2012-2013 fiscal year budget, which is to be released by June,
Kamal said at a conference in Doha, the nation’s capital.  Oil and gas exports account for about half of Qatar’s gross
domestic product, according to the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency’s World Factbook. The country, the biggest exporter of
liquefied natural gas, was the world’s fastest-growing economy
for the past two years, International Monetary Fund  data  showed.  Crude averaged $95.11 a barrel over the past year on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . The country based its budget for
the year ending this month on a price of $55 a barrel.  The next budget will be bigger than the current one, Kamal
said today, without giving details. It’s release was delayed
from early April because of accounting changes. The government
seeks to keep inflation at 3.5 percent by issuing bonds and
treasury bills, Kamal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
