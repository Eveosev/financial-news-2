The value of  France ’s farm and food
exports, the world’s fifth-biggest, jumped 8.4 percent in
January on U.S. and Asian demand for wine and cognac.  Exports of farm products and food rose to 4.43 billion
euros ($5.8 billion) from 4.08 billion euros a year earlier, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said in an online  report  today.  France is the European Union’s largest farm producer and in
the 27-nation bloc trails the Netherlands and  Germany  in the
value of agricultural exports, World Trade Organization data
show. Farm products and food contributed a 757 million-euro
surplus to France’s current account in January.  “Wine and cognac continue to drive the exports,” the
ministry wrote. “The increase in exports of wine, champagne and
alcohols is picking up after the slight decline in December.”  Beverage shipments rose to 828 million euros from 725
million euros in January 2011, the ministry reported. French
makers of wine and cognac include LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA and Pernod Ricard SA.  Exports of bovines rose to 130 million euros from 113
million euros, lifted by demand from  Turkey , according to the
ministry. Cereal shipments fell to 555 million euros from 576
million euros as Morocco and  Egypt  bought less wheat, it said.  The country imported 3.67 billion euros of agricultural
goods and food in the month, compared with 3.42 billion euros in
January 2011, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
