Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA) , the owner
of Colombia’s biggest airline, rose for a third day after the
company proposed what would be its first dividend payment since
the stock’s May trading debut.  The preferred shares jumped 1.4 percent to 4,310 pesos at
11:47 a.m. in Bogota. The stock has advanced 6.6 percent in the
past three days, the steepest three-day gain since Feb. 14.  The company’s board of directors proposed a dividend
payment of 50 pesos per share to be paid after April 27. The
dividend payment will be considered at a shareholders meeting on
March 30, according to a  statement  posted on the website of
Colombia’s financial regulator on March 7.  “It’s a small yield, but more important than the amount
that they’ll put out is the fact that the company is affirming
that it already has the capacity to distribute dividends,” said
Santiago Melo, an analyst at Alianza Valores SA. “Investors
weren’t expecting it,” he said.  The company said on March 8 that 2011 profit rose 221
percent from a year ago to 202 billion pesos ($114 million).
Shares have gained 31 percent since the start of the year after
tumbling 32 percent in the fourth quarter, the worst performance
among stocks in  Colombia ’s benchmark index.  “The stock has been pretty strong lately, and this is an
additional factor that helps reaffirm confidence for investors
in the company,” Melo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
