Peru ’s sol held near a 15-year high
after companies bought the currency to pay local income taxes
before a deadline next month.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6695 per dollar at today’s
close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. It earlier
touched 2.6670, the strongest level since 1997, data from Peru’s
financial regulator show.  “We’re expecting more sol buying for the payment of
taxes,” said Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco Internacional del
Peru in Lima. “Flows haven’t been that big today but possibly
tomorrow or in the coming days and weeks” demand will grow, he
said.  The central bank has  bought  $4.6 billion in the  spot market 
this year, including $121 million today, to stem gains in the
sol as companies with dollar-denominated revenue bought the
currency to pay taxes.  Peru’s  trade  surplus widened in January on rising exports
of copper, gold and fishmeal, the national statistics agency
said today. The country posted a trade surplus of $739 million,
compared with $350 million a year ago, as exports climbed 32
percent to $3.93 billion.  Imports rose 22 percent to $3.19 billion, which reflects
the strength of the local currency, Celfin Capital said in an e-
mailed report.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.40 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The security’s price rose 0.26 centimo to 116.30
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
