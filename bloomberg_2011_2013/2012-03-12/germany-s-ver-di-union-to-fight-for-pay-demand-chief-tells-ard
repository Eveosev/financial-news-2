Germany ’s Ver.di union is ready to
fight for a pay increase of 6.5 percent for federal and
municipal workers as it resumes talks today with employers,
Chairman Frank Bsirske told  ARD Television .  “We seek a clear, sustainable and real improvement,”
Bsirske said. The union, representing about 2 million municipal
and federal workers, will hold second-round pay talks beginning
today in Potsdam near Berlin.  Bsirske said his union’s pay claim would, if agreed, help
bolster domestic demand as exports weaken in the debt crisis.
The union has staged warning strikes in regions across the
country since first-round pay talks began March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
