Canadian farmers may pay more for
fuel and fertilizer this year, compared with 2011, as emerging
economies boost energy consumption and supply growth slows, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  Fuel costs for farm machinery may rise about 3 percent in
2012, compared with 2011, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada said
today in an e-mailed report. Energy costs, mainly for diesel and
gasoline, jumped 25 percent in 2011, according to the report.
Fertilizer prices may climb 5 percent in 2012, after surging 29
percent in 2011, the Ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
