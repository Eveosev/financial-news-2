Mozambique ’s central bank cut its
benchmark  interest rate  for the second time in four months to
boost economic growth as the inflation rate fell to the lowest
in more than two years.  The standing lending facility rate was reduced by 1.25
percentage points to 13.75 percent, the Maputo-based Bank of
Mozambique said in an e-mailed statement today. The bank lowered
the lending rate 100 basis points in December. The standing
deposit rate was cut to 3.5 percent from 5 percent.  Inflation in the southern African nation slowed to 3.5
percent in February, the lowest level since December 2009, as
the currency’s gains helped to curb price pressures. The central
bank reduced borrowing costs last year to help support economic
growth as the debt crisis in  Europe  undermines the global
recovery.  Mozambique’s economy expanded 6.7 percent in the third
quarter from a year ago, the statistics agency said on Dec. 28.
Mozambique’s metical gained 18 percent against the dollar since
the start of last year, the second-best performing currency in
the world of more than 160 tracked by Bloomberg.  The central bank will “cautiously” ease monetary policy,
the government said in a letter posted on the International
Monetary Fund’s website on Dec. 9. GDP will grow about 8 percent
annually in the “medium term,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
