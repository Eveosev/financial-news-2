Trading (MVOLUSE)  on American equity
exchanges fell to the lowest level of the year today as
enthusiasm waned among investors even after the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rallied 25 percent in five months.  Shares changing hands on  all exchanges  fell 16 percent to
5.23 billion today from March 9, while  S&P 500   composite volume 
slipped 17 percent to 2.17 billion shares, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Those are the lowest daily levels excluding
holiday weeks since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 2008.  A rally that has restored more than  $3.2 trillion  into U.S.
equities has failed to lure investors following one of the most
volatile years on record. While the S&P 500 reached its highest
level since June 2008 on March 1 and has had its best annual
start since 1998, individuals are shunning equities after they
were burned in 2011 by Europe’s debt crisis, according to  Mark Turner , head of U.S. sales trading at Instinet Inc. in  New York .  “I don’t think investors are completely convinced,”
Turner said in a telephone interview. “Today was extremely
light volume because it was quiet in Europe over the weekend and
there was no major headlines coming out of Europe. Money has
been shifting to bonds out of equities for some time now.
There’s a host of different reasons. Take your pick.”  Nasdaq, NYSE  Nasdaq (MVOLQE)  composite trading volume slipped 15 percent to 1.34
billion shares, the lowest excluding holidays since Aug. 27,
2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Volume for securities
traded on the New York Stock Exchange declined 10 percent to
about 644 million shares, the lowest since Feb. 24, Bloomberg
data show.  About $174 billion worth of shares traded on all  U.S.
exchanges (MVALUSE) , the lowest this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. On the NYSE, about $21 billion changed hands, the
least since Feb. 24.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,371.09 today,
while the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 0.3 percent to
12,959.71. Equities swung between gains and losses as  China 
reported the biggest trade deficit in at least 22 years and the
weakest January-February factory-production gain since 2009, and
retail sales were below the median economist estimate.  Investors also waited as euro-area finance ministers
gathered in Brussels to sign off on the 130 billion-euro ($170
billion) second package for Greece as they focus on  Spain ’s
budget-cutting efforts and  Portugal ’s aid program. June futures
on the S&P 500 rose less than 1 point to 1,367.2 as of 7:35 p.m.
in New York.  Trending Down  The average number of shares trading hands on U.S.
exchanges during the past 50 days fell to 6.7 billion from 9.6
billion on Oct. 7, data compiled by Bloomberg show. For the S&P
500  composite volume , the figure fell to 2.8 billion shares
today from 4 billion five months ago, according to the data.  Trading volume has been declining since October as
customers of U.S. stock mutual funds withdrew more than $68
billion through January even as the S&P 500’s valuation has
recovered by 14 percent. That compares with the $68 billion that
has entered into bond funds in the same period. Since the
beginning of February, about $2.5 billion has gone into equity
funds and almost $30 billion into bond funds, according to
estimated figures by  Investment Company Institute .  Under Mattresses  “There’s still a lot of money sitting under mattresses,
and a lot of money on the fixed-income side,”  Larry Tabb , chief
executive officer of research firm Tabb Group LLC in New York,
said in a telephone interview. “Even though the economy is
starting to pick up, individuals don’t have a lot of disposable
income to invest.”  Trading by individuals has been slowing since the 2008
financial crisis. Daily average volume slipped 9 percent last
quarter compared with a year ago, according to data from E*Trade
Financial Corp., TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and Charles Schwab
Corp. At E*Trade, daily trading volume is 35 percent below its
level at the end of 2008. Revenue-generating trades are down 14
percent in the same period at Schwab.  Investors remain skittish after the S&P 500 ended unchanged
in 2011 after S&P stripped the U.S. of its AAA credit rating,
President  Barack Obama  and Congress struggled over deficit cuts
and Europe was forced to bail out  Greece . The index moved 1.3
percent a day since between April and the end of December,
compared with a 50-year average of 0.6 percent before the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Biggest Traders  Some of the equity markets’ biggest participants are
scaling back. High-frequency trading has accounted for 53
percent of volume in 2012, down from 55 percent last year,
according to Tabb Group. The firms made up 61 percent of all
trading in 2009 and 26 percent in 2006, according to Tabb.  High-frequency trading relies on the rapid and automated
placement of orders, many of which are immediately updated or
canceled, as part of strategies such as market making and
statistical arbitrage and tactics based on momentum.  As trading shrinks, a larger proportion is taking place in
private venues designed for institutional investors. Dark pools,
or venues that don’t publish bids and offers and are used by
fund managers and brokers trying to limit the impact of their
trades on prices, matched 935 million shares a day in January,
or 13.5 percent of stock changing hands, compared with 1.02
billion, or 12.4 percent, a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Rosenblatt Securities Inc. That topped the prior
market-share record of 13.2 percent in April.  “Headed into this year, things actually looked pretty
good,” Tabb said. “You saw unemployment numbers coming down,
the economy generally moving upward and fewer issues around
 Europe . You would think that would start bringing volume back
into the market, but it continues to drift down.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
