News Corp. (NWSA) ’s  Harper Collins  and
four other publishers probed by European Union need to address
regulatory concerns before they can settle the antitrust case,
the EU’s competition commissioner said.  Joaquin Almunia, the antitrust chief, told reporters today
that a settlement was only possible if the publishers were
“ready to remove” the cause of EU objections regarding sales
restrictions. No talks on a settlement are currently taking
place, he said.  The European Commission last year opened an investigation
into  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s deals with e-book publishers Harper Collins,
 Lagardere SCA (MMB) ’s Hachette Livre,  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s Simon & Schuster,
 Pearson Plc (PSON) ’s Penguin and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck
GmbH’s Macmillan division that may restrict sales.  The U.S.  Justice Department  is discussing a possible
settlement with some companies involved in its probe of Apple
and publishers over e-books prices, according to a person
familiar with the matter last week.  The investigation is important to regulators “because the
e-books market is growing very fast and we have an interest to
avoid collusive practices,” Almunia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
