Cetip SA - Mercados Organizados (CTIP3) ,
Brazil’s largest securities clearinghouse, headed to its biggest
drop in four months after  Barclays Capital  cut its
recommendation on concern slower credit growth may hurt profit.  Shares fell 3.1 percent to 32.28 reais at 1:05 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the most on a closing basis since Oct. 24. The benchmark
Bovespa index slid 0.7 percent.  “Prices do not seem to incorporate a scenario of a
slowdown in credit growth,” Barclays’ analysts Henrique Caldeira and Roberto Attuch wrote in a note to clients today in
which they lowered their rating on the stock to the equivalent
of neutral. The central bank may take steps to curb  consumer
lending  after cutting the benchmark borrowing rate, according to
the analysts.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini has lowered the
overnight rate by 275 basis points, or 2.75 percentage point,
since August, even as inflation forecasts increase. Consumer
prices will rise 5.5 percent next year, up from an estimate of
5.2 percent the previous week, according to the median forecast
in a March 9 central bank survey of about 100 economists
published today.  Brazil  targets annual inflation of 4.5 percent,
plus or minus two percentage points.  Barclays now rates Cetip stock “equalweight,” meaning the
company is expected to perform in line with its peers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
