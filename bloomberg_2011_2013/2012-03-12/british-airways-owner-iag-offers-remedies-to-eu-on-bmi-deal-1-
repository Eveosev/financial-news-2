British Airways’ parent
 International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  offered antitrust
concessions to European Union regulators reviewing its bid for
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s BMI unit.  The European Commission extended its deadline to rule on
the deal until March 30 after it received an offer from the
company to alleviate possible competition concerns, according to
a  filing  on its website today. The Brussels-based regulator
didn’t give any details of the proposal.  IAG agreed in December to buy BMI’s main operations, based
at  London ’s Heathrow airport, for 172.5 million pounds ($270
million.) Chief Executive Officer  Willie Walsh  said the deal was
a “unique” opportunity, even amid tough economic conditions. BMI
holds 8.5 percent of takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow,
which operates at 99 percent of capacity and won’t be allowed to
add a third runway, according to Prime Minister  David Cameron .  IAG is working with the EU and is “confident” that it
will receive regulatory approval for the deal, Laura Goodes, a
London-based spokeswoman, said today. She declined to comment on
the content of the proposed competition remedies.  U.K. billionaire  Richard Branson ’s Virgin Atlantic Airways
Ltd. also made an offer for BMI and has said British Airways is
“already too dominant” at Heathrow and that competition
authorities should be concerned.  Lufthansa,  Europe ’s second-biggest airline, will sell BMI’s
discount unit BMIBaby in a separate deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
