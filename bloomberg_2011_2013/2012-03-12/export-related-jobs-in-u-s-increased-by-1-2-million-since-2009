The number of jobs supported by
U.S. exports have grown by  1.2 million  since 2009, government
figures released on the two-year anniversary of the national
export initiative showed.  The increase brought to 9.7 million the number of positions
in 2011 that were influenced by overseas sales of American goods
and services, the Commerce Department reported today in
Washington. Exports jumped to a record $2.1 trillion last year,
up 34 percent from 2009, it said.  President  Barack Obama  has set a goal of doubling exports
in five years, a target he outlined two years ago this week.
Efforts to reach the objective by 2014 include the U.S.-Korea
trade agreement that becomes effective on March 15 and may lift
sales to overseas customers by about $11 billion while
supporting “tens of thousands” of American jobs, the report
said.  Since the national export initiative began in 2010, the
Commerce Department’s International Trade Administration has
assisted more than 9,200 U.S. companies in boosting sales
overseas, including helping 6,000 firms last year to sell abroad
for the first time or expand into new markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
