OAO Mobile Telesystems (MBT) ,  Russia â€™s
biggest mobile operator, said it more than doubled fourth-
quarter profit from a year earlier even as revenue fell by
cutting financing expenses and streamline sales.  Net income climbed to $393 million from $156 million a year
earlier, Mobile Telesystems said today in a statement. That beat
the $390 million average  estimate  of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Revenue fell 0.4 percent to $2.98 billion, according to the
statement. Adjusted operating income before depreciation and
amortization climbed 10 percent to $1.28 billion, while the
Oibda margin expanded to 42.8 percent from 38.7 percent.  The Moscow-based operator expects annual revenue growth of
5 percent to 7 percent for the next four years.  Capital
expenditures  are planned at 20 percent to 22 percent of revenue
this year, and may amount to 15 percent to 18 percent in
2013-15, according to the statement.  MTS, as the company is known, may keep 2011 dividends at
the same level as the previous year, when 60 percent to 70
percent of net income was paid out, Chief Financial Officer
Alexey Kornya said. The board will consider the payout in April
or May, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
