Majid Al Futtaim Holding LLC, the
operator of malls and hotels in the  Middle East , has mandated
two banks to raise a loan of about $500 million in Egyptian
pounds to fund its Mall of  Egypt  development.  “The money is earmarked for the Mall of Egypt,” the
company’s treasury manager Daniele Vecchi said in a telephone
interview from Dubai today. “When the mall project is
activated” possibly before the end of year “we’ll need to
finalize the funding,” he said.  Reuters reported earlier today that the company mandated
Banque Misr SAE and  National Bank of Egypt  as lead arrangers for
the deal, which Vecchi declined to confirm. The operator of
 Carrefour SA (CA)  stores in the region has no immediate plans to tap
bond markets because the Dubai-based company has an “amazingly
strong liquidity position,” Vecchi said.  Majid Al Futtaim sold a $400 million Islamic bond in
January. The yield on its 5.85 percent sukuk due February 2017
fell 39 basis points since it began trading last month to 5.26
percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
