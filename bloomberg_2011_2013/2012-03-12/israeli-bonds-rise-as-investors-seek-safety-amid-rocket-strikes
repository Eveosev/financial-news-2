Israel ’s short-term government
bonds rose, pushing yields lower for the first time in eight
days, as demand for the country’s safer assets increased amid
violence in the south.  The yield on the 3.5 percent notes due September 2013 fell
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 2.63 percent,
the lowest since Feb. 29, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.
The yield on the 5.5 percent notes retreated three basis points
to 4.71 percent. The  TA-25 benchmark stock index  dropped the
most in almost one week, declining 1.1 percent.  Israeli air strikes on the Hamas-controlled  Gaza Strip 
killed three Palestinians as the death toll in the area over
four days of conflict rose to 21. Prime Minister  Benjamin
Netanyahu  said that “the army continues to strike at the
terrorists in Gaza with strength and resoluteness.”  “Investors are shortening positions and reducing risk to
local assets as violence in the south of the country continues
heightening geopolitical risk,” said Guy Lazarovich, a bond
trader at IBI-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd.  The  Finance Ministry  sold a total of 1.25 billion shekels
($330 million) of bonds at an auction today, according to
ministry data posted on Bloomberg. Investors sought 4.6 times
the 250 million shekels of the January 2022 benchmark bonds
offered, compared with 5.3 times at last week’s sale.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, fell less than one basis
point to 2.55 percent. The  Tel-Bond 40 Index (TEL-B40)  of corporate bonds
gained 0.1 to 262.69. The shekel strengthened 0.2 percent to
3.7866 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
