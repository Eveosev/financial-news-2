Nestle Foods Nigeria Plc (NESTLE) , the West
African nation’s largest food company by market value, jumped to
its highest level in more than 10 years on investors’
expectations the company’s products are in strong demand.  The stock increased by the maximum daily limit of 5 percent
to 463.61 naira at the close in Lagos, the commercial capital,
the most since January 2002. It is up 4 percent this year,
compared with a 1.7 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange
All-Share Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Nestle has delivered strong returns, has a good corporate
governance and a strong growth in demand over the next five
years,” Akinbamidele Akintola, a research analyst with Lagos-
based  Renaissance Capital , said by phone today.  More than 1 million shares, or six times the three-month
average, traded today. Nestle Foods, a unit of  Nestle SA (NESN) , the
world’s biggest food company, said last year it plans to double
business in Africa’s most populous country of more than 167
million people within three years. Nigeria is Nestle’s second-
biggest market in the continent after  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
