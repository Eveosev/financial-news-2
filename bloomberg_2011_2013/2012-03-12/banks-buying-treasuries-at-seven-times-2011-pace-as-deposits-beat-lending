U.S. banks bought more government
and related  debt  in the first two months of 2012 than they did
in all of last year, an endorsement of Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke ’s assessment of the economy that’s boosting
demand for bonds even with yields near the lowest on record.  Commercial lenders purchased $78.2 billion of Treasuries
and securities of agencies in January and February, compared
with $62.6 billion in all of 2011, bringing their holdings to
$1.78 trillion, Fed data show. Deposits exceeded loans by a
record $1.63 trillion last month, up from $1.17 trillion in
January 2011, providing scope to buy more bonds.  While the economy has expanded for eight straight quarters,
unemployment at 8.3 percent, the scheduled end of the Bush-era
tax cuts, a mandatory $1 trillion in federal budget cuts over 10
years and the presidential election campaign have made banks
hesitant to accelerate lending. Instead of providing credit,
they are exploiting the gap between the Fed’s target interest
rate for overnight loans and Treasury yields to make profits.  “Bank managers are still very cautious, and that’s
appropriate,” Jeffrey Caughron, a partner at Baker Group LP in
 Oklahoma City  who advises community banks on investments of more
than $30 billion, said in a March 6 telephone interview. “We
don’t expect negative growth or a recession, but we expect
sluggish growth. There’s not the kind of loan demand that banks
are used to having, so banks have excess liquidity and the place
to go is the  bond market .”  Caughron advises clients to invest in government and
municipal bonds.  Yields Rise  Banks are buying more Treasuries even with yields on
benchmark 10-year notes about 35 basis points above the record
low of 1.67 percent on Sept. 23 because Bernanke has pledged to
keep rates around zero through 2014. The  difference  between the
federal funds rate and the yield on the 10-year Treasury was at
177 basis points, or 1.77 percentage points, today. In 2006 and
2007, yields were below the Fed’s key rate.  The benchmark 10-year  yield  was little changed at 2.02
percent at 2:42 p.m.  New York  time, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The yield advanced five basis points last week,
the most since the period ended Feb. 10.  ‘Frustratingly Low’  Low yields will allow the U.S. to finance a fourth straight
annual budget deficit of more than $1 trillion at a cost of 3.1
percent of gross domestic product, compared with 3.8 percent in
2000 and 4.1 percent in 1999, when the nation had budget
surpluses, according to Office of Management and Budget and
International Monetary Fund data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bond strategists forecast that yields will rise by the end
of 2012, with the median estimate for the 10-year note at 2.47
percent. The benchmark government issue yielded an average of
4.9 percent for the past two decades.  “Treasury yields are going to remain lower than people
think, frustratingly low for a while,” Eric Pellicciaro, head
of global rates investment at New York-based BlackRock Inc.,
which manages $1.14 trillion in fixed-income assets, said in a
March 7 telephone interview. “That’s a very good backdrop for
fixed income.”  Pellicciaro said he is buying mortgage securities and
recommends Treasuries when yields rise to between 2.25 percent
to 2.5 percent. “Under two percent is not a lot of value.”  Buying Time  Banks have increased holdings of government debt since 2008
to protect their capital after the credit crisis caused more
than $2 trillion in writedowns and losses at global financial
institutions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Fed’s low-rate policy “has been a plan to buy time for
the banks to take free money and invest it, and make some kind
of spread, and work their way out of the hole they were in,”
said Mark MacQueen, a partner and money manager in Austin,
 Texas , at Sage Advisory Services Ltd., which oversees $10
billion, in a telephone interview on March 6. “Banks are trying
to clean up and improve the appearance of their balance sheets
and buying Treasuries accomplishes this.”  They have just as much reason to own Treasuries now after
falling profits led banks and brokers to announce more than
50,000 job cuts in the past year, Bloomberg data show.  The average net interest margin at the four largest U.S.
banks -- JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup
Inc. and  Wells Fargo & Co . -- shrank to 2.99 percent in the
fourth quarter from 3.17 percent a year earlier. Net interest
margin is a gauge of bank profitability based on the difference
between the cost of funds and what they earn on assets.  New Rules  Lenders have added Treasuries to meet new reserve rules
from the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law and  Basel  III
regulations set by the  Bank for International Settlements  in
Basel,  Switzerland .  In 2011 banks bought $30.6 billion in government securities
in the first half and $32 billion in the second half. Purchases
in 2011 fell from $190 billion the year before. Bank of America,
the second-biggest U.S. lender, cut its $49 billion holdings of
Treasuries to about $43 billion at the end of last year, Jerome F. Dubrowski, a company spokesman, wrote in a March 8 e-mail.  While the  unemployment rate  remained steady for a second
month at the lowest since February 2009, and the index of U.S.
leading indicators rose 0.4 percent in January, its fourth
straight increase, Bernanke said in testimony before Congress
March 1 that economic conditions may warrant low  interest rates 
at least through late 2014. The central bank has kept its
benchmark rate about zero since December 2008.  Bernanke’s Caution  Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee on
Feb. 29 that, while there have been “positive developments” in
the labor market, it “remains far from normal.”  A month earlier, Bernanke said the Fed was considering
another set of  asset purchases  to boost economic growth even
after the central bank bought $2.3 trillion in bonds in two
stages of so-called quantitative easing ending in June.  The central bank lowered its projected range for growth
this year to a range of 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent, from 2.5
percent to 2.9 percent in November. The range for next year is
2.8 percent to 3.2 percent, down from a previous forecast of 3
percent to 3.5 percent. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News is for growth of 2.2 percent.  While those rates would be up from 1.7 percent in 2011,
they’re below the average of 3.1 percent in 2004 through 2006,
before the start of the biggest financial crisis since the Great
Depression. In the past 60 years, the  U.S. economy  grew at an
average annual rate of 3.2 percent.  Spending Cuts  A deficit reduction law passed last year that requires $1
trillion in discretionary spending cuts spread over 10 years
would take effect in January 2013 if Congress and the
administration can’t agree on an alternative plan.  The administration of President  Barack Obama  has called for
$1.5 trillion in tax increases, in part by allowing tax cuts
from the era of President  George W. Bush  to expire for families
earning more than $250,000, as well as spending to boost jobs as
part of his 2013 budget request. The four major Republican
candidates said they would lower taxes and cut federal spending
if elected.  “In the next eight or nine months, we face some
headwinds,”  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy
at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a
telephone interview March 6. “The real issue here is that
there’s just not that much creation of credit.”  Loans Below Peak  Ader forecasts a 2.75 percent yield on the 10-year at year-
end and a 1.5 percent GDP for this year.  While commercial and industrial  loans  at U.S. banks have
risen to $1.38 trillion from $1.2 trillion in October 2010,
they’re below the peak of $1.62 trillion reached in October
2008. Credit losses for U.S. lenders fell to $25.4 billion, the
lowest in 15 quarters, the FDIC said Feb. 28.  Banks had $1.58 trillion in cash as of Feb. 29, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. While down from a record $1.9
trillion in July, the amount was $287 billion in 2007.  “With the elections coming up, loan demand will stay weak
and banks will continue to buy the securities and keep rates
low,”  Priya Misra , head of U.S. rates strategy in New York at
Bank of America, one of the 21 primary dealers of U.S.
 government securities  that trade with the Fed, said in a March 5
telephone interview. “Banks are not voluntarily buying these
Treasuries. They just don’t have enough loan demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
