Tianjin Tasly Pharmaceutical Co.
and Beijing Tongrentang Co. paced gains by Chinese health-care
stocks on expectations earnings will withstand a slowdown in the
world’s second-largest economy.  Tianjin Tasly gained 3.4 percent to 40 yuan at the close in
Shanghai trading, while Beijing Tongrentang climbed 3.5 percent
to 15.09 yuan. A  measure  tracking health-care stocks on the  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  rallied 2.7 percent, the biggest advance since Jan. 20
and compared with a 0.4 percent decline by the broader gauge.  “The defensive nature of pharmaceutical stocks stands out
in a slowing economy environment,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-
based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285
million. “Besides stable earnings, prospects that the
government will invest more in the health-care industry are also
driving up the stock.”  China reported the biggest trade deficit in at least 22
years on March 10, adding to data last week on factory output
and retail sales that signaled slowing growth. Premier  Wen
Jiabao  cut the government’s 2012 economic expansion target to
7.5 percent on March 5, down from 8 percent over the past seven
years  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost,  Matthew Oakley   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
