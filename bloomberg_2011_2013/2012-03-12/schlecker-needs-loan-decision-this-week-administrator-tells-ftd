German retailer Schlecker needs a
decision on financing from the state-owned development bank KfW
Group this week so the company doesnâ€™t risk failing to find an
investor, insolvency administrator Arndt Geiwitz told the
Financial Times Deutschland in an interview.  Remaining employees need to commit to a pay cut in the
following week, the FTD cited Geiwitz as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
