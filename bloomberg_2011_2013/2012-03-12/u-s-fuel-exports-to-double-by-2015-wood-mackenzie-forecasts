U.S. exports of gasoline, diesel
and other fuels will more than double in the next three years as
refiners take advantage of a growing supply of domestic crudes
and ship more fuel to  emerging markets , according to research
firm Wood Mackenzie Ltd.  Exports will rise by 450,000 barrels a day by 2015 as
domestic demand shrinks and more products are sent to  Latin
America , Africa and other regions where fuel use is increasing,
Alan Gelder, head of downstream consulting at Edinburgh-based
Wood Mackenzie, said during a presentation at an American Fuel
and Petrochemical Manufacturers conference in San Diego.  The U.S. exported more gasoline, diesel and other fuels
than it imported in 2011 for the first time since 1949 as sales
in  North America  contracted and consumption in regions like
Latin America climbed, the Energy Department said Feb. 29.
Shipments abroad of petroleum products exceeded imports by
439,000 barrels a day last year, the department said.  “U.S. gasoline demand is going one way, and that’s down,”
Gelder said. “So to the question of can the U.S. transform into
a global export center, we say yes. That can be done.”  Shipments outside the U.S. will increase at a rate of
60,000 to 80,000 barrels a day in the years after 2015, he said.  U.S. fuel demand will drop 0.4 percent to 18.77 million
barrels a day in 2012, the Energy Department forecast last month
in its Short-Term Energy Outlook.  Consumption  of oil and
petroleum products dropped 7.8 percent between 2005 and 2010,
according to the department.  Mexico’s use of U.S.-made gasoline was 44 percent higher
last year than in 2010, the Energy Department said last month.  Gulf Refineries  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  plan to
reverse the direction of the Seaway oil pipeline on June 1,
sending crude from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast.
Stockpiles at Cushing, the delivery point for New York futures,
surged 23 percent this year to a seven-month high on March 2.  Refineries on the Gulf Coast were operating at 86.8 percent
of capacity in the week ended March 2, up from 80.5 percent a
year ago, Energy Department data show. Motiva Enterprises LLC is
scheduled to double capacity at its 300,000-barrel-a-day Port
Arthur refinery in Texas during the first quarter.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  exported an average of 65,000 barrels
per day of gasoline, or 5.1 percent of production, and 180,000
barrels per day of distillates, 17 percent of output, in the
fourth quarter, Bill Day, a spokesman at the company’s
headquarters in  San Antonio , said in an e-mail.  Motiva’s expansion will probably mean “additional volumes
exported” from the Gulf Coast, Bill Klesse, Valero’s chief
executive officer, said during the conference in San Diego.
Refinery closures on the East Coast, including  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) ’s
Marcus Hook and  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’ Trainer plants, have boosted
demand for fuel deliveries from the Gulf.  “There will be more supply, no question about it,” Klesse
said in an interview. “The export markets have continued
strong. The refineries that shut down on the East Coast have
created an opportunity.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
