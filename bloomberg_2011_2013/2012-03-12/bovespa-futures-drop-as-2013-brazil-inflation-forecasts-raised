Bovespa futures fell, a sign the
stock gauge may fall for a second day, as economists covering
 Brazil  increased forecasts for 2013 inflation, spurring concern
higher prices will erode consumer purchasing power.  Consumer prices in Brazil will increase 5.5 percent next
year, up from an estimate of 5.2 percent the previous week,
according to the median forecast in a March 9 central bank
survey of about 100 economists published today.  Bovespa-index futures dropped 0.6 percent to 66,800 at 9:46
a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The scheduled 9 a.m. start of trading was
delayed for 40 minutes because of “MarketData” problems,
BM&FBovespa said in a statement.  “The survey continues to show markets are uncertain about
the central bank’s ability to fight inflation over the coming
years,” Italo Lombardi, a New York-based economist for  Latin
America  at Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in an e-mail to
clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
