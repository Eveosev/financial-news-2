Greece ’s sovereign debt may fall to
as low as 116 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product by
2020 if a larger number of private sector institutions
participate in a debt swap, Reuters reported, citing two
unidentified European Union officials.  That level of indebtedness would be below the 120 percent
the International Monetary Fund views as sustainable and
compares with a target of 121.5 percent under the current
participation rate in the debt swap of 96 percent, the newswire
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
