Egypt â€™s Ministry of Finance expects
the  budget deficit  for the fiscal year that ends in June to
widen to 150 billion Egyptian pounds ($25 billion), higher than
previously forecast, the state-run Middle East News Agency said.  Planning and International Cooperation Minister Fayza Aboulnaga had announced a target of 144 billion Egyptian pounds,
or 8.7 percent of expected economic output, in January. The
previous target was 134 billion pounds. The revision stems from
election expenses and increased payments to some state
employees, MENA said, citing Abdel Aziz Mohamed, undersecretary
at the ministry.  Egypt is seeking a $3.2 billion loan from the International
Monetary Fund to help the economy recover after the uprising
that ousted  Hosni Mubarak  in February last year, which kept
investors and tourists away and drained foreign-exchange
reserves. The government says it will invite an IMF mission to
visit the country this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
