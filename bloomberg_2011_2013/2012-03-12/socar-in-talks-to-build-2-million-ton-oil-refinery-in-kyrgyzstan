State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan  is in
talks with the Kyrgyz government on building an oil refinery
with processing capacity of 2 million metric tons a year, or
40,000 barrels a day, in the Central Asian country.  Socar, as the Azeri oil and gas producer is known, may
build the refinery in the Chuyskaya region, Kyrgyzstan’s Energy
Ministry said in a  statement  on its website today. David
Mammadov, a deputy head of Socar, visited Kyrgyzstan at the
beginning of the month to discuss the project with the ministry,
according to the statement.  Nizamaddin Quliyev, a spokesman for Socar, didn’t
immediately comment when called by Bloomberg. Rovnaq Abdullayev,
the head of the company, signed an “agreement in principle”
with Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev on building a refinery
by the end of 2013, Azerbaijan’s state news service Azartac
reported in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
