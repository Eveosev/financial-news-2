Mediclinic International Ltd. (MDC) 
jumped to the highest on record after saying Coronation Asset
Management Ltd. increased its holding in  South Africa ’s largest
publicly traded private hospital group by market value.  Mediclinic climbed as much as 14 percent to 41.99 rand, the
highest since at least 1990 when Bloomberg started compiling
data on the shares, and traded at 36.91 rand at the close in
Johannesburg. The stock is up 9.9 percent this year, outpacing a
6 percent gain for the  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) .  Coronation informed Mediclinic on Mar. 9 it had increased
its holding to 8.45 percent from 4.47 percent, Mediclinic said
in a statement today. The International Hospitals Network
Partnership, an associate of Trilantic Capital Partners, reduced
its interest from 10 percent to 6.01 percent.  “We think it’s a very attractive business and it’s not a
liquid stock that’s easy to build a stake in,” Sarah-Jane
Alexander, an equity analyst at Coronation said. “It should
continue to grow its earnings quite strongly.”  Mediclinic  trades  at 14.2 times earnings for the year to
March 31 2013, while the  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH)  trades
on 11.5 percent times 2012 earnings, according to Bloomberg
consensus forecasts. The higher multiple is justified by the
company’s geographic spread and the 46 percent of sales made in
 Switzerland , Alexander said.  “When a company like Coronation is buying it shows
confidence as it’s assumed it’s done its homework,” Andrew Bryson, a Johannesburg-based derivatives trader at BoE Asset
Management said by phone. “The underpin of a big unit trust
buyer is good news for a company and there is always the chance
it may buy more.”  Coronation managed assets of 274 billion rand ($36 billion)
as of Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
