A paralyzed man who wants doctors
to end his life can have his case tried in court, a U.K. judge
ruled.  Tony Nicklinson, who is paralyzed below the neck and unable
to speak, won the right to a judicial review. The case is of
“great social, ethical and religious significance,” Judge
William Charles said in a written  ruling .  Nicklinson argues that current laws against assisted
suicide breach his human rights. He was left with so-called
locked-in syndrome after suffering a stroke in 2005, which means
he can only communicate by blinking.  “Why should I be denied a right, the right to die of my
own choosing when able bodied people have that right and only my
disability prevents me from exercising that right?,” Nicklinson
said in a statement published with the judgment.  The case is Between: Tony Nicklinson and Ministry of
Justice,  High Court  of Justice, Queen’s  Bench Division ,
HQ11X04443.  To contact the reporter on this story:
