Ethanol futures climbed to the
highest level in more than three months in  Chicago  as gains for
corn signaled higher manufacturing costs.  Futures followed corn higher on speculation that  Argentina ,
the world’s second-largest shipper of the grain behind the U.S.,
will curb exports because of damage caused by drought. Corn is
the primary feedstock for ethanol made in the U.S.  “Ethanol is definitely riding on the corn,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest in Chicago. “We’ve heard no good
news from Argentina. Obviously they’re looking at our market now
and that’s spilling over into ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery climbed 2.8 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.294 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since Dec. 5. Prices have gained 4.1 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  was unchanged
at $2.31 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel added 0.5 cents to
$2.275, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf advanced 1.5 cents to $2.325 a
gallon and on the West Coast the additive lost 1.5 cents to
$2.395.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 14.5 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $6.595 a bushel in Chicago, the biggest gain for a
most-active contract since Dec. 19.  Distillers are losing 9 cents per gallon of ethanol, based
on current prices for corn and the biofuel and assuming a bushel
of the grain generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
