Lithuanian Parliamentary Chairwoman
Irena Degutiene called for early elections this summer after
President Dalia Grybauskaite refused a request to fire a
minister, the  Baltic News Service  reported.  Grybauskaite refused today to approve the dismissal of
Internal Affairs Minister Raimundas Palaitis after Prime
Minister Andrius Kubilius asked for his removal last week.
Kubilius criticized Palaitis’ actions in firing officials from
the financial-crime investigation service.  The decision to reject Palaitis’s dismissal “increases
political tensions and puts in doubt the president’s confidence
in the government,” Degutiene said.  The next general election is scheduled for October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
