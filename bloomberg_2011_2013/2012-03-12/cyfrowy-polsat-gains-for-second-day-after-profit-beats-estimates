Cyfrowy Polsat SA (CPS) , Poland’s biggest
television group, rose for a second day after fourth-quarter
profit beat analysts’ estimates.  The stock rose as much as 2.5 percent, the most since March
2, and traded 1.7 percent higher at 13.88 zloty as of 9:34 a.m.
in Warsaw.  Net income more than doubled to 76.3 million zloty ($24.4
million), from 36.9 million zloty a year earlier, the company
said in a statement today. That exceeded the 57.9 million-zloty
mean estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
