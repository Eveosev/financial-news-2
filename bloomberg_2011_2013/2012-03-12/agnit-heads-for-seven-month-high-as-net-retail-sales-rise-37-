OAO Magnit (MGNT) , a Russian food
retailer, headed for its strongest level in seven months after
net retail sales climbed 37 percent to 33.3 billion rubles
($1.1. billion) in February from a year earlier.  The shares rose for a third day, adding 1.2 percent to
3,700 rubles as of 3:55 p.m. in Moscow. A close at that level
would mark their highest price since Aug. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
