A measure of job prospects in the
U.S. rose in February to the highest level in more than three
years, another sign the labor market recovery is gaining
traction.  The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index increased
1.4 percent to 107.5, the highest level since July 2008, from
106 the prior month, figures from the New York-based private
research group showed today. The measure climbed 6.1 percent
from February 2011.  The report is consistent with Labor Department data last
week that showed payroll growth exceeded 200,000 for a third
month and unemployment held at a three-year low. Gains in wages
that come from a better jobs market help sustain household
spending, especially in the face of elevated gas  prices .  “Rapid job growth is likely to continue in the next
several months,”  Gad Levanon , director of macroeconomic
research at the Conference Board, said today in a statement.  The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market
indicators to forecast short-term hiring trends. On average, the
gauge can signal a rebound in hiring as little as three months
before the fact and can predict job declines six to nine months
in advance, the Conference Board said.  Improvements in seven of the index’s eight components
contributed to the increase in the gauge. These included a
decline in the number of Americans saying jobs are hard to get,
a jump in temporary employment and a drop in applications for
 unemployment benefits , the Conference Board said.  Payrolls grew by 227,000 workers last month after a gain of
284,000 in January, the Labor Department’s report showed on
March 9. The  jobless rate  held at 8.3 percent, the lowest level
since February 2009. In the past six months, employers created
about 1.2 million jobs, the most over a similar span since 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
