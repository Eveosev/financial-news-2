Peter Thiel, the billionaire
venture capitalist and PayPal Inc. co-founder who has encouraged
would-be entrepreneurs to drop out of college, will teach a
lecture course at  Stanford University  on startups.  Thiel will instruct students in “Computer Science 183:
Startup,”  Mehran Sahami , an associate professor in the
computer-science department, said in a telephone interview. His
course is scheduled to begin next month and enrollment will be
limited to 250, Sahami said.  Thiel, 44, who received undergraduate and law degrees from
Stanford, became a billionaire with investments in PayPal, the
Internet payment company now owned by  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ; gamemaker Zynga
Inc.; and LinkedIn Corp. He now uses some of his wealth in his
20 Under 20 Thiel Fellowship program, which pays students as
much as $100,000 each, over two years, to drop out of college
and pursue startups. That doesn’t keep him from helping students
pursuing a traditional education.  “He’s done it before and he actually participates quite
frequently here,” said Lisa Lapin, a spokeswoman for the
university, which is based near  Palo Alto ,  California .  Thiel, whose Founders Fund was the first outside investor
in Facebook Inc. in 2004, is ranked No. 293 on a Forbes list in
September of the richest Americans. The founder of Clarium
Capital Management LLC also started the Thiel Foundation, which
runs the 20 Under 20 Thiel Fellowship program.  Thiel didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  Jim O’Neill , a spokesman for Clarium, didn’t
immediately respond to a phone call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
