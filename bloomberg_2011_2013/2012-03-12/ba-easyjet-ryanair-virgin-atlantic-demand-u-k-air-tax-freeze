Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ,  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ,
Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. and British Airways-owner  IAG (IAG) , are
calling on the U.K. government to halt a planned increase in
aviation tax and investigate its effect on economic growth.  Air Passenger Duty, which is levied per passenger,
discourages visitors to the U.K. and so destroys jobs in
tourism, hospitality and aviation, the carriers said in a joint
statement today. An independent survey would show the damage
done to the U.K. economy by the tax as lost jobs outweigh the
benefits of the revenue generated, according to the statement.  “Aviation wants to, and should be, playing a leading role
in economic recovery,” airline chief executive officers,
including Ryanair’s  Michael O’Leary  and EasyJet’s Carolyn McCall, said in the statement. “But the U.K. imposes the
highest aviation taxes in the world, and keeps on increasing
them without any analysis whatever of their overall economic
impact.”  Air Passenger Duty is set to rise by 8 percent from April
1, the airlines said. An economy passenger on a return journey
within the U.K. will pay 26 pounds ($41) tax, and the charge
would rise to 92 pounds for trips to Australia.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  will deliver his
annual budget March 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
