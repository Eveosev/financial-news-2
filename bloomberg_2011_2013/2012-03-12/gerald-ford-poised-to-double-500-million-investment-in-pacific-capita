Gerald J. Ford, who became a
billionaire buying distressed lenders during the savings and
loan crisis, could reap $650 million from his 2010 investment in
 Pacific Capital Bancorp (PCBC)  following its sale to UnionBanCal Corp.  Ford stands to receive $1.15 billion for his 25 million-
share investment in Pacific Capital, a  stake  that cost him $500
million in 2010, according to a filing last year from the  Santa
Barbara , California-based bank. UnionBanCal, based in  San
Francisco , said yesterday it will purchase Pacific Capital for
$46 a share, 60 percent more than its March 9 closing price.
Completion is scheduled for the fourth quarter.  Affiliates of Ford bought into Pacific Capital after the
bank said its survival was in doubt and that shareholders might
be wiped out. The company hadn’t reported a quarterly  profit 
since the first three months of 2008. After Ford’s investment,
Pacific Capital posted net income in the fourth quarter of 2010
and has been profitable ever since.  “Our guys did a terrific job of assessing and managing the
business,” Ford, who is the bank’s chairman, said in a
telephone interview. Deborah Whiteley, a spokeswoman for Pacific
Capital, didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.  Ford, 67, who isn’t related to the former U.S. president or
the founders of the U.S. auto-making empire, amassed his fortune
during the 1980s and 1990s by acquiring distressed banks and
turning them around.  The Texan, who ranks 764 on the Forbes  billionaires list ,
transformed Golden State Bancorp Inc. into the second-largest
U.S. savings and loan, which he sold to  Citigroup Inc. (C)  in 2002
for $5.3 billion. Much of his wealth was tied to  California ,
where Golden State was based and Pacific Capital and
UnionBanCorp are headquartered.  Pacific Capital has $5.9 billion in assets and is the
parent company of Santa Barbara Bank & Trust, which has 47
branches in California. Pacific Capital’s shares rose 57 percent
to close at $45.03 yesterday in  New York . They had fallen 7.7
percent in the 12 months through March 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
