Canadian natural gas fell as
warmer-than-normal weather in the U.S. pares demand for imported
furnace fuels.  Alberta  gas for April delivery fell 1.7 percent. Heating
demand across the U.S. will average 59 percent below normal
through March 19, according to Weather Derivatives, a forecaster
based in Belton,  Missouri . New York futures dropped 2.4 percent
to a 10-year low.  “The weather outlook is still bearish,” said Kyle Cooper,
director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston. If futures
breach the 10-year intraday low of $2.231 per million British
thermal units “you have only lower to go,” he said.  Alberta gas for April delivery fell 3 cents to C$1.705 a
gigajoule ($1.63 per million British thermal units) as of 1:45
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada

settlement since February 2002.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
7.1 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $2.1509 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas slipped 2.8 cents to $1.988 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas was down 0.5 cent at $2.0981.  Alberta System  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 17.1 billion cubic
feet, 327 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2 billion cubic feet at
Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.18 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 587 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 2.07 billion cubic feet today, or 78 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.08
billion cubic feet at 12:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
