Russia , the world’s largest oil
producer, plans to export 12 cargoes of East Siberian Pacific
Ocean pipeline, or ESPO, crude in April, one less than March, a
loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  A total of 1.2 million metric tons, equivalent to 293,200
barrels a day, of ESPO crude will be loaded from the port of
Kozmino in Russia’s  Far East  near the city of Nakhodka in April,
according to the plan.  Russia also plans to ship three cargoes of 100,000 tons
each of ESPO for loading on May 1 to May 6, the plan showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
