Earth Heat Resources Ltd. (EHR) , an
Australian company with assets in Argentina, hired Corporacion
Interamericana para el Financiamento de Infraestructura as
mandated lead arranger for a $22.5 million loan, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds will be used for drilling three of four wells and
the financing adds to $134 million of project finance debt from
the  Inter-American Development Bank  which will also be used to
develop the companyâ€™s geothermal venture in Copahue, Argentina.
That facility should be completed as early as June, the data
show.  Adelaide-based Earth Heat, whose shares have dropped almost
50 percent in the past year, also signed an agreement with AGS
Capital Group LLC for A$17.5 million of capital contingency
financing, the data show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
