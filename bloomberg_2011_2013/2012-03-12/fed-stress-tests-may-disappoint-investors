Bloomberg's  Erik Schatzker , 
Scarlet Fu, Sara Eisen and Stephanie Ruhle report that 
investors may be disappointed by how U.S. banks perform in 
Federal Reserve stress tests as examiners expect consumer-loan 
losses to surpass the industry’s estimates if there’s 
another severe recession, analysts say. They speak on Bloomberg 
Television's "Inside Track." (Source: Bloomberg)  Running Time: 04:27
