Emerging-market stocks posted their
biggest decline in almost a week as Chinese trade and retail
sales data signaled a deepening slowdown in the global economy.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  declined for the first time
in three days, losing 0.9 percent to 1,050.50 at the close in
 New York .  Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar ,
 Brazil ’s biggest retailer, led declines on Brazil’s  Bovespa (IBOV) 
index among companies that depend on consumer demand.  LG Chem
Ltd. (051910) , the chemical maker that counts  China  as its biggest export
market, retreated 3.5 percent in  Seoul .  China had the largest trade deficit in at least 22 years
last month, the weakest gain in factory production between
January and February since 2009, and year-to-date retail sales
missed analysts’ estimates, government data released March 9 and
10 showed. European finance ministers are moving toward signing
off on the 130 billion-euro ($170 billion) aid package for
 Greece .  “Global demand is abating and China is one of the major
export countries, so of course it’s very much affected by this
weakening general global demand,” Daniel Lenz, chief emerging
market strategist at DZ Bank AG, said by phone from  Frankfurt .
“China is still growing strongly in comparison to other
countries, and there is of course more risk to the downside on
exports than on imports.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese mainland
stocks traded in  Hong Kong  slid 0.3 percent, trimming its
advance this year to 13 percent. The gauge is trailing the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index, which has advanced 15 percent.  Developed (MXWO) 
stocks have rallied 9.1 percent.  ETF Slides  The  iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index  exchange-traded
fund, the most-traded ETF that tracks developing-nation shares,
slipped 1.1 percent to $43.31, its largest one-day drop since
March 6.  Brazil’s Bovespa declined for a second day, losing 0.5
percent. Pao de Acucar dropped 2.7 percent while mining company
 Vale SA (VALE5) , whose top export market is China, fell 1.2 percent for
a sixth day of declines, the longest losing streak in seven
months. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
dropped 0.4 percent, slipping for the first time in four days.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  fell 0.5 percent in Istanbul and
the lira depreciated 0.4 percent versus the dollar to the lowest
level in almost seven weeks.  Turkey ’s current-account gap was unchanged from a year
earlier at $6 billion in January, exceeding the median estimate
of $5.5 billion in a Bloomberg survey of six economists.  Sensex Gains  The zloty weakened 0.6 percent against the euro after
Narodowy Bank Polski increased its 2012  inflation forecast  to
4.1 percent from 3.1 percent, at the same time as it cut the
nation’s economic-growth estimate for this year to 3 percent
from 3.1 percent.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  added 0.5 percent as the
 Reserve Bank  of  India  reduced the amount banks must keep in
reserve to 4.75 percent from 5.5 percent on March 9, the lowest
level since 2004 and the first such action outside a central
bank policy meeting since July 2010.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.2 percent and  Taiwan ’s
 Taiex Index (TWSE)  fell 1.1 percent, the most in  Asia .  The extra yield investors demand to own emerging-market
debt over  U.S. Treasuries  fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 339 basis points, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
