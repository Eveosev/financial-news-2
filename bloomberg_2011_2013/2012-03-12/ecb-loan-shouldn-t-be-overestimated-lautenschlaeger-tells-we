Bundesbank Vice President Sabine Lautenschlaeger said the economic impact of the  European Central
Bank ’s loans to lenders shouldn’t be overestimated as banks are
unlikely to immediately use the cash for new business,  Die Welt 
reported in a preview of a story that will run tomorrow.  While the ECB’s three-year loans to banks won’t solve any
solvency problems at lenders, they will ease the interbank
market situation, the newspaper cited Lautenschlaeger as saying.  She added that while it was to “a certain degree
inevitable” that the ECB had to take on more risk during the
global financial crisis,  Europe  needs to keep the risks more
carefully in mind, Welt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
