Banco BMG SA, the Brazilian lender
that collects payments via payroll deductions, plans to sell
five-year dollar-denominated bonds overseas to yield about 9.75
percent, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The Belo Horizonte-based bank hired  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and BCP
Securities LLC to arrange the sale, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because terms aren’t set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
