Kenya’s shilling advanced,
reversing an earlier decline, and headed for its strongest level
in almost 13 months as the central bank said there is a
“tight” money market.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.8 percent and was trading 0.3 percent stronger at
82.20 per dollar by 11:53 a.m. in Nairobi. A close at that level
would be the highest since Feb. 25, 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling gain is being driven by tight liquidity seen
in the money market with interbank rates being elevated,”
Raphael Agung, a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of
Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “The planned $600
million foreign currency-denominated loan by the government is
also contributing” to the shilling’s advance, he said.  The average interbank rate increased to 23.08 percent, the
central bank said in its weekly bulletin on March 9.  “The money market was tight in the week ending March 7,
partly due to continued remittances of taxes to government as
well as increased net government borrowing,” the central bank
said.  Kenya  is looking to obtain $600 million in foreign loans to
finance infrastructure projects.  Tanzania’s shilling depreciated 0.3 percent to 1,595 per
dollar, while the Ugandan shilling weakened 0.3 percent to 2,447
against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
