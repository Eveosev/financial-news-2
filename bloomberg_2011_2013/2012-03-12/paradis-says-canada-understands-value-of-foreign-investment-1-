Canadian Industry Minister
Christian Paradis said the government “understands the
importance” of attracting foreign investment.  Paradis made the comments in response to a question by an
opposition lawmaker in Ottawa regarding reports that Glencore
International Plc has expressed interest in acquiring  Canada ’s
biggest grain handler  Viterra Inc. (VT)  Paradis didn’t mention either
company in his response.  “Unlike the opposition, our government understands the
importance of attracting foreign investments to our economy,”
Paradis told lawmakers in Parliament. “Foreign investments help
Canadian companies to grow and innovate and provides new
opportunities to connect our firms to the world. Our government
will continue to welcome investment that benefits Canada.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
