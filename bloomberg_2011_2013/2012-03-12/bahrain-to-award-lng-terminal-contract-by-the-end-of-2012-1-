Bahrain will award a tender to
build a liquefied natural gas import terminal by the end of this
year, the nation’s oil minister said.  The Gulf state plans to import 400 million cubic feet of
natural gas, Abdul Hussain Mirza said today in an interview in
 Kuwait  at a meeting of the International Energy Forum, adding
that the country was producing 1.5 billion cubic feet of the
fuel. He didn’t specify a timeframe for the imports.  The nation plans to expand a crude pipeline from  Saudi
Arabia  to Bahrain by 120,000 barrels a day to 350,000 barrels.
The facility, estimated to cost an initial $350 million, will be
built by 2014, Mirza said. Extra oil volumes from the link will
be used in the local refinery, which will also be upgraded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
