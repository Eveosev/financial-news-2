The  gasoline   crack , or premium to
 Brent crude , rose to the highest in more than a week.  Hedge
funds  and other money managers raised bullish bets on ICE gasoil
by 3,682 contracts in the week ended March 6,  data from ICE
Futures Europe  showed.  Mabanaft GmbH , the oil-trading unit of Marquard & Bahls AG,
will exit international business in Houston and Rotterdam and
focus on retail fuel and bunker markets, the company said.  Light Products  Gasoline (MOGEEURB)  for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp was bid at $1,112 and offered at $1,117 a metric ton
with no trades, according to a survey of brokers and traders
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with trades
on March 9 at $1,118 to $1,124.  “U.S. gasoline demand remains in the doldrums and any
tightness in supply could easily be countered by higher gasoline
inflows from  Europe  or rising refinery utilisation in the
U.S.,” Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy GmbH said today in
an e-mailed report.  The fuel’s crack was at $11.16 a barrel, up from $10.80 on
March 9, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
London-based broker. That’s the highest since March 3.  Naphtha’s  crack , or discount to Brent, narrowed to $5.44 a
barrel from $5.60 in the previous session, PVM data showed.  Middle Distillates  Net-long managed-money bets on ICE gasoil futures and
options rose to 82,641 lots last week from 78,959 the week
before, according to the ICE report.  The March gasoil contract on the ICE exchange in London
expired today at $1,023.50 a ton. That’s down from $1,033.75 in
the previous session.  Gasoil for April dropped $14, or 1.4 percent, to $1,022.75
a ton as of 1:05 p.m.  London  time. The May contract was at
$1,024.50.  The gasoil  crack , a measure of refining profitability, was
little changed at $12.99 a barrel. Brent dropped 1.3 percent to
$124.33 a barrel.  Companies  Mabanaft said in a  statement  on its website that it will
end international trading in Houston and Rotterdam because of
“significant changes in the market place and the associated
incompatibility of this business with the company’s conservative
approach to risk-taking.”  Marquard & Bahls, based in Hamburg, will retain its carbon-
credit business in Rotterdam and its Singapore trading office,
it said. The closely held group earned 112 million euros ($147
million) from operational activities before tax last year,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
