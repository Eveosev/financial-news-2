Britons’  concern  about losing their
jobs eased for a second month in February, according to Lloyds
Bank Corporate Markets.  An index of  job security  rose 2 points to minus 22 from
January, the unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc said in an e-
mailed report in London today. That’s still “significantly
weaker” than the average seen in the two years through 2007,
before the financial crisis, the bank said.  “Consumers’ sense of their economic wellbeing has risen
since the end of 2011 when the euro-area sovereign debt crisis
threatened to spill over into the European banking system and
the wider economy,” Lloyds economists Hann-Ju Ho and Jonathan Thomas wrote in the report. “However, the improvement in the
labor market indicators should be seen in the historical
context.”  The survey of 2,012 U.K. consumers between Feb. 17 and Feb.
26 also found a measure of their  price  expectations rose 2
points to 61 last month, the first increase since July, Lloyds
said. Still, it remains below readings seen in 2011, reflecting
the economic slowdown, according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
