Tudou Holdings Ltd. (TUDO)  soared to a
record in New York, driving gains in Chinese U.S.-listed
Internet shares, on plans by  Youku (YOKU)  Inc. to acquire the nation’s
second-largest video sharing website in a $1 billion deal.  Tudou surged as much as 178 percent to a record-high $42.81
in U.S. trading, while Youku, owner of China’s biggest online
video site, jumped the most in eight months. Online book
retailer  E-commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  climbed to a three-week
high and social networking website Renren Inc. posted the
biggest one-day advance in two weeks. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. gained 0.3
percent to a one-week high of 104.52 in New York.  Beijing-based Youku plans to acquire smaller competitor
Tudou in a $1 billion stock swap deal, the two companies said in
a joint statement yesterday. The deal values Tudou at $39.89 per
American depositary receipt, compared with its $15.39 closing
price on March 9. As Internet users climb in  China , the world’s
fastest-growing major economy, online video providers have had
to boost spending to lure viewers amid rising competition. Youku
reported a fourth-quarter net loss yesterday.  “This merger was inevitable,” Tian X Hou, founder and
senior analyst at T.H. Capital LLC, said by phone in New York
yesterday. “If there’s no consolidation then the end of the
story would be everybody goes bankrupt after our study on their
business revenue models. No one can afford the long-lasting cash
burn on content competition, bandwidth and traffic.”  Youku Net Loss  Holders of Tudou’s ADRs will receive 1.595 ADRs of Youku
for each Tudou ADR they own, the two companies said. When the
transaction is completed, Youku shareholders will own 71.5
percent of the new company, which will be named Youku Tudou
Inc., according to the statement. The proposed deal requires the
approval of shareholders and is expected to complete in the
third quarter.  Tudou’s ADRs surged 157 percent to $39.48, the highest
level since its August initial public offering in  New York . Each
ADR represents four common shares in the Shanghai-based company.
Youku jumped 27 percent to $31.85, the biggest daily gain since
June 28 and the highest price in seven months.  Youku incurred a net loss of 49.6 million yuan ($7.9
million) in the fourth quarter of 2011, widening by 32 percent
from a year ago, according to a separate statement yesterday.
Bandwidth costs rose to 109.7 million yuan, or 35 percent of
sales, from 34 percent a year ago, the company said. Content
costs were 20 percent of revenue in the quarter, up from 17
percent in the same period of 2010.  ‘Much Stronger Player’  Youku expects to have synergies of between $50 million to
$60 million a year after the deal with Tudou, Senior Vice
President Michael Xu said during a conference call yesterday.  “Together they are a much stronger player in the industry
against others,” T.H. Capital’s Hou said. “Strategically, the
merger is good for both companies.”  Eric Wen, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities  Hong Kong 
Ltd. raised his 12-month price target for Youku to $35.50 from
$31.50 yesterday. Wen recommends investors buy the shares.  “The merger will also likely play well with advertisers
given the perceived strength in market leadership and
sustainability of the combined company,” Andy Yeung, a New
York-based analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said in a research note
yesterday.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 0.5 percent to $38.83,
falling for the first time in four days. The  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  was little changed at 1,371.09.  Dangdang, Renren  ADRs of E-Commerce, China’s biggest Internet-based book
seller known as Dangdang, gained 7.1 percent to a three-week
high of $6.93. Beijing-based Renren climbed 3.9 percent to
$5.61, the largest daily advance since Feb. 28.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.2 percent to
2,434.86 yesterday while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
for Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong fell 0.3 percent to
11,225.91.  China Telecom Corp. (CHA) , the nation’s third-largest wireless
network operator, slid 1.3 percent to a three-week low of $57.38
in New York. The company’s ADRs, each representing 100 common
shares, traded 0.5 percent  above  its Hong Kong stock, narrowing
from a 0.9 percent premium on March 9. The shares slipped 0.9
percent to HK$4.43 in Hong Kong yesterday, the equivalent of 57
U.S. cents.  Sina Corp. -- provider of the Twitter-like Weibo service in
China, and which owns a 9.05 percent stake in Tudou -- fell 3.5
percent to $74.69.  Sina Slides  “Sina should have a capital gain from Tudou’s price
premium in the deal, while it also means it will likely face
stiffer competition on its online videos after Tudou’s
acquisition by Youku,” Echo He, a senior analyst covering
Chinese Internet stocks at Maxim Group LLC in New York, said
yesterday by phone.  China’s customs bureau reported on March 10 a $31.5 billion
 trade deficit  for February, the first in a year and four times
the size of the previous largest shortfall. Exports rose 18.4
percent from a year earlier, while imports gained 39.6 percent,
the agency said.  The People’s Bank of China weakened its daily fixing rate
for the yuan by the most since August 2010 after the trade
figures, as Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said the  exchange rate  is
linked to the balance of payments.  The yuan declined 0.3 percent to 6.3265 per dollar in
 Shanghai  yesterday, the biggest one-day loss since Jan. 20,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  To contact the reporter on this story:
