Childhood leukemia, once considered
a death sentence, is now curable in nine out of 10 children,
according to a study.  Five-year survival rates for children diagnosed with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, the most-common type in the young, rose
to 90 percent in the years 2000 to 2005 from 84 percent in 1990
to 1994, according to research today in the  Journal of Clinical
Oncology . Survival increased for all groups of children, except
for infants 1-years-old and younger, the study said.  Improved drug combinations and better ways to determine
treatment needs helped boost survival, researchers said.
Identifying subsets of leukemia and medications, such as
 Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Gleevec that specifically target those groups will
help improve survival even more, the authors wrote.  “This was a disease that was incurable in the early 1960s
and now 85 to 90 percent of children will be cured. That’s a
pretty big advancement in that time,” said lead study author
 Stephen Hunger , a professor of pediatrics at the  University of
Colorado  School of Medicine and director of the Center for
Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children’s Hospital Colorado in
Aurora, in a March 9 telephone interview. “The bad thing about
it is we can’t cure 10 percent and that’s what we have to focus
on.”  The vast majority of leukemias in children are acute, or
rapidly developing forms. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL,
accounts for about 3 out of 4 cases of the blood cancer among
children and teenagers. Most of the remaining cases are acute
myelogenous leukemia, or AML, according to the  American Cancer
Society .  Long-Term Survival  About 12,060 new  cases  of cancer are expected to occur in
children 14 years and younger this year, according to the
 American Cancer Society . About 34 percent of those are leukemia.  The researchers analyzed long-term survival among 21,626
people who were treated for leukemia as children in Clinical
Oncology Group trials between 1990 and 2005. The Clinical
Oncology Group includes more than 200 institutions in the U.S.,
Canada, Australia and  New Zealand   They found that 10-year survival rose to almost 84 percent
in 1995 to 1999 from 80 percent in 1990 to 1994. Survival also
improved for almost all groups including older children and
black children, the study showed.  “Childhood ALL is highly curable in 2012. Participation in
these clinical trials is what has allowed us to improve the
overall survival and cure rates for these kids,” said  ZoAnn E.
Dreyer , a pediatric oncologist at Texas Children’s Cancer Center
in Houston and a member of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology’s Cancer Communications Committee, who was not an
author on today’s paper. “Children who are treated 10 years
ago, their outcomes definitely help us contribute to the
outcomes of those treated today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
