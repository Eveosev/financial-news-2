French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ,
who’s running for re-election, said he would change the rules
for endorsing presidential candidates for the next elections due
in 2017 if he wins this year’s ballot.  The French people, and not the nation’s mayors, will chose
and endorse the candidates who can run in presidential
elections, Sarkozy said today in a televised interview on TF1.  Under  France ’s current electoral system, each candidate who
wants to run in the elections needs the backing of 500 mayors
who have to make their endorsement public. The system has been
criticized by all the candidates running in this year’s race.  France’s two-round presidential elections will be held on
April 22 and May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
