Gold dropped below $1,700 an ounce,
alongside other commodities, on concern that a slowdown in  China 
may crimp demand for raw materials.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
 slumped  as much as 1.2 percent as the world’s second-largest
economy had the biggest trade deficit last month in at least 22
years, the weakest January-February factory-production gain
since 2009 and retail sales in the first two months of the year
below the median economist estimate, according to government
data.  “All commodities, including gold, have taken a hit because
of China,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision
Financial Markets in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for April delivery declined 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,699.80 at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Prices jumped 2.4 percent in the previous three sessions. The
precious metal has climbed 8.5 percent this year.  Managed-money firms cut net-long positions in gold futures
and options by 26 percent to 145,997 contracts in the week ended
March 6, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data. That’s the biggest reduction since August 2008.  The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee, which sets
interest-rate policy, meets tomorrow.  “Market sentiment remains shaky,”  Tobias Merath , head of
commodity research at Credit Suisse Group AG’s private-banking
unit, said in a report today. “This week’s FOMC meeting will be
the next key event.”  Silver futures for May delivery fell 2.3 percent to $33.413
an ounce in New York. The metal slid 0.9 percent last week, the
second straight drop.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery slumped 0.8 percent to $704.25 an ounce. Platinum
futures for April delivery advanced 0.6 percent to $1,695.70 an
ounce, rising for the fourth straight session, the longest
winning streak since Feb. 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
