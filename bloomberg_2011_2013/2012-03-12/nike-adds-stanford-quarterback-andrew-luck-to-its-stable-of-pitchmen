Nike Inc. (NKE)  added top National
Football League draft prospect  Andrew Luck  to its stable of
product endorsers.  The  Indianapolis Colts  have said they’ll select Stanford
University quarterback Luck with the top pick in the April 26
draft. The Colts released 35-year-old quarterback  Peyton Manning 
on March 7. Manning, who won a Super Bowl title and four league
Most Valuable Player awards in 14 years with the Colts, sat out
last season after undergoing neck surgeries.  Manning’s move to a new team and Luck’s arrival in the
league may be a boost for Nike, the biggest sporting goods
maker, which takes over from  Reebok International Ltd. (RBK)  next
month as the maker of NFL-branded apparel and uniforms.
Manning’s No. 18 jersey has been among the NFL’s top 10 sellers
since 2004.  “I look forward to pursuing the next chapter of my career
with such an innovative company supporting me,” Luck, 22, said
in a statement last night on the website of Beaverton, Oregon-
based Nike, which didn’t reveal details of the deal.  Luck, who was runner-up the past two years for the Heisman
Trophy, guided Stanford to an 11-1 record and passed for 3,170
yards and 35 touchdowns last season.  Former Baylor University quarterback Robert Griffin III,
who won the Heisman Trophy in December, is expected to be picked
second in the draft. The Washington Redskins three days ago
announced that they’d agreed to give the St. Louis Rams three
first-round selections in exchange for the second pick in the
draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
