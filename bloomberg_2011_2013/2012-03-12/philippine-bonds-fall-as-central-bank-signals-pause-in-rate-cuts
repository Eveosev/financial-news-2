Philippine bonds declined after the
central bank signaled it will hold off from adding to this
year’s two interest-rate cuts as higher oil costs pose a risk to
inflation. The peso dropped.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said
March 10 that “high  oil prices  bear close watching.” Crude oil
climbed 8 percent to $106.74 a barrel this year in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Philippine policy
makers reduced the overnight borrowing rate by a quarter of a
percentage point at each of the last two reviews, lowering it to
4 percent, the least in a year.  “There is some likelihood that  interest rates  will be
pressured to go up,” said Antonio Espedido, treasurer at  China
Banking Corp. (CHIB)  in Manila. “The market will have to evaluate the
risks in view of the inflation outlook.”  The yield on the 5.875 percent debt due January 2018 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.65 percent as
of 2:06 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial
Services. The peso slid 0.2 percent to 42.658 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  Consumer prices in the Philippines, which imports most of
its energy needs, rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier in
February, the smallest increase since September 2009.  The nation’s debt-to-gross domestic product ratio will
likely continue to decline, which is “credit positive,”
Moody’s Investors Service said in e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
