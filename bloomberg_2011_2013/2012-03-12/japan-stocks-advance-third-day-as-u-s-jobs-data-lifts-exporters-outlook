Japanese stocks erased earlier
gains, ending a two-day rally, after  China  posted its largest
trade deficit in more than two decades and the yen rebounded
from a 10-month low against the dollar, damping the earnings
outlook for exporters.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction machinery maker whose biggest
market is China, dropped 1.8 percent.  Nippon Paper Group Inc. (3893) 
paced losses among paper companies after a report that wholesale
prices of some high-quality paper declined. Energy explorer
 Inpex Corp. (1662)  led mining companies higher after oil and metals
prices gained on March 9.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.4 percent to 9,889.86
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo  after earlier rising above 10,000.
The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost 0.4 percent to 845.28 after adding
1.3 percent last week. Stocks gained earlier after U.S. jobs
data beat estimates last week.  “The Nikkei may lack momentum to extend gains beyond
10,000,” said Takeru Ogihara, chief strategist in Tokyo at
Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest
lender by market value. “ Europe ’s economy is contracting and
China’s economic fundamentals remain dicey with exports being so
weak.”  U.S. Jobs Data  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.4 percent
today. The gauge rose 0.4 percent in  New York  on March 9 after a
227,000 increase in payrolls last month topped the median
projection of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  China posted its largest trade deficit since at least 1989
last month as Europe’s sovereign-debt turmoil damped exports and
imports rebounded after the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, the
government reported on March 10.  Komatsu slid 1.8 percent to 2,320 yen, and  Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co (6305) , a Japanese machinery maker that
generates 27 percent of its sales in China, advanced 0.2 percent
to 1,781 yen after rising as much as 2.5 percent earlier. A
Japanese government report today showed machinery orders gained
3.4 percent in January after falling 7.1 percent in December.  The yen rose against all of its major counterparts today,
strengthening to as much as 82.11 against the dollar, after
touching 82.65 on March 9, the lowest since April 27. A stronger
yen cuts overseas earnings at Japanese companies.  Exporters Fall  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 80 percent of its
revenue overseas, lost 1.5 percent to 3,705 yen.  Nintendo Co. (7974) ,
the world’s biggest maker of video-game consoles, fell 1.2
percent to 11,540 yen.  Paper companies dropped the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups after the Nikkei newspaper reported the
wholesale price of high-quality light coated paper fell for the
first time in a year and half. Nippon Paper lost 4.7 percent to
1,812 yen, and  Daio Paper Corp. (3880)  dropped 1.4 percent to 548 yen.  The  Topix (TPX)  has gained 10 percent since March 15 last year,
when the measure plunged four days after the record earthquake
and tsunami struck  Japan ’s northeast and caused a nuclear
disaster. The gain, buoyed by global monetary easing and
reconstruction demand, boosted the value of shares on the index
to 1.23 times book value, compared with 1.12 in March 2011.  Bank of Japan  The  Bank of Japan  is starting two-day meeting at which it’s
expected to keep  interest rates  unchanged, according to 12 of 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The central bank on Feb.
14 surprised the market by increasing its government bond
purchase program and setting an inflation goal of 1 percent,
weakening the yen and boosting stocks.  The  Federal Reserve  is set start a two-day policy meeting
today. The Wall Street Journal last week reported the Fed is
considering a strategy that would allow it to undertake another
round of bond buying, while lowering the risk of inflation.  Mining companies rose after the London Metal Exchange Index
of prices for six industrial metals including copper and
aluminum rose 1.9 percent on March 9. Oil rose to a one-week
high on the same day.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer, advanced 1.1
percent to 564,000 yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. climbed
2.9 percent to 4,090 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 3.9 percent to 22.94,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 7 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the
Nikkei was 29 percent above its 100-day average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Japanese market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after

fibers, rose 0.9 percent to 1,210 yen. Its operating profit will
likely top 60 billion yen, beating its forecast for a record 57
billion yen, for the year ending March 31, Nikkei newspaper
reported.  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  (6752 JT), an electronics company, gained
0.7 percent to 740 yen. It said it plans to boost sales of
