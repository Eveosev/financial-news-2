Gulf Coast  conventional gasoline
for prompt delivery weakened for a second day while the fuel was
unchanged in  New York  Harbor.  The discount to April gasoline futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  for Gulf 87-grade gasoline widened 0.5 cent
to 18.5 cents a gallon at 3:53 p.m., according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The prompt-delivery price fell 1.44 cents to
$3.138 a gallon.  In New York, the fuel held steady at a 23.5-cent discount.
There was less trading today because of the American Fuel &
Petrochemical Manufacturers conference in San Diego, said Steve
Mosby, vice president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in
Kansas City, Missouri.  Colonial Pipeline Co. plans to expand its Line 3 by 125,000
barrels a day, Dave Doudna, the companyâ€™s director of business
development and optimization, told reporters at the conference.
The first phase would boost capacity 60,000 barrels a day by
mid-2013, with a second expansion of 65,000 barrels expected by
2014, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
