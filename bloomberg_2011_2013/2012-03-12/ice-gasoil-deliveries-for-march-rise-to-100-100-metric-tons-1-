The amount of benchmark 0.1 percent

data from the Intercontinental Exchange Inc.  That compares with 46,100 tons in February and 554,600 tons
in March last year, which was a record. The contract expired
today at midday London time at $1,023.50 a ton.  The number of deliveries for low-sulfur gasoil fell to
14,800 tons, compared with 20,800 tons in February. This is the
