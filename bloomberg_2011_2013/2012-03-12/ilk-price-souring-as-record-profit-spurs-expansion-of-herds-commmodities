Record dairy profits and milder
weather are leading to a surge in milk supplies from Auckland to
 California , turning last year’s best-performing commodity
contract into one of the worst of 2012.  Output in the U.S., the world’s largest producer, will
advance 1.8 percent to a record 199.7 billion pounds (90.6
million metric tons) in 2012, the Department of Agriculture
estimates. Futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
already fell 29 percent from a four-year high in August and may
drop another 8 percent to $14.25 per 100 pounds by July, the
median of six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  An estimated 30 percent jump in U.S. dairy exports led to
the most profitable year ever for farmers, who expanded  herds 
that now are the biggest since May 2009, USDA data show. Yields
reached a record during an unusually mild winter. Supply is also
rising in  Australia  and New Zealand, the largest exporter, and
dairy was the only food cost tracked by the  United Nations  to
decline last month.  “This blasted weather that most people have enjoyed, the
dairy cows have really enjoyed it,” said  Bill Brooks , an
economist for INTL FCStone Inc. in  Kansas City , who grew up on a
dairy farm in  Missouri  and has covered the industry for two
decades. “We’re going to see more milk production.”  Agriculture Index  Milk futures that jumped 31 percent last year, more than
any of the 24 commodities in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index, dropped 10 percent since Dec. 30 to close at $15.49 at
1:10 p.m. in  Chicago . Only natural gas and arabica coffee fell
more. The S&P GSCI Agriculture Index advanced 1.4 percent this
year, as the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose 11
percent. Treasuries lost 0.5 percent, a Bank of America Corp.
index shows.  U.S. dairy farmers had 9.236 million cows in January, the
14th herd expansion in 16 months, USDA data show. Each animal
 produced  a record 21,345 pounds (9.7 metric tons) of milk last
year. Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the largest dairy
exporter, shipped 246,000 tons in December, the most ever.
Deliveries to its plants rose 9.8 percent in the eight months
ended Jan. 31, the Auckland-based company said last month.  Rising supply may meet weaker gains in demand. China, the
biggest buyer of U.S. agricultural products, is targeting
economic growth of 7.5 percent, the lowest since 2004, Premier
 Wen Jiabao  said March 5. The economy gained 8.9 percent in the
fourth quarter, the slowest pace in 10 quarters.  Feed Costs  Declining milk prices and rising cattle-feed costs may
require farmers to cull herds, reducing supply, said Chip Whalen, a vice president of education and research at Chicago-
based Commodity & Ingredient Hedging LLC, which advises clients
on managing commodity price swings. Corn futures averaged $6.78
a bushel in Chicago last year, the most in at least a half
century. Record beef prices also may encourage more
slaughtering.  “We’re going to go through another one of these cycles
where we’re going to cull the herd,” said  Shawn Hackett , the
president of Hackett Financial Advisers Inc., a brokerage and
consultant based in  Boynton Beach ,  Florida . “We’re setting a
stage for a significant slowdown in production growth, starting
in the later part of this year,” said Hackett, who anticipates
a rally to $18 in the second half of 2012.  While  China  may slow this year, the U.S. will expand 2.2
percent from 1.7 percent in 2011, according to the median of 79
economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. consumption of
fluid milk will reach 28.61 million tons this year, the highest
since at least 1964, and cheese demand will advance to 4.83
million tons, the most since at least 1965, USDA data show. The
U.S., with 4.5 percent of the global population, eats 32 percent
of the world’s cheese production and drinks 6.2 percent of its
milk, the department estimates.  Cull Herds  Farmers may be reluctant to cull herds. While losses this
year may hurt some dairies, most are in better financial shape
than in 2009 and 2010, so there won’t be a “wholesale decrease
in cow numbers,” said Jon Spainhour, a broker and partner at
Rice Dairy LLC in Chicago.  In 2009, the average for milk futures slumped to $11.56, a
six-year low, before rebounding in 2011 to $18.55. Last year,
the average dairy farm had net cash income of $239,800, the most
ever, the USDA estimated Feb. 13, up from $158,100 in 2010 and
$70,100 in 2009.  Exports were the “key factor” in last year’s rally, said
Bob Cropp, an economist at the  University of Wisconsin  in
Madison who has been studying the industry since 1966. U.S.
dairy exports totaled $4.78 billion in 2011, up from $3.69
billion in 2010, according to the USDA’s  Foreign Agricultural
Service . Shipments will drop 2.2 percent in 2012, according to a
report by USDA economist Milton Madison at a Feb. 24 forum in
 Washington .  Industry Projects  The industry is now facing more competition in export
markets, said Brooks of INTL FCStone. Output in  New Zealand ,
curbed by drought last year, may rise 8 percent to 10 percent
this season, according to Southbank, Australia-based Dairy
Australia, which raises levies from farmers to fund industry
projects.  Production in Australia may rise 1.4 percent to 9.55
billion liters (2.5 billion gallons) in the year beginning July
1, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
and Sciences said in a report March 6. Flooding last year
limited output and disrupted transportation.  U.S. output is also rising on improving weather. The three-
month period ended in January was the sixth-warmest-ever for
that time of year, according to Brad Rippey, a meteorologist
with the USDA. The four warmest all happened since 1998 and the
other was in 1933-1934, the dust bowl era.  California Dairies  Milk production in California, the largest producing state,
climbed 6.6 percent in January from a year earlier to 3.615
billion pounds, the highest on record for that month, USDA  data 
show. There’s “milk coming out of our ears,” said Bill Schiek,
an economist at the Dairy Institute of California in  Sacramento ,
which represents processors in the state.  The drop in prices is no incentive to cut production for
Ray Souza, who has 900 Holstein cows on his farm in Turlock,
California. Farmers tend to react by increasing output because
their costs remain similar, he said.  “We’ve never produced at this level before,” said the 65-
year-old, who has been in the dairy business since 1973. “Cows
produce more milk in the springtime than they do in any other
part of the year. This spring seems to have started around the
first of December.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
