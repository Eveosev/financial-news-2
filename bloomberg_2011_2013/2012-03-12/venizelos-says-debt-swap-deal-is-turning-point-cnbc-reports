Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos told CNBC the completion of a debt swap was a “new
starting point” for  Greece  and the triggering of credit default
swaps was a technicality that will not affect the country’s
economy.  “The  credit event  and triggering of the CDS is something
internal,” Venizelos said in an interview. “This is a kind of
dealing room between banks and financial entities. It’s not
something important for us as a real economy.”  Venizelos also said the country will not require a third
bailout package.  To contact the reporter on this story:
