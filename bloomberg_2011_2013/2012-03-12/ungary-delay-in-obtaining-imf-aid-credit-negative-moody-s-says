Hungary ’s failure to obtain a
European Union and  International Monetary Fund  loan four months
after requesting assistance is credit negative, Moody’s
Investors Service said.  The absence of a loan makes external borrowing
“challenging” for the country and rising costs on domestic
bond sales “pose questions for debt sustainability,” Alpona
Banerji, a Moody’s analyst in  London , said in a report today.  Hungary is seeking to quell investor concern that it isn’t
committed to an IMF deal after the European Commission, the EU’s
executive arm, said March 7 that the government failed to meet
preconditions for the start of talks as the forint dropped to a
record and the country’s sovereign-credit rating was cut to
junk. Hungary’s total borrowing needs this year may equal about
15 billion euros ($20 billion), or 16 percent of gross domestic
product, the highest in central and eastern  Europe , Moody’s
said, citing its estimate.  The standoff between Hungary and the European Commission
“is delaying negotiations on a much-needed support package from
the  International Monetary Fund  and the EU, which is credit
negative for Hungary,” Moody’s said.  The European Commission last week took a formal step toward
seeking a court order to require Hungary to redraft laws on the
judiciary and data-protection agency and asked for more
information on planned changes to a new central bank law.  “The increasing cost of borrowings and fragile investor
confidence underscore the necessity of an external support
program for Hungary,” said Moody’s, which rates Hungary’s
sovereign credit Ba1, the highest non-investment grade, with a
negative outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
