FuelCell Energy Inc., (FCEL)  a U.S.
manufacturer of fuel-cell power plants, jumped the most in more
than two weeks after the world’s third-largest steelmaker agreed
to increase its stake and placed the company’s biggest order.  FuelCell climbed 7.3 percent to $1.61 a share at the close
in  New York , the most since Feb. 22. The shares have gained 85
percent this year.  South Korea’s Posco will pay $30 million for 20 million
shares of FuelCell and agreed to buy 120 megawatts of power
plants, Danbury, Connecticut-based FuelCell said today in a
statement. FuelCell will also accelerate deliveries on Posco’s
previous 70-megawatt order.  “It provides a consistent level of production for many
years,” FuelCell’s Chief Executive Officer Chip Bottone said
today on a conference call with analysts and investors. “This
certainty of demand facilitates manufacturing efficiencies.”  The companies expect to complete the share purchase in
April, giving  Posco (005490)  a 22 percent stake in FuelCell. Posco
currently owns 10.8 million shares and is its largest holder.
All of the systems will be produced at FuelCell’s factory in
Torrington,  Connecticut .  For its first fiscal quarter ending Jan. 31, FuelCell today
reported a loss of $6.7 million, or 5 cents a share, narrower
than a loss of $11.7 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier. Sales
climbed 12 percent to $31.3 million.  FuelCell, which hasn’t reported an annual  profit  since
1997, has lost more than $718 million million over the past
decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  FuelCell’s systems produce electricity from natural gas or
biogas, methane produced through wastewater treatment,  food
processing  and other renewable sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
