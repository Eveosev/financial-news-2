New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the Czech
Republic’s biggest coking-coal producer, fell for a second day
as commodities declined after Chinese exports missed estimates.  The stock slid 0.7 percent to 145 koruna by 1:16 p.m. in
Prague, adding to a 0.4 percent loss in the previous session and
extending NWR’s decline this month to 8.5 percent.  Europe ’s benchmark  coal  derivatives retreated 0.7 percent
to $113.2 a metric ton in the Netherlands. Oil and copper fell
after a March 10 report showed exports from the world’s second-
largest economy rose 18 percent last month from a year earlier,
missing a 31 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
