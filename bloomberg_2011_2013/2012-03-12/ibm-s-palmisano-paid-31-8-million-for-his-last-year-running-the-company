International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  paid Sam Palmisano $31.8 million in 2011, his last year as
chief executive officer before he was succeeded by Virginia “Ginni” Rometty in January.  Palmisano’s pay is little changed from the $31.7 million he
earned in 2010, according to a  regulatory filing  today. Annual
compensation includes salary, bonus, stock awards and options.
Rometty earned $8.34 million last year, when she was head of
sales and marketing, up from $6.4 million in 2010.  Palmisano, 60, boosted earnings during his tenure by
focusing on software and services and selling off assets
including the company’s personal-computer business. He was
Armonk, New York-based IBM’s longest-serving CEO who doesn’t
share the surname of the company’s founder, Thomas J. Watson.
Palmisano remains IBM’s chairman.  Rometty, 54, became the first female CEO in the company’s
100-year history when she succeededPalmisano, inheriting a
five-year plan that includes boosting software to half of IBM’s
earnings, with a focus on programs that help businesses analyze
and project trends, as well as on cloud computing and emerging
growth markets.  The world’s largest computer-services provider is “well on
track” to its goal of generating at least $20 a share in
operating earnings by 2015, up from $13.44 last year, Rometty
reiterated in the 2011  annual report  published over the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
