Frosts damaged more than 30 percent
of winter crops, mostly barley and rapeseed, in  Russia ’s
southern Krasnodar region, Interfax reported.  The area affected covers about 540,000 hectares (1.3
million acres), Interfax said, citing comments by Yevgeny
Gromyko, the region’s deputy governor, at an agricultural forum
today.  Krasnodar accounted for 12 percent of Russia’s total grain
harvest last year after farmers gathered 11.4 million metric
tons there, according to the state statistics service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
