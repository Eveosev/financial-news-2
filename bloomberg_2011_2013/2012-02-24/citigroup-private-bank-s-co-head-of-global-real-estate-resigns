Kwang Meng Quek, co-head of the
global real estate group at  Citigroup (C)  Inc.’s private banking
unit, resigned.  Adam Abdur Rahman, a Singapore-based spokesman for
Citigroup, confirmed the resignation. Quek will leave the bank
next month and a successor will be named shortly, Rahman said.
Quek, who is based in Hong Kong, couldn’t be reached at his
office phone or by e-mail for comment.  Quek has been with Citigroup since 1990, including 12 years
working for the corporate bank unit, according to a profile on
the website of National University of  Singapore , where he is an
instructor in the real estate department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
