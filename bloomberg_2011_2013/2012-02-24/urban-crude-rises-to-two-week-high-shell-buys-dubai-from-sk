Abu Dhabi ’s Murban crude rose to a
premium above its official selling price this week to close at
the highest level since Feb. 10.  Murban (PGCPMURB)  was up 1 cent to 3 cents over its OSP, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News. It was assessed at 13 cents
below on Feb. 20.  Lower Zakum (PGCPLWZK) , also produced by Abu Dhabi,
increased 1 cent to 3 cents below its OSP. That was the smallest
discount in two weeks.  Dubai (PGCRDUBA)  crude gained 75 cents to $121.52 a
barrel, the highest since Aug. 2008.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  bought four Dubai partial cargoes for
April from  South Korea ’s  SK Innovation Co. (096770) , according to a
survey of traders who monitor the Platts pricing window. The
European  oil company  paid $121.50 a barrel for two lots and
$121.55 a barrel for the other two. SK Innovation has sold at
least 30 of the 25,000 barrel parcels so far in February,
accounting for 750,000 barrels.  Dubai crude’s backwardation, when the price for prompt
deliveries is  greater  than for later shipments, was little
changed. Swaps for March were $1.80 cents a barrel more than in
May, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-
based broker. The price difference, known as a timespread, has
more than doubled since the start of the month, a sign of
stronger refiner demand for prompt oil.  The April  Brent-Dubai (PVMMDBSP)  exchange for swaps, which measures
the European benchmark contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
fell 6 cents to $3.87 a barrel, according to PVM data. The May
contract was also down 6 cents to $3.67.  Vietnam Tenders  PV Oil Co.,  Vietnam ’s state-owned oil-marketing company,
offered as much as 450,000 barrels of Rang Dong crude for April
to May loading, said three traders who participate in the market,
declining to be identified because the information is
confidential. The parcels are for April 3 to April 9 and April
25 to May 2 loading. Bids are due Feb. 29.  Oman futures for April delivery rose 84 cents to $122.74 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:47 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,648 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$122.72 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The refining  margin  in Singapore, or the theoretical profit
from processing a barrel of Dubai crude into fuels such as
gasoline and diesel, averaged $3.57 through Feb. 23, compared
with $4.83 for the last three months, Bloomberg data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
