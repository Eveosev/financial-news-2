KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper
producer with the biggest European mine output, jumped to a two-
week high as the metal advanced before a report that may show US
new homes sales rose to a nine-month high.  The stock, the best-performing company in the  WIG20 Index (WIG20) 
this year, climbed as much as 3.3 percent to 143.1 zloty, the
highest since Feb. 9. KGHM traded 3.25 percent higher at 143
zloty at 1:21 p.m. in Warsaw.  Purchases of new homes probably climbed 2.6 percent to a
315,000 annual pace, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 77 economists before a report due at 3
p.m. today.  Construction accounts for about 40 percent of demand for
the metal, according to the Copper Development Association. The
U.S is the second biggest metal buyer after  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
