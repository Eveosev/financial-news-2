Fitch Ratings cut  Commonwealth Bank
of Australia (CBA) ,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and  National Australia Bank
Ltd. (NAB)  by one level, citing their dependence on wholesale funding
markets that are “vulnerable to swings of confidence.”  The long-term issuer default rating on the three Australian
lenders was cut to AA- from AA, Fitch said in an e-mailed
statement today. It also reaffirmed the AA- rating of  Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)   Fitch’s moves follow similar downgrades by Moody’s
Investors Service in May, and Standard & Poor’s in December,
partly because of their reliance on offshore funding markets.
Australia’s so-called four pillar banks, so named for a law that
prevents them buying each other, derive about 40 percent of
their total funding from wholesale markets.  The downgrades “reflect the weaker funding profile of the
major Australian banks relative to similarly rated international
peers,” Fitch said in the statement. “Despite some improvement
since 2008, all four banks retain a reliance on wholesale
funding, particularly from offshore markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
