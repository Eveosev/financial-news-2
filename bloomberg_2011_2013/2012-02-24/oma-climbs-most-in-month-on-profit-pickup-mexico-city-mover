Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte
SAB , the operator of airports in northern Mexico, gained the
most in a month after fourth-quarter profit beat forecasts and
the company diversified its revenue.  The  shares  rose 4.9 percent to 26.79 pesos in Mexico City,
the biggest advance since Jan. 10. The benchmark  IPC index  of 35
Mexican stocks fell 0.2 percent. The  IRT Small (IRTSMALL)  Capitalization
index, of which the airport operator is a part, dropped 0.4
percent.  Net income for Oma, as the Apodaca, Mexico-based company is
known, climbed 26 percent to 231 million pesos ($17.9 million)
in the fourth quarter on 774 million pesos in sales, according
to a statement sent yesterday after markets closed. The figure
beat Banco Santander SA’s forecast for profit of 168 million
pesos. Non-aeronautical revenue, including renting restaurant
and car rental spaces in airports, increased 18 percent in the
period, adding to a pickup in terminal traffic.  “They’re diversifying their strategy so as not to depend
so much” on passenger flow, said Aldo Miranda, a trader at
Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA, which manages about 1 billion pesos
in equities. Intercam had forecast profit of 147 million pesos
on 700 million pesos of sales.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, a measure of profit known as Ebitda, rose 51
percent to 342 million pesos.  To contact the reporters on this story:
