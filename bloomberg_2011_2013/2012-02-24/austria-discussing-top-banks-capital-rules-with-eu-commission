Austria ’s regulators are discussing
rules for its top banks that will curb excessive lending in
eastern Europe with the European Commission, according th
Central Bank Governor Ewald Nowotny.  “We’ve entered into agreements with the regulators” of
the eastern European countries and “now still are in talks with
the European Commission,” Nowotny told reporters in Vienna
today, adding that the regulators didn’t want to publish the
rules without the commission’s consent. The discussions will be
completed “shortly,” he said.  Austria’s financial markets regulator and the central bank
in November presented a plan that restricts new loan business to
1.1 times the deposits and wholesale funding that  Raiffeisen
Bank International AG (RBI) ,  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , and  UniCredit (UCG)  Bank
Austria AG’s local units in eastern Europe are able to raise on
their own. They also brought forward capital rules from the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  The regulators have yet to publish a comprehensive version
of the rules, an action initially scheduled for the end of 2011.  “We are in no rush,” Nowotny said today. “The banks de
facto meet the rules already -- we’ve already achieved what we
set out to do as the banks have developed an increased awareness
of risk in their business models.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
