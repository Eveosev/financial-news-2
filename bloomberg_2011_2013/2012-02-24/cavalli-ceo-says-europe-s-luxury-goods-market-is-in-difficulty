Luxury goods  makers may struggle
this year in Europe as retailers reduce orders and local demand
wilts, according to Gianluca Brozzetti, chief executive officer
of fashion company Cavalli Group.  In general, the market for high-end goods “is clearly in
difficulty,” particularly in central and southern parts of the
region, Brozzetti said today before the Just Cavalli runway show
in Milan. Exceptions are cities popular with Chinese tourists
and department stores that have overhauled their outlets.  In Europe, third-party distributors are buying less as they
seek to shift inventory, while local shoppers have cut spending
in the past six months, said the CEO of Florence, Italy-based
Cavalli. “There’s a lot of hesitancy,” he said, echoing
comments by Patrizio di Marco, CEO of PPR SA-owned Gucci.  Sales of luxury goods may grow 4 percent in Europe this
year, excluding currency swings, estimates  Thomas Chauvet , an
analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London. The forecast “reflects a
combination of weak domestic demand largely offset by robust
tourist-driven demand,” Chauvet said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
