Life insurers must pay beneficiaries
the full amount of what is owed on policies and not hold the
money in their own accounts without their permission, the New
York Department of Financial Services said today.  “For years, the life insurance industry has been earning
hundreds of millions of dollars by holding life insurance
payouts of America’s soldiers, veterans, and others in so-called
retained asset accounts,”  Benjamin Lawsky , superintendent of
the department, said in a statement today. “ The accounts often
pay the beneficiaries a much smaller  interest rate  than they
could make by investing the funds themselves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
