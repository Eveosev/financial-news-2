Vietnam’s  benchmark five-year  bonds
rose by the most in almost two years as slowing inflation
bolstered speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates .
The dong was little changed.  Yields declined to an 11-month low as  consumer prices 
climbed 16.44 percent in February from a year earlier, the least
in 10 months, the General Statistics Office said in Hanoi today.
The central bank said last month it may reduce borrowing costs
to “more suitable” levels. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said in a Dec. 6 speech that the government expects the
pace of price increases to slow to about 9 percent in 2012.  “I would expect the refinancing rate to be cut by 50 or
100 basis points, sometime in March or April,” Fiachra MacCana,
managing director at Ho Chi Minh City Securities Corp., said.
“I don’t think a 10 percent inflation rate for the year is
realistic, but about 12 percent is. It will dip into single-
digits mid-year and then climb back out again.”  The  yield  on the five-year notes fell 34 basis points, or
0.34 percentage point, today to 11.91 percent, according to a
daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
biggest drop since March 4, 2010 and the lowest level since
March 30, 2011. The rate declined 32 basis points this week.  In February last year, the government released its so-
called Resolution 11 strategy to tame prices, restrain credit
growth and stabilize the currency. The  state bank  could cut
policy rates next month, Hong Kong-based HSBC Holdings Plc
economist Trinh Nguyen wrote in a note to clients today.  Dong Steady  Vietnam’s central bank raised several policy rates last
year as it sought to tackle the fastest inflation in  Asia . It
cut the repurchase rate for the seven-day term to 14 percent
from 15 percent on July 4, after increasing it in nine steps
from 7 percent at the start of November 2010. The monetary
authority also raised the refinancing rate from 8 percent to 15
percent between November 2010 and October last year, and boosted
the discount rate to 13 percent on May 1, after raising it from
7 percent to 12 percent on March 8.  The dong was little changed today and for the week at
20,840 per dollar as of 5:23 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The State Bank of  Vietnam 
fixed its daily reference  rate  at 20,828, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent
on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
