Nigeria’s crude and natural-gas
output fell 6 percent in the third quarter, according to state-
owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.  Average daily output fell to 2.38 million barrels, compared
with 2.53 million barrels a year earlier, the Abuja-based
company known as NNPC said today in a statement on its  website .  Gas output dropped to 600.25 billion standard cubic feet
from 636.66 billion during the same period. The West  Africa 
country flared 123.3 billion standard cubic feet of gas, or 21
percent of the total, NNPC said.  Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil producer. Royal Dutch Shell
Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Total SA and Eni SpA run
joint ventures with NNPC that pump most of the country’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
