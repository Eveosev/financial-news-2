U.S. wheat production may rise to
2.165 billion bushels, up from a five-year low of 1.999 billion
last year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  Farmers may yield 44.5 bushels per acre, the USDA said
today in a report released at its annual Outlook Forum in
Arlington, Virginia. U.S. plantings may total 58 million acres,
6.6 percent more than last year, the agency said yesterday.
Rising production may boost domestic inventories to 957 million
bushels before the harvest, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
