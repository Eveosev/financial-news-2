MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  rose in
extended trading after CNBC reported that  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) 
walked away from discussions for an $8 billion takeover of the
wireless company.  MetroPCS, based in Richardson, Texas, rose as much as 11
percent after the report said Sprint was close to a deal that
would have included a 30 percent premium. Sprint was little
changed after briefly rising to $2.52.  To contact the reporter on this story:
