Chinese stocks  traded in the U.S.
dropped last week, led by  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  and  E-
Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , as the slowing economy ate into
company profits and fraud concerns resurged.  Solar module maker Yingli had its biggest weekly slump
since November,  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , China’s fifth-biggest solar-
panel supplier, tumbled 19 percent, and E-commerce, an online
bookseller known as Dangdang, dropped for the third week this
month after all three companies reported worse-than-expected
earnings results. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-
Chinese stocks in the U.S. slid 1.3 percent to 107.48 last week.  China’s economy  grew at the  slowest pace  for 10 quarters in
the last three months of 2011, as  Europe ’s debt crisis eroded
demand for exports and contributed to easing sales for companies
like Dangdang, which reported a bigger-than-estimated net loss
in the period. In echoes of  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , a Chinese timber
company short sellers accused of overstating its assets last
year, two executives of U.S.-listed Chinese miner  Puda Coal Inc. (PUDA) 
were charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with
defrauding investors on Feb. 22.  “Chinese stock multiples will generally remain low,”
William Wells, chief executive officer at Memphis-based Pope
Asset Management LLC, which manages about $500 million including
investments in Chinese stocks, said on Feb. 24. “There will be
a lot of risk and opportunity until rule of law is better
established to protect the investors.”  Cheaper Than S&P  The China-US 55 Index has  gained  12 percent this year,
reversing an 8.3 percent decline in 2011, on prospects  China 
will further loosen monetary policy to bolster the economy. The
measure is  trading  at 12.7 times reported earnings, compared
with 14 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Yingli, a solar-panel maker based in Baoding city in
northern China, sank to a 2012-low after reporting on Feb. 22
that fourth-quarter shipments probably fell 30 percent from a
year ago, down from previous guidance for a “low to middle 20s
percent” decline. The company is  scheduled  to report results
for the fourth quarter before markets in New York open on Feb.
29.  Miller Tabak & CO LLC downgraded Yingli to “sell” from
“neutral,” lowering the 12-month price target to $2.  Chinese solar companies also declined in response to plans
by  Germany , the world’s biggest solar market, to cut aid to
the industry by as much as 29 percent from March 9, dimming the
sales outlook for manufacturers in China where the world’s three 
largest panel makers are based.  Net Loss  Trina, based in Changzhou in China’s eastern Jiangsu
province, sank 19 percent last week, the biggest weekly loss
since September, to a six-week low of $7.80 in  New York .  The company said on Feb. 23 that it incurred a net loss of
$65.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with net
income of $145.3 million in the same period a year earlier. The
average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for  a
loss of $30.9 million.  Wells Fargo Securities LLC   downgraded  Trina to “market
perform” from “outperform” while Susquehanna Financial Group
lowered its rating to “negative” from “neutral” on Feb. 24.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 0.2 percent to $40.16
last week and was little changed on Feb. 24. The  S&P 500 (SPX)  added
0.3 percent in the week to 1,365.74, the highest close since
June 2008.  Oil Surge  American depositary receipts of  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s largest
offshore oil explorer, declined for the first week in six,
dropping 3.3 percent last week to $225.25. The ADRs, each
representing 100 common shares, traded 1.1 percent higher than
 stock in Hong Kong , the largest premium since Feb. 1.  ADRs of  China Petroleum and Chemical Corp. ,  Asia ’s biggest
refiner known as Sinopec, dropped 0.9 percent to $113.04 on Feb.
24, extending the weekly loss to 6.3 percent, the biggest since
the week ended Aug. 5. Each ADR stands for 100 common shares.
 Crude oil  for April delivery jumped 1.8 percent on Feb. 24 to
$109.77 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement price since May 3.  Sinopec’s Shanghai-traded  stock  rose 0.3 percent last week
to 7.63 yuan, the equivalent of $1.21 per share.  The SEC charged Puda chairman Ming Zhao and former Chief
Executive Officer Liping Zhu, saying they defrauded investors
into believing they were investing in a Chinese coal business
when they were investing in an empty shell company, according to
the regulatory body’s statement on Feb. 22.  ‘Untouchable’  The chairman cheated U.S. investors by secretly
transferring control of the company’s sole source of revenue to
himself before selling shares to the public, securities
regulators alleged in a lawsuit filed Feb. 22 in federal court
in  Manhattan .  Allegations of fraud and asset embellishment from short
sellers including Muddy Waters LLC’s Carson Block have helped
shave more than $5 billion of market value from Chinese stocks.
U.S.-listed Chinese shares are “untouchable” because of the
taint of the fraud allegations, Daniel Arbess, a partner at
Perella Weinberg Partners LP in New York, said on Feb. 1.  Puda  traded  at 30 cents at the end of last week after
falling to as low as 20 cents on Feb. 23, down from as high as
$16.97 a share in December 2010.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed for the sixth week,
rising 3.5 percent to 2,439.63, the highest level since Nov. 17.  Dangdang, China’s biggest Internet-based book seller,  sank 
10 percent last week after reporting a net loss in the fourth
quarter widened from the previous three months as profit margin
shrank and marketing expenses rose amid competition. The decline
trimmed its advance this year to 44 percent.  Dangdang dropped 5 percent to $6.32 in New York on Feb. 24,
the lowest level since Jan. 17. Seven analysts  recommended  to
“hold” the stock, four rated it a “buy” while two ranked it
“sell,” according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
