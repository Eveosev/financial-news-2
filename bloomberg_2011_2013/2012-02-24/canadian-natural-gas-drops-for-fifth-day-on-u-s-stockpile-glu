Canadian natural gas fell for a
fifth session as a glut of supplies in the U.S. pared demand for
imports of the fuel.  Alberta  gas dropped 3.7 percent. U.S. stockpiles stood at
2.595 trillion cubic feet last week, 40 percent above the five-
year average, the  Energy Department (DOENUST5)  said yesterday. Canadian
stockpiles were 521.3 billion cubic feet, a gain of 97 percent
from last year, according to Canadian Enerdata. Most of the gas
produced in  Canada  is exported to the U.S.  “We’re just blowing the records right out of the
ballpark,” said Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at
INTL FCStone in St. Louis Park,  Minnesota . “If you look where
we’re at for storage this year for both Canada and the U.S.,
we’re setting records every week. We have so much natural gas
around.”  Alberta gas for March delivery declined 7.5 cents to C$1.94
a gigajoule ($1.84 per million British thermal units) at 3:40
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
has dropped 4.4 percent this week.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 7.1 cents to settle at $2.55 per million Btu. The
futures lost 5 percent this week.  Spot Prices  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
9.09 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $2.6885 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas declined 10.15 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $2.4776.
At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas was down 10.27 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $2.5861.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.8 billion cubic
feet, 25 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.77 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.11 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 597 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 2.06 billion cubic feet today, or 77 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.92
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
