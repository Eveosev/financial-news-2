Mauritius’s stocks retreated for a
fourth day, extending its weekly decline to the most in almost
three months after  Europe , its main trading partner, forecast a
contraction this year in the euro region economy.  The 38-member  SEMDEX index  fell 0.5 percent to 1,800.98 at
the close in Port Louis, the lowest since October 2010, widening
its five-day drop to 1.2 percent, the most since the week
through Dec. 2.  The European commission forecast yesterday a 0.3 percent
contraction for 2012 in the euro area, Mauritius’s biggest

Statistics Mauritius said today, with the  trade gap  widening 36
percent to 8.15 billion rupees. Tourism arrivals declined in
December and January, two months of the peak tourism season.  “We are caught in a downward spiral,” said Raj Tapesar,
managing director of  MCB Stockbrokers Ltd , in a phone interview
from the city. “We are witnessing an accumulation of bad news,
with no silver lining in the short term, prompting investors to

December dropped 8.3 percent to 944.65 million rupees ($32.63

14.4 million rupees in January, according to a Feb. 21 bulletin
of the Bank of Mauritius, down from 355.1 million rupees a year
