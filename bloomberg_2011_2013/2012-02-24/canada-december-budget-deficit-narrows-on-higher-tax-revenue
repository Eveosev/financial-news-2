Canada’s budget deficit narrowed in
December as revenue increased faster than spending, the finance
department said.  The shortfall declined to C$353 million ($354 million) from
C$1.35 billion a year earlier, the department said in its
monthly budget report from Ottawa today. The deficit in the
first nine months of the fiscal year that began April 1 shrank
to C$17.7 billion from C$27.4 billion the previous year.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  hasn’t yet set a date for
this year’s budget, and said yesterday that he doesn’t need an
“austerity” package to meet his goal of eliminating the
deficit by 2015-2016.  Revenue rose 6.8 percent to C$21.5 billion in December from
a year earlier, led by personal income taxes. Program spending
rose 2.7 percent to C$19.3 billion, the finance department said.
Public debt charges declined to C$2.56 billion from C$2.69
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
