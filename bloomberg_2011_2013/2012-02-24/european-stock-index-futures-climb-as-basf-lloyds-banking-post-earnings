European stocks  climbed, snapping a
three-day drop for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, as companies from
 Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  to Eiffage SA said they will cut their debt
in 2012 and house sales in the U.S. beat economists’ estimates.  Telecom Italia, the country’s biggest phone company,
advanced 6.8 percent. Eiffage jumped 16 percent after the
company also predicted higher profit.  SAP AG (SAP)  gained 1.5 percent
after announcing an 83 percent increase in its dividend. Cove
Energy Plc rallied after receiving an offer from  PTT Exploration
& Production Pcl (PTTEP)  for the company.  The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  rose 0.3 percent to 264.77 at the close of
trading. The gauge has still fallen 0.4 percent this week. The
gauge has  climbed 8.3 percent  so far this year buoyed by U.S.
economic reports that topped forecasts.  “European fourth-quarter earnings have been very mixed so
far,” said Ioan Smith, a director at Knight Capital Europe Ltd.
in London. “A very small percentage have beaten top- and
bottom-line estimates whilst offering better guidance. Given the
weak macro backdrop, it appears many have adopted conservative
stances.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in 13 of the 18
western-European markets.  Germany ’s DAX Index gained 0.8
percent, while  France ’s CAC 40 Index rose 0.6 percent. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index slipped 0.1 percent.  U.S. House Sales  A U.S. Commerce Department report showed that January new-
home sales reached 321,000, higher than the 315,000  median
estimate  of 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Ten companies on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  were scheduled to report
financial results today. Of the 212 that have reported quarterly
 earnings  so far, 108 have missed analyst estimates, while 92
have beaten them, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Telecom Italia jumped 6.8 percent to 86.7 euro cents after
the company forecast a bigger-than-estimated reduction of debt
this year, as well as stable earnings and revenue. Full-year
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
climbed 7.3 percent to 12.25 billion euros ($16.4 billion),
inline with analysts’ estimate of 12.3 billion euros.  Eiffage (FGR)  surged 16 percent to 29.51 euros after Chief
Executive Officer Pierre Berger said the French builder’s net
income and revenue will climb in 2012 as it improves the
operating margins at its contracting units. The company plans to
trim its debt by 2 billion euros in five years. Natixis upgraded
 the shares  to “buy” from “neutral.”  SAP Shares Climb  SAP advanced 1.5 percent to 50.29 euros, its highest price
since 2000, after the biggest maker of business-management
applications said its executive board has recommended an 83
percent increase of its  dividend  after a record year.  Part of the proposed 1.10 euro payout is a 35-cent one-off
dividend to mark SAP’s 40th anniversary, while the regular
dividend will increase by 25 percent. If approved, it would cost
1.3 billion euros, the company said late yesterday.  Cove Energy Plc (COV)  surged 21 percent to 235 pence after PTT
Exploration & Production offered 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8
billion) to buy the U.K. explorer focused on  East Africa ,
trumping an earlier bid by Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  The proposed offer of 220 pence a share represents a
premium of 30 percent to Cove’s average closing price in the
past five days,  Thailand ’s only listed oil and gas explorer said
today in a statement.  Lloyds, Brenntag Fall  Elsewhere,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  slid 2.3 percent to
35.73 pence, paring yesterday’s 3.3 percent advance. The shares
fell after the lender’s  full-year net loss  widened to 2.8
billion pounds from 320 million pounds for 2010 as the bank
compensated customers who were mis-sold loan insurance. That
fell short of the 2.41 billion-pound  median analyst estimate .  Brenntag AG (BNR)  retreated 3 percent to 84.15 euros after
Brachem Acquisition S.C.A. sold seven million shares in the
German chemical distributor, more than the five million that it
initially planned. Brachem sold the stock at 82.50 euros apiece.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  fell 2.2 percent to 247.3
pence after Canaccord Genuity and Singer Capital Markets sold
about 55 million shares in the  fund manager , two people familiar
with the sale said. The stock was offered at 240 pence apiece.  Bekaert NV plunged 8.7 percent to 24.72 euros for the
biggest decline on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP) . The world’s largest maker of
steel cord used in tires said planned cost cuts won’t restore
margins before 2014 following a collapse in sawing-wire prices
and increased competition from Asian manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
