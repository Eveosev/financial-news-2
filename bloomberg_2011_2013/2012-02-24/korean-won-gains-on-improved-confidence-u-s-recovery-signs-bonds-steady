South Korea’s won rose the most in a
week as upbeat economic data at home and in the U.S. spurred
demand for riskier assets, helping emerging markets attract
funds.  Government bonds  were little changed.  Domestic  consumer confidence  climbed to a three-month high
in February, central bank figures showed today. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  of U.S. stocks had its highest close since
May 2008 yesterday after better-than-estimated jobs and housing
data in the world’s biggest economy. The Kospi Index of shares
gained 0.6 percent as overseas investors bought $554.6 million
more of the nation’s shares than they sold this week through
yesterday. Crude oil rose 0.6 percent to $108.48 per barrel,
extending this year’s gain to 9.3 percent.  “Positive economic data in the U.S. and overseas stock
gains are supporting the won,” said Yun Se Min, a Seoul-based
currency dealer at Busan Bank in  Seoul . “Still, rising oil
prices may force South Korean oil companies to buy more dollars
to settle import bills, limiting won gains.”  The won advanced 0.3 percent to 1,125.80 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the
week, it was little changed.  Applications for jobless benefits in the U.S. were
unchanged in the week ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, the fewest since
March 2008 and less than the median 355,000 forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. A report from the Federal
Housing Finance Agency showed that a gauge of  home prices  jumped
0.7 percent in December, beating the 0.1 percent gain predicted
in a separate poll.  The yield on  South Korea ’s 3.5 percent debt due September
2016 was steady at 3.56 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. The rate fell two basis points this week. Three-year bond
futures declined 0.02 percent to 104.22 today and the one-year
interest-rate swap fell one basis point to 3.49 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
