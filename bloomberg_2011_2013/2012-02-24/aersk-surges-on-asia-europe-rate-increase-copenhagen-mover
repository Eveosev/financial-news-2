A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S (MAERSKB) , whose
container line transports the most  consumer goods  from  Asia  to
 Europe , surged in Copenhagen trading after the company said it
will raise rates for all dry reefer cargo from Asia to Europe.  Maersk rose as much as 4.2 percent, the most since Feb. 1,
making it today’s biggest gainer in the Copenhagen 20 Index. The
stock advanced 1,720 kroner, or 3.9 percent, to 46,240 kroner at
11:30 a.m. in the Danish capital.  Maersk’s container line, which has a market share of about
26 percent of the Asia-to-Europe route, is looking for ways to
stay profitable as it deals with overcapacity and flagging
consumer demand for imports in Europe. The company said today it
will raise freight rates for the Asia-to-Europe route by $400
per 20-foot container starting April 1.  “They’ve been able to push through more than $100 of the
price hike they announced a few weeks back, which indicates the
market is ready to accept higher prices,” said Nikolaj Kamedula, an analyst at SEB Enskilda in Copenhagen. Data from
the  Shanghai  Shipping Exchange show rates to ship a 20-foot
container from Shanghai to Northern Europe rose to $826 from
$711 a week ago, he said.  To help restore profits, Maersk said Jan. 31 it may double
freight rates on Asia-Europe trade. The company followed up with
a Feb. 17 announcement that it will cut 9 percent of its
capacity on the route.  To contact the reporter on this story:
