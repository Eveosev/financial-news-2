Coffee exports from  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of robusta beans, jumped 85 percent
last week from a year earlier, according to Volcafe, the coffee
unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Vietnamese coffee exports totaled 48,000 metric tons
between Feb. 13 and Feb. 17, the Winterthur, Switzerland-based
trader said in a report e-mailed today. Shipments were 26,000
tons in the same period last year, Volcafe said.  There were “enormous record-breaking post-Tet exports for
Vietnam last week,” Volcafe said. The Tet festival, which marks
the Lunar New Year, was Jan. 23 to Jan. 27.  Vietnam’s coffee exports fell 48 percent to 112,182 tons in
January from a year earlier, government data show. Farmers there
had been holding back beans waiting for higher prices, German
researcher F.O. Licht GmbH said in a report dated Feb. 22.  Coffee beans from the Southeast Asian nation were trading
at the same level as the price on the NYSE Liffe exchange, down
from a premium of $30 a pound last week, Volcafe data show.  Differentials “were looking to weaken faster, however,
some aggressive buying has hindered the expected adjustment,”
the trader said. Differentials correspond to a discount or a
premium paid to obtain physical coffee in relation to the
futures price.  Vietnam is the main supplier of robusta beans at this time
of year. The harvest in  Brazil , the second-biggest producer
of the variety, usually starts in July and the crop in third-
ranking Indonesia starts in April.  Robusta for May delivery climbed 0.8 percent to $2,035 a
ton by 12:46 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
