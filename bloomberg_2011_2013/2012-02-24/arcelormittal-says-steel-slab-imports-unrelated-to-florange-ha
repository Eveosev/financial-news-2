ArcelorMittal (MT)  said imports by the
Luxembourg-based company of steel slabs from Russian rival OAO
Severstal are unrelated to a decision to extend the idling of
its Florange factory in northeastern France.  “The imports have nothing to do with Florange,” the steel
company said by e-mail. “This was a very short-term situation
which was required on account of harsh winter conditions which
caused temporary loss of slab production at our own plants.”  Labor unions said the purchases showed the Florange site
should be restarted, Paris-based  Les Echos  reported today.  “This short-term requirement unfortunately did not support
the re-opening of any of our idled blast furnaces in  Europe ,”
ArcelorMittal said. “The economic reality means that an
extension of the temporary idling at Florange is required.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
