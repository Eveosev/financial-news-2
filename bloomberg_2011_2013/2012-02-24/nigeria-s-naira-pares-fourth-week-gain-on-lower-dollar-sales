Nigeria ’s naira advanced for a third
day, heading for a fourth weekly gain, supported by month-end
oil company dollar sales to fund local operations.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer climbed 0.4
percent to 156.4 per dollar as of 2:16 p.m. on the  interbank
market  in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The naira is up 0.7 percent on the dollar
this week.  “The usual month-end supply from the  oil companies  has
provided some level of support to naira demand in the market,”
Sewa Wusa, a currency analyst at Lagos-based Sterling Capital,
said by phone.  The Central Bank of Nigeria offers dollars at auctions on
Mondays and Wednesdays and through interbank trading to maintain
exchange-rate stability. The oil industry is the second major
source of dollar supplies in the country.  “Dollar availability is much improved thanks to strong
foreign exchange sales by the oil sector,” Gregory Kronsten and
Olubunmi Asaolu, research analysts at FBN Capital Ltd. in
 London , wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Ghana’s cedi gained 0.4 percent to 1.7045 per dollar, as of
1:17 p.m. in Accra, the nation’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
