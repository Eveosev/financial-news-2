The eastern U.S. may be warmer than
normal next week, with 10 to 30 percent less energy needed for
heating, while temperatures on the West Coast may drop.  From the Ohio Valley to southern  New England , temperatures
may be 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 3.3 Celsius) above normal
from Feb. 25 to March 2, according to David Salmon, owner of
Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  Along the West Coast, temperatures are expected to be about
2 degrees below normal, which may mean 30 percent more energy is
used to heat homes and businesses there during the period,
Salmon said in a note to clients.  Traders use long-range weather outlooks to gauge energy use
and demand for heating and cooling. Power plants consume about
30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to Energy
Department data.  The warmer weather in the East is expected to last longer
into March, according to  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  In his 6- to 10-day outlook, Rogers calls for temperatures
to be 3 to 5 degrees above normal in the East and be closer to
seasonal levels across much of the rest of the U.S.  The Northeast may become even warmer from March 5 to March
9, Rogers said in his 11- to 15-day outlook. Temperatures for
the region, along with eastern Canada, may be at least 8 degrees
above normal, he said.  For March 3, the normal average temperature in  New York
City  is about 39 degrees, according to  MDA EarthSat Weather  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston it’s 35; in  Chicago , 33; in
Houston, 60; in Dallas, 54; in Seattle, 45 and in Burbank,
 California , 57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
