Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  won’t approve the
812-million euro ($1.1 billion) damages payment to the heirs of
 Leo Kirch ,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported in a preview of an
article to be published tomorrow, citing an unidentified person
with knowledge of the company.  A payment this big can almost certainly be ruled out, the
newspaper cited the person as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
