One night in October 1969, President
 Richard Nixon , Attorney General  John Mitchell  and counsel John Ehrlichman went over to J. Edgar Hoover’s place for a manly
dinner.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  The  Federal Bureau of Investigation  chief served them
drinks in his living room, its dingy walls covered with glossy
photos of Hoover posing with dead movie stars.  After a meal of chili and steak, served in a dining room
lit by lava lamps burbling green, purple and red, they went for
after-dinner drinks to a basement decorated with posters of
naughty pin-ups.  All night the president and his men lapped up Hoover’s
tales of illegal FBI exploits, including secret bugging, late-
night entries and black-bag jobs.  Soon, the FBI was mounting extensive operations aimed at
the country’s new left. When the plan was formalized, approved
by the president and presented to Hoover, he balked, fearing it
would bring down the FBI.  The president then created the Plumbers, his own secret
squad of burglars and wire tappers headed up by ex-FBI man G. Gordon Liddy.  I spoke with Tim Weiner, author of “Enemies: A History of
the FBI,” on the following topics:  1. Invention of the FBI  2. Hoover’s Manipulations  3. Hatred of CIA  4. From Hero to Villain  5. Modern Surveillance State  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
