Barclays Capital  advised selling the
euro against the dollar and the Norwegian krone as funds
provided by the  European Central Bank  in next week’s three-year
longer term refinancing operation weigh on the currency.  “The chances of the February LTRO being a liquidity supply
shock are very large,” New York-based Aroop Chatterjee and
London-based Raghav Subbarao, currency strategists at the bank,
wrote in an investor report dated yesterday. “We would expect
the euro to weaken against the dollar, as well as underperform
risky currencies as financial conditions improve.”  The euro was little changed at $1.3373 at 6:57 a.m. London
time after reaching $1.3380, its strongest level since Dec. 12.
The 17-nation currency was also little changed at 7.5152 krone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
