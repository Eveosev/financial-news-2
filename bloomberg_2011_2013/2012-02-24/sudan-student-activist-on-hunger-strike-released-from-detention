A Sudanese student activist who went
on hunger strike to protest his arrest without charge was
released late yesterday, his lawyer said.  Taj Alsir Jaafar, 25, a member of a youth movement known as
Girifna, or “we’re fed up,” returned to his home in Ombdurman,
across the Nile River from the capital, Khartoum, his lawyer,
Abdul Moneam Adam, said today phone.  Jaafar was arrested on Dec. 30 after participating in a
university protest in support of people displaced by the Merowe
Dam, north of Khartoum. London-based  Amnesty International  urged
 Sudan  on Jan. 24 to release Jaafa, saying he’s “at risk of
torture or other ill-treatment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
