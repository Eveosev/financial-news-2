Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil
producer, canceled the tender for a Urals crude cargo loading on
Feb. 27 to Feb. 28 from the  Baltic Sea  port of Ust-Luga,
according to three traders who participate in the market.  Glencore International Plc, which was awarded the 100,000-
metric-ton cargo last week, will get one or two shipments from
Primorsk on the Baltic Sea as compensation, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the information is
confidential.  OAO Transneft, which operates the new  oil terminal , plans
to perform a “test” loading of a 100,000-ton tanker starting
on Feb. 29 or March 1 that will be monitored by  Russia ’s
industrial safety watchdog, Rostekhnadzor, Igor Dyomin, a
spokesman for the oil pipeline monopoly, said by phone from
Moscow today.  Ust-Luga’s opening was delayed from the end of November
because of engineering difficulties at the wharves, Dyomin said
in December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
