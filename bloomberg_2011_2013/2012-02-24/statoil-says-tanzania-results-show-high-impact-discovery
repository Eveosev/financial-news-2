Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s largest oil
producer, said a natural gas find in the waters off off Tanzania
with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  “is a high impact discovery.”  Logging from the Zafarani exploration well in offshore
block 2 shows at least 5 trillion cubic feet of gas in place,
the company said in a statement in Oslo. The well encountered
120 meters (390 feet) of reservoir with high porosity and high
permeability, it said.  “This discovery is the first Statoil-operated discovery in
east Africa,” said Tim Dodson, Statoil’s vice-president for
exploration. “It is also a demonstration of how Statoil’s
exploration strategy of early access and high-impact
opportunities strongly supports the company’s ambition for
international growth.”  Statoil is joining the race to find gas in east Africa so
it can be turned into liquid and shipped to China and India, the
world’s fastest-growing major economies.  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA)   Plc
this week bid $1.6 billion for Cove Energy Plc, a company with a
stake in a 30 trillion-cubic-feet gas find in Mozambique, just
south of Tanzania.  Statoil operates the license on Block 2 on behalf of
Tanzania  Petroleum Development Corporation (PETD)  and has a 65 percent
interest. Exxon holds the remaining 35 percent. TPDC has the
right to a 10 percent working interest if the project moves to
development.  “This discovery could potentially be a catalyst for large
scale natural gas developments in Tanzania,” said Yona
Killaghane, managing director of TPDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
