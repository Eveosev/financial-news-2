China’s stocks  rose, capping a sixth
week of gains for the benchmark index, on speculation local
governments are relaxing restrictions on the  property market  and
an improving global economy will spur Chinese exports.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048)  jumped 3.5 percent today,
leading a gauge of developers to the biggest advance by an
industry group this week, after  Shanghai  said it will implement
differentiated tax and mortgage policies. Anhui Conch Cement Co.
climbed to a three-month high on prospects low-income housing
construction will boost cement demand.  China Shenhua Energy Co. (601808) 
and  China Coal Energy Co. (601898)  led gains for coal stocks on
expectations easing liquidity will boost demand for energy as a
cut in banks’  reserve requirements  takes effect today.  “Expectations are that monetary policy easing will help
the economy hit bottom soon,” said Wang Weijun, a strategist at
Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai. “Data from the U.S. are
very supportive for stocks. The rebound will carry on.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 30.07 points, or 1.3
percent, to 2,439.63 at the close, the highest close since Nov.
17. Trading volume in the Shanghai gauge was 68 percent higher
than average at this time over past 30 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 1.6 percent to
2,648.02. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, retreated 0.3 percent
yesterday in  New York .  Weekly Winning Stretch  The Shanghai Composite rallied 3.5 percent this week after
the central bank announced a cut in reserve requirements last
weekend, the second reduction in three months as investors
speculated a credit crunch was curbing lending to small
companies. The gauge’s weekly winning streak is the longest
since November 2010.  The Shanghai index has rebounded 11 percent this year on
expectations the government will ease monetary policies to
bolster economic growth that cooled to the slowest pace in 2 1/2
years in the fourth quarter of 2011. The measure trades at 10
times estimated earnings, compared with a record low of 8.9
times on Jan. 6, according to  weekly data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “We really like  China ,”  Daphne Roth , Singapore-based head
of Asian equity research at ABN Amro Private Bank, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview today. The nation’s stocks are
the bank’s top pick because of a “pretty low” valuation after
equities slumped last year, she said.  Investor interest in Chinese equities is increasing. The
value of shares traded on the Shanghai stock exchange reaching
the highest since Nov. 3 on Feb. 22, almost the double the daily
average over the past 100 days, Bloomberg data showed, while new
stock account openings jumped 19 percent to 187,748 accounts in
the week ended ended Feb. 17, according to the China Securities
Depository and Clearing Corp.  Property Stocks  A measure of  property stocks  in the Shanghai Composite
jumped 3.9 percent today, adding to this week’s 9.3 percent
gain, the most since October. Poly Real Estate, China’s second-
largest developer by market value, rose 3.5 percent to 11.70
yuan today.  China Vanke Co. (000002) , the biggest, added 3.9 percent to
8.51 yuan. Hangzhou Binjiang Real Estate Group Co. surged 5.6
percent to 8.87 yuan.  Shanghai, China’s biggest commercial city, will implement
differentiated taxation and mortgage policies for home buyers
and will have increased affordable housing by 1 million units by
2015, according to a five-year housing plan posted on the city
government’s website on Feb. 22. The Shanghai government also
said this week it will allow some residence permit holders to
buy second homes by loosening the definition of locals.  “The rally carried on as property easing signals from
local governments loomed,” said Dai Fang, a Shanghai-based
analyst at Zheshang Securities.  Construction Stocks  Falling  home prices  are fueling an attempt by China’s
smaller cities to relax tightening on property policies. The
eastern city of Wuhu was the first Chinese city this year to
ease curb measures ordered by the central government by waiving
a deed tax and subsidizing some home purchases. The move was
suspended three days later, following the outcome of a similar
attempt in October by Foshan in southern China.  Anhui Conch, whose materials are used in low-income
housing, advanced 3.6 percent to 18.28 yuan. Huaxin Cement Co.,
an affiliate of Holcim Ltd., climbed 5.5 percent to 16.23 yuan.
 Tangshan Jidong Cement Co. (000401)  surged 6.4 percent to 19.88 yuan.  The country’s leading economic indicator gained 1.6 percent
to 225.7 in January from the previous month, the Conference
Board said in a statement, citing a preliminary reading. The
gauge rose 0.8 percent in December.  In the U.S., applications for jobless benefits were
unchanged in the week ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, the fewest since
March 2008, Labor Department data showed. Another report showed
that a gauge of home prices jumped 0.7 percent in December,
beating estimates. An industry report also showed German
business confidence climbed.  Improving Liquidity  Europe and U.S. are China’s biggest export markets, making
up 35 percent of the Asian nation’s overseas shipments,
according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  A measure of  energy stocks  in the CSI 300 rose 2 percent
today, the most among the 10 industry groups. Shenhua, the
largest coal producer, added 1.3 percent to 28.12 yuan. China
Coal, the second largest, rose 2 percent to 10.11 yuan.  Datong
Coal Industry Co. (601001) , the third biggest, advanced 1.9 percent to
14.33 yuan.  The central bank announced a 0.5 percentage point cut in
lenders’ reserve-ratio requirements on Feb. 18. Easing liquidity
will boost demand for energy, said Wang Shi, a Shanghai-based
coal analyst with Northeast Securities Ltd.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, tumbled 102 basis points
to 4.48 percent as of 3:12 p.m. in Shanghai, according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. That’s the biggest decline since Jan. 19.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Bonnie Cao and Winnie Zhu
