Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.11 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.09 percent yesterday after trading

February 2036 to February 2042 today. The purchases are part of
the Fed’s program to replace $400 billion of short-term debt in
its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries to reduce borrowing
costs further and counter risks of a recession.  The central bank plans to buy $1.5 billion to $2 billion of
securities today, according to the New York Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
