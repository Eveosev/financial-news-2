U.S. stocks erased gains as banks
declined and a surge in  oil prices  weighed on consumer and
transportation shares, overshadowing better-than-forecast data
on home sales and  consumer confidence .  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 was little changed at 1,363.31 at
2:33 p.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as 0.4 percent
earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 27.4 points, or
0.2 percent, to 12,957.29 after earlier topping 13,000 for the
second time since 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
