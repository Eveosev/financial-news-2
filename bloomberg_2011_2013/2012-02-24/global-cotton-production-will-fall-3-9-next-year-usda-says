Global cotton  output  will fall 3.9
percent to 118.5 million bales in the year beginning Aug. 1 from
an estimated 123.3 million in the current season, according to
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Global  consumption  will increase to 114.5 million bales
from 109.7 million, the agency said today at a forum in
Arlington, Virginia.  Before today, cotton futures in  New York  tumbled 59 percent
from a record $2.197 a pound on March 7, partly because demand
slumped as the global economy faltered.  A bale weighs 480 pounds (218 kilograms). The U.S. is the
worldâ€™s largest exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
