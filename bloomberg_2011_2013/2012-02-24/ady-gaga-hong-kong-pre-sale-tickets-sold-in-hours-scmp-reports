Some Hong Kong fans of Lady Gaga
were left disappointed yesterday after the first batch of
tickets for a concert in the city were sold out within three
hours at one outlet, the  South China Morning Post  reported.   Fans vied with “professional queuers” and ticket touts to
secure bookings for the concert, according to the report. The
tickets were available exclusively to American Express card
holders, who were each restricted to eight, the Post said.   One unidentified woman said she was paid HK$70 ($9.03) an
hour to stand in the queue and had been in line for 30 hours,
according to the report. Ada Lau said she bought eight of the
HK$1,580 tickets and immediately sold four at a 150 percent
profit, the Post said.   Simon Clarke bought eight tickets for HK$480 each, as a
surprise for his two sons, whom he said would be inspired by
Lady Gaga, according to the Post. Clarke said he had asked the
family’s domestic helper to stand in the queue from 6:30 a.m. to
secure the tickets, it reported.  About 6,000 tickets were available yesterday, according to
the report. An unidentified Amex spokeswoman didn’t disclose the
number of tickets that went on sale when contacted by the Post,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
