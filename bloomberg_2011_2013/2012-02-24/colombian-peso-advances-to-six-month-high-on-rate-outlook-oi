Colombia ’s peso touched a six-month
high before the central bank raised  interest rates  today and as
oil, the nation’s biggest export, gained.  The peso climbed as much as 0.6 percent to 1,765.80 per
 U.S. dollar , the strongest intraday level since Aug. 17, before
ending the day up less than 0.1 percent at 1,775.75. The peso
rose 0.2 percent in the past five days for the eighth straight
week of gains, the longest streak since the period ended June 1,
2007.  Policy makers increased the overnight lending rate to 5.25
percent today after the peso ended trading, as forecast by 22 of
36 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Oil advanced for a seventh
day, the longest winning streak since January 2010, on signs of
economic recovery from the U.S. to  Germany . Crude accounts for
about 40 percent of Colombia’s sales abroad.  “Oil is a big part of Colombia’s exports, so when it gains
not only does it imply stronger inflows but it makes the peso
more attractive as a commodity currency,” said Daniel Lozano,
an analyst at Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
7.37 percent, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.133 centavo to 120.879 centavos per peso. Trading ended before
the central bank’s rate decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
