Purchases of  new homes  in the U.S.
exceeded forecasts in January after climbing a month earlier to a
one-year high, more evidence the housing market is stabilizing.  Sales, tabulated when contracts are signed, fell 0.9 percent
to a 321,000 annual pace from a 324,000 rate in December that was
stronger than previously reported, figures from the Commerce
Department showed today in Washington. The  median  estimate of 77
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a rise to
315,000. The number of homes for sale dropped to a record low.  Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZ)  and  D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI)  are among
builders benefiting from job gains as well as cheaper properties
and lower  mortgage rates  that have driven affordability to a
record high. At the same time, foreclosures that depress prices
remain a risk, one reason policy makers including Federal Reserve
officials are seeking ways to bolster the industry.  “Sales are very low but are getting better,” said  Patrick
Newport , an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
 Massachusetts . “It’s a combination of an improving economy and
labor market.”  Economists’ estimates ranged from 300,000 to 355,000. The
rate for December was previously reported at 307,000, a decline
of 2.2 percent.  Consumer Sentiment  Consumer sentiment this month unexpectedly climbed to a one-
year high. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index
for February  rose to 75.3  from 75 at the end of January.
Economists projected a reading of 73 after a preliminary February
figure of 72.5.  Stocks extended gains after the reports. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2 percent to 1,366.38 at 10:22 a.m. in
 New York .  For all of 2011, builders sold 304,000 homes, down 5.8
percent from the previous year.  The recent pickup in sales has helped reduce inventory.
There were 151,000 new houses on the market at the end of
January, the fewest on record. The supply of homes at the current
sales rate dropped to 5.6 months’ worth, the lowest since January
2006, from 5.7 months in December.  The median sales price decreased 9.6 percent in January from
the same month last year to $217,100, today’s report showed.  By Region  Purchases fell in two of four U.S. regions, led by a 25
percent slump in the Midwest and an 11 percent drop in the West.
Sales were up 11 percent in the Northeast and 9.3 percent in the
South.  New-home sales , which are tabulated when contracts are
signed, have lost their ability to forecast the broader market as
demand shifts to previously owned houses. Purchases of existing
houses are calculated when a deal closes about a month or two
later. New properties made up almost 7 percent of the market last
year.  Existing-home (ETSLTOTL)  purchases rose to a 4.57 million annual rate,
the National Association of Realtors reported this week. While it
was the highest level since May 2010, distressed properties made
up the largest portion of all purchases since April. The median
price fell 2 percent to $154,700 last month from January 2011.  Demand is getting a boost as more homes become affordable.
The Realtors group’s  measure  of whether households earning the
median income can buy a median-priced property at current
 interest rates  reached record levels in the last three months of
2011, recent data showed.  Warmer Weather  The fourth-warmest January on record may have helped sustain
home buying. The  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
reported the average temperature was 36.3 degrees Fahrenheit
(2.39 degrees Celsius), 5.5 degrees above the 1901-2000 long-term
average.  Among other housing data, builders broke ground on more
homes than forecast in January, and permits also advanced. The
National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index of
builder confidence climbed in February to the highest level since
May 2007.  D.R. Horton , the largest U.S. homebuilder by volume,
reported net home orders rose to 3,794 in the final three months
of 2011, from 3,363 a year earlier. Beazer Homes said demand
jumped 36 percent in that period, and closings on new houses
surged more than 60 percent.  ‘Gradually Improving’  “While our visibility into the economic conditions for the
remainder of the year is limited, I believe that we will benefit
from a gradually improving housing market,” Allan Merrill, chief
executive officer of Atlanta-based Beazer, said on an earnings
call on Feb. 2.  Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and three other
U.S. banks reached a $25 billion settlement with 49 states and
the U.S. government to end a probe of abusive foreclosure
practices prompted by the collapse of the housing price bubble.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has said the central bank’s
efforts to spur growth are being blunted by impediments to
mortgage lending, and called for more steps to heal housing.  “We need to continue to develop and implement policies that
will help the housing sector get back on its feet,” Bernanke
told homebuilders on Feb. 10 in  Orlando ,  Florida .  To contact the reporters on this story:
