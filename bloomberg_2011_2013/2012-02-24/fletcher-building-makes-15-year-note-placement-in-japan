Fletcher Building Ltd., New
Zealand’s largest construction company, raised 10 billion yen
($125 million) from a private placement of 15-year notes with
Japanese institutions  The proceeds of the placement have been swapped to floating
Australian dollars and will be used to repay existing
borrowings, the Auckland-based company said in a statement.  The issue diversifies the company’s debt-funding sources
with a new currency and extends the duration of the debt
portfolio, Chief Financial Officer Bill Roest said in the
statement. Morgan Stanley advised on transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
