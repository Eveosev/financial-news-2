51job, Inc. (JOBS) , which provides human
resource services in  China , surged to the highest price in four
months in U.S. trading after fourth-quarter profit jumped and
exceeded analysts’ forecast.  American depositary receipts of 51job rose 11 percent to
$50.24 by 9:59 a.m. in New York, the strongest intraday level
since Oct. 28. Each ADR represents two common shares.  51job’s net income rose 70 percent to 113.9 million yuan
($18.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2011 from a year
earlier, or 61 U.S. cents for each ADR, the Shanghai-based
company said in a statement yesterday. That beat the 53-cent
average  estimate  of two analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The company expected sales to be between 375 million yuan
to 390 million yuan in the first quarter this year, surpassing
the 355.8 million forecast of analysts.  Analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group and RBS Asia Ltd.
reiterated their “positive” or “buy” recommendations on the
company today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
