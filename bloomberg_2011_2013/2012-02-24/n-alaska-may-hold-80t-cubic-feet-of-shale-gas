Alaska ’s North Slope shales may hold
as much as 80 trillion cubic feet of gas, or more than half the
highest estimate for the Marcellus formation, and as much as 2
billion barrels of oil, the  U.S. Geological Survey  said.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration and the state of
Alaska are offering more access to oil and natural gas resources
on land and in the Arctic waters to help lower dependence on
imported fuel and push more crude through a major oil pipeline
crossing the state.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  plans to start
drilling this year in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, which are
off the coast of the North Slope.  “Alaska’s energy resources hold great promise and economic
opportunity for the American people,” Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  said today in an e-mailed statement.  The geological service, part of the Interior Department,
said in a statement that North Slope shale hasn’t been developed
because of economic and infrastructure considerations.  The assessment, the first made of North Slope shale
resources, is based on success in extracting oil and gas from
similar formations, such as the Marcellus Shale in the U.S.
East. The agency last year estimated Marcellus may hold as much
as 144 trillion cubic feet of gas.  Shale gas and shale oil, produced by horizontal drilling
and hydraulic fracturing by injecting water and chemicals
underground, led to record natural gas output in the U.S. last
year and 33 percent decline in prices in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
