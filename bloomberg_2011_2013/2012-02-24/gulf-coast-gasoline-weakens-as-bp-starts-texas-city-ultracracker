Gulf Coast gasoline weakened as  BP
Plc (BP/)  started an ultracracker at the  Texas  City refinery in Texas.  “The ultracracker will resume normal operations,” BP said
in a filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
The event was scheduled to begin today and last through Feb. 27.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  widened 0.37 cent to 16 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:04 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
2.68 cents to $3.1586 a gallon.  BP’s Texas City refinery can process 475,000 barrels of oil
a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Citgo Petroleum Corp. extinguished a small fire today at
the Corpus Christi East refinery in Texas, according to a
company statement. There was no disruption to the unit and no
damage to equipment, Citgo said.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  New York Harbor (MOSNY87P) 
narrowed its premium 0.88 cent versus futures.  Gasoline stockpiles in  Padd 1 (DOESGAS1) , the U.S. East Coast, rose
2.19 million barrels to 64.1 million barrels last week,
according to the Energy Department. It’s the highest level since
February 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
