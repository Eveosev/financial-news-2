The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development may arrange a syndicated loan of as much as 65
million euros ($88 million) to fund a power line in Montenegro.  The 400 kilovolt line will stretch 155 kilometers (97
miles) from Pljevlja in the north to Lastva on the  Adriatic Sea ,
where it will link up with a planned undersea cable from Italy,
the London-based lender said today on its website.  The loan has cleared concept review, with approval expected
April 25, and will be made to  Crnogorski Elektroprenosni Sistem ,
or CGES, Montenegro’s grid operator. In 2010, CGES and  Terna SpA (TRN) 
signed an agreement to lay the cable across the Adriatic.  “The investment directly supports the development of the
regional  electricity market  in southeast Europe by putting in
place the infrastructure that will allow electricity trade
between the region and Italy,” today’s statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
