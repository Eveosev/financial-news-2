BP Plc is in talks with  Iraq  to
boost output from the Kirkuk oilfield in the north of the
country, the  Middle East Economic Survey  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  BP officials will meet with Iraq’s North Oil Co. within
weeks to discuss increasing capacity at Kirkuk to as much as
700,000 barrels a day over the next five years, from about
260,000 a day, MEES said. Iraq’s oil minister, Abdul Kareem Al- Luaibi, met with BP executives in  London  on Feb. 22 after the
company expressed an interest in the field, MEES said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
