Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) ,  India ’s
biggest company by market value, sold $500 million more of its
existing 5.4 percent bonds due February 2022.  The notes were priced to yield 325 basis points, or 3.25
percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the
company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Reliance sold
$1 billion of the bonds on Feb. 9 at a spread of 345 basis
points, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The owner of the world’s largest refining complex got more
than $3.7 billion of orders from investors, and half of the
additional debt was sold to accounts in the U.S., according to
the statement.  Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc arranged
the sale, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
