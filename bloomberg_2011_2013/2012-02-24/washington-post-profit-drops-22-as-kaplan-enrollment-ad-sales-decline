Washington Post Co. (WPO) , publisher of
the namesake newspaper, said fourth-quarter profit fell 22
percent after enrollment at its Kaplan education unit and print
advertising sales declined.  Net income decreased to $61.7 million, or $8.03 a share,
from $79 million, or $9.42, a year earlier, the Washington-based
company said today in a statement. Revenue declined 10 percent
to $1.06 billion.  The Kaplan business, the largest unit accounting for about
60 percent of  revenue , has come under government scrutiny along
with the rest of the for-profit education industry. Enrollment
at Kaplan university and higher-education campuses fell 23
percent from a year earlier. Print ad sales at the Washington
Post newspaper decreased 6 percent in the quarter.  Washington Post dropped less than 1 percent to $387.31 at
10 a.m. in  New York . The shares had increased 3.2 percent this
year before today,  compared  with an 8.4 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. was the company’s
largest outside shareholder with  27 percent  of outstanding
shares as of Dec. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
