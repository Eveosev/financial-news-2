Roberto Martinez , general manager of
the state-owned Honduran National Energy Company, yesterday
became the third member of President Porfirio Lobo’s Cabinet to
resign in the past two weeks.  Martinez submitted his resignation to the Ministry of the
Presidency about 5 p.m., Luz Tome, public relations
representative for the company, said in a phone call from
Tegucigalpa. His replacement has not yet been named.  Eight days earlier, Martinez was questioned by members of
the National Congress over a contract signed in November with
Connecticut-based Westport Financing LLC to provide diesel-
generated electricity. The project has yet to begin, Tome said.
A representative of Westport, who confirmed the contract in a
phone call from  Connecticut , declined to give further details.  During a speech on Feb. 10, President Porfirio Lobo said he
planned to “score eight goals during the next 15 days” in
reference to the potential dismissal of government ministers.  Since then, Trade and Industry Minister Jose Francisco Zelaya and Finance Minister William Chong Wong have stepped down
from their posts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
