A benchmark gauge of U.S. company
credit risk dropped to the lowest level in more than two weeks
as economic reports showed America’s economy is weathering
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt turmoil.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
decreased 0.5 basis point to a mid-price of 96 basis points at
4:43 p.m. in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd.  The gauge slid as the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan final index of U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly
increased this month to 75.3 from 75 in January. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called for a reading of 73,
which was above 72.5, the preliminary figure. Purchases of new
homes exceeded forecasts in January after climbing a month
earlier to a one-year high, the Commerce Department reported.  The swaps index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, ended at the
lowest level since Feb. 8. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value
if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group
of 20 nations meet tomorrow in  Mexico  and may discuss committing
fresh cash to the  International Monetary Fund  to help defuse the
European fiscal crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
