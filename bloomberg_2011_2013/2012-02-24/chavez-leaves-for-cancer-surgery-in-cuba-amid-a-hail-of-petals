Supporters threw flowers in front of
Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ’s motorcade today as he drove
through Caracas on his way to Cuba for a third operation in his
battle against cancer.  Images aired in a nationwide broadcast showed the self-
declared socialist leaning out of the sun roof of his car and
waving to supporters, some of them in tears.  “Cancer or no cancer, rain, thunder or lightning, nothing
and no one will be able to stop the new patriotic victory in
October 2012,” Chavez said outside the presidential palace
before departing, referring to the presidential vote. “We are
obliged to live and obliged to triumph in order to guarantee
 Venezuela ’s peace.”  Chavez said Feb. 21 that tests undertaken during a
previously unannounced trip to Cuba showed a lesion in the same
area where a tumor was removed in June. It is “highly”
probable that the growth is malignant, in which case it will
need radiation therapy, he said. The president has vowed to
recover from cancer in time to deal a “knockout” blow to his
opponents in the Oct. 7 election.  Chavez, who said in October he was cancer-free following
two operations and four rounds of chemotherapy, has refused to
say what kind of cancer he has or allow access to his medical
records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
