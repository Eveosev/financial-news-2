Equatorial Guinea  will increase
exports of its Zafiro crude for April to four cargoes, one more
than March, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  The west African nation will also export two consignments
of its Ceiba blend, one less than March, a separate schedule
shows. The shipments are 1 million barrels each.  Chad will ship four 950,000-barrel cargoes of Doba crude in
April, one more than next month, while  Ghana  will reduce Jubilee
exports for April to two shipments of 950,000 barrels each from
three in March, loading programs show.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
