Commercial property vacancy rates
are forecast to decline from offices to warehouses as the U.S.
economic recovery strengthens and the jobless rate improves.  “Vacancy rates are improving in all of the major
commercial real estate sectors,”  Lawrence Yun , chief economist
for the National Association of Realtors said today in a report.
“Sustained  job creation  is benefiting commercial real estate
sectors by increasing demand for space.”  Industrial and retail properties will have the biggest fall
in vacancy rates, the Washington-based group forecast. NAR
estimates declines over the next year of 0.9 percent for retail,
0.8 percent for industrial, 0.4 percent for offices and 0.2
percent in the multifamily rental market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
