Stocks are in the midst of a “hope
phase” that may be as short-lived as one that occurred a year
earlier, according to  Albert Edwards , a global strategist at
Societe Generale SA.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index’s performance since October with its year-ago swings, as
Edwards did yesterday in a report. Last year, the index dropped
during the second half of February, rebounded to reach its 2011
high in April, and tumbled in a second-half bout of volatility.  This year’s gains reflect anticipation of sustained U.S.
economic growth and a so-called soft landing for the Chinese
economy, according to Edwards, based in  London . He also cited
optimism that Greece’s second bailout and the European Central
Bank’s moves to ease bank financing will help the euro region.  “Hope still beats in the breast of equity investors,” he
wrote. “The market will rip out that hope and consume it in
front of investors’ eyes.”  Corporate earnings may be a catalyst for the abandonment of
hope, the report said. Edwards noted that estimates for S&P 500
companies as a group are dropping for the first time since late
2007, when the  U.S. economy  was sliding into a recession.  Edwards reiterated in September that the index will fall to
400, a plunge of about 70 percent from yesterday’s close, before
the next  bull market  begins. He saw the yield on 10-year
Treasury notes falling to 1.5 percent. Last year’s low was 1.67
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
