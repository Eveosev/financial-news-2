The Czech Republic’s PX stock index
rose for the first time in four days, adding 0.7 percent to
1,001.3 at the close in  Prague .  The following were among the most active equities on the
Prague stock exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , the Czech unit of  Societe
Generale  SA, climbed for the first week in three as Bank of
America Corp. raised its outlook for the European banking
industry to “overweight” from “neutral.”  Komercni climbed 1.3 percent to close at 3,640 koruna,
bringing its gain to the week to 1.8 percent. Societe Generale
rose 6.2 percent to 24.43 euros in Paris.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  , eastern Europe’s second-
biggest lender, gained as much as 4.7 percent in Prague and
closed up 2 percent higher at 458 koruna. The shares were up 2.5
percent in their home market of Vienna.  Erste probably swung to net income of 228 million euros
($292 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31 after a net
loss of 1.49 billion euros in the third quarter and net income
of 245 million euros a year earlier, according to the average
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank is due
to report results Feb. 29.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the largest Czech coking-
coal company, gained a second day as signs of economic recovery
in the U.S. and Germany drove demand for commodities.  The stock rose 0.3 percent to close at 154 koruna, after
adding 2.3 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
