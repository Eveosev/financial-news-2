German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
Greece will receive a second rescue package if it meets all
conditions agreed on with fellow euro-area states.  Greece’s debt swap with private creditors is “new
territory” and European leaders will need to await its outcome,
Merkel told reporters in Stralsund, Germany, today after talks
with Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker .  “The night isn’t yet over, because before the March 1-2
summit we will have a meeting of the euro finance ministers to
assess what Greece has to fulfill in terms of pre-conditions,”
Juncker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
