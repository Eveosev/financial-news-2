Ireland’s economy will grow by less
than 1 percent this year as the euro region “muddles through”
its debt crisis and austerity measures weigh on consumers, the
 Economic & Social Research Institute  said.  Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the
economy, will rise by 0.9 percent in 2012, with growth
accelerating to 2.3 percent in 2013, the Dublin-based institute
said in its quarterly bulletin today. The ESRI estimates the
economy grew by 0.9 percent last year.  Europe ’s debt crisis is hampering the international global
recovery that Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny is relying on to
revive the country’s economy after a real-estate bubble
collapsed. Europe has slipped into a “mild” recession,
European Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn said
yesterday.  “While the austerity measures currently being undertaken
correct the public finances, they have a dampening effect on
economic activity,” the ESRI said. “The consequences of the
collapse of the bubble affecting the economy in the 2000s are
plain and obvious.”  Kenny’s government is cutting spending and raising taxes to
narrow the fiscal shortfall, after the previous administration
sought an international bailout in 2010. The state will meet its
deficit target of 8.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2012
and 7.5 percent in 2013, the ESRI said.  “There is no realistic alternative to austerity given the
fiscal imbalances and the scale of government debt,” the ESRI
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
