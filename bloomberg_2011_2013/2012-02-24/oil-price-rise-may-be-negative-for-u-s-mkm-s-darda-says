A bigger jump in  oil prices , driven
higher by tensions with Iran that are threatening supplies, may
hurt U.S. economic growth, said Michael Darda, chief economist
at MKM Partners LP.  “A supply shock is a negative,” whereas price gains
caused by a pickup in demand would be less of a concern, Darda
said today in an interview with Kathleen Hays on Bloomberg
Radio’s “The Hays Advantage.” He said “this is mostly a
supply shock” that may reduce economic growth by “a couple of
tenths” of a percentage point.  Recent reports have shown the economy is improving, and
gains in labor-market data “may be more sustainable” than many
economists predict, said Darda, who is based in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . It is also a “reasonable” concern that the
expansion is “fragile,” he said.  Oil climbed for a seventh day, the longest streak of
advances since January 2010. Crude oil for April delivery rose
$1.26, or 1.2 percent, to $109.09 a barrel at 1:03 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract reached $109.16, the
highest level since May 5.  “It’s not going to be a make-or-break situation at these
levels,” Darda said. If further shocks result in oil prices
that are almost double, “then all bets are off,” he said. “It
would just depend on where we go from here.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
