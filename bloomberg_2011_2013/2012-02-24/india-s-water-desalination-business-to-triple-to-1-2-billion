India ’s water desalination business
is set to triple to $1.2 billion by 2017 as rising demand from
industry spurs the South Asian country to build more
purification plants, according to a research report.  The number of units that process sea water in India will
reach 500 in five years from 180 now, with more than 300 plants
being built in the states of  Tamil Nadu , Gujarat and
Maharashtra,  TechSci Research  said in its report.  Saudi Arabia 
leads the global desalination market worth $14.3 billion,
according to Karan Chechi, TechSci’s research director.  “Improved hybrid technologies and reverse osmosis have cut
production costs and initial investment in water desalination
industry compared with traditional methods,” Chechi said in a
telephone interview from Noida, near  New Delhi . “This is
attracting investors.”  Indiscriminate sinking of wells by farmers is depleting
ground water resources in the world’s second-most populous
nation, prompting the government to spend about $1 billion for
mapping aquifers. Desalination plants may help supply water for
power producers, drug makers and others, said Chechi.  More than 85 percent of India’s villages and half of its
cities rely on wells for water in the country where farming
accounts for 90 percent of total water withdrawals. India
allocated 536.6 billion rupees ($11 billion) for urban supply
projects in the  five years  ending March 2012.  The market for desalination in India, which has a coastline
of 7,517 kilometers (4,671 miles), may be worth $630 million by
2014, according to TechSci. Power plants and pharmaceutical
companies use 72 percent of the current capacity, with the
remainder taken up by municipal corporations, TechSci said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
