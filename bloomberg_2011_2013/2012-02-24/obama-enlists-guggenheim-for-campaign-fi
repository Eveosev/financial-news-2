With Hollywood gathering this
weekend for the 84th Academy Awards, President  Barack Obama  has
recruited Oscar-winning documentary director Davis Guggenheim to
again produce a short film for his campaign.  Obama’s re-election staff in  Chicago  spent $162,834 on the
film last month, according to the January Federal Election
Commission filing. Currently in post-production, the film
focuses on the president’s first three years in office,
according to a campaign official.  The film will be less than 30 minutes long and released in
weeks, though the exact date hasn’t been decided, according to
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The campaign
is still considering how it will be used, the official said.  This is just the latest involvement with Obama’s campaign
for Guggenheim, who directed “Waiting for Superman,” a
documentary about the U.S. education system, and won an Oscar in
2006 for “An Inconvenient Truth,” which chronicled former Vice
President  Al Gore ’s drive to raise awareness about  climate
change .  In 2008, the filmmaker directed a  biographical  film about
Obama for the Democratic National Convention. He also was
involved in a 30-minute advertisement that the campaign ran on
three major broadcast networks in the closing days before the
election at a cost of more than $3 million.  The money spent last month covers the major cost of the
film’s production, though the campaign isn’t ruling out
additional spending for the film, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
