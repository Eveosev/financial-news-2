A 10 percentage point increase in
bets by  hedge funds  that equities will gain wasn’t enough to
keep their short sales from limiting returns to half the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s performance in 2012.  The average equity hedge fund returned 3 percent this year
through Feb. 10, compared with 7 percent for the S&P 500,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report dated Feb. 21. A
Goldman Sachs  index  of the 50 most-common stock investments at
hedge funds gained 10 percent.  The funds lagged behind even after boosting their net long
exposure, a measure of how much they’re investing in bets that
stocks will rise, to 46 percent in the fourth quarter from 36
percent at the end of September. The figure was down from 50
percent in December 2010.  The outperformance of the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP
Basket suggests “that ‘hedges’ and modest net exposure have
created a drag on performance rather than poor stock
selection,” wrote  David Kostin , a New York-based strategist at
Goldman Sachs, in the Feb. 21 note. “Despite finding success
with their top picks, lack of net exposure to the cyclical rally
has caused hedge funds to lag both the  S&P 500  and the average
large-cap core mutual fund so far in 2012.”  Improved data on U.S. jobs, manufacturing and housing have
helped S&P 500 industries linked to the economy do best in 2012,
 led  by technology and financial companies. Unprecedented market
volatility and concern  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis would
trigger a global recession boosted the appeal of defensive
stocks last year, causing utility and consumer staples companies
to post the highest returns.  Apple, LyondellBasell  The VIP basket, which includes Apple Inc.,  Bank of America
Corp.  and LyondellBasell Industries NV, declined 3.1 percent in
2011, while the S&P 500 was unchanged. Hedge funds trailed the
S&P 500 and mutual funds last year, losing 4 percent, according
to the Goldman Sachs data. The benchmark index had a total
return of 2 percent, while mutual funds fell 1 percent.  Bearish bets on the companies investors hated most in 2011
have backfired this year. The 26 stocks in the S&P 500 with the
highest so-called short interest relative to shares available
for trading rallied 18 percent this year through Feb. 17,
compared with 8.2 percent for the full index, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
