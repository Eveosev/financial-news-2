Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System’s Oxford Properties said it may invest more
than C$3 billion ($3.1 billion) in a downtown Toronto
development.  The project, one of the largest urban redevelopments in
 North America , includes a renovated and expanded convention
center, hotel and casino complex and a 5.5-acre urban park,
Toronto-based Oxford Properties said in statement today.  “If the decision is made to have a casino in the City of
Toronto, Oxford believes it can provide the best location and
the ideal solution for all stakeholders,” Oxford Properties
Chief Executive Officer Blake Hutcheson said in the statement.
“Oxford Place is a well-conceived private sector solution that
requires no public infrastructure or other funding and drives
significant community benefits.”  Omers, a pension fund manager in  Canada ’s most-populous
province, posted a 3.2 percent return on investments last year,
led by private equity, real estate and infrastructure holdings
the fund said in an earnings statement. It invests in real
estate and manages more than C$55 billion of assets for more
than 420,000 retired and active municipal employees in Ontario.  The development would be called Oxford Place and also
includes renovation of Metro Toronto Convention Centre.
Architectural firm Foster & Partners will be responsible for the
master plan, Oxford Properties said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
