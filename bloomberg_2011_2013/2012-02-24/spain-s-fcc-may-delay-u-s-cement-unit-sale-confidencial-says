Fomento de Construcciones &
Contratas SA may delay the sale of its U.S. cement business
after receiving offers that were below its expectations,  El
Confidencial  reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge
of the matter.  While FCC wanted 600 million euros ($800 million) for the
unit, potential buyers don’t foresee a U.S. economic recovery
yet that will revive demand for cement, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
