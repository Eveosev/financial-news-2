Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. lender, said cyber attackers got into customer accounts
last year as the threat of electronic intrusions increased.  The bank cited data breaches that gave outsiders access to
account information or interrupted service, and attacks on
systems run by clients that gave the intruders entrance to
Citigroup’s systems so they could extract customer data,
according to the bank’s  annual report  to securities regulators.
Citigroup said it also suffered denial-of-service attacks, which
typically involve outsiders causing a website to crash.  “While Citi was able to detect these prior incidents
before they became significant, they still resulted in losses as
well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat
of similar future cyber incidents,” the New York-based bank
said today in its filing.  Citigroup said the attacks occurred “recently” without
giving specifics on the timing or how many people were affected.
 Sean Kevelighan , a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to comment.
The bank said in June that more than 360,000 credit-card
accounts, or 1.5 percent of the bank’s total in  North America ,
may have been affected in a hacker breach the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
