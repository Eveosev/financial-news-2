Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , eastern
 Europe ’s second-biggest lender, probably returned to profit in
the fourth quarter, leaving behind writedowns and charges as its
underlying business held up.  Erste probably swung to net income of 228 million euros
($292 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31 after a net
loss of 1.49 billion euros in the third quarter and net income
of 245 million euros a year earlier, according to the average
estimate of 11  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank is  due
to report  results Feb. 29 at 7:30 a.m.  Net interest income, Vienna-based Erste’s biggest revenue
source, may have risen by 5 percent from a year earlier to 1.41
billion euros, the average estimate showed. Provisions for bad
loans probably rose by 7 percent, while fee and commission
income shrunk by 3 percent.  Erste reported writedowns and loan-loss charges at its
Hungarian and Romanian units and losses because of credit
default swaps on Oct. 10, which will lead to a 2011 loss of as
much as 800 million euros, the bank has said. It is also filling
a 743 million-euro capital shortfall determined by the European
Banking Authority.  The following is a table of analyst estimates and results
from the previous and year-earlier quarters. The figures are in
millions of euros.  The following banks participated in the survey:  Barclays
Capital , Concorde Securities, Cyrrus, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, ING,
Kepler  Capital Markets , Mediobanca, Raiffeisen Centrobank, UBS,
Wood & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
