R. Allen Stanford, after a month of
trial over allegations he led a $7 billion fraud, lost his bid
for a mistrial based on a prosecutor’s improper question that
defense lawyer Ali Fazel called a “skunk” in the jury box.  U.S. District Judge David Hittner in Houston instructed
jurors to disregard the question yesterday by Justice Department
attorney Andrew Warren, which implied that audit records from
Stanford’s Antigua bank were destroyed to hide wrongdoing.  “By putting that skunk into the jury box, they’ve created
a huge problem for me,” Fazel told the judge after the jury was
led from the courtroom.  Stanford, 61, has been on trial since Jan. 23 on charges he
led an investment fraud scheme centered on the sale of
certificates of deposit by his Antigua-based Stanford
International Bank Ltd. Stanford maintains he is innocent.  Warren’s question came on the second day of his cross-
examination of defense witness Morris Hollander, an accountant
with the global auditing firm Marcum Group LLP, who has
testified that the Stanford bank’s annual reports showed no
evidence of fraudulent activity.  Computer records of the bank’s auditor, C.A.S. Hewlett,
were destroyed after he died and Stanford was indicted, Warren
said in open court.  Question Withdrawn  “Are you aware that the firm erased the hard drives?”
Warren asked Hollander, drawing Fazel’s objection and motion for
a mistrial, the sixth such defense request in the trial.  When the jury returned, the judge told them the
prosecutor’s question wasn’t evidence and was withdrawn by order
of the court.  Hollander later testified that in the absence of the
underlying accounting work papers, the Stanford bank reports
issued to its investors could as easily be said to be accurate
as inaccurate.  “Isn’t relying on what the auditor says exists, sort of
like asking your children if they did their homework?” Warren
asked.  Hollander replied that while he trusted his children,
“they never asked me to audit their homework.”  Asked then if he was placing the same amount of trust in
Hewlett, the auditor responded, “That’s a professional trust,
yes.”  While Fazel’s co-counsel, Robert Scardino, told jurors at
the outset of the trial that Stanford would testify, the
financier hasn’t taken the witness stand.  Judge’s Order  Hittner yesterday told the defense lawyers they must turn
over to prosecutors any records they intend to rely upon in
questioning Stanford, if he testifies, at least 48 hours before
the start of his testimony.  Stanford sustained head injuries in a 2009 inmate-induced
jailhouse beating. He later developed an addiction to
prescription anti-anxiety medication necessitating almost nine
months of treatment at a federal prison hospital in  North
Carolina .  Hittner, after dismissing the jury for the day, told
attorneys for both sides yesterday that evidence of Stanford’s
medical condition would be inadmissible at the outset of any
testimony by the defendant. That ruling, he added, could be
revisited depending on what Stanford is asked and says.  The judge also said he would hear arguments on Feb. 27 over
whether statements Stanford made while in custody and deemed
legally incompetent to stand trial could be used against him if
he takes the witness stand.  The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  Texas  (Houston).  To contact the reporters on this story:
