The shilling weakened, snapping a
two-day gain as businesses sought to accumulate dollars after it
fell to the cheapest level in more a year versus  Kenya ’s
currency.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy weakened as
much as 0.5 percent and was trading 0.3 percent lower at 82.72
at 3:10 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. The shilling closed at
82.45 yesterday, the highest since Feb. 25, 2011.  “The shilling has weakened on account of growing demand
for dollars by businesses which are accumulating the currency
following the recent gains,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at
Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  Tanzania’s shilling appreciated against the dollar as local
businesses sold dollars to enable them meet their end of month
obligations. The currency of the second-biggest economy in East
Africa traded 0.7 percent higher at 1,589 per dollar.  “The shilling has gained due to customers selling dollars
to get the local currency to meet end-of month payment
obligations like salaries and taxes,” Hakim Sheik, a dealer
with Commercial Bank of Africa Tanzania Ltd., said by phone from
the commercial Capital,  Dar es Salaam .  The Ugandan shilling remained weakened 0.5 percent to
2,347.05 to the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
