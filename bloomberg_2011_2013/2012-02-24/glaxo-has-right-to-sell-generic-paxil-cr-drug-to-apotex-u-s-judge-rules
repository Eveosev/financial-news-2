GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  has the right to
sell an authorized copy of its Paxil CR antidepressant to Apotex
Inc., a U.S. judge ruled, denying a bid by  Mylan (MYL)  Inc. to block
such sales.  Mylan (MYL) , the generic-drug company which signed a two-year
licensing agreement in 2008 to market a copy of Paxil CR,
claimed that Glaxo breached that contract by working with
Toronto-based Apotex to sell a copy of the drug. U.S. District
Judge Joel Pisano ruled that the agreement allowed Glaxo to sell
generic Paxil CR to Apotex.  The license was “clear and unambiguous” and that let
London-based Glaxo choose whomever it wanted to work with,
Pisano ruled yesterday in federal court in Trenton,  New Jersey .  “The language plainly states that GSK may commence
marketing and selling of authorized generic Paxil CR after
Mylan’s two-year period of exclusivity,” Pisano ruled. “GSK
did exactly that. It marketed and sold authorized generic Paxil
CR to Apotex.”  The case is Mylan Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 10-cv-
4809, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
