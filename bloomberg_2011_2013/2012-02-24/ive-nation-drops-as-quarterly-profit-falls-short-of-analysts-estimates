Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the
world’s biggest ticket seller and concert promoter, dropped the
most in more than three months after fourth-quarter profit fell
short of some analysts’ estimates.  Live Nation, based in Beverly Hills, California, declined
6.6 percent to $9.81 at 11:36 a.m. New York time after
retreating as much as 10 percent to mark the biggest intraday
drop since Nov. 4.  Adjusted operating income fell 11 percent to $50.7 million
from $56.8 million a year earlier, the company said in a
 statement  yesterday. That missed the $53.2 million estimate of
 John Tinker , an analyst at Maxim Group LLC in New York with a
“buy” rating on the stock. Revenue slid 4.2 percent to $1.19
billion, exceeding his $1.11 billion  projection .  To contact the reporter on this story:
