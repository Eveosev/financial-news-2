The euro area’s economic slump eased
in February as companies and consumers grew more confident, the
 Eurocoin index  showed.  The gauge measuring economic activity in the 17-nation
region rose to minus 0.06 percent from minus 0.14 percent in
January, the London-based  Centre for Economic Policy Research 
and the  Bank of Italy , which co-produce the index, said today in
an e-mailed report.  The reading “is due mostly to less pessimistic evaluations
of firms and consumers,” according to the report.  The index, which includes price figures and stock-market
performances, industrial production and business and consumer
confidence readings, aims to provide a real-time estimate of
economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
