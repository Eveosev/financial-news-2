Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , the U.K’s
largest mortgage lender, said 71 percent of the loans in its
corporate real-estate business support unit were impaired at the
end of 2011 as tenant defaults hurt asset values.  Troubled loans accounted for about 15.2 billion pounds ($24
billion) of the unit’s 21.3 billion-pound book as of December,
Lloyds said in a statement today. The division helps distressed
businesses avoid closing by restructuring and selling loans.  “With a significant proportion of our assets supporting
property investments, tenant default is an area of continuing
vulnerability especially where the lending is underpinned by
secondary or tertiary assets,” the bank said.  Lloyds booked provisions of 5.63 billion pounds for
impairments at the unit last year. A year earlier it made 8.09
billion pounds of provisions, equal to 46.2 percent of the
unit’s impaired loans. The unit sold 4.8 billion pounds of real
estate through 2011 and has restructured 5 billion pounds of
loans to give customers longer to repay them.  “Outside of  London  and the Southeast, activity in the
corporate real estate market remains weak, in part due to
declining values and the focus on only prime properties and
prime tenants,” Lloyds said. “With a continuing high level of
loan maturities due over the next few years, refinancing risk
remains a market-wide issue.”  Properties outside London made up 80 percent of the unit’s
disposals by value last year, Richard Dakin, its managing
director, said by telephone. About 12 percent of all the assets
sold by the unit in 2011 were valued at less than 5 million
pounds each.  Lloyds reported a 2011 net loss of 2.8 billion pounds
today, wider than the previous year’s loss of 320 million
pounds. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio announced
an additional 200 million pounds in cost savings by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
