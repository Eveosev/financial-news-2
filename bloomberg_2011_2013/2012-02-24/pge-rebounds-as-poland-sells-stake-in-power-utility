PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s biggest power
utility, rebounded from a three-month low in Warsaw trading
after the government sold a stake in the company for 2.52
billion zloty ($809 million) yesterday.  The shares jumped as much as 2 percent to 19.75 zloty and
traded 0.8 percent higher at 19.53 zloty at 9:35 a.m. PGE closed
4.5 percent lower yesterday, slumping to the lowest since Nov.
15.  Poland’s Treasury Ministry sold the 7 percent stake in PGE
to institutional investors yesterday, according to a statement
on its website today. The transaction was the biggest state sale
since the 5.4 billion-zloty public offering of coal producer
Jastrzebska Spolkazloty Weglowa SA in June.  PGE’s weighting in the  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  will increase to 9.2
percent from 7.6 percent now, DM PKO BP SA brokerage wrote in a
