Cosan SA Industria & Comercio (CSAN3) ’s
offer to join control of  ALL America Latina Logistica SA (ALLL3)  may be
hindered by shareholders that didn’t take part in negotiations
and are holding talks with other bidders, Valor Economico
reported, without saying how it got the information  Cosan will meet next week with controlling shareholders of
the railroad operator who didn’t discuss its bid, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper said. Some of the shareholders, who have the
right to block the sugar and ethanol maker’s offer, have already
held talks with other potential buyers of their stakes, Valor
said.  Cosan agreed to buy 5.6 percent of ALL, or 49.1 percent of
the controlling block, from ALL board member Ricardo Arduni, his
wife Julia Dora Arduni and Chairman Wilson de Lara’s Global
Markets Investments, the newspaper said. The government’s BNDES
development bank and the Previ, Funcef and Petros pension funds
of state-run companies are among other controlling shareholders,
Valor said.  An outside firm representing Cosan said it couldn’t
immediately comment in an e-mailed response to questions.  ALL is  Latin America ’s largest railroad company. Cosan
jointly controls the world’s largest sugar-cane processor with
Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
