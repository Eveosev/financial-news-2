Sri Lanka ’s exports rose the most in
six months in December, as demand for garments, textiles, tea
and coconuts increased.  Overseas sales  increased 24.3 percent from a year earlier
to $905.5 million, after rising 11.6 percent in November, the
 Central Bank of Sri Lanka  said in a statement today. Imports
rose 33.7 percent to $1.91 billion, leaving a trade deficit of
$1 billion.  Sri Lanka devalued the rupee by 3 percent in November to
boost exports as  Europe ’s protracted debt crisis sapped global
growth. The central bank on Feb. 9 removed a currency trading
band after gross foreign-exchange reserves dropped by about 25
percent from almost $8.1 billion in July, following moves to
defend the local currency.  Earnings from textiles and garment exports in December rose
25.2 percent from a year earlier to $383.6 million, the central
bank said. Agricultural shipments gained 10.3 percent to $194
million, while the value of industrial exports rose 28.9 percent
to $703.2 million.  The island makes apparels for companies such as Marks &
Spencer Group Plc, Gap Inc. and Victoria’s Secret.  The central bank on Feb. 3 raised benchmark interest  rates 
for the first time since 2007 to contain credit growth and
inflation in the $50 billion economy, about a fifth of which is
made up of exports.  The monetary authority has said it aims to curtail import-
related credit to reduce the trade and current-account deficits,
and ensure that inflation remains at the “mid-single digit
levels” in the second half of 2012.  The nation is facing some balance of payments pressure,
Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said in January.  Sri Lanka aims to double shipments abroad to $20 billion by
2020 from an estimated $10 billion in 2011 as it reconnects with
global commerce after a 26-year civil war that ended in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
