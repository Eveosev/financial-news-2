A fire broke out at the CDM Max LLC
natural-gas processing plant in Acadia Parish,  Louisiana , after
an explosion today, injuring one man, according to a  report  by
KATC Channel 3 in Lafayette.  The fire at the Basile plant is under control and the state
police is allowing it to burn out, according to the report. The
man suffered burns to his upper body and is in stable condition
after being airlifted to a local hospital, according to
 katc.com , the station’s website.  Residents within a mile of the plant were ordered to
evacuate at 1:45 p.m. local time and the order was lifted an
hour later, according to KATC.  CDM Max is a subsidiary of  Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA)

Center header system accessing liquefied natural gas imports and
is connected to pipelines serving the region, according to the
company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
