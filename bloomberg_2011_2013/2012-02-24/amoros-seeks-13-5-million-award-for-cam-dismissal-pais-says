Maria Dolores Amoros, the former
general director of  Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM) , is seeking
10 million euros ($13.5 million) of compensation for being
dismissed from the failed lender, El Pais  reported .  Amoros attended a court hearing in Alicante,  Spain , today
to seek to have her dismissal overthrown, alleging that the move
violated her professional and personal dignity, the newspaper
said. Amoros was fired last September by the administrators of
the lender after its seizure by the Bank of Spain, El Pais said.  No one in CAM’s press office was immediately available to
comment when contacted by telephone today. It wasn’t possible to
trace Amoros in the Valencia region phone directory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
