Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  rose 0.6
percent to close at 2,311.89 in Warsaw, snapping a two-day
decline.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, jumped to a three-week high and
traded up 3.6 percent at 143.50 zloty as the metal advanced
after a report showed January U.S. new homes sales were higher
than expected.  PGE SA (PGE)  , the country’s largest power utility,
rebounded from a three-month low and traded 1.7 percent higher
to 19.70 zloty after the government sold a stake in the company
for 2.52 billion zloty ($810 million) yesterday.  “The impact of this transaction was one-time and now the
stock should recover from early losses,” Kamil Kliszcz, a
Warsaw-based analyst at BRE Bank SA, wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
