Taiwan ’s dollar snapped a three-day
decline on optimism an economic recovery in the U.S. will boost
exports and spur growth on the island.  Government bonds  were
steady.  The currency climbed 0.1 percent today to erase losses
earlier in the week. A report yesterday showed jobless claims in
the world’s largest economy held at a four-year low. Overseas
investors bought $1.4 billion more in Taiwanese stocks than they
sold this month through yesterday, exchange data show.  Taiwan’s currency may gain as the island’s “growth outlook
appears brighter now,” Wai Ho Leong and Joey Chew, Singapore-
based analysts at  Barclays Capital , wrote in a research note.
“The improvement in U.S. economic indicators is finally
filtering down to Taiwan.”  The local dollar appreciated to NT$29.582 against its U.S.
counterpart, from NT$29.596 yesterday, according to Taipei Forex
Inc. The currency has appreciated 2.4 percent this year and
Barclays said it may reach NT$27.50 in 12 months.  Asian  currencies  rose to a two-week high after  Greece  won a
130 billion euros ($174 billion) bailout on Feb. 21 and China
cut banks’ reserve-requirement ratio by half a percentage point
from today.  Taiwan’s economy grew 1.89 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier, the slowest pace in more than two years,
the statistics bureau said on Feb. 22. The government cut its
growth forecast for 2012 to 3.85 percent from 3.91 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 was steady at 1.278 percent versus 1.272 percent a week
ago, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The  benchmark
10-year rate  reached 1.260 percent on Feb. 16, the lowest
closing level since Dec. 19.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed for the week at 0.406
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
