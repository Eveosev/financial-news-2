Mauritius’s rupee headed for its
biggest weekly gain against the dollar since June after
investors converted foreign currency deposits into the local
currency.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s currency was unchanged at
28.95 per dollar by 12:05 p.m., in  Port Louis , the capital,
maintaining its weekly gain to 1.2 percent, set for the biggest
five-day increase since the week through June 3.  “We are most probably witnessing corporate foreign
currency holders converting their deposits into rupee on
reaching maturity,” Nitish Benimadhu, a  fund manager  at Port
Louis-based Anglo-Mauritius Financial Services Ltd, said in a
phone interview from the city. “Investors see the rupee as less
risky than the dollar and the euro, preferring to take a minimal
loss now than a bigger one at a later stage.”  Mauritius, with a population of 1.3 million people, is a
net importer of food and fuels.  Europe  is its main trading
partner, accounting for 63 percent of tourism arrivals and
biggest buyer of manufactured goods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
