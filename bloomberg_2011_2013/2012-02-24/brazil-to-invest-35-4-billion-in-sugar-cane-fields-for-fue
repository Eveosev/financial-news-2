Brazil ’s government plans to boost
investment in sugar-cane plantations by 60.5 billion reais
($35.4 billion) during the next four years to ensure an adequate
supply of crops for the nation’s ethanol industry.  The government plans to introduce measures aimed at
spurring the renewal of 6.4 million hectares (15.8 million
acres) of aging plantations and the development of 5.2 million
hectares of new fields, the Ministry of Agriculture said today
on its website. It didn’t say when the policies will be
announced.  Brazil is seeking to boost cane production after a shortage
of ethanol drove up prices last year and prompted the government
to cut the amount of the renewable fuel that must be blended
into gasoline, according to Salim Morsy, an analyst at Bloomberg
New Energy Finance.  “Utilization was a central problem in the cane industry
last year, with mills running at an average of 65 percent
capacity” because there wasn’t enough of the crops, Morsy said
in an interview.  The policies are designed to help Brazil restore its 25
percent ethanol-blend rate, which was cut to 20 percent in
October, and boost the number of flex-fuel vehicles to as much
as 55 percent of the country’s total fleet, according to the
statement. Flex-fuel cars run on pure ethanol or gasoline.  The industry invested about $700 million in new mills and
their accompanying cane plantations in 2011, down 68 percent
from the previous year, Morsy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
