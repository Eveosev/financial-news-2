The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission should start over with a new proposal of the so-
called Volcker rule that bans banks’ proprietary trading, said
SEC Commissioner  Troy Paredes .  “The most appropriate path forward from here would be a
re-proposal,” Paredes, one of two Republicans on the five-
member commission, said today during a  Washington  securities-law
conference. The “excessive complexity” of the initial proposal
and what he sees as potential harm to the global competitiveness
of U.S. firms could be helped with a “fresh start,” he said.  Asked earlier this week whether about 15,000 comment
letters will force regulators to re-propose this rule required
by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, SEC Chairwoman  Mary Schapiro  said
it depends on “how much the rule changes.” The statute  --
which also must be approved by four other agencies, including
the  Federal Reserve  and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- is
set to go into effect in July, and Schapiro said she doesn’t
know whether the rulemaking will be complete by then.  “By any measure, a huge volume of comments has come in
that we are obligated to digest thoughtfully,” Paredes said.
“Significant revisions will most likely be needed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
