Rutgers University  says it received
$500,000 from the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  to complete the buyout of
former football coach  Greg Schiano ’s contract.  Schiano left the  New Brunswick ,  New Jersey , school after
posting a 68-67 record in 11 seasons to coach the  National
Football League team  in January.  School spokesman E.J. Miranda said yesterday that the money
will go specifically to the athletic department, rather than the
university as a whole.  Rutgers paid Schiano $2.03 million, including bonuses, in
the fiscal year ended in June. His contract also got him an
$800,000 interest-free home loan from the school with $100,000
forgiven each year. E-mails sent to the school asking if Schiano
repaid the $300,000 remaining on the loan weren’t immediately
returned.  The contract called for him to pay $500,000 if he left the
school before the deal expired Dec. 31, 2016.  The school is trying to increase athletic department
revenue to balance its intercollegiate sports budget. The
athletic department’s $26.9 million subsidy in fiscal 2010 from
student fees and the school’s general fund was the most among
the 53 public universities in college football’s biggest
conferences, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
