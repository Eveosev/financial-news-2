J Front Retailing Co (3086) .,  Japan ’s
second-largest department-store operator, agreed to pay 30.1
billion yen ($374 million) for 33 percent of rival  Parco Co (8251) . to
add the fashion-oriented retailers’ customers.  J Front will pay 1,100 yen per share, 61 percent more than
yesterday’s closing price, for the entire stake held by
developer Mori Trust Co., Tokyo-based J Front said in a
statement today. Parco shares jumped following a report about
the sale in the Nikkei newspaper’s morning edition.  “Parco has negotiating power with the tenants and by
combining, J Front probably thinks it can improve its department
store business,” Mikihiko Yamato, deputy head of research for
JI  Asia  in Tokyo, said by telephone.  J Front is adding the  Parco (8251)  chain to help diversify its
clientele as Japan’s population shrinks and ages. The retailer
paid 8.2 billion yen for 40.5 percent stake in gift and sundry
shops operator StylingLife Holdings Inc. in a deal completed
March 30.  Department store sales  in Japan fell 1.1 percent in
January from a year earlier.  Parco surged 15 percent, the most in 14 years, to 782 yen
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. J Front rose 1.5
percent to 397 yen.  Parco’s second-biggest  shareholder  Aeon Co., which owns a
10 percent stake, said will continue holding the shares,  Koji Tsusue, a spokesman for Aeon, said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
