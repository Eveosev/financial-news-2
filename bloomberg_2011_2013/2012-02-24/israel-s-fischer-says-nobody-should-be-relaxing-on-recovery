Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer comments on the need for caution amid signs of a global
economic recovery. He spoke in an interview in  Jerusalem  on Feb.
20.  On the global economy:  “Nobody should be relaxing at this stage.”  “It’s important that we keep asking what can go wrong
next, because something will go wrong somewhere, sometime and
it’s important to try to anticipate where and what it might
be.”  On the European economy:  “There remains the problem of restoring European growth,
which hasn’t been dealt with yet and it’s very hard to see how
to deal with it.”  On the  U.S. economy :  “The U.S. economy is looking much better.”  “I’m interested in why the Fed’s forecasts appear to be
more cautious than those of most private forecasters.”  On U.S.  interest rates :  “Extending the zero interest-rate cut for another two
years -- that’s a pretty brave and pretty strong step.”  On the  European Central Bank :  “The fact that  Mario Draghi  came in and the ECB
immediately cut interest rates twice -- boom, boom; I thought
he’d wait -- indicates that he is brave; he sent the right
signal to the market.”  On regulation:  “One of my lessons from the last crisis is about the
importance of active supervision.”  On the U.S.:  “The U.S. has always risen to the occasion when it has had
to. I hope and expect that happens again.”  On the shekel:  “We’re comfortable with the current situation in the
foreign-exchange market.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
