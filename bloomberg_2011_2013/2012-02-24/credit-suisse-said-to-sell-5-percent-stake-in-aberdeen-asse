Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  sold a 5
percent stake in  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) , reducing its
holdings in the Scottish firm to less than 15 percent.  Credit Suisse sold the stake for regulatory reasons,
spokeswoman Suzanne Fleming said in a telephone interview. She
declined to comment further.  Canaccord Genuity and Singer Capital Markets managed the
sale, placing about 55 million shares at 240 pence a share, or
132 million pounds ($209 million), according to two people
familiar with the sale who declined to be identified because the
transaction is private.  Aberdeen issued 207.5 million new shares to Credit Suisse
after completing the purchase of some Credit Suisse funds in
2009. The Zurich-based firm originally held a stake equivalent
to 23.9 percent of Aberdeen following the transaction. The bank
owned 19.8 percent as of December last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The disposal now makes Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Aberdeen’s largest investor. It owns 18 percent of the company,
according to Bloomberg data.  Aberdeen’s shares fell 5.6 pence, or 2.2 percent, to 247.3
pence in  London  today, falling for a fifth consecutive session.
The stock has gained 17 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
