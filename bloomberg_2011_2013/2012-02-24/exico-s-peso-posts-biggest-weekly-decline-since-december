Mexico ’s peso posted its biggest
weekly drop since December amid concern  Latin America ’s second-
biggest economy may be slowing as domestic demand shows signs of
weakening.  The peso fell 0.6 percent to 12.9041 per  U.S. dollar  at 5
p.m. in Mexico City, from 12.8220 yesterday. The currency has
slid 1.1 percent this week, paring its advance in 2012 to 8
percent. It’s the biggest weekly decline since the period ended
Dec. 16.  While economic reports from the U.S., Mexico’s biggest
trade partner, have been strong, “you also saw some very
curious retail sales numbers in Mexico,”  Enrique Alvarez , the
head of Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal, said
by phone. “December was very weak on a number of fronts. So
there may be some considerations related to the strength of the
overall start of the year period domestically, aside from the
export factor.”  Retail sales rose 3.5 percent in December from the same
month the previous year, the government said on Feb. 22,
compared with a median forecast of a 4.1 percent increase in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  Purchases of new homes in the U.S. exceeded economists’
forecasts in January and a gauge of  consumer confidence  in the
world’s biggest economy topped estimates.  Mexico’s economy will grow 3.5 percent this year, compared
with a 3.9 percent expansion in 2011, central bank Governor
Agustin Carstens said yesterday at an event in Mexico City.  The yield on peso-denominated debt due in 2024 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.55 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.27
centavo to 129.82 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
