New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the
country’s biggest leisure company by market value, dropped to
the lowest level in almost three years after the European
Commission interim forecast a contraction in the economy in the
euro area, Mauritius’s biggest trading partner.  The  stock  retreated 2.1 percent, its biggest decline since
Jan. 25, at close in  Port Louis  the capital, to 71.50 rupees,
its weakest level since March 2009, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The EC expects the euro region economy to contract 0.3
percent in 2012, the commission said yesterday in its interim
spring forecast. The statement came after the Mauritian stock
market closed. Gross domestic product in  France , the main source
of tourists for the Indian Ocean island nation, will grow 0.4
percent after the economy expanded 1.7 percent in 2011,
according to the commission.  “The forecast is probably the main reason driving the
share price down today,” said Kishen Nadassen, a senior
research analyst at Port Louis-based CIM Stockbrokers Ltd., in a
phone interview from the city.  Tourism and textiles are Mauritius’s biggest foreign
exchange earners. Visitors from  Europe  accounted for 63 percent
of the total in 2011, led by France. Arrivals contracted in
December and January, two months of the peak period running from
October through to March, and declined 3 percent in January,
