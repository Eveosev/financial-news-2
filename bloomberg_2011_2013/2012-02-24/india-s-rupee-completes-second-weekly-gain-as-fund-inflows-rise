India ’s rupee completed a second
weekly advance after foreign investors stepped up purchases of
the nation’s bonds and stocks.  Overseas funds lifted  holdings  of rupee-denominated debt by
a total $98 million on Feb. 21 and Feb. 22, following net sales
of $275 million last week, according to exchange data. Global
money managers bought $501 million more local shares than they
sold over the two days. The nation’s financial markets were
closed on Feb. 20 for a local holiday.  “Inflows into debt are boosting the rupee,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a currency trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd.
in Mumbai. “Sentiment is positive, and equity flows are
supportive too.”  The rupee advanced 0.7 percent this week and 0.5 percent
today to 48.9450 per dollar in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency strengthened 8.4 percent
this year in  Asia ’s best exchange-rate gain.  The Securities & Exchange Board of India auctioned $5
billion of corporate debt-purchase quotas on Nov. 30 to
foreigners, who must utilize the allocations by Feb. 28 or let
them expire.  Three-month onshore rupee forward contracts traded at 50.06
a dollar, compared with 50.22 yesterday, while offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 50.09 from 50.22. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
