Used car parts, plus a little auto
paint -- that’s all it took for John Chamberlain to make
explosive and sensual sculptures throughout his long career.  The Guggenheim has assembled a retrospective of his work,
including “Doomsday Flotilla” and the 16-foot aluminum arc
“Sphinxgrin Two.” He was working on this exhibition when he
died in Dec. 2011.  “John Chamberlain: Choices” runs through May 13 at the
Guggenheim, 1071 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-423-3500;

Twelve Parts.” (No worries: two intermissions, plus an hour-
long dinner break.)  It’s part of the Tune-In Music Festival at the Park Avenue
Armory celebrating the composer’s 75th birthday.  On Sunday afternoon, there’s a concert with contemporary
musicians, including  Nico Muhly , Tania Leon and Glass’s singer-
songwriter son, Zack, who will also talk about their craft.  The Festival concludes Sunday evening with Glass’s
“Another Look at Harmony -- Part IV,” written for organ and
100 voices.  At 643 Park Ave. Information: +1-212-933-5812;

Academy Awards: hear classic speeches from Oscar winners
reinterpreted by funny people, including Michael Cyril
Creighton, Julie Klausner, Michael Musto and Molly Pope.  It’s hosted by Ryan Raftery as  Billy Crystal , and no celeb
is safe.  “You Like Me: An Evening of Classic Acceptance Speeches”
was created by New Yorker writer Michael Schulman and memoirist
Rachel Shukert.  At Ars Nova, 511 W. 54th St. Information: +1-212-489-9800;
 http://www.arsnovanyc.com .  Saturday Night  Let Sharon Van Etten seduce you on Saturday at the  Bowery
Ballroom .  On her new album, “Tramp,” the Tennessee-via-Brooklyn
singer-songwriter still sounds bruised, but her spine has grown
steely.  There’s a pulsing heat in her new songs which never lose
her trademark intimacy.  Opening for her: baroque indie pop specialists Shearwater.  At 6 Delancey St. Information: +1-212-533-2111;
 http://www.boweryballroom.com .  Sunday  You’ve seen her in a thousand guises, from film noir
actresses, aging socialites, clergymen and clowns: photographer
 Cindy Sherman  has used herself as a model to explore the nature
and power of images. She’s there, yet she isn’t.  The  Museum of Modern Art ’s retrospective has more than 170
photographs, including 2010 murals having their U.S. premiere.  Runs through June 11 at 11 W. 53rd St. Information: +1-212-
708-9400;  http://www.moma.org .  Drop by the museum’s Cafe 2 for refreshment: Start with a
Mimosa, then try the cavatelli with chicken, mushrooms and white
beans. Open Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Sunday Matinee  Edward Albee ’s “The Lady From Dubuque” was a flop when it
opened in 1980, closing after a dozen performances.  The formidable Jane Alexander takes on the title role in
the Signature Theatre’s revival of the play, directed by David
Esbjornson.  In a typical living room, three young couples drink, play
games, engage in snarky wrangling -- no one really facing the
sad truth that one of them is dying.  Come early and admire the new Frank Gehry-designed theater
complex.  In previews at 480 W. 42nd St. for a March 5 opening.
