Telefonica SA (TEF) ,  Spain ’s biggest phone
company, predicts its profit margin will continue to drop this
year after 2011 earnings slumped because of weakening demand
amid the European debt crisis.  Profitability based on operating income before depreciation
and amortization, or Oibda, fell to 32.2 percent in 2011 from
42.4 percent, Madrid-based Telefonica said in a statement today.
The decline will continue this year, although at a slower rate,
the company said.  Rising unemployment and weakening demand prompted Chief
Executive Officer Cesar Alierta to slash the Spanish workforce,
halt major mergers and acquisitions and cut the dividend in
December for the first time in a decade.  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ,
 Italy ’s largest phone company, today reduced its 2011 dividend.
 Telefonica (TEF) ’s Oibda dropped to 20.2 billion euros ($27 billion)
from 25.8 billion euros in 2010, missing the 21.1 billion-euro
average estimate of analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “The trend in margins is just falling, falling and
falling, which is really worrisome,” said Peter Braendle, who
helps manage about $60 billion at Zurich-based  Swisscanto Asset
Management AG.  “It shows the tough environment that Telefonica
as well as other telecoms are facing.”  Telefonica fell as much as 1.3 percent to 12.72 euros in
Madrid trading tand was down 0.5 percent as of 9:30 a.m. Before
today, the stock dropped 28 percent in the last 12 months,
making Telefonica the fifth-worst performer in the 34-member
 Bloomberg Europe Telecommunication Index. (BEUTELE)   Recession, Unemployment  Spain, with a 23 percent unemployment rate, will relapse
into a recession in 2012 and additional austerity measures may
worsen the slump, the European Commission said this week,
forecasting the country’s economy will contract 1 percent this
year after expanding 0.7 percent in 2011. Private consumption
will be “significantly weaker” this year, weighed down by
austerity and “persistently high” unemployment, the commission
said.  Alierta told investors last year that revenue  will rise  1
percent to 4 percent annually through 2013 from an adjusted base
of 63.1 billion euros in 2010 and that Oibda is forecast to be
in the “upper 30’s” in percentage terms.  Telefonica’s full-year sales rose 3.5 percent to 62.8
billion euros, in line with analyst estimates. Sales will grow
more than 1 percent this year, the company said today.  “Telefonica’s guidance for sales growth is still good as
this is something you don’t see for the rest of the industry,”
Andres Bolumburu, a Madrid-based analyst at  Banco Sabadell ,
said via phone. “The reduction in margins is significant, but
still quite reasonable given the difficult environment.”  Dividend Cuts  France Telecom SA (FTE)  this week became the latest European
phone operator to back away from payout projections to conserve
cash amid the European debt crisis, following  Telekom Austria AG (TKA) 
and the cut by Telefonica in December.  Germany ’s  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE)  yesterday confirmed its dividend forecast.  Telecom Italia today reported an 8.7 percent increase in
2011 revenue to almost 30 billion euros, beating analyst
estimates, helped by growth in Latin America. The operator
forecast “broadly stable” earnings and profit for this year.  Telecom Italia’s board proposed dividends of about 900
million euros for 2011, down from 1.2 billion euros in 2010,
“in light of the recent worsening of the macroeconomic climate
and the goal to maintain the  credit rating ,” the Milan-based
company said.  Telefonica on Dec. 15 reduced its 2012 dividend forecast by
14 percent, abandoning a policy set up two years ago, as it
cited market conditions that have changed “significantly.”  Alierta is also counting on  Latin America ’s economic growth
to win back investors. Sales in Latin America climbed 13.5
percent to 29.2 billion euros last year while Oibda dropped 20.2
percent to 10.9 billion euros.  “2011 has been key in the transformation process of
Telefonica,” Alierta said today. “In a difficult environment,
our strong diversification and our ability to adapt have allowed
us to obtain solid results.  To contact the reporters on this story:
