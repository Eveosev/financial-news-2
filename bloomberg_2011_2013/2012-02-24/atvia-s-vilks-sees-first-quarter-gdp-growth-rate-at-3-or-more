Latvia’s  economy  will expand at
least 3 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier,
Finance Minister Andris Vilks said, citing tax revenue exceeding
the government’s target.  “The economy will most likely grow by at least 3 percent,
if not by 4 percent or more,” said Vilks today in an interview
with the Latvian Independent Television program  900 Seconds 
today.  Latvia’s economy expanded a preliminary 5 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to the central
statistics bureau. The growth rate may slow to 2.1 percent this
year, the European Commission said yesterday, cutting its
estimate from 2.5 percent.  The budget surplus was 82 million lati ($157 million) last
month as  tax revenue  was 9.6 percent more than planned, the
 Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today. The
government expects economic growth to slow to 2.5 percent this
year and targets a budget deficit of 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product, so it can adopt the euro in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
