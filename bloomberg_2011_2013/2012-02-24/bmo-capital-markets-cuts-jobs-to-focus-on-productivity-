Bank of Montreal ’s investment-
banking unit is paring jobs to focus on “productivity,”
according to bank spokesman Paul Deegan.  Bank of Montreal laid off 60 people in its North American
capital-markets unit, with traders in equity, foreign exchange
and mortgage-banking operations affected, Dow Jones Newswires
reported today, citing an unidentified person. Deegan wouldn’t
confirm the number of people affected.  “We continue to build our North American platform with a
unified approach to client coverage while ensuring staffing
levels are commensurate with the capital markets environment,”
Deegan said in an e-mailed statement. “The reductions are part
of our focus on productivity and we would expect to continue to
be hiring over the course of the year as we grow our business.”  Toronto-based  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  is  Canada ’s fourth-biggest
bank by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
