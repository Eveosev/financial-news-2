One of the world’s best-known
collections of golfing memorabilia is to be sold at a London
auction valued at 2 million pounds ($3.1 million).  Bolivian businessman Jaime Ortiz-Patino, the owner of the
 Valderrama Golf Club  in  Spain , amassed the material over 25
years. The 400 lots will be sold by  Christie’s International (CHRS)  on
May 30, the U.K.-based auction house said in an e-mail today.  Ortiz-Patino, born in Paris in 1930, is the grandson of the
Bolivian industrialist Simon Patino, known as the king of tin.
He acquired the Robert Trent Jones-designed course at
Sotogrande, Andalucia, in 1984. He renamed it Valderrama and put
his collection in its museum. The course was the venue of the
1997 Ryder Cup tournament.  “It’s going to be quite a sale,” Kenley Matheny, director
of the Florida-based memorabilia specialists The Golf Auction,
LLC, said in an interview. “Collections don’t get much better
than this.”  Items range from a 17th-century iron club owned by a
founding member of the Old Course,  St. Andrews , estimated at as
much as 100,000 pounds, to a 1934 program for the inaugural
Masters at the Augusta National, priced as much as 10,000
pounds.  The market for golfing memorabilia has cooled since the
late 1980s and 1990s, when prices for rarities were pushed up by
competition between Ortiz-Patino and Japanese collectors.  A putter owned by the  Royal Perth Golfing Society  made its
way to Valderrama after selling at Christie’s, Glasgow, for
95,000 pounds in 1998. It will be re-offered in May with an
estimate of 70,000 pounds to 100,000 pounds.  Chinese Demand  “It’s not as crazy as it was when a lot of Japanese were
buying,” Matheny said. “There has been a shift in taste away
from hickory clubs to more modern winners’ medals and trophies.
There are a lot of golf courses being built in  China  and there’s
a definite uptick in demand from that region. They like to put a
few old things with a wow factor in the club house.”  The most highly valued lot is the early 1920s John Lavery
painting “The Golf Course, North Berwick.” Estimated at
200,000 pounds to 300,000 pounds, this sold at the same London
auction room for 456,000 pounds in 2005.  A wooden putter used by Old Tom Morris and Young Tom
Morris, who between them won eight Open Championships in the
mid-19th century, is estimated to sell for as much as 70,000
pounds, while a selection of the “Featherie” golf balls they
would have used -- made out of compacted goose feathers stuffed
into cowhide -- may fetch as much as 20,000 pounds each.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
