U.S. stocks  rose this week, driving
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level since 2008,
after  Greece  got a bailout and better-than-expected data boosted
confidence in the world’s largest economy.  Energy companies surged 1.9 percent, the most among 10  S&P
500 (SPXL1)  industries, as crude oil futures exceeded $109 a barrel.
 Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  rallied 25 percent, the most in the  S&P
500 , after announcing real estate sales and a rights offering.
 Technology companies  in the stock index advanced an eighth
straight week even as  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  tumbled 10 percent.
 Procter & Gamble Co . added 2.8 percent after saying it will cut
5,700 jobs.  The S&P 500 added 0.3 percent to 1,365.74, the seventh gain
in the past eight weeks. It exceeded last year’s high of
1,363.61 as a 24 percent rally since October restored $3.2
trillion to American equity values. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average (INDU)  climbed 33.08 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,982.95. The
measure exceeded 13,000 for the first time since 2008.  “You’re seeing a whiz of optimism mainly because of a lack
of negative news out of  Europe  and moderate growth in the
U.S.,”  Matt McCormick , who helps oversee about $5.1 billion at
Bahl & Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati, said in a phone interview.
“This trend will continue until either of these two variables
change.”  European finance ministers this week approved 130 billion
euros ($175 billion) in aid for Greece by tapping into European
Central Bank profits and coaxing investors into providing more
debt relief to shield the region from a default. In the U.S.,
data showed applications for jobless benefits stayed at the
lowest level since 2008,  consumer confidence  rose to a one-year
high and purchases of new homes exceeded economists’ forecasts.  No 1% Losses  The S&P 500 has gone without losing 1 percent for 39
consecutive days, the longest streak since the 40 days through
May 9, 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the
gauge surpassed last year’s peak set on April 29, its price-
 earnings (SPX)  ratio is 9 percent  cheaper  than it was then as profit
growth outpaced stock prices.  Earnings topped analysts’ estimates at 68 percent of the
440 companies in the index that released results since Jan. 9.
The S&P 500 trades at 14 times reported earnings, compared with
a high of 15.4 in April and the average since 1954 of 16.4
times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The lower valuation reflects lingering concern among
investors over Europe’s debt crisis, according to Jeff Sica, who
oversees $1 billion of assets as president of SICA Wealth
Management in Morristown, New Jersey.  ‘Quick to Sell’  “The more in depth they get to looking at what’s coming
out of Europe, the more likely investors are going to be quick
to sell,” Sica said in a phone interview.  Energy stocks in the S&P 500 climbed this week as crude oil
futures increased 6.3 percent, completing a seven-day winning
streak that’s the longest in two years. Prices rose as tensions
with Iran threatened supplies while signs of economic growth
boosted the outlook for demand.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest U.S. energy company,
advanced 2.3 percent to $109.08.  Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR)  rose 7.3 percent to $22.31 after the
largest land-drilling contractor beat analysts’ earnings
forecasts for a second straight quarter. Profit excluding some
items was 53 cents a share in the last three months of 2011,
higher than the 50-cent average in a Bloomberg survey.  Sears rose for a fourth week, rallying 25 percent to
$68.31. The retailer controlled by hedge-fund manager  Edward
Lampert  said it plans to raise as much as $770 million by
selling 11 buildings and separating its Hometown and Outlet
shops as well as some hardware stores through a rights offering.  Winning Streak  The S&P 500  Information Technology index  added 1 percent,
completing the longest streak of weekly gains since 2009.
 Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  rallied 11 percent to $143.64. The largest
seller of online customer-management software reported fourth-
quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates after adding
features and pushing into social media. The company boosted its
sales forecast for the current fiscal year.  Hewlett-Packard slumped 10 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$26.64, after the company’s fiscal second-quarter profit
forecast missed analysts’ estimates as consumers curtail
personal-computer purchases.  Procter & Gamble rose 2.8 percent to $66.71. The world’s
largest consumer-products company will eliminate the jobs by the
end of its fiscal year in June 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
