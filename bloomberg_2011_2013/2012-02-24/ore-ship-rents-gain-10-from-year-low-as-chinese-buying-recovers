Earnings for Capesize ships that
haul steel-making raw materials including  iron ore  and coal
advanced for a third day, rising 10 percent from this year’s
low, as Chinese cargo buying boosted vessel demand.  Daily returns for Capesize vessels rose to $5,699 today,
according to the  Baltic Exchange , a London-based provider of
freight costs on 29 dry-bulk routes. Rents fell to this year’s
low of $5,158 a day Feb. 21, the exchange data show.  China  is
the top global steel producer.  Increased Capesize vessel bookings partly boosted rates
that plunged 79 percent since the start of the year, according
to Peter Norfolk, a London-based analyst at derivatives broker
Freight Investor Services Ltd.  Prices (TSIPIO62)  for iron ore imported into
the Chinese city of Tianjin increased for a fifth session,
gaining 0.2 percent to $139 a metric ton, according to figures
from The Steel Index Ltd.  “There’s been a handful of fixtures out of Brazil and
 Australia  which has likely pushed rates up,” Norfolk said by
phone. “There’s clearly some Chinese buying at these low
freight levels and that’s sufficient to move rates up slightly.
Rates are still very low.”  Earnings increased for three of the four classes ships
tracked by the Baltic Dry Index, a measure of commodity shipping
costs. The gauge added 1.7 percent, rising to 718 points.  Daily hire costs for Panamaxes, the biggest ships that can
navigate the Panama Canal, declined 1.4 percent to $6,705,
according to the exchange.  Supramaxes (BSRATCR) , which carry about 25
percent less than Panamaxes, rose 2.3 percent to $6,920.
 Handysizes (BHSATCR) , the smallest ships tracked by the index, gained 0.7
percent to $5,980.  To contact the reporter on this story:
