Japanese billionaire Kazuo Okada
won’t attend a planned meeting today by  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  to
discuss his removal from the casino operator’s board over
allegations he made illegal payments to Philippine regulators.  “I disagree with the decision to remove me as a director
because it is based on false and misleading assertions,” Okada,
chairman of  Universal Entertainment Corp. (6425) , wrote in a letter
addressed to Wynn Macau and e-mailed to Bloomberg News. The
meeting’s result is predetermined so attendance “would
therefore be futile,” he said in the letter dated yesterday.  Wynn Macau Vice Chairman Allan Zeman yesterday said the
board was planning a meeting to consider the ouster of Okada,
accused by its parent, Wynn Resorts Ltd., of making illegal
payments to the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. Universal
Entertainment’s 20 percent stake in Wynn Resorts, held through a
U.S.-based unit was forcibly redeemed for about 30 percent less
than the market price over the alleged payments.  Universal reiterated yesterday that it intends to seek an
injunction against the stake redemption and has called Wynn’s
moves “outrageous.”  Wynn Macau spokeswoman Katharine Liu couldn’t immediately
be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
