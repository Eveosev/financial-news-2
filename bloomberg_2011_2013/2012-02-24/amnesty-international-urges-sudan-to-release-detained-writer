Amnesty International  urged  Sudan  to
release detained writer and academic Mohamed Zein al-Abbeddin,
saying he’s “at risk of torture and other ill treatment.”  El-Abbeddin was detained on Feb. 20 by the National
Security and Intelligence Service after he wrote an article in
the closely held al-Tayar newspaper criticizing Sudanese
President Umar al-Bashir, the security forces and companies
owned by the ruling  National Congress Party , his lawyer, Nabil
Adib, said on Feb 22.  The government has brought charges against at least 10
writers and journalists since March last year for criticizing
al-Bashir’s administration, he said. The security forces have
closed down two independent newspapers -- Alwan and al-Rai al-
Shaab -- since the start of the year, according to Adib.  El-Abbeddin, dean of the College of Higher Education at the
Al Zaiem Al Azhari University in Khartoum, has been
incommunicado since he was taken to the offices of NISS’s
political wing four days ago, Amnesty said, citing people it
didn’t identify.  “El-Abbeddin is suffering from a number of health problems,
which require him to take regular medication,” the London-based
advocacy group said. “His family delivered his medication to the
NISS offices where they believe he is still held, but they were
not allowed to see him.”  The authorities seized copies of the al-Tayar newspaper
edition that carried el-Abbeddin’s article on Feb. 20 and
suspended publication two days later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
