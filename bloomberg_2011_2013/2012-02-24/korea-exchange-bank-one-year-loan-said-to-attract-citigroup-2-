Citigroup Inc. is joining a loan for
 Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  of at least $250 million equivalent,
according to three people familiar with the matter.  The loan, denominated in U.S. dollars and yen, may be
increased from the original target of $250 million equivalent
because Citigroup has joined, one of the people said, asking not
to be identified because the details are private.  The deal is in progress, with details still not decided,
KEBâ€™s spokesman in  Seoul , Lee Sun Hwan, said by telephone today.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Bank of America
Corp., Commerzbank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Landesbank Baden-
Wuerttemberg, Standard Chartered Plc, Mizuho Corporate Bank
Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. are
also lending to the one-year club facility, another person
familiar with the matter said on Feb. 20.  The loan pays an all-in rate, which includes margin and
fees, of about 150 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate for the dollar portion, the person said. Proceeds
will be used in part to refinance previous debt, the person
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
