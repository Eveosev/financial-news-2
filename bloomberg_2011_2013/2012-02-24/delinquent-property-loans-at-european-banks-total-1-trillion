European banks hold about 750
billion euros ($1 trillion) of delinquent real-estate loans,
putting them under pressure to sell assets, according to a study
by the  European Business School .  Divestments by the banks will create “attractive”
opportunities for buyers of loans or properties, particularly
residential and retail buildings outside of prime locations, the
Oestrich-Winkel, Germany-based school said in a report presented
at its annual property conference.  By 2014, the shortfall in debt funding for maturing loans
will rise to 200 billion euros as banks reduce their property-
loan books and shrink balance sheets to meet higher  capital
requirements , according to the study. Non-core lending,
financing not connected to a bank’s main businesses, totaled 1
trillion euros, half of it by German institutions, it found.
That adds to pressure to sell loans and assets.  “The problem will take years to solve, but the process is
under way,” said Ralph Winter, chairman of Corestate Capital
AG. The Zug, Switzerland-based real estate asset manager
sponsored the study, which was compiled by the business school’s
Real Estate Management Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
