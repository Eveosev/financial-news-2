Emerging-market stocks advanced for
a second week as oil neared a ten-month high and data from the
U.S. to  South Korea  signaled economic growth around the world
may be steadying.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  rose 0.8 percent to
1,067.56 at the close in  New York , pushing it 0.5 percent higher
over the past week, the second straight weekly advance. Russian

more than two years.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  climbed 2.3 percent
in  Sao Paulo  and  PetroChina Co. (601857) ,  China ’s biggest oil company,
gained 1.2 percent.  New home sales  in the U.S. exceeded analysts’ estimates,
Commerce Department data showed, a day after jobless claims held
at a four-year low.  Consumer confidence  also improved in the
U.S., South Korea and  France . Oil reached the highest price
since May 3 after a seven-day advance, as escalating tension
with  Iran  threatens supplies and on speculation an expanding
global economy will boost demand.  “There are mounting supply side constraints and therefore
the risk to  oil prices  is clearly skewed to the upside,”  Benoit Anne , head of emerging-market strategy at Societe Generale SA,
said by phone from  London . “The market has clearly picked that
up and it’s clearly focused on that today.”  Crude oil for April delivery rose $1.94, or 1.8 percent, to
$109.77 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since May 3. Oil may rise next week as
sanctions against Iran tighten, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of analysts.  Steady Jobless  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has gained 17 percent this
year, while the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of developed nations advanced

the MSCI World.  The  iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index exchange-traded
fund , the most-traded ETF that tracks developing nation-shares,
gained 1 percent to $44.19.  U.S. new home sales fell 0.9 percent to a 321,000 annual
pace in January, above the median estimate for 315,000 in a
Bloomberg survey. Applications for U.S.  jobless benefits  were
unchanged in the week ended Feb. 18 at 351,000, the fewest since
March 2008. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final
index of consumer sentiment increased to 75.3 in February from
75 last month.  The  Bovespa stock index  gained 0.2 percent, the first rise
this week. Petroleo Brasileiro’s 2.3 percent jump was the
biggest in a week.  Russia’s  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 3.7 percent as 29 of 30 members
advanced.  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , the country’s gas export monopoly, gained
3.6 percent and Lukoil jumped the most since October 2009.  Kospi Jumps  The ruble appreciated 1.7 percent to 29.1850 per dollar,

the best performer this week, gaining 2.8 percent versus the
dollar.  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  added 0.6 percent, its biggest
rise in a week, as the central bank said consumer confidence
jumped to a three-year high. The  Shanghai Composite index  rose
for a sixth day, boosting gains for the week to 3.5 percent.  Indian stocks had their first weekly loss this year on
concern oil price gains may fuel inflation, preventing the
 Reserve Bank  of India from easing monetary policy. The  BSE India
Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, slid 0.9 percent today, extending
its weekly loss to 2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
