Aeroports de Paris, operator of the
French capital’s Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, will have
a new source of revenue this year with the opening of new
structures at one of the airports, the company’s chief executive
officer told  Les Echos  in an interview.  The company is inaugurating satellite 4 of terminal 2E in
the Charles de Gaulle airport and a connecting building between
two terminals, and will see revenue from the former as of July
and the latter as of April, Chief Executive Pierre Graff said.  “2012 is an uncertain year,” he told the newspaper. “But
we remain reasonably optimistic. We maintain a hypothesis of
moderate growth in air traffic, sales and Ebitda. After all,
airlines still are expecting to increase their programs.”  Graff said in the interview that the company has looked at
investment opportunities at airports in Brazil and  Spain , as
well as Istanbul. He also said the Croatian government is
looking at ADP’s offerings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
