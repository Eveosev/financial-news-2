Italian local banks, including Banca
di Credito Cooperativo di Fano and Banca Reggiana Credito
Cooperativo, issued more than 550 million euros ($741 million)
in state-backed bonds, the Italian exchange said in a  filing 
yesterday.  Italy approved a measure in December that allows the
Treasury to back bonds issued by banks in order to obtain loans
from the  European Central Bank . Financial institutions will ask
the ECB for 470 billion euros in three-year funds for allotment
on Feb. 29, the median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
