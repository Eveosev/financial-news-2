SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd., operator of
the Zurich bourse, will start accepting collateral from U.K.
companies as it extends its risk-management service for
structured products beyond domestic banks.  The Collateral Secured Instruments service, or COSI, takes
guarantees from Swiss companies that issue securitized
derivatives and uses them to reimburse investors in case of a
default. The exchange started the service in 2009 after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and holds about $2.5
billion in collateral at present. It has been working with
lawyers and users to overcome differences in national bankruptcy
laws in order to extend the service, the company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “We have carefully been working on the proper approach to
make COSI accessible to international collateral providers,”
Christian Katz, chief executive officer of the Swiss stock
exchange, said in the statement. “The first step has now been
taken with the connection to the  United Kingdom .”  Zurich-based SIX operates  Scoach , an exchange for
structured products, with Frankfurt-based  Deutsche Boerse AG. (DB1) 
The Swiss stock exchange, home to Nestle SA and UBS AG, is the
largest of  Europe ’s bourses to remain closely held.  SIX, owned by about 150 brokers and banks that are also
users, was formed in a  three-way merger  at the start of 2008. It
offers securities trading, post-trade services, financial
information and data and payment transactions. The group is
owned by Swiss banks including UBS and Credit Suisse Group AG
and asset managers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
