MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3) , the
iron-ore producer controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , climbed to the highest in more than eight months as
prices for the steelmaking ingredient increase.  MMX, based in  Rio de Janeiro ,  gained  4.1 percent to 9.39
reais in Sao Paulo today, the highest since May 31. The stock
has climbed about 41 percent this year, the biggest increase in
the Brazilian benchmark Bovespa index.  Iron-ore prices rose for a fifth straight day, reaching the
highest level in ten days on expectation Chinese measures to
stem a decline in economic growth will stoke demand. China, the
world’s biggest consumer of the raw material, cut bank’s reserve
requirements on Feb. 18 to boost lending.  The  price  of ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to
the Chinese port of Tianjin gained 0.2 percent to $139 a metric
ton today, after dropping to a two-month low last week,
according to the London-based information provider The Steel
Index Ltd.  Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-ore producer,  rose  0.4
percent to 42.97 reais, the highest since Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
