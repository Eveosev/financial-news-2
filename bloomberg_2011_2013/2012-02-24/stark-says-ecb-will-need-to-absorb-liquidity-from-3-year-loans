Former European Central Bank
Executive Board member Juergen Stark said the ECB will at some
stage need to absorb the liquidity it is providing to banks
through its three-year loans or risk pushing up price
expectations.  The central bank should “be prepared to absorb this
liquidity at a certain point in time in order to avoid” driving
up “inflation expectations,” Stark said in an interview with
CNBC Television today.  The ECB will next week make its second offering of three-
year loans, a move intended to relieve liquidity strains in the
region as officials work to limit the fallout from the debt
crisis. The three-year funds cost the average of the ECB’s
benchmark interest rate, currently at a record-low 1 percent,
over the period of the loans and banks have the option of
repaying them after a year.  Stark also said the euro area will overcome this crisis and
emerge “stronger than before.”  “The risk that the euro area will break up is really
exaggerated,” he told CNBC. “There will be no political
agreement to break up the euro. It will continue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
