Jeremy Lin was held to one basket
and the  Miami Heat  made 12 steals in a 102-88 defeat of the  New
York Knicks , who were playing a road game against a winning team
for the first time since Linsanity began.  Lin had eight points on 1-of-11 shooting, three assists and
eight turnovers as the Knicks lost for the third time in their
last five games after a seven-game winning streak that began
when Lin took over at point guard.  Chris Bosh scored 25 points,  Dwyane Wade  had 22 and  LeBron James  added 20 for the Heat (27-7), which won its eighth
straight game. Miami entered the game tied with Oklahoma City
for the best record in the NBA. The Thunder host the  Los Angeles
Lakers  later tonight.  Carmelo Anthony  led the Knicks (17-18) with 19 points and
Amar’e Stoudemire had 13 at AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami.  Lin, 23, is the first Harvard University graduate in the
NBA since  Ed Smith  in 1954 and the first Chinese- or Taiwanese-
American to play in the league. He was cut by two other clubs
before signing with the Knicks on Dec. 27.  The Knicks have now won nine of their 12 games since Lin
started running the offense on Feb. 4. Six of those wins have
come at Madison Square Garden, and none of the three road
victories has come against a team with a winning record.  Miami led 24-20 after the first quarter, during which Lin
had two points, two assists and three turnovers. The Knicks
opened the second quarter with a 10-2 run that included a pair
of 3-pointers by Steve Novak while Lin was on the bench.  The Heat led 51-47 at the half. Lin had two points, two
assists and six turnovers at the break, and was 1-for-5 shooting
-- including an air ball on a 10-foot floater midway through the
second period. Miami had 11 steals in the first half.  Miami was ahead 80-66 entering the fourth period. Lin’s six
points in the third period all came on free throws.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
