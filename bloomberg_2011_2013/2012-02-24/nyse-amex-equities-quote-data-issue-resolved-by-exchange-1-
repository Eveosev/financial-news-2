The New York Stock Exchange and NYSE
Amex equities markets experienced an issue today with data feeds
for quotations, according to an e-mailed notice.  The problem that affected OpenBook Ultra has been resolved,
the company said. NYSE trading systems operated normally and
consolidated trade and quote processing wasn’t affected, NYSE
said.  The issue affected customers receiving  NYSE Euronext (NYX) ’s
proprietary data feeds for NYSE and Amex quotations,  Richard Adamonis , a spokesman for the New York-based company, said in a
phone interview today. Public data feeds were unaffected, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
