Echo Entertainment Group Ltd. (EGP) , owner
of the only casino in Sydney, surged by a record after rival
 Crown Ltd. (CWN)  doubled its stake in the company to 10 percent and
sought regulatory approval to buy more.  The  stock  jumped 13 percent to A$4.30 at the close of
Sydney trading, the biggest gain since the company was spun off
from  Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. (TAH)  in June.  Crown, the casino operator controlled by billionaire  James Packer , today said it held a derivative that will be settled by
the delivery of 68.8 million shares, 10 percent of the stock on
issue. The Melbourne-based company will pay about A$257 million
($276 million) to acquire the shares, it said in a filing. Crown
previously held a derivative for 4.9 percent of Echo that has
now been terminated, it said.  Echo’s constitution prohibits any single person from
controlling more than 10 percent of the company without getting
approval from gaming regulators in New South Wales and
Queensland states, where it operates a total of four casinos.  “Crown is seeking these consents so that it has the
ability to increase its voting power in Echo beyond 10
percent,” it said.  Crown fell 1.5 percent to A$8.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
