Acer Inc. (2353) , the world’s fourth-
largest computer maker, said its U.S. affiliate filed a lawsuit
against Samsung Electronics Co. to challenge a non-compete
agreement signed by an executive it plans to hire.  Acer is in talks to hire Scott Ledterman, who has worked at
Samsung, and filed the lawsuit as a precautionary action because
of the non-compete clause, Henry Wang, spokesman for the Taipei-
based company said by phone today. He didn’t name the position
to be filled by Ledterman, who is named in the court filing as a
plaintiff in the case.  Ryan Crosner, an attorney at Rutan & Tucker LLP
representing the plaintiffs, declined to comment when reached by
phone at his office in  Costa Mesa , California. Ledterman
couldn’t be reached for comment. Samsung declined to comment as
it wasn’t immediately able to confirm the suit, Seoul-based
spokesman  James Chung  said by telephone.  The case is Acer America Corp., et al. v. Samsung
Electronics America, Inc., et al., 5:12-CV00914, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
