Skye Bank Plc (SKYEBANK) , a Nigerian lender,
reached the highest level in two months as investors bought the
stock in anticipation that the bank will pay dividends when it
announces full-year 2011 results as soon as next week.  The stock rose 4 percent to 4.16 naira as of the 2:30 p.m.
in Lagos, the commercial capital, the highest since Dec. 22. The
stock is up 8.3 percent this year, compared with a 1.1 percent
decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index.  “Investors’ expectation is that the bank will pay a
dividend for 2011,” Eugene Ezenwa, chief operating officer for
Lagos-based PAC Securities Ltd., said by phone today.  Nine-month net income rose 9.5 percent to 9.37 billion
naira ($61 million) from 8.55 billion naira a year earlier, Skye
Bank said on Oct. 17. Earnings are rising for Nigerian lenders
after the country implemented banking reforms following a debt
crisis in 2008 and 2009 triggered by loans given to stock market
speculators. The central bank introduced a December common year-
end for the country’s lenders, and results are expected to be
released from the end of this month.  The  Nigerian Stock Exchange  gives listed companies 90 days
after their year-end to release results.  “Any result that does not come out within two weeks may be
having a problem,” Ezenwa said.  A call to Skye’s head office in Lagos did not go through.  To contact the reporter on this story:
