Bekaert NV Chief Executive Officer
Bert De Graeve said he expects global production capacity for
sawing wire will surpass demand by more than three times.  Capacity utilization of plants making the material used to
slice silicon ingots into wafers for solar panels will drop to
about 31 percent next year from 38 percent last year, De Graeve
told reporters in Brussels today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
