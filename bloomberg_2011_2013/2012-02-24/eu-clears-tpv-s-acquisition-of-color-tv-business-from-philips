The European Commission said it
approved the proposed acquisition of the branded color-
television business of  Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA)  by TPV
Technology Ltd., a manufacturer of color TV sets and computer
monitors.  The commission, the European Union’s antitrust regulator in
Brussels, concluded that the transaction will not raise
competition concerns “due to the limited overlaps between the
parties’ activities and to the fact that sufficient alternative
sources of supply will continue to be available to the merged
entity’s customers in all markets concerned,” according to a
statement released today in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
