Ford Motor Co. (F)  opened its third
passenger-car factory in China today, increasing the automaker’s
manufacturing capacity in the country by a third to more than
600,000 vehicles annually.  The $490 million assembly plant, set up by the Dearborn,
Michigan-based company’s venture with  Changan Automobile Group
Co. (CFORDZ) , spans across 1 million square meters in the southwestern
Chinese city of Chongqing and will produce the new-generation
Focus sedans, Ford said in a statement today.  “This new flexible plant will help give us the capacity to
realize our aggressive growth plans for the world’s largest
automotive market,” David Schoch, chairman of Ford China, said
in the statement. The  production line  at the new factory will be
able to make six different vehicle types, the automaker said.  Expansion in the world’s largest vehicle market is part of
Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally ’s push to increase annual
global sales by 50 percent to 8 million vehicles by 2015 and
have one third of its deliveries in  Asia  by 2020. Ford plans to
bring 15 new models to China by 2015.  Vehicle sales growth in China slowed last year from 32
percent in 2010 after the government withdrew a two-year package
of tax breaks and rebates that helped the country overtake the
U.S. Total auto sales, including those of commercial vehicles,
grew 2.5 percent in 2011, according to the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers. The industry group forecasts
deliveries will probably accelerate to 8 percent this year.  Ford expects China’s vehicle market to expand 5 to 10
percent this year, Schoch said. The automaker will add 115
dealers this year, with at least 50 percent of them outside the
so-called Tier-1 cities, said Marin Burela, president of Ford’s
 China  venture. The company had 465 dealers in the country as of
the end of last year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
