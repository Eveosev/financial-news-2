Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  rose the most in
more than three months in Milan after forecasting a bigger-than-
expected reduction of debt as it cut its dividend payout.  The shares rose as much as 7 percent, the most since Nov.
11, and were up 5.7 percent to 85.85 cents at 10:26 a.m. in
Milan. The stock has risen 3.1 percent this year, boosting the
company’s market value to 15.7 billion euros ($21 billion).  Italy’s biggest phone company proposed dividends of about
900 million euros ($1.2 billion) for 2011, down from 1.2 billion
euros in 2010, “in light of the recent worsening of the
macroeconomic climate and the goal to maintain the  credit
rating ,” the Milan-based company said in a statement. The
company had previously forecast annual dividend growth of 15
percent through 2013.  “The dividend cut had already been digested by the
market,” Banca Akros analyst Andrea Devita, who has a “hold”
recommendation on the stock, wrote in a note today.  The company forecast stable earnings and revenue this year
and a “steady and persistent deleveraging to reduce the group’s
financial indebtedness,” it said in a separate statement. The
company forecast adjusted net debt will fall from 30.4 billion
euros in 2011 to 27.5 billion euros this year. That’s better
than an analyst average estimate for net debt of 29.7 billion
euros of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Organic revenue rose 2.7 percent last year, better than the
company’s own target of broadly stable sales. “The main driver
of the outperformance was  Brazil ,” Espirito Santo Investment
Bank wrote in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
