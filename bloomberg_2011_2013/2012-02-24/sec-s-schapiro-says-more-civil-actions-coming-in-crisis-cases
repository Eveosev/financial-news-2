The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission’s enforcement division isn’t finished pursuing cases
connected to the 2008 financial crisis, said SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro.  “There are more actions to come,” Schapiro said today at
a Washington securities-law conference, citing an enforcement
record that has filed actions against  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , and against executives
at  Bank of America Corp. ’s Countrywide unit, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac.  On another SEC effort, to institute a markets surveillance
system the regulator can use to monitor equities trading
activity, she said the “contours of the regulation are being
finalized.” She said it “should eventually be expanded to
include fixed income, futures and other markets.”  Schapiro also said the agency is close to finishing Dodd-
Frank Act mandates for the regulation of the security-based
swaps markets. She predicted the SEC will “soon finalize rules
that further define who will be covered by the new derivatives
regulatory regime and, next, what will constitute a security-
based swap.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
