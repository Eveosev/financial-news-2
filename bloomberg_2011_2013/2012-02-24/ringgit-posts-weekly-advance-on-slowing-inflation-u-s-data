Malaysia’s ringgit gained this week
after inflation slowed and better-than-expected U.S. economic
data bolstered demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency touched a two-week high today as the  MSCI
Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares advanced after data showed
applications for U.S. jobless benefits held at a four-year low,
while a rise in a Federal Housing Finance Agency index of
housing prices topped forecasts. Malaysian consumer prices rose
2.7 percent in January from a year earlier, the least in 12
months, according to a government report on Feb. 22.  “The U.S. numbers helped the market,” said Calbert Loh,
the Kuala Lumpur-based head of treasury at Bangkok Bank Bhd.
“The data has increased confidence about the prospects for
emerging markets.”  The ringgit added 0.7 percent this week to 3.0140 per
dollar as of 4:09 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It was steady today. The currency touched
3.0045 earlier, the strongest level since Feb. 9.  Five-year  government bonds  declined this week. The yield on
the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016 rose seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.22 percent, according to
Bursa Malaysia. The yield climbed two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
