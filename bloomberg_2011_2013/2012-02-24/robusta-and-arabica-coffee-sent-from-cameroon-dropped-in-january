Shipments of robusta from  Cameroon ,
central  Africa ’s biggest coffee grower, dropped 85 percent in
January, while arabica exports plummeted, according to a joint
report from the Cocoa and Coffee Board and the Cocoa and Coffee
Interprofessional Board.  Robusta-bean exports dropped to 252 metric tons from 1,708
tons a year earlier, the institutions said in an e-mailed report
from the port city of Douala today. Arabica exports fell to 60
kilograms (132.3 pounds) from 12 tons the year before, the
report said.  Exports for robusta came from three companies with  Olam
International Ltd. (OLAM) ’s Cameroonian unit shipping the most at 180
metric tons followed by Continaf BV unit GIC Proba with 54 tons.
The North West Cooperative Association Ltd. was the lone
exporter for arabica, the report showed.  Total exports for robusta reached 461 tons since the season
started in December while arabica shipments stand at 61 tons
since the crop harvest began in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
