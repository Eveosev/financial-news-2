Mauritius’s biggest trading partner.  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC)  , a Kenyan fuel retailer, rose 1.4
percent to 11.1 shillings. The company has become Kenya’s

to 25 percent last year from 18.3 percent a year earlier,
Business Daily reported.  Skye Bank Plc (SKYEBANK)  , a Nigerian lender, rose 4
percent to 4.16 naira, the highest since Dec. 22, as investors
bought the stock in anticipation that the bank will pay
dividends when it announces full-year 2011 results as soon as
next week.  “Investors’ expectation is that the bank will pay a
dividend for 2011,” Eugene Ezenwa, chief operating officer for
Lagos-based PAC Securities Ltd., said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
