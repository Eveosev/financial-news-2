Indian stocks had their first weekly
loss in eight on concern oil-price gains may fuel inflation and
prevent the  Reserve Bank  of India from easing monetary policy.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC)  tumbled the most in four
months after Citigroup Inc. sold its stake in the country’s
biggest mortgage provider.  State Bank of India , the largest
lender, slid 2.5 percent.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the biggest
engineering company, retreated for a sixth day.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, lost 1 percent to
17,906.36, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30 p.m.
in Mumbai. The measure lost 2.1 percent this week, ending a
seven-week rally. Oil futures gained for a seventh day today to
as high as $108.70 a barrel, the longest winning run since
January 2010, raising costs for companies in  India  that imports
three-quarter of its oil needs  “We don’t think the fundamentals have improved that much
on the ground in India and there’s still a lot of political
risks, and there’s this new factor of a surge in oil,”  Jonathan Garner , chief Asia and emerging-market strategist for Morgan
Stanley, said in a Bloomberg Television interview today. Morgan
Stanley is “very concerned” about India’s stock market,
because the nation is a major oil importer, he said.  The 30-company Sensex has advanced 16 percent this year as
overseas funds poured a net $5.5 billion into Indian equities
even as company profit growth slowed. Foreign  funds  bought a net
 $196 million  of shares Feb. 22, a 15th straight day of net
purchases and the longest since October 2010.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India slid 1 percent to 5,429.30. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  dropped 1
percent to 2,195.85.  To contact the reporters on this story:
