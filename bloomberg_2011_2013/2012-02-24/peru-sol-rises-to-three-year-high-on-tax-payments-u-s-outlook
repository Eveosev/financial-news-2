Peru ’s sol rose to a three-year high
as companies bought the currency to pay local taxes and as
reports bolstered confidence in the  U.S. economy , spurring
demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol climbed less than 0.1 percent to 2.6780 per  U.S.
dollar  at today’s close, from 2.6790 yesterday, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. That’s its strongest level since
at least December 2008.  Investor appetite for the currency grew as purchases of new
homes in the U.S. exceeded economists’ forecasts in January, and
a gauge of  consumer confidence  topped estimates. Finance
ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20
nations meet tomorrow in Mexico and may discuss committing fresh
cash to the  International Monetary Fund  to defuse Europe’s debt
crisis.  “In uncertain times such as now, Peru has performed very
well,” said  Mike Moran , a currency strategist at Standard
Chartered Bank in New York. “The risk-reward in the currency is
very good.”  The central bank bought $42 million in the spot currency
market today to slow the sol’s gains. It paid an average 2.6790
soles per dollar, the bank said in a statement on its website.  The gains may continue considering local banks’ net dollar
holdings remain “high” at about $300 million, BBVA Banco
Continental said in an e-mailed note to clients. Banks’ dollar
holdings have historically been about $150 million, it said.  Peru’s exports rose 21 percent to $3.59 billion in January
from a year earlier, as exports of commodities led by gold and
copper climbed 23 percent to $2.78 billion, industry group
Comexperu said in an e-mailed statement.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.52 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.11 centimo to 115.47 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
