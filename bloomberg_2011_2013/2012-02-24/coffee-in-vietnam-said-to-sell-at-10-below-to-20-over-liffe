Buyers of coffee from  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of the robusta variety, are starting to
see lower differentials for beans after futures rallied.  Beans for shipment next month range from a discount of $10
a metric ton to the price on NYSE Liffe to a premium of $20 a
ton, according to three traders with direct knowledge of the
sales. The beans were at a premium of $30 a ton last week.
Differentials correspond to a discount or premium to obtain
physical coffee in relation to the futures price.  Coffee futures climbed 3.5 percent yesterday as traders bet
Vietnam farmers would keep beans from the market. Roasters are
tapping European stockpiles with inventories in warehouses
monitored by NYSE Liffe falling since July. They dropped 7.1
percent in the past two weeks, the exchange said yesterday.  “Although the harvest for the Vietnamese crop year that
began Oct. 1 is complete, only 40 percent to 45 percent of it
had been sold as of mid-February,” German researcher F.O. Licht
GmbH, said in a report dated Feb. 22. “Farmers have been
holding back stocks in anticipation of higher prices.”  Bean sales may increase in the coming weeks as farmers will
need money for crop irrigation and fertilizers, Licht said.  Robusta for May delivery gained 0.4 percent to $2,025 a ton
by 10:56 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . Robusta beans are grown
in  Asia  and parts of  Africa  and used to make instant drinks and
espresso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
