Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) , a maker of chips
that help mobile devices connect to the Internet, said it’s
under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for its accounting practices.  The company received a request for documents from the Los
Angeles regional office of the SEC concerning its accounting for
litigation-related reserves, Broadcom said today in a  regulatory
filing . The investigation was probably prompted by allegations
from a former employee, Broadcom said.  “In response to these allegations, the company, with
oversight from the audit committee of the board of directors,
completed an internal review of these allegations with the
assistance of independent outside counsel and did not identify
any improprieties,” Broadcom said in the filing.  The company saw no need to revise its financial statements
following its investigation and will cooperate with the SEC’s
investigation, it said.  Litigation reserves were taken in the first quarter of 2011
related to intellectual-property claims, Broadcom said.  Broadcom, based in Irvine, California, fell as much as 4.2
percent in extended trading after the announcement. The shares,
up 25 percent this year, had closed at $36.75 earlier today.  Karen Kahn, a Broadcom spokeswoman, declined to comment
beyond the contents of the statement.  John Nester , a spokesman
for the SEC in  Washington , didn’t immediately respond to a
message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
