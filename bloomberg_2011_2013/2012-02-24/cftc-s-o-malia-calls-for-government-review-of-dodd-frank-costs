A Republican member of the U.S.
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission  is seeking an Office of
Management and Budget review of Dodd-Frank Act derivatives rules
that he says have gotten insufficient scrutiny from his agency.  Scott O’Malia , one of two Republicans on the five-member
CFTC, said the agency has failed to analyze alternatives to its
regulations and hasn’t justified its choices with specific cost-
benefit analysis. He made the comments in a letter to Jeffrey Zients, OMB’s acting director, dated yesterday.  O’Malia asked for a review of CFTC regulations, approved
yesterday by a 3-2 vote, for record-keeping and business conduct
standards for swap dealers and other large swap participants.  “The commission has failed to carefully and precisely
identify a clear baseline against which the commission measured
costs and benefits and the range of alternatives under
consideration,” said O’Malia, who voted against the rule.  The CFTC and  Securities and Exchange Commission  are leading
U.S. efforts to write derivatives regulations after largely
unregulated trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. Dodd-
Frank, the regulatory overhaul enacted in 2010, calls for most
swaps to be guaranteed by clearinghouses and traded on exchanges
or other platforms.  Steve Adamske , a CFTC spokesman, didn’t immediately respond
to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
