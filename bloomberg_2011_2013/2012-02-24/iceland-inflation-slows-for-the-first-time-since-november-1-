Iceland’s annual inflation rate
slowed for the first time since November, easing pressure on the
central bank to raise  interest rates .  Inflation slowed to 6.3 percent in February from 6.5
percent in the prior month, Reykjavik-based  Statistics Iceland 
said today in a statement on its website. Consumer prices rose 1
percent on the month, the office said.  Iceland’s central bank signaled on Feb. 8 it was ready to
raise interest rates in order to cap inflation. The  bank  this
month left its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.75 percent for a
second consecutive meeting, after last year raising borrowing
costs for the first time since Iceland’s banks failed in 2008.  Sedlabanki, which targets annual price growth of 2.5
percent, this month raised its forecast for economic growth in
2012 to 2.5 percent from 2.3 percent previously.  “Inflation appears to have peaked for the present, and we
expect it to continue falling in the near term,” Ingolfur Bender, head of research at Islandsbanki hf, said in a note to
clients before the release. The bank estimates inflation will
slow to 6 percent in March and “taper off steadily for the
remainder of the year,” he said.  The central bank expects inflation to slow to 4.6 percent
this year, 3.2 percent by the end of 2013 and 2.6 percent by the
end of 2014, it said in a Feb. 8 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
