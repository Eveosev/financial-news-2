U.S. farmland prices, already the
highest ever, may increase further as low  interest rates  and
surging agricultural income encourage farmers to invest in more
land to expand output, a Purdue University economist said.  Sales of land used for crops and ranches are being driven
mostly by demand from farmers, even as more financial investors
get into the booming market, according to Brent Gloy, a
professor at Purdue in  West Lafayette ,  Indiana . Higher interest
rates or lower agricultural prices would eventually constrain
growth, he said.  “Prices will go down someday, but probably not anytime
soon,” Gloy said today at a conference in Arlington, Virginia,
sponsored by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  The average  value  of farmland reached a record $2,350 an
acre in  2011 , the USDA said in August. Midwest prices measured
by the  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago  rose  22 percent  last
year, the biggest annual increase since 1976, while the Kansas
City Fed said cropland in its region rose 25 percent and
ranchland gained 14 percent, according to reports released
earlier this month.  Farmland in Iowa, the biggest U.S. producer of corn and
soybeans, surged 32 percent to a record average of $6,708 last
year, according to an Iowa State University survey of real-
estate transactions released in December. Gains in value during
the past two years largely have been supported by fundamental
growth in farm income, though bubbles may be forming in isolated
areas, the USDA said in a  report  earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
