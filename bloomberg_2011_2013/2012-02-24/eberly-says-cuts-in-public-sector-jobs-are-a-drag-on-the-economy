Janice Eberly, the U.S. Treasury
Department’s chief economist, said today cuts in jobs in the
public sector continue to be a drag on the economy.  “We are starting to see growth more in the private
sector,” Eberly, the Treasury’s assistant secretary for
economic policy, said at a conference hosted by Women in Housing
and Finance in  Washington . Job cuts, particularly in state and
local governments, are hampering employment growth, she said.
“Many of the public sector job cuts have been teachers,” she
said.  The warm winter has had a mixed impact on the economy, she
said. “The more general effect of the weather is it had a
negative effect on utilities. Eberly said. ‘‘It did seem to help
in the construction’’ industry.  ‘‘We are already seeing fiscal drag in the fourth-quarter
2011 gross domestic product data,’’ Eberly said. ‘‘The biggest
component of the increase was from the inventories. We should
absolutely be concerned about the path of fiscal policy going
forward.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
