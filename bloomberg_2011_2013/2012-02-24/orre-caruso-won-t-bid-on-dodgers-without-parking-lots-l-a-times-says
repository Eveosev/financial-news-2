Joe Torre  and real-estate developer
Rick Caruso won’t continue with their bid for the  Los Angeles
Dodgers  unless they can also purchase the stadium’s parking
lots,  the Los Angeles Times said .  Caruso, in a Feb. 17 letter to Major League Baseball
Executive Vice President Rob Manfred that was obtained by the
Times, said team owner  Frank McCourt  has made it clear that he
won’t sell the parking lots.  “Since the outset we felt that operationally it would be
impossible to effectively manage baseball operations having the
parking lots that surround the stadium under separate
ownership,” Caruso wrote in the letter.  Caruso said his group would reconsider its decision to
withhold a second-round bid if “the circumstances of the sale
change.”  Torre managed the Dodgers from 2008-2010 after leading the
 New York Yankees  from 1996-2007. He resigned as MLB’s executive
vice president for baseball operations last month to align with
Caruso.  The Dodgers have debts of about $570 million, the team said
in a statement filed with its plan of reorganization last month.  McCourt will name the winning bidder by April 1 with the
sale to be completed by April 30, the Times said. McCourt owes
his ex-wife, Jamie, a $131 million payment by May 1, the Times
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
