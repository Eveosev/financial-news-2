U.S. corn production may jump 15
percent to a record 14.27 billion bushels as surging profits
spur farmers to plant the most acres since World War II, the
government said. Soybean and wheat output also may climb.  Domestic corn inventories before this year’s harvest may
rise to 1.616 billion bushels, rebounding from a 16-year low in
the previous year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today
in a  report . Yields may average 164 bushels an acre from 94
million acres planted, the most since 1944. About 4.95 billion
bushels will be used to make  ethanol , the fewest in three years,
the USDA said.  “It appears more profitable to produce corn,” Ed Allen, a
USDA field-crops analyst, said in a presentation at the
department’s annual outlook forum, where the data was released.
“With normal weather, we expect a yield rebound. Since we have
a higher area, the supply response in the  United States  is
rather dramatic.”  Rising U.S. yields may boost soybean production to 3.25
billion bushels, up 6.3 percent from last year’s crop of 3.056
billion, the USDA said. Inventories before the harvest may still
tumble 25 percent to 205 million bushels, in part as exports
climb.  U.S.  wheat  output may rise to 2.165 billion bushels, up 8.3
percent from the 1.999 billion a year earlier, according to the
report. Exports may be unchanged at 975 million bushels, while
feed use jumps 24 percent to 180 million bushels. Stockpiles may
total 957 million bushels before the harvest, up 13 percent from
a year earlier, the USDA said.  The U.S. is the world’s largest grower of corn and
soybeans, and the biggest exporter of corn, soybeans and wheat.  To contact the reporters on this story:
