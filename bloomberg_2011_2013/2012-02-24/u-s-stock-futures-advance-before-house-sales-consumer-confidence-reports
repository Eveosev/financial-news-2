The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
advanced to the highest level since June 2008 amid better-than-
estimated consumer sentiment and home sales reports.  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , the largest seller of online customer-
management software, climbed 9 percent as billings growth beat
analysts’ forecasts.  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  added 1.5
percent after profit jumped  77 percent .  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  dropped at least 1.7 percent.  FedEx Corp. (FDX) 
retreated 1.9 percent, pacing losses in transportation shares,
as oil capped its longest increase since January 2010.  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to 1,365.74 at 4 p.m. New York
time, paring a gain of as much as 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average decreased 1.74 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,982.95, after rising above 13,000 earlier today.  “We like U.S. equities,” said James McDonald, chief
investment strategist at Northern Trust Corp. in Chicago. His
firm manages about $665 billion. “That’s a more defensive way
to participate in the global economic recovery. The stock market
is still attractive. Yet the Dow is flirting with 13,000. While
it makes no difference from a valuation standpoint, it can cause
some people to say: we’ve had a pretty a big run and I’ll take a
bit off the table.”  The S&P 500 gained as data showed that purchases of  new
homes  in the U.S. exceeded forecasts in January after climbing a
month earlier to a one-year high. The Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan final index of  consumer sentiment  for February rose
to 75.3. Economists projected a reading of 73.  Dow’s Attempts  Before today, the S&P 500 twice  this week  advanced above
its highest close since 2008, only to retreat by the end of the
day. The Dow traded near 13,000 during the week, failing to
close above that level. The 30-stock gauge hasn’t closed above
13,000 since  May 2008. (INDU)   Better-than-estimated economic and earnings data put the
S&P 500 on pace for a third month of gains, the  longest streak 
in a year. The index rose 4.1 percent in February. Earnings
topped analysts’ estimates at 68 percent of the 441 companies in
the index that released results since Jan. 9. The S&P 500 trades
at 14 times reported earnings, compared with the average since
1954 of 16.4 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Technology shares, which comprise 20 percent of the S&P
500, had the biggest gain among 10 industries.  Salesforce.com surged 9 percent to $143.64. The amount
Salesforce invoiced its customers grew 57 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, topping the 31 percent predicted by
 Brent Thill , an analyst at UBS AG in  San Francisco . Billings
rose 29 percent in the third quarter.  AIG Rallies  AIG gained 1.5 percent to $28.41. The insurer climbed after
citing a return to “sustainable operating profit” as it booked
a tax benefit that fueled  record  earnings. AIG now projects that
it will generate enough profit to use tax assets, tied to prior
losses, that can limit future payments to the government.  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  jumped 11 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $68.31. The shares surged 34 percent in three days. The
company yesterday announced plans to raise as much as $770
million by selling 11 store sites and separating some smaller-
format businesses.  Interpublic Group of Cos. rose 6.5 percent to $11.62. The
New York-based advertising company announced a $300 million
share  buyback  program.  A gauge of banks had the biggest decline in the S&P 500
among 24 industries, slumping 1.2 percent.  Regions Financial
Corp. (RF)  lost 1.9 percent to $5.80.  Bank of America  fell the most
in the Dow, dropping 1.8 percent to $7.88. Morgan Stanley
dropped 2.5 percent to $18.49.  Transportation Shares  The  Dow Jones Transportation Average (TRAN)  slid 0.4 percent,
reversing an earlier gain of 0.8 percent amid concern about
higher  oil prices . Crude for April delivery rose for a seventh
day to almost $110 a barrel. FedEx lost 1.9 percent to $90.24.  “Investors should make no mistake that while we’ve had
good trends in the marketplace and a decent reward coming for
stock investors, markets are going to remain volatile,”  Keith Wirtz , who oversees $14.6 billion as chief investment officer
for Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati, said in a
telephone interview. “Higher oil prices will act as a headwind
on this economy. I worry that we haven’t seen the peak yet.”  Gap Inc. (GPS)  retreated 4 percent to $22.57. The largest U.S.
apparel chain forecast  profit  this year that was less than some
analysts estimated as sales declined at its Old Navy stores.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  dropped 2 percent to $2.47.  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S. cable company, sued a unit of Sprint
alleging infringement of four telecommunications patents.  ‘Hope Phase’  Stocks are in the midst of a “hope phase” that may be as
short-lived as one that occurred a year earlier, according to
 Albert Edwards , a global strategist at Societe Generale SA.  He compares the S&P 500’s  performance  since October with
its year-ago swings. Last year, the index dropped during the
second half of February, rebounded to reach its 2011 high in
April, and tumbled in a second-half bout of volatility.  This year’s gains reflect anticipation of sustained U.S.
economic growth and a so-called soft landing for the Chinese
economy, according to Edwards, based in  London . He also cited
optimism that Greece’s second bailout and the  European Central
Bank ’s moves to ease bank financing will help the euro region.  “Hope still beats in the breast of equity investors,” he
wrote. “The market will rip out that hope and consume it in
front of investors’ eyes.”  Corporate earnings may be a catalyst for the abandonment of
hope, the report said. Edwards noted that estimates for  S&P 500 
companies as a group are dropping for the first time since late
2007, when the  U.S. economy  was sliding into a recession.  Edwards reiterated in September that the index will fall to
400, a plunge of about 70 percent from yesterday’s close, before
the next bull market begins. He saw the yield on 10-year
Treasury notes falling to 1.5 percent. Last year’s low was 1.67
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
