Citigroup Inc. (C)  received a subpoena
on Jan. 27 from the U.S. Department of Justice amid state and
federal investigations into the bank’s role in creating
mortgage-backed securities.  The bank has also received other subpoenas and requests for
information during the inquiries, the New York-based company
said in its annual regulatory filing today.  The  Justice Department  held a news conference that same day
in January, describing a new U.S. government unit that will
investigate misconduct in the bundling of loans into securities
that may have fueled 2008’s credit crisis. The department
subpoenaed 11 financial firms in the days beforehand, Attorney
General Eric Holder said at the time.   To contact the reporter on this story:
