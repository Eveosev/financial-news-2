Croatian lawmakers  approved the 2012
budget proposal, which includes 4 billion kuna ($700 million) in
proposed cuts to narrow the deficit and to bolster the country’s
credit ratings.  The cost-cutting should affect all branches of the public
sector as budget spending is cut to 118.8 billion kuna, from
last year’s 122.3 billion kuna. The measure is expected to
narrow the budget gap to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product,
from 5.5 percent in 2011.  “These are not popular reforms, but all the countries that
are doing better today have already executed them,” Prime
Minister  Zoran Milanovic  told lawmakers during the debate
earlier this week. “The bottom line is that we need to lower
expenditures without suffocating the economy, so that we can
concentrate on growth.”  Croatia , which is set to become the European Union’s 28th
member in 2013, is facing a review of its  credit rating  as it
needs to service a growing external debt and revive its
faltering economy. Milanovic last month said the economy will
grow 0.8 percent this year, while central bank Governor Zeljko Rohatinski said in December the country may slide into recession
again this year after a modest recovery in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
