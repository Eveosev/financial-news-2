OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, capped its first weekly advance this month as Hungary’s
retail sales beat estimates and speculation the global economy
is strengthening boosted demand for emerging-market assets.  The shares strengthened 3.3 percent to 4,040 forint by the
close in Budapest for a weekly gain of 2.4 percent. The
benchmark BUX stock  index  jumped 1.6 percent to 19,372.48.
 Foldhitel es Jelzalogbank Nyrt. , a Hungarian mortgage lender,
soared 6.9 percent to 543 forint.  Hungarian retail sales rose 1.5 percent in December from a
year earlier, exceeding economists’ expectations for 1 percent
growth. Purchases of new homes in the U.S. outstripped forecasts
in January after climbing a month earlier to a one-year high.
Better-than-estimated consumer confidence data also bolstered
confidence in the world’s largest economy.  “The retail sales growth implies that fourth-quarter
consumption figures might turn out to have been in positive
territory,”  Janos Samu , a Budapest-based economist at Concorde
Ertekpapir Zrt., wrote in a research report today on the
Hungarian data.  The forint depreciated 0.2 percent to 290.01 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
