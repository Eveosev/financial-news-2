Hammerson Plc (HMSO) , the third-largest
U.K. real estate investment trust, will sell its 624 million-
pound ($981 million) office portfolio and reinvest the proceeds
in shopping malls. Its shares rose the most in more than a
month.  The stock gained as much as 4.2 percent. Hammerson plans to
sell its 548 million pounds of existing office buildings, mostly
in  London , over the next three years, Chief Executive Officer
David Atkins said on a conference call. Hammerson will proceed
with office projects in progress, valued at 75.3 million pounds
at the end of last year, before selling them as well, he said.  “This specialization will benefit shareholders, providing
them with a credible 100 percent retail-focused alternative to
 Capital Shopping Centres  and enabling management to generate
superior returns,” Oriel Securities analyst Miranda Cockburn
said in a note to investors. She has an “add” recommendation
on the shares.  Offices represented 11 percent of Hammerson’s 5.72 billion
pounds of assets at the end of last year. Atkins announced the
shift in strategy as the London-based company reported a 2.2
percent decline in full-year profit excluding items. The company
has two office developments in London’s main financial district:
99 Bishopsgate and Principal Place.  Hammerson was up 2.4 percent at 395 pence at 9:07 a.m., the
biggest gain on the FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment Trust Index.
Hammerson advanced 9.6 percent in London trading in the three
months through yesterday, exceeding the 8.6 percent gain for the
11 members of the  FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment Trust Index. (F3REITS)   Earnings Slow  Earnings before changes in asset values and items fell to
137 million pounds, or 19.3 pence a share, as an end to a
 management contract  and a dozen job cuts lifted administrative
costs. Net asset value rose to 5.30 pounds a share from 5.20
pounds six months earlier.  “Our numbers today show that there are real positives out
there for retail,” he said on the conference call. The shift
plays to the company’s strengths of “prime assets and expert
management.”  Net rental income rose 4 percent to 296 million pounds.
Properties owned throughout the year increased net rental income
by 2.5 percent before acquisitions. Purchases, including six
malls and retail parks from  Kuwait ’s St. Martins Property
Investments Ltd., contributed 30.1 million pounds, the company
said.  Hammerson’s vacancy rate fell to 2.1 percent from 2.7
percent a year earlier as the company signed 355 leases at
higher rents.  Full-year  net income  fell to 335.7 million pounds from
615.4 million pounds a year earlier. Gains in the value of
Hammerson’s real estate added 186.3 million pounds to the total,
less than the previous year.  Hammerson will pay a second-half  dividend  of 9.3 pence a
share, up from 8.8 pence a year earlier. That took the total
payout for 2011 to 16.6 pence, up from 15.95 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
