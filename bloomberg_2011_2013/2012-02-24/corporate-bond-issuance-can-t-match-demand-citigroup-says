There aren’t enough corporate bonds
available to satisfy investor demand because the amount of
securities that have matured this year is outstripping new
issuance, according to analysts at  Citigroup Inc. (C)  in  London .  Maturities this year exceed sales of new investment-grade
bonds by 38 billion euros ($51 billion) compared with a positive
21 billion euros in the period a year ago, according to analysts
led by Hans Lorenzen in London. At the same time, an investor
survey Citigroup conducted show the highest level of inflows
into bond funds for two years, according to the report.  “The real story is that there simply isn’t enough paper
around to satisfy real money demand,” Lorenzen wrote in the
report today. “ Against such a skewed supply-demand balance it
will take a lot of bad news to prevent  spreads  from tightening
further.”  Investors looking for higher returns than on top-rated
 government bonds  have poured cash into the debt of non-financial
companies as the sovereign woes on  Europe ’s periphery threaten
the stability of the region’s financial system. That has pushed
up the cost of borrowing for financial companies, which has
caused their issuance year to date to fall to the lowest since
2009, according to Citigroup.  “An expanding pool of money seeking a shrinking investable
universe does suggest the market could be more resilient than
people give it credit for in their lack of fundamental
conviction,” according to the analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
