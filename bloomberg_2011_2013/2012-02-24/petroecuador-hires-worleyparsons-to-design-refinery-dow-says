PetroEcuador hired  Australia ’s
 WorleyParsons Ltd. (WOR)  to design a refinery, Dow Jones said, citing
the state-run oil company’s Chief Executive Officer Marco Calvopina.  The contract for the Refineria del Pacifico is worth about
$240 million, the news service said today, citing Ecuador’s
Minister of Non-Renewable Natural Resources Wilson Pastor. The
government is still seeking partners to fund construction of the
refinery, the newspaper said.  PetroEcuador couldn’t immediately confirm the story, said a
press officer, who asked not to be named because of internal
rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
