A  California real estate  investor
admitted that he conspired to rig bids at foreclosure auctions,
becoming the 10th person to plead guilty in a U.S. probe of the
practice, authorities said.  Wiley Chandler pleaded guilty in federal court in
 Sacramento , California, to conspiring with other real estate
investors to rig bids at real estate  foreclosure  auctions in San
Joaquin County, according to a statement today by the U.S.
Justice Department and federal prosecutors in Sacramento.  “After the conspirators’ designated bidder bought a
property at a public auction, they would hold a second, private
auction, at which each participating conspirator would bid the
amount above the public auction price,” according to the
statement. “The conspirator who bid the highest amount at the
end of the private auction won the property.”  The difference between the price at the public auction and
that at the second auction was the group’s profit, according to
the statement.  Chandler pleaded guilty to bid rigging, which carries a
maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. A defense attorney,
Claudia Quiroz, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment
on the plea.  Nine others have pleaded guilty in a scheme that ran from
September 2008 to at least October 2009, prosecutors said.  The case is U.S. v. Chandler, 11-cr-00511, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of  California  (Sacramento).  To contact the reporter on this story:
