France ’s ambassador to  Syria , Eric Chevallier, returned to his Damascus office yesterday, two weeks
after he left the country, the French Foreign Ministry said.  Chevallier will “work hard” to secure the evacuation of
French journalist Edith Bouvier, whose leg was broken in an
attack in the city of Homs this week that killed the Sunday
Times’s Marie Colvin and photographer Remi Ochlik, ministry
spokesman Bernard Valero said in an e-mailed statement today.  Bouvier pleaded in a video yesterday for a cease-fire so
she can be evacuated and receive appropriate medical care.  To contact the reporter on this story:
