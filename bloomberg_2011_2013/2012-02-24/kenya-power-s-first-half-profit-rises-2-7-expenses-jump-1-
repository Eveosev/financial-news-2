Kenya Power Ltd., (KPLL)  the East African
nation’s sole electricity distributor, said first-half profit
rose 2.7 percent as surging operating costs offset an increase
in revenue.  Net income grew to 2.28 billion shillings ($28 million) in
the six months through December, the Nairobi-based company said
in a statement e-mailed by the city’s stock exchange today.
Revenue climbed 51 percent to 47.1 billion shillings, while
operating expenditure increased 56 percent to 43.5 billion
shillings, it said.  Revenue is “in line with our projections,” Suki Muia, a
research analyst at Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a
phone interview today. “Operating costs will remain high in
financial year 2012 in line with overall business growth,” she
said, with expenses coming from staff costs and depreciation.  In fiscal 2011, demand for electricity is expected to grow
by 7.9 percent, rising to 13 percent by 2015, Muia said.  Kenya Power’s shares gained for a fourth day, rising 2.7
percent to 17 shillings by the close in Nairobi. The earnings
were released after th end of the trading session. Kestrel
Capital has a target price of 22 shillings on the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
