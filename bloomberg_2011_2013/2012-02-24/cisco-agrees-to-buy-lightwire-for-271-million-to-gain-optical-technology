Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the world’s
largest networking-equipment maker, agreed to buy Lightwire Inc.
for $271 million to add optical connectivity technology used in
high-speed networks.  Cisco will pay the sum in cash and retention-based
incentives, according to a statement from the company today. The
purchase of the Allentown, Pennsylvania-based company will
probably be completed in the fiscal third quarter, Cisco said.  Closely held Lightwire’s technology would help Cisco’s
customers to meet growing demand for video, data and so-called
cloud services. Chief Executive Officer  John Chambers  has
eliminated jobs and exited businesses in a bid to reverse the
slide that knocked 11 percent off  San Jose , California-based
Cisco’s share price last year.  Cisco rose 0.2 percent to $20.28 in early trading at 8:39
a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
