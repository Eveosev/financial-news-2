Black Earth Farming Ltd. (BEFSDB) , a
Stockholm-listed Russian grain producer, said its net loss
increased about 15 percent to $41.7 million last year from $36.4
million a year earlier because of bad crop quality.  The company sold 399,473 metric tons of grain last year, up
from 208,667 tons a year earlier, while earning less because the
low-quality crop was sold cheaper, at an average price of $157 a
ton, down from $162 a ton, it said in a preliminary annual
report published today.  The crop’s yield was damaged by a dry spell in the summer
and its quality was further affected by excessive wet weather in
the autumn of 2011, the company said.  Black Earth Farming’s winter wheat, which is planted over
82,000 hectares (202,000 acres), is in good condition so far
because it was protected with “decent snow cover” from frosts
in January and February, it said. The grain producer plans to
sow an area of about 230,000 hectares for the 2012 crop,
according to company data.  To mitigate risk, Black Earth Farming has sold about 60,000
tons of 2012 crop forward, mostly malting barley, as well as
some sunflower and rape seeds.  The company, based in St. Helier,  Jersey , farms fields in
the so-called Black Earth regions of Kursk, Tambov, Lipetsk and
Voronezh in southwestern  Russia . The company’s land bank
includes 260,000 hectares in full ownership with other 28,000
hectares in process of ownership registration and 40,000
hectares in a long-term lease, according to company data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
