Belarus will reduce its  refinancing
rate , the highest in the world, for the second time this year in
a bid to stem speculative inflows of capital that can boost
volatility.  The former Soviet republic will cut its rate by 5
percentage points to 38 percent on March 1, the Natsionalnyi
Bank Respubliki Belarus said in an e-mailed statement today. The
regulator began lowering the benchmark refinancing rate this
month for the first time in 17 months after President Aleksandr Lukashenko said the economy can’t tolerate the impact of high
borrowing costs in the credit market.  Reducing the refinancing rate will help rein in the
profitability of Belarusian ruble financial instruments,
stemming the inflow of speculative short-term investments from
abroad, the regulator said.  “The role of the refinancing rate will be constantly
increasing compared to other monetary instruments,”
Natsionalnyi Bank Respubliki Belarus said, pledging to maintain
a flexible rate policy as needed to fight inflation and ensure
stability in the money markets.  Belarus began lowering its benchmark refinancing rate to 43
percent on Feb. 15 after 12 increases since September 2010 from
10.5 percent to 45 percent, according to  statistics  on the
central bank’s website. The regulator plans to gradually reduce
the rate to 20 percent to 23 percent this year, Deputy Chairman
Sergei Dubkov said on Feb. 16 at a conference in the capital,
Minsk.  To contact the reporters on this story:
