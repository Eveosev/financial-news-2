President  Barack Obama  said European
governments have made progress in resolving the sovereign debt
crisis even as there’s more work to do.  Obama spoke at the White House following his meeting with
Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, 45, who last October
became Denmark’s first female prime minister.  Thorning-Schmidt said she is confident “we will see
ourselves through” the debt crisis.  With Denmark holding the European Union presidency for the
first half of this year, the White House said in a statement
ahead of the meeting that  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis would
be a topic on the agenda. The leaders also discussed the turmoil
in Syria.  Obama said it’s “absolutely imperative for the
international community to rally,” to send a clear message to
President Bashar al-Assad that it’s time “to stop the killing
of Syrian citizens by their own government.”  Obama also thanked  Denmark  for its contributions to the
coalition in Afghanistan and to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization mission in Libya.  To contact the reporters on this story:
