India ’s benchmark bonds completed a
weekly drop on concern an increase in  oil prices  will spur
faster inflation.  Yields rose to a two-week high as the  finance ministry  sold
120 billion rupees ($2.4 billion) of notes due in 2020, 2024 and
2030 today. Oil prices for April delivery advanced for a seventh
day and touched $108.74 a barrel yesterday in  New York , the
highest level since May 5. That may prompt refiners to boost
fuel costs, according to Krishnamurthy Harihar, treasurer at
FirstRand Ltd.  “Oil prices have risen fast and that may bring back
inflation worries,” Mumbai-based Harihar said. “Persistent
debt supplies are also damping demand for  government bonds .”  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due November 2021 rose
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this week to 8.23
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate advanced three basis points today.  The wholesale-price index increased 6.55 percent in
January, the least in 26 months, compared with 7.47 percent in
December, according to official data. The rate held above 9
percent in the previous 12 months.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
rose nine basis points this week to 8.17 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate climbed one basis point
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
