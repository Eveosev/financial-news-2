Fiat SpA (F)  will export more than 90
percent of its Serbian car production through the port of Bar in
Montenegro under an agreement with shipper Grimaldi Group and a
local cargo specialist, the transport ministry said.  After the start of serial production in the second quarter
of its new model, a  larger version  of the redesigned 500
subcompact, some 90,000 units will be shipped through  Luka Bar (LUBA) 
in the first year, with a gradual increase to 200,000 vehicles
in three years, Montenegro’s transportation ministry said in an
e-mailed statement.  The  port  will also handle imports of car parts from  Italy 
for the Fiat plant in Serbia, the ministry said after the accord
was signed in Bar yesterday between Fiat’s shipper Grimaldi
Group,  Montecargo AD (MORG) , the local provider of rail cargo services
and  Luka Bar .  Fiat’s facility in  Serbia  is a joint venture with the
Serbian government, created when the Italian carmaker took over
the now defunct Zastava Automobili in Kragujevac, central
Serbia, to become a 67 percent owner of Fiat Automobili Srbija.  To contact the reporter on this story:
