Mitsubishi UFJ Lease & Finance Co. (8593) 
is marketing its second sale of yuan-denominated bonds in Hong
Kong, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The company, 20 percent owned by trading company Mitsubishi
Corp., plans to sell 300 million yuan ($47.6 million) of three-
year notes, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the details are private. The Reg S bonds will price to
yield 3.75 percent to 4 percent, the person said.  Tsutomu Yamanishi, a spokesperson for the company in  Tokyo ,
declined to confirm the bond sale when contacted today.  BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley are
managing the sale, which may price as soon as today, the person
said.  The Japanese company raised 200 million yuan from a 1.65
percent Dim Sum note it sold in March. That bond matures in
April 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
