Russian gross domestic product
expanded 3.9 percent in January from a year earlier as the  trade
surplus  grew, Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  said.  The trade surplus widened to $21 billion last month,
Nabiullina told reporters today in Moscow, in comments confirmed
by the ministryâ€™s press service.  Seasonally adjusted GDP declined 0.1 percent in January
compared with December after slower retail sales and investment,
she said.  The economy grew 3.8 percent in December from a year
earlier and was unchanged in seasonally adjusted monthly terms,
the ministry said on its website Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
