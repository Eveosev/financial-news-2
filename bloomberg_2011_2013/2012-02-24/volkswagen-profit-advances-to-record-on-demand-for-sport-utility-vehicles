Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest
automaker, reported record 2011 profit as demand increased for
Audi and VW sport-utility vehicles.  Earnings before interest and taxes advanced 58 percent to
11.3 billion euros ($15.1 billion), the Wolfsburg, Germany-based
carmaker said in a statement today. Profit matched the 11.3
billion-euro average  estimate  of 22 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue gained 26 percent to 159 billion euros.  Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  is adding
factories in a bid to surpass  General Motors Co. (GM)  as the world’s
biggest carmaker. VW, which delivered a record 8.27 million
vehicles in 2011, aims for sales growth this year outpacing the
market’s expansion. The German company has expanded production
of SUVs such as the VW Tiguan and Audi Q5 to meet high demand in
the U.S. and  China , its largest market.  “There’s not a real positive surprise, so there might be
some disappointment,” said  Juergen Pieper , a Frankfurt-based
analyst with Bankhaus Metzler. “The quality of the earnings is
probably better, but more explanation is needed.”  The stock  rose  10 cents, or 0.1 percent, to 139.25 euros in
Frankfurt trading today. The shares have gained 20 percent this
year, valuing the carmaker at 61 billion euros.  Higher Dividend  Volkswagen raised the  dividend  for 2011 by 35 percent to
3.06 euros per preferred share from 2.26 euros a year earlier.
The dividend per common share for last year will be 3 euros. The
carmaker will release more details on 2011 earnings on March 12.  Future growth may also come from pending mergers. VW is
exploring options to combine with majority shareholder  Porsche
SE (PAH3)  after scrapping plans last year for a merger because of legal
tangles.  To avoid further delays, VW may drop the full merger and
instead buy Porsche’s carmaking business, two people with direct
knowledge of the situation said in November. VW already owns
49.9 percent of  Porsche (PAH3) ’s automaking business and holds an
option to purchase the remaining 50.1 percent.  Volkswagen (VOW3) ’s 2011 net income was lifted by a gain from the
revaluation of the Porsche options. The figure more than doubled
to 15.4 billion euros from 7.23 billion euros.  VW last year took a majority stake in German truckmaker  MAN
SE (MAN) , raising its holding to 55.9 percent. VW has been seeking
closer links between MAN and Soedertaelje, Sweden-based  Scania
AB (SCVB) , which it also controls, with a goal of forging a three-way
truckmaking alliance. Such a tie-up may save as much as 1
billion euros in annual costs, VW has said.  Liquidity Drop  VW’s net liquidity in 2011 dropped 8.6 percent to 17
billion euros because of 7 billion euros in spending on equity
investments, including the increase in the MAN stake.  “VW generated a negative  cash flow  in the fourth
quarter,” Michael Punzet, a DZ Bank analyst who recommends
buying the shares, said in a note to investors. “In our view,
this is mainly related to production cuts at year end and some
investments at plants” for a new underbody that will be used as
the basis for several vehicles.  Investments in property, plants and equipment in 2011 rose
40 percent to 7.93 billion euros, VW said today.  The maker of the Golf hatchback, VW’s best-selling vehicle,
plans to spend a record 62.4 billion euros over the next five
years on plants, models, research and development to underpin
its global expansion. VW wants to hire more than 50,000 workers
through 2018 as it targets more than 10 million autos per year.  Daimler AG (DAI)  this month forecast that operating profit this
year will be “in the magnitude” of 2011’s 8.98 billion euros.
CEO  Dieter Zetsche  has vowed to retake the luxury-car lead from
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  after slipping last year to third
behind Audi. Daimler predicts industrywide auto deliveries will
rise 4 percent globally this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
