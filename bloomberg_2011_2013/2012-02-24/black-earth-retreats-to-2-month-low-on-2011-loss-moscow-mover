Black Earth Farming Ltd. (BEFSDB) , a
Stockholm-listed Russian grain producer, dropped to the lowest
price in almost two months after reporting its net loss widened
last year because of bad crop quality.  The shares slid 3.5 percent to 14 kronor as of 5:28 p.m. in
 Stockholm , the lowest intraday price since Jan. 2.  The companyâ€™s net loss widened about 15 percent to $41.7
million in 2011 from $36.4 million a year earlier, according to
its annual report, published today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
