Hammerson Plc (HMSO) , Britain’s third-
largest real estate investment trust, plans to sell its office
portfolio and reinvest the proceeds in shopping malls.  The London-based company today reported that full full-year
profit excluding items declined 2.2 percent as administrative
costs increased. Hammerson said it will divest its office assets
over the “medium term.”  Earnings before changes in asset values and items fell to
137 million pounds ($216 million), or 19.3 pence a share, from
140.2 million pounds, or 19.9 pence, a year earlier, company
said today in a statement. Net asset value rose to 5.30 pounds a
share from 5.20 pounds six months earlier.  Analysts expected earnings of 19.6 pence a share, the
 average  19 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Chief Executive
Officer David Atkins sold 555 million pounds of real estate in
2010 to help pay debt and fund acquisitions and projects.
Hammerson raised 272 million pounds last year, mainly from the
sale of a  London  office building and a stake in a mall near
Paris.  Hammerson advanced 9.6 percent in London trading in the
three months through yesterday, exceeding the 8.6 percent gain
for the 11 members of the  FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment Trust
Index. (F3REITS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
