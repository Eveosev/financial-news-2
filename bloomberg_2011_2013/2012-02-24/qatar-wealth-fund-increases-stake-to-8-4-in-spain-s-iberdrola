Qatar Investment Authority, the
emirate’s sovereign wealth fund, increased its stake to 8.4
percent in Iberdrola SA, raising its investment in  Spain ’s
largest electricity provider to 2.27 billion euros ($3 billion).  The fund based in Doha has surpassed all other stockholders
except for Spanish construction company Actividades de
Construccion & Servicios SA, which holds about 19 percent of
Iberdrola, according to the utility’s annual corporate
governance report covering 2011 activities released yesterday.  The  Qatari fund  bought its initial 6.2 percent holding in
March and acquired the additional shares in a year Iberdrola
fell 16 percent. That was its worst market performance since
2008, as the global economic slowdown damped demand for power
and Spain slipped toward a second recession in four years.  Iberdrola, which yesterday said it may miss a 2012 profit
target, fell 1.8 percent to 4.45 euros as of 2:44 p.m. in
 Madrid. (IBE)  That compared with a 0.3 percent gain in the 20-member
benchmark Euro Stoxx Utilities Index.  The Spanish power company, also the world’s biggest owner
of wind farms, trades at 8.9 times estimated earnings, cheaper
than the 9.7 times ratio of the benchmark index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  A spokesman for the sovereign wealth fund in Doha wasn´t
available for comment.
