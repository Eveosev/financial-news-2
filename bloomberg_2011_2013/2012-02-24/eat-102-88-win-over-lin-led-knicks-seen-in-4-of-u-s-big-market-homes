The showdown between the All-Star-
stacked Miami Heat and Jeremy Lin’s New York Knicks was seen in
four percent of households in the top 56 U.S. television
markets, according to Turner Sports.  The  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  company didn’t immediately have
figures to compare how the preliminary ratings for last night’s
game on TNT network fared against its other NBA broadcasts this
season. National ratings will be released later today.  Television ratings and ticket prices have soared to watch
the Knicks play since Lin, the first Harvard University graduate
to play in the NBA since Ed Smith in 1953-54 and the first
Taiwanese- or Chinese-American ever to play in the league,
started his first game on Feb. 6. He had been mostly a bench-
warmer since joining the league last season, twice being cut by
NBA teams before shining with 25 points and seven assists in a
New York win over the  New Jersey Nets  on Feb. 4.  Lin entered last night’s game averaging 23.8 points, 9.4
assists and 3.8 rebounds in 10 games as a starter. He was held
to eight points on 1-of-11 shooting, turning the ball over eight
times in the 102-88 loss to Miami. All-Stars  Chris Bosh ,  Dwyane Wade  and  LeBron James  scored 25, 22 and 20 points respectively
for Miami, which won its eighth straight game.  The Heat’s 27-7 record is tied with the Oklahoma City
Thunder for the best in the NBA. The Knicks fell to 17-18 with
the loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
