Didier Cuche won his fourth World
Cup ski race of the season by taking today’s Super-G in his
native  Switzerland .  Cuche finished in a time of 1 minute, 33.11 seconds in
Crans-Montana to beat Canada’s Jan Hudec by 0.16 seconds.
Austrian Benjamin Raich was third.  The win pulls Cuche to within 38 points of leader Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, who finished seventh today, in the
Super-G standings. Cuche also has three downhill victories this
season to top the standings in that discipline.  Austria’s Marcel Hirscher finished 34th to maintain his
lead in the overall World Cup standings ahead of Croatia’s  Ivica Kostelic .  To contact the reporter on this story:
