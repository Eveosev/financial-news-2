Spending by the Republic of Congo’s
road fund will more than triple this year to 66.5 billion CFA
francs ($136 million), according to Nzenguet Elenga-Obat, the
fund’s director-general.  The road fund will focus on rehabilitating roads in the
Central African country’s major cities, including the capital,
Brazzaville, and the Atlantic coast oil hub Pointe-Noire,
Elenga-Obat told reporters in Brazzaville today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
