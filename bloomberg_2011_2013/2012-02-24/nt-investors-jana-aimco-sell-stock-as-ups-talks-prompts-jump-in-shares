Two of the largest investors in  TNT
Express NV (TNTE) , the Dutch express-delivery service in takeover talks
with  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , reduced their stakes after the
shares surged.  Jana Partners LLC and Alberta Investment Management Corp.,
or AIMco, lowered their holdings to less than a 5 percent
regulatory threshold, according to Feb. 22 filings with Dutch
financial markets regulator AFM.  Barry Rosenstein ’s Jana Partners, which cut its stake to
4.49 percent from a 7.15 percent holding reported on May 31,
said last month that TNT’s operating performance was “poor”
and requested the delivery company name supervisory board
members it proposed. The stake managed by AIMco was reduced to
4.59 percent from 7.52 percent, according to the filings.  “We choose not to react because we never comment on buy
and sell activities of individual shareholders,” Ernst Moeksis,
a spokesman for Hoofddorp, Netherlands-based TNT, said by
telephone today.  PostNL NV (PNL) , the main Dutch postal service and
owner of 29.9 percent of TNT shares, declined to comment,
spokesman Werner van Bastelaar said today.  TNT Express, which was spun off from PostNL in May, is in
talks with UPS after rejecting a 4.89 billion-euro ($6.5
billion) offer on Feb. 11 from the Atlanta-based company.  TNT  declined  as much as 1.9 percent to 9.32 euros and
traded down 1.2 percent at 9:23 a.m. in Amsterdam. The stock has
gained 48 percent since TNT’s announcement on Feb. 17 that it’s
the talks with UPS and as analysts and investors said  Memphis ,
Tennessee-based competitor  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  may submit a counter-bid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
