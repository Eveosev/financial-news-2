Pittsburgh Pirates President Frank Coonelly apologized after being arrested for driving under the
influence of alcohol in suburban Pittsburgh, describing his
actions as “irresponsible and wrong.”  Coonelly, 51, was arrested Dec. 22 and charged with one
count each of drunken driving, driving the wrong way, careless
driving and driving with a blood-alcohol level at least twice
the state’s legal limit of .08 by police in Ross Township,
 Pennsylvania , the  Associated Press  reported.  “There is no excuse for ever driving under the influence
of alcohol,” Coonelly said in a statement released yesterday
after a meeting with owner Bob Nutting at the team’s training
complex. “My conduct that night was uncharacteristic to my
personally held values.”  Nutting said Coonelly “clearly understands the seriousness
of his poor decisions, the harm that could have been inflicted
on others and the embarrassment his mistakes have caused the
organization.”  Coonelly joined the Pirates on Sept. 13, 2007, from  Major
League Baseball  where he was senior vice president and general
counsel.  He will be arraigned March 20 in Allegheny County Common
Pleas Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
