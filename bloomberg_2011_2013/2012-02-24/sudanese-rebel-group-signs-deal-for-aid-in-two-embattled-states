A Sudanese rebel group said it
signed an agreement with the government to allow aid into rebel-
controlled areas in two border states where the U.S. says half a
million people may face famine conditions.  The accord, signed on Feb. 18 with the  United Nations , the
 African Union  and the Arab League, will allow humanitarian
assistance to flow into the Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile
states, said Arnu Ngutulu Lodi, spokesman for the Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement-North. The implementation of the agreement
has yet to be discussed, he said.  “Time is running out and people are suffering so it needs
to happen as soon as possible,” Lodi said by phone today from
Nairobi, the capital of neighboring Kenya. “We are not confident
of Khartoum honoring this agreement, because we know Khartoum
signs agreements and does not honour them.”  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations  Susan Rice  said on
Jan. 17 that Sudan’s government has “deliberately denied access”
to international aid and UN workers in the two states. The next
day U.S. special envoy to Sudan Princeton Lyman said about
500,000 people in Southern Kordofan and  Blue Nile  may face
“emergency conditions bordering on famine” by March.  Fighting in the states has intensified since  South Sudan 
seceded on July 9 and took control of three-quarters of the
former state’s oil output of 490,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
