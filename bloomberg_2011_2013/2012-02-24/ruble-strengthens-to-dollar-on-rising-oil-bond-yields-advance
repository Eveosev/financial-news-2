The ruble strengthened against the
dollar, poised for its biggest weekly gain in four as signs of
economic recovery in the U.S. drove demand for oil,  Russia ’s
chief export earner.  The Russian currency appreciated 1 percent to 29.3878 per
dollar as of 11:39 a.m. in Moscow, its strongest intraday level
since Sept. 6. A close at that level would mean a weekly gain of
1.8 percent, its eighth consecutive advance and the biggest
since Jan. 29. The ruble was little changed at 39.3025 per euro
and climbed 0.4 percent to 33.85 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  Oil jumped 0.7 percent to $108.53 a barrel in New York
crude futures trading after a report showed U.S. jobless claims
held at the fewest since March 2008, signalling stronger demand
in the world’s largest consumer of the commodity. A report today
may show  Germany ’s gross domestic product grew 1.5 percent last
quarter, an eighth period of expansion.  “The overall sentiment is bullish, and it was a holiday in
Russia while the euro climbed above $1.33” yesterday, Yury Karpinsky, a currency trader at  Renaissance Capital  in Moscow,
said by e-mail. “We followed  market sentiment . All Eastern
European currencies appreciated following the euro.”  Russia’s exchanges were closed for the Defenders of the
Fatherland holiday yesterday.  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. The central bank may be
buying $150 million to $250 million in foreign currencies to
slow the ruble’s advance after it passed through 33.87 against
the basket today, Nikolay Podguzov, head of fixed-income
strategy at VTB Capital in Moscow, said by e-mail.  Eurobonds Fall  RenCap’s Karpinsky said Bank Rossii will step up foreign-
currency purchases to about $250 million a day once the ruble
appreciates beyond 33.70 against the basket.  Russia’s $2 billion of Eurobonds due 2015 fell for a second
day, pushing the yield up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 2.633 percent. Dollar bonds due in 2015 from OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, yielded five basis points
less than yesterday at 3.958 percent, while the yield on
similar-maturity notes issued by state gas monopoly OAO Gazprom
dropped seven basis points to 3.881 percent.  Investors pared bets the ruble will weaken, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the Russian currency at 29.7588 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 29.9385
per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
