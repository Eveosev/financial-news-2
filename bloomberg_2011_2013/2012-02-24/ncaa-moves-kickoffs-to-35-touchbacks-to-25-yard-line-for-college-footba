College football will move kickoffs
up five yards to the 35-yard line and bring touchbacks out to
the 25-yard line instead of the 20 beginning next season in an
effort to reduce injuries, the sports’ governing body said.  The  National Collegiate Athletic Association’s  Football
Rules Committee recommended the changes this month after data
showed that injuries occurred more during kickoffs than at other
times of games. The plan is designed to encourage touchbacks
with the ball downed in the end zone.  The new rule, which was passed Feb. 21 by the NCAA’s
Playing Rules Oversight Panel, parallels changes the  National
Football League  made before the 2011 season. The professional
league moved kickoffs to the 35, but didn’t change touchbacks.  Other rules changes that will take effect next season:  If a player loses his helmet on a play other than when
fouled, he must sit out the next play. NCAA data showed that
players lost their helmets about twice a game last season.  Offensive players between the tackles when the ball is
snapped and who are not in motion are allowed to block below the
waist legally and without restriction. The change was made to
clarify an existing rule, the NCAA said.  Players can no longer leap over the offensive line on punts
to get into the backfield, because players often land on their
heads or shoulders, risking injury. The receiving team can’t
jump over blockers, unless the player goes straight up or
between two players.  To contact the reporter on this story:
