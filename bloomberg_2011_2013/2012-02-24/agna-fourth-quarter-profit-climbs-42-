Magna International Inc. (MGA) , North
America’s largest auto-parts supplier, said fourth-quarter
profit jumped 42 percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as car
and light-truck production increased in the region.  Net income rose to $312 million, or $1.32 a share, from
$219 million, or 89 cents, a year earlier, the Aurora, Ontario-
based company said today in a statement. Sales gained 13 percent
to $7.25 billion, boosting revenue for all of 2011 to $28.7
billion. Magna forecast sales of $28 billion to $29.5 billion
this year.  North American vehicle production increased 10 percent to
13.1 million vehicles in 2011, including a fourth-quarter rise
of 15 percent to 3.44 million, Magna said. U.S. sales of cars
and light trucks gained 10 percent last year to 12.8 million,
according to  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based Autodata Corp.  “Industry production and sales data through the quarter
continued to show growth in  North America  and Europe,” Steve Arthur, an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in Toronto, said in a
Feb. 16 note to clients. He rates Magna shares “outperform.”  Magna today also raised its  dividend  to 27.5 cents a share
from 25 cents, the first increase since February 2011.  Excluding one-time items, Magna reported profit of $1.46 a
share. That exceeded the $1.02 average of 17  analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  European ‘Disappointment’  Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes rose 28 percent
in the quarter to $321 million, buoyed by a 22 percent increase
in profit at the company’s  North American unit . On that basis,
Magna’s European unit posted a loss of $3 million, compared with
profit of $20 million a year earlier.  “ Europe  was a disappointment in 2011,” Chief Executive
Officer Don Walker told analysts on a conference call. Still,
fourth-quarter results showed an improvement from the previous
three months, “and we expect further improvement through
2012,” he said.  Magna expects the auto-parts industry to continue to
consolidate in the long term as carmakers expand globally,
Walker said.  The company is “looking at a number of different things,
no more or less than we have traditionally been looking at, but
there are a lot of opportunities out there,” Walker said. “I
suspect we will continue to make some acquisitions.”  He didn’t elaborate.  Magna fell 1.1 percent to C$44.95 at the close in Toronto
today. The  shares  have risen 32 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
