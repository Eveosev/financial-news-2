Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI) , operator of
the Red Lobster,  Olive Garden  and LongHorn Steakhouse chains,
said  beef  costs may climb 12 percent during the fiscal year that
starts May 28.  The meat will be the “primary driver of increased costs,”
 Orlando , Florida-based Darden said today in a slideshow
 presentation  for an analyst meeting. Seafood costs may drop 3
percent, while chicken rises 2 percent, the company said.
Seafood accounts for 31 percent of Darden’s food costs, followed
by beef at 14 percent and chicken at 5 percent.  While dairy prices will be stable, wheat, flour and pasta
costs may decline 2 percent, and produce expenses will increase
1 percent, the restaurant chain said. Costs for all commodities
and energy will be flat, Darden said.  Food and beverage inflation is forecast at 0.5 percent to
1.5 percent, according to the presentation. That’s down from an
estimated 6.1 percent increase in the current fiscal year, which
ends May 27, Darden said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
