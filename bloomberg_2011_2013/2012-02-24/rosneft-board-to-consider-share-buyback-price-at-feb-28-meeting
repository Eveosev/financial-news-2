OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , Russia’s largest oil
producer, will consider the price of a share buyback at a Feb.
28 meeting, it said in a regulatory filing today without
providing further information. The shares gained.  Rosneft rose as much as 6.7 percent in  London  trading, the
most since Nov. 28. The shares were up 5 percent at $7.80 at
3:40 p.m. local time.  “I would be making sales in the stock at these elevated
levels,” said Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF
Global Trading in London. The buyback story is at odds with
fundamentals, as the company has large debt, and spending plans
are likely to eliminate free  cash flow  this year, he said.  Rosneft’s press service declined to comment on a possible
buyback when phoned by Bloomberg.  Russian news service RIA Novosti, in a report on the board
meeting, referred to an earlier offer of 157 rubles a share made
to minority shareholders that voted against a 2009 crude-for-
loans deal with  China  that also involved OAO Transneft, Russia’s
oil pipeline operator.  The state-run company’s board of directors will also
consider deals exceeding $500 million in value, Rosneft said in
the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
