The Czech Finance Ministry will
propose freezing spending worth 23.6 billion koruna ($1.3
billion) in 2012 to meet the budget-deficit target, the  CTK 
newswire reported, citing a ministry document.  Budget expenditures, compared with the initial projection,
may have to be cut by 42.4 billion koruna next year, CTK said,
quoting a document that the governmentâ€™s economic ministers are
scheduled to discuss next week.  Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek said Jan. 31 that
spending cuts may total as much as 26 billion koruna this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
