European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said history has shown that it can
take years for a country to win back an AAA rating.  “If we just look at this in practice, one can see that an
AAA rating can be lost quickly, but that it can take a very long
time to regain it,” Nowotny, who also heads the Austrian
central bank, told reporters in Vienna today.  Austria and  France  lost their AAA rating at  Standard &
Poor’s  on Jan. 13, as the rating company also downgraded seven
other euro nations, citing the European debt crisis. The two
countries’ top grade may also be cut at Moody’s Investors
Service, according to a Feb. 13 statement.  “Look at what happen when Sweden was going through a
financial crisis,” Nowotny said. “It took five to six years
till they got back their AAA rating.”  Nowotny, who has repeatedly criticized the “political
role” rating companies have been assuming, declined to comment
on whether Austria would also lose its AAA rating at Moody’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
