Tajikistan, which gets most of its
oil from  Russia , is also willing to purchase crude from  Iran ,
 Press TV  reported, citing Dolat Ali Hatamov, the central Asian
country’s ambassador to Tehran.  Hatamov, who spoke yesterday, didn’t give any details,
according to the Iranian state-run news channel’s website.  The Iranian government said this week it halted direct
sales of crude to French and British buyers and forbade re-sale
of its oil to these two nations, which have been harsh critics
of its nuclear program.  The move was aimed at pre-empting a European Union embargo
of Iranian oil set to take effect in July. Iran will give its
crude to “new customers,” Alireza Nikzad Rahbar, an Oil
Ministry spokesman, said on Feb. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
