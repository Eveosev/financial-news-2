French jobless claims jumped in
January as concern about stalling economic growth prompted
companies such as Alcaltel-Lucent and  Peugeot Citroen SA (UG)  to trim
payrolls.  The number of people actively looking for work at the end
of January rose by 13,400 to 2,861,700, the Labor Ministry said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest total since
October 1999. The ministry revised its series for last year,
leaving claims at 2,848,300 at the end of December.  French growth slowed to 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
defying forecasts that the country would tip into a recession as
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and other European leaders struggled
to end Europe’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
