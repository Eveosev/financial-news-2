PT Bumi Resources (BUMI) ,  Indonesia  ‘s
biggest coal producer, plans to increase sales to Japan by 17
percent this year, according to an official at the company.  Shipments may rise to 14 million metric tons in 2012,
compared with an estimated 12 million in 2011,  Dileep Srivastava ,
a Jakarta-based director at  Bumi  said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  Japan has increased thermal electricity generation to
replace lost atomic power since the Fukushima nuclear accident
in March 2011. The nation’s imports of power-station coal will
probably rise 3 percent to 104 million tons in 2012, Daiwa
Capital Markets said last month.  “In 2012, our sense is that we should hit 2010 levels if
not exceed it,” said Srivastava, who estimated that prices to
Japanese customers will be from $110 to $120 a ton. Bumi sold
12.7 million tons of coal to  Japan  in 2010, accounting for 21
percent of its total exports, according to its annual report.  The company is in talks with Japanese buyers for supply
contracts in the fiscal year ending March 2013 and expects to
finalize the agreements early in the second quarter of this year,
Srivastava said in an interview on Feb. 21.  Biggest Coal Consumer  It has agreed on prices for about 15 million to 16 million
tons of coal for this year, he said. The company has committed
to contracts for 35 million tons for which the price is either
not fixed or is linked to the price of coal at  Newcastle (CLSPAUNE) ,
 Australia . It plans to sell a total of 75 million tons this year,
he said.  China , the world’s biggest coal consumer, surpassed Japan
as the largest importer of the commodity for both power
generation and steelmaking in 2011. China’s purchases rose 10
percent to 183.2 million tons last year, according to data
released by the General Administration of Customs. Japan
imported about 175.2 million tons from overseas in 2011,
according to data from the Ministry of Finance.  Bumi dropped 3 percent to close at 2,425 rupiah in Jakarta
trading today. The stock has risen 10 percent this year,
compared with a 2.2 percent gain for the benchmark Jakarta
Composite index.  Mine-Mouth Power Plant  Bumi and partners including local company  DH Energy  won a
bid to build a mine-mouth power plant with capacity to generate
600 megawatts of electricity at the site of its  PT Pendopo 
Energi Batubara unit in South Sumatra, Srivastava said.  The group plans to build the power station, estimated to
cost $1 billion, and sign a power-purchase agreement with state
electricity company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara in this quarter,
he said. Bumi owns 85 percent share in PT Pendopo Energi, which
has potential coal resource of 1.9 billion tons, according to
the company in its  website.  DH Energi owns the rest.  Binarto Bekti Mahardjana, Listrik Negara’s head division of
electric power transaction and business, wasn’t available to
comment when contacted by phone. A call to Listrik Negara’s
Construction Director Nasri Sebayang wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
