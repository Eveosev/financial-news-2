The European Commission is
“following closely” a probe of the audit market by U.K.
antitrust authorities, while having no evidence that the
industry has breached EU competition law, the EU’s antitrust
chief said.  “The top-end of the audit market is highly concentrated,
with ‘the Big Four’ audit firms being the main suppliers,” EU
Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said in a written
response to a parliamentary question published on the EU’s
website today. The market for “services to small and medium-
sized enterprises is less concentrated however, with mid-tier
and smaller audit firms competing effectively with the Big
Four,” he said in the response, which is dated Feb. 16.  “Currently, the commission is not investigating the
concentration in the audit market,” Almunia said. “For the
moment, there is no evidence pointing to possible EU competition
law infringements.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
