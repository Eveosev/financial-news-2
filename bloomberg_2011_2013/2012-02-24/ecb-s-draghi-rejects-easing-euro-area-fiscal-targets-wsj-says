European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  rejects easing fiscal targets for countries in the
euro area, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an
interview.  Backtracking on fiscal targets would elicit “an immediate
reaction by the market,” Draghi told the newspaper, adding that
that would have the effect of “pushing interest-rate spreads
higher.”  His comments were made as the Financial Times reported that
advisers to Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  are asking the
European Commission to ease the national budget deficit target
after revised EU forecasts that Spain’s economy will contract
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
