U.S. dairy farmers will see a 27
percent drop in net-cash income on average this year as feed
costs rise and milk prices decline, said Milton Madison, a U.S.
Department of Agriculture economist.  Dairy income will fall to $175,500 per farm from a record
$239,800 a year earlier, Madison, senior economist for the
agencyâ€™s Dairy and Sweeteners Analysis Group, said today at a
conference in Arlington, Virginia. Lower corn and hay prices in
the second half of 2012 will bring some relief, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
