What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade after the U.S. government
said increased production later this year will double reserves
before the start of the harvest in 2013,  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis ,
said in a telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  forecast
that a larger domestic crop and rising world supplies will boost
stockpiles before the 2013 harvest to the highest in three
years, Schultz said.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT after the USDA said rising global demand will erode
U.S. reserves before the 2013 harvest to the smallest in three
years, Schultz said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.1 cent a pound lower to 0.1 cent higher, and soybean-meal
futures may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
