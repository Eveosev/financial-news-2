(Corrects import and demand numbers in story first
published yesterday.)  China  may import 2.9 million metric
tons of sugar in 2011-2012, up from 1.9 million tons in 2010-
2011, according to INTL FCStone Inc. Demand may be 13.8 million
tons in 2011-2012, compared with 13.6 million tons in 2010-2011,
Mario Silveira, senior risk manager, said at a conference in
 Singapore  today. China may be a bullish influence as a record-
low stockpiles-to-use ratio helps drive higher imports even as
supply increases, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
