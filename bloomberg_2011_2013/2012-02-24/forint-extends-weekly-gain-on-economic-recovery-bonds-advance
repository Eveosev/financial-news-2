The forint extended its weekly gain
and Hungarian bonds advanced as retail sales beat estimates and
speculation the global economy is strengthening boosted demand
for emerging-market assets.  Hungary’s currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 288.42 per
euro by 12:26 p.m. in Budapest, extending the appreciation this
week to 0.5 percent. The government’s benchmark 10-year bonds
climbed, cutting yields nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 8.738 percent.  Retail sales  rose 1.5 percent in December compared with a
year earlier, exceeding economists’ expectations for 1 percent
growth. U.S. home sales probably climbed to a nine-month high,
economists said before a Commerce Department report today, a day
after data showed jobless claims held at a four-year low.  “The retail sales growth implies that fourth-quarter
consumption figures might turn out to have been in positive
territory,”  Janos Samu , a Budapest-based economist at Concorde
Ertekpapir Zrt., wrote in a research report today on the
Hungarian data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
