Home prices  in Cyprus dropped in the
third quarter last year for the seventh consecutive quarter amid
an oversupply in housing and economic slowdown, the  Central Bank
of Cyprus  said.  Home prices slid 5.5 percent in the third quarter from a
year earlier, including a 6.7 percent decline in apartment
prices and a 4.9 percent drop in  house prices .  The slump in home prices was concentrated in coastal areas,
the bank said in a  statement  on its website today.  -- Editors: James Kraus, Tim Farrand  To contact the reporter on this story:
