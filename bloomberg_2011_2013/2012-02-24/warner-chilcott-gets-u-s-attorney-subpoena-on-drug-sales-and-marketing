Warner Chilcott Plc (WCRX)  and some non-
executive employees received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s
Office in  Massachusetts  for information on a “wide range of
matters,” including its sales and marketing practices.  The Feb. 22 subpoena seeks information on payments to
people who are in a position to recommend drugs, medical
education, clinical trials, off-label use and employee training
for key products, the Dublin-based company said today in a
 filing  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  “We intend to cooperate in responding to the subpoena but
cannot predict or determine the impact of this inquiry on our
future financial condition or results of operations,” Warner
Chilcott said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
