Seven states sued the U.S. seeking
to block a government mandate requiring religious organizations
to offer  birth control  for their employees, on grounds the
requirement violates the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment.  The lawsuit, filed today in federal court in Nebraska by
the state’s attorney General Jon Bruning, claims the requirement
violates free exercise of religion and freedom of speech rights.
The case, brought on behalf of Catholic schools, organizations,
and individuals, was joined by Florida, Michigan, Ohio,
Oklahoma,  South Carolina  and Texas.  The regulation “would coerce religious organizations,
institutions, care providers, outreach groups, and social
service agencies, among others to directly subsidize” different
forms of contraception against their religious beliefs,
according to the complaint.  The mandate is part of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into
law in 2010. This month, Obama offered a compromise that would
force health insurers, and not religious-affiliated charities,
to pay for contraceptives for employees of those institutions.
Republican lawmakers have vowed to push for a measure in
Congress to repeal the policy.  Erin Shields, a spokeswoman for the  U.S. Department of
Health  and Human Services, declined to comment on pending
litigation.  The case is Nebraska v. U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 12-CV-03035, U.S. District Court for the District of
Nebraska.  To contact the reporter on this story:
