Spanish  producer-price inflation 
slowed for a fourth month in January as the economy edged toward
its second recession since 2009.  Prices (SPROYOY)  of goods leaving factories, mines and refineries
rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier, after increasing 5.2
percent in December, the  National Statistics Institute  in Madrid
said today. Economists had expected a gain of 4.3 percent,
according to the median of three forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey. Prices fell 0.8 percent on the month.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , in power since December, is
trying to convince investors and voters he can face down
opposition to overhaul the economy and implement the deepest
budget cuts in at least three decades.  Spainâ€™s economy  may
shrink more in the first quarter than in the last three months
of 2011, when it declined 0.3 percent, Deputy Economy Minister
Fernando Jimenez Latorre said on Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
