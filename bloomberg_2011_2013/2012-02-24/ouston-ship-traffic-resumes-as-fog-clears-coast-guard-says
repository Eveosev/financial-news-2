Houston Ship Channel pilots were
resuming operations at 6:30 a.m. this morning to clear a backlog
of 93 deep-draft vessels that developed when fog hampered
visibility, the U.S. Coast Guard said.  Fog overnight, which capped several days of intermittently
foggy weather, left 53 ships in port waiting to leave and 40
waiting offshore to enter the largest U.S. petroleum port,
Michael Stevenson, a Coast Guard watch supervisor, said in a
telephone interview today. Pilots had last suspended operations
at 10 p.m. local time yesterday, he said.  Pilots will begin guiding outbound ships first, to clear
dock space for arriving vessels, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
