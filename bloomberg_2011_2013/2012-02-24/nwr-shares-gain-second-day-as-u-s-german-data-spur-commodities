New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the largest
Czech coking-coal company, gained a second day as signs of
economic recovery in the U.S. and  Germany  drove demand for
commodities.  The stock rose as much as 1.6 percent and last traded 0.3
percent higher at 154 koruna at the end of trading in Prague.
The shares added 2.3 percent yesterday.  U.S. jobless claims held at the fewest since March 2008,
while South Korean  consumer confidence  increased to the highest
level in three months and Germanyâ€™s gross domestic product grew
1.5 percent from a year ago for an eighth quarter of expansion.  Coal prices may also rebound from the second quarter,
according to He Wei, an analyst at Bocom International Holdings
Co. Consumption volumes are forecast to rise 8.3 percent this
year amid a recovery in industrial activity, the analyst wrote
in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
