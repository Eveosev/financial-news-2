Orascom Telecom Holding SAE dropped
the most in more than six months in  Egypt  after billionaire
 Mikhail Fridman  withdrew an offer to buy a 16 percent stake in
the mobile phone company.  The shares  of Cairo-based Orascom Telecom fell 5.6 percent,
the most since Nov. 25 , to 4.7 Egyptian pounds (67 cents) a the
close. The drop made them the biggest decliner on the EGX 30
Index, which retreated 1.2 percent. Orascom Telecom shares
jumped 7.8 percent last week compared with a gain of 1.8 percent
for the benchmark.  Baskindale Ltd., a unit of Fridman’s Altimo Holdings &
Investments Ltd., had asked for permission to buy the stake
after its initial 70 cents per-share offer failed to attract 26
percent of holders, the minimum it set to execute the deal.
Orascom Telecom holders who had accepted Altimo’s offer got
permission to take back their stock, according to a statement to
Egypt’s bourse.  “Now that investors who tendered their shares have access
to them some may be taking profits,” said Wafik Dawood,
director of institutional sales at Cairo-based Mega Investments
Securities. Baskindale’s withdrawal is “positive from a
valuation perspective,” he said.  Orascom Telecom shares were valued at 86 cents a share by
its adviser on the deal, HC Securities & Investments. About 7.3
million shares traded, or almost two times the three-month daily
average.  Altimo is the biggest shareholder in  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , which
owns 52 percent of Orascom Telecom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
