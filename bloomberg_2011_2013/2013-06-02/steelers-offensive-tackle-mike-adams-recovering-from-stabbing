Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle
 Mike Adams  is recovering from stab wounds received when three
men tried to rob him, the National Football League team said.  The 23-year-old Adams was confronted about 3 a.m. yesterday
by assailants who wanted his truck that was parked on
Pittsburgh’s South Side, the  Associated Press  said, citing
police.  When Adams told them he didn’t have his keys, one pointed a
gun at his face and a second man stabbed him in the abdomen and
forearm before all three ran, police said, according to the AP.
The injured Adams ran to a nearby restaurant for assistance.  “I had an angel lookin out for me!” Adams wrote and
posted on Twitter after surgery on his abdomen and left forearm.
“I’ll be ok just gotta fight to get back harder then ever.”  Adams was drafted in the second round of the 2012  NFL Draft 
and was the winner of the Joe Greene Great Performance Award,
given to the outstanding Steelers rookie. He started six of the
10 games in which he played in 2012.  “We are aware of the situation regarding Mike Adams being
stabbed earlier this morning,” Steelers General Manager Kevin Colbert said on the team’s website. “We are in direct
communication with both Mike and his family. Mike is expected to
make a full recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
