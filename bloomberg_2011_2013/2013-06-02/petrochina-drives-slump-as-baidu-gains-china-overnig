PetroChina Co. (PTR) , the nation’s biggest
oil producer, led a monthly slump in state-owned companies
traded in  New York .  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  rallied the most in 19 months on
prospects the government will seek to boost the economy by
supporting private businesses.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. sank 2.6 percent on May 31, a day
before the government released manufacturing data for China that
exceeded economists’ estimates. The measure slumped 3.6 percent
in May to 89.73, the biggest monthly loss since February.  PetroChina lost 9.5 percent in its fifth monthly decline,
while  China Eastern Airlines Corp. (CEA)  tumbled 18 percent for the
steepest slump since 2011. Huaneng Power International Inc.,
China’s largest electricity producer, lost the most in 14 months
in May. Baidu gained 13 percent and  E-Commerce China Dangdang
Inc. (DANG)  surged 67 percent in its best month on record.  China’s government included boosting private investment as
one of the reform steps outlined in a May 24 statement, after
data showed state enterprises have seen their return on equity
fall to 5.9 percent last year, from 10.2 percent in 2010. The
China-US gauge has lost 9.5 percent this year, compared with a
14 percent rally in the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5 percent last week and
has rebounded 5.8 percent from this year’s low on May 2. The
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index climbed to 50.8 from 50.6 in April,
the National Bureau of Statistics and  China  Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said in Beijing on June 1. That was
higher than all estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of 30
analysts and compares with the median projection of 50, which
marks the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  Favoring Consumption  The PMI report may provide some comfort to policy makers
after the preliminary reading of a private manufacturing survey
pointed to the first contraction in seven months.  “Chinese policy makers are signaling they’ll sacrifice the
short-term expansion rate and focus on driving longer-term
growth by boosting consumption,” Di Zhou, a Santa Fe, New
Mexico-based equity analyst at Thornburg Investment Management,
said by phone May 31. “In line with the policy, commodities
stocks are no longer favored by investors while they prefer
consumer, service-related companies to benefit from the huge
potential of consumption from China’s big population.”  State-owned companies also drove a decline in the  Hang Seng
Index (HSI)  for stocks traded in  Hong Kong  last month, led by a 19
percent decline in electricity generator China Resources Power
Holdings Co., and a 15 percent loss in China Coal Energy Co.,
the country’ second-biggest coal producer. Tencent Holdings
Ltd., the biggest  Internet company  by market value in China, and
computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. were the best performers on the
gauge.  PetroChina Drops  Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang  said last week the nation seeks
7 percent annual growth this decade during his visit to Germany,
down from more than 10 percent in the previous 10 years. He
pledged in a May 13 speech an expanded role for market forces in
the economy and touted developing medium-sized and small
businesses and the  service industries .  PetroChina’s American depositary receipts fell to $115.68
in New York, the lowest level since December 2011. China
Petroleum Chemical Corp., the nation’s second-largest energy
company, known as Sinopec, sank 7.9 percent in May to $101.81,
the most in a year.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore oil
explorer, lost 7.2 percent to $173.84.  Oil futures declined 1.6 percent in May on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , a second monthly slide.  Airlines Slump  China Eastern , the nation’s second-biggest carrier, based
in Shanghai, slumped 18 percent last month to $16.75, falling
the most since September 2011. Its bigger rival China Southern
Airlines Co. retreated 15 percent in May to a six-month low of
$22.76.  Air passenger volume in China rose 9.2 percent in April
from a year earlier, the slowest growth in three months, data
from the National Statistics Bureau showed May 30.  E-Commerce, the biggest online book retailer in China known
as Dangdang, surged 67 percent last month to $6.42 in New York.
Its ADRs have advanced 55 percent this year after sinking 5.7
percent in 2012 and 84 percent in 2011.  The net loss at the Beijing-based company narrowed to $11.7
million in the first quarter, according to a statement May 16.
Six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted an average loss
of $15.6 million. Dangdang forecast second-quarter sales to be
about $260 million, higher than the $239.1 million estimated by
analysts.  Baidu, owner of the most-used web search engine in China,
climbed 13 percent in May to $96.64, rising the most since
October 2011.  Small Companies  The company, also based in Beijing, bought PPS Net TV’s
Internet video business for $370 million on May 7 to combine
with its iQiyi.com platform, as it seeks an initial public
offering of the video business.  “Over the long term, smaller entrepreneurial businesses
are likely to do better anyhow because they are the most focused
on profitability and less on the need of the state,”  Kevin
Carter , a co-founder of AlphaShares LLC, the index creator and
fund manager that invests in Chinese stocks, said by phone May
31 from Walnut Creek, California.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., slid 4.6 percent last month in
New York to $36.01, while the  S&P 500  climbed 2.1 percent in its
seventh monthly advance. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
in Hong Kong dropped 2.9 percent to a five-week low of
10,599.21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
