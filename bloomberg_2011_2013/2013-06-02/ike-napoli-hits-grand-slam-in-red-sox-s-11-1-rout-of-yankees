Mike Napoli  hit his second grand slam
of the season to propel the Boston  Red Sox  to their 11-1 rout of
the  New York  Yankees last night in a Major League Baseball game.  Napoli’s grand slam at Yankee Stadium followed an
intentional walk to  David Ortiz  to load the bases. Napoli has
batted four times this season after Ortiz was walked, hitting
two home runs and driving in eight runs.  “My job is to be his protection,” Napoli said. “I like
protecting him and maybe giving managers another thought.”  Daniel Nava blasted a three-run homer in the eighth inning
and Stephen Drew hit a home run in the ninth for the Red Sox.
Napoli and Daniel Nava each drove in four runs for Boston.  Boston (34-23) leads the American League East, two games
ahead of the Yankees (31-24), who have lost five of their last
six games.  Felix Doubront (4-2) allowed one run on six hits and struck
out six in six innings, while Junichi Tazawa, Craig Breslow and
Koji Uehara each pitched a perfect inning.  Yankee pitchers  Phil Hughes , Preston Claiborne and Adam
Warren allowed 18 hits, the most in a game since June 29, 2012,
against Chicago when the White Sox recorded 19 hits.  Hughes (2-4) allowed five runs on seven hits and struck out
seven in 4 1/3 innings, while Warren gave up six runs on eight
hits in three innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
