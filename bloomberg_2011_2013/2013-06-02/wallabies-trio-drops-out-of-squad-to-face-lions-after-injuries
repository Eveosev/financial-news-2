Australia rugby coach Robbie Deans
made three injury-forced changes to the Wallabies’ preliminary
squad for the Test series against the British and Irish Lions
starting this month.  Scrum-half Nick Phipps, lock Kane Douglas and loose forward
Ben McCalman were added to the 25-man roster in place of winger
Digby Ioane, second-rower Sitaleki Timani and flanker Scott
Higginbotham, the Australian Rugby Union said.  Higginbotham and Timani got injured playing for their Super
Rugby teams this weekend and their prospects of being fit to
face the Lions will be determined after they have scans for
respective shoulder and thumb injuries, the ARU said in an e-mailed statement.  Ioane last week underwent a knee operation and will be
unable to train for some of the preparation time in the lead-up
to the June 22 series opener against the Lions in Brisbane.
He’ll stay with the squad to continue his rehabilitation.  The squad enters training camp today and another six
players will be added to a final 31-man roster to be announced
June 11. Deans said Phipps’s selection doesn’t rule ACT Brumbies
scrum-half Nic White out of contention for one of the final six
berths.  REVISED WALLABIES 25-MAN SQUAD: Ben Alexander, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Berrick Barnes, Nick Cummins, Dave Dennis, Kane Douglas,
Saia Fainga’a, Israel Folau, Will Genia, Liam Gill, Michael
Hooper, Rob Horne,  James Horwill , Sekope Kepu, Christian
Leali’ifano, Ben McCalman, Stephen Moore, Ben Mowen, James
O’Connor, Wycliff Palu, Nick Phipps, Benn Robinson, Rob Simmons,
James Slipper, Joe Tomane.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
