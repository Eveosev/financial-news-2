South Korea’s government aims to sell
 Woori Finance Holdings Co. (053000) ’s main banking unit by the end of
2014 after it failed three times to offload its 57 percent stake
in the country’s biggest financial group by assets.  “We will try to designate a new owner of Woori Bank” by
the end of next year, Financial Services Commission Chairman
Shin Je Yoon told reporters on June 1, according to pool reports
e-mailed from the state agency yesterday. Authorities are open
to an option to sell  Woori Finance ’s units “in pieces,” he
said.  The government is reviving plans to sell its 5.5 trillion
won ($4.9 billion) stake in Woori Finance after it received no
bidders for its stake in the company last year in the third sale
attempt since 2010. The Public Fund Oversight Committee, which
oversees sales of state assets, is studying all possible options
to sell Woori Finance and will announce details by the end of
this month, Shin said.  Woori Finance was created in 2001 as a holding company for
lenders rescued by the government following the Asian financial
crisis in 1997-1998, as part of a push to make the banking
industry more competitive. The holding company contains Woori
Bank, Kwangju Bank, Kyongnam Bank, and Woori Credit Card,
according to  Bloomberg data .  BS Financial Group Inc. (138930) , whose units include Busan Bank, is
interested in acquiring Woori Finance’s Kyongnam Bank unit, Moon
Kyung Ho, general manager of BS Financial’s strategy planning
division, said in an interview with Bloomberg News in May.  The government may sell provincial banks owned by Woori
Finance to the bidders who offer “the highest price,” Shin
said.  Shares of Woori Finance fell 2.1 percent to 11,950 won on
May 31, paring their gains for the year to 1.3 percent. That
still exceeds the 0.2 percent advance in the benchmark Kospi
index in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
