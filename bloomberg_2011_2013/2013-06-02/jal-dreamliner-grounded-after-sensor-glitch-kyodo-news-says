A problem with an air-pressure sensor
on a battery container in a  Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  787 Dreamliner
made by  Boeing (BA)  Co. caused the airline to use another plane for a
Tokyo-to-Beijing flight,  according  to  Kyodo News .  Japan Airlines said the sensor showed a difference in air
pressure between the outside and inside of the container during
a safety check before the departure of Flight 21 from  Tokyo â€™s
Haneda airport, the news network reported.  Yesterday, Japan Airlines and  ANA Holdings Inc. (9202)  restarted
Dreamliner flights. The twin-engine jetliner, the first built
chiefly of composite materials, was grounded for more than four
months because of battery malfunctions.  Susan Bradley, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Boeing, said
that the company was aware of the issue and was working on it
with the airline. She referred inquiries to Japan Airlines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
