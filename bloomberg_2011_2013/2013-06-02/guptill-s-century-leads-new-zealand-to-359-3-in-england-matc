Martin Guptill made the highest total
by a  New Zealand  batsman in one-day cricket as his team
beat England by 86 runs to take a 2-0 lead and clinch the three-game series.  Guptill, who scored 103 not out in the opening match, hit
an unbeaten 189 in his team’s 359-3 at Southampton. England
ended all out for 273 after 44.1 overs. Jonathan Trott, who’d
dropped Guptill when he was on 13, scored a century.  “It’s an extremely proud moment, credit to Martin in these
two games and also  Ross Taylor , he’s been outstanding with the
bat,” New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum said. “Clean
hitting is what Martin does and he did it again today.”  Guptill, named man of the match, batted for all of New
Zealand’s 50 overs today after the visitors won the toss. Last
week, New Zealand won the first match, at Lord’s in London, by
five wickets.  Taylor scored 60 today, Kane Williamson made 55 and
McCullum was 40 not out.  James Anderson  led England’s attack,
taking 2-65.  England captain  Alastair Cook  and fellow opener  Ian Bell 
were dismissed for 34 and 25, respectively, as the hosts reached
64-2. Joe Root was out for 28 and Eoin Morgan went for 21.  ‘Huge Credit’  The rest of England’s batting order went cheaply apart from
Anderson, with 28 off 19 balls, and Trott, who finished on 109
not out. Mitchell McClenaghan took 3-35.  “Huge credit to New Zealand,” Cook said. “They really
batted us out of the game. We bowled pretty well until the 42nd,
43rd over but New Zealand built a huge platform and kept wickets
in hand. When you’ve got a guy on 100 not out and Brendon
McCullum, it’s very hard to stop them.”  The final one-day international is at Nottingham on June 5.
New Zealand lost the two-match Test series against England 2-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
