(Corrects title in first paragraph.)  The head of the Cyrenaica National
Council in the eastern region of Libya declared the area semi-autonomous, a sign of growing territorial tensions in the
country more than two years after  Muammar Qaddafi  was killed in
an uprising.  Ahmed Al Zubeir As-Senussi, the council’s head, announced
in a June 1 ceremony that the eastern Libyan region would be
self-governed and have its own legislature, the state-owned  news
agency , LANA, reported.  There was no official reaction from the country’s central
government in Tripoli. Thousands of people rallied in March 2012
in Tripoli and Benghazi, the second-largest city, in support of
a unified Libya after some regional leaders had called for more
autonomy.  Cyrenaica, called Barqa in Arabic, will be governed in
accordance with the 1951 constitution, LANA cited As-Senussi as
saying. As-Senussi wants to revive the federal system used under
the late King Idris I who ruled over the regions of Cyrenaica,
Tripolitania and Fezzan before unifying them in 1963. King Idris
was overthrown by Qaddafi in 1969.  Libya  holds the largest proven oil reserves in  Africa  and
close to 80 percent of its reserves are located in the east.  To contact the reporter on this story:
