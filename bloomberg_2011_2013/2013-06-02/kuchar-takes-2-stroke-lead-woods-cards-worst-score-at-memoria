Matt Kuchar  shot a 2-under 70 to take
a two-stroke lead into the final round of the  PGA Tour ’s
Memorial Tournament, while  Tiger Woods  tries to rebound from his
worst nine holes as a professional.  Kuchar ended 54 holes at 8-under 208 yesterday at Muirfield
Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio.  “I played some steady golf. I got the wind figured out as
best as possible and I’m driving it well,” Kuchar said in a
televised interview. “You can play some moderately aggressive
golf out there.”  World No. 1 Woods carded a 9-over 44 on the back nine, his
highest nine-hole score on the PGA Tour, to end the day 7-over
and sharing 69th place at 8-over 224.  “The conditions were tough and when I missed, it cost
me,” said Woods, whose previous worst nine-hole score was 43.
“I caught the wrong gusts at the wrong time, made a couple bad
swings and all in all it just went the wrong way.”  Kevin Chappell hit a 4-under 68 to share second place with
Kyle Stanley, who had a 1-over 73, two strokes off the lead.  Second-round leader  Bill Haas  carded a 4-over 76 to tie for
fourth place at 5-under 211 with Matt Jones and  Justin Rose .  Strong storms were forecast for nightfall, prompting
tournament officials to delay the start of today’s final round
until 10:40 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
