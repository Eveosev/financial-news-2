Total SA (FP)  Chief Executive Officer
Christophe de Margerie said refineries could close in  Europe 
including France amid a decline in demand for fuel.  “We don’t need so much capacity in France,” de Margerie
said yesterday in a television interview on LCI. “We have to
know how to choose” among refineries.  European crude processors have reduced output after slower
economic growth curbed fuel demand. Petroplus Holdings AG, once
Europe’s largest independent processor, filed for insolvency and
is in the process of shutting a refinery in France at Petit-Couronne. Total lowered European capacity by 23 percent to 1.8
million barrels a day from 2007 to 2012 including by shutting
its crude-processing plant at Dunkirk.  Total has started talks with unions on refining capacity in
 France , de Margerie said.  Refineries will close in France and other European
countries because of lower fuel demand, he said.  Total has said it isn’t ruling out closing another French
refinery as it seeks to scale down its European refining and
petrochemicals business by a fifth in five years.  Total struggled with opposition from workers and the state
over the closing of its Dunkirk plant. Protests threatened
national fuel shortages, and Total had to promise the government
in 2010 it wouldn’t close another site for five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
