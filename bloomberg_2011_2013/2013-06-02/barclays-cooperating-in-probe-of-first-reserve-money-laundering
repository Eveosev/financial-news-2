(Corrects company name in headline.)  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, is cooperating as part of a probe into
 money laundering  by the operators of Liberty Reserve SA.  U.S. prosecutors ordered the London-based lender to hand
over records for an account at one of its Spanish branches in
the name of Arthur Budovsky, the Sunday Times reported. Barclays
isn’t being accused of any wrongdoing.  The U.S. last week charged seven people, including
Budovsky, 39, of Costa Rica, and Vladimir Kats, 41, from
Brooklyn, New York, of running an illegal money-transmitting
business that masked more than $6 billion of criminal proceeds.
Prosecutors said they used a digital currency backed by gold
bullion.  Barclays was informed about the investigation last week and
has been cooperating with the authorities, said John McGuinness,
a spokesman for the bank in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
