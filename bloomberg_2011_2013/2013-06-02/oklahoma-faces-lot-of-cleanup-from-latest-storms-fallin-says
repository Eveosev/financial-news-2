Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin said
her state faces “a lot of cleanup” from tornadoes that killed
nine people and injured more than 100 on May 31.  “There are still people missing,” Fallin said today on
CBS’s “Face the Nation” program. “It’s been a very trying
couple of weeks,” she said, referring to a previous burst of
tornadoes that damaged or destroyed more than 3,900 houses and
businesses May 20, as well as last week’s storms.  The May 31 storms struck during rush hour traffic after
businesses let employees leave early to seek safety, Fallin
said. “The highways were just packed,” she said on CBS.  Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes caused $15 billion in
insured losses last year, according to the  Insurance Information
Institute  in  New York . They were the second-highest cause of
catastrophic loss, totaling $130.2 billion from 1992 to 2011,
after hurricanes and tropical storms, the institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
