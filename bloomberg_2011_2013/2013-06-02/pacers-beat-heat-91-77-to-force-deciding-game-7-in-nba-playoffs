Paul George  scored 28 points to help
the  Indiana Pacers  defeat the Miami Heat 91-77 to force a
deciding Game 7 in the National Basketball Association Eastern
Conference championship series.  The winner of the series, which will be determined tomorrow
in Miami, will meet the Western Conference champion San Antonio
Spurs for the NBA title. The Pacers haven’t advanced to the NBA
Finals since they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers 4-2 in 2000.  “Myself and David (West), we throw ourselves in the fray,
in the paint,” said  Roy Hibbert , who had 24 points and 11
rebounds. “We like to muck it up. Paul and myself, we wanted to
make sure we got this for him as well. We didn’t want this to be
our last game.”  The defending champion Heat had a 40-39 halftime advantage
before the Pacers started their surge toward building a 17-point
lead, 66-49, after D.J. Augustin scored his only basket with 59
seconds left in the third quarter.  The Heat rallied in the fourth with a 13-4 run to trail by
four points at 72-68 with six minutes left in the game before
the Pacers started rebuilding their lead to 15 points.  “Roy Hibbert is making extraordinary plays in the pocket,
poise in the pocket we call it,” Pacers coach Frank Vogel told
reporters. “He’s getting paint catches and just having great
poise, great reads. He’s not plowing over guys. He had a charge
in Game 5, but has been under control.”  LeBron James  had 29 points for the Heat.  Chris Bosh  was 1-of-8 and  Dwyane Wade  was 3-of-11 from the field as Miami was
held to 36 percent shooting.  James said the Heat was overwhelmed in the third quarter
with the Pacers outshooting Miami 29-15.  “Explain it? You seen it. It was total domination by the
Pacers in the third,” James said during a press conference.
“They made a lot of shots, we didn’t get too many stops and we
missed some very, very easy shots.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
