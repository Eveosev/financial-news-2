Jose Mourinho will rejoin Chelsea as
coach during the offseason, Sky Sports cited Real Madrid
President Florentino Perez as telling the broadcaster.  Mourinho had his last game in charge of Real yesterday, a
4-2 home win over Osasuna. The team finished in second place in
the league, 15 points behind Barcelona.  The Portuguese coach has repeatedly been linked in press
reports with a return to Chelsea, where he won two league
titles, an F.A. Cup and two League Cups before leaving in 2007.
He went on to win the Champions League with Inter Milan in 2010
and the Spanish league with Real in 2012.  Separately,  England ’s Premier League said a story on its
website announcing the return of Mourinho to  Stamford  Bridge was
a “publishing error” and it had no inside knowledge of any
deal, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported. The story, dated
June 3, was later removed from the league’s website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
