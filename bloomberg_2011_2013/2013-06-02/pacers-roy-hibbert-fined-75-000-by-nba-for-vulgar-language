Roy Hibbert of the Indiana Pacers was
fined $75,000 by the National Basketball Association yesterday
for using “inappropriate and vulgar language” during his news
conference following Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals
against the Miami Heat.  Hibbert, 26, had used a gay slur in response to a question
about his defense on LeBron James and also cursed when
responding to a question about why he finished so low in the
NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year voting. The Pacers center
apologized for his remarks yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  “While Roy has issued an apology, which is no doubt
sincere, a fine is necessary to reinforce that such offensive
comments will not be tolerated by the NBA,” league Commissioner
David Stern said in a statement.  Hibbert had 24 points and 11 rebounds in the Pacers’ 91-77
victory two days ago that tied the playoff series at three games
apiece and forced a decisive Game 7 today in Miami.  Hibbert said his comments were “disrespectful and
offensive,” and not a reflection of his personal views.  “I used a slang term that is not appropriate in any
setting, private or public,” he said, “And the language I used
definitely has no place in a public forum, especially over live
television. I apologize to those who I have offended, to our
fans and to the Pacers’ organization.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
