Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King 
said the British public have “every right to be angry” with
banks for the financial crisis.  “In many ways, when the crisis hit in 2007-08 I was
surprised that people weren’t angry sooner,” King said in an
interview for BBC Radio 4’s “Desert Island Discs” program,
broadcast today. “You can see it coming through now as the
impact on standards of living becomes more obvious and they have
every right to be angry.”  He said the crisis was not caused by a few individuals but
by “a crisis of the system of banking we had allowed to grow
up.”  “It’s very important we don’t demonise the individuals but
we do keep cracking on with changing the system,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
