Japan Airlines Co. said it had to
replace a Boeing Co. 787 with another plane after a sensor
indicated a problem with the Dreamliner’s battery box.  Tape covering two holes used to regulate airflow in case of
a battery fault in the auxiliary power unit was not removed
after testing, triggering the alert, JAL said in a statement
today. “The battery showed no abnormality,” it added.  The global 787 fleet has only just begun resuming
operations after a battery flaw in January triggered a worldwide
grounding that also halted new deliveries. Boeing had to modify
the battery system to address safety concerns.  JAL replaced the Dreamliner to be used for Flight JL021
with a Boeing 767-300, incurring a 1 hour 5 minute delay in the
process. The swap took place at Haneda airport in  Tokyo .  The affected Dreamliner had flown twice the day before
without incident, JAL said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
