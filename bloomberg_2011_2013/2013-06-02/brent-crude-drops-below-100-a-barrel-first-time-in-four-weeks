Brent crude  fell below $100 a barrel
for the first time in a month and WTI declined as signs of a
slowing Chinese economy and OPEC’s decision to maintain
production boosted speculation supply will outstrip demand.  Brent slid as much as 0.7 percent to $99.67 a barrel, while
WTI dropped as much as 0.8 percent. Chinese manufacturing
indexes showed small businesses struggling, sapping momentum in
the economy of the world’s second-biggest oil user. The
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries maintained its
output ceiling of 30 million barrels a day at a meeting in
Vienna on May 31. Crude inventories in the U.S., the world’s
biggest consumer of the commodity, are at the highest since at
least 1931.  “We’re in the situation where the market is vulnerable to
downside risk because of the supply situation with a well-covered market,” said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at
CMC Markets in Sydney.  Brent oil for July settlement was at $99.68 a barrel, down
71 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at
3:31 p.m. Singapore time. It last traded below $100 on May 2.
Prices slid 2.2 percent last week and 1.9 percent in May.  WTI for July delivery was at $91.40 a barrel, down 57
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Prices dropped 2.3 percent last week and 1.6 percent
in May. Brent was at a premium of $8.28 to WTI futures, compared
with $8.42 on May 31.  Reduced Forecast  JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its forecast for Brent to an
average of $113 a barrel in the third quarter, from $120
previously, according to a report e-mailed today. The bank
reduced its outlook for the three months ended December to $117
from $120, and for 2014 to $117.50 from $122.50.  WTI is poised to extend losses after failing to breach
chart resistance for a second day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures on May 31 halted an intraday advance below
the middle Bollinger Band, around $94 a barrel today, signaling
it’s where sell orders may be clustered. Crude’s moving average
convergence-divergence indicator also fell below zero for the
first time in a month, showing a loss of technical momentum.  China’s official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for smaller
companies fell to 47.3 in May from 47.6 the previous month, even
as the broader gauge rose to 50.8 from 50.6, the government said
June 1. A private manufacturing index today that includes small
enterprises fell more than forecast to 49.2, an eight-month low,
from 50.4. Levels below 50 signal contraction.  Shale Study  Most OPEC member states expressed their support for crude
at about $100 a barrel last week. Some, including  Venezuela ,
voiced concern that excessive production by other members will
curb prices. OPEC is pumping about 1 million barrels a day more
than the target.  The group signaled growing unease with the U.S. oil boom by
starting a study into shale at its meeting. A committee will
consider the effect of shale oil on the global market for OPEC
crude “in the not-too-distant future,” said Diezani Alison-Madueke,  Nigeria ’s petroleum minister.  U.S. crude  output  rose 34,000 barrels to 7.29 million a day
in the week ended May 24, according to data from the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical
arm. Production reached 7.37 million barrels a day in the week
ended May 3, the most since February 1992. Output has surged as
the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing,
or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale formations.  ‘Dangerous Road’  OPEC will next gather on Dec. 4. The 12-nation group’s
production has fluctuated from 30.6 million to 32.4 million
barrels a day since its current target was introduced in
December 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Daily output was
31.03 million in May, the most in six months, with  Saudi Arabia 
 pumping  9.35 million, according to the data.  “Prices have fallen but the prices are still where the
Saudis would want them to be,” Robin Mills, the head of
consulting at Dubai-based Manaar Energy Consulting and Project
Management, said yesterday. “The Saudis would have made the
argument to some of the others who were asking for a cut that
that’s a dangerous road to go down because once you start
cutting and try to keep prices artificially high you just put
yourself in a more dangerous situation. You just encourage
competition.”  Hedge funds  reduced bullish WTI crude bets by the most in
six weeks, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s May 31 Commitments of Traders report. Money
managers cut net-long positions, or wagers on higher prices, by
6.2 percent in the week ended May 28. It was the largest drop
since the seven days ended April 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
