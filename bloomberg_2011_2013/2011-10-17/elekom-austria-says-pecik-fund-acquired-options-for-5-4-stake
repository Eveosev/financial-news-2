Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , Austria’s former
phone monopoly, said a fund owned by tycoon Ronny Pecik acquired
options to buy 5.4 percent of the company’s voting rights,
sending the shares to the highest in almost two weeks.  Marathon Zwei Beteiligungs GmbH, a subsidiary of Pecik’s
RPR Privatstiftung investment vehicle, held the  call options  as
of Oct. 14 and can exercise them any time until June 18, Vienna-
based Telekom Austria said in a statement today. RPR and its
units already own 374,721 shares, equivalent to 0.08 percent,
bringing the investor’s total shareholding to almost 5.5
percent, according to the statement.  Pecik and three other investors are targeting a 20 percent
stake in Telekom Austria, Format magazine reported Sept. 9. The
group would buy a 15 percent holding from Capital Research &
Management Co., it said, without citing anyone.  Telekom Austria 
has employed Bank of America Merrill Lynch to ward off a
takeover attempt, according to an Oct. 3 report by
WirtschaftsBlatt newspaper.  Elisabeth Mattes, a spokeswoman for Telekom Austria, said
the company “welcomes any new investors.” Pecik didn’t
immediately return voicemail messages from Bloomberg News
seeking comment.  Telekom Austria rose as much as 2.3 percent to 8.44 euros,
the highest intraday price since Oct. 5, and was up 1.6 percent
at 2:39 p.m. in Vienna. That values the phone company, whose
biggest shareholder is the Austrian state through
Oesterreichische Industrieholding AG, at 3.7 billion euros ($5
billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
