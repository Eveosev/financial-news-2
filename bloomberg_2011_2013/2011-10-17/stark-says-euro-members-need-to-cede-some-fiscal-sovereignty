European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said euro states will need to
“transfer” some control of their economies to prevent another
crisis.  “We need a genuine economic union to go ahead with real
political union,” Stark told European lawmakers in Brussels.
“That means to give up national sovereignty over macroeconomic
objectives.”  Stark, who resigned last month in protest over purchases of
 government bonds  by the ECB, also told the parliamentarians that
common bonds issued by euro nations will not solve the crisis.
Stark said today he expects to stay in office until the end of
the year.  Europe’s policy makers are under pressure to find a
solution to a crisis that has raged for two years, brought
 Greece  to the brink of default and is now threatening to tip the
global economy into recession. The ECB has shouldered the main
burden of keeping Europe’s banks afloat by flooding the system
with liquidity and making some asset purchases.  “Do not be mistaken that there is an alternative silver
bullet that will resolve the current crisis and prevent future
ones, such as the issuing of euro bonds,” Stark said. “More
 Europe  is the solution, and not less Europe.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
