Olympus Corp. (7733) , the Japanese camera
and medical-equipment maker, fell by a record for a second
straight day after at least six brokerages cut their ratings
following the dismissal of President Michael C. Woodford.  The shares tumbled as much as 24 percent, the most since
at least Sept. 11, 1974 -- according to data compiled by Bloomberg
-- to 1,561 yen and traded down 17 percent at 9:28 a.m. in Tokyo. 
The stock plunged 18 percent on Oct. 14, the day the company 
announced the ouster of Woodford following disagreements about 
his management methods.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Nomura Holdings Inc. and at least
four other brokerages slashed their ratings on the Tokyo-based
company’s stock. Woodford commissioned an external auditor’s
report, which found that Olympus should investigate payments
made to advisers in connection with an acquisition, according to
a copy of the report obtained by Bloomberg News.  “The board’s explained rationale completely contradicts
its praise for Woodford less than two weeks ago,” Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. analysts Toshiya Hari and Kenya Moriuchi wrote in a
report dated Oct. 14. The bank downgraded the stock to
“neutral” from “buy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
