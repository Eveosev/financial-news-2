Mol Nyrt. rose to the highest in
more than six weeks after an oil discovery in Pakistan and a
report  Hungary  may end extraordinary taxes on industries
including energy and telecommunications.  Hungary’s largest refiner strengthened as much as 3.1
percent and finished 1.5 percent up at 17,300 forint by the end
of trade in Budapest, the highest closing price since Aug. 31.
The benchmark BUX index, in which Mol has a 32 percent
weighting, advanced as much as 2.9 percent and was less than 0.1
percent higher at the close.  Hungary may no longer levy extraordinary taxes on the
energy, retail and telecommunication industries after 2012 while
halving a similar tax on the financial industry, Portfolio.hu
reported, citing revenue forecasts included in next year’s
budget bill. Mari Gas Co., a Pakistani energy exploration
company partially owned by Mol’s local unit, discovered crude
oil in the Karak block, Mari Gas said late on Oct. 14.  The portfolio report on taxes has “positive implications
for Mol,” Peter Csaszar, an analyst at KBC Securities in
Warsaw, wrote in a research report today. The Pakistani oil find
is a “positive development,” Csaszar said. “The attractive
fiscal terms in  Pakistan  mean this could be another valuable
discovery for Mol.”  Magyar Telekom Nyrt., Hungary’s former phone monopoly
controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG, rose 1 percent to 506 forint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
