Austrian banks may need as much as 4
billion euros ($5.5 billion) in additional capital as part of a
Europe-wide recapitalization program, according to three people
with knowledge of the situation.  The estimate is based on a “worst case” assumed minimum
capital ratio of 9 percent for  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ,  Raiffeisen
Bank International AG (RBI)  and  Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) , said
the people who declined to be identified because the plans are
private.  The estimate is based on data requested by the European
Banking Authority and also assumes a writedown of sovereign debt
holdings to market prices, the people said.  Central banks and the Group of 20 finance ministers have
set an Oct. 23 deadline for the delivery of a plan to avoid a
Greek default and bolster Europe’s banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
