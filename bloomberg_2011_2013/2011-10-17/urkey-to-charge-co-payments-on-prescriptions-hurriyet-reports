Turkey  plans to ask for co-payments
of three liras ($1.6) for prescriptions written by family
doctors, Hurriyet newspaper reported, citing Health Minister
Recep Akdag.  The step is part of a set of measures designed to reduce
waste, Akdag said, according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.
There will also be measures to discourage unnecessary use of
emergency and trauma clinics, where treatment is free, Akdag
said, according to Hurriyet.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
