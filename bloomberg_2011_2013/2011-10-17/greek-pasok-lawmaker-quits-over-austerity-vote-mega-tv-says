Greek socialist party lawmaker
Thomas Robopoulos submitted his resignation today, surrendering
his seat ahead of a Parliament vote on austerity measures,
Athens-based Mega TV reported, without saying how it got the
information.  The resignation means Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will
be able to replace Robopoulos with another member of the ruling
party, leaving Papandreouâ€™s majority in Parliament unchanged,
Mega said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
