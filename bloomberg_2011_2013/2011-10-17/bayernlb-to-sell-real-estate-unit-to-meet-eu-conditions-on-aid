Bayerische Landesbank , a German
state-owned lender bailed out in 2008, is likely to sell a real-
estate unit to meet conditions set by the European Union for the
aid.  BayernLB will probably sell its 92 percent stake in GBW AG
because of the EU’s requirement that the company focus on its
main businesses, Bavarian Finance Minister Georg Fahrenschon
said in an e-mail from the ministry’s press department today.  Talks about BayernLB’s overhaul are taking longer than
desired and the EU isn’t close to reaching a decision on the
plan, EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said last
month. The bank needed 10 billion euros ($13.9 billion) in
additional capital and a 4.8 billion-euro guarantee for a
portfolio of asset-backed securities from its home state during
the global financial crisis.  Towns, municipalities and savings banks will be among
potential investors invited to make offers for GBW, the minister
said. BayernLB will try to ensure that any prospective owner
respects guidelines on rent adjustment and renovation, according
to the e-mailed comments.  As part of its overhaul, the lender announced plans in 2008
to refocus operations and reduce the workforce by 2013.  GBW owns about 33,000 homes in the southern German state of
Bavaria, according to its  website .  Deutsche Presse-Agentur 
reported Fahrenschon’s comments earlier today.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm,
investigates whether state subsidies to lenders distort
competition in the 27-nation EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
