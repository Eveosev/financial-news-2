Euro-area plans to ensure banks have
additional capital buffers are a “distraction” from the need
to address sovereign-debt risks, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc said.  “This is not the 2008/2009 crisis where the focus was on
private-sector debt and the fragility of bank-lending
decisions,”  Harvinder Sian  and Simon Peck, London-based
interest-rate strategists at RBS, wrote in an investor report on
Oct. 14. “This crisis is about the fragility of vast amounts of
periphery European Monetary Union debt as default risk of
sovereigns becomes more probable. These sovereign debt issues
are only being dealt with half-heartedly.”  Sian and Peck said in the note their “view on the
periphery remains deeply negative to the point that we think all
European  government bonds  except bunds are speculative.” That’s
likely to push benchmark German bund yields 50 basis points
lower over two months, they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
