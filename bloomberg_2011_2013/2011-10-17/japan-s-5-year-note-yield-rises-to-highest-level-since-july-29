Japan ’s five-year note yield rose to
the highest level since July 29 as advancing stocks damped
demand for the relative safety of government debt. The yield
climbed half a basis point to 0.38 percent as of 9:25 a.m. in
 Tokyo . A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
