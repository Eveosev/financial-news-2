General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , the
second-largest U.S. mall owner, refinanced $966 million of
adjustable-rate mortgages on four properties into fixed-rate
loans with an average term of 9.1 years.  The real estate investment trust’s share of the new loans
totals $483 million after adjusting for the company’s ownership
in the shopping malls, Chicago-based General Growth said today
in a statement. The refinancings lowered the interest rate to an
average 4.63 percent from 5.66 percent on the prior maturing
mortgages.  General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, has been refinancing debt to lower expenses and plans
to redevelop, expand and refurbish malls to boost growth. The
new loans meet the company’s financing plans for this year,
according to the statement.  “We have accomplished our 2011 goals and are now focused
on 2012 financing opportunities,” Chief Executive Officer
 Sandeep Mathrani  said in the statement.  The newly refinanced malls are Natick Mall in Natick,
Massachusetts; Galleria at Tyler, in Riverside,  California ;
First Colony Mall in  Sugar Land , Texas; and Northbrook Court in
Northbrook, Illinois.  General Growth has ownership and management interest in 166
malls in 43 states, totaling 169 million square feet (15.7
million square meters), the company said in the statement. It is
second in size to Simon Property Group Inc., based in
Indianapolis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
