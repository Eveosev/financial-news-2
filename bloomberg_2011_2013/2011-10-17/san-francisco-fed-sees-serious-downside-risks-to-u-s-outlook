Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis poses
a “serious” risk that growth in the U.S. and worldwide may
fall below already reduced forecasts, according to a paper from
the Federal Reserve Bank of  San Francisco .  “The economic outlook has worsened,” research adviser
Bharat Trehan wrote in a paper released on the bank’s Web site
today. As European policy makers grapple with a solution, the
crisis “has led to increased volatility in financial markets,
with alternating spells of optimism and pessimism.”  The San Francisco Fed, one of 12 regional banks in the Fed
system, expects real gross domestic product to expand only
“moderately” at a rate that’s unlikely to push unemployment
below 9.1 percent this year. Growth in the third quarter
probably picked up to a 2 percent annual pace from 1.3 percent
pace in the second quarter, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of economists.  Europe ’s crisis “creates a significant risk that economic
growth, both globally and in the  United States , could fall
noticeably below” forecasts, Trehan wrote. “There are some
serious downside risks to this outlook,” he added.  In September,  John Williams , president of the San Francisco
Fed, cut his growth forecast for the rest of 2011. The bank
chief said he expects 2 percent growth for the final six months
of 2011, compared with his 3 percent forecast in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
