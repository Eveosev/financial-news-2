Private-equity firms are sitting on
$937 billion in unspent capital, with more than 20 percent in
funds that usually would have to invest the money within about
two years, according to Preqin Ltd.  Funds raised in 2008 have $204 billion in so-called dry
powder as economic uncertainty and a tight deal market led them
to delay some investing, the London-based research firm said
today in a statement. With an average investment period of five
years, these funds will be under pressure to put the money to
work and avoid asking clients for extensions, Preqin said.  “Recent years have been characterized by private-equity
managers delaying their investments for longer than before,”
Alex Jones, a Preqin analyst, said in the statement. “The
industry could see a repeat of the flurry of deals and exit
activity that took place throughout 2010 as managers put this
cash to work and realize their investments.”  Private-equity firms are struggling to make acquisitions
amid a reluctance by banks to lend. Leveraged buyouts have
fallen 12 percent to $87.2 billion this year from the same
period a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  About 41 percent of dry powder is held by leveraged-buyout
funds, according to Preqin. LBO funds raised in 2008 have about
$91.5 billion in unspent commitments, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
