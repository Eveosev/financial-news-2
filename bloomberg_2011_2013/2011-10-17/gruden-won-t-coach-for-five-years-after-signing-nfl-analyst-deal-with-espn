Former Super Bowl-winning coach Jon Gruden agreed to a contract extension with ESPN that will keep
him as a “Monday Night Football” analyst through the 2016
National Football League season.  Gruden, who is in his third season with  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) 
network’s ESPN, agreed to an exclusive agreement that will keep
him “out of coaching for the next five years,” ESPN said in a
statement.  “Our ‘Monday Night Football’ crew is special, and to have
the opportunity to continue to be a part of this team, working
these big-time NFL prime time games every week on ESPN, I’m
fired up,” Gruden said in the statement.  Gruden, 48, coached the  Oakland Raiders  for four years
before replacing Tony Dungy with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in
2002. He led the team to a Super Bowl title that season and won
five division crowns during his 11 years as a head coach.  His name has been mentioned for several coaching openings
in both the NFL and college football since he moved into the
broadcast booth. Gruden signed a one-year extension with ESPN
last December after the  University of Miami  expressed interest
in signing him following the firing of Randy Shannon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
