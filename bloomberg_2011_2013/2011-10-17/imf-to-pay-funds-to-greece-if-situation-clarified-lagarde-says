The  International Monetary Fund  will
release funds to  Greece  if the country’s economic situation is
clarified, IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said today on
Europe 1 radio.  Lagarde also said that the IMF currently has
“appropriate” resources to meet its needs. State support for
banks should be a last resort, she added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
