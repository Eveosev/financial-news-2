Royal Philips Electronics NV, the
Dutch maker of lighting equipment, medical devices and consumer
electronics, said it plans to cut 4,500 jobs globally, of which
1,400 will be in the Netherlands, as part of a plan to lower
costs by 800 million euros.  “Through this program, Philips is investing in growth,
addressing structural change, focusing on execution, reducing
overhead costs and adopting a new company culture,” Philips
said in the statement today, as it reported earnings for the
third quarter.  Philips said about 60 percent of the savings are related to
the job cuts, while the remaining 40 percent are tied to “other
structural costs.” The company reiterated its mid-term earnings
targets today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
