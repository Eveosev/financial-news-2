Holiday travel spending will rise
about 8 percent this year for the average U.S. family, even as
the number of Americans making a trip will remain unchanged from
last year, an  American Express Co. (AXP)  survey showed.  A family of four plans to spend $2,636 on holiday travel,
an increase of almost $200 from a year earlier, American Express
said in a statement today. Three in 10 Americans plan to travel
during the holiday period, unchanged from 2010, the company
said, citing results from its Spending & Saving Tracker.  Forty-two percent of those that plan to travel said they
would spend more this year on the trips during the U.S. holiday
season, which typically begins with Thanksgiving in November.
Fifty-six percent donâ€™t plan to travel, down from 61 percent who
stayed home in 2010, the survey said. Travelers flying to their
destinations will rise 10 percentage points to 36 percent.  The survey interviewed a random sample of 2,017 adults from
Sept. 28 to Oct. 2, said New York-based American Express, the
largest credit-card issuer by purchases. The group included
members of the general population and those classified as
affluent or as young professionals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
