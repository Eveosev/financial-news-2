Oberoi Realty Ltd. (OBER) ,  India ’s second-
largest property developer by market value, had the biggest gain
in more than five months in Mumbai trading after second-quarter
profit rose 17 percent as sales growth beat analysts’ estimates.  The shares jumped as much as 7.5 percent, the most since
June 1, and traded at 238 rupees as of 9:43 a.m. local time. The
earnings were reported on Oct. 15.   Net income at the Mumbai-based company increased to 1.11
billion rupees ($22.7 million) in the quarter ended Sept. 30,
from 955 million rupees a year earlier. That was in line with
the 1 billion rupee median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey. Sales climbed 31 percent to 2.2 billion rupees,
higher than the 1.73 billion rupee estimate.  “Oberoi’s profit was largely in line with our expectations,
but revenue came in ahead of our estimates,” said Aatash Shah,
a Mumbai-based analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.  The higher revenue was primarily from the completion of the
company’s Oberoi Splendor project in Mumbai during the quarter,
and better-than-expected construction progress at its
residential projects during the monsoon season, Shah said in a
note to clients dated yesterday.  Oberoi Realty, backed by Morgan Stanley, raised 10.3
billion rupees after selling shares at 260 rupees each in an
initial public offering in October last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
