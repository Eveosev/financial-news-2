Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said the Oct. 23 European leaders summit will build
on “positive” decisions reached in July and that critical
negotiations will take place.  “Right now it’s necessary to understand we must all fight
together for change and we must be united and calm in order to
achieve the best result on Sunday and show that Greece can and
will, that it is meeting its targets, moving forward,”
Papandreou said.  He spoke in comments televised live on Athens-based Mega TV
