French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is
open to the proposal of a special European Commissioner to
ensure that euro-area countries obey rules on spending and
budget deficits, said Netherlands Prime Minister  Mark Rutte , who
has been pushing the idea.  “Sarkozy looks at it positively, but the powers of the
commissaire would have to be defined,” Rutte told reporters
after meeting with the French leader in Paris today. “Our aides
are working on it. Triple-A countries like the Netherlands,
France, and  Germany  are paying for Greece, Portugal, and
Ireland. Why? Because they didn’t stick to their obligations.”  The idea of the special commissioner is one of the subjects
that will be discussed at a meeting of European Union heads of
government Oct. 23, Rutte said, along with aid to  Greece , ways
to improve the workings of the euro region’s rescue fund and
bank recapitalizations.  A French official, who can’t be named because he isn’t
authorized to speak to the press, said Rutte’s idea of a special
commissioner deserves to be discussed. He said the task could be
given to an existing member of the commission.  On banks, Rutte said he and Sarkozy agreed that lenders
needing new capital should first seek it from private investors,
then from their own governments, and only finally from the
European Financial Stability Facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
