Following is a summary of the eurozone
September competitiveness index from the  European Central Bank  in Frankfurt:  NOTE: The purpose of harmonized competitiveness indicators (HCIs), which 
are based on consumer price indices, is to provide a consistent and 
comparable measure of euro area countriesâ€™ price competitiveness that is 
also consistent with the real effective  exchange rate  (EER) of the euro. 
The HCIs are constructed using the same methodology and data sources that 
are used for the euro EER. While the HCI of a specific country takes into 
account both intra and extra-euro area trade, however, the euro EER is 
based on extra-euro area trade only. Therefore, the HCIs and euro EER 
reflect different phenomena and are not directly comparable. The HCIs 
complement other competitiveness indicators published by some NCBs which 
may follow different methodologies and, in some cases, use different 
price measures in order to account for the specific circumstances in the 
respective country.  The real effective exchange rate of the euro vis-a-vis 41 trading partners 
is displayed.   To contact the reporter on this story:
