New York ’s  Metropolitan Opera  saw
private donations recover in the recession’s wake last year,
rising 21.7 percent to about $127 million, according to a survey
released today.  The Miami-based  New World Symphony , which is pursuing a
$200 million capital campaign to expand its campus, had the
largest percentage increase in private gifts last year.
Donations rose to $52.1 million from about $6.2 million in 2009,
according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.  Yet the  U.S. economy  still struggled long after the
recession’s official end in mid-2009, and compared to the Met,
many of the 400 largest U.S.-based nonprofits surveyed by the
Chronicle felt the squeeze. In 2010, the same group saw private
gifts rise by a median 3.5 percent after a record 11 percent
decline in 2009.  “The fundraising environment is still really tough,” said
Chronicle editor Stacy Palmer by phone. “There are pockets of
the economy that are brighter than others, but most charities
are finding that it’s extraordinarily difficult to raise money.”  Donations to Goldman Sachs Gives, the charitable fund
started by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in 2007, dropped 36.4
percent to $123.2 million last year. New York’s Metropolitan
Museum of Art saw a 5.3 percent drop in private funding to about
$131 million.  Arts nonprofits that saw steep declines in private giving
include the  Lincoln Center  for the Performing Arts with a 42.4
percent drop to $46.4 million, the  New York Public Library  down
6.6 percent to $70.3 million, and the Art Institute of  Chicago ,
with a 32.5 percent plunge from about $58.5 million last year.  Humane Society   Gifts to the Humane Society of the U.S. rose 35.2 percent
to $131.2 million last year, while the  World Wildlife Fund 
climbed 9.9 percent to $124.5 million. The Memphis-based Ducks
Unlimited, which works to protect the habitats of wildlife, saw
private funding decline by 33 percent to $98.7 million last
year.  “Nonprofits are going to have to try different fundraising
techniques and not rely on one,” Palmer said. “A lot of groups
are thinking already that it’s going to take years before the
economy recovers and their fundraising recovers along with it.”  To contact the writer on this story:
