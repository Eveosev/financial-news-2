Vivus Inc. (VVUS)  resubmitted its Qnexa
obesity treatment for U.S. regulatory approval after updating
the label to say the drug shouldnâ€™t be used by women capable of
having children.  Vivus is seeking clearance from the  Food and Drug
Administration  for Qnexa as a treatment for obese or overweight
patients with weight-related disorders such as high blood
pressure or diabetes.  The FDA rejected Qnexa last October citing concerns the
medicine may cause  birth defects  and increased heart rate. In
addition to the label warning, the resubmission includes a risk
evaluation and mitigation strategy, the Mountain View,
California-based company said today in a statement.  Vivus was unchanged at $8.58 at 4 p.m.  The FDA will schedule an advisory panel in the first
quarter of next year and a final decision on whether the drug is
approved would come in the second quarter of 2012, Vivus said
when it announced it would resubmit the application Sept. 15.  Vivus has been competing with San Diego-based  Arena
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARNA)  and La Jolla, California-based  Orexigen
Therapeutics Inc. (OREX)  to sell the first new prescription diet pill
in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
