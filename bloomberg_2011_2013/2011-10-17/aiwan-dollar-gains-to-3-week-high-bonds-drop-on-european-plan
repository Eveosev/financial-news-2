Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to the
strongest level in more than three weeks and government bonds
declined on speculation  Europe ’s leaders are moving closer to
containing the region’s debt crisis.  The currency gained for a third day after finance ministers
and central banks from the Group of 20 nations endorsed parts of
a plan to avoid a Greek default. Taiwan’s government sold NT$40
billion ($1.3 billion) of five-year bonds today at 1.08 percent
today, higher than the 1.05 percent median estimate of five
finance companies in a Bloomberg survey.  “News out of Europe is bolstering risk sentiment and
hurting bonds,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “In the short run, yields will go
up.”  Taiwan’s dollar closed 0.7 percent stronger at NT$30.100
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$30.018 earlier, the strongest level since Sept. 21.  The yield on the government’s 2 percent bonds due July
2016, the most-traded security, rose three basis points to
1.072, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.395 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
