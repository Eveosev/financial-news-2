Premiums for Middle East oil for
sale to  Asia  rose for a fourth day as increased refining profits
spurred demand.  Qatar Marine for loading in December climbed 11 cents to a
premium of 44 cents to its official selling price, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co., gained 3 cents to a premium of 20 cents.  Refinery demand is increasing as plants expand processing
runs to take advantage of more positive margins. Gasoil’s
premium to Dubai crude averaged $16 a barrel in the week to Oct.
14, up from $13.39 a year earlier, data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a London-based brokerage, show. Fuel oil’s discount to the
Middle East benchmark narrowed to $4.54 today, according to PVM.  “We expect solid demand and the favorable fuel oil crack
to continue to prop up Middle Eastern grades in the coming
weeks,” said JBC Energy GmbH in its weekly Asian Report.  Dubai swaps for November narrowed to a premium of $1.73 a
barrel today compared with January after reaching $1.88 on Oct.
14, according to data from PVM. This market situation known as
backwardation suggests demand is greater for immediate shipments.  Oman crude for immediate loading increased $1.43, or 1.4
percent, to $107.67 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in December rose 1.4 percent to $107.24. Murban for
spot delivery climbed 1.4 percent to $112.03.  Oman futures for December delivery rose 50 cents to $109.50
a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:10 p.m. Singapore
time with 1,394 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$110.03 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The December Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
narrowed $1.25 to $5.85 a barrel, said PVM. The exchange for
swaps for January fell $1.04 to $4.94.  To contact the reporter on this story:
