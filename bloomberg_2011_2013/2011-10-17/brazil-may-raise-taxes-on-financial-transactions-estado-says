Brazil â€™s tax agency plans to impose
a tax to shareholders who get additional stock when a company
uses its profit to increase capital by distributing shares, O
Estado de S. Paulo reported, citing a presidential decree to be
voted in Congress.  The agency is also seeking to charge a 25 percent income
tax on profits the company or shareholders get from so-called
fiscal paradises, the newspaper said. The decree reduces to 24
from 50 the number of days a trader has to account profit made
by buying and selling shares, Estado said.  All the measures were included in a government proposal to
reduce payroll taxes for manufacturers of software, textiles,
furniture and shoes, Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
