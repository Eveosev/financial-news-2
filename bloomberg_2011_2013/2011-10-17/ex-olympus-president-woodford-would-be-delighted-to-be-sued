Former  Olympus Corp. (7733)  President
Michael C. Woodford said he would be “delighted” to be sued by
the company, which fired him this month.  Olympus Executive Vice President Hisashi Mori, said he is
considering legal action against Woodford for leaking information
to the press.  Woodford said today he met with the U.K. Serious Fraud
Office, which investigates corruption, and gave it documents
including a report that he commissioned that raised the
possibility of illegal conduct. He asked the proecutors to
investigate payments Olympus made to advisers related to a 2008
acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
