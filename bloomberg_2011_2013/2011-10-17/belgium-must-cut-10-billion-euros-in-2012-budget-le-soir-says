Belgium ’s Prime Minister-designate
Elio Di Rupo must find 10 billion euros ($13.9 billion) of
savings as he leads six-party talks to draft the 2012 budget and
form a government, Le Soir reported.  The parties will try to reconcile a report by the
monitoring committee, made up of administration experts, that
estimates the budget gap next year at 10 billion euros, and Di
Rupo’s proposed solutions, the Brussels-based newspaper said
today.  Talks begin today at 1:00 p.m. local time, Le Soir said.  “Take a breath of fresh air, clear the head after 14
hellish days and before a week when much will happen,”
caretaker Prime Minister  Yves Leterme  posted yesterday on
Twitter. “A crucial week for our well-being.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
