The two sons of former President
 Hosni Mubarak , Alaa and Gamal, have about $340 million deposited
in Swiss banks, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported
today, citing Assistant Justice Minister Assem El-Gohary.  Alaa Mubarak alone has $300 million, MENA said. An Egyptian
judicial committee also found documents that show businessman
Hussein Salem, who was sentenced this month in absentia to seven
years in prison in a corruption-related case, and his two
children have more than 24 billion Egyptian pounds ($4 billion)
held in several countries, the news agency said.  The Swiss government has frozen 410 million francs ($458
million) of assets connected to Mubarak, his family and
associates. Gamal and Alaa are standing trial alongside their
father on corruption charges. Mubarak is also accused of
conspiring to kill some of the protesters who swept him from
power in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
