Proposals to separate investment and
retail banking are “interesting approaches” for international
talks about financial-market regulation, German Finance Ministry
spokesman Johannes Blankenheim said.  “These ideas, these suggestions should be discussed
intensively at the international level, especially to solve open
questions such as the definition of the retail and investment
business and the repercussions on the real economy,”
Blankenheim said when asked by reporters today in Berlin about
demands by  Germany ’s opposition Social Democratic Party to
impose a separation.  Bjoern Saenger, a lawmaker from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Free Democratic Party pro-market coalition ally, said in an e-
mailed statement he welcomes the ministry’s readiness to discuss
a separation and is looking forward to any proposals.  The debate in Germany comes after the U.K. government
decided to force lenders to insulate their consumer-banking
units by 2019 as Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
seeks to shield customers and taxpayers from another financial
crisis.  Protest movements such as Occupy  Wall Street , which spread
to four continents this weekend including demonstrations in
Germany, are raising pressure on politicians to shield banks
from taxpayer-led bailouts seen during the 2008 financial
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
