Gold futures fell from a three-week
high as the dollar’s rally reduced demand for the precious metal
as an alternative asset. Silver also dropped.  The greenback climbed as much as 0.8 percent against a
basket of six major currencies as  Germany  damped expectations
for a fast resolution to  Europe ’s debt crisis. The dollar jumped
6 percent last month, while gold slumped 11 percent.  “The dollar’s strength is weighing on gold,”  Frank Lesh ,
a trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “Also, some people are waiting on the sidelines
because of the volatility in prices.”  Gold futures for December delivery declined 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,676.60 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Earlier, the price reached $1,696.80, the highest for a
most-active contract since Sept. 23. Last week, the metal gained
2.9 percent, the most in more than a month.  On Sept. 6, gold reached a record $1,923.70 as investors
sought to diversify away from equities and some currencies. The
metal has advanced 22 percent in the past 12 months.  “While there is no rush to buy gold here, it is equally
clear that investors who are long the yellow metal are not
willing to let go of holdings either,”  Edel Tully , a London-
based analyst at UBS AG, said in a report.  Silver futures for December delivery declined 1.1 percent
to $31.821 an ounce. The metal has gained 31 percent in the past
12 months.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,551.80 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery slid 0.6 percent to
$616.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
