Property owners needing to refinance
will fuel issuance of bonds backed by commercial-mortgages to as
much as $30 billion in 2012, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   Sales of securities tied to shopping mall, skyscraper and
hotel loans are projected to be between $25 billion and $30
billion next year, JPMorgan analysts led by Ed Reardon in  New
York  said in an Oct. 14 report.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
estimated last week there will be $20 billion to $30 billion of
transactions in 2012.  About $36 billion in mortgages packaged as bonds matures
next year, said Reardon. Some of those borrowers will turn to
 Wall Street  even as banks pull back from originating new loans
and charge higher  interest rates  after  Europe ’s fiscal crisis
spurred price swings in the $600 billion commercial-mortgage
backed  securities market .  “There is a certain percentage of maturing loans that need
to be refinanced in CMBS,” Reardon said in an e-mail. “The
interest rate is not the only feature that drives
originations.”  Wall Street has arranged about $25.6 billion in commercial
mortgage-backed securities this year, compared with about $11.5
billion in all of 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stockpiles of loans for new deals have shrunk amid
volatility that’s increased since July as Europe’s leaders
failed to stem the region’s sovereign debt crisis. Bank of
America Corp. cut its 2011 issuance forecast to between $25
billion and $30 billion in August after predicting more than $40
billion in new sales.  Sales of the debt plummeted to $3.4 billion in 2009
compared with a record $234 billion in 2007, choking off funding
to borrowers with maturing loans, the data show.  Super Duper Spreads  About half of loans coming due next year should be able to
refinance with as much as $30 billion in projected sales, RBS
analysts Brian Lancaster,  Richard Hill  and Joseph Ruszkowski in
Stamford, Connecticut wrote in their report.  The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries soared to 323
basis points, or 3.23 percentage points, on Oct. 4, the most
since February 2010, according to the Barclays Capital CMBS AAA
Super Duper Index.  Spreads have narrowed to 3.18 percentage points after
widening from 2.26 percentage points at the end of July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
