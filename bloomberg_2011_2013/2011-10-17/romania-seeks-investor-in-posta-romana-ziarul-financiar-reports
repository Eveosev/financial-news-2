Romania is trying to attract an
investor in  Compania Nationala Posta Romana SA , the monopoly
postal service, to boost its capital, Ziarul Financiar reported
today, citing a government document.  The investor would get a 34 percent stake in the
unprofitable company in exchange for the capital increase and
designate managers for at least 10 years, Ziarul Financiar said,
 citing the document . The government would retain 51 percent of
Posta Romana, with the remainder held by property restitution
fund Fondul Proprietatea SA, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
