Turkish sales of  luxury vehicles 
with large engines will drop at least 70 percent after the
government increased the special  consumption tax ,  Hurriyet 
newspaper reported.  Sales of vehicles with engines up to 2 liters in size will
fall 35 to 40 percent in 2012 while sales of vehicles with
larger engines will drop at least 70 percent, the Istanbul-based
newspaper said, citing Borosan Otomotiv Ithalat & Dagitim AS
chief executive Esref Biryildiz.  The tax increase announced last week, to as much as 130
percent of the price of a vehicle, puts distributors that had
invested in stock as they predicted an increase in sales in a
very difficult position, the newspaper said citing Biryildiz and
Audi Turkey general manager Gino Bottaro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
