Breast-cancer  has surpassed  lung
cancer  to become the most-common form of the illness among
Chinese women, the  China  Daily reported today, citing Zhang Jin,
deputy director of the breast cancer center at Tianjin Cancer
Institute and Hospital.  China reports 126,000 new cases of breast cancer each year
and about 37,000 deaths from the disease, according to the
Beijing-based newspaper. A more “western lifestyle,” rising
obesity, and economic growth are the main reasons for the
increase, the newspaper reported, citing Wang Ping, deputy
director of the hospital.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
