Spain ’s opposition party PP leader
Mariano Rajoy plans to merge the country’s energy regulator, or
CNE, and the telecommunications regulator, known as CMT, into
just one entity,  El Mundo  reported, citing unidentified people
close to the PP.  The goal of the merger would be to cut costs and give the
new entity more independence with no political influence over
the choosing of a president and board members, the newspaper
said. The new institution would have two sections, one for
energy and another one for telecommunications, with just one
president, El Mundo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
