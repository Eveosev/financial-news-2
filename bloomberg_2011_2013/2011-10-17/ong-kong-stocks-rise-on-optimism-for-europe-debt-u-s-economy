Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose,
set to gain for a seventh day in eight, on optimism  Europe ’s
debt crisis will be contained, and as economists said the
Chinese economy probably grew more than 9 percent last quarter.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier whose biggest market is
Europe, surged 7.9 percent. Anhui Conch Cement Co.,  China ’s
largest cement maker by market value, jumped 4.7 percent ahead
of the release by the government of economic reports.  Cnooc
Ltd. (883) , China’s No. 1 offshore oil producer, increased 3.3 percent
after commodity prices gained.  The Hang Seng Index rose 2 percent to 18,873.99 as of the 4
p.m. local time close of trade, with all but five stocks rising
in the 46-member gauge. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
Chinese companies listed in  Hong Kong  gained 2.8 percent to
9,853.34. China’s gross domestic product, scheduled to be
released tomorrow, grew 9.5 percent last quarter, according to
the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Retail
sales and industrial production figures are also set to be
released tomorrow.  “There’s a bullish sentiment on the European debt issue,”
driving a sharp rally in global equities, said  Steven Leung ,
director of institutional sales in UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. in
Hong Kong. “There was so much hard-landing concerns in China,
but if we see that the third-quarter growth stand around 9
percent, those worries should be over.”  Yearly Slump  The Hang Seng Index tumbled 20 percent this year through
Oct. 14, making it the worst-performing benchmark index among
developed markets outside the  euro zone . Shares dropped amid
concern Europe’s debt crisis, China’s monetary tightening
measures and a slowdown in the U.S. growth will derail the
global economic recovery.  Companies on the index, which has gained 16 percent since
its recent bottom on Oct. 4, traded at 10 times forecast
earnings, at the last close, around March 2009 levels. That
compares with 12.3 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Esprit surged 7.9 percent to HK$12.52.  Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd. (13) , an owner of ports in Germany and  Spain , increased 3.4
percent to HK$71.75.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which operates
container facilities at  Greece ’s Piraeus port, gained 2.7
percent to HK$10.14.  G-20 finance ministers and central banks concluded weekend
talks in Paris, endorsing parts of an emerging plan to avoid a
Greek debt default, bolster banks and curb contagion. They set
an Oct. 23 summit of European leaders in Brussels as the
deadline for it to be delivered.  ‘Credible Solution’  “An important precondition for resolving the European
credit crisis is unity of vision and commitment to find a
solution,” said  Angus Gluskie , who manages more than $300
million at White Funds Management in Sydney. “The comments over
the weekend show some elements of both. A credible and well-
executed solution is the next element, and we are yet to see
this.”  Cnooc rose 3.3 percent to HK$13.72, while Jiangxi Copper
Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the metal, jumped 6.2 percent to
HK$17.54. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. known as Chalco, surged
6.7 percent HK$4.16.  New York-traded copper futures rose 3.1 percent on Oct. 14,
while the London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six metals
including copper and aluminum advanced 2.1 percent. Crude oil
futures in  New York  gained 3.1 percent.  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175) , the unit of the Chinese
automaker that owns Volvo Cars Corp., rose 5 percent to HK$2.11
after saying its September sales volume advanced about 0.5
percent to 32,430 units from a year earlier.  China Companies  Chinese companies rose ahead of the nation’s economic data.
