PG&E Corp. (PCG) , which owns  California ’s
largest utility, has chosen contractors to complete three solar-
energy projects under construction in Fresno County, California.  The projects total 50 megawatts of capacity and are being
developed as part of a five-year program to own and operate 250
megawatts of photovoltaic projects, San Francisco-based PG&E
 said  today in a posting on its company blog.  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  is building 10-megawatt and 20-megawatt
installations using its solar panels, Lynsey Paulo, a PG&E
spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail. Cupertino Electric Inc.
will build a third, 20-megawatt plant using Suntech Power
Holdings Co. modules, PG&E said. The projects are expected to
begin operating by October 2012. Costs weren’t disclosed.  PG&E also is seeking bids from developers as part of a
separate five-year program to buy power from 250 megawatts of
solar projects.  To contact the reporters on this story:
