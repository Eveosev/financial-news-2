New York ’s Suffolk County suffered
the most insured property damage of 191 U.S. jurisdictions
affected by Hurricane Irene,  Verisk Analytics Inc. (VRSK)  said.  Suffolk and Dare County,  North Carolina , each had more than
$200 million in losses, according to a statement today from
Verisk, the provider of data for the insurance industry.  Chubb Corp. (CB)  and  Allstate Corp. (ALL)  are among insurers that said
they may face higher than usual third-quarter costs from Irene,
which lashed the U.S. East Coast in August. The storm was the
first hurricane to strike the country since 2008 and damaged
property from North Carolina to New York.  “In my 31-year career, I have never encountered such a
confluence of extreme weather events in one quarter,” said
Gregory Murphy, the chief executive officer of  Selective
Insurance Group Inc. (SIGI) , in a statement last week.  Selective had about $70 million in third-quarter
catastrophe costs, most of it from Irene, the Branchville, New
Jersey-based company said in the statement. Its main territory
includes  New Jersey ,  Pennsylvania , New York and  Maryland .  Nassau County, New York; Monmouth County, New Jersey and
Worcester County, Maryland, were among the three other counties
with more than $150 million in damage, Verisk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
