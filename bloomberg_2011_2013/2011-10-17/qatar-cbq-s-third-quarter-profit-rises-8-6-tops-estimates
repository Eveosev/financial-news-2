Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQK) , the
country’s second-biggest lender, said third-quarter profit
jumped 8.6 percent as fee and commission income increased.  Net income rose to 552 million riyals ($152 million) from
508.2 million riyals a year earlier, the bank said in a 
statement  to the Qatar bourse today. The median estimate of four
analysts was for a profit of 480.5 million riyals, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Commercial Bank “delivered balance sheet growth and a
solid income statement,” Ryan Ayache, a Dubai-based banking
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, said in an e-mailed research note.
“Operational performance is well ahead of consensus.”  Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural
gas, forecasts its economy to grow 16 percent this year amid
rising gas and fuel exports. Qatar National Bank SAQ, the
country’s largest lender, posted a 31 percent increase in third-
quarter profit, beating estimates. Doha Bank QSC profit climbed
10 percent in the quarter.  “The results demonstrate positive momentum in both revenue
and lending growth and we will look to maintain this for the
remainder of the year,” Managing Director Hussain Al Fardan
said in a separate statement.  Third-quarter net fee and commission income jumped to 164
million riyals from 122.7 million riyals, while net interest
income rose to 466.3 million riyals from 448.2 million riyals.  The shares have lost 11 percent this year compared with a
2.4 percent drop for the benchmark QE Index. The stock rose 1.2
percent to 82 riyals on the Qatar Exchange today before the
results were announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
