The Bank of  Israel  said today that
based on fiscal developments in the first eight months of this
year its forecast for the 2011  budget deficit  stands at close to
3 percent of the gross domestic product, which is within the
budget framework.  The central bank said in an e-mailed report that in the
months May through August, an accelerated upward trend in
investment began to level off, a possible sign that producers
may no longer see any need for major production expansion given
the expected economic slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
