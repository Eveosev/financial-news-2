China Ming Yang Wind Power Group
Ltd. (MY) , a wind-turbine maker, rose the most in almost a week after
the state-owned China Development Bank Corp. offered as much as
$5 billion in financing.  Ming Yang rose 6.8 percent to $3.00 at the close in  New
York , the most since Oct. 12.  The financing will allow the company to approach
international markets and assure bankability of their turbines,
said Paul Clegg, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New
York, who has had a “buy” recommendation on the stock since
June 30 and a price target of $5 a share since Aug. 16.  “These announcements help make a statement that ‘someone
in the government likes us and we’re well positioned because of
that and because we make quality turbines’,” he said.  China Ming Yang will use the funding to develop its
domestic and international operations, including land-based and
offshore wind turbines, supply chain integration and working
capital management, the Zhongshan, China-based turbine company
said today in a statement.  China Development Bank  will provide loans and credit
facilities worth as much as $5 billion through 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
