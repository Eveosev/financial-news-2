Aquapesca Ltd., a Mozambican prawn
producer that employs 800 people, said it will indefinitely
cease operations at its 350 hectare farm after its stock was
infected by white spot syndrome.  The company, which has been operating for 17 years, has not
established the source of the virus, which has in the past
disrupted prawn farming in south east  Asia  and  South America , it
said in a statement in the Noticias newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
