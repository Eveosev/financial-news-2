The trustee liquidating former  Anglo
Irish Bank  Corp. Chief Executive Officer David K. Drumm’s assets
to help pay creditors owed more than $14 million received court
approval to sell his waterfront home for $3.9 million.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Bailey in  Boston  authorized the
sale of the Cape Cod property in an order dated Oct. 4. It’s
being bought by Three Sisters Trust, or its designee, and sold
by Chapter 7 Trustee Kathleen Dwyer, according to the order.  The house in Chatham,  Massachusetts , was bought for $4.6
million in March 2008, according to documents obtained from the
Barnstable County Registry of Deeds. Drumm resigned in December
2008 and the bank was taken over by the government weeks later.
He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in October 2010,
listing debts of $14.2 million and assets of $13.9 million.  Anglo Irish Bank, now named Irish Bank Resolution Corp.,
reported 17.7 billion euros ($24.5 billion) of pretax losses for
2010 tied to the bursting of the country’s property bubble. The
bank is suing Drumm in Dublin and in the U.S. in connection with
money he allegedly borrowed from the bank. Drumm denies
wrongdoing.  The bank, through external spokeswoman Martha Kavanagh,
declined to comment on the house sale.  An additional $150,000 will be paid for personal property
at the house, bringing the total transaction value to more than
$4 million, court papers show. Lorraine Drumm, Drumm’s wife who
shares an interest in the house and isn’t in bankruptcy, will be
given a portion of the proceeds from the personal-property sale.
The order didn’t specify what items are being sold.  The case is: In re David K. Drumm, 10-21198,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Massachusetts (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
