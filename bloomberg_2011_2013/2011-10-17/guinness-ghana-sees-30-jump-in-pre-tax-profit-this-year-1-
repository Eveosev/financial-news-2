Diageo Plc’s Ghanaian unit, a
beverage maker in the West African nation, expects pre-tax
profit to increase 30 percent in the current financial year as
the economy expands.  “The Ghanaian economy will be the fastest growing in the
world this year, with growth averaging about 8 percent in the
next five years,” Rob Pilkington, the company’s director of
finance, said at a meeting in the capital, Accra, today. The
beverage industry should grow at a similar rate, enabling
Guinness Ghana to post volume growth of between 9 percent and
9.5 percent a year, he said.  Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd. (GGBL)  reported a profit before tax
of 462,000 cedis ($283,000) for the year ended June 2011,
reversing a loss of 4.4 million cedis the previous year. The
company has already cut financial costs, and plans to use some
of the cash raised through a 70 million-cedi rights offering to
reduce debt.  Guinness Ghana will spend 40 million cedis of that money on
cutting debt and 28.5 million cedis for  capital investment  in
infrastructure, water supply and electricity, Managing Director
Ekwunife Okoli said today.  The company’s shares were unchanged at 1.51 cedis at 2:15
p.m. in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
