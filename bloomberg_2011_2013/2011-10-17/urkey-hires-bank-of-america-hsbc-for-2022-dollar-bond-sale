Turkey asked Bank of America Merrill
Lynch and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  to arrange a sale of dollar-
denominated bond maturing in 2022, according to a statement on
the Ankara-based Treasury’s website today.  The papers may be priced to yield about 3.1 percentage
points, or 310 basis points, over similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries, according to a banker with knowledge of the
transaction. The sale is due to be completed today, the banker
said.  Turkey is reaching out to borrow abroad after announcing a
three-year economic program that sees its  budget deficit 
narrowing from about 1.7 percent of gross domestic product to
1.5 percent next year.  Turkey plans to raise a total of about 12.5 billion liras
($6.8 billion) in foreign borrowing this year, including
payments from international lenders such as the  World Bank . It
sold $1 billion of 30-year bonds on Jan. 5 and $2.3 billion in
yen-denominated 10-year debt on March 11. The Treasury also sold
500 million euros ($689 million) in debt in November last year
that it said was pre-financing for this year.  Turkey’s foreign-currency debt is rated two levels below
investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service, on par with
Jordan and the  Philippines , while  Fitch Ratings  has Turkey one
level below with a positive outlook.  Standard & Poor’s  assigned
an investment-grade ranking to Turkey’s local-currency debt
Sept. 20 while keeping the foreign-currency rating two levels
below.  The government announced on Oct. 13 economic plans aiming
for a tighter budget than the program published last year, with
debt to GDP declining from 39.8 percent at the end of this year
to 35 percent in 2013 and 32 percent in 2014. The previous plan,
which covered the three years to 2013, forecast debt of 36.8
percent at the end of the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
