Virat Kohli struck his seventh one-
day century for  India  as the hosts beat England by eight wickets
in Delhi to take a 2-0 series lead.  Kohli finished unbeaten on 112 from 98 balls as India
reached its victory target with more than 13 of its allotted 50
overs remaining. He was supported in an unbeaten 209-run
partnership by  Gautam Gambhir , who was 84 not out.  Earlier, England was bowled out for 237, with Vinay Kumar
claiming four wickets. Kohli took India to 238-2 as he cracked
his 16th boundary.  India was winless on a tour of England this summer, being
swept in a four-match Test series and also losing a one-day
series 3-0 and a Twenty20 match.  It won the opening match of this five-game series by 126
runs on Oct. 14. The series continues at Mohali on Oct. 20.  The teams are also set to play one Twenty20 international.  To contact the reporter on this story:
