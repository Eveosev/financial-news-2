AirBaltic AS, the unprofitable
Latvian airline, may name Martin Gauss, the former head of
Hungarian airline Malev Zrt, as chief executive officer,  Ir.lv 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The Latvian government and the company’s minority
shareholder, Baltic Aviation Systems, agreed to invest a
combined 107 million lati ($209 million) in the company’s
capital after it posted a loss last year and continued to lose
money this year.  The state owns 52.6 percent of AirBaltic, while Baltic
Aviation Systems has 47.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
