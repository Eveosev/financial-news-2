Markit Group Ltd. has created a loan
index to track the total return of 100 of the most liquid,
dollar-denominated leveraged loans.  Constituents of the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Leveraged Loan
Index are selected from a pool of about 3,000 transactions, the
company said today in a statement. The index will be valued
daily and rebalanced monthly.  Year to date, the debt has lost 2.13 percent, according to
the Markit Liquid Leveraged Loan Index, compared with a gain of
10.97 percent in 2010. Month to date the index has returned 2.06
percent.  “The Markit Liquid LLI provides important insight into the
performance of the most liquid leveraged loans,” Armins Rusis,
global head of data, indices and research at Markit said in the
statement. “This is yet another product from Markit that helps
institutions and investors do business.”  Leveraged loans are ranked below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and less than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
