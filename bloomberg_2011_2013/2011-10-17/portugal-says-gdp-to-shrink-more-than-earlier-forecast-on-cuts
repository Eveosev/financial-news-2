The  Portuguese government 
forecast the economy will contract more than previously
estimated next year as it implements more spending cuts to
meet budget deficit targets.  Gross domestic product will shrink 2.8 percent next
year after a contraction of 1.9 percent this year, the
 Finance Ministry  said in a statement about the 2012 budget
proposal handed to reporters in Lisbon today. The
government had previously forecast the economy would
contract 2.2 percent to 2.3 percent in 2012. The Finance
Ministry estimates the  unemployment rate  will reach 13.4
percent in 2012.  “The options followed in the 2012 budget are
necessary to protect the economy and society against
incalculable risks,” Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said at
a press conference. “The level of economic activity will
recover in 2013 and the unemployment rate will start to
decline.”  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending
and raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro
($107 billion) aid plan from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing
costs surged, Portugal followed Greece and Ireland in April
in seeking a bailout.  Doing More  To meet its budget goals, Portugal has to do more than
it initially planned,Passos Coelho said on Oct. 13. The
overrun in carrying out the 2011 budget, relative to the
financial aid program’s forecast, exceeds 3 billion euros,
he said.  “Portuguese authorities are committed from the start
to taking the additional measures that are necessary to
meet the targets of the aid program,” Gaspar said today.  Portugal  is “on track” to meet its 2011 deficit
goal, a team of EU and IMF inspectors said on Aug. 12. The
IMF said in a Sept. 13 report that the government needs to
improve control over expenditure and cut spending to meet
targets as it seeks to regain access to  bond markets in
2013.  Summer, Christmas Payments  The 2012 budget includes a plan to eliminate the
summer and Christmas salary payments for state workers
earning more than 1,000 euros a month. As mentioned in the
financial aid program,  tax deductions  will be reduced and
the government plans to increase the value-added tax rate
of some goods.  Spending cuts in 2012 represent 4.4 percent of GDP and
revenue increases represent 1.7 percent of GDP, according
to a statement handed in to reporters in Lisbon today.  The austerity measures are intended to help the
government meet its goal of trimming the  budget deficit 
from 9.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.9 percent in 2011, to
4.5 percent in 2012, and to the EU ceiling of 3 percent in
2013. Debt will reach 100.8 percent of GDP this year and
peak at 106.8 percent in 2013 before starting to decline,
the government predicted on Aug. 31. Debt was 93.3 percent
of GDP in 2010.  2011 Forecast  The 2011 forecast for a 1.9 percent GDP decline
compares with a previous prediction for a 2.2 percent drop.
An increase in exports kept GDP unchanged in April through
June from the previous three months, following two
quarterly contractions.  The 2012 budget proposal will be discussed and voted
on in parliament. The coalition government is backed by the
 Social Democrats  and the  People’s Party , which combined
have a majority of seats in the legislature.  The government expects net financing needs of 17.4
billion euros in 2012, 1.3 billion euros less than last
year. Financing needs will include 8 billion euros related
to a capital buffer for the country’s banks, according to
the document of the budget proposal.  Privatizations are expected to raise 4 billion euros
for the state in 2012, the ministry said. The government
next year plans to sell airline TAP - Transportes Aereos
Portugueses SA and airport manager ANA - Aeroportos de
Portugal and the freight branch of CP - Comboios de
Portugal SA and postal operator CTT - Correios de Portugal.  It’s also selling stakes this year in power company
EDP -Energias de Portugal SA and power-grid operator REN -
Redes Energeticas SA.  Portugal won’t need to renegotiate its debt, Gaspar
said in an interview on RTP1 television station. “I
maintain the conviction that we will carry out the bailout
program scrupulously” and that will allow Portugal to
return to markets, Gaspar said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
