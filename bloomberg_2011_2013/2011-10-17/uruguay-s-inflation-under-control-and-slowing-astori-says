Inflation in Uruguay is “under
control” and will slow to target in 2012, Vice President Danilo
Astori said.  “Inflation is under control and the evolution is downward
so we will finish the year slightly above the target range” of 4
percent to 6 percent, Astori told reporters in Montevideo today.
“We are convinced that in 2012 inflation will be on target.”  Uruguay’s consumer prices rose 0.51 percent in September
and 7.79 percent from a year earlier, the national statistics
institute reported on Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
