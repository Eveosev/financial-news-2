Coventry Building Society is selling
at least 500 million euros of three-year covered bonds,
according to a banker involved in the transaction.  The bonds may be priced to yield about 130 basis points
more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, the banker said. Bank of
America Corp., Danske Bank A/S, HSBC Holdings Plc and LBBW are
managing the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
