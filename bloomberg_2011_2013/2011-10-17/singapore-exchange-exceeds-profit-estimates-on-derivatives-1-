Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX)  said first-
quarter profit climbed 18 percent, beating analysts’ estimates,
as increased fees from record derivatives trading helped offset
rising operating costs at the city’s bourse.  Profit rose to S$87.5 million ($69.5 million) in the three
months through September, from S$74.2 million a year earlier,
the company said in a statement today. That beat the average
estimate of S$83.3 million by six analysts compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue increased 12 percent from a year earlier to S$178.4
million, the bourse said. Expenses increased 9.4 percent.  “SGX had record derivatives volumes and continued to see
growing interest for listings and new memberships,” Chief
Executive Officer  Magnus Bocker  said in a statement.  Revenue from derivatives trading at the bourse climbed 26
percent from a year earlier to S$43 million, while those from
securities trading increased to S$72 million, compared with
S$71.3 million, the statement said.  A daily average of S$1.59 billion worth of shares traded on
the exchange in the first quarter, compared with S$1.56 billion
in the same period a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Stocks plunged globally in the last quarter on concern
faltering U.S. economic growth and  Europe ’s worsening sovereign-
debt crisis will derail the global economic recovery.
 Singapore ’s benchmark  Straits Times Index (FSSTI)  slumped 14 percent
during the three months through Sept. 30, the worst quarterly
decline since December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
