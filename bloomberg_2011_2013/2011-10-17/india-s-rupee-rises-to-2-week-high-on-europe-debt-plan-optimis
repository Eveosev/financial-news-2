India ’s rupee rose to the highest
level in more than two weeks on speculation foreign funds will
step up purchases of the nation’s shares after Group of 20
officials endorsed parts of a plan to contain Europe’s crisis.  The currency advanced for a second day after European Union
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said
clarity on a plan to stem the region’s debt problems will emerge
in the “coming days.” Overseas investors bought a net $362
million of Indian stocks last week to Oct. 13, exchange data
show, the biggest increase in holdings since the seven days to
Sept. 2.  “The rupee is benefiting from expectations of inflows into
stocks since the news from  Europe  has helped sentiment,” said
Kamlakar Rao, Mumbai-based head of foreign-exchange trading at
state-run Allahabad Bank.  The rupee gained 0.2 percent to 48.945 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
48.6850 earlier, the highest level since Sept. 28.  G-20 finance ministers and central bank officials reached
some agreement during weekend talks in Paris on how to avoid a
Greek default, bolster banks and curb the contagion. They set an
Oct. 23 summit of European leaders in Brussels as the deadline
for the final plan to delivered.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 49.52 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 49.69 on Oct. 14. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
