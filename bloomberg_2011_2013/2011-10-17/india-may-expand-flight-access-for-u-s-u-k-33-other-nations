India  may consider allowing more
flights from 35 countries including the U.S. and the U.K., Civil
Aviation Minister Vayalar Ravi said in Mumbai today.  The negotiations may include the so-called fifth freedom
rights, he said. Fifth freedom rights allow airlines to take
passengers to a third destination.  As of April last year, Indian carriers were eligible to
sell 711,356 seats per week on flights to and from 104
countries.They utilized only 170,914 seats a week, compared with
326,705 seats by overseas airlines,  official data  showed.  The Indian national auditorâ€™s report on curbing flying
rights of Emirates Airline and other Middle East carriers was
being reviewed by a parliamentary panel, Ravi said. He declined
to comment if India would reduce capacity entitlement to
Emirates in the current round of negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
