Kosovo canceled the sale of  Posta
dhe Telekomunikacioni i Kosoves Sh.A. , the country’s state-owned
telecommunications company, due to a corruption investigation at
the company.  “The government’s commission for the privatization of PTK
has decided to cancel the process and start a new one,” Besim
Beqaj, the Minister for Economic Development, told reporters in
the capital Pristina today.  T-Hrvatski Telekom d.d. of Croatia and  Telekom Austria AG (TKA) 
were chosen in June as the finalists for as much as 75 percent
of the phone company. The Zagreb-based operator, majority owned
by  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , said in July it may back off from the
purchase due to the probe.  The Kosovo government led by Prime Minister Hashim Thaci is
struggling to cut the  budget deficit  and the sale was meant to
cover part of the expenditures.  The predominantly Albanian province that declared
independence from Serbia in 2008 had its financial assistance
from the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union
withheld due to an increase in public-sector wages and a failure
to cut spending, the European Commission said on Oct. 12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
