U.S. workers’ compensation policy
sales plunged 11 percent in 2010 as continued unemployment
depressed demand, A.M. Best Co. said today in a statement.  Policy sales fell to $11 billion from $12.4 billion in 2009
for companies in A.M. Best’s workers’ compensation composite
index. Revenue has decreased for six straight years and is down
48 percent from the 2004 high of $21 billion, the Oldwick, New
Jersey-based insurance-ratings firm said today in a statement.  “Conditions appear to be grim over the near term as the
segment continues to experience a long list of challenges,”
A.M. Best said in the statement. “Underwriting results are
expected to weaken further before they get better.”  Workers’ compensation providers, such as Liberty Mutual
Group Inc. and  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , raised prices
as medical costs increased and the number of claims per worker
went up. Net income for the A.M. Best index increased for the
first time since 2005 as companies earned more on investments.
Net income surged to $1.6 billion last year from about $300
million in 2009, A.M. Best said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
