Global stocks and the euro fell,
retreating after their best weekly gains in more than two years,
as  Germany  damped expectations for a fast resolution to Europe’s
debt crisis and a report showed New York-area manufacturing
shrank more than forecast. Treasuries advanced.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 1.9 percent to
1,200.86 at the 4 p.m. close in New York as  Wells Fargo & Co .
sank after reporting a drop in revenue. The MSCI All-Country
World Index slipped 1.2 percent following last week’s 5.4
percent rally. The euro, which strengthened 3.8 percent versus
the dollar last week, weakened 1.1 percent against the U.S.
currency today. Lead, coffee and gasoline led losses in
materials tracked by the S&P GSCI Index. Treasury 10-year notes
rose, pushing yields down nine basis points to 2.16 percent  Equities and the euro headed lower as Steffen Seibert,
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s chief spokesman, said European
Union leaders won’t provide the quick ending to the debt crisis
that global policy makers are pushing for at an Oct. 23 summit.
Optimism that the region’s officials were developing a plan to
help banks weather losses on sovereign debt propelled gains in
stocks and the euro last week.  “It’s optimism punctuated by reality,” said  Hayes Miller ,
the Boston-based head of  asset allocation  in  North America  at
Baring Asset Management Inc., which oversees $51.6 billion.
“It’s not in the Germans’ interest to offer up a bailout
package on the terms that the market would like.”  Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20
nations concluded weekend talks in Paris by endorsing parts of
 Europe ’s emerging plan to avoid a Greek default, bolster banks
and curb contagion. They set the Oct. 23 meeting of European
leaders in Brussels as the deadline.  Retreat After Weekly Rally  The  S&P 500  fell after last week’s 6 percent surge, its
best gain since July 2009. Wells Fargo slumped 8.4 percent, the
most in more than two months, as the largest U.S. home lender
reported a drop in third-quarter revenue and narrower margins,
even as profit climbed 22 percent to a record $4.06 billion.
Citigroup Inc. fell 1.7 percent, erasing an early rally of as
much as 3.8 percent. Profit at the bank rose 74 percent, beating
analysts’ estimates, following a $1.9 billion accounting gain
that reduced the impact of lower trading and investment-banking
revenue.  Alcoa Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and 3M Co. sank at least
3.8 percent to lead declines in all 30 stocks in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , which tumbled 247.49 points, or 2.1 percent,
to 11,397.  El Paso Corp. (EP)  surged 25 percent, the most in nine
years, as Kinder Morgan Inc. agreed to buy the company for $21.1
billion in a deal that would create the largest U.S. natural-gas
pipeline network.  International Business Machines Corp. lost 3.3 percent in
extended trading after reporting revenue that trailed analyst
estimates.  Trading Range  The S&P 500 is still up 9.3  percent from a 13-month low on
Oct. 3 and ended last week at 1,224.58, above levels where
rallies stopped in August and September. The gauge closed at
1,218.89 on Aug. 31 before dropping 4.4 percent in the next
three sessions, and ended at 1,216.01 on Sept. 16 before losing
7.1 percent by Sept. 22. The index has fluctuated intraday
between a high of 1,230.71 and a low of 1,074.77 since Aug. 5.  The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s general economic
index rose to minus 8.5 from minus 8.8 in September. Economists
projected an improvement to minus 4, based on the median
forecast. Readings less than zero signal companies in the New
York, northern  New Jersey , and southern Connecticut region are
cutting back. A separate report showed U.S. industrial
production advanced 0.2 percent in September on growing demand
for automobiles and computers, matching economists’ estimates.  Commodities, Dollar  Copper fell from a three-week high, slipping 1.9 percent to
$3.3430 a pound in New York. Lead, Brent crude oil, coffee and
gasoline dropped at least 2 percent lead declines in 18 of 24
commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI. The commodities index
slipped 0.8 percent after surging 5.2 percent last week, its
biggest gain of the year.  The euro weakened to $1.3728. The dollar strengthened
against 13 of 16 major peers and the Dollar Index, a gauge of
the currency against six major peers, increased 0.8 percent to
77.237.  The yield on the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond fell 11 basis
points to 3.13 percent.  The cost to protect U.S. bank debt climbed. Credit-default
swaps on Wells Fargo, based in  San Francisco , added 7 basis
points to 152 basis points at 11 a.m. in New York, according to
data provider CMA. Those tied to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
climbed 22.5 basis points to 361. A benchmark gauge of U.S.
corporate credit risk also rose.  European Equities  About seven stocks declined for each that gained in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, which retreated 1 percent after gaining
for three straight weeks. Automobile companies led losses, with
Daimler AG and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG down more than 3
percent. BP Plc appreciated 2.2 percent after saying Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. will pay $4 billion to settle all claims over
last year’s oil spill in the  Gulf of Mexico .  Benchmark German 10-year bunds rose, sending their yields
down 10 basis points to 2.098 percent. The yield on 10-year
French debt widened to a record 95.6 basis points above German
bunds.  Ten-year Spanish bond yields advanced for a sixth day,
adding seven basis points to 5.32 percent.  The yield on the Portuguese 10-year security rose 14 basis
points to 11.79 percent, with seven days of losses in the bond
driving the level up from 11.21 percent.  Emerging Markets  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index increased 0.1 percent for a
ninth straight gain, the longest winning streak in 16 months.
The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of Chinese shares traded
in  Hong Kong  climbed 2.8 percent and the  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  jumped 1.6
percent in Seoul.  South Korea ’s won climbed against all 16 major
peers.  South Korean Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said at the
Paris meeting the Asian nation’s economy is performing better
than expected, while data tomorrow may show China’s gross
domestic product increased 9.3 percent in the third quarter from
a year earlier, according to the median estimate of 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the ninth
consecutive quarter of expansion above 9 percent.  A U.S. Senate vote to punish China for depressing its
currency is the latest legislative ritual in which the message
may be as important as the proposed sanction. U.S. House Speaker
 John Boehner  practically declared the measure dead on arrival in
the Republican-run chamber after the Senate’s 63-35 vote last
week to let U.S. manufacturers seek duties on Chinese imports if
they prove they were harmed by manipulation of the yuan.
Boehner, of  Ohio , voiced “grave concerns” the measure may
trigger a trade war.  To contact the reporters on this story:
