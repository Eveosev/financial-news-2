Sunpreme, a closely held solar-cell
manufacturer, received $50 million in financing that will be
used to build a factory in Jiaxing,  China .  The investment was led by International Finance Corp., a
unit of the World Bank Group, and also included participation
from Capricorn Investment Group LLC and a fund managed by
Beijing-based Tsing Capital, Sunpreme said in an e-mailed
statement.  The factory will annually produce 30 megawatts of silicon-
based cells using the company’s proprietary low-cost
manufacturing process and is expected to enter operation by the
end of the year, Jeff Lettes, a spokesman for the Sunnyvale,
California-based company, said in a telephone interview.  Capricorn led Sunpreme’s prior first round of funding,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
