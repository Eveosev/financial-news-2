South African stocks reversed gains
and the rand weakened against the dollar after German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s spokesman said  Europe ’s leaders won’t provide a
quick resolution to the region’s debt crisis.  The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index lost 0.3 percent to
31,028.18 by 1:32 p.m. in Johannesburg after earlier trading as
much as 1.1 percent stronger. The currency of Africa’s biggest
economy weakened 0.9 percent to 7.9013 per dollar, making it the
second-worst performer among 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg after Norway’s krone.  Merkel has made it clear that “dreams that are taking hold
again now that with this package everything will be solved and
everything will be over on Monday won’t be able to be
fulfilled,” Steffen Seibert, her chief spokesman, said at a
briefing in Berlin today. The search for an end to the crisis
“surely extends well into next year.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
