The  Federal Reserve  approved a final
rule implementing the Dodd-Frank Act’s requirement that the
largest bank holding companies design a plan in the event of
their own bankruptcy.  The so-called living wills must “describe the company’s
strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy during
times of financial distress,” the Fed said today in a statement
in  Washington .  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. board voted unanimously
on Sept. 13 to release a joint final rule laying out what the
largest and most complex financial firms must include in living
wills.  Congress, in the Dodd-Frank Act, expanded regulators’
authority to seize and unwind lenders in response to the market
tumult that followed the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The new rules are designed to eliminate
the need for bailouts by giving the FDIC power to liquidate
large firms whose failure could threaten the financial system.  The largest U.S. banks, including Citigroup Inc.,  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Bank of America Corp., will have to develop
annual strategic plans that describe the specific actions the
companies would have to take in resolution. The plans must also
describe the company’s organizational structure and its
interconnections to other firms, according to the Fed.  Companies will submit their plans on a staggered basis, the
Fed said. Those with over $250 billion in assets will generally
be required to submit plans by July 1, 2012 with smaller banks
having a longer time frame.  To contact the reporter on this story:
