Makhteshim-Agan Industries Ltd. (MAIN) 
completed its merger with China National Chemical Corp. today
and its shares were delisted from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
 Koor Industries Ltd. (KOR) , which sold its Makhteshim stake, soared.  ChemChina’s acquisition of control of Makhteshim from Koor
took effect after the Israel registrar of companies listed the
deal and the European antitrust regulator approved it.  ChemChina said it agreed to buy the Makhteshim stake on
Dec. 28 under an agreement that valued the world’s largest maker
of generic agrochemicals at $2.4 billion.  Koor advanced 2.8 percent to 43.70 shekels at 10:50 a.m. in
Tel Aviv trading, headed for its highest close since Aug. 4. IDB
Holding Corp., Koor’s parent company, gained 1.5 percent to
58.70 shekels, poised to finish trading at the highest since
Sept. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
