Carlyle Group , the Washington-based
private equity firm, expects to buy a minority stake in a food-
processing company in Saudi Arabia before the end of the year,
its managing director for the Gulf region said.  Speaking at the Super Return Middle East 2011 in Dubai
today, Carlyle’s Firas Nasir declined to identify the company.  Both of Carlyle’s investment in the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council have been in Saudi Arabia, “because there
is a clear path to exit” through initial public offerings in
the country, Nasir said at the conference. Saudi Arabia is
Carlyle’s “primary market” in the Gulf because its larger
population allows companies to grow and you “can very easily
help these companies expand across the GCC,” he said.  Carlyle raised $500 million for its first Middle East and
North Africa fund in March 2009 after seeking as much as twice
that amount. The company bought a 30 percent stake in General
Lighting Co.,  Saudi Arabia ’s biggest lighting-fixtures
manufacturer, in 2010 without disclosing its price.  “Our call is to do a deal a year,” Nasir said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
