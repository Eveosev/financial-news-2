European Central Bank  governing
council member  Christian Noyer  said it may be difficult to
increase the size of Europe’s financial support fund, though the
possibility of leveraging it should be studied.  “It would be unrealistic to expect an increase in the EFSF
itself,” he told a conference in Paris, refering to the
European Financial Stability Facility. “I am personally open to
any scheme which would allow existing commitments to be
leveraged to provide greater intervention capacity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
