L’Oreal SA (OR) , the world’s largest
cosmetics company, rose as much as 3.4 percent in Paris trading
after a judge ruled that heiress Liliane Bettencourt is mentally
unfit to manage her own affairs and appointed her daughter to
act on her behalf.  Bettencourt, whose family owns about 31 percent of L’Oreal,
will seek a suspension of the ruling, Jean-Rene Farthouat, her
lawyer, said today.  L’Oreal shares gained as much as 2.67 euros to 81.17 euros
and were up 2.1 percent at 80.14 euros as of 11 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
