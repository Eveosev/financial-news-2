Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets at midyear, said it has $32.4 billion in
funded and unfunded exposure in France and  Belgium  before so-
called hedges.  Of $14.4 billion in funded transactions, meaning the bank
has already provided money, it has obtained collateral, margin
agreements or credit protection covering all but $2 billion as
of Sept. 30, it said today in a  presentation  on its website. The
$18 billion in unfunded exposure includes $12.4 billion in
commitments to companies, $4.2 billion to financial firms and
$1.4 billion to sovereign entities.  Citigroup, led by Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit , is
giving shareholders more information about business in Europe as
investors try to gauge potential fallout from a debt crisis
centered on  Greece , Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain -- known
as the GIIPS. The bank, which tumbled 38 percent during the
third quarter, rose 0.7 percent to $28.59 as of 10:21 a.m. today
in New York after reporting a $3.77 billion quarterly profit
that beat analysts’ estimates.  Credit protection was purchased from “high quality
financial institutions predominantly outside” the seven
European countries, New York-based Citigroup said. The firms are
mainly in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, Chief Financial Officer
 John Gerspach  said on a conference call with journalists today,
declining to identify any of the companies.  Gross funds at risk in five other European countries fell
during the third quarter to $29.8 billion from $31.7 billion on
June 30, today’s presentation shows. At the end of September,
funded exposure in the GIIPS countries amounted to $20.6
billion, while unfunded commitments were $9.2 billion, the bank
said. It had $13.5 billion in collateral, margin agreements or
credit protection for the funded transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
