Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , Canada’s third-
largest bank, has been expanding its  fixed-income  operations in
New York and London, Scotia Capital co-Chief Executive Officer
Mike Durland said.  Fixed income will be one of the main growth initiatives to
drive future revenue, Durland said today at an analyst
 conference  in Toronto. The lender will also expand its prime
brokerage, energy and derivatives businesses, he said.  The moves are “designed to increase our diversification,”
Durland said.  The investment-bank unit derived 19 percent of revenue this
year from fixed income, up from 7 percent in 2001. At the same
time, the lender has reduced its reliance on corporate banking
revenue.  Scotia Capital typically accounts for 30 percent of
Toronto-based Scotiabank’s overall profit. The lender recorded
net income of C$4.24 billion ($4.18 billion) in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
