Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest
cocoa producer, plans to impose a purchase limit on exporters as
part of industry reforms designed to boost output, according to
a draft government plan.  “To avoid any dominant market position abuses a purchase
limit will be imposed on authorized exporters,” a group set up
by the agriculture ministry said in the plan, which was obtained
by Bloomberg. The plan didn’t give further details and is yet to
be publicly released. No one answered calls made to the Abidjan-
based ministry today.  The West African nation’s reforms also plan to set up a
pre-selling system with 70 percent to 80 percent of the annual
output sold before the start of each season, the document
showed. As much as 70 percent of the sales will be undertaken by
exporters and the remainder by a state-controlled industry
manager that will be established, according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
