The U.S.  Justice Department  denied
that a third weapon tied to a program that put illegal U.S. guns
in the hands of Mexican criminals was recovered at the scene
where border patrol agent Brian Terry was killed last year.  “The FBI has made clear that reports of a third gun
recovered from the perpetrators at the scene of Agent Terry’s
murder are false,” said  Tracy Schmaler , a Justice Department
spokeswoman, in an e-mail statement today.  U.S. Representative  Darrell Issa , chairman of the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said there was
evidence of a possible third weapon during an appearance
yesterday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” program.  Issa, a California Republican, has led the congressional
investigation into the law enforcement program called Operation
Fast and Furious that allowed illegal U.S. gun purchases in an
effort to link the weapons to Mexican drug cartels.  Two of about 2,000 guns that the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed to be carried away were
found at the scene of Terry’s December 2010 murder in  Arizona .  During his “Face the Nation” appearance, Issa said the
two recovered weapons were numbered “two” and “three” during
the subsequent FBI investigation and “there’s no ‘one.’”  “I’m not accusing anyone of a criminal cover-up, but we
have a real obligation to follow this,” Issa said.  Schmaler said the third item was a blood sample from Terry
rather than a firearm. “For this reason, it was not listed on
the ballistics report prepared by the FBI,” Schmaler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
