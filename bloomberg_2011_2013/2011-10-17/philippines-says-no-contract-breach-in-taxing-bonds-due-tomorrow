Philippine Tax Commissioner  Kim
Henares  said a 2004 Bureau of Internal Revenue ruling
“superseded” a 2001 decision that so-called PEACe bonds sold
then were subject to regular income tax and not the 20 percent
final tax.  “We can issue a  tax refund  to anyone who had paid income
taxes on the PEACe bonds,” Henares said in a phone interview.
“There was no breach of contract and we’re not changing rules
mid way. A ruling has been issued since 2004 and the bonds were
never tax exempt to begin with.”  Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCB)  said it had asked the Court
of Tax Appeals to review the government decision that 35 billion
pesos of PEACe bonds due Oct. 18 will be subject to a 20 percent
tax. The bonds weren’t subject to a withholding tax, according
to a term sheet distributed to investors when the zero-coupon
bonds were sold in 2001.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
