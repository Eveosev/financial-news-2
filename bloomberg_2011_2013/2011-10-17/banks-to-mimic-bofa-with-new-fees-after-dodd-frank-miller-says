U.S. banks likely will charge
customers more fees as the lenders seek to recoup revenue sapped
by new U.S. rules, said  Paul Miller  of FBR Capital Markets Corp.  Banks may levy added fees and cut expenses as regulations
erode former sources of “really strong fee revenues,” such as
overdraft charges, Miller said today in an interview with Pimm Fox and Courtney Donohoe on Bloomberg Radio’s “Taking Stock.”  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  are among
lenders that have announced plans to charge customers for using
 debit cards  after the  Federal Reserve , acting on a mandate of
the Dodd-Frank Act, capped the so-called swipe fees charged to
merchants. The caps may trim annual revenue at the biggest U.S.
banks by $8 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg Government show.  “Banks will try to do something to recuperate some of
those fees,” said Miller, a former examiner with the  Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia . “They won’t recuperate all of
them, but they’ll try to get some of them back.”  Bank of America’s plan to charge customers $5 a month
sparked objections from critics including President  Barack Obama , and five U.S. House Democrats asked Attorney General Eric Holder on Oct. 13 to investigate whether banks and their trade
groups colluded on decisions to impose new fees. San Francisco-
based Wells Fargo ended all debit-reward programs and is testing
a $3 monthly fee in some markets.  “Those debit cards now are not that profitable unless
they’re able to collect some of those fees back from
consumers,” Miller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
