Tanzania’s inflation rate rose for
an eleventh month to 16.8 percent in September as food and
energy costs climbed, the country’s statistics office said.  Inflation accelerated from 14.1 percent a month earlier,
the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement handed to
reporters today in  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital. Prices
rose 2.4 percent in the month, it said.  Food prices climbed 21.3 percent in September from a year
earlier compared with 17.4 percent in August and energy costs
advanced 33.1 percent, the agency said.  Inflation in  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy may slow
to 9 percent by June as a decline in international  oil prices 
reduces imported fuel costs, Joseph Masawe, director of economic
research and policy at the Bank of Tanzania, said in an
interview on Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
