The Bank of Canada’s new five-year
mandate will include the introduction of so-called flexible
inflation targets that provide stable growth to the economy, the
Globe and Mail reported.  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney and Finance Minister
 Jim Flaherty  are set to acknowledge that a narrow focus on
fighting inflation isn’t enough, the newspaper said. The federal
government is set to renew the central bank’s mandate by the end
of the year, the Globe reported.  The flexible targets allow the bank to take longer than
usual to bring inflation to the central bank’s 2 percent target,
the paper said, relying on “public comments” made by Carney in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
