Former European Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti said  Germany  must be convinced that
joint euro bonds would be a better source of funding than debt
purchases by the  European Central Bank .  “We need to convince Germany that euro bonds are a better
option than having member states increase their funding of the
ECB so that it can afford to buy more and more bonds of all
countries in difficulty,” Monti said in a speech in Rome today.  Referring to  Europe ’s rescue fund, the European Financial
Stability Facility, he also said that there may not be enough
“ammunition” to deal with Italy or  Spain  should either fall
victim to Europe’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
