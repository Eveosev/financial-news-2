Chile ’s central bank and government
have monetary and fiscal instruments to respond if growth
moderates faster than forecast amid concern over the European
debt crisis, bank board member Rodrigo Vergara said.  “Chile isn’t immune to the external financial events, but
it has the tools to mitigate possible impacts,” Vergara said
during a speech in Santiago today. “The possibility of extreme
scenarios is not low, but today is outside our base scenario.”  The $200 billion economy is starting to see growth slow to
rates approaching its 5 percent long-term trend, Vergara said.
Gross domestic product will expand as much as 6.75 percent in
2011 after recovering from last year’s 8.8-magnitude earthquake
and the 2009 recession, moderating to a range of 4.25 percent to
5.25 percent in 2012, he said.  Chilean borrowing costs of 5.25 percent are consistent with
keeping inflation around the central bank target of 3 percent,
he said. The central bank in August changed from a
“restrictive” to a “neutral” bias by omitting language on
raising rates and is willing to take additional steps if the
outlook deteriorates, he said.  Policy makers will reduce the benchmark rate to 5 percent
in December after keeping it on hold for a fifth straight month
in November, according to the median estimate of 60 economists
in an Oct. 11 central bank survey. The bank will cut borrowing
costs to 4.75 percent by March and 4.5 percent by September,
which would be its lowest level since April 2011, according to
the poll.  The peso weakened 0.9 percent to 504.05 per dollar at 12:00
p.m. New York time from 499.76 on Oct. 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
