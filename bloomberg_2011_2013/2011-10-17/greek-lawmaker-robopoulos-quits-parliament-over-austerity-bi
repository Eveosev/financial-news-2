Greek ruling party lawmaker Thomas
Robopoulos submitted his resignation today, surrendering his
seat ahead of a Parliament vote on austerity measures, according
to a statement posted on Robopoulos’s website.   His resignation means Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will
be able to replace Robopoulos with another member of the ruling
party, leaving Papandreou’s majority of 154 seats in the 300-
seat Chamber unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
