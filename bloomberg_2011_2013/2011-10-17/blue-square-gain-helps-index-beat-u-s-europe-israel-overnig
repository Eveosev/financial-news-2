Alon Holdings Blue Square Israel
Ltd. and  Elbit Systems Ltd. (ESLT)  gained in the U.S. on prospects for
increased revenue, helping Israeli companies traded in  New York 
to outperform stocks in  Europe  and the U.S. Israel’s TA-25 index
declined today.  Blue Square, Israel’s second-largest supermarket chain,
rose to the highest level in two weeks yesterday after workers
at its biggest competitor demanded talks on  job security .  Elbit
Systems Ltd. (ESLT) , the country’s biggest non-government defense
company, rose yesterday after winning a $15 million contract to
supply an Asian government agency with technology systems. The
TA-25, the country’s benchmark, fell 0.5 percent at the 2:45
p.m. close in  Tel Aviv  today.  The Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index of the largest Israeli
companies traded in New York slipped 0.1 percent yesterday to
85.42, outperforming the  S&P 500 Index (SPX) ’s 1.9 percent plunge and
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s 1 percent retreat. Israeli
companies in the U.S. are trading at 8.2 times estimated
earnings, below the 8.4 multiple on the TA-25 index and the
S&P’s 9.8 level, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This is a market with low risks and very comfortable
valuation levels,” Eyal Dabby, the head of equity research at
Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd., said about Israeli stocks in an
interview yesterday with Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg
Television’s “The Pulse” program in  London .  The TA-25 Index surged the most since 2009 on Oct. 16 after
Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers concluded
weekend talks in Paris endorsing parts of a plan to avoid a
Greek default, bolster banks and curb contagion.  Blue Square  Shares of Rosh Ha’Ayin, Israel-based Blue Square rose 2
percent to 21.42 shekels, or the equivalent of $5.86 in Tel Aviv
today, the highest level since Sept. 21. The U.S. stock jumped
6.1 percent to $5.74 yesterday.  The country’s Histadrut labor federation called for
immediate negotiations on job security measures for employees at
 Shufersal Ltd. (SAE) , Israel’s largest supermarket chain, following an
agreement to sell control of the retail chain.  Discount Investment Corp. has agreed to sell its 46 percent
stake in Shufersal for 2.42 billion shekels ($662 million) to
Isralom Properties Ltd. and  England ’s Noe family.  Shufersal’s profit would likely be hurt by a management
shake-up, said Guil Bashan, an analyst at I.B.I.-Israel
Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  “If Shufersal is facing problems with its workers, then
the first one to benefit from it would be Blue Square,” said
Gilad Alper, an analyst at Excellence Investments House in  Ramat
Gan , Israel.  Elbit, Teva  Elbit declined 1.7 percent to 158.30 shekels, or the
equivalent of $43.36. The U.S. shares increased 0.3 percent to

provided to the Asian government within 18 months, Elbit said
yesterday in a statement, without providing further details on
the purchaser.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , the world’s largest
maker of generic drugs, slipped 0.1 percent to 143.90 shekels,
or the equivalent of $39.41. The U.S. shares gained 0.3 percent
to $39.29 yesterday.  After trading closed in the U.S. yesterday, an advisory
panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted 17-0 that
there wasn’t “compelling evidence” that 1-2 milligram doses of
the drugmaker’s Azilect treatment slowed progression of
Parkinson’s disease.  The shekel dropped 0.5 percent to 3.6552 per  U.S. dollar  at
4:48 p.m. in Tel Aviv. Israeli technology companies raised $569
million in capital during the second quarter, the most in two
years, up from $343 million in the same period last year,
according to the  Israel  Venture Capital-KPMG Quarterly Survey
released July 13.  Partner Communications  Israel, whose population of 7.7 million is similar to
 Switzerland ’s, has about 60 companies traded on the Nasdaq stock
market, the most of any country outside the U.S. after  China . It
is also home to the largest number of startup companies per
capita in the world.  The nation’s stock market was upgraded to developed market
status by MSCI Inc. in May 2010, the same month the 63-year-old
country was accepted to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation.  Partner Communications Ltd., the second-largest mobile-
phone operator, lost 0.5 percent to 41.77 shekels, or $11.46.
The U.S. shares climbed 0.4 percent to $11.29, the highest level
in two months yesterday.  The company’s controlling shareholder is in talks to sell
15 percent of its 45.5 percent stake in the company, newspaper
Globes reported on Oct. 16 after the market closed.  Scailex Corp., which has a controlling stake in Partner,

of unpaid vacation as the global economic slowdown reduced
demand for its products, Globes reported yesterday, citing a
letter sent to the workers by the company.  An e-mailed message to Hanna Yonai, a Tower spokeswoman,
wasn’t returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
