Barton Biggs , the hedge fund manager
who bought stocks when the market bottomed in March 2009,
boosted bullish bets on equities in his Traxis Global Equity
Macro Fund on improving U.S. economic data.  The fund’s net long position rose to 65 percent from 40
percent about a month ago, according to Biggs, the founder of
Traxis Partners LP, in an interview with Betty Liu on Bloomberg
Television’s “In the Loop” program. Biggs said on Sept. 22
that bullish bets at all Traxis funds had fallen to 20 percent.  U.S. stocks have recovered from the brink of a  bear market 
amid optimism European leaders will take action this month to
solve the region’s debt crisis. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
surged 6 percent between Oct. 7 and Oct. 14, the biggest weekly
rally since July 2009.  “I’m inclined to stay where I am, which is moderately,
cowardly bullish,” Biggs said. “The thing that makes me want
to hang in there is that the high frequency economic news from
the U.S. has definitely improved. It’s gotten pretty good.”  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S. turned
positive last week for the first time since April 29, the day
the  S&P 500  peaked at an almost three-year high. It climbed to
2.2 on Oct. 14, up from minus 117.20 on June 3. The reading four
months ago showed reports were missing the median economist
projection in Bloomberg surveys by the most since January 2009.  The S&P 500 fell 1.9 percent to 1,200.86 today as financial
shares slumped and the German government damped optimism of a
quick fix to  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Biggs predicted on Aug. 18 that the S&P 500 may be
bottoming after an 18 percent drop between April 29 and Aug. 8.
Last month, he said bets that stocks will gain made up 20
percent of holdings at Traxis, down from as much as 85 percent
six months prior, as the threat of a recession makes equities
too risky.  “I wish I was minus 20,” he said during a Sept. 22
interview on Bloomberg Television. Markets were indicating
policy makers have to change or the economy will slip into a
double-dip recession and stocks will plunge another 20 percent,
he said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
