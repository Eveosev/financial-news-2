Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , part-owner
of one of the biggest-ever African oil discoveries, plans to
relocate an offshore rig from Ghana to drill off the coast of
Mozambique.  The $576,000 a day that Anadarko is paying to lease the
Deepwater Millennium rig may be affected by the change of locale,
owner Transocean said in a monthly fleet-status report published
today on its website.  John Christiansen , a spokesman for The
Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko, identified Mozambique as the
destination during a telephone interview today.  Anadarko has the Deepwater Millennium under lease through
July 2013, according to Transocean’s  fleet report . The 12-year-
old vessel can operate in seas 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) deep
and is capable of drilling 30,000 feet below the sea surface.  Anadarko owns a stake in the Jubilee field off the coast of
 Ghana , a field the company estimates holds the equivalent of 1.5
billion barrels of crude. Other offshore Ghana discoveries in
which Anadarko is a partner include Enyenra and Tweneboa.  Transocean, based in Vernier,  Switzerland , is the world’s
largest operator of offshore drilling rigs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
