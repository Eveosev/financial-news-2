Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) ,
 India ’s largest software exporter, posted second-quarter profit
that missed analysts’ estimates as a weaker-than-expected
economic recovery made customers hold back technology spending.  Net income rose 15 percent to 24.4 billion rupees ($498
million) in the three months ended Sept. 30, Mumbai-based Tata
Consultancy said in a statement today. Profit was projected at
25.2 billion rupees according to the median of 28 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer N. Chandrasekaran said there was a
lot of “negativism” among clients amid economic uncertainty.
His counterpart at rival Infosys Ltd., S.D. Shibulal, last week
said customers were delaying decisions on projects. The recovery
in the U.S. still faces what Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
economist  Chris Rupkey  calls “a lot of headwinds” from the
sovereign-debt crisis in the  euro zone  to political gridlock
over the budget of the world’s largest economy.  “IT spending reacts with a lag to macroeconomic headwinds
and tailwinds, and to that extent we will see slightly weaker
demand starting the next quarter,” said Hitesh Shah, vice
president of research at IDFC Securities Ltd. in Mumbai.  Tata Consultancy declined 1.2 percent to 1,120.25 rupees at
close in Mumbai trading before the earnings announcement, while
the benchmark Sensitive Index slid 0.3 percent. The stock has
climbed 14 percent in the past 12 months, outperforming the
Sensex’s 16 percent fall. Infosys, India’s second-largest
software company, has lost 12 percent.  Europe  ‘Worrisome’  Revenue rose 25 percent to 116.3 billion rupees, from 92.9
billion rupees a year earlier. The median of 35 analysts’
estimates was 117 billion rupees.  The macroeconomic situation in Europe is “worrisome,”
Chandrasekaran said at a briefing in Mumbai today. Still, “we
are getting positive vibes from customers in terms of their IT
spends going forward,” he said.  Tata Consultancy, which provides computer services and back
office support to companies including  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
Volkswagen AG,  derived  52.9 percent of its first-quarter revenue
from companies in  North America , 15.3 percent from the U.K., and
9.9 percent from continental Europe.  ‘Not as Bright’  Worldwide spending on technology goods and services by
businesses and governments, which includes computer equipment
and outsourcing, will grow 5.5 percent in 2012 to $2.15
trillion, slowing from an estimated 11.5 percent this year,
according to a Sept. 16 report from Forrester Research Inc.  The outlook for demand in 2012 is “not as bright,” as
weak economic growth in the U.S. and Europe will make business
and governments more cautious about investing in technology,
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Forrester said.  U.S. gross domestic product is projected to expand 2
percent in 2012 from a 1.7 percent pace this year, according to
the median of 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News from Oct.
5 to Oct. 11.  Tata Consultancy added 35 clients during the quarter, for a
total of 1,010 active customers. The company had a 6.2 percent
increase in volume in the three months ended Sept. 30 from the
previous period. Volume at Infosys grew 4.5 percent, Chief
Financial Officer V. Balakrishnan said Oct. 12.  Information-technology services companies define volume as
the number of man-months workers spend on projects for clients.  Infosys shares rose the most in more than two years in
Mumbai on Oct. 12, after the Bangalore-based software-services
provider raised its full-year sales guidance and posted earnings
that beat analyst expectations for the first time in a year.
Infosys projected sales in the year to March to range between
335 billion rupees and 340.9 billion rupees.  Attrition Declines  Tata Consultancy added a net 12,580 employees during the
quarter, for a total of 214,770, according to the statement.  Workers left Tata Consultancy at a rate of 13.7 percent in
the quarter ended Sept. 30, a decrease from 14.1 percent for the
same period last year. Infosys reported employee attrition of
15.6 percent for the period.  As software vendors compete to win and retain the best
workers, wages across the industry are rising, creating a new
source of pressure on profit margins. Tata Consultancy said in
April that it would raise salaries for its workers in India by
12 percent to 14 percent in the year ending March 31, while
Infosys said it would raise wages by 10 percent to 12 percent.  The  Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQK) , the country’s second-biggest
lender, today said it signed a 5-year agreement with Tata
Consultancy for outsourcing back office and information
technology services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
