Chinese stocks will extend recent
rallies as inflation may have peaked and excessive pessimism and
capitulation may signal a bottom for equity markets, according
to China International Capital Corp.  The nation’s slumping money supply growth figure is an
“incomplete measure” given the “continued disintermediation”
of the banking system, Hao Hong, CICC’s Beijing-based global
equity strategist, said in a report to clients. “If we include
the growth in financial management products, inter-bank
deposits, non-financial companies’ reserve deposits, and forex
deposits in the calculation of monetary aggregate, money supply
growth has indeed been well over 20 percent in recent months.”
M2 rose 13 percent last month, the least in almost a decade.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
