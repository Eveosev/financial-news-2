Slovakia sold 211.5 million euros
($294 million) of zero-coupon three-year  government bonds  in the
first auction of state securities after the government
collapsed.  The securities were sold at an average yield of 2.6789
percent, down from 2.9762 percent at the previous auction of the
same securities on July 11, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based Debt
and Liquidity Management Agency said said on its Bloomberg page.  Slovakia is facing early elections on March 10 after the
Cabinet of Iveta Radicova lost a confidence motion tied to a
vote on enhancing the European bailout mechanism. The collapse
jeopardizes the eastern euro zone member’s fiscal targets and
it’s negative for its  credit rating , Moody’s Investors Service
said in a note earlier today.  The auction, which represented a second re-opening of an
issue first sold in April, attracted bids of 247.5 million
euros, the government agency said. The minimum and maximum
yields accepted today were 2.557 percent and 2.7473 percent,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
