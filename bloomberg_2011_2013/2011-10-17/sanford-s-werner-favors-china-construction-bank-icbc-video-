Mike Werner, a bank analyst at 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in Hong Kong, talks about the Chinese
banking industry.  China’s state-run Central Huijin Investment started buying
shares in the nation’s four biggest banks on Oct. 10 and plans 
to continue with "related market operations," according to a 
statement on its website. Werner speaks in Hong Kong with 
Rishaad Salamat on Bloomberg Television's "On the Move Asia."
