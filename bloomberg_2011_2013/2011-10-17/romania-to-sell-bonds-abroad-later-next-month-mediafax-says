Romania plans to sell bonds in
either the U.S. or  Europe  in the second half of November,
Mediafax reported, citing Deputy Finance Minister Bogdan Dragoi.  “Right now the U.S. looks more interesting because of the
volume and the preference for longer maturities,” the newswire
in Bucharest quoted him as saying. “But considering the market
conditions, we will decide where we issue the bonds once we have
the documents ready.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
