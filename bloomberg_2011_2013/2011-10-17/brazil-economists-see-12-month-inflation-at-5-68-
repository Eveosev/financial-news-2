Economists covering  Brazil  raised
their 2012 inflation forecast for a seventh week as a tight
labor market, predictions of further interest rate cuts and an
improved outlook for a global recovery stoked expectations of
faster price rises.  Consumer prices will increase 5.61 percent next year,
according to the median forecast in an Oct. 14  central bank
survey  of about 100 economists published today, up from a
forecast of 5.59 percent the previous week. Economists also
raised their 2013 inflation forecast to 4.9 percent from 4.85
percent.  “Inflation dynamics are getting worse,” said Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in
Sao Paulo. “The labor market has been driving this situation.
We see the  unemployment rate  below its natural level and,
despite that, the central bank is cutting  interest rates .”  An improved international scenario over the last two weeks
has also worsened the inflation outlook, Serrano said.  The economists surveyed expect the central bank to cut
borrowing costs half a point to 11.5 percent at their policy
meeting this week, the survey found, after central bank
President Alexandre Tombini said that “moderate” rate cuts
could protect Brazil from global turbulence. August retail sales
and economic activity figures data published last week showed
the economy slowing faster than economists had expected.  Interest Rate Futures  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell 3 basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 10.52 percent at 8:01 a.m.
New York time. The real weakened 0.6 percent to 1.7435 per
dollar.  Consumer prices, as measured by the IPCA index, will rise
6.52 percent this year, unchanged from last week’s forecast, the
survey found.  Latin America ’s biggest economy will grow 3.42 percent this
year, down from a forecast of 3.50 percent the previous week,
the survey found. Analysts also cut their 2012 growth forecast
to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent.  Tombini surprised analysts Aug. 31 by slashing the
benchmark Selic rate 50 basis points to 12 percent, citing a
“substantial deterioration” in the global outlook. Analysts
expect policy makers to cut the Selic to 11 percent by the end
of the year, and to 10.5 percent by the end of 2012, the survey
found.  Inflation accelerated for a 13th straight month in
September, to 7.31 percent. The central bank targets inflation
of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Unemployment fell to 6 percent in August, a record low for
the month, down from 6.7 percent a year earlier.  The economic activity index, a proxy for gross domestic
product, contracted 0.53 percent in August from the previous
month, its biggest monthly fall since the global financial
crisis of 2008. August retail sales fell the most since March
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
