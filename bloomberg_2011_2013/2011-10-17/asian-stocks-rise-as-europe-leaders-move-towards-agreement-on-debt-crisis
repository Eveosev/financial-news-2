Asian stocks rose, extending the
biggest weekly gain since March on the region’s benchmark index,
after Group of 20 finance chiefs meeting in Paris endorsed parts
of a plan to contain Europe’s debt crisis.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company,
advanced 2.1 percent in Sydney. National  Australia  Bank Ltd.,
the nation’s biggest business lender, climbed 1.9 percent.
 Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that gets 83 percent of its
revenue in Europe, surged 7.9 percent in  Hong Kong .  Sony Corp. (6758) 
rose 5 percent after profit at its Sony Ericsson Mobile
Communications AB venture beat analyst estimates.  Olympus Corp. (7733) 
tumbled 24 percent after an auditor report recommended
investigating payments made to agents during an acquisition.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.9 percent to 119.04
as of 7:57 p.m. in  Tokyo . About five stocks rose for each that
fell. The gauge climbed 3.4 percent last week after German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
pledged to deliver a plan to recapitalize  Europe ’s banks and
address  Greece ’s debt crisis.  “An important precondition for resolving the European
credit crisis is unity of vision and commitment to find a
solution,” said  Angus Gluskie , who manages more than $300
million at White Funds Management in Sydney. “The comments over
the weekend show some elements of both. A credible and well-
executed solution is the next element, and we are yet to see
this.”  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 1.5 percent and
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 1.7 percent. South Korea’s
Kospi Index increased 1.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
advanced 2 percent while Shanghai’s Composite Index added 0.4
percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1
percent after climbing as much as 0.9 percent today. The gauge
rose 1.7 percent in  New York  on Oct. 14 after a report showed
retail sales rose more than economists estimated. The  S&P 500 
had its biggest weekly gain since July 2009 amid rising
confidence that European policy makers are moving toward taming
the region’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Retail Sales  Retail sales in the U.S. rose more than forecast in
September, easing concern that slumping confidence and scant
hiring will derail the biggest part of the economy.  Separately, G-20 finance ministers and central bankers
concluded weekend talks in Paris, endorsing parts of an emerging
plan to avoid a Greek default, bolster banks and curb contagion.
They set an Oct. 23 summit of European leaders in Brussels as
the deadline for it to be delivered.  Hurdles to overcome for an accord include resistance from
bankers to a deeper restructuring of Greek debt as well as
disagreements between Europe’s capitals over just how to
multiply the firepower of their bailout fund and recapitalize
financial institutions.  ‘Risk Appetite’  “We could see that G-20 countries would cooperate with
European countries, which helped concern over the debt crisis
recede,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at
Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Investors are recovering
their risk appetite.”  Commodity and consumer stocks led advances among the Asian
benchmark’s 10 industry groups. BHP Billiton rallied 2.1 percent
to A$37.65 in Sydney, while rival Rio Tinto Group added 2.4
percent to A$69.95. S-Oil Corp., South Korea’s third-largest
crude refiner, surged 8.9 percent to 110,500 won in Seoul, and
Korea Zinc Co., which also produces gold and silver, advanced
2.5 percent to 323,000 won.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , a Japanese commodities trading company,
surged 3.5 percent to 1,615 yen. Cnooc Ltd. rose 3.3 percent to
HK$13.72 in Hong Kong after the state-run Xinhua News Agency
said the company finished cleaning up an oil spill in  China ’s
Bohai Bay, prompting the government to lift its emergency
response to earlier leakages.  Copper, Oil  New York-traded copper futures rose 3.1 percent on Oct. 14,
while the London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six metals
including copper and aluminum advanced 2.1 percent. Crude oil
futures in New York gained 3.1 percent. Oil and copper futures
climbed again today.  Esprit surged 7.9 percent to HK$12.52 in Hong Kong, leading
Asia’s exporters higher. Sony rose 5 percent to 1,607 yen after
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB posted third-quarter
sales and pretax profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates as
sales climbed in Asia.  Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 80 percent of
its sales overseas, gained 2.1 percent to 728 yen. Rival Honda
Motor Co. added 3.6 percent to 2,329 yen.  James Hardie
Industries SE (JHX) , a building-materials supplier that gets more than
70 percent of its sales from the U.S, climbed 2 percent to
A$5.70 in Sydney.  Asian financial shares also climbed. National Australia
Bank gained 1.9 percent to A$24.75 and Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, the nation’s largest by market value, climbed 1.9
percent to A$48.38 in Sydney.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s

jumped 3.4 percent to 301 yen.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)  advanced 1.8 percent to
341 yen after its Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Co. joint
venture said it plans to quadruple job cuts in Japan after the
number of staff who accepted early retirement offers exceeded
the brokerage’s initial estimate.  Estimated Earnings  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index dropped 15 percent this year
through Oct. 14, compared with a 2.6 percent loss by the S&P 500
and a 14 percent decline by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.3 times for the S&P 500
and 10.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  Among stocks that fell today, Olympus plunged 24 percent to
1,555 yen in Tokyo. At least six brokerages cut their ratings on
the optical-equipment maker after Michael C. Woodford was
dismissed as president on Oct. 14 amid a row with the board over
fees paid during the 2008 purchase of Gyrus Group Plc.  “It is important that Olympus take appropriate steps to
fully investigate and understand the acquisition of Gyrus and
the arrangements made,” auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers
recommended in its report, commissioned by Woodford and obtained
by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
