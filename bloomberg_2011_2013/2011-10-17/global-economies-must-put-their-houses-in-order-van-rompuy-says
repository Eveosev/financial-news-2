European Union President  Herman Van
Rompuy  said economies around the globe must work together to
solve the debt crisis while at the same time putting their “own
houses in order.”  “We must adopt a comprehensive approach,”  Van Rompuy  said
today in a statement after meeting with labor and employer
leaders in Brussels. “The European Union is not alone in
experiencing growth problems,” he said.   “Our major global actors are confronted either with high
government deficits and sluggish structural economic growth, or
with inflation and a counter-inflationary policy,” Van Rompuy
said. “We all have to put our own houses in order and also work
together.”  In the  Europe , “we shall have to join forces to avoid a
very strong growth lag and pursue a policy to stabilize the euro
area,” he said. “We must therefore ensure that the inevitable
budget restructuring is as growth- and job-friendly as
possible.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
