The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission may increase risk of manipulation and volatility in
markets for oil, gas and other commodities unless new
speculation limits apply similar treatment to physical-settled
and cash-settled derivatives, Senator Maria Cantwell said.  Cantwell, a Washington Democrat who supports so-called
position limits, made the comment in an Oct. 14 letter to CFTC
Chairman  Gary Gensler , whose agency is scheduled to vote on
Dodd-Frank Act rules to impose the restrictions at a meeting in
Washington tomorrow.  In a January proposal, the CFTC supported conditional
position limits that would allow larger positions in cash
derivatives markets. Chicago-based  CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s
biggest futures exchange, objected to the plan’s different
treatment of the physical-delivered  derivatives market , which it
dominates, and the cash-settled market primarily controlled by
Atlanta-based  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)   The January proposal would set limits on derivatives
trading based on the market for an underlying commodity such as
oil. A trader could hold a position as much as 125 percent of
the size of the estimated deliverable supply, as long as the
derivatives were cash-settled and the trader controlled no more
than 25 percent of the physical market. The limit wouldn’t be as
generous for traders with positions in both cash-settled and
physical-delivered derivatives.  The CFTC may change the rule to narrow differences between
the two markets, Bloomberg News reported on Sept. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
