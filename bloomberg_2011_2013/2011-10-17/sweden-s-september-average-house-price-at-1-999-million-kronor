Swedish house price gains eased in
September, giving the central bank more scope to scale back its
monetary tightening plans and adapt policy to the fallout of
 Europe ’s deepening debt crisis.  House prices rose 1 percent in the three months through
September both from the previous quarter and from a year
earlier, Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  said in a statement
on its website today. The average price of a one- or two-
dwelling building was 2.05 million kronor ($311,639) last
quarter, the office said.  Sweden’s Riksbank shelved a cycle of seven rate increases
last month, citing a flare-up in global market turmoil and
deteriorating recovery prospects in Europe and the U.S. The bank
had previously signaled it would need to continue raising
interest rates to ward off credit-driven imbalances in the
 property market . Policy makers have since also scaled back
planned rate increases for next year.  “There shouldn’t be any drastic fall” in  house prices ,
Riksbank Deputy Governor Barbro Wickman-Parak told reporters on
Oct. 14. “That’s not what we’re counting on.”  The krona gained 0.2 percent against the euro to trade at
0.1314 as of 10:32 a.m. in  Stockholm . Versus the dollar, the
krona rose 0.3 percent to 6.5739.  To contact the reporter on this story:
