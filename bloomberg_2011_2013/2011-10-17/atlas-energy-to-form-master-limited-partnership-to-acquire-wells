Atlas Energy LP, the natural-gas
explorer that sold Pennsylvania prospects to Chevron Corp.
earlier this year, will separate its exploration and production
business, helping it to acquire wells from other producers.  The new entity, to be known as Atlas Resource Partners LP,
will be a master-limited partnership, a corporate structure that
allows unitholders to share in profits through quarterly
distributions, Moon Township, Pennsylvania-based Atlas Energy
said in a statement today.  The separation “will enable Atlas Resource Partners to
expand cash flows from its natural-gas and oil production assets
through strategic acquisitions and organic development,” the
company said.  Atlas will distribute units representing about 19.6 percent
interest in the exploration and production unit to its
shareholders. It will hold about 78.4 percent of the unit and
own the general partner.  The unit will hold assets in Appalachia, the Niobrara
formation in  Colorado  and shale properties in Michigan, Indiana
and  Tennessee .  Citigroup Inc. is the lead financial adviser and Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen & Katz is the legal adviser, Atlas Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
