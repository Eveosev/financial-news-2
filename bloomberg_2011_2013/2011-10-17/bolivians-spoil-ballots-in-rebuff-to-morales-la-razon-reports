Bolivian President  Evo Morales 
suffered a setback yesterday when many Bolivians spoiled or left
their ballots blank in the first elections for the country’s top
judges,  La Razon  reported.  According to a preliminary report by polling company Ipsos
Apoyo, 39 percent of the votes cast were valid, while 45 percent
were spoiled, the La Paz-based newspaper said.  Opposition parties had called on people to spoil their
ballots, saying the selection process left members of Morales’
party, the Movement Toward Socialism, with the majority of
candidates, La Razon reported.  The state election authority has said that official results
will take days or weeks to be announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
