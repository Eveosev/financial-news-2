Former Belgian Prime Minister Guy
Verhofstadt urged a European approach to recapitalizing banks in
order to restore confidence in Europe’s banking industry.  “We obviously need a European approach,” Verhofstadt said
today in a Bloomberg Television interview. Policy makers should
“create the same rules and the same environment for all banks
in Europe, smaller and bigger banks. That is necessary to create
confidence between the financial institutions in Europe,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
