Mouchel Plc rose the most on record
in London trading as the U.K. provider of road maintenance
services said its lending banks remained “fully supportive” of
the board, even after its interim chairman resigned.  Mouchel climbed 44 percent to close at 18.75 pence in
London trading, the biggest gain since the shares started
trading in 2002. This gives the Surrey, U.K.-based company a
market value of 21.1 million pounds ($33 million).  Interim chairman David Sugden resigned after taking the
post last week, the company said in an e-mailed statement late
yesterday. The stock fell to a record low on Oct. 13 as the
company made top management changes and said it expects to
breach banking covenants after an accounting error erased 4.3
million pounds of profit.  “The shares have been absolutely hammered in the week
before that, so there’s going to be an element of relief
bounce,” Andy Brown, a London-based analyst at Panmure Gordon
said in a telephone interview. “Assuming the banks don’t want
to pull the plug on it at the moment, then you’ll see a lot of
volatility in its price the next few weeks,” said Brown, who
has a “hold” recommendation on the stock.  “On the basis that every time they’ve opened their mouth
recently they’ve had a profit warning, it’s a very uncertain
outlook,’ he said. “This is a high-risk play at the moment for
anybody.”  Mouchel said last week it was delaying reporting of the
full-year results until Nov. 30 to allow accounting firm KPMG
LLP to prepare a review of the accounts for lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
