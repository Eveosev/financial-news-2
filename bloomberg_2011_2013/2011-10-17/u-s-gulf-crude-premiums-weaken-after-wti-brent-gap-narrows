The premiums for U.S. Gulf Coast
oils weakened as West Texas Intermediate crude’s discount to
Brent oil narrowed on speculation that there won’t be a quick
end to the European debt crisis.  The gap between WTI and Brent December contracts weakened
$1.69 to $23.54 a barrel based on settlement prices on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  and the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The spread for prompt month contracts settled at a
record $27.88 a barrel Oct. 14.  Brent fell as Steffen Seibert, German  Chancellor Angela
Merkel ’s chief spokesman, said European Union leaders won’t
provide the speedy conclusion to the debt crisis that policy
makers are pushing for at an Oct. 23 summit.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed 90 cents to
$27.60 a barrel while Light Louisiana Sweet lost 90 cents to
$27.50 above the U.S. benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend decreased $1.50 to $23.25 a barrel and Poseidon lost 90
cents to $23.10 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium weakened 75 cents to $23.25
a barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount was steady at 70 cents a
barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium decreased $1.15 to $25.25 above
the benchmark.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 60 cents a
barrel to $10.15 below the price for WTI.  Syncrude’s premium to WTI was unchanged at $8.80 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
