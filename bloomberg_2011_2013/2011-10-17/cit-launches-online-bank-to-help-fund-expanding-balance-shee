CIT Group Inc. (CIT) , the commercial
lender run by John A. Thain, said it opened its online consumer
bank to help diversify its funding sources.  CIT Bank will offer certificates of deposits through the
Internet, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
In 2012, CIT Bank may also offer checking, savings, online bill
pay and mobile banking, according to the statement.  CIT is reversing its strategy of shrinking the balance
sheet after exiting bankruptcy almost two years ago. The lender
will look to use Internet deposits to help fund its asset
growth, Thain said last month.  “The online bank will help us meet the financing needs of
our small-business and middle-market clients,” Thain said today
in the statement. “The launch of CIT Bank online is another
important step in our efforts to diversify our funding sources
into stable, low-cost deposit products.”  CIT will “likely at some point” acquire branches to help
fund its asset growth, Thain said in September. Regulators
encourage deposit gathering at brick-and-mortar locations, he
said at the time. The development of Internet deposit-taking is
also a “significant positive” for regulators, he said.  CIT is still required to submit to tighter supervision by
the Federal Reserve Bank if  New York , which signed a written
agreement with the lender in August 2009.  Editor: Dan Kraut  To contact the reporter on this story:
