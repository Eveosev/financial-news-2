Super Retail Group Ltd. (SUL) , an
Australian owner of camping and auto-parts stores, agreed to pay
A$610 million ($630 million) for Rebel Group as it expands into
sporting goods.  The acquisition of Australia’s largest sporting-goods
retailer from buyout firm  Archer Capital  will be funded with
debt as well as cash from A$334 million of new stock Super
Retail plans to sell through an entitlement issue, the Brisbane-
based company said in a filing today. The new shares will be
sold at A$5.34 apiece, an 18 percent discount to the closing
price on Oct. 14.  Australia’s largest retail acquisition since 2008 will add
128 stores with annual revenue of A$603 million under the Rebel,
Amart and Performance Sports  brands  to bolster sales in
 Australia ’s leisure market. Super Retail paid about 7.9 times
profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization,
compared with the 9.4 times median of 18 acquisitions of
retailers in Australia over the past five years, according to
Bloomberg data.  “The multiple is pretty good for Super Retail and it’s a
business that will fit them nicely,” said Peter Esho, chief
market analyst at Sydney-based City Index Australia Pty. “They
are picking up a premium brand at a time when discretionary
retail has been pretty soft.”  Super Retail trading was suspended on the Australian Stock
Exchange today. The shares have gained 6.7 percent this year,
compared with a 9.9 percent drop on the benchmark S&P/ASX 200
Index.  Camping, Auto Stores  Super Retail owns  stores  including Supercheap Auto, Ray’s
Outdoors, Goldcross Cycles and BCF which sells boating, camping
and fishing equipment.  Rebel had ebitda of A$77 million last year and will
increase Super Retail’s earnings-per-share in the 12 months
ending June 2012, according to the statement. The chain says it
has about 24 percent of the Australian sporting goods market.  The deal is conditional on the entitlement offer being
completed.  Archer acquired Rebel Sport Ltd. in March 2007 for A$369
million and then combined it with its existing Amart Allsports
business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
