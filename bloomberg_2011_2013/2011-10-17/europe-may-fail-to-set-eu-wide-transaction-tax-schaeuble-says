German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said he’s “not quite sure” that the European Union
will agree to tax financial transactions across the EU.  “Pressure is increasing” to impose such a levy, and other
regions will follow if  Europe  leads the way, Schaeuble said in
remarks at  Chatham House  in  London  today. Global protests
against the financial industry show that a transaction tax can
foster “peace,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
