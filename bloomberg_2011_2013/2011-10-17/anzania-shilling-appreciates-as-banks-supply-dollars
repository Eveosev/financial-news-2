Tanzania’s shilling appreciated
against the dollar as commercial banks sold the U.S. currency.  The currency of East Africa’s second-biggest economy gained
as much as 0.6 percent at 1,685.5, and traded up 0.4 percent at
1,688.7 per dollar by 12 p.m. in  Dar es Salaam , the commercial
capital.  “Some commercial banks have been offloading dollars they
bought last week from the market,” Alex Ngusaru, head treasurer
at Cooperative Rural Development Bank Plc, said by phone today
from Dar es Salaam. “There was a lot of supply of dollars from
coffee and tobacco exporters last week.”  Tanzania is Africa’s fourth-largest producer of coffee
after Ethiopia, Uganda and the Ivory Coast, according to the
 International Coffee Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
