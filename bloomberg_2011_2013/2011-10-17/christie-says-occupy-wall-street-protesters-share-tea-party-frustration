New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie 
compared the Occupy Wall Street protest to the Tea Party
movement, saying the frustrations at the root of both stem from
the same government “dysfunction.”  “We ought to listen to these people,” Christie said today
during a meeting with employees at Kearfott Corp. in Little

they angry? Because government has become dysfunctional.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
