Gilts fell for a second day after
Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers endorsed parts
of a plan to resolve the euro-area’s sovereign debt crisis,
curbing demand for safer assets.  The pound approached a one-month high versus the dollar
after an industry report showed London home sellers raised
asking prices by the most in two years in October. G-20
officials set an Oct. 23 summit of European leaders as the
deadline for a package of measures to be delivered. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 both rose 1.3 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.64 percent at 9:24 a.m. London time. The
3.75 percent security due September 2021 fell 0.285, or 2.85
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,582) face amount, to 109.625. The
two-year rate rose one basis point to 0.63 percent.  U.K. government debt has returned 10 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, surpassing the 5.9
percent gain for German bunds and 3.1 percent for French debt.  The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.5838, after
strengthening 1.7 percent last week. It reached $1.5853 on Oct.
14, the strongest since Sept. 15. Sterling was little changed at
87.80 pence per euro.  The U.K. currency has declined 1.2 percent in the past six
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which measure a basket of 10 developed-market currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
