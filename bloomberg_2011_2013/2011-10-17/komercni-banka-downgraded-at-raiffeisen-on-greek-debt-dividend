Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  was downgraded to
“hold” from “buy” at Raiffeisen Research, which said the
Czech unit of  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA is likely to take more losses
on Greek government bonds and reduce its dividend.  Raiffeisen lowered its price estimate for Komercni shares
to 3,750 koruna ($210.27) from 3,800 koruna and cut the
projected dividend to 200 koruna from 230 koruna, according to a
report today from analyst Stefan Maxian in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
