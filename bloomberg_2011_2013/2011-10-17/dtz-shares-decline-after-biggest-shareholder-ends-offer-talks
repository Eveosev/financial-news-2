DTZ Holdings Plc (DTZ)  fell the most since
December 2008 in London trading after its biggest shareholder
ended talks about a possible offer for the unprofitable U.K.
real estate broker.  DTZ fell 16 percent to 23 pence, reducing the company’s
market value to 62 million euros ($98 million).  France ’s Mathy
family-owned Saint George Participations SAS won’t proceed with
a bid for the shares it doesn’t already own, according to a
statement today. SGP is backed by the property brokerage arm of
Paris-based bank  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA.  “The external environment has contrived to prevent the
considerable efforts of many people over the past months to
consummate a transaction,” DTZ Chairman Tim Melville-Ross said
in a separate statement. William Bain, associate director at
Hawkpoint, SGP’s financial adviser, declined to comment.  SGP owns 54 percent of DTZ, which is cutting staff costs
and other expenses after reporting losses for the past four
years. The company announced today that SGP and Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc provided a loan facility of as much as 10 million
pounds, replacing a mezzanine facility.  “By the change in senior management we were able to being
to take out some heavy cost at the center of the business,” DTZ
Chief Executive Officer John Forrester said today in a telephone
interview.  DTZ set an Oct. 17 deadline for a formal offer last month.
The London-based company’s shares have dropped 48 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
