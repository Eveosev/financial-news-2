Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s largest oil
company, and  Providence Resources Plc (PVR)  are among energy companies
that won 13 exploration licenses off the Irish coast.  A Repsol unit won a 40 percent stake in a license to
explore the Goban Spur Basin, off Ireland’s southwest coast,
with Providence and Sosina Exploration Ltd.  Irish Energy Minister Pat Rabbitte announced the winners in
an auction of oil and gas exploration licenses today in Dublin.
It may be possible that larger  oil companies  could become
involved in the exploration process, depending on initial
results, he said.  ‘You have a pattern of the giants coming in at a particular
juncture of the process,” Rabbitte told reporters. “If we have
significant resources out there, and we hope we have, it would
transform the position of the country in terms of  energy
security .”  The ministry received 15 applications of interest in
licenses to explore the country’s Atlantic shelf.  Other companies to win a full or partial licenses include
Serica Energy U.K. Ltd., Chrysaor E&P Ireland Ltd., Bluestack
Energy Ltd., Antrim Energy Ltd., Europa Oil & Gas (Holdings)
Plc., Two Seas Oil & Gas, First Oil Expro Ltd., San Leon Energy
Plc and Petrel Resources Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
