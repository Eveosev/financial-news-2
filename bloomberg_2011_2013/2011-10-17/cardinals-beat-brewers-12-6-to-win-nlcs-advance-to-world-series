The  St. Louis  Cardinals scored nine
runs over the first three innings to beat the Milwaukee Brewers
12-6 and advance to Major League Baseball’s  World Series .  Albert Pujols, Rafael Furcal and David Freese hit home runs
for the Cardinals, who won the best-of-seven National League
Championship Series 4-2. The teams combined for six home runs in
Game 6 at Miller Park in Milwaukee.  The Cardinals return to the World Series for the 18th time
in franchise history and will face the  Texas Rangers  in the
best-of-seven series that starts Oct. 19 in St. Louis. The
American League-champion Rangers lost to the  San Francisco
Giants  in the World Series last year, while the Cardinals are
back for the first time since winning the 2006 title.  The Cardinals jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the top of the
first inning against a  Milwaukee  team that had the best home
record in baseball this season. Lance Berkman had a run-scoring
single and Freese followed with a three-run homer off Brewers
starting pitcher Shaun Marcum.  While Corey Hart, Rickie Weeks and Jonathan Lucroy hit home
runs over the first two innings to pull the Brewers within 5-4,
the Cardinals added four more runs in the third inning off
Milwaukee’s Chris Narveson.  Freese and Matt Holliday each scored three runs for the
Cardinals, whose six-run win comes a day after the Rangers
clinched back-to-back pennants with a 15-5 rout of the Detroit
Tigers in Game 6 of the ALCS.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
