Yuan non-deliverable forwards rose
the most in a week as European leaders made progress on a plan
to solve the region’s debt crisis, bolstering confidence before
a report tomorrow on  China ’s third-quarter economic growth.  The onshore yuan rate also strengthened as gross domestic
product probably increased 9.3 percent from a year earlier,
according to the median estimate of 22 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. That would be the ninth straight quarter of
expansion above 9 percent and follows a 9.5 percent gain in the
previous three months. The People’s Bank of China set the
 reference rate  stronger for the first time in four days.  “NDFs have been boosted by risk appetite as investors hope
a solution to the European crisis will be announced soon,” said
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB. “A firmer fixing confirms that China continues to
want its currency to appreciate.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.36 percent to
6.3790 per dollar as of 4:31 p.m. in  Hong Kong , a 0.13 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yuan gained 0.12 percent to close at 6.3706 in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency is allowed to fluctuate 0.5 percent on either side
of the fixing rate, which was set at 6.3710 today.  Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank officials
reached some agreement during weekend talks in Paris on how to
avoid a Greek default, bolster banks and curb the contagion.
They set an Oct. 23 summit of European leaders in Brussels as
the deadline for the final plan to delivered.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan advanced 0.25
percent to 6.4260, a 0.9 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
