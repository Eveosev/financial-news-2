Greek government spokesman Elias
Mosialos said parliamentary approval of the government’s
austerity bill would be “definitive” for the country’s
negotiating position in talks with European Union partners on a
second financing package.  The rejection of any article in the bill “creates
difficulties,” Mosialos told reporters in  Athens  today. He said
Cabinet today discussed the situation regarding strikes by
unions opposed to the bill, which is expected to be voted on on
Oct. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
