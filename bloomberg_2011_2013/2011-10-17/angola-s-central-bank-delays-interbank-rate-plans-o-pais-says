Angola ’s central bank delayed plans
to introduce an average interbank lending rate to next month, O
Pais reported, citing Fernando Joao Fonseca, vice president of
Banco Keve, a commercial lender in the southern African nation.  Banco Nacional de Angola, as the central bank is known,
will in November introduce a 30-day Luanda Interbank Offered
Rate, or Luibor, and in January start a 6-, 9- and 12-month
Luibor, the newspaper cited Fonseca as saying.  A spokesperson for the bank declined to immediately comment
when reached by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
