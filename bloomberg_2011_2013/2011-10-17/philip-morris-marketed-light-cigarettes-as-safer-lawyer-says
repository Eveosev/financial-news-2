Altria Group Inc. (MO) ’s  Philip Morris 
unit deceived Missouri consumers by marketing Marlboro Lights as
safer than regular cigarettes, a lawyer said at the end of
trial.  “Philip Morris made two promises -- to provide lower tar
and nicotine to smokers,” Stephen Swedlow, who represents
Missouri smokers suing the company, said today in state court in
 St. Louis . “They did not deliver on this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
