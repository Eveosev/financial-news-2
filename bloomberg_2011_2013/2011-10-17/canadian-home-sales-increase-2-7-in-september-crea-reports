Canadian existing home sales last
month posted their biggest increase since January, the  Canadian
Real Estate Association  said, led by gains in Toronto and
Montreal.  Seasonally adjusted home sales increased to 38,377 units
during September from 37,326 units in August, the organization
said in a statement today. Purchases rose 11.0 percent from a
year earlier, down from a 15.8 percent annual pace in August.  While Canada’s real estate market has been strong since
2009, with buyers taking advantage of historically low  interest
rates  and available credit from banks, the market slowed earlier
this year after Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  tightened mortgage
rules earlier and rising prices made home purchases less
affordable.  “The report still reinforces the general theme of a soft
landing in the housing market,” Mazen Issa,  Canada  macro
strategist for TD Securities Inc. in Toronto, said in a note to
investors.  Home sales in Toronto rose 5.2 percent in September, and
increased 2 percent in Montreal. The average sale price for a
Canadian home gained 0.3 percent in September to a seasonally
adjusted C$357,942 ($351,900).  To contact the reporter on this story:
