DLA Piper , the world’s second-
largest law firm, lost restructuring specialist H. Jeffrey Schwartz to Brown Rudnick, a midsize firm that specializes in
servicing hedge, venture and private-equity funds.  Schwartz is joining Brown Rudnick’s New York office, the
firm said in a statement today.  Schwartz was with DLA Piper since May 2009 after leaving
Dechert LLP, where he built a national bankruptcy practice. He
has been recognized by  Chambers USA , which ranks lawyers and law
firms, as a leader in bankruptcy and restructuring litigation.
He is the former chairman of DLA Piper’s restructuring group.  “At Brown Rudnick we have top-tier bankruptcy litigators
here and I am looking forward to helping create a top-tier
bankruptcy transactional practice as a core practice area,”
Schwartz said in a phone interview.  “Jeff is a world-class restructuring lawyer whose addition
increases the breadth of our insolvency practice and strengthens
the firm’s brand as an international powerhouse,” Brown Rudnick
Chief Executive Officer Joseph F. Ryan said in the statement.  The bankruptcy and corporate restructuring group that
Schwartz will work with recently represented the Bank of
Ireland, Six Flags Inc., Visteon Corp., Tribune Corp.,
Washington Mutual Inc. and American Safety Razor Co., according
to the statement.  Brown Rudnick has 200 lawyers, according to its website.
DLA Piper has 4,200 lawyers, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
