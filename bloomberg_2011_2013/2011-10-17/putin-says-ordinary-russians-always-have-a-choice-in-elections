Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , who is seeking to return to the presidency next year,
said that ordinary citizens “always have a choice” in deciding
on their leaders.  Putin, 59, who has been in power since 2000 and could stay
as president for another 12 years, said he wants his ruling
United  Russia  party to keep its dominant role in the country.  “United Russia should stay the leading force in the
country and the State Duma,” Putin said in a preview of an
interview to be broadcast in full on three Russian state
channels later today. In elections, “for the ordinary citizen,
there is always a choice,” he added, according to the excerpt
aired on Rossiya-24.  Putin said on Sept. 24 he’ll run for the presidency in
March elections, pushing aside his protege,  Dmitry Medvedev , who
replaced him in the Kremlin for four years because of a
constitutional ban on three consecutive presidential terms.  Two more six-year terms would give Putin 24 years at the
helm in Russia, making him the longest-serving leader since the
Soviet Union’s  Josef Stalin .  Russia holds parliamentary elections on Dec. 4, followed by
a presidential vote in March.  Putin said last week his decision to seek to retake the
country’s number one job next year will strengthen Russia’s
political system.  “The decision that we took with Medvedev is absolutely
right and won’t weaken but will strengthen the system of
government in Russia,” Putin said in an interview with Chinese
state media in Beijing during a trip to  China . “We are counting
on the support of the electorate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
