Nigeria ’s naira strengthened at a
foreign-currency auction after the central bank’s supply of
dollars exceeded the amount demanded by lenders.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  offered $400 million and sold
$297 million, outpacing demand for the first time since June 29.
The marginal rate, which is used as the prevailing exchange
rate, strengthened 0.1 percent to 149.94 per dollar, compared
with 150 naira at the previous sale, the Abuja-based bank said
in e-mailed statement.  “Anytime the central bank exceeds dollar demand, naira is
bound to appreciate,” Usman Onoja, chief executive officer of
Lagos-based Lovonus Trust and Investment Ltd., which trades in
currencies, said by phone.  A central bank policy restricting some companies from
obtaining dollars at the twice-weekly auction added pressure on
the naira’s interbank rate, Onoja said. The currency weakened as
much as 2.7 percent to 164.8 per dollar, before paring the loss
to 162.63 naira as of 5:57 p.m. in Lagos, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
