Munich Re aims for a full-year
profit, Chief Financial Officer Joerg Schneider said at a
conference in Berlin today, reiterating the company’s forecast.  The reinsurer would like to keep its dividend “stable”
for the current year, Schneider said, adding that it is still
too early to give a forecast. Munich Re will book a further
writedown on its Greek bond holdings in the third quarter, he
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
