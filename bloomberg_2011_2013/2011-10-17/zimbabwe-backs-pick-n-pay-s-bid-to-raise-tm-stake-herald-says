 The Zimbabwean government has
approved South African retail company  Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) ’s
proposal to raise its stake in TM Supermarkets to 49 percent
from 25 percent, the Herald reported, citing Empowerment and
Indigenization Minister  Saviour Kasukuwere .  Pick n Pay will invest $21 million in the Zimbabwean
grocer, the Harare-based newspaper said, citing Kasukuwere. The
investment will increase competition in the retail sector,
Kasukuwere was quoted as saying.  The Zimbabwean government has demanded that all foreign-
owned companies submit plans to sell stakes in local assets for
official approval or risk losing their right to operate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
