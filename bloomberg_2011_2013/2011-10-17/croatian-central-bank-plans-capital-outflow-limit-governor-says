Croatian  central bank  Governor
Zeljko Rohatinski said steps are being taken to prevent foreign
banks from withdrawing excessive capital from local
subsidiaries.  Should the debt crisis in the euro area worsen and foreign
banks try to use capital from its Croatian units, the central
bank will respond with “prepared measures,” Rohatinski told
 state TV  late yesterday.  Croatia ’s two biggest banks are subsidiaries of Italian
financial companies. Zagrebacka Banka d.d., the country’s
biggest lender by market value, is owned by  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , while
Privredna Banka d.d. is a unit of  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)   Rohatinski also said Croatia needs to turn to domestic
sources of financing as capital inflows from abroad are expected
to decrease as the crisis in euro-region continues.  “For this we need painful cuts,” Rohatinski said,
Measures “have been overdue since 2008, but in this country
there was not enough courage and strength to execute them.”  Croatia, which is preparing to become the  European Union’s 
28th member in July 2013, is still struggling to recover from a
two-year recession. The economy expanded 0.8 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, after a 0.8 percent
contraction in the first three months. Foreign direct investment
totaled $6 billion in 2008, the last pre-crisis year, before
declining to $583 million in 2010.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
