Portugal ’s Banco BPI revised down
its 2011 growth forecast for Angola’s economy, citing weak
government spending and lower oil production.  Growth in Africa’s second-biggest oil producer after
Nigeria is expected to reach 2.5 percent this year, down from
6.3 percent forecast by BPI in May, the bank said in a  report on
its website .  Oil production in Angola should average 1.54 million
barrels a day in 2011 compared with 1.73 million barrels last
year. Lower oil output should “in part” be compensated by
higher oil prices, BPI said.  BPI, which controls Angolan bank Banco de Fomento Angola,
expects the Southern African nation’s economy to grow by 9.8
percent in 2012 as oil production rises and new  oil fields  start
producing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
