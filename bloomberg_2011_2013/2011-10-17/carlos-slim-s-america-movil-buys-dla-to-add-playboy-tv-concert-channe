America Movil  SAB, the phone carrier
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , agreed to buy DLA Inc.,
adding video-on-demand programming and Latin America cable-TV
channels including Playboy TV and the Concert Channel.  America Movil and  Claxson Interactive Group Inc. (XSONF) , DLA’s
current owner, expect to complete the transaction in the fourth
quarter after gaining regulatory approval, according to a filing
today to Mexico’s stock exchange. Mexico City-based America
Movil didn’t disclose financial terms.  Slim is venturing into video programming after becoming the
biggest pay-TV provider in Latin America through a series of
acquisitions over the past decade. America Movil had 11.6
million pay-TV subscribers at the end of June, with cable and
satellite systems in countries including Brazil, Chile and Peru.  Closely held Claxson is based in Buenos Aires. Its DLA unit
has a collection of sports, music and adult entertainment
channels, and it offers digital distribution over pay-TV
networks, Internet and mobile devices for Hollywood studios,
according to its  website .  America Movil slid 1.9 percent to 15.5 pesos at the close
of trading in  Mexico  City. The shares have dropped 13 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
