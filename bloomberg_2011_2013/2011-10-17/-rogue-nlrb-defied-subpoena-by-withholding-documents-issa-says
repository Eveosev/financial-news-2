The  National Labor Relations Board ’s
acting general counsel, Lafe Solomon, broke the law by
intentionally withholding documents about  Boeing Co. (BA) ,
Representative Darrel Issa said.  “Your continued personal obstruction, lack of compliance
with a validly issued congressional subpoena and false
statements to the committee are unacceptable,” Issa said today
in a letter to Solomon. “The NLRB is acting as a rogue agency
that believes it does not have to fully answer to Congress.”  Issa, a California Republican and chairman of the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee, requested that six
NLRB employees submit to transcribed interviews for his
investigative panel.  The NLRB’s complaint against Boeing in April said the
airplane maker violated  labor laws  by deciding to build a 787
Dreamliner plant in  South Carolina  in retaliation for union
strikes in Washington state, home to Boeing’s factories. NLRB
spokeswoman Nancy Cleeland didn’t immediately respond to a
request for comment on Issa’s letter. Boeing has denied it acted
to punish the union.  Issa asked Solomon to let committee staff interview the
acting deputy general counsel, associate general counsel, a
trial lawyer, the special counsel for congressional and
intergovernmental affairs, a regional director and Cleeland.  To contact the reporters on this story:
