Inflation in  Bangladesh  accelerated
to the fastest pace in nearly 13 years on higher food costs,
adding pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates .  Consumer prices rose 11.97 percent in September from a year
earlier, after gaining 11.29 percent the previous month, the
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics said in a statement today. Food
inflation quickened to 13.8 percent in September from 12.7
percent in the previous month. Prices have jumped the most since
December 1998, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Accelerating inflation could stymie the government’s plan
to boost economic growth to a record 8 percent in the South
Asian nation and erode incomes in a country where the  Asian
Development Bank  estimates more than half of the 166 million
people live on less than $1.25 a day.  Bangladesh’s central bank has raised interest rates five
times in 13 months to tame the inflation rate, which is the
highest in  Asia  after Vietnam. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina aims
to slow consumer-price increases to 7.5 percent in the financial
year ending June 30 from 8.8 percent a year earlier.  The central bank, which has raised interest rates by 275
basis points since August last year, said on July 27 it plans to
persist with a policy of restraining credit growth in the
current fiscal year even as meeting the government’s inflation
goal may be challenging.  Bangladesh plans to import 600,000 metric tons of wheat in
the next nine months for various state-run welfare programs,
Badrul Hasan, director for procurement at the Directorate
General of Food, said on Sept 16. Global food prices rose 16
percent in September from a year earlier, according to the
 United Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
