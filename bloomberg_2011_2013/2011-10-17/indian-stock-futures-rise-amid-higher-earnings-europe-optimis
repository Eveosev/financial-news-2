Indian stocks declined, led by
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  after the September quarter profit at
the nation’s most valuable company was little changed from the
previous three months.  Reliance tumbled the most in three weeks.  Tata Consultancy
Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software maker, paced losses among
peers before its earnings today.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, climbed to its highest level in more than two
months after global sales rose 24 percent last month.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, dropped 57.60, or
0.3 percent, to 17,025.09 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The
measure gained 5.2 percent last week, the most since the period
ended Sept. 2, as Infosys Ltd., the second-biggest software
exporter, reported profit that beat forecast.  “Investors are watching the earnings season closely for a
clear cut direction,” said Kaushik Dani, a Mumbai-based  fund
manager  at Peerless Mutual Fund, which manages $1.2 billion in
assets. “Global factors have stabilized for the past few days
and it’s time to access the impact of macro numbers on company
earnings.”  The Sensex has declined 15 percent this year amid concern
interest-rate increases to curb price increases may compound the
effects of Europe’s debt crisis and slowing economic growth in
the U.S. on corporate profits. Earnings for 47 percent of Sensex
companies missed analyst estimates in the three months ended
June, according to Bloomberg data. That compares with 33 percent
that lagged behind forecasts in the previous quarter.  Europe Plan  Asian stocks rose today, extending the biggest weekly gain
since March on the region’s benchmark index, after Group of 20
finance chiefs meeting in Paris endorsed parts of a plan to
contain  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. dropped 0.3 percent to 5,118.25. Its October futures
settled at 5,122. The BSE-200 Index decreased 0.3 percent.  Reliance retreated 3.8 percent to 833.8 rupees, the most
since Sept. 22. Profit in the quarter ended September rose 16
percent to 57.03 billion rupees ($1.16 billion) from a year ago,
the Mumbai-based company said Oct. 15. That matched the median
estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Reliance, controlled by billionaire  Mukesh Ambani , may earn
less from every barrel of oil processed at its Jamnagar complex,
the world’s largest, as global refining capacity tops growth in
fuel demand. The company, which sold stakes in 21 fields to BP
Plc for $7.2 billion to gain technology, may take as long as
three years to reverse a slump in production from  India ’s
biggest natural gas deposit.  ‘Stagnant Margins’  “Refining has helped them this quarter after fuel demand
in  Asia  rose,” said Rina Sanghavi, a Kolkata-based research
analyst at SPA Securities Ltd. “This may not sustain as their
margins are stagnating from quarter to quarter.”  Reliance shares were reduced to ‘add’ from ‘buy’ at Kotak
Institutional Equities, with a price target of 1,000 rupees.  Tata Consultancy declined 1.2 percent to 1,120.25 rupees,
halting a three-day, 8.9 percent rally. Net income may climb 16
percent to 25.2 billion rupees in the quarter ended September,
according to median estimate of 28 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Earnings are due later today.  Infosys gained 0.1 percent to 2,746.55 rupees.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) ,
the third-biggest software services provider, shed 1.8 percent
to 356.8 rupees.  Tata Motors climbed 4.5 percent to 188.1 rupees. The stock
has surged 21 percent this month, headed for the best October in
eight years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage
lender, climbed 1 percent to 673.45 rupees after profit rose 20
percent to 9.71 billion rupees, beating estimates.  Monetary Policy   Inflation must ease before  interest rates  can be reduced,
 Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said on Oct. 12,
signaling policy makers may maintain their tight monetary
stance. The RBI raised rates for a 12th time since March 2010 on
Sept. 16 and its next policy meeting is on Oct. 25.  The wholesale-price index rose 9.72 percent from a year ago
after a 9.78 percent jump in August, the trade ministry said on
Oct. 14. The median of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 9.75 percent increase. An inflation rate of a more
than 9 percent is above the central bank’s “comfort level,”
Subbarao said on Oct. 13.  Overseas investors bought a net 6.66 billion rupees of
Indian equities on Oct. 13, taking their total investment in
stocks this year to 10.5 billion rupees, according to  data  from
the market regulator. They withdrew a net $2.4 billion in
August, the most since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
