South  Sudan  plans to introduce curbs
on spending at government agencies to make the budget more
transparent.  The measures include immediate implementation of monthly
cash limits for spending agencies, the government said in an e-
mailed statement. Further steps effective from next month
include controls over payments to vendors and the signing of
government contracts.  South Sudan’s president,  Salva Kiir , has vowed to fight
corruption and increase transparency. The country gained control
of about 75 percent of Sudan’s daily oil production when it
seceded in July. Kiir has promised to force government officials
to publish details of their finances and to regulate land sales.  Kosti Manibe Ngai, the minister of finance and economic
planning, told top officials last week that spending must be
limited in order to slow inflation, according to the
government’s statement.  The  United Nations  has backed South Sudan’s campaign
against corruption and called on the international community to
help the new country recover stolen funds from banks throughout
the world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
