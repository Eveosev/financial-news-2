Brazil ’s real fell from a one-month
high after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s spokesman said
there will be no quick end to the European debt crisis that is
endangering global economic growth.  The real weakened 2.4 percent to 1.7741 per  U.S. dollar 
today, from 1.7328 on Oct. 14. The currency gained 2.2 percent
last week and reached 1.7265 on Oct. 14, the strongest level
since Sept. 16.  European leaders won’t fulfill any “dreams” of a quick
end to the situation at their Oct. 23 summit, Steffen Seibert,
Merkel’s chief spokesman, told reporters in Berlin today. Brazil
could experience an exodus of capital should the European
sovereign-debt crisis worsen, an International Monetary Fund
director said in an interview.  “The market remains wary,” said Andre de Carvalho Ferreira, director of Nova Futura DTVM Ltda., a brokerage firm
in  Sao Paulo .  Worsening debt problems in  Greece  and other European
countries could have consequences on trade, IMF Executive
Director Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr. said in an interview in
Paris yesterday. He said he doesn’t expect an exacerbation of
the crisis.  Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contracts due in
January 2013 held at 10.55 percent. Futures contracts suggest
traders bet the central bank will lower the benchmark interest
rate a half percentage point from 12 percent at a two-day
meeting ending Oct. 19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inflation Outlook  Economists covering Brazil raised their 2012 inflation
forecast for a seventh week. Consumer prices will increase 5.61
percent next year, according to the median forecast in an Oct.
14 central bank survey of about 100 economists published today,
up from a forecast of 5.59 percent the previous week. Economists
also raised their 2013 inflation forecast to 4.9 percent from
4.85 percent.  Policy makers cut the benchmark  interest rate  a half
percentage point from 12.5 percent on Aug. 31, after raising it
five times this year. Annual inflation was 7.31 percent last
month, the fastest in six years.  Reports last week showed growth in  Latin America ’s largest
economy was slower than analysts forecast. Retail sales
contracted 0.4 percent in August, the biggest drop since March
2010, while the economic activity index, a proxy for gross
domestic product, fell 0.53 percent, the most since December
2008.  “The central bank is pretty comfortable with the
assumption that inflation will come down,” Mauricio Junqueira,
who helps manage about $300 million at Squanto Investimentos in
Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview. “There’s a great
chance we’ll get negative GDP growth in the third quarter.
Slower activities at some point will get inflation down.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
