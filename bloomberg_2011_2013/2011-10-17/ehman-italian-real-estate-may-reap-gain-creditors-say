A restructuring of  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ’s Italian real estate fund will bring “an
immediate substantial gain” to the defunct firm’s commerical
paper unit as 116 million euros ($159.5 million) of embargoed
funds are released, Lehman creditors said in a court filing.  The Lehman unit would get its investment back on the real
estate in two to three years, the creditors committee said in
the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
