The executive board of New York’s
second-biggest union approved a revised contract with Governor
 Andrew Cuomo  that may preserve thousands of jobs.  The board voted 91-18 to approve the accord, Darcy Wells, a
union spokeswoman, said in an e-mail statement. Union officials
met today in  Albany , the state capital.  The membership of the  Public Employees Federation  will now
have a chance to vote on the four-year agreement. Cuomo has
promised to delay until Nov. 4 almost 3,500 layoffs that were
set to begin Oct. 19, to give workers time to vote. Last month,
the rank-and-file rejected a five-year deal that was endorsed by
PEF leadership, prompting Cuomo to order the layoffs.  The new agreement calls for no salary increases for three
years, with a raise of 2 percent for 2014, the union said in a
statement yesterday. It also includes reimbursement for nine
furlough days payable at the end of the agreement, the union
said.  The PEF represents 55,000 professional, scientific and
technical employees. In August, the 66,000-member Civil Service
Employees Association, the state’s biggest union, approved a
similar contract.  Both accords are part of Cuomo’s effort to win labor
acceptance of cost-cutting measures under the threat of
dismissals. Cuomo, a 53-year-old Democrat, gave the unions the
choice as part of his fiscal 2012 budget, which includes
$450 million in labor-cost savings and no new taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
