Nigeria ’s inflation rate may drop
below 10 percent in October following a record increase in
 interest rates  and an easing in food prices, Tunde Lemo, deputy
governor of the central bank, said.  “The Central Bank of Nigeria is in a tightening mood,”
Lemo said in an interview in the capital, Abuja, today. “We
will ensure single-digit inflation remains, we expect a good
harvest.”  The central bank of Africa’s biggest oil producer raised
its benchmark interest rate by 2.75 percentage points to a
record 12 percent on Oct. 10 to help boost the naira and curb
price pressures. Inflation accelerated for the first time in
four months in September, reaching 10.3 percent, the statistics
office said on Oct. 14. The central bank aims to keep inflation
under 10 percent.  Food prices, which make up about half of the  consumer price
index , rose 9.5 percent in September from 8.7 percent in the
previous month, the statistics agency said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
