Lowe’s Cos., the second-largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, will close 20 U.S. stores, affecting
1,950 workers, and plans to slow its North American expansion
next year as it works to improve sales.  Half of the locations closed at the end of business
yesterday, and the remaining 10 will be shut within about a
month, Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe’s said today in a
statement. The closings will reduce earnings by about 17 cents
to 20 cents a share this fiscal year, the company said.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Niblock  has streamlined
operations this year and closed seven stores in August after
sales at older outlets trailed  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  for the ninth
straight quarter. Lowe’s cut its forecast for fiscal 2011 profit
that same month, saying consumers were scaling back home-
improvement projects.  “They’re taking a finer-tooth comb to operations and
stores they’re going to open going forward, an acknowledgement
that they’re a mature company in a mature industry,”  David Strasser , an analyst at Janney Capital Markets in  New York , said
today by telephone. He rates Lowe’s shares “neutral.”  Lowe’s advanced 0.5 percent to $20.89 at the close in New
York. The shares have declined 17 percent this year.  Lowe’s said today it has discontinued a number of planned
new locations and now expects to open 10 to 15 outlets a year in
 North America  starting in 2012, less than a previous plan of
about 30 a year. The company said it is on track to open about
25 stores this year, as planned.  Closing Costs  Store closing costs, including leases, firing workers and
adjusting inventories, will be $100 million to $130 million,
according to a securities filing.  Employees at the stores to be closed, which are spread
across 15 U.S. states, will receive pay and benefits for 60 to
90 days, the company said.  Lowe’s said Aug. 15 that per-share profit in the year
through Feb. 3 would be $1.48 to $1.54. The planned closings
weren’t included in that forecast, Lowe’s said today. The
average of 22 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg is $1.59
a share.  Lowe’s said today it has more than 1,725 stores in the
U.S.,  Canada  and  Mexico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
