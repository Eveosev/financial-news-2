Top European Union officials called
on banks to shoulder a fair share of the burden of restoring the
crisis-hit economy to health.  “They should make a fairer contribution to the common
good,” European Commission President  Jose Barroso  told
reporters in Brussels today after a meeting with labor and
employer leaders. Some behavior in the financial sector has been
“of a criminal nature.”  European governments are now assessing proposals for a
financial transaction tax, he said.  Speaking at the same briefing, European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy  said a “fair distribution” of burdens is
necessary at a time when austerity measures are biting in much
of Europe.  “In this regard, the contribution of the financial sector
can play an important role,” Van Rompuy said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
