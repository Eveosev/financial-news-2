Thailand â€™s government will need to
spend about 100 billion baht to revive the economy after the
nation suffered its most severe floods in more than 50 years,
Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said.  The government may need to review some of its policies
after the disaster, Yingluck told reporters in Bangkok today.
The government may also have to borrow funds to cover
reconstruction costs, she said, without giving details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
