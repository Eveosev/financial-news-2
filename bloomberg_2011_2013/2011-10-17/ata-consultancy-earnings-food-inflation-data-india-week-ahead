Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) ,
India’s largest software exporter, is among the companies that
will report earnings this week for the quarter ended Sept. 30.  The Mumbai-based company’s profit rose 16.7 percent to 25.2
billion rupees, according to a median estimate of 28 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Indian code writers may be
regaining contracts in the U.S. that they lost in the wake of
the 2008 financial crisis. A Forrester Inc. report on Sept. 16
said U.S. business and government spending on IT goods and
services, will increase 6.4 percent to an estimated $802 billion
in 2012. Housing Development Finance Corp.’s figures are also
due today.  Other companies that are scheduled to share their quarterly
performance this week include Hero Motocorp Ltd.,  Jindal Steel &
Power Ltd. (JSP)  and Jet Airways India Ltd. tomorrow; HDFC Bank Ltd.
on Oct. 19; Bajaj Auto Ltd. and Cairn India Ltd. on Oct. 20; and
Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and JSW Steel Ltd. on Oct. 21.  The commerce ministry will release food inflation data for
the week ended Oct. 8 on Oct. 20. An index measuring wholesale
prices of agricultural products rose 9.32 percent in the week
ended Oct. 1 from a year earlier, sustaining pressure on the
central bank to maintain its tight monetary policy. The  Reserve
Bank  of India has raised its benchmark repurchase rate 12 times
starting March 2010 to rein in inflation.  The BSE India Sensitive Index advanced 5.2 percent last
week, the best performance since the five-day period ended Sept.
4, on optimism corporate earnings will weather a global economic
slowdown. Jindal Steel & Power, a maker of sponge iron and
cement, was the biggest gainer on the index.  India ’s 10-year bonds fell in Mumbai on concern inflation
near a 13-month high and increased debt sales will damp demand
for debt. The yields on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021
rose 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, last week to 8.78
percent, according to the central bank’s trading system. That is
the highest level for 10-year securities since August 2008.  The rupee strengthened 0.3 percent last week to 49.02 a
dollar as a jump in stocks increased prospects for inflows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
