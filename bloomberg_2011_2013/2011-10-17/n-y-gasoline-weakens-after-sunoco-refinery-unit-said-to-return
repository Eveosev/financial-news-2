New York  gasoline slipped as  Sunoco
Inc. (SUN)  was said to start a fluid catalytic cracker at its Marcus
Hook refinery in Pennsylvania.  The unit is up and running, said a person with knowledge of
the situation who declined to be identified because the
information is not public. Sunoco shut part of the unit for
maintenance that was expected to last about four days, Kevin
Sunday, a spokesman for the  Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection , said Oct. 11.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor narrowed 1.62 cents to 6.13 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:16
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
fell 7.09 cents to $2.8313 a gallon.  PBF Energy Partners LP reported emissions yesterday because
of the outage of a boiler associated with a fluid catalytic
cracker at its Delaware City, Delaware, refinery, according to a
filing made with the National Response Center. Emissions from
the unit also were reported last week.  Colonial Pipeline Co., which operates the largest line
linking U.S. Gulf refiners to U.S. markets, will allocate
distillate fuel shipments Line 2 for Cycle 59, the company said
in a bulletin to shippers.  The differential versus heating oil futures for ultra-low-
sulfur diesel in the  Gulf Coast  fell 0.25 cent to a discount of
0.9 cent a gallon. Prompt delivery dropped 2.56 cents to
$3.0237.  To contact the reporter on this story:
