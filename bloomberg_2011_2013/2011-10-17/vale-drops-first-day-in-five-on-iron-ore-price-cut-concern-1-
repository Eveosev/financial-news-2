Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, fell the most in three weeks on concern it is
cutting prices for the steel-making material.  Vale dropped 6.1 percent to 38.66 reais at 2:44 p.m.  Sao
Paulo  time, leading decliners. The benchmark Bovespa index
slipped 2.5 percent. Shares have fallen 18 percent in the past
year, compared to the Bovespa’s 25 percent drop.  O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper  reported  Oct. 15 that Vale
is giving Chinese customers the option to pay for  iron ore  in
the fourth quarter at close to the spot market price as miners
cede to pressure from Chinese steelmakers unhappy with paying
the higher prices set in quarterly contracts. It is the first
day of trading after Vale shareholders got $3 billion in
dividends on Oct. 14.  “The fourth quarter will be much more difficult than what
was expected in terms of prices in  China ,” Marco Saravalle, an
equity analyst at Coinvalores Corretora de Valores, said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “There’s a formula. But there is no way
to escape spot prices for very long.”  Vale’s press office declined to comment on the O Estado
story in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
