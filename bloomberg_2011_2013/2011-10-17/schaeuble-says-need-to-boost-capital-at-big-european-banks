German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said he expects the European Union’s regulators to
take decisions that will ensure that the bloc’s biggest banks
have enough capital to deal with the sovereign debt crisis.  “We need for systemic banks all over Europe, in the Europe
of 27, enough capital,” Schaeuble said in English in remarks at
 Chatham House  in London. “That’s what we are doing and I think
we will get a decision from the European authorities.”  Schaeuble also said the euro region will use the enhaced
European Financial Stability Facility “in a flexible way and in
the most efficient way. I think we will get it.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
