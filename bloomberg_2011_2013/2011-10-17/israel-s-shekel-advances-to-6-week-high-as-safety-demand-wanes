Israel ’s shekel strengthened to the
highest in almost six weeks as emerging-market stocks gained for
a ninth day after European leaders endorsed parts of a plan to
contain the region’s debt crisis.  The shekel rose as much as 1 percent to 3.6187 per dollar,
the highest since Sept. 6, and was at 3.6305 as of 3:26 p.m. in
Tel Aviv. The TA-25 Index gained as much as 1.2 percent today,
before closing 0.3 percent lower. The measure surged 4.3 percent
yesterday, the most since April 2009.  “There is less worry in the world about a recession and
the dissolving of the Euro partnership so people are turning
away from the dollar,” Dror Sachs, chief trader at First
International  Bank of Israel  Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by phone.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose as much as 1.9 percent
as the Group of 20 finance ministers and central banks set an
Oct. 23 summit of European leaders in Brussels as the deadline
to settle differences and flesh out a strategy to avoid a Greek
default, bolster banks and curb contagion. The MSCI Index pared
the gains after  Germany  damped expectations for a fast
resolution to the crisis.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit bond due
January 2022 rose to its highest level in three weeks,
increasing three basis points, or 0.03 percent, to 4.71 percent,
the highest since Sept. 25, at the 2:45 p.m close in  Tel Aviv .
The Tel-Bond 40 index of corporate bonds gained 0.2 percent to
260.18, the highest since Aug. 4.  ‘Mood Change’  “There is a mood change in the world and investors are
turning to more risky assets such as equities and corporate
bonds,” said Gil Chen, a bond trader at Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  The Bank of Israel said today that based on fiscal
developments in the first eight months of this year its forecast
for the 2011  budget deficit  stands at close to 3 percent of
gross domestic product, which is within the budget framework.  Two-year  interest-rate  swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, gained four basis points
to 2.80 percent.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  cut the benchmark
interest rate by a quarter point to 3 percent on Sept. 26 as
inflation slowed, growth eased and  Europe , one of the country’s
key export markets, grappled with its debt crisis. Annual
inflation slowed to 2.9 percent from 3.4 percent in September,
the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said Oct. 14, below the 3.2
percent median estimate of 18 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the period, fell two basis
points to 169, implying annual inflation of 1.69 percent. The
yield on inflation-linked bonds due June 2013 was rose seven
basis points to 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
