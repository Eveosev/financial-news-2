Hungary is “almost sure” to take
further steps this year to reduce the country’s stock of
foreign-currency loans, Janos Lazar, head of the ruling party’s
parliamentary group, told reporters today.  Ruling party lawmakers would be happy if “hardly any”
foreign-currency loans remained next year, Lazar said. The
government needs to “convince” commercial banks to heed the
law on the early repayment of foreign-currency mortgages, which
forces lenders to swallow exchange-rate losses on such loans
when borrowers repay them in a lump sum this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
