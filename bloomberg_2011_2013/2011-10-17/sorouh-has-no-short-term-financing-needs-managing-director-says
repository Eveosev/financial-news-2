Sorouh Real Estate PJSC,  Abu Dhabi ’s
second-biggest property developer by market value, expects to
win contracts from the government for real estate projects in
the next few years, a company official said.  “Sorouh is currently working with the government to win
new projects,” Managing Director Abubaker al-Khouri told
reporters in Abu Dhabi today. “We got 5.3 billion ($1.4
billion) to 5.4 billion dirhams worth of work from the
government over the past two years and we expect a lot more in
the next years.”  Sorouh shares slumped 4.3 percent at 11.13 a.m. in Abu
Dhabi to 90 fils, the lowest intraday level since December 2005
when the company listed its shares. The stock is down 49 percent
in the past year.  The falling share price “has a lot to do with sentiment,”
al-Khouri said. “There’s uncertainty internationally. I don’t
think it fairly reflects the value of the company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
