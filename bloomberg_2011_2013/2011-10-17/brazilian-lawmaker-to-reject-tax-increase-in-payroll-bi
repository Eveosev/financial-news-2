A Brazilian lawmaker who is
sponsoring a government proposal to reduce payroll taxes said he
will reject any attempt by the tax agency to increase levies on
companies and investors.  President  Dilma Rousseff  signed a  decree  Aug. 2 that
reduces payroll taxes for manufacturers of software, textiles,
furniture and shoes. According to a story published today by  O
Estado de S. Paulo  newspaper,  Brazil ’s tax agency is seeking to
incorporate new taxes on company profits into the decree, which
needs congressional approval.  “If there is any tax increase, we definitely won’t accept
it, because the purpose of the bill is to cut expenses, not
increase them,” lawmaker  Renato Molling  said in a phone
interview from Sapiranga, a city in the Southern state of  Rio
Grande  do Sul. “The tax agency told me that they aren’t
creating new taxes, but only making adjustments to existing
ones.”  Molling will meet with members of the country’s tax agency
tomorrow to clarify the impact of the changes being proposed. He
said he expects the Lower House to vote on the bill next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
