European Commission PresidentJose Barroso said the commission is discussing a proposal for
governments to use structural funds in a guarantee mechanism to
support bank liquidity.    The commission, the European Union’s executive in Brussels,
has adopted a proposal under which EU governments
“could use structural funds as a guarantee mechanism, because
there are in some countries real problems of credit crunch,”
Barroso told reporters today in Brussels. The proposal envisages
“a guarantee mechanism for countries that are facing particular
problems of liquidity with their banks,” he said.   “We have to help those countries to find a way of getting
some finance to the small business, to the companies, to the
households,” Barroso said. “We’re doing everything we can to
mobilize and front-load structural funds.”  Barroso also said the commission will unveil proposals this
week on “criminal responsibility” for wrong-doing at financial
institutions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
