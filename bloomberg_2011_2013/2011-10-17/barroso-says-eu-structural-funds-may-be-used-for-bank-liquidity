 European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  said the commission is discussing a proposal for
governments to use structural funds as a guarantee mechanism to
help with bank liquidity.    “We’re doing everything we can to front-load structural
funds,” Barroso told reporters today in Brussels after meeting
with labor and employer leaders.    Barroso also said the commission will unveil proposals this
week on “criminal responsibility” for wrong-doing at financial
institutions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
