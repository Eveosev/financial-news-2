International and domestic flights
out of  Buenos Aires  resumed after ash clouds from a volcano in
Chile, which disrupted flights yesterday and this morning,
cleared.  Lan Airlines SA (LAN) , Latin America’s biggest airline by market
value, said it was “gradually” resuming flights after studies
showed “no presence of ash in the airspace over Buenos Aires.”
Lan had earlier canceled flights from Buenos Aires to Lima,
Santiago and Montevideo. Aerolineas Argentinas SA, which
canceled 39 domestic flights this morning, said on its website
that travel was re-starting.  Chile’s Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex began to
erupt June 4, generating ash clouds that led to flight
cancellations in June and July because of concern that they may
clog jet engines. The disruptions spread around the globe to  New
Zealand  and Australia before shifting winds made travel possible
again.  A thin coating of grey ash drifted down on Buenos Aires
yesterday as the  ash cloud  returned. Chilean towns near the
volcano have been under a “red alert” since the eruption began
in June while damage to livestock and crops from ash led
Argentina to declare an agriculture emergency earlier this year
in the southern provinces of Rio Negro, Chubut and Neuquen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
