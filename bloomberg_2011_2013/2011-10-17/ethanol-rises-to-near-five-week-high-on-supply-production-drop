Ethanol futures advanced to almost a
five-week high in  Chicago  on lower inventories and production of
the biofuel.  Prices gained for a third session following a Oct. 12
Energy Department report that stockpiles amounted to 16.9
million barrels, the lowest level since the week ended Dec. 31,
while production was 860,000 barrels a day.  “We’re still looking for material in the New York
Harbor,” said Justin Dirico, senior ethanol trader at SCB &
Associates LLC in Chicago. “There’s definitely barrels needed
in the prompt months.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 3.1 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.732 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since Sept. 13. Futures have gained 15 percent
this year and are up 4 percent since the report.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago gained 4 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $2.815 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel
increased 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.92, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.915 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive was unchanged
at $2.825.  The tighter supply for ethanol was exacerbated when a train
carrying the fuel for Archer Daniels Midland Co. derailed on
Oct. 7, forcing residents of Tiskilwa,  Illinois , to evacuate,
Dirico said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
