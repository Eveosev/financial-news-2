Thailand â€™s Cabinet will tomorrow
consider widening the 2012  budget deficit  by 50 billion baht to
fund flood reconstruction, said Worawit Jumpeerath, head of the
Budget Bureau.  The reconstruction budget will be increased to 130 billion
baht from an earlier estimate of 80 billion baht, Worawit told
reporters in Bangkok today.  The government is also reviewing its borrowing plan to
increase infrastructure investment to prevent future floods,
Deputy Prime Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said, without giving
details.  The Cabinet in September approved a budget deficit of 350
billion baht for the fiscal year started Oct. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
