Stormy weather about 100 miles (160
kilometers) north of  Mexico ’s Yucatan Peninsula has a 60 percent
chance of strengthening into a depression or tropical storm
within two days, the National Hurricane Center  said .  The thunderstorms and showers are accompanied by “strong
gusty” winds in the southeastern  Gulf of Mexico , the NHC said
today on its  website . Heavy rain is expected over the Yucatan,
western Cuba, the Florida Keys and south Florida the next couple
of days, the Miami-based center said. The system is moving
northward at 5 to 10 mph, it said.  Storm systems this time of the year are closely watched as
they may threaten oil and natural gas interests in the Gulf and
agriculture in the U.S. South. Florida is the second-largest
citrus producer after  Brazil . The Gulf accounts for 31 percent
of U.S. oil output and 43 percent of refining capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
