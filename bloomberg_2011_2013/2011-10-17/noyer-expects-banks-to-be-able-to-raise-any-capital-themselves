European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Christian Noyer  said he expects banks to be able
to raise any additional capital they need without government
support.  “I expect French banks to cover any additional capital
needs by their own means, either through new share issuances or
through retained profits,” Noyer, who is also Governor of the
Bank of  France , said at a conference in Paris today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
