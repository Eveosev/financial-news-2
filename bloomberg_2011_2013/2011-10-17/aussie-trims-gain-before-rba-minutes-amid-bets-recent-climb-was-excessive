The Australian dollar halted gains
before the  Reserve Bank  of Australia tomorrow releases minutes
of its Oct. 4 meeting when Governor Glenn Stevens signaled
there’s more scope to cut rates if necessary.  The so-called Aussie snapped a three-day advance versus its
U.S. counterpart on speculation its recent climb was excessive.
The  New Zealand dollar  slid after a report showed the nation’s
services industry slowed in September. Losses in the South
Pacific currencies were limited as Asian stocks extended a
global rally from last week.  “After such a big move, the Australian dollar getting a
few wobbles is certainly understandable,” said Gavin Stacey,
chief interest-rate strategist at  Barclays Capital  in Sydney.
“Once you’ve had such a large move, you become more susceptible
to downside surprises for any disappointment on RBA or the
global policy front.”  Australia ’s dollar declined 0.2 percent to $1.0316 at 11:24
a.m. in Sydney from Oct. 14 when it completed a 5.9 percent
weekly surge. The currency fell 0.2 percent to 79.71 yen from
last week. The New Zealand dollar slid 0.3 percent to 80.31 U.S.
cents and lost 0.3 percent to 62.02 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks rose 1.1 percent,
following a 1.5 percent jump in MSCI’s World Index on Oct. 14.  Stevens said in a statement accompanying the RBA’s decision
to leave rates unchanged at 4.75 percent that “an improved
inflation outlook would increase the scope for monetary policy
to provide some support to demand, should that prove
necessary.”  The Australian dollar’s 10-day relative strength index
versus its U.S. counterpart, is at 66.4, nearing the 70-level
that some traders see as a sign that an asset’s price may
reverse direction after rising too rapidly.  An index for  New Zealand ’s service industry fell to 53.2 in
September from a revised 53.8 in August, Bank of New Zealand
Ltd. and Business New Zealand, a Wellington-based employer
group, said on the Business New Zealand website. A reading above
50 indicates an expansion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
