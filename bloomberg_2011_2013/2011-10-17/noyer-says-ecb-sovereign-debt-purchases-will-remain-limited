European Central Bank governor
 Christian Noyer  said the ECB will continue to resist buying
sovereign debt.  Central bank purchases of government debt in the U.K. and
the U.S. have helped keep long-term  interest rates  “at very low
levels, irrespective of their fiscal situations,” Noyer told a
conference in Paris. “By contrast, purchases of sovereign debt
by the Eurosystem have remained extremely limited and will stay
so,” he said. “Our objectives are very circumscribed: to avoid
disruptions in monetary policy transmission. Any lasting
liquidity backstop has to come from governments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
