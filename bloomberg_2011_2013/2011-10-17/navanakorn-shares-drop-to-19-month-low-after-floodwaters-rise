Navanakorn Pcl, a Thai developer of
industrial land, dropped to the lowest level in 19 months in
Bangkok trading after floodwaters at its industrial complex
rose.  The shares slid 6.5 percent to 1.30 baht as of 3:11 a.m.
local time, set for the lowest close since March 11, 2010.  The government ordered the evacuation of people in the
Navanakorn industrial zone in Pathum Thani on the outskirts of
Bangkok today because of the flooding, Wim Roongwatanachinda, a
spokesman for the national flood center, said on the state
television network today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
