Ukraine’s government wants to cut
the state  budget deficit  to 1 percent of gross domestic product
in 2013 from 1.6 percent next year,  Finance Ministry  said.  The ministry sees the budget gap at 1.5 percent in 2014,
the Ministry said in a statement on its website today. GDP may
expand 4.5 percent in 2013 and 4.2 percent in 2014, the ministry
said. The inflation rate may drop to 5.9 percent in 2013 and 5
percent in 2014, according to the statement.  Ukraine is relying on a $15.6 billion standby loan with the
 International Monetary Fund  that has been on hold since March.
The country, which needs to reduce the budget shortfall by
raising utility bills, has received $3.4 billion of the loan so
far.  The government of Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  is planning
to borrow 84.6 million hryvnia ($10.56 billion) in 2013 and
spend 77.6 billion hryvnia to repay loans, according to the
statement.  Borrowing plans for 2014 are 111.7 billion hryvnia, while
93.4 billion hryvnia will be spent to repay earlier loans, the
ministry said.  The Cabinet will “prefer domestic sources to finance the
state budget to ensure less dependency on foreign capital
markets,” the ministry said.  The sale of state assets is expected to bring 10 billion
hryvnia into the state budget in 2013 and in 2014, according to
the statement.  The cabinet seeks to “expand” cooperation with the  World
Bank , the International Monetary Fund, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and other international financial
organizations in 2013 and 2014, the ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
