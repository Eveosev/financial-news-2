Poland ’s WIG20 Index declined 14.74,
or 0.6 percent, to 2,285.91 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
trimming this month’s gain to 4.4 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, declined 0.3 percent to 145.5
zloty, after falling as much as 1.4 percent. Copper fell from a
three-week high after  Germany  said European Union leaders won’t
provide a quick fix to the region’s debt crisis that global
policy makers are pushing for at an Oct. 23 summit.  Orco Property Group (OPG)  SA jumped 4.3 percent to 18.15
zloty, closing at the highest level in two weeks in Warsaw
trading as the real-estate developer completed the sale of its
Russian assets for 53 million euros ($74 million).  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , Poland’s second-largest refiner,
sank 3.3 percent to 26.11 zloty, falling for the first time in
four days as crude oil slipped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
