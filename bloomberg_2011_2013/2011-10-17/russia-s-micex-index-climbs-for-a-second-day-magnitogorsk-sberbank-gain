Russian stocks sank the most in
almost two weeks, paring last week’s gains as declining
confidence that a solution will be found to  Europe ’s debt crisis
pushed down commodity prices.  The 30-stock Micex Index fell 2 percent to 1,403.05 by the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest drop since Oct. 4. OAO
Novolipetsk Steel tumbled 4.1 percent, while oil producer OAO
Surgutneftegas retreated 3.5 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS
index fell 1.5 percent to 1,427.31.  Russian stocks climbed the most last week since March 2010
as growing optimism a solution will be found for Europe’s debt
problems and better-than-expected U.S. economic data lifted the
price of crude,  Russia ’s chief export earner. German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s chief spokesman said today an Oct. 23 deadline
for a plan to ease the region’s problems won’t bring a swift
resolution to the crisis.  The comments “were sufficiently bearish to persuade
traders to take a more defensive stance,” Julian Rimmer, a
trader of Russian shares at CF Global Trading in  London , said in
e-mailed comments. “Russia is the levered play on oil, on risk,
on everything. Its indices don’t do things by half measures.”  Oil traded in  New York  sank as much as 1.1 percent to
$85.88 a barrel, while Brent oil futures lost 3.1 percent to
$111.12 a barrel. Urals crude, Russia’s main blend, slid 0.5
percent to $114.29 a barrel, paring last week’s 10 percent
advance, its strongest in the period since May 2009.  Crude and natural gas together make up about 17 percent of
Russia’s gross domestic product, compared with a less than 10
percent contribution from commodities in Brazil.  Cheapest BRIC  Russian stocks are the cheapest among the so-called BRIC
nations, with shares in the Micex trading at an average 5 times
analysts’ earnings estimates, compared with a ratio of 9.5 for
stocks in  Brazil ’s Bovespa index, 11.2 for the Shanghai
Composite Index and 14.4 for the BSE India Sensitive Index. The
Micex is down 17 percent this year.  Global stocks and companies rallied on Oct. 14 as finance
chiefs began talks on Europe and U.S. retail sales rose in
September by the most in seven months, easing concern slumping
confidence and scant hiring will derail the world’s biggest
economy.  Russia’s trade with European Union countries accounted for
$453.6 billion, or almost half of the country’s total foreign
trade turnover in January through July 2011, according to
Russia’s Federal Service of State Statistics. The country sells
oil, natural gas and metals to EU.  Crisis ‘Dreams’  Global stocks and the euro fell after Steffen Seibert,
Merkel’s chief spokesman, said “dreams” that an Oct. 23 summit
will produce a solution to Europe’s problems “won’t be able to
be fulfilled.” Bonds maturing in two years’ time issued by
 Greece  yielded 67 percent today, compared with 6.8 percent for
similar-maturity Russian debt.  OAO Magnit, Russia’s largest supermarket chain by market
value, advanced 1.8 percent to 2,783.50 rubles. The company was
raised to “outperform” from “neutral” by analysts at Credit
Suisse Group AG who cited “operational improvements” and
“significant store rollout” in an e-mailed note today.  Evraz Group SA (EVR)  climbed as much as 14 percent to $21.40 in
London trading before retreating 2.1 percent to $18.35. The
Russian steelmaker registered in Luxembourg said it plans to
shift its base to London via a share swap with a new company and
seek entry into the U.K.’s benchmark FTSE-100 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
