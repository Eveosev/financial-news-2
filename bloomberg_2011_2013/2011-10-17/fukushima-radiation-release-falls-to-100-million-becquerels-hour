The amount of radiation being
released by the damaged reactors at  Japan ’s crippled Fukushima
nuclear plant has fallen to about 8 million times less than at
the height of the disaster,  Tokyo  Electric Power Co. said.  The three reactors are emitting about 100 million
becquerels an hour, the company known as Tepco said in a  monthly
update  on its so-called roadmap for resolving the worst civil
nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986. The update was released
today in Tokyo.  Tepco said it expects to stabilize its crippled Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear plant by the end of the year, maintaining the
timetable announced by the government last month. The company
has completed tsunami reinforcements at the plant, one of the
goals of its roadmap, it said.  The units that went into meltdown after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami will be brought into a state known as
cold shutdown by the end of the year,  Goshi Hosono , the minister
in charge of the government’s response to the disaster, said on
Sept. 20. Tepco earlier said the reactors would be stabilized by
about the middle of January.  A becquerel represents one radioactive decay per second and
involves the release of atomic energy, which can damage
human cells and DNA. Prolonged exposure to radiation can cause
leukemia and other forms of cancer, according to the  World
Nuclear Association .  To contact the reporter on this story:
