European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said bonds issued in common by euro-
area members can only work if  Europe  moves closer together.  “What is at the heart of the euro bond is a different
governance structure,” Stark told lawmakers in Brussels today.

instrument but it requires a transfer of sovereignty to the
supranational level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
