Britain paid the first installment
of its 3.25 billion-pound ($5.1 billion) bailout loan to
Ireland, Treasury minister Mark Hoban said.  The government disbursed 403.3 million pounds on Oct. 14,
Hoban said in a statement to Parliament in  London  today. The
loan matures in 2019 and carries an interest rate of 4.667
percent.  Last year, Ireland became the second euro-region country to
need a rescue as the cost of saving its banks threatened a rerun
of the Greek debt crisis. The U.K. commitment to aid Ireland
with a direct loan at a time when Britain is undergoing deep
spending cuts stirred opposition among some ruling  Conservative
Party  lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
