DiaSorin SpA (DIA) , an Italian supplier of
diagnostic tests, fell the most in more than four years in Milan
trading after cutting its sales and profit forecasts for the
year amid a “challenging” economic environment.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization probably will increase 20 percent to about 200
million euros ($275.3 million), and revenue should rise 11
percent to about 450 million euros, the Saluggia, Italy-based
company said in a statement today. DiaSorin in August predicted
profit of more than 200 million euros and sales of 465 million
euros to 475 million euros.  “Even though the macroeconomic environment will continue
to be complex and challenging, management believes that, in
2011, DiaSorin should be able to deliver a double-digit revenue
increase,” the company said in the statement.  DiaSorin sank 10 percent to 25.40 euros at the close in
Milan, giving the company a market value of 1.4 billion euros.
The decline was the biggest ever for the company, which first
sold shares to the public in July 2007.  Ebitda and sales will increase 9 percent and 10 percent a
year, respectively, through 2015, the company said. DiaSorin,
which is briefing investors and analysts today in Milan, will
generate cumulative cash flow of 600 million euros in the
period, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
