Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the
world’s biggest petrochemicals maker, said third-quarter profit
surged 54 percent, beating analysts’ estimates.  Net income  jumped to 8.2 billion riyals ($2.2 billion) from
5.3 billion riyals a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer
Mohamed Al-Mady said at a press conference in  Riyadh  today. The
estimate of four analysts was for a profit of 7.7 billion
riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Saudi petrochemical companies have been recovering from the
global financial crisis as  oil prices  soared and as demand from
fast-growing Asian economies including China and  India  rose. Oil
prices averaged about $90 a barrel in the third quarter compared
with $76 a barrel in the year-earlier period.  “An increase in output and sales, in addition to a
decrease in the cost of financing” helped boost profit,Al-Mady
said. Sales rose to 49 billion riyals from 38 billion riyals.  Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co., a unit of Sabic, said last
week third-quarter profit doubled as it gained from demand for
fertilizers and petrochemicals in  Asia . Yanbu National
Petrochemicals Co., another unit of Sabic, also posted a third-
quarter profit that more than doubled.  Sabic’s shares have lost 12 percent this year compared with
a 7.4 percent drop in the benchmark Tadawul All Share Index. The
shares lost 0.5 percent to close at 91.75 riyals today before
the results were announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
