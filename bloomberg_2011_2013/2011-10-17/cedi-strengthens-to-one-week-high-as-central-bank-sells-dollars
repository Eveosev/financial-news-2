Ghana ’s cedi headed for the highest
in a week as the central bank sold dollars.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
appreciated 0.6 percent to 1.6294 per dollar as of 3:04 p.m. in
Accra. A close at this level will be the strongest since Oct.
10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The central bank supported the market today, causing the
cedi to appreciate,” Lourens Harmse, a Johannesburg-based
currency trader at Absa Capital Ltd. said in an e-mailed
comment.  The central bank sold $98 million today, Adams Nyinaku,
head of treasury at the central bank, said in a telephone
interview. Out of the total, $48 million went to state oil
company  Ghana National Petroleum Corporation  to import crude, he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
