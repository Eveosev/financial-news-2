 Bank of Ireland Plc rose as much as
5.2 percent after the nation’s largest lender by assets agreed
to sell about 5 billion euros of loans at a 9 percent discount
averaged to par value.  The bank, which announced the sale on Oct. 14, traded up
3.1 percent at 10 euro cents as of 9:40 a.m. in Dublin trading.
While the lender said the transactions will have a “neutral”
impact on its capital reserves, UBS AG analyst John-Paul
Crutchley said in a note that the 9 percent discount compared to
his estimate of 15 percent average “haircuts” on its non-core
portfolio.  “Although the price of these disposals is an important
factor for the group’s” profit and loss account, “we think
that Bank of Ireland will benefit most from a smaller, more
profitable balance sheet,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
