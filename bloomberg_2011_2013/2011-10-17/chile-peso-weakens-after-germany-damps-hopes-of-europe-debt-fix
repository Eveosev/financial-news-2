Chile’s peso fell, following the
currency’s biggest weekly gain in almost two years, after
Germany damped expectations of a solution to Europe’s debt
crisis.  The peso declined 0.8 percent to 504.01 per  U.S. dollar 
from 499.76 on Oct. 14. The currency gained 3.8 percent last
week, its biggest increase since the period ended Nov. 13, 2009.  Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers ended
weekend talks in Paris by backing Europe’s plan to bolster banks
and avoid a Greek default, setting a deadline for a final
agreement of Oct. 23. Germany’s  Chancellor Angela Merkel  warned
of “dreams taking hold” that the planned package would solve
everything, according to a spokesman.  “The peso’s trading negatively after the German
comments,” said Katia Diaz, an economist at 4Cast Inc. in  New
York . “Germany tried to ease the markets’ hopes after
optimistic comments at the weekend and there’s been some
pullback.”  Copper, which accounts for more than half of  Chile ’s
exports, fell 0.9 percent.  Electricity prices in central Chile are set to fall between
4 percent and 5 percent in November, La Tercera wrote today,
citing people involved in the industry whom it didn’t identify.
The change will cut consumer price inflation next month by 0.11
percentage point to between 0 and 0.2 percent, economists at BCI
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
