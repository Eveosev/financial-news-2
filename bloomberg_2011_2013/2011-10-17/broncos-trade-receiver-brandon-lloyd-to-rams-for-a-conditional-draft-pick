The  Denver Broncos  agreed to trade
Pro Bowl wide receiver Brandon Lloyd to the  St. Louis Rams  for a
pick in the 2012 National Football League Draft, team general
manager John Elway said today on his Twitter page.  Lloyd, 30, will join a Rams team that has a league-low
three passing touchdowns this year. The Broncos will receive a
conditional selection in next yearâ€™s draft, Elway said.  A Pro Bowl selection in 2010, Lloyd led the NFL with 1,448
receiving yards last season. He has 19 catches for 283 yards and
no touchdowns in four games this season.  -- Editors: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
