Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Co. 
said it plans to quadruple job cuts to about 1,300 in  Japan 
after employees who accepted early retirement offer exceeded the
brokerage’s initial estimate.  The joint venture between  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. (8306)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  will cut the jobs by Jan. 31 to
eliminate personnel costs, said Hiroaki Konishi, a Tokyo-based
spokesman at the firm. The brokerage, which employed about 6,500
workers as of the end of June, said in July it may reduce about
300 jobs.  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley is reducing jobs and raising
capital after posting a loss of 145 billion yen ($1.9 billion)
last fiscal year hurt by wrong-way bets on fixed-income products.
The Tokyo based-joint venture has already cut about 270 workers
through an early retirement offer made in February targeting
employees aged 45 to 57.  More people applied for the voluntary leave as the
brokerage offered “higher level of extra retirement payments,”
the Nikkei newspaper said earlier today, without saying where it
obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
