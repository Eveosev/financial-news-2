Uganda ’s shilling fell for the first
time in four days against the dollar as companies including oil
importers sought the greenback to buy supplies.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
depreciated 0.4 percent down at 2,855 per dollar by 2.09 p.m. in
the capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It closed at 2,845 on Oct. 14.  “We saw some corporate demand mainly from the oil sector
seeking the greenback,” Rogers Lutaaya, a currency trader at
Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “The
recent appreciation of the shilling over the last few days”
prompted companies to buy dollars, he said, adding the shilling
is poised to weaken in the coming days because of the local
demand for the dollar.  Uganda’s shilling climbed 1.3 percent in the three days
through Oct. 14, the biggest three-day increase since Sept. 9.
The currency reached 2,897.50 on Sept. 23, the weakest since
June 1993. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a
more than 18-year high of 28.3 percent this month from 21.4
percent in August, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
