The U.S. corn harvest was 47 percent
complete as of Oct. 16, compared with 33 percent a week earlier
and the previous five-year average of 41 percent, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said.  An estimated 69 percent of the soybean crop was harvested,
up from 51 percent a week earlier and the five-year average of
61 percent for the date, the USDA said today in a  report .  About 73 percent of the winter-wheat crop was planted,
below the five-year average of 77 percent, according to the
report. A week earlier, 59 percent of the crop had been sown.
Winter wheat plants that had emerged rose to 44 percent,
compared with 28 percent a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
