California  said individual investors
ordered 12.5 percent of $2 billion in general-obligation bonds
the state is selling at yields of as much as 4.87 percent for
30-year debt.  The state took orders for $250 million of $1.8 billion in
tax-exempt bonds in the sale, according to  Tom Dresslar , a
spokesman for Treasurer Bill Lockyer. Preliminary yields ranged
as low as 1.15 percent on three-year securities, Dresslar said
by e-mail.  Ten-year bonds were priced to yield 3.51 percent, or 0.34
percentage point more than comparable-maturity securities in a
$2.5 billion sale in September. The 30-year bonds were offered
at 7 basis points more than in September.  “We were under no illusions that we were going to have to
take a slight bump due to the market trend,” Dresslar said in a
telephone interview.  During the September sale, the state sold a total of 25
percent of the bonds to individual investors after two days.  The 10-year bonds in today’s sale were offered at 98 basis
points above top-rated tax-exempt debt, while the 30-year bonds
were offered at 117 basis points above AAA debt. That’s down
from 109 basis points on 10-year bonds in September and up from
114 basis points on the 30-year bonds. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The so-called retail sale is expected to conclude tomorrow,
followed by a orders from institutional investors Oct. 19,
Dresslar said. In addition to the $1.8 billion in tax-exempt
bonds, California is offering $200 million in taxable debt.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Wedbush Securities Inc. and J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co. are managing the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
