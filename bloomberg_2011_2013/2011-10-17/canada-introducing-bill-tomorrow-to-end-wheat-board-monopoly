The Canadian government will
introduce legislation tomorrow to end the Canadian Wheat Board’s
monopoly on marketing wheat and barley in the country’s biggest
growing region, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said today.  Since 1942, western Canadian wheat and barley farmers have
been required by law to sell grain for human consumption to the
board, under a system the government created to stabilize
prices. Prime Minister  Stephen Harper ’s  Conservative Party ,
arguing that an open market will encourage investment and
innovation, has promised to eliminate the monopoly by August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
