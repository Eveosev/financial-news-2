Woolworths Ltd. (WOW) , Australia’s biggest
retailer, is seeking to raise A$500 million ($509 million) in a
sale of hybrid securities.  The unsecured subordinated notes due November 2036 will pay
investors between 325 basis points and 350 basis points more
than the bank bill swap rate, according to a stock exchange
filing today. Standard & Poor’s is expected to treat some of the
proceeds as equity until 2016, helping Sydney-based Woolworths
to maintain its A-  credit rating , according to the statement.  The sale “further optimizes our capital structure,” said
Woolworths Finance Director Tom Pockett in the statement.
“Woolworths is a solid  cash flow  generating business with a
conservative balance sheet.”  Woolworths can choose to redeem the notes from November
2016, and will pay an additional 100 basis-point margin to
investors from that date if it keeps the securities on issue, it
said in the statement.  The retailer can only repay investors if it has sold shares
or other securities that offer equity credit in the previous 12
months, according to the statement.  Hybrid notes blend debt and equity characteristics.
National  Australia  Bank Ltd., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG
are managing the Woolworths sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
