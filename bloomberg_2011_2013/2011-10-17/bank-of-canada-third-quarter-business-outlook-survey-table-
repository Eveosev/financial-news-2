The  Bank of Canada ’s Business Outlook
survey found that businesses are less optimistic about future sales
growth this quarter than they were in the previous quarter.  The future sales growth index fell to 6.00 in the third quarter
from 20.00 in the second quarter. The index is a measure of expected
sales volume over the next 12 months.  Following is a table compiled from the Bank of Canada business
outlook survey of senior managers at about 100 firms who are selected in
