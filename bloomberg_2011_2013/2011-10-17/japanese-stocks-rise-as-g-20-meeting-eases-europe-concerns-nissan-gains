Japanese stocks climbed, driving the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average to its highest close in a month, after
Group of 20 finance chiefs meeting in Paris endorsed parts of a
plan to contain Europe’s debt crisis.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-
largest lender by market value, gained 2.8 percent.  Sony Corp. (6758) 
jumped 5 percent after earnings at its mobile phone unit beat
analysts’ earnings estimates. Olympus Corp. slumped 24 percent
after auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers called for an investigation
into an acquisition.  “Investors are recovering their risk appetite,” said
 Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at Tachibana
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “We could see that G-20 countries
would cooperate with European countries in tackling the debt
crisis, which helped concern over the European crisis recede.”  The Nikkei 225 increased 1.5 percent to 8,879.60 at the 3
p.m. close in Tokyo, its highest close since Sept. 2. The
broader Topix gained 1.8 percent to 761.88, with about six
shares advancing for each that declined.  The Topix tumbled 17 percent this year through Oct. 14 amid
concern the U.S. would fall into another recession while
 Europe ’s crisis threatens to spread to the banking system. The
slide has cut the price of shares on the index to 0.9 times
estimated book value, near the lowest since March 2009.  Exporters Advance  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4
percent today. The  S&P 500  rose 1.7 percent in  New York  on Oct.
14, pushing the gauge to its biggest weekly gain since July 2009,
after retail sales exceeding economists’ estimates, easing
concern the world’s biggest economy will slow.  Exporters advanced. Honda Motor Co., which gets about 44
percent of its sales from  North America , rose 3.6 percent to
2,329 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Japan ’s biggest automaker, gained
2.9 percent to 2,629 yen. Nintendo Co., maker of Wii game
consoles, increased 3.2 percent to 12,150 yen.  G-20 finance ministers and central bankers concluded
weekend talks in Paris, endorsing parts of an emerging plan to
avoid a Greek default, bolster banks and curb contagion. They
set an Oct. 23 summit of European leaders in Brussels as the
deadline for it to be delivered.  Hurdles to a deal include resistance from bankers to a
deeper restructuring of Greek debt as well as disagreements
between Europe’s capitals over how to multiply the firepower of
their bailout fund and recapitalize financial institutions.  ‘Contaminated’  Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, surged 5 percent to 1,607 yen. Sony Ericsson Mobile
Communications AB posted third-quarter pretax profit of 31
million euros ($43 million), beating by 37 percent the average
estimate of 22.6 million euros in a SME Direkt survey.  Olympus Corp. (7733) , a maker of cameras and medical equipment,
tumbled 24 percent to 1,555 yen, extending its slump for a
second straight day. A PricewaterhouseCoopers report
commissioned by ousted President Michael C. Woodford said the
company may face legal and regulatory scrutiny over payments
made to advisers in 2008.  The company said it dismissed Woodford last week because he
“wouldn’t listen” to Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa. The British
executive said he was fired after challenging the transactions.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura
Holdings Inc. cut Olympus’s ratings after the ouster.  “The whole board is contaminated and that company needs to
be cleaned up,” Woodford said in an interview yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
