Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
traveled to  Havana  for “rigorous” medical exams to begin
tomorrow and plans to return to Caracas in the middle of the
week with “good news.”  Chavez said doctors will perform an “integral review” of
his body to confirm the results of the first stage of cancer
treatment that included four rounds of chemotherapy. Chavez has
said tests showed no malignant cancer cells in his body.  “I thank God I’m on my feet and heading the government
after these four months of treatment,” Chavez said last night
from the Caracas airport in comments broadcast on state
television.  Chavez plans to fully recover from his undisclosed cancer
by year’s end to launch his campaign for a third consecutive
six-year term in elections scheduled for next October. Chavez’s
approval rating has risen 10 percentage points to 58.9 percent
since he announced that he had cancer, according to Caracas-
based polling firm  Datanalisis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
