The Texas Rangers are favored by Las
Vegas oddsmakers to beat the  St. Louis Cardinals  in the  World
Series  for the first championship in franchise history.  The Rangers are listed as -150 money line favorites at the
Las Vegas Hilton’s Race and Sports Book even though the
Cardinals hold home-field advantage for Major League Baseball’s
best-of-seven World Series. Bettors would have to wager $150 on
the Rangers to make a $100 profit, while a winning $100 bet on
the Cardinals at +120 would return $120.  The World Series begins Oct. 19 in St. Louis, where the
Cardinals would host four games if the series goes a full seven
games. The Rangers and Cardinals each opened the season with 20-
1 odds of winning the World Series, tied as the sixth favorites
among the league’s 30 teams.  “It’s the ultimate goal of our sport and now we have
another shot at it,” Rangers second baseman  Ian Kinsler  told
reporters.  The Rangers are back in the World Series after losing to
the  San Francisco Giants  in five games last year. Before last
season, Texas hadn’t won a postseason series since the team
relocated from  Washington  in 1972. The Rangers beat the Tampa
Bay Rays 3-1 in the opening round of this year’s postseason
before knocking out the Detroit Tigers 4-2 to win the American
League Championship Series.  The Cardinals have won 10 championships, with their most
recent coming in 2006. St. Louis ousted the 102-win Philadelphia
Phillies and then defeated the Milwaukee Brewers to capture the
National League Championship Series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
