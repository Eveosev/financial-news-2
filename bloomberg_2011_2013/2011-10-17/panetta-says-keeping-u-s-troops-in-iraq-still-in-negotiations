The U.S. still hopes to reach
agreement with the government of Iraq on keeping U.S. forces
there past the end of the year, Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
said today.  “At the present time, I’m not discouraged because we are
still in negotiations with the Iraqis,” Panetta told reporters
at the Pentagon.  To stay longer, the U.S. has insisted that its troops have
immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts. Iraq has not agreed
to that provision.  “Our hope is that the negotiators can ultimately find a
way to resolve this issue in terms of what are the Iraqi needs
and how can we best meet them,” Panetta said.  The current U.S. agreement with Iraq for keeping troops in
the country expires at year end. Units have been steadily
pulling out of the country.  If a new agreement is reached, the U.S. would leave troops
behind to help train  Iraq ’s security forces.  The U.S. currently has abut 41,000 troops in Iraq, down
from a peak of about 170,000.  Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in e-mailed
statement today that the U.S. has about 20 bases remaining, out
of 485 at the peak of the mission.  The withdrawal has been “considered a success for both
sides in implementing the joint commitments.” al-Dabbagh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
