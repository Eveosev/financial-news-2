European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said the central bank must be allowed to
remain credible in its defense of  price stability .  “We were faithful to our mandate. It is not an easy
mandate,” Trichet said in Vienna today when receiving a medal
from Austrian President Heinz Fischer. “It is extremely
important to see that in the next 10 years we are equally given
the credibility to deliver price stability.”  Trichet, whose eight-year term ends on Oct. 31, has been
forced to take the ECB into uncharted territory to battle the
euro region’s sovereign debt crisis as politicians procrastinate
over their response. Most controversially, the central bank has
been buying  government bonds  to reduce market interest rates, a
measure some policy makers say blurs the line between monetary
and fiscal policy.  “We are in demanding times,” Trichet said today. “A
number of sovereign signatories” have been “put into question,
and that creates challenges to stability.”  Trichet said the crisis is global and all major advanced
economies, including  Europe , the U.S. and  Japan , need to
“revise their strategies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
