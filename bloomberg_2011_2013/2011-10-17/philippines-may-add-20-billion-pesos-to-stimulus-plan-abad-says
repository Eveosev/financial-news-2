The Philippine government may
increase its budget for its stimulus plan by 20 billion pesos,
Budget Secretary Butch Abad told reporters today in  Manila .  The additional funds will be used to provide electricity to
remote provinces and the government will decide in November,
Abad said. The government likely had a  budget deficit  in
September, Abad said. The shortfall this year may be 240 billion
pesos without the additional stimulus, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
