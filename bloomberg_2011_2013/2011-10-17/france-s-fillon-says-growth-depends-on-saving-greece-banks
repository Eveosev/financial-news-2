Restoring growth in  Europe  depends
on making sure that  Greece  and any banks don’t fail, French
Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  said.  “If we can be convincing that Greece won’t fail, and we
won’t let it, and if we can can be convincing that we won’t let
banks fail, and we won’t because governments will show
solidarity, then we will see growth in 2012,” Fillon said in an
interview on France2 television.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
