Former Belgian Prime Minister  Guy Verhofstadt  urged a European approach to recapitalizing banks
and the creation of a common bond market for the euro region.  “We obviously need a European approach” to the banking
industry, Verhofstadt said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview. Policy makers should “create the same rules and the
same environment for all banks in  Europe , smaller and bigger
banks. That is necessary to create confidence between the
financial institutions in Europe,” he said.  Verhofstadt also supported the idea of common bond issuance
by the 17 countries that use the euro.  “The only stable solution for this euro crisis is the
creation of what I call a euro-bond market,” he said.
Proposals for insuring the bonds of distressed euro-area
governments would be “certainly a step toward” a common  bond
market , Verhofstadt said.  From there, “it’s only a little step to go to a real euro-
bond market, in which you mutualize the debt of the different
members of the euro zone,” Verhofstadt said. “The idea of a
euro-bond market is not to mutualize the whole debt of the euro
zone, but only a part of it -- the 60 percent that is allowed
under the rules of the treaty of Maastricht.”   To contact the reporter on this story:
