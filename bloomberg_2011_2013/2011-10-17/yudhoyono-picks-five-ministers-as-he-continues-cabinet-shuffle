Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has decided on at least five of the ministerial
positions in his cabinet as he prepares to announce the full
lineup tomorrow, the people who were chosen said.  Gita Wirjawan, head of the country’s investment
coordinating board, will replace Mari Pangestu as trade minister,
Wirjawan told reporters today during an unscheduled press
briefing at the presidential palace in Jakarta. Pangestu has
held the job since 2004, when Yudhoyono was elected to his first
term. Pangestu was in meetings and unavailable for comment, her
staff said.  Yudhoyono won a second five-year term with 61 percent of
the vote in 2009 on pledges to boost the economy, double
infrastructure spending and clean up graft. His public support
fell after the former treasurer of his Democrat party was
accused of corruption. Support for the president was at a record
low of 46.2 percent in the latest Jakarta-based  Indonesian
Survey Circle  poll, taken nationwide Oct. 5-10.  In June, the Corruption Eradication Commission named
Muhammad Nazaruddin as a suspect in a bribery case. He is
accused of accepting bribes associated with construction
projects for the Southeast Asia Games to be held in November. He
was arrested by Interpol in  Colombia  in August.  Nazaruddin said in an interview broadcast July 19 on Metro
TV that he fled the country because the investigation was
politically motivated.  Other Picks  Dahlan Iskan, president director of PT Perusahaan Listrik
Negara, was chosen to be state-owned enterprises minister,
replacing Mustafa Abubakar, Iskan said at the briefing.  Djan Faridz will become housing minister, he said at the
briefing. Suharso Monoarfa resigned from that position due to
the personal matters, Yudhoyono said at a separate press
briefing earlier today.  Azwar Abubakar becomes state apparatus empowerment minister,
replacing Evert Mangindaan, and Amir Syamsuddin replaces
Patrialis Akbar as law and human rights minister, Abubakar and
Syamsuddin said today.  Yudhoyono also asked Marciano Norman to become head of the
State Intelligence Agency, a cabinet-level position, replacing
Sutanto, Norman said.  The cabinet changes are ‘on time’ to respond the domestic
and global challenges on the next few years, Yudhoyono told
reporters on Oct. 13.  Yudhoyono also chose 13 deputy ministers.  “The placement of deputy minister is to improve the
quality of policy formulation process,” Daniel Sparringa, a
presidential spokesman said on Oct. 14. “They are very
necessary to generate synergies to enhance the organization in
each ministry.”  *T Ministers  Law and Human Rights Minister                Amir Syamsuddin
