The cost for European banks to
convert euro interest payments into dollars rose, reversing a
decline, as  Germany  damped expectations for a fast resolution to
the euro region’s debt crisis.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap  was 91 basis
points under the euro interbank offered rate as of 4:27 p.m. in
 London , from 90 at the end of last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The swap earlier fell to 87 basis points
below Euribor, the smallest gap in a month.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s chief spokesman Steffen
Seibert said at a briefing in Berlin today that European Union
leaders won’t provide the complete fix to the euro-area debt
crisis that global policy makers are pushing for at an Oct. 23
summit. European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said earlier that clarity on a strategy
will emerge in the “coming days.”  “Given that risk assets are close to the top of recent
ranges it probably doesn’t take much in the way of bad news, or
even a lack of good news, to trigger weakness,” Roger Francis,
a credit analyst at Mizuho International Plc in London, said in
an e-mail.  The one-year basis swap was 65 basis points below Euribor
from 63 on Oct. 14. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  rose. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was 76 basis
points from 74 on Oct. 14. The spread reached 89 basis points on
Sept. 23, the widest since March 2009.  ECB Deposits  Overnight deposits at the  European Central Bank  rose. Banks
parked 136 billion euros ($188 billion) at the Frankfurt-based
ECB on Oct. 14, up from 123 billion euros on Oct. 13. That
compares with a year-to-date average of 59 billion euros.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.578 percent from 1.574
percent on Oct. 14. One-week Euribor fell to 1.171 percent from
1.174 percent.  The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for the 27th day to 0.406 percent from 0.405
percent, according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest since Aug. 6, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was little
changed at 39 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
