French banks should be able to meet
higher  capital requirements  mostly through retained earnings,
Bank of  France  Governor  Christian Noyer  said.  They should be able to do it “essentially through retained
earnings,” Noyer told journalists in Paris.  Noyer also said the banks’ situation is different now than
it was in 2008 because they haven’t taken major losses. “The
big difference with two or three years ago is that we had losses
in banks, they had toxic assets,” he said. “Now we’re not
confronted with losses but with uncertainty in the markets.”  France’s banks have the capacity to absorb losses related
to a Greek default, he added. The lenders’ combined exposure to
sovereign debt in the euro area periphery is about 60 billion
euros and its exposure to Greek sovereign debt is 8 billion
euros, he said. They have combined tier 1 capital of 2010
billion euros, according to Noyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
