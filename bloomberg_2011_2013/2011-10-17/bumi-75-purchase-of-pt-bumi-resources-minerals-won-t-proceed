Bumi Plc, founded by  Nathaniel
Rothschild , said its proposed acquisition of 75 percent of PT
Bumi Resources Minerals from coal producer PT Bumi Resources
will not proceed because of continuing market uncertainties.  Jersey , Channel Islands-based Bumi made the announcement
today in a Regulatory News Service statement. Bumi Plc owns
29.18 percent of Bumi Resources, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Jakarta-based Bumi Resources controls 58.15 percent
of Bumi Minerals, according to the data.  Bumi Resources’ intent of ‘monetizing investments’
including in Bumi Minerals hasn’t changed,  Dileep Srivastava , a
director at Bumi Resources, said in a separate e-mailed
statement.  “This action ‘‘not to proceed’’ at this time is taken in
the best interest of all our Bumi Resources shareholders,”
Dileep said. Bumi Resources is Indonesia’s biggest coal
producer. The move will “avoid any risk of them being
disadvantaged because of the current volatile market
environment.”  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  has fallen 11 percent since its
Aug. 1 record high with shares of Bumi Minerals dropping 23
percent over the same period. The stock closed down 6.2 percent
at 610 rupiah in Jakarta.  To contact the reporters on this story:
