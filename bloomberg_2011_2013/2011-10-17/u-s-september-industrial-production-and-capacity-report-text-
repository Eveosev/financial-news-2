Following is the text of the U.S.
industrial production and capacity utilization report for
September released by the  Federal Reserve .  Industrial production increased 0.2 percent in September
after having been unchanged in August. Previously, industrial
production was reported to have stepped up 0.2 percent in August.
For the third quarter as a whole, industrial production rose at
an annual rate of 5.1 percent. Manufacturing output moved up 0.4
percent in September after having gained 0.3 percent in August.
Production at mines advanced 0.8 percent in September, while the
output of utilities decreased 1.8 percent. At 94.2 percent of
its 2007 average, total industrial production for September was
3.2 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity utilization
for total industry edged up to 77.4 percent, a rate 1.7
percentage points above its level from a year earlier but 3.0
percentage points below its long-run (1972-2010) average.  Market Groups  The output of  consumer goods  increased 0.1 percent in
September. The index for durable consumer goods rose 0.9
percent; gains in the production of automotive products, home
electronics, and miscellaneous goods more than offset a decline
in the output of appliances, furniture, and carpeting. The
production of nondurable consumer goods edged down 0.1 percent,
as a decrease in the index for consumer energy outweighed a rise
in the output of other nondurable consumer goods. The gain for
non-energy nondurables reflected higher output for food and
tobacco; the indexes for its other three major categories--
clothing, chemicals, and paper--all fell. For the third quarter,
the output of consumer goods increased at an annual rate of 3.7
percent after having decreased 1.6 percent in the second quarter.  In September, the production of business equipment rose 1.0
percent, its third consecutive gain of 1 percent or more, and
was 10.3 percent above its year-earlier level. The index for
transit equipment advanced 1.9 percent, the index for
information processing equipment moved up 1.4 percent, and the
production of industrial and other equipment increased 0.3
percent. For the third quarter, the output of business equipment
rose at an annual rate of 12.6 percent. The output of transit
equipment jumped 31.8 percent, the largest increase among the
major components of business equipment for the quarter. The
principal contributors to the gain were civilian aircraft and
trucks.  The production of defense and space equipment increased 1.2
percent in September after a similarly sized gain in August.  The index for construction supplies rose 0.2 percent in
September for its fifth consecutive monthly increase. In the
third quarter, the production of construction supplies advanced
at an annual rate of 6.3 percent, its largest quarterly increase
in more than a year. The production of business supplies moved
down 0.2 percent in September after having declined 0.4 percent
in August, but in the third quarter overall, output rose at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent. The output of materials to be
further processed in the industrial sector edged up 0.1 percent
in September after having recorded a 0.2 percent loss in August.
The index for durable materials increased 0.2 percent and was up
for a third consecutive month in September. Among the major
categories of durable materials, consumer parts rose 0.3 percent,
equipment parts increased 0.7 percent, and other  consumer
durables  fell slightly. Following a decrease of 0.6 percent in
August, the production of nondurable materials increased 0.4
percent in September, with gains in textile, paper, and chemical
materials partly offset by decreases for containers and
miscellaneous nondurable materials. The output of energy
materials edged down in September. For the third quarter, the
output of materials rose at an annual rate of 4.8 percent after
having been little changed in the second quarter.  Industry Groups  Manufacturing output increased 0.4 percent in September to
a level that was 3.9 percent higher than a year earlier. The
factory operating rate moved up to 75.1 percent, a rate 10.7
percentage points above its trough in June 2009, but still 3.9
percentage points below its long-run average.  The output of durable goods manufacturing increased 0.6
percent in September and was 7.9 percent above its year-earlier
level. Output gains of more than 2 percent were recorded in wood
products and in aerospace and miscellaneous transportation
equipment, while output gains of at least 1 percent were
recorded for computer and electronic products; electrical
equipment, appliances, and components; and miscellaneous
manufacturing. Production for four major components of durables
declined: nonmetallic mineral products, primary metals,
fabricated metal products, and furniture and related products.  The production index for nondurable manufacturing moved up
0.2 percent in September. Output rose at an annual rate of 1.0
percent in the third quarter after having declined by the same
amount in the second quarter. Among the major components of
nondurables, paper posted the largest increase in September, and
production rose slightly for food, beverage, and tobacco
products; chemicals; and plastics and rubber products. The
output of apparel and leather dropped 1.2 percent for its second
consecutive monthly decrease; the index for printing fell 0.5
percent and was 3.1 percent below its year-earlier level. The
index for other manufacturing (non-NAICS), which consists of
publishing and logging, decreased 0.7 percent in September.  Mining production increased 0.8 percent in September, and
gains were widespread among mined energy components. Capacity
utilization in mining rose to 91.3 percent, a rate 3.9
percentage points above its long-run average. The output of
utilities moved down 1.8 percent as temperatures in September
moderated following an unseasonably hot August. The operating
rate for utilities declined to 77.6 percent, a rate 9.0
percentage points below its long-run average.  Capacity utilization rates in September at industries by
stage of process were as follows: At the crude stage,
utilization increased 0.8 percentage point to 88.8 percent, a
rate 2.4 percentage points above its long-run average; at the
primary and semifinished stages, utilization moved down 0.4
percentage point to 73.9 percent, a rate 7.4 percentage points
below its long-run average; and at the finished stage,
utilization gained 0.2 percentage point to 76.7 percent, a rate
0.6 percentage point below its long-run average.  REFERENCES AND RELEASE DATES
