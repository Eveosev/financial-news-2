Latvia, which had a budget deficit
of almost 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, should
plan to cut its deficit more than planned this year and balance
it in 2013, central bank Governor Ilmars Rimsevics said.  The country is planning a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP
next year, but “an optimal one would be 2 percent, and in 2013
would be good if the budget was balanced,” Rimsevics said on
Latvian Television program 900 Seconds today.  “Latvia has to be ready for a second wave of the crisis,”
he said on television. “For Latvia to be ready we would need a
balanced budget or a budget with a surplus” in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
