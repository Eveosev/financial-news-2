China ’s CSI 300 Index may rally to
3,300 over the next 12 months, as low valuations lure investors
and the government signals the end of monetary tightening,
according to Manop Sangiambut, CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets’ head
of China A-share research.  “I am on the positive side of Chinese stocks, mainly
because of valuations and because we’re at the tail end of
tightening policies,” Sangiambut said in an interview in
 Shanghai  today. He favors Chinese brokerages, machinery
companies and coal producers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
