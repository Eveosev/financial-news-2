Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned
oil company, reopened a second crude-export terminal in the Gulf
of Mexico after weather conditions improved.  The terminal at the port of Dos Bocas reopened, Mexico’s
Merchant Marine said in a weather  bulletin  on its website today.
Mexico closed the oil ports of Dos Bocas and Cayo Arcas Oct. 15.
Cayo Arcas reopened earlier today, while Coatzacoalcos remained
open.  Pemex, the second-largest supplier of oil to the U.S.,
exported 1.361 million barrels of crude a day in 2010. About 84
percent, or 1.139 million barrels, was sold to the U.S. last
year, according to Pemex statistics. Canada is the largest
supplier of crude to the U.S.  Cayo Arcas is the Mexico City-based company’s largest
export terminal, followed by Coatzacoalcos and  Dos Bocas ,
respectively.  Crude oil for November delivery declined 0.5 percent to
settle at $86.38 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The Oct. 14 closing price of $86.80 was the highest since Sept.
