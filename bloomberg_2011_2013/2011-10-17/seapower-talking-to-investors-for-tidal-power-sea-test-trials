SeaPower Gen Ltd., a U.K. maker of
tidal current turbines, is talking to industrial partners and
wealthy investors about raising 25 million pounds ($39 million)
within two years to complete sea trials.  The Southampton-based company aims to raise 1 million
pounds by year-end, SeaPower founder and Chief Executive Officer
Donald Bent said in an e-mail. It’s looking for 5 million pounds
next year and the rest in 2013, he said.  Energy from the waves and tides has the potential to meet
as much as 20 percent of the current U.K. electricity demand,
according to the  government . SeaPower’s technology harnesses
energy from tidal currents to produce electricity.  SeaPower is targeting high net-worth individuals and
industrial partners to raise the money, Bent said. It’s speaking
with three prospects based in Bristol, Devon and the Isle of
Wight. One is an engineering aerospace company, he said, another
is a marine composite company and the other is a supplier of
armored vehicles to the Ministry of Defence.  The company will use the first funds to complete tank
testing of a quarter-scale prototype of its device with QinetiQ
Group Plc. It’s planning to install a full-scale version off the
Anglesey coast in  Wales  for testing in 2014.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
