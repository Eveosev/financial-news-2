Public Bank Bhd. (PBK) , Malaysia’s third-
biggest lender, said third-quarter profit increased 15 percent,
driven by higher net interest income and investing banking fees.  Net income rose to 898.8 million ringgit ($288 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30, from 782.7 million ringgit a
year earlier, the Kuala Lumpur-based lender said in an exchange
filing today. Revenue climbed 14 percent to 3.3 billion ringgit.  “We continue to see the group’s business performance to be
in line with expectations and on track in meeting the key
business targets of 2011,” Public Bank’s founder and Chairman
Teh Hong Piow said in a separate e-mailed statement, adding that
the outlook for the industry is “stable and supportive of
growth.”  Malaysia ’s economy has continued to expand, after growing
7.2 percent last year, the most in a decade. Gross domestic
product may increase by as much 5.5 percent in 2011, the  finance
ministry  said in a report on Oct. 7. Public Bank, which has 250
local branches, generates more than 90 percent of its revenue
domestically, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Public Bank said return-on-equity was 26.7 percent, the
highest among Malaysian financial institutions tracked by
Bloomberg.  Net interest income, or revenue from borrowers after
deducting interest paid to depositors, rose 7 percent during the
period to 1.3 billion ringgit. Fee and commission income
increased 13 percent to 290.1 million ringgit, and earnings from
Islamic banking expanded 18 percent to 229.9 million ringgit,
the filing said.  The group’s shares were unchanged at 12.50 ringgit at the
12:30 p.m. trading break in  Kuala Lumpur , before the earnings
announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
