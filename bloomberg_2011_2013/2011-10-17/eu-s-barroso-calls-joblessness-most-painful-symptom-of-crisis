European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  called unemplopyment the “most painful” symptom of the
debt crisis and pledged to “press hard” to boost jobs in the
region.  “The steep rise in joblessness across our union is the
most painful social symptom of this economic crisis,” Barroso
said today in a statement in Brussels. Barroso and European
Union President Herman van Rompuy are meeting today with labor
and employer leaders in Brussels.  “I want our next country-specific recommendations to
address the plight of young people in every one of our Member
States,” Barroso said in the statement. “We will also continue
to press hard for reforms to remove structural obstacles to
employment. The roadmap we have presented ahead of the European
Council also proposes growth-enhancing measures capable of
creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
