The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency said it won’t tighten air-pollution controls on
agriculture, construction or demolition work, after farmers and
lawmakers complained that it was ready to outlaw farm dust.  EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said in a letter to Senator
 Debbie Stabenow , a Michigan Democrat and chairwoman of the
Senate Agriculture Committee, that she would propose keeping the
current standard for particulate-matter pollution.  “I’m pleased the administration heeded my call to back off
of increasing regulation on farm dust so that farmers can keep
doing their jobs,” Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said
today in a statement in response to Jackson’s letter.  EPA had never proposed tightening rules on farm dust, and
the agency said lawmakers were raising concerns based on a myth
about the rulemaking.  Senator Mike Johanns, a Nebraska Republican, and other
lawmakers proposed legislation to prevent the EPA from forcing
farmers to curb dust in the air when they farm.  In her letter dated Oct. 14, Jackson said that she decided
to keep the 1987 dust standard in place after a review of the
science, an analysis by agency scientists and recommendations
from an outside advisory panel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
