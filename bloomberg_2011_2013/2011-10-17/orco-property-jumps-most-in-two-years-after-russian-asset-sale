Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA climbed the
most in two years after the developer in central  Europe  said it
completed a divestment that will help reduce the company’s debt.  The stock rose as much as 20 percent, its biggest intraday
increase since October 2009, and traded up 11 percent to 4.33
euros by 3:49 p.m. in Paris. In Prague, Orco advanced 7 percent
to 107 koruna, poised for its biggest gain since Aug. 15.  Orco said today it completed a sale of assets in Russia for
about 53 million euros ($73 million). The Luxembourg-registered
company, which is reorganizing its business and debt under a
court-approved plan, is raising cash to refinance a 300 million-
euro loan and 100 million euros of bonds at its German unit.  “We regard the news as slightly positive for the stock
price,” Ondrej Moravansky, an analyst at Cyrrus brokerage in
Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in a report today. “The move is
part of Orco’s strategy to focus more on activities in central
Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
