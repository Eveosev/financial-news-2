The ruble slid against the dollar
after its best weekly advance since 2009 as hope for a swift end
to  Europe ’s debt crisis ebbed, reducing investor appetite for
riskier emerging-market assets.  The Russian currency dropped 0.1 percent to 30.9050 per
dollar by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, erasing an earlier advance
of 0.9 percent. The ruble added 3.7 percent versus the greenback
last week, its strongest gain since February 2009. It was 0.7
percent stronger at 42.57 per euro, leaving it up 0.3 percent at
36.1543 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Emerging-market stocks and currencies pared gains after
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s chief spokesman said today an
Oct. 23 deadline for a plan to ease the region’s problems won’t
bring a swift resolution to the crisis.  “We haven’t really seen any tangible policy changes or
sustained upward economic trend,” Peter Rosenstreich, chief
currency analyst at Swissquote Bank SA in Geneva, said by e-
mail.  Investors increased bets the Russian currency will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards today showing it at
31.4274 per dollar in three months’ time, compared with 31.3638
per dollar Oct. 14.  Russia’s dollar bonds due 2020 climbed for a ninth day,
pushing the yield down ten basis points, or 0.10 percentage
point, to 4.68 percent. Dollar notes due 2015 yielded eight
basis points less than on Oct. 14, at 3.322 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
