Cia. Hering,  Brazil ’s second-biggest
clothing retailer, led gains on the benchmark Bovespa index
after reporting a 35 percent increase in third-quarter sales and
bigger expansion plans.  Shares rose 2.4 percent to 32.61 reais at 1:18 p.m. Sao
Paulo time, the best performance among the 68 members on the
gauge. The Bovespa declined 2 percent.  “The consistent outperformance of Hering’s business and
the upward revision of its expansion plan leave us comfortable
with our forecasts and even opens some room for an upward
revision,” Itau Corretora de Valores SA analysts Juliana Rozenbaum and Francine Martins wrote in a note to clients today.
Itau has a 12-month share price estimate of 42.70 reais.  Hering increased to 86 from 71 the number of stores it
plans to open in Brazil this year, according to a regulatory
filing Oct. 14.  The retailer also reported a 9 percent increase in its
third-quarter same-store sales, trailing a 12 percent jump
forecast by Itau. The growth in total sales “more than
compensated for the weaker-than-expected” same-store figures,
according to Rozenbaum and Martins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
