Senate Democrats will push
legislation to provide $30 billion for schools and $5 billion
for police, firefighters and first responders, Majority Leader
 Harry Reid  said today.  The measure would help local governments avoid layoffs or
rehire about 400,000 teachers and support staff, Reid of  Nevada 
said on the Senate floor. President Barack Obama today urged
Congress to pass such a proposal as an element of his jobs plan
blocked by the Senate last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
