A new generation of commodity
exchange-traded funds may become a “key diversifier” for
investors, according to  Societe Generale  SA.  Nizam Hamid, head of ETF strategy at Societe Generale’s
corporate and investment-banking unit, commented at a conference
in  London  today.  “We see more intelligent, third-generation indices in the
commodities space as being one of the key trends moving forward,
as investors look for better ways to gain access to difficult-
to-trade products. And in this case, we see commodities as the
key diversifier for many clients’ portfolios.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
