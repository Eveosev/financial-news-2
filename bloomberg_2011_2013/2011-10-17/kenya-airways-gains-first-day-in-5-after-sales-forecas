Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  gained for the
first day in a week after  Business Daily  reported sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-largest airline forecast increased sales in the
year through March.  The stock advanced 3.8 percent to 25 shillings by 2:24 p.m.
in Nairobi.  The airline’s revenue will climb to 120 billion shillings
($1.2 billion) on increased demand in Africa and  Asia , the
Nairobi-based newspaper cited Chief Executive Officer Titus Naikuni as saying. A weaker shilling will also raise the
airline’s revenue, he told Business Daily.  The shilling has depreciated 20 percent against the dollar
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In June, the
airline said sales in the 12 months to March 2011 were 85.8
billion shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
