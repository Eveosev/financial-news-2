The outlook for German economic
growth has worsened further as companies cut their business
expectations and foreign orders decline, the Bundesbank said
today in its monthly report.  “Businesses have again scaled back their expectations and
the inflow of new orders, especially from abroad, has lessened
noticeably,” the Frankfurt-based central bank said. Industrial
companies will find it “difficult” to maintain output over the
next six months amid weaker demand, it said.  The slowdown will come after a “strong” increase in gross
domestic product in the third quarter thanks to a rebound in
industrial production and private consumption from the previous
quarter, when the economy came to a near standstill, the
Bundesbank said. It currently forecasts growth of about 3
percent this year for  Europe ’s largest economy, which expanded
1.3 percent in the first three months of 2011.  The upswing in the German labor market is continuing even
as manufacturing faces a slowdown, the Bundesbank said, citing
an Ifo economic institute measure of hiring intentions and the
Federal Labor Agency’s BA-X employment index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
