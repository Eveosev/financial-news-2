General Electric Co. (GE)  paid $3.3
billion today to repurchase preferred stock sold to Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  as financial markets froze in
October 2008.  A GE spokesman, Kenny Juarez, confirmed the payment in an
interview. Steven Winoker of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. and
other analysts expect GE to show an $800 million reduction in
retained earnings when the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company
reports third-quarter results on Oct. 21.  Buffett’s purchase of the shares, callable after three
years at a 10 percent premium, helped Chief Executive Officer
 Jeffrey Immelt  raise an additional $12 billion from public
markets two weeks after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for
bankruptcy. GE disclosed its planned repayment date last month
in a U.S. regulatory filing.  Buying back the stake was a priority for Immelt and Chief
Financial Officer Keith Sherin, who told investors in July that
GE is concentrating on repurchasing common shares and increasing
its dividend.  For Buffett, the redemption of the shares means an end to
the 10 percent annual dividend, or $300 million, that GE paid
Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire. Buffett didn’t respond to a
request for comment e-mailed to his assistant,  Carrie Kizer .  To contact the reporters on this story:
