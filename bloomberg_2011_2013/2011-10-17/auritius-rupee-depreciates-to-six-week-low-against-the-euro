Mauritius’s rupee depreciated to an
almost six-week low against the euro, the currency of its main
trading partner.  The currency retreated as much as 1.5 percent to 40.4899,
its weakest intraday level since Sept. 6, and traded 1 percent
down at 40.2905 by 2:06 p.m. in  Port Louis , the capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the dollar, the
rupee dropped 0.6 percent to 29.12.  Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation of 1.3 million
people, is a net importer of food and fuels.  Europe  is the
nation’s main source of tourist arrivals and largest buyer of
manufactured goods, data from Statistics Mauritius show. The
euro represents 41 percent of total foreign-currency earnings,
the Bank of Mauritius said, while the dollar accounts for 67
percent of import bills.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.9688 rupees to
28.1374 and the selling price dropped to 29.474 compared with
29.5407 on Oct. 14, according to  exchange rates  published today
on the Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
