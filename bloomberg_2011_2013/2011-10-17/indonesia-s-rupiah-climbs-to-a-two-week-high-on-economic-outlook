Indonesia ’s rupiah rose, trading at
the strongest level in two weeks, after global funds boosted
holdings of the nation’s assets to benefit from a strengthening
local economy. Bonds climbed.  Overseas investors bought $218 million more Indonesian
shares than they sold last week, according to exchange data.
Growth in gross domestic product may quicken to at least 6.4
percent this year, Trade Minister Mari Pangestu said Oct. 15,
from 6.1 percent in 2010. The rupiah gained for a third day
after finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations endorsed
part of a plan to contain  Europe ’s debt crisis over the weekend.  “Funds are coming in as Indonesia’s economic-growth story
is intact,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. in Singapore. “The market has stabilized somewhat
as the central bank is consistently intervening. The general
tone is of optimism over the G-20 statement.”  The rupiah rose 0.3 percent to 8,819 against the dollar as
of 4 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
complied by Bloomberg. That was the strongest level since Sept.
30.  Bank Indonesia  is selling dollars when needed to ease
exchange-rate volatility, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said
Oct. 7.  G-20 finance ministers and central banks agreed on an
emergency plan to avoid a debt default by  Greece  and set an Oct.
23 summit of European leaders in Brussels as the deadline for it
to be delivered.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 10-year bond fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to a record low of
6.31 percent today, prices compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Foreign ownership of the nation’s debt rose to 217.3
trillion rupiah ($24.6 billion) on Oct. 13, from 212.5 trillion
on Oct. 7, according to data from the finance ministry’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
