Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX)  dropped
7.4 percent after estimates showed sales of its hepatitis C drug
Incivek declined in the past two weeks.  Vertex, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, fell to $40.09
at 4 p.m. New York time. IMS Health Inc., a prescription-data
company, said total sales of Incivek “hit a peak” in the week
of Sept. 23 and declined in each of the past two weeks,  Jason Kantor , an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in  San Francisco  said
in a note.  Vertex rose the most in two months on Oct. 13 after IMS
said its figures for the last two weeks of September were
adjusted based on estimates to account for missing data. IMS
today revised the estimates for the last two weeks in September
upward 4.9 percent and 4.3 percent, Kantor said in the note.
Data for new prescription sales has not been updated.  “Bottom line is that the recent weeks of IMS data neither
confirm nor rule out the potential that Incivek continues to
grow,” Kantor wrote.  The controversy likely will continue until Vertex reports
its third-quarter earnings Oct. 27, he said.  Incivek competes with Victrelis, a medicine made by
 Whitehouse Station , New Jersey-based Merck & Co. that was also
approved for sale earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
