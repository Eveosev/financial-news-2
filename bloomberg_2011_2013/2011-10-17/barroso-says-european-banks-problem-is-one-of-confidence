The problems facing European banks
result from a lack of confidence, European Commission President
Jose Manuel Barroso said.  “European banks for the most part are sound but there is a
mistrust because of their holdings of sovereign debt,” Barroso
said in an interview with  France ’s BFM Radio that was taped over
the weekend and ran today.  Banks needing to recapitalize should go to private markets,
to their national government, and to European rescue funds, in
that order.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
