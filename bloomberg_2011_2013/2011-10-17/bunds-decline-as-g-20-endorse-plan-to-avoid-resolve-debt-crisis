German 10-year bund yields were
within five basis points of a six-week high as investors mulled
the Group of 20’s endorsement of a plan to resolve the euro
area’s debt crisis and avoid a Greek default.  German two-year notes were little changed even as Asian and
European stocks rallied. G-20 officials concluded weekend talks
in Paris by setting an Oct. 23 summit of European leaders in
Brussels as the deadline for completing a plan to avoid a Greek
default, bolster banks and curb contagion to larger economies in
the 17-nation region. Greek two-year notes fell.  “There’s some expectation that they will have a final
plan, especially for” the European bailout fund at the summit,
said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior interest-rates strategist at
ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “That should help risky assets
compared to the level of bund yields.”  German 10-year yields were little changed at 2.20 percent
at 11:03 a.m. London time, after climbing to 2.25 percent, the
highest since Sept. 1. The 2.25 percent security due September
2021 traded at 100.40. Two-year notes yielded 0.66 percent.  The Greek two-year note yield climbed 89 basis points to
75.03 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
