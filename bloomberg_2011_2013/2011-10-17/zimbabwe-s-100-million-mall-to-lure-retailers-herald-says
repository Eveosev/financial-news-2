A $100 million shopping mall in
 Zimbabwe ’s capital, Harare, may attract foreign retailers to the
city, the state-controlled  Herald  said.  Construction of the mall will begin next year and take 16
months, the Harare-based Herald said on its website, citing
Jason McCormick, managing director of closely held McCormick
Property Development, which is involved in the building. About
53 percent of the mall has already been booked by retailers such
as South Africa’s  Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK)  and its South African
competitor, the Spar Group Ltd., the Herald said.  The shopping complex, to be known as the Mall of Zimbabwe,
will be the biggest in Africa outside of South Africa, the
newspaper said. It will be built in the capital’s affluent
Borrowdale suburb.  South Africa ’s Spar Group will compete with about 80 stores
run by Spar Zimbabwe, which split from the South African company
in 1966.  To contact the reporter on this story:
