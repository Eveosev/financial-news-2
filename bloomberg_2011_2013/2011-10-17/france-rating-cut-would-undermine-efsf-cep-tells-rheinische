The structure of the European rescue
fund would be undermined if  France  were to lose its AAA credit
rating,  Rheinische Post  reported, citing Lueder Gerken, head of
the Centre for European Policy, a Freiburg, Germany-based think
tank.  A cut in the rating would decrease the capacity of the
European Financial Stability Facility by 35 percent, the
newspaper said, citing calculations by the CEP. Germany would
have to increase its guarantees to the EFSF to 317 billion euros
($436 billion) from 211 billion euros,  Rheinische Post  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
