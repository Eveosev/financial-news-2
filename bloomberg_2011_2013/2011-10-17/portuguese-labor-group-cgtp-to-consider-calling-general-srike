Portuguese labor group CGTP will
consider a proposal to call a general strike, said Manuel
Carvalho da Silva, the CGTP’s secretary-general.  Carvalho da Silva spoke at a press conference in Lisbon
with Joao Proenca, who heads the UGT labor group. The two
organizations on Oct. 19 will be able to announce a date for the
strike, Proenca said.  UGT and CGTP are  Portugal ’s two largest labor groups and in
November last year organized the country’s first general strike
in 22 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
