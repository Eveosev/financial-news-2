The 302-room Fairmont Miramar Hotel,
in the Los Angeles suburb of  Santa Monica , was bought by  Michael
Dell , the founder of computer maker Dell Inc., in 2006.  Dell structured the purchase of the ocean-view hotel to 
avoid the automatic tax increase that comes with the acquisition
of more than a 50 percent interest in any property, Los Angeles 
County officials said in a court filing. (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 00:38
