A U.S. district judge said he would
take over a lawsuit by the liquidator of  Bernard Madoff ’s firm
against investor Gerald Blumenthal to decide whether a trustee
could demand return of payments made by the confidence man’s
brokerage to its clients, according to a court filing.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said he would take about 30
related suits out of bankruptcy court as well, “to the extent
that the 31 cases that joined Blumenthal” raised the same
issues. A bankruptcy judge could rule on remaining issues,
Rakoff said in the Oct. 14 filing in Manhattan federal court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
