The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt erased its declines after  Germany 
said policy makers won’t come up with a complete fix to the debt
crisis at this weekend’s summit.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on
125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose 1.75 basis
points to 174.75, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 4:30 p.m.
in London, after earlier falling to as low as 167. An increase
signals a deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Steffen Seibert, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief
spokesman, said that the search for an end to the crisis that
has forced three countries to seek international bailouts will
extend into 2012. Credit markets rallied earlier after Group of
20 finance ministers and central banks concluded weekend talks
in Paris by setting an Oct. 23 deadline for a plan to bolster
banks and curb contagion.  “Markets continue to expect too much,” Marchel
Alexandrovich, an economist at Jefferies International Ltd. in
 London , said in an e-mail. “We’ve been here before where
expectations get too unrealistic and take a hit. The markets are
realizing that the European crisis won’t get resolved in a
week’s time after all.”  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index linked to 50 European
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 0.5
basis point to 740, after earlier declining to 709, JPMorgan
prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior
debt of 25 banks and insurers rose 1.5 basis points to 243.5,
while the subordinated gauge pared its drop, falling 10 basis
points to 470.  Sovereign Risk  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments dropped two basis points to 334.5, also paring its
decline.  Credit-default swaps protecting Irish debt fell 10 basis
points to 748, contracts on  Italy  slipped nine basis points to
442,  Portugal  dropped 34 basis points to 1,107, and  Spain  was
five basis points lower at 377, according to CMA.  Swaps on  France  were little changed at 182, Germany
declined three basis points to 92 and Belgium fell from a
record, dropping 14 basis points to 296, CMA prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
