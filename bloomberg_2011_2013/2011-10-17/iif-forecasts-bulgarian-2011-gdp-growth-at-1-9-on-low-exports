Bulgaria ’s economy will expand at a
slower pace than government’s estimates until 2014 as the euro-
area debt crisis cuts demand for exports from the Balkan nation,
the  Institute of International Finance  said.  Gross domestic product will slow to 1.9 percent in 2011,
2.2 percent in 2012, 2.5 percent in 2013 and 3 percent in 2014,
the Washington D.C.-based institute said in a report, e-mailed
by the  Finance Ministry  in Sofia today.  “Assuming the sovereign-debt crisis in the Eurozone is
resolved in an orderly manner, real GDP should increase roughly
2 percent both this year and next,” according to the report.
“A poor global growth outlook and increased risk aversion have
greatly increased uncertainty. Even so, Bulgaria appears more
resilient than many in the region.”  Bulgaria, the  European Union’s  poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, weathered the global crisis without
borrowing from international lenders. Bulgaria relies on exports
to fuel growth, after its economy contracted 5.5 percent in 2009
and grew 0.2 percent in 2010. The EU buys some 60 percent of
Bulgaria’s exports.  The government previously cut its 2012 forecast to 2.5
percent, leaving this year’s estimate of 3.6 percent unchanged
so far. The government’s April estimates for 2013 and 2014 are
4.4 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively.  “While the heavily export-dependent economy would
undoubtedly be strongly affected by sustained output weakness in
 Europe , it appears much less vulnerable to shifts in  market
sentiment  given its small government deficit and debt, current-
account surpluses and the absence of large refinancing needs
until 2013, when a $1 billion Eurobond falls due,” the IIF
said.  Bulgaria runs a currency board system, which is based on a
lev-euro peg, bans central bank lending and requires the lev in
circulation to match foreign-exchange reserves. The system helps
keep public debt at around 16 percent of GDP for 2011, below the
EU limit of 60 percent. The budget deficit is forecast to narrow
to 2 percent of GDP this year from 3.9 percent in 2010,
according to the IIF report.  Budget Deficit  The 2011 gap will be less than the government’s earlier
estimate of 2.5 percent, while the 2012 shortfall will drop
below 1.5 percent, Finance Minister  Simeon Djankov  said on Oct.
14. The ministry will unveil its 2012 budget outline later this
month, he said.  Greek-owned banks, which have about 30 percent of the
country’s banking assets, are not a risk because they are
incorporated as local banks, are well capitalized, regulated and
supervised by the central bank, the IIF said.  The assets of the  banking department  at the central bank,
at nearly 3 billion euros ($4.2 billion), “should be more than
sufficient to provide liquidity to these banks if needed,” it
said.  Classified loans in Bulgaria rose to 13.5 percent of total
lending in July from 11.9 percent at the end of 2010, fueled by
“weak economic activity and falling employment,” the institute
said. Banks are well capitalized with the aggregate capital
adequacy ratio little changed since last year at 17.4 percent of
risk-weighted assets, it said.  Bulgaria’s health-care and pension systems, which “remain
costly and inefficient and are plagued by misuse and fraud,”
are in need of an overhaul, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
