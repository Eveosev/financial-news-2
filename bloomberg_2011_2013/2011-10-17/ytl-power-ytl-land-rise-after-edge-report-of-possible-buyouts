YTL Power International Bhd. (YTLP)  and YTL
Land and Development Bhd. rose in Kuala Lumpur trading after the
Edge newspaper reported that they may be bought out by parent
YTL Corp. as part of a restructuring.   YTL Power climbed 4.9 percent to 1.93 ringgit at 9:47 a.m.
local time, set for its steepest gain since Aug. 11. YTL Land
jumped 10 percent to 1.17 ringgit, the most since Jan. 14. There
is speculation that YTL may have hired banks to work on a
possible “corporate exercise,” the Edge reported, without
citing anyone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
