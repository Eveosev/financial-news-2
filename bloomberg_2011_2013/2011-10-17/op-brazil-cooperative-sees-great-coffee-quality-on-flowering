Brazil ’s next coffee crop, the
world’s largest, is expected to be “great” quality after trees
developed well last week, the country’s top cooperative said.  “Flowering was quite intense, quite impressive,” last
week, Mario Ferraz, director at Cooperativa Regional de
Cafeicultores em Guaxupe Ltda. said today in a telephone
interview from Guaxupe, Brazil. “Flowering suggests we are
having great quality this year.”  Coffee output in Brazil, also the world’s top exporter, may
rise to between 57.5 million to 60 million bags next year, from
47.5 million this year, Comexim Ltda, a Brazilian coffee
exporter, said Oct. 13. Dry weather forecast for the next couple
of weeks will also help the beans’ development, he said.
Brazil’s next coffee harvest is expected to start by May.  Cooxupe’s 12,000 growers produce about 13 percent of
Brazil’s arabica coffee. A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms
(132 pounds).  Coffee trees can have multiple rounds of blossoming in a
single season, depending on rainfall. Cooxupe expects a second
and final flowering period in December, according to Ferraz.  Arabica coffee for December delivery fell as much as 11.2
cents, or 4.7 percent, to $2.2835 a pound at 11:01 a.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . Prices fell the most since Sept. 22.  Latin America ’s largest economy accounts for about 30
percent of global coffee exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
