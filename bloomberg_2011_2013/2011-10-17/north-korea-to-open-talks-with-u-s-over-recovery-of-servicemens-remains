The U.S. and  North Korea  will start
talks in Bangkok tomorrow on resuming recovery of remains of
American service members missing in action from the Korean War
of 1950 to 1953.  The talks, led for the U.S. by Robert J. Newberry, deputy
assistant secretary of defense for  POW/missing personnel
affairs , will only address the issue of resuming remains
recovery. It is a “stand-alone humanitarian matter,” the
Pentagon said today in an e-mailed statement.  The talks follow the North Korean government’s agreement in
August to a U.S. proposal for starting negotiations on recovery
operations. About 83,000 Americans are missing from previous
conflicts, including more than 7,900 from the Korean War. Of
those, 5,500 are believed to be missing in North Korea, the
Defense Department said.  Among the most recent remains identified from the  Korean
War  were those of Corporal Theodore A. Reynolds of the Army’s
8th cavalry regiment, 1st cavalry division. He was lost on Nov.
2, 1950, in North Korea.  Other U.S. and North Korean negotiators will meet in Geneva
next week to discuss how to resume stalled six-nation talks over
the communist nation’s nuclear weapons program,  South Korea ’s
