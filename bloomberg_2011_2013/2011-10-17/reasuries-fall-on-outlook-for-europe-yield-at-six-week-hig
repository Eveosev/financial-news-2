Treasuries gained, pushing 10-year
yields down from the highest level in seven weeks, as concern
 Europe  may take longer to contain its sovereign debt turmoil
boosted demand for the safest assets.  Thirty-year bonds erased a drop after German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s chief spokesman said “dreams” of an imminent
resolution to the crisis aren’t likely to be fulfilled at an
Oct. 23 summit. Manufacturing in New York, northern New Jersey
and southern  Connecticut  contracted faster than forecast, the
Empire State Index showed.  “The market will stay very schizophrenic until there is a
real concrete plan in hand in Europe,” said  Adrian Miller ,
fixed-income strategist at Miller Tabak Roberts Securities LLC
in New York. “The negative risk sentiment tied to Europe is
dominating everything and driving Treasuries higher.
Expectations of a resolution have been far overblown.”  Yields on 10-year notes tumbled nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 2.16 percent at 5:06 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yields earlier
rose to 2.29 percent, the highest level since Aug. 29. The price
of the 2.125 percent securities due in August 2021 increased
26/32, or $8.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 23/32.  Thirty-year bond yields slid 10 basis points to 3.13
percent after rising earlier to 3.29 percent, the highest level
since Sept. 16.  European Bonds Gain  European  government bonds  also gained, pushing yields down.
Yields on  Germany ’s 10-year securities dropped 10 basis points,
the most this month, to 2.10 percent after earlier rising to
2.25 percent. The U.K.’s 10-year note yields fell eight basis
points to 2.53 percent.  Stocks and the euro tumbled. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index dropped 1.9 percent. The euro weakened 1 percent to
$1.3738.  The Fed Bank of New York’s general economic index was at
minus 8.5 this month, compared with minus 8.8 in September.
Economists projected an improvement to minus 4, based on the
median of 53 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Readings less
than zero signal companies in the Empire State Index, covering
New York, northern  New Jersey , and southern Connecticut, are
cutting back.  Industrial production in the U.S. increased 0.2 percent, in
line with the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey, after
being little changed in August, Fed data showed.  ‘Muddle Along’  “The data we’ve seen over the last two weeks or so has
provided some encouragement that the economy is not heading into
a recession, but it’s still obvious that the data  doesn’t show
great strength either, so we will continue to muddle along,”
said Thomas Simons, a government debt economist in New York at
Jefferies Group Inc., one of 22 primary dealers that trade with
the U.S. central bank.  Treasuries fell earlier after Group of 20 finance ministers
and central bankers concluded weekend talks in Paris endorsing
parts of an emerging plan to avoid a Greek default, bolster
banks and curb contagion. They set European leaders’ Oct. 23
summit in Brussels as the deadline for it to be delivered.  Merkel has made it clear that “dreams that are taking hold
again now that with this package everything will be solved and
everything will be over on Monday won’t be able to be
fulfilled,” Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s chief spokesman, said at
a briefing in Berlin today. The search for an end to the crisis
“surely extends well into next year.”  “The market is going to make them prove that they can
implement the plan,” said Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader
in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc.  Monthly Drop  Treasuries were headed for the biggest monthly decline
since December 2010, losing 1.2 percent in October, compared
with a 0.8 percent drop in an index of global sovereign
securities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  The difference between U.S. two- and 10-year note yields
widened earlier to 2.02 percentage points, the most since Sept.
1, before dropping to 1.89 percentage points. The gap touched a
2011 low of 1.48 percentage points on Oct. 4 and a high of 2.93
on Feb. 7.  Treasuries due in six to 11 years may outperform in a rally
as primary dealers already own large amounts of longer-maturity
bonds, according to the primary dealer BNP Paribas SA.  Primary dealers held $14.3 billion of  U.S. debt  on Oct. 5
maturing in more than 11 years, according to data from the New
York Fed. That’s the most since May 20, 2009. Holdings of debt
due between six and 11 years were $879 million on Oct. 5.  Fed Sale  The Fed sold $1.37 billion in Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities today as part of the plan to lower borrowing costs
that’s become known as Operation Twist. Under the program, the
central bank is selling holdings of shorter-term maturities in
its portfolio for longer-term ones. The debt sold today was due
from July 2013 to July 2014, the New York Fed’s website showed.  The central bank will buy $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion
tomorrow of Treasuries due from February 2036 to August 2041.  The yield gap between two-year Treasury index-linked bonds
and nominal securities, a gauge known as the break-even rate of
trader expectations for inflation over the term of the
securities, widened to 127 basis points from this year’s low of
81 basis points on Aug. 18. The 10-year rate expanded to 205
basis points on Oct. 11, the most since Sept. 6, and was at 195
basis points today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
