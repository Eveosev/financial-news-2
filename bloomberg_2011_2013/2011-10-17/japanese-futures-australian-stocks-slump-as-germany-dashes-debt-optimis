Japanese stocks dropped amid the
lowest trading volume since December as  Germany  damped
expectations for a fast resolution to Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis and  China’s economy  grew at the slowest pace in two years.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,  Japan ’s largest lender
by market value, dropped 1.8 percent.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, slipped 1.7 percent. Olympus Corp., which
has lost $3.8 billion in market value in the three trading
sessions after ousting its president, fell 8.9 percent.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropped 1.6 percent to
8,741.91 at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo , its steepest decline in
two weeks. The broader Topix index fell 1.4 percent to 751.24
after a spokesman for German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
Europe won’t provide a quick fix to the debt crisis.  “The negotiations on haircuts for holders of Greek bonds
and the recapitalization of the banks isn’t going to be straight
forward,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based
SMBC Friend Securities Co. “Right now, whatever happens in
 Europe  determines what happens in the market.”  The Topix tumbled 16 percent this year amid concern the U.S.
would fall into another recession while Europe’s crisis
threatens to spread to the banking system. The slide has cut the
price of shares on the index to 0.9 times estimated book value,
near the lowest since March 2009. The value of shares changing
hands on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to
1.17 trillion yen ($15.2 billion), the lowest since Dec. 28.  ‘Dreams’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent
today. The gauge fell 1.9 percent in New York yesterday after
Germany said European Union leaders won’t provide a complete fix
to the euro-area debt crisis. The  S&P 500  rose 6 percent last
week amid optimism over corporate earnings and steps by European
leaders to support the region’s banks.  Germany’s Merkel has made it clear that “dreams that are
taking hold again now that with this package everything will be
solved and everything will be over on Monday won’t be able to be
fulfilled,” spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin.
The search for an end to the crisis “surely extends well into
next year.”  Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 1.8 percent to 335 yen.  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-largest lender by
market value, declined 1.7 percent to 2,152 yen.  Stocks also dropped today after a report showed  China ’s
economy grew 9.1 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, the slowest pace since 2009, as the central bank
tightened monetary policy and export demand weakened.  Consumer-Electronics Makers  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s biggest carmaker, declined 1.9
percent to 2,579 yen. Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s No. 3 automaker
by market value, fell 1.7 percent to 716 yen. Canon fell 1.7
percent to 3,410 yen.  Consumer-electronics makers declined after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut ratings and price targets on concern a strong yen
and falling prices for televisions will hurt earnings in the
sector.  Sony Corp. (6758) , the maker of PlayStation game consoles and
Bravia Televisions, fell 1.2 percent to 1,588 yen after Goldman
lowered its share-price forecast by 25 percent. Panasonic Corp.
declined 2.6 percent to 743 yen after the brokerage cut its
price target by 24 percent.  Olympus Corp. dropped 8.9 percent to 1,417 yen. Ousted
President Michael C. Woodford said he asked U.K. prosecutors to
investigate $687 million the company paid advisers in a 2008
acquisition. Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa said the optical-
equipment maker paid the “appropriate” amount, the Nikkei
reported, citing an interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
