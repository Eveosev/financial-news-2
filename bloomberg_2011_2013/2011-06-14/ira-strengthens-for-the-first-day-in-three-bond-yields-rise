Turkish bonds fell, snapping four
days of gains spurred by Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  re-
election amid investor expectations of monetary tightening to
reduce the record current-account deficit.  Declines in two-year benchmark notes lifted yields four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.88 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg at the 5 p.m. close in
Istanbul. The increase is the biggest in more than a week,
according the TEB Local Benchmark Bond Index. The lira
depreciated for a third day and traded 0.5 percent weaker to
1.5837 per dollar.  “Now both local and offshore players are betting on a
tightening package as elections are behind us,” Turgut Keles,
chief of local market trading at WestLB AG in Istanbul, said by
telephone.  Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s  Justice and
Development Party , or AKP, won 326 seats in the 550-member
parliament, according to preliminary results published by local
media.  His administration must tackle a current-account deficit
that widened to $7.7 billion in April from $4.4 billion a year
earlier, according to data published yesterday by the state
statistics agency in Ankara on its website. It was the second-
biggest gap since records began in 1984, after the revised $9.7
billion record that was posted for March. The median forecast of
seven economists was $7.6 billion.  The central bank has increased bank  reserve requirements 
for short-term deposits by 10 percentage points since December
to help limit lending. It has kept benchmark  interest rates  at
an all-time low of 6.25 percent.  “The chances are slim but the central bank may increase
reserve requirements this month,” said Keles.  The  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  of stocks declined 2.1 percent
to 62,185.54, the lowest level in two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
