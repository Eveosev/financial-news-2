Botswana’s central bank maintained
its  bank rate  at 9.5 percent for the second time to control
inflation pressures, it said today.  Increases in fuel prices in April and May, a rise in
electricity rates from June 1 and a higher forecast for
inflation in neighboring  South Africa  are affecting the outlook
on prices for the southern African nation, the Gaborone-based
Bank of Botswana said in an e-mailed statement.  Inflation slowed in April to 8.2 percent from 8.5 percent a
month earlier, the  Central Statistics Office  said May 13.  Non-mining growth, which is expected to “remain below
potential,” will temper inflation pressures in the “medium
term,” the bank said. It expects to attain its target range of 3
percent to 6 percent by the second half of 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
