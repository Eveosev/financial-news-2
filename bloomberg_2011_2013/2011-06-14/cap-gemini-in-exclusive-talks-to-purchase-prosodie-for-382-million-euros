Cap Gemini SA (CAP) , Europe’s largest
computer-services company, is in exclusive talks to buy Prosodie
SA in a deal that would value the software provider at 382
million euros ($551 million).  Cap Gemini, based in Paris, is negotiating with funds
managed by private-equity firm  Apax Partners  and Prosodie’s
management for the potential deal, the company said in a
statement today. The purchase is predicted to be finalized by
the end of July, Cap Gemini said. Prosodie provides software and
services for e-commerce and telecommunications companies.  Cap Gemini is hunting for acquisitions in new sectors and
technologies as it competes with rivals such as  Atos Origin SA (ATO) ,
which is merging with  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s computer-services unit to
create  Europe ’s biggest information-technology provider.
Countries such as Mexico and Turkey, as well as emerging
technologies such as high-tech water grids, may be acquisition
targets for Cap Gemini, deputy managing director Paul Spence
said last month.  Cap Gemini spent 233 million euros last year for a majority
stake in CPM Braxis, a Brazilian information-technology
provider, making it the market leader in the Latin American
country. Prosodie would be its fourth acquisition this year,
following two smaller deals in France and another in the U.S.  The purchase of Prosodie would add to earnings starting in
the second half as the companies are looking for sales gains and
not planning significant cost savings or job cuts, Chief
Executive Officer Paul Hermelin said today on a conference call.  Cap Gemini  shares rose 2 percent to 38.18 euros as of 1:07
p.m. in Paris, valuing the company at 6 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
