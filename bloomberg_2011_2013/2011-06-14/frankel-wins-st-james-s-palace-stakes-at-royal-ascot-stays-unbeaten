Odds-on favorite Frankel, ridden by
Tom Queally, won the St. James’s Palace Stakes, the main race on
the first day of horseracing’s Royal Ascot meeting.  The unbeaten 30-100 chance, trained by newly knighted Henry
Cecil, won the one-mile event ahead of Zoffany (20-1) in second
and Excelebration (10-1) third. The race carried a top prize of
142,000 pounds ($233,000).  Earlier, Prohibit (7-1), ridden by Jim Crowley, won the
King’s Stand Stakes, a five-furlong sprint.  The five-day Royal Ascot meeting, in Berkshire west of
 London , celebrates its 300th anniversary this year. It’s one of
the top events in U.K. flat racing.  Cecil was knighted in Queen Elizabeth II's birthday honors
list last weekend.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
