London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  won
an employment lawsuit filed by Eli Lederman, the former chief
executive officer of the exchange’s  Turquoise  unit.  The Employment Tribunal in  London  said in a ruling dated
June 2 that Lederman’s claims weren’t “well-founded.’’  LSE had previously conceded that Lederman was unfairly
dismissed after the exchange acquired  Turquoise  in 2010 while
disputing the rest of the claims in the employment case.
Lederman, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley in
London, sued under laws that protect employees when one business
is transferred to another.  The exchange, led by CEO Xavier Rolet, completed its
purchase of Turquoise last year to compete with so-called
multilateral trading facilities and merged the system with LSE’s
Baikal unit. LSE in February 2010 replaced Lederman with  David Lester , the director of information services at the exchange.  “We very much welcome today’s decision,” LSE said in an
e-mailed statement. Lederman declined to comment.  Turquoise was set up by LSE’s biggest customers including
 Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Bank of America Corp.,
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , and had taken
market share from LSE and other traditional exchanges.  To contact the reporters on this story:
