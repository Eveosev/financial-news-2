The inaugural  New York  City  Ironman 
race will cost $895 for a general entry, making it the world’s
most-expensive triathlon.  Officials at World Triathlon Corp., Ironman’s parent
company, disclosed the entry fee today on the event’s  website , a
day before entries will be accepted to the Aug. 11, 2012, race.  A typical Ironman race costs $575.  The higher entry price is due to operating costs related to
staging the first 140.6-mile (226.2-kilometer) competition in
the New York metropolitan area, Ironman officials said. Athletes
will race through parts of  New York City  and suburbs in New York
and  New Jersey .  In addition to paying for permits, organizers must lease
six barges to be placed in the  Hudson River  for the start of the
2.4-mile  swim . A platform also will be constructed across the
river to enable swimmers to exit the water and begin the 112-
mile  bike leg  in Fort Lee, New Jersey.  Registration will be on a first-come, first-served basis.
The field will consist of about 2,500 professional and amateur
athletes, organizers said.  The Hudson River swim will be followed by a bike ride from
the Palisades Parkway on the west side of the Hudson to Fort
Lee, after looping through New Jersey’s Bergen and New York’s
Rockland counties. The race concludes with a  26.2-mile run  from
Fort Lee to Riverside Park in Manhattan.  Competitors have 17 hours to finish.  To contact the reporters on this story:
