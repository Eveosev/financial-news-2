Following is the text of the
monthly retail sales report from the Commerce Department.  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that advance
estimates of U.S. retail and food services sales for May,
adjusted for variation and holiday and trading-day
differences, but not for price changes, were $387.1
billion, a decrease of 0.2 percent (+/-0.5%)* from the
previous month, but 7.7 percent (+/-0.7%) above May 2010.
Total sales for the March through May 2011 period were up
7.5 percent (+/-0.5%) from the same period a year ago. The
March to April 2011 percent change was revised from +0.5
percent (+/-0.5%)* to +0.3 percent (+/-0.3%)*.  Retail trade sales were down 0.3 percent (+/-0.5%)*
from April 2011, but 8.0 percent (+/-0.7%) above last
year. Gasoline stations sales were up 22.3 percent (+/-
1.7%) from May 2010 and nonstore retailers sales were up
15.9 percent (+/-3.1%) from last year.  The advance estimates are based on a subsample of the
Census Bureau's full retail and food services sample. A
stratified random sampling method is used to select
approximately 5,000 retail and food services firms whose
sales are then weighted and benchmarked to represent the
complete universe of over three million retail and food
services firms. Responding firms account for approximately
65% of the MARTS dollar volume estimate. For an
explanation of the measures of sampling variability
included in this report, please see the Reliability of
Estimates section on the last page of this publication.  The Advance Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services for
June is scheduled to be released July 14, 2011 at 8:30 a.m  * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. The
Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical
evidence to conclude that the actual change is different
than zero.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department
