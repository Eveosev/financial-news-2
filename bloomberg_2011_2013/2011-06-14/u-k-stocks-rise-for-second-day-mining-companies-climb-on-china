U.K. stocks climbed for a second
day, led by mining companies, after Chinese industrial
production topped forecasts.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) ,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Rio Tinto 
Group rallied more than 1 percent.  Schroders Plc (SDR)  increased 3.6
percent after HBSC Holdings Plc upgraded the asset manager.  Avis
Europe Plc (AVE)  soared 58 percent after Avis Budget Group Inc. agreed
to buy the London-based car-rental company.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  limited
gains after sales missed analyst estimates.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 26.83, or 0.5 percent, to 5,800.29
at 8:58 a.m. in London, extending yesterday’s rebound from a 2
1/2-month low. The gauge has fallen for three straight weeks as
U.S. economic data added to speculation that the global economic
recovery may be faltering. The FTSE All-Share Index also added
0.5 percent today, and Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 0.6 percent.  China ’s industrial production rose more than estimated in
May, while inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in almost
three years. Production gained 13.3 percent from the year
before, exceeding the median economist forecast of 13.1 percent
in a Bloomberg survey. The 5.5 percent annual gain in consumer
prices matched estimates.  Stocks pared some gains after China raised its banks’
reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points.  Mining companies advanced as copper led base metals higher.
Vedanta Resources climbed 1.2 percent to 2,016 pence, BHP gained
1.4 percent to 2,312 pence and Rio Tinto increased 1.4 percent
to 4,162 pence.  Schroders Upgrade  Schroders rallied 3.6 percent to 1,581 pence after HSBC
raised its recommendation for  Europe ’s largest publicly traded
fund-management company market value to “overweight” from
“neutral.”  Avis Europe soared 58 percent to 310.9 pence after Avis
Budget agreed to pay 636 million pounds ($1.04 billion) for the
second-biggest car-rental company in Europe. Avis Budget will
pay 315 pence per share, that’s 60 percent higher than
yesterday’s closing price of 196.6 pence.  Tesco lost 1.1 percent to 402.7 pence after the U.K.’s
largest grocer said U.K. same-store sales rose 1 percent,
excluding gasoline and including value-added tax, amid
“constrained demand” for general merchandise items. That
missed the median analyst estimate of 1.5 percent growth and
compared to the fourth quarter’s 0.2 percent increase.  Glencore International Plc dropped 2.2 percent to 512.1
pence even as the world’s largest commodity trader reported a 47
percent jump in first-quarter profit to $1.3 billion.  Glencore, which last month sold stock in the world’s
biggest IPO this year, also agreed to buy CST Mining Group
Ltd.’s Peruvian copper project for $475 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
