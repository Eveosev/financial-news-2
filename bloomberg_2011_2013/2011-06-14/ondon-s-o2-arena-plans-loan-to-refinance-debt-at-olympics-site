London ’s O2 arena, controlled by
billionaire  Philip Anschutz , plans to refinance with a new 150
million-pound ($246 million) loan and equity injection from its
owner, according to a person familiar with the situation.  The London 2012 Olympics venue proposed interest at 450
basis points more than the London interbank offered rate for the
seven-year  term loan , said the person, who declined to be
identified because the deal is private. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Los Angeles-based Anschutz Entertainment Group Worldwide
will contribute about 40 million pounds to help repay 184
million pounds of outstanding loans, said the person, who didn’t
want to be identified because the deal is private.  Credit Suisse Group AG is managing the refinancing, the
person said. Lenders are invited to a bank meeting in London on
June 16, the person said.  Michael Roth, a spokesman for Anschutz Entertainment,
wasn’t available to comment outside of business hours in the
U.S.  The O2 arena in London, home to gymnastics and basketball
finals during the 2012 Olympics, has staged events by performers
including Lady Gaga,  Rolling Stones  and Led Zeppelin, according
to its  website.   To contact the reporter on this story:
