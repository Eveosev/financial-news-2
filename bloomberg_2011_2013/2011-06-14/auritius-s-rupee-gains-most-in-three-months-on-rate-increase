Mauritius’s rupee strengthened the
most in almost three months against the dollar after the central
bank raised its benchmark interest rate to curb inflation.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s currency appreciated 2.6
percent to 27.85 per dollar by 2:00 p.m. in the capital,  Port
Louis , the most since March 21. That made it the second-best
performer worldwide against the dollar today after Solomon
Islands’ dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Yesterday’s quarter of a percent rise is almost
equivalent to the yearly yield on the dollar,” Nitish
Benimadhu, a  fund manager  at the Port Louis-based Anglo
Mauritius Financial Services Ltd., said by phone today. “This
attracts hot money.”  The Bank of Mauritius raised its key repo rate to 5.5
percent following a quarterly Monetary Policy Committee meeting,
the second increase in three months. The rupee has gained 10
percent against the dollar since the start of 2011.  “Market sentiment and momentum for the rupee are
stretching,” Benimadhu said. “The rupee is not expected to
weaken in the next six months.”  With the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank’s $600 billion second
round of quantitative easing reaching its end in June, there
will be more volatility in the dollar, Bank of Mauritius
Governor Rundheersing Bheenick told reporters in the capital
today.  “The central bank has no privileged  exchange rate ”, he
said.  Since June 2010, the central bank has bought about $500
million from the domestic foreign-exchange market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
