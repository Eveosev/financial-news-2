Ukrainian ferroalloy maker
 Zaporizhferosplav (ZFER)  may cut as many as 1,900 jobs after increased
power tariffs added to costs,  Ekonomicheskie Izvestia  newspaper
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Pavlo Kravchenko.  Electricity tariffs now make up 54 percent of the cost of
producting ferroalloys, making the plant at Zaporizhzhya in the
country’s southeast uncompetitive, according to the Kiev-based
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
