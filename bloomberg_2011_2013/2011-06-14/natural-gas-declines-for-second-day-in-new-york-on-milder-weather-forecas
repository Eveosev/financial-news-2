Natural gas futures fell to a two-
week low on speculation that below-normal temperatures in the
U.S. Northeast will reduce demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas dropped for a second day as companies including MDA
EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said the weather
will be cooler than normal in the Northeast through June 18. Gas
has gained 12 percent since May 19 as temperatures broke records
in cities including Baltimore.  “We’ve had quite a rally since late May and gas is pulling
back a little bit,” said Carl Neill, an energy consultant at
Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “The weather seems to be not
as hot as it has been.”  Natural gas for July delivery fell 6.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $4.581 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement price since May
27. Gas is down 8.5 percent from a year ago.  The weather will stay “benign” this week in the Midwest
and East,  Matt Rogers , a forecaster with Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, said in a note to clients.  New York will have a normal high temperature of 79 degrees
Fahrenheit (26 Celsius) tomorrow, according to  AccuWeather Inc. 
in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The city had a high of 95
degrees on June 9, 17 degrees above normal.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Milder Weather  “The market lost recent support as temperatures have moved
lower from last week’s record highs to more normal levels,”
James R. Crandell, an analyst with  Barclays Capital  in New York,
said in a note to clients today.  Sales at U.S. retailers fell 0.2 percent in May, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was a drop of
0.5 percent.  Marketed gas production will average 64.61 billion cubic
feet a day in 2011, up from 61.83 billion produced in 2010, the
Energy Department said June 7 in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook.  Gas drilling rigs in the U.S. fell 8 last week to 879,
according to Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc.  “Natural gas production levels continue to keep the market
in check, and in this respect, a steady rig count just below 900
should continue to grow production and loosen the balance
between supply and demand,” Crandell said.  Supply Report  The Energy Department may say June 16 that gas inventories
rose 69 billion cubic feet last week, according to the median of
seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year
average change for the week is an increase of 87 billion.  Stockpiles gained 80 billion cubic feet in the week ended
June 3 to 2.187 trillion cubic feet, the department reported
last week.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
