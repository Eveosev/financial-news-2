Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. (DTG) 
fell the most since 2009 in New York trading after suitor  Avis
Budget Group Inc. (CAR)  agreed to acquire Avis Europe Plc for $1.04
billion, leaving investors to wonder if Avis could buy both
companies.  Dollar Thrifty slid $7.44, or 9.3 percent, to $72.43 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest one-day drop since October 2009. Avis said today that
while it will continue to monitor Dollar Thrifty, its “focus
squarely will be on completing and integrating” the Avis Europe
acquisition.  Avis and  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ)  have been bidding for
Dollar Thrifty since April 2010. The Federal Trade Commission
has been reviewing Avis’s $1.65 billion, or $57.02 a share, bid
since October. The agency is also looking at Hertz’s May offer,
valued at $2.05 billion, or $70.76 a share.  “If you’re a Dollar Thrifty shareholder looking for a
bidding contest, this doesn’t inspire much confidence,” Fred Lowrance, an analyst with Avondale Partners LLC in Nashville,
 Tennessee , said in an interview. “Maybe they could get it done
financially, but you don’t want to take down two massive
acquisitions at one time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
