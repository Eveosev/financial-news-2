Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , East Africa’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, gained for the first day in three
after announcing plans to form a joint venture with Telkom Kenya
Ltd. to manage their towers in a bid to cut costs.  The company’s stock gained as much as 2.6 percent to 4
shillings before trading 1.3 percent higher at 3.95 shillings as
of 11:47 a.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  Safaricom, which is 40 percent owned by Vodafone Plc, and
Telkom Kenya Ltd., a unit of  France Telecom SA (FTE) , are currently in
“advanced negotiations” and expect to reach an agreement
within the next three months, the companies said yesterday.  “We expect that in addition to the initial equity and debt
financing, each partner will contribute some of its existing
infrastructure into a common pool,” Telkom Kenya Chief
Executive Officer Mickael Ghossein said. “We also expect to
consolidate future needs through central planning and deployment
so as to take advantage of the economies of scale presented by
this deal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
