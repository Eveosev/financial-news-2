Three cargoes of North Sea Forties
crude were deferred from the June export program to July, a
revised shipping schedule obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  This reduced the number of shipments for this month to 21
from 24. A total of five cargoes have been dropped from the June
program and five were deferred from May to June.  The revised July program comprised of 21 cargoes, up from
the original 18, according to the schedule.  Output from the Buzzard field, the biggest blend in the
Forties crude stream, was below 19 percent of total Forties
production from May 2 to June 5, compared with the normal level
of about 33 percent, according to BP Plc, which operates the
Forties Pipeline System.  Nexen Inc (NXY) , the operator of Buzzard, is now replacing a
faulty cooling system.  “We expect to increase production beyond current levels
through June and July and reach full capacity of over 200,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day toward the end of July as
upgraded coolers are installed and commissioning of the fourth
platform is completed,” the company said May 19.  Forties is one of four North Sea crude grades used to price
Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than half of global oil. The
other blends are Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  The following table gives details of the three deferred
cargoes:  To contact the reporter on this story:
