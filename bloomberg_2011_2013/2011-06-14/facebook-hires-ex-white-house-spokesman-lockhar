Facebook Inc., grappling with
increased scrutiny from lawmakers, hired former White House
press secretary Joe Lockhart as vice president of global
communications.  Lockhart will join the company on July 15,  Palo Alto ,
California-based Facebook said today in an e-mailed statement.
Lockhart, who most recently worked at strategic communications
company Glover Park Group, served as a spokesman for President
Bill Clinton from 1998 to 2000, during the time of the
president’s impeachment.  “Joe’s arrival brings new skills and greater depth to our
incredibly busy team,” said Elliot Schrage, vice president of
global communications, marketing and public policy, said in the
statement. “His experience building and running a press office
at the White House gives him particular appreciation for the
demands of a global 24-hour news cycle and the challenges of
responding effectively to intense scrutiny.”  Facebook is expanding its communications team amid growing
attention from regulators and privacy advocates. Last year, the
company hired Marne Levine to head up its  Washington  office.
She’s a former top aide to Larry Summers, who was director of
President Barack Obama’s National Economic Council.  Lockhart will move from Washington to California for the
job as soon as family commitments allow, Facebook said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
