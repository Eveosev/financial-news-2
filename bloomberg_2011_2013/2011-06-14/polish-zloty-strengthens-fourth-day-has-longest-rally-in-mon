The Polish zloty headed for its
longest stretch of gains in more than a month before the report
that may show the current account deficit shrank in April.  The zloty appreciated 0.2 percent to 3.9255 per euro as of
9:11 a.m. in Warsaw. The currency strengthened for a fourth day
in the biggest streak of gains since May 11. It advanced the
most among more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  The zloty has rallied as the government sold a $1.2 billion
stake in PZU SA, Poland’s largest insurer, and set the maximum
price in the planned offering of a coking-coal producer
Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA, boosting demand for currency. The
central bank will probably say the current account gap narrowed
to 1 billion euros ($1.45 billion) from 1.38 billion euros a
month earlier, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 23 economists.  The “current account release should reinforce the zloty
strengthening trend,”  Mateusz Szczurek , chief economist at ING
Bank Slaski SA in Warsaw, wrote in a note to customers. ING
predicts a deficit of 315 million euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
