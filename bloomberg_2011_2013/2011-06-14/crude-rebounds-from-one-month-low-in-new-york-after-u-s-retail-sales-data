Oil rebounded from its lowest in a
month in  New York  after U.S. retail sales data indicated
American consumers are overcoming elevated gasoline costs.  Sales at retailers fell 0.2 percent in May, less than
economists estimated, figures from the Commerce Department in
 Washington  showed today. Crude fell earlier as  China , the
worldâ€™s largest energy user, ordered lenders to set aside more
cash as reserves after inflation accelerated to the fastest pace
in almost three years.  Crude for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
was up 31 cents at $97.62 a barrel at 1:49 p.m. London time,
after falling as low as $96.51. The contract yesterday declined
$1.99, or 2 percent, to $97.30, the lowest settlement since May
17. Futures have gained 30 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for July delivery was up 90 cents at $120 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
front-month European benchmark contract was at a premium of
$22.38 to U.S. futures after reaching a record $22.72 earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
