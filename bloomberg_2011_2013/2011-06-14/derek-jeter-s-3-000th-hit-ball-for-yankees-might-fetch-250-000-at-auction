Derek Jeter ’s 3,000th hit may be
worth as much as $250,000 to the person who ends up with the
ball.  Jeter, 36, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list
yesterday with a strained right calf, is six hits away from
becoming the 28th player in Major League Baseball history to
reach the milestone.  If the ball finds its way to auction, a conservative
estimate for its sale price would approach $100,000 and it may
go for several times that -- because of Jeter’s popularity and
his status as the first player to reach the mark in a New York
Yankees uniform, several auction house heads said.  “I wouldn’t be surprised if it could go for as much as a
quarter-million dollars,” Doug Allen, president of Chicago-
based  Legendary Auctions , said in a telephone interview. “Any
3,000-hit ball could approach six figures, but because you have
Jeter, who is a popular player, and he’s a Yankee, that could
absolutely double the number. Yankee stuff always sells for more
than anything else.”  A conservative estimate for Jeter’s 3,000-hit ball would be
about $75,000 to $100,000, according to Troy Kinunen, president
of  Mears Auctions  in South Milwaukee,  Wisconsin .  “I know nine guys who would bid at that range,” Kinunen
said. “What you don’t know is the New York stockbroker who’s
not in the hobby, per se, but that catches his fancy and he bids
whatever he wants to bid on it. A guy outside the hobby might go
crazy over that piece.”  Milestone Investments  Milestone balls such as a 3,000th hit or 500th home run can
be financially safer investments than some that break records,
said David Hunt, president of Exton, Pennsylvania-based  Hunt
Auctions .  “If you’re buying a record-breaking piece such as the Mark McGwire home-run-record ball, that’s certainly historic, but
somebody can break the record two years later,” Hunt said.  When comparing 3,000 hits to 500 or 600 home runs, there
has been a shift in what’s now seen as more impressive, or at
least most pure, said Allen.  Twenty-five players have hit  500 home runs , the most recent
being Gary Sheffield on April 17, 2009. The only major leaguers
to hit at least 600 home runs are  Barry Bonds  (762),  Hank Aaron 
(755),  Babe Ruth  (714),  Willie Mays  (660), Ken Griffey Jr. (630),
 Sammy Sosa  (609) and  Alex Rodriguez , who has 626 home runs and
is still playing.  ‘Steroid Problems’  “With the development of all the steroid problems in
baseball, it’s like the 500th home run and 600th home run have
been diluted, and the 3,000th hit is raised in popularity to be
the big milestone,” Allen said.  Brandon Steiner, chief executive officer of Steiner Sports
Marketing Inc. in New Rochelle, New York, valued Jeter’s
milestone ball at between $100,000 and $150,000.  Steiner Sports , Jeter’s exclusive memorabilia seller, is
planning to sell autographed collectible bats and photography
from the game, as well as game-used items. The company also
commissioned  artist Stephen Holland  to paint a picture of Jeter
at the game, of which limited editions will be sold.  “We’re still dreaming up stuff,” Steiner said in a
telephone interview as Jeter’s move to the disabled list delayed
the achievement. “It’s a little bit of a help for us. We have a
little bit more time to play around.”  The  National Baseball Hall of Fame  also will be ready,
having spoken with Jeter and the Yankees about accepting an
artifact to commemorate the milestone, Hall spokesman Brad Horn
said in a telephone interview.  The museum in Cooperstown, New York, already has 11 Jeter
items, including a World Series jersey from his rookie season in
1996 and the batting gloves he wore for hit No. 2,722 in
September 2009, breaking  Lou Gehrig ’s team record. Which item is
donated won’t be decided until after the event, Horn said.  The Hall of Fame has 3,000-hit balls from Aaron, Mays, Stan
Musial, Carl Yastrzemski, Paul Waner and Al Kaline.  Special Markings  When he steps to the plate with 2,999 hits, balls pitched
to Jeter will be numbered with special markings for
authentication purposes, according to John Blundell, a Major
League Baseball spokesman. The markings can’t be seen by the
naked eye.  The only person to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit was
Wade Boggs, on Aug. 7, 1999, at Tropicana Field while playing
for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Other ways the ball could find its
way into the stands and into the hands of someone who might put
it up for auction include a ground-rule double, where the ball
bounces into the stands, and a throwing error that comes after a
hit.  “It points more to the higher values than the low, because
the likelihood of one of those baseballs getting out there for
the collecting public to purchase is very low,” Hunt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
