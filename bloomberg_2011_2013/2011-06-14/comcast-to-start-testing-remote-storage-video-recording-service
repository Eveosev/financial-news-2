Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S.
cable-TV provider, plans to start testing a video-recording
service that lets customers store programs remotely on the
company’s server computers, rather than on their set-top boxes.  Comcast will test the so-called cloud-based recording
service in some markets late this year or early next year, Chief
Technology Officer Tony Werner said in an interview at an
industry event in  Chicago  today.  The Philadelphia-based company is adding new services after
losing basic cable-TV customers for at least four years amid
competition from phone companies, satellite-TV providers and
Internet-video sites. A remote-storage service requires cable
carriers to boost investment in their data centers, while
allowing them to curb spending on set-top boxes.  “We like the idea of a cloud DVR because you can virtually
service your customers,” Werner said. “We’ll start to roll it
out, see what the response is and go from there.”  Werner said it was too early to know the initial markets or
pricing for the new service.  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , the New
York area cable operator, said in February it had started
providing a remote-storage recording service in the city and
that it had stopped buying physical digital video recorders.  Comcast rose 22 cents to $23.93 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained 8.9 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
