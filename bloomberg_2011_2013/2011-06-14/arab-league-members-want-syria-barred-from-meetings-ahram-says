Some Arab League members have
proposed suspending  Syria ’s participation in the organization’s
meetings to protest violence against demonstrators in Syria,
 Egypt ’s  Al Ahram  newspaper reported.  Other members “fiercely” oppose the proposal, arguing
that the move “could complicate reaching a peaceful solution”
in Syria, the state-run, Cairo-based paper said, citing informed
people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
