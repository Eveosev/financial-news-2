Ethanol futures fell the most in
more than a week on speculation that warm weather in the U.S.
Midwest will improve corn planting and lower manufacturing costs
for the fuel.  The gasoline additive slumped 0.9 percent a day after the
Agriculture Department said about 69 percent of the U.S. corn
crop was in good or excellent condition on June 12, up from 67
percent a week earlier. One bushel of corn distills into at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  “We saw ethanol fall off, but not as much as you would’ve
thought with corn down,” said Jim Damask, a manager at
BiofuelsConnect, a Heathrow, Florida-based alternative energy
broker. “Apparently they think we have plenty of corn. Crude
and gasoline were up, so that helped ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery slipped 2.6 cents to
$2.751 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Futures have
gained 16 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 8
cents, or 2.8 percent, to $2.775 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive declined 4 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.84, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast slid 3.5 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $2.875 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel lost 3 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.755.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 19.5 cents, or
2.8 percent, to $6.85 a bushel in Chicago. Corn is the primary
input for ethanol production in the U.S.  Crude for July delivery gained $2.07, or 2.1 percent, to
settle at $99.37 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in
the biggest one-day increase since May 18. Futures have climbed
32 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for July delivery gained 6.78 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $3.0646 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
settlement price since May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
