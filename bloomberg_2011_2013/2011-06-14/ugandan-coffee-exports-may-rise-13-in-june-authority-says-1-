Coffee exports from  Uganda ,  Africa ’s
second-largest producer of the crop, may this month climb 13
percent from last year to 265,000 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags,
according to the Uganda Coffee Development Authority.  The forecast is 4.6 percent higher than the 253,270 bags
exported last month, the authority official, who declined to be
named because he isn’t authorized to speak to the press, wrote
in an e-mail today.  A secondary harvesting in the central and eastern regions,
as well as the main crop in the western and southwestern regions
has picked up momentum earlier than usual, according to the
agency.  Shipments in the 12 months through September may decline to
2.6 million 60-kilogram bags, from a Sept. 20 forecast of 3.1
million bags, the authority said on April 13.  The revised forecast is 2.6 percent lower than 2.67 million
bags exported last season, according to the authority. Exports
from the start of the season on Oct. 1 through May declined to
1.75 million bags, from 1.78 million bags a year earlier,
according to a tally of the agency figures by Bloomberg News.  Draught  East Africa’s third-largest economy had a draught from
December to April, which the government blamed on  climate
change . More than 95 percent of Uganda’s crop is grown by small-
scale farmers whose crop is predominantly rain-fed, according to
the authority.  Uganda earned $243.6 million from the sales of the beans
last season, down from $291.3 million a year earlier. Robusta
beans, used in instant coffee, account for about 85 percent of
the country’s annual coffee output.  The country consumes less than 3 percent of its annual
output, according to the Eastern African Fine Coffee
Association.  The East African nation plans to increase production to 4.5
million bags a season by 2015 through an ongoing replanting
program, according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
