U.S. stocks rallied and the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index headed for its biggest gain in two months
after better-than-estimated data on American retail sales and
Chinese industrial production.  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  advanced the most in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , gaining 3.8 percent. Best Buy Co., the
world’s largest consumer electronics retailer, surged 4.7
percent after profit exceeded analysts’ forecasts on rising
demand for smartphones. J.C. Penney Co. soared 16 after naming
 Ron Johnson ,  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s retail head, as its chief executive
officer. Energy shares rallied the most among 10 groups in the
S&P 500 as oil rebounded from its lowest in a month.  The S&P 500 rose 1.4 percent to 1,289.24 at 12:56 p.m. in
New York. The Dow increased 136 points, or 1.1 percent, to
12,088.97. The S&P 500 headed for its biggest gain on a closing
basis since March 21, with the Dow poised for its best since
April 20.  “The China numbers were fine and the retail sales report
was pretty much in line,” said Liam Dalton, president of Axiom
Capital Management Inc. in  New York , which oversees $1.4
billion. “We got ourselves into a short-term oversold condition
and the market wants to bounce back now. That’s indicative of
the trading range we will be in for a while. There’s a change in
tone in the data as it has been coming in slower, but on the
other hand valuations are relatively low.”  Stock futures extended their gains after a Commerce
Department report showed sales at retailers fell 0.2 percent in
May, less than forecast and indicating that American consumers
are overcoming elevated gasoline costs. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was a drop of 0.5 percent.  China’s Output  China reported that  industrial production  climbed more than
estimated in May, while the country’s inflation last month
accelerated to the fastest pace in almost three years.
Production gained 13.3 percent from the year before, exceeding
the median economist forecast of 13.1 percent in a Bloomberg
survey. The 5.5 percent annual gain in consumer prices matched
estimates.  U.S. stocks rose yesterday, rebounding from six weeks of
losses, as a pickup in takeovers and the cheapest valuations in
almost a year helped offset concern that the economic recovery
is faltering.  More than $1 trillion was erased from U.S. equity markets
from the S&P 500’s peak on April 29 through yesterday, leaving
the measure trading at about 12.8 times its companies’ estimated
earnings for 2011. That’s the cheapest valuation since August.
The index is still up 2.6 percent for 2011.  The  S&P 500  fell 6.8 percent from the end of April through
June 10 as sales of existing homes unexpectedly declined, the
 unemployment rate  rose and concern escalated that one or more
European countries will fail to repay all their debt.  Birinyi’s Bullish  Birinyi Associates Inc.’s Jeffrey Yale Rubin said the firm
is bullish on equities this year, while Dean Curnutt of Macro
Risk Advisors said the performance of stocks depends on the
actions by the  Federal Reserve .  “For the remainder of the year, we’re positive,” Rubin
said today at a panel discussion on equities at the Bloomberg
Money Managers conference in  Boston . For the S&P 500, “we have
a target of 2,100 but that’s not this year, that’s not next
year. When we look at stock markets that go on for a long period
of time, that start off quickly -- 1974, 1982, 2009 -- those
markets are not ones that end quickly. If you also look at those
markets during this period, phase two of the market, it runs
into difficulty.”  S&P 500 at 2,100  Curnutt, the New York-based chief executive officer of
Macro Risk, said the firm’s view on stocks is “largely
conditional” on the next policy response by the U.S. central
bank. The Fed’s $600 billion program of buying Treasuries to
stimulate the economy is ending this month. The S&P 500 could
rise to 2,100 if the Fed decided it wanted it to, he said at the
conference.  Wholesale costs in the U.S. rose more than forecast in May,
led by higher prices for fuel and the fastest rise in 30 years
for apparel and textiles. The 0.2 percent increase in the
producer-price index compares with the 0.1 percent median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington .  Home Depot added 3.8 percent to $34.53. Best Buy gained 4.7
percent to $30.17 after net income fell 12 percent to $136
million, or 35 cents a share, in the quarter ended May 28.
Analysts predicted 33 cents, the average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  J.C. Penney Soars  J.C. Penney rallied 16 percent to $34.95. The department-
store owner named Johnson, 52, as CEO to help revive sales. He
will take his role on Nov. 1 and report to current CEO Myron Ullman, who will become executive chairman. Johnson, a former
Target Corp. executive, was hired by Apple Chief  Steve Jobs  to
help build the company’s retail operation in 2000.  Apple climbed 1.4 percent to $331.21 as the maker of the
iPhone and iPad agreed to pay an undisclosed sum and royalties
to Nokia Oyj, settling all patent litigation between the two
companies. The Finnish mobile-phone maker filed a lawsuit in
October 2009, accusing Apple of infringing its patents. Apple
will pay Nokia royalties for the term of the agreement.  Energy shares gained 2 percent, the most among 10 S&P 500
industry groups as oil rose for the first time in three days in
New York. Crude for July delivery gained $1.47, or 1.5 percent,
to $98.77 a barrel.  McGraw-Hill Cos. gained 2.2 percent to $41.64. The
publisher and provider of financial data said it retained Morgan
Stanley to pursue the divestiture of its broadcasting group.  Car Rental  Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. (DTG) , the third-biggest
U.S. car-rental company, slumped 8.7 percent to $72.94.  Avis
Budget Group Inc. (CAR) , which has been bidding against  Hertz Global
Holdings Inc. (HTZ)  for Dollar Thrifty, agreed to buy  Avis Europe Plc (AVE) ,
the second-biggest car-rental company on the continent. The
announcement left investors wondering if Avis could buy both
companies. Avis rose 3.6 percent to $16.53, while Hertz rose 9.5
percent to $15.46.  Kellogg Co. (K)  fell 1.7 percent to $54.45. The largest U.S.
breakfast cereal maker was warned by U.S. regulators after
listeria was found in an inspection of a plant that had flies
and pools of water.  To contact the reporter on this story:
