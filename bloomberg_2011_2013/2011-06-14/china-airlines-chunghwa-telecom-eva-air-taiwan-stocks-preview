Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei
trading.  The Taiex Index rose 116.26, or 1.3 percent, to 8,829.21.  Evergreen Construction Corp. (5506)  (5506 TT) gained 2.2 percent
to NT$7.86, the biggest advance since May 19. The construction
company plans to sell $10 million of five-year secured
convertible bonds overseas in a private placement to help
purchase raw materials abroad, the company said in a statement
to the Taiwan stock exchange yesterday.  HTC Corp. (2498)  (2498 TT) jumped 6 percent to NT$1,150, the
biggest advance since March 16. There is speculation the company
may make a positive announcement or a share buyback at an annual
shareholder meeting tomorrow, according to a UBS AG sales note
sent to fund managers. Maggie Cheng, a public relations officer
for HTC, didn’t answer calls to her office.  Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corp. (3189)  (3189 TT) surged by
the 6.9 percent daily limit to NT$123.50, the biggest advance
since March 30, after the shares fell “too much in the past two
sessions,” said Bonny Weng, an analyst at KGI Securities Co.
The stock had slumped 10.5 percent during the previous two
trading days, the steepest back-to-back loss since the period
ended March 16.  Mosel Vitelic Inc. (2342)  (2342 TT), a solar-cell maker, gained
1.5 percent to NT$9.54. The company plans to sell 132.5 million
new shares to replenish working capital, fund plant expansion
and purchase machinery and equipment, the company said in a
statement to the Taiwan stock exchange yesterday.  Yageo Corp. (2327)  (2327 TT) slid 6.4 percent to NT$14.75, the
biggest drop since May 25, 2010, after the Commercial Times
cited an unidentified person at the Financial Supervisory
Commission as saying the Taiwan regulator may reject an
application by Orion Investment Co. to acquire Yageo on concerns
the rights of minority shareholders aren’t fully protected.
Jacky Chen, an investor relations spokesman, said the company
hasn’t received any document from regulators and can’t comment
on the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
