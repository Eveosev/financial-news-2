Asian stocks swung between gains and
losses as Standard & Poor’s cut  Greece ’s credit rating to the
lowest debt grade, feeding doubts over a global economic
recovery. Japanese power companies advanced.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company,
dropped 1.3 percent in Sydney as oil and metal prices dropped.
Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company by
sales, fell 1.1 percent. Tokyo Electric Power Co. jumped 11
percent in Tokyo, leading Japanese power companies higher. The
utility may raise electricity rates by 16 percent in the next
fiscal year under a plan designed to deal with the aftermath of
the worst nuclear accident in 25 years, the Mainichi newspaper
reported.  “Concerns about the economic slowdown are emerging and
investors are increasingly avoiding risk assets,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.
“Investors are unwinding their positions in the commodity
market.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.1 percent to 131.67
as of 9:34 a.m. in  Tokyo  after falling 0.1 percent. About three
stocks gained for every two that fell on the 1017-member gauge.  To contact the reporters on this story:
