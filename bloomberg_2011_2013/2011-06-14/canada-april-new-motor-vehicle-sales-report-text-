The following is the text
of  Canada 's new motor vehicles sales report for April
released by  Statistics Canada .  The number of new motor vehicles sold declined 1.1% in
April to 134,529 units. Higher sales in Quebec, Ontario
and British Columbia (including the territories) were more
than offset by declines in the other provinces.  Preliminary industry data indicate that the number of
new motor vehicles sold in May decreased 6%.  Truck sales drive decline  Sales of trucks (which include minivans, sport-utility
vehicles, light and heavy trucks, vans and buses)
decreased 3.0% in April, erasing gains reported in the
previous month.  Passenger car sales increased 1.4%, a third consecutive
monthly gain. Overseas-built passenger cars accounted for
the advance, rising 5.4%. After three months of gains,
sales of North American-built passenger cars fell 0.8%.
Sales of North American built passenger cars have been on
the rise since the middle of 2010.  Alberta  leads declines  In April, higher sales in Quebec (+0.6%), Ontario
(+0.4%) and the region formed by British Columbia and the
territories (+0.9%) were more than offset by declines in
the other provinces.  The largest decline in units sold was in Alberta 
(-2.5%), following three straight months of increases.  The remaining provinces posted decreases that ranged
from 5.9% in  New Brunswick  to 9.2% in Manitoba.  To contact the reporter on this story:
