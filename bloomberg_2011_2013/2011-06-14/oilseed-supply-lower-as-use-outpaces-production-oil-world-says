Oilseed stockpiles will decline in
the 2011-2012 marketing year as consumption for food, fuel and
feed will outpace production, Oil World said.  Global stockpiles of 10 oilseeds including soybeans and
rapeseed will fall 4 percent to 78.9 million metric tons as
consumption gains 19 percent to 463.2 million tons, Oil World
said today in a report. Soybean inventories will fall 4.2
percent to 66.9 million tons, the analyst said. Production will
rise to 459.2 million tons, 11 percent more than the prior year,
according to the report.  “World demand was strong during most of the past 12
months,” Oil World said. “The driving forces are to be seen in
the expanding food demand in  India ,  China  and other emerging
countries as well as in increasing requirements of biofuels in
line with higher mandates applied primarily in  South America ,
North America and  Europe .”  Oilseed production has been cut as dry conditions in parts
of France, Germany and the U.K. hurt yields and above-normal
losses due to cold weather in the U.S. and Canada cut output in
North America, according to the report. Soybean prices have
gained 50 percent in the past year, partly as demand for oils
and meal made from the oilseed improved, Oil World said.  “Oilmeal demand showed considerable growth during the past
12 months fueled by rising livestock and aquaculture
production,” Oil World said. “Production losses in some
regions and high grain prices also contributed to increased
usage of oilmeals in 2010-11.”  Increasing Dependency  The world is becoming increasingly dependent on South
American soybean production, according to the report. Output in
 Argentina  will rise 7.7 percent to 53 million tons and the
Brazilian harvest will gain 500,000 tons to 73.5 million tons,
Oil World said. Farmers in  Paraguay , Bolivia and Uruguay will
collect 12.6 million tons, up 4.7 percent, the analyst said.  “We see considerable potential for expansion in plantings
and production in 2011-12 as well as subsequent years” in South
America, Oil World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
