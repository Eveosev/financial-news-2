The director of authorizations at
the U.K. Financial Services Authority resigned last week,
becoming at least the fifth top official to leave since the
government said it would abolish the regulator.  Graeme Ashley-Fenn resigned so he could be with his family
during an illness, FSA spokeswoman Clare Duffy said today.
Sharon Campbell, who works under him, will take over on an
interim basis the unit that grants permission to conduct
business.  The regulator restructured into two divisions to prepare
for a government-mandated handover of lender supervision to the
 Bank of England . The agency has split internally into a
prudential regulatory authority and a consumer protection agency
to ready itself for a formal transition next year.  Sally Dewar, the managing director of risk, resigned last
year and later joined JPMorgan Chase & Co. as a managing
director. Two former FSA department heads, David Strachan and
Jon Pain, left the regulator to take jobs at separate accounting
firms.  Dan Waters , the FSAâ€™s former director of conduct risk,
stepped down in November.  To contact the reporter for this story:
