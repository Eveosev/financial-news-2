Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev ’s
decision to replace three deputy interior ministers last week
shows the “substantive nature” of his effort to revamp the
country’s police and fight abuses of power, VTB Capital said.  The changes, initiated in February 2010, are “likely to be
seen as the most-telling litmus test of the president’s
commitment to anti-corruption rhetoric,” Alexey Zabotkin and
Aleksandra Evtifyeva, analysts at VTB Capital in Moscow, wrote
in a research note e-mailed today. Progress so far has “been
more than satisfactory.”  Medvedev has already replaced about 100 of 450 senior
officers undergoing a recertification process and selected six
of Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev’s deputies, according to
VTB Capital, the investment-banking unit of  Russia ’s second-
biggest lender. The latest changes were announced June 11 on the
Kremlin  website .  The police overhaul was aimed at reducing corruption and
improving the force’s public image after a series of scandals,
including the April 2009 shooting rampage of a police major in a
Moscow supermarket.  A new law governing police, including a more stringent code
of conduct, took effect on March 1. Under the changes, police
officers will receive larger salaries after undergoing
recertification.  To contact the reporter on this story:
