Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators rose for a second day on above-
normal temperatures in  Texas  that may spark air-conditioning
demand. Shipments to Texas gained for a fourth day.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to power plants in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments climbed 9,674 megawatts to 16.9
million dekatherms (16.4 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in Texas
advanced 14 percent to 1.79 million dekatherms.  Temperatures in Dallas today may reach 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), 9 above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. Highs are
forecast to be in the upper 90s to 100 or higher for the rest of
this week, AccuWeather said.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 2.2 percent to
22.7 million dekatherms, declining for a sixth day.  Wholesale gas at the Katy hub in Texas rose 4.23 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $4.7162 per million British thermal units
yesterday on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
gained 3.06 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $4.7507 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
