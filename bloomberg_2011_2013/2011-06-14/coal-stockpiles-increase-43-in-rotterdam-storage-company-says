The Port of Rotterdam’s largest
coal-storage company said stockpiles of the fuel rose 43 percent
in about the last 2 1/2 months as low water levels in the Rhine
River impede barge transport of the commodity.  Inventories at facilities operated by Europees Massagoed-
Overslagbedrijf BV, or EMO, are at 3 million metric tons,
Commercial Manager Sjaak Roukema said by e-mail today. That’s up
from 2.1 million tons at the beginning of April.  The barge clearance level at Cologne fell to 197
centimeters (78 inches) on June 10 from 205 centimeters the day
before, according to German government data available on
Bloomberg. It’s dropped 45 percent in the past year.  Rotterdam  is  Europe ’s busiest port, handling coal imports
for utilities in  Germany  including EON AG. Emo is based in
Maasvlakte,  Netherlands .  To contact the reporter on this story:
