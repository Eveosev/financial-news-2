The following is the text of
the
retail sales and inventories by business report for April
from the Commerce Department.  Notice of Revision  Revisions to the adjusted and not adjusted monthly
estimates for Manufacturing Shipments and Inventories were
released May 13, 2011 and are reflected in this release.
For further information on these revisions, see
 http://www.census.gov/m3 .  Sales  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that the
combined value of distributive trade sales and
manufacturers' shipments for April, adjusted for seasonal
and trading-day difference but not for price changes, was
estimated at $1,185.6 billion, up 0.1 percent (+/-0.2%)*
from March 2011 and up 11.0 percent (+/-0.5%) from April
2010.  Inventories  Manufacturers' and trade inventories, adjusted for
seasonal variations but not for price changes, were
estimated at an end-of-month level of $1,497.5 billion, up
0.8 percent (+/-0.1%) from March 2011 and up 10.6 percent
(+/-0.4%) from April 2010.  Inventories/Sales Ratio  The total business inventories/sales ratio based on
seasonally adjusted data at the end of April was 1.26. The
April 2010 ratio was 1.27.  * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. The
Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical
evidence to conclude that the actual change is different
from zero.  To contact the reporter on this story:
