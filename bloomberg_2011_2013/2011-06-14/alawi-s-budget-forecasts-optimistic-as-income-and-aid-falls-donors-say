Malawi’s revenue forecasts may be
too optimistic because of declining income from tobacco, rising
fuel costs, foreign exchange shortages and a drop in aid, a
group of foreign donors said.  The group, known as the Common Approach to Budget Support,
recommended Malawi put in place contingency measures in case
revenue falls short of the expected 307 billion kwacha for the
fiscal year through June 2012, it said in an e-mailed statement
today. Finance Minister Ken Kandodo on June 3 forecast revenue
will meet recurrent spending even though aid is to decline after
the U.K. reviewed relations with the country.  Some countries are holding back on giving aid to the
southern African country until it completes the second review of
its program with the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
