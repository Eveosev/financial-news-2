European Union Trade Commissioner
Karel  De Gucht  said an upcoming World Trade Organization ruling
on whether  China  broke global rules by limiting raw-material
exports will bolster EU plans to challenge other Chinese
restrictions, Reuters reported.  “I believe this will considerably strengthen the position
of the European Union,” De Gucht told a conference in Brussels
today, according to Reuters.  WTO judges are investigating complaints by the EU, the U.S.
and  Mexico  against Chinese restrictions on exports of raw
materials. The WTO’s report will be made public next month,
Reuters cited De Gucht as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
