The Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic
region, including  Washington , will probably be much warmer than
normal next week, according to  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  His 6- to 10-day outlook calls for warmer weather to engulf
the eastern U.S., with temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit
(32 Celsius) stretching from  Missouri  to  Delaware .  “After this week’s benign weather, another surge of
stronger heat is on the agenda starting this weekend and going
into next week,” Rogers said today in a note to clients.  Rogers said the heat will moderate, remaining slightly
warmer than normal, from June 24 to June 28. There’s a chance
that the cooling may be more intense, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
