Arnab Mitra, a Mumbai-based analyst
with India Infoline Ltd., comments on stocks of consumer goods
makers. Mitra spoke in a telephone interview.  Britannia Industries Ltd. (BRIT)  climbed 5.3 percent to 470.7
rupees, the highest since September 2010.  Emami Ltd. (HMN) , a maker of
skin care products, rose 3.2 percent to 447 rupees, the most in
four weeks. The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or
Sensex, added 0.2 percent to 18,308.66, the most in a week, at
the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai.  “All stocks, be it Unilever, ITC, Godrej or Emami, in the
last one month have been showing strength.  ‘‘The only visibility of growth and earnings is in the
consumer sector. The other sectors are seeing very low growth
visibility so you’d see people shifting into consumer stocks.  ‘‘The sector should continue to be strong. Next quarter
results could be a point when people would again relook at
volume growth and such things. If it sustains, and I think it
will, I don’t think there’s any major risk to the sector coming
down from this level.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
