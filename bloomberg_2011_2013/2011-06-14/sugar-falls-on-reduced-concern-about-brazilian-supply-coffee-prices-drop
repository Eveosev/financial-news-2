Sugar fell the most in four days in
 London  after an industry group said production picked up in the
second half of May in the main Brazilian producing region.
Coffee declined in London.  Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South rose 6.8 percent in
the second half of May as farmers accelerated the harvest on dry
weather, industry association Unica said yesterday. The region’s
sugar production had plunged almost 47 percent from the
beginning of the harvest in mid-March to May 16, according to
the group. Brazil is the world’s biggest producer.  “The report does indicate progress is being made in the
Center South, and that’s driving prices lower today,” said
Keith Flury, a London-based analyst at Rabobank International.
“Yet, the market still has a number of concerns about output
and yield, which may further support the rally.”  White, or refined, sugar for August delivery fell $3.50, or
0.5 percent, to $720 a metric ton by 9:34 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
London. It earlier fell as much as 0.6 percent, the most since
June 9. Raw sugar for October delivery was unchanged at 24.38
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Dry weather in the last two weeks of May accelerated the
harvesting, while it also damaged further development of the
crop due to be gathered in the coming months, Unica said.
Productivity is also lower because older plantations are being
harvested, it said. Unica said it plans to revise its forecast
for the 2011-2012 crop after completing a survey of cane
available for crushing early next month.  Output increased to 2.38 million tons between May 16 and
May 31, from 2.23 million a year earlier, Unica said. Mills in
the region turned 46 percent of the cane into sugar, up from
44.7 percent a year ago, with the remainder processed into
ethanol, it said.  Rain Delays  Brazil ’s sugar-cane harvest usually runs from April to
December, with peak output between July and September. It was
delayed this year because of rains. Unica in March estimated
Center South’s harvest at 568.5 million tons and said May 26
lower yields might result in a smaller crop than initially
forecast.  Robusta coffee for September delivery fell $5, or 0.2
percent, to $2,466 a ton in London. Arabica coffee for September
delivery gained 0.4 percent to $2.717 a pound in New York.  Cocoa for July delivery fell 1 pound to 1,837 pounds
($3,011) a ton in London. Cocoa for September delivery was down
0.2 percent at $2,963 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
