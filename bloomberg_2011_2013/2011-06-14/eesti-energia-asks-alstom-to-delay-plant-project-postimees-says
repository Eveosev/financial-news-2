Eesti Energia AS, the biggest Baltic
utility, is holding talks with  Alstom SA (ALO)  to postpone
construction of two oil-shale fired  power plants ,  Postimees 
reported, citing company executives and board members.  Eesti Energia wants to delay the construction until early
next year to receive guarantees related to the financing after
the Baltic country earlier this month retracted an application
to the European Commission to approve state aid of as much as
1.5 billion euros ($2.2 billion) for the plants, the newspaper
reported, citing Chief Financial Officer Margus Kaasik.  Estonia is seeking permission from the European Union
executive to award free carbon allowances for the construction
instead of state aid, Einari Kisel, vice chancellor at the
Economy Ministry, said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
