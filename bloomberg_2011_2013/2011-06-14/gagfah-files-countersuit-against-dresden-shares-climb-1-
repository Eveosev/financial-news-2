Gagfah SA (GFJ) ,  Germany ’s largest
publicly traded property company, sued the City of Dresden over
its claim that Gagfah broke a sales agreement. The shares gained
the most in more than two months.  Gagfah’s counter claim followed Dresden’s decision to sue
the company for 1.08 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in April. That
lawsuit, over claims that Gagfah broke an agreement for
apartments at its WOBA Dresden unit, was based on “strongly
motivated economic interest” and distorted the company’s share
price, Gagfah said in a statement today.  Gagfah owns about 160,000 apartments across Germany,
including about 38,000 in Dresden and 24,000 in Berlin. Fortress
Investment Group LLC acquired the WOBA unit in 2006 for 1.75
billion euros and transferred it to Gagfah, its holding company
at the time that later went public.  “The city is not demanding damages, but rather penalties,
which in the case of one sale amounts to 254 times the actual
value of the property sold,” Chief Executive Officer William Brennan said in the statement. “That alone speaks to how absurd
and excessive the complaint is.”  Gagfah rose 3.8 percent in Frankfurt trading, the highest
since March 28, valuing the company at 1.2 billion euros. The
stock closed at 8.94 euros on Feb. 17, the highest this year,
before the threat of legal action surfaced.  The case is LG Dresden, 9 0 786/11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
