Derek Jeter  of the  New York Yankees 
may not reach the 3,000-hit milestone at home after suffering an
injury to his right calf during last night’s 1-0 loss to the
 Cleveland Indians .  Jeter had a single in three at-bats -- giving him 2,994
hits for his career -- before leaving the game after the fifth
inning. He was taken for medical tests, the results of which
weren’t immediately available.  “I’m not sure what we’re going to discover here, but
obviously he looked pretty sore,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi 
said during a news conference. “We’ll just keep our fingers
crossed and hopefully it’s not too serious.”  The Yankees start a three-game series today against the
 Texas Rangers  at Yankee Stadium before leaving for a six-game
road trip to  Chicago  and Cincinnati.  “It’s frustrating,” said Girardi, adding that Jeter will
likely miss at least today’s game. “To be six hits away, you
would have hoped he could have done it on this homestand.”  Jeter, 36, is seeking to become the 28th player in Major
League Baseball history to collect 3,000 hits. He’d be the first
to do so in a Yankee uniform.  Jeter was replaced by Eduardo Nunez after a fly out in the
bottom of the fifth inning. Jeter may have been injured as he
ran out of the batter’s box, Girardi said.  “We’re worried about it,” Girardi said. “He just walked
off the field and you could tell he was done. He said it wasn’t
real tight when they examined him. I couldn’t tell you what it
is. We’ll just have to wait and see.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
