Oil traded near the lowest in almost
a month as signs of slowing growth in the U.S. and  China ’s moves
to tackle inflation spurred concern fuel demand may falter.  China, the world’s largest energy user, ordered lenders to
set aside more cash as reserves after inflation accelerated to
the fastest pace in almost three years. Consumer prices in the
country climbed 5.5 percent, the quickest pace since 2008. In
the U.S., a report today may show retail sales fell in May for
the first time in 11 months.  The industry-funded  American
Petroleum Institute  will report stockpile data today.  “Fundamentals in the U.S. are still gloomy,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst with Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “The
economy is slowing; demand is lackluster. We see  oil prices 
headed lower in the near term.”  Crude for July delivery on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange
fell as much as 54 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $96.51 a barrel and
was at $96.76 at 12:49 p.m. London time. The contract yesterday
declined $1.99, or 2 percent, to $97.30, the lowest settlement
since May 17. Futures have gained 29 percent in the past year.  Brent oil for July delivery was up 19 cents at $119.29 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The more
actively traded August contract gained 26 cents to $118.68. The
front-month European benchmark contract was at a premium of
$22.53 to U.S. futures after reaching a record $22.72 earlier.  Chinese Economy  “The market is concerned about economic growth,” said
 Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney, who predicted crude in New York will
average $100 a barrel this year. “The economics suggest oil
should be lower rather than higher.”  China’s Communist Party is seeking to tame inflation and
sustain growth after riots this month by migrant workers in the
manufacturing hub of Guangdong. The central bank has raised
 interest rates  four times since October to cool the economy.  Chinese refiners processed 38.5 million metric tons of
crude in May, 6 percent more than a year earlier, the China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today. Gasoline
output climbed 3.6 percent and diesel production rose 8.2
percent. China uses more oil than any country except the U.S.  U.S. advance retail sales probably dropped 0.5 percent last
month, according to the median estimate of 81 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before a Commerce Department report
today. Sales advanced 0.5 percent in April.  “Almost every day, there is some fresh economic data that
seems to fit better in an anemic recovery than in one that is
robust or dynamic,”  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover
Inc., an energy adviser in  New Canaan ,  Connecticut , said in an
e-mailed note.  Fuel Supplies  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably increased for a sixth
week last week, according to a Bloomberg News survey before an
Energy Department report tomorrow. Supplies rose 1 million
barrels from 214.5 million, based on the median estimate of
eight analysts. Crude inventories may have decreased 1.75
million barrels from 369 million, the poll showed.  Oil in New York is likely to remain in a “consolidation
range” of $95 to $105 a barrel, based on technical charts,
according to The Schork Group Inc.  A breach of yesterday’s low of $96.13 a barrel may indicate
prices will fall to $95.68 and $94.06, said  Stephen Schork ,
president of the consultant in Villanova, Pennsylvania. A
recovery to $98.10 will “clear a path” to $98.92 and $100.54,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
