Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in

2,705.43. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 1 percent to 2,963.12.  Banks:  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  (601288 CH) dropped
0.7 percent to 2.71 yuan. Industrial Bank Co. (601166 CH) lost

aside more deposits as reserves after consumer prices rose 5.5

the largest banks will rise by a half a percentage point to a
record 21.5 percent from June 20, while for smaller banks they
will climb to 19.5 percent.  Developers: China Vanke Co. (000002 CH), the nation’s

(600383 CH) retreated 1.6 percent to 6.09 yuan.  Standard and Poor’s cut its outlook for developers to

maker of power equipment, gained 1.5 percent, the most since May

Shanghai Electric will own 50 percent of the venture, which will
manufacture energy-saving and environmental products, it said.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor:  Matthew Oakley   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
