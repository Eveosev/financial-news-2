Rapeseed, or canola, stockpiles will
fall to a four-year low in the European Union, forcing
processors and biodiesel companies to import more or find
replacements for the oilseed, Oil World said in a report today.  EU rapeseed inventories in the year that ends on June 30,
2012, will total 1 million metric tons, the lowest level since
2008, Oil World data show. Output will total 18.9 million tons,
down 8.7 percent from the prior year, according to the report.
Dry weather in  France ,  Germany  and the U.K. will cut supply.  “In view of the corresponding decline in rape oil
production, consumers in the EU will be faced with tight
supplies and will have to struggle to cover their
requirements,” Oil World said. “It will be difficult for the
EU biodiesel industry to find sufficient feedstock.”  EU imports may rise 24 percent to 3.1 million tons,
according to the report. Purchases may exceed the record 3.24
million tons set in the 2008-09 marketing year, Oil World
said. The lack of supplies will slash EU rapeseed processing to
a three-year low of 21.3 million tons, and processors may use
more soy and palm oils, the company said.  “There is a relatively high risk that the global balance
of rapeseed could become tighter than we are currently assuming,
considering that several estimates in the trade suggest that
actual crops harvested in the EU-27 and  Canada  could turn out
below our current estimates,” Oil World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
