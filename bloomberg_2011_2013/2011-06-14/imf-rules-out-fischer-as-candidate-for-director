The  International Monetary Fund  said
that French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde and Mexican
central bank Governor Agustin Carstens are the two candidates to
become managing director of the group.  In an e-mailed statement, the Washington-based lender
omitted mention of Israeli central bank chief  Stanley Fischer ,
who had declared his candidacy last week even while exceeding
the age limit set by the IMF to become managing director. Former
Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned last month to
fight an attempted rape charge in New York; he has pleaded not
guilty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
