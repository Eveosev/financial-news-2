The  Federal Reserve  probably won’t
have a third round of asset purchases, known as quantitative
easing, unless the  U.S. economy  slips back into recession, said
China International Capital Corporation and Pacific Investment
Management Co.  “Politically, the bar is very high,” Matthew Nest, senior
vice president and head of account management at PIMCO’s  Hong
Kong  office said at a forum in the city today. “From the
perspective that we are not facing a deflationary spiral, at
least in a near-term, or a double-dip recession,” so further
easing is unlikely, he said.  Fed policy makers have tried to spur U.S. economic growth
by holding the main interest rate near zero since December 2008
and expanding its balance sheet to $2.79 trillion. Federal
Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said yesterday
policy makers have “done enough” on stimulus and should focus
on price stability.  In the absence of a “second dip” in the economy, the Fed
is unlikely to expand its assets purchases, said Aolin Liu,
executive director of Beijing-based CICC, referring to
additional quantitative easing. The “fear of inflation” is a
factor, she said.  Liu and Nest were both speaking at the Asia-Pacific Debt
Investor Forum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
