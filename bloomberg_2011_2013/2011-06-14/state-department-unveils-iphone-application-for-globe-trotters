The State Department released a
phone application for  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  devices today that gives globe-
trotters access to travel alerts, maps, U.S. embassy locations
and other details about countries, including crime and visa
requirements.  The free “ Smart Traveler ” application is compatible with
iPhones, iPod touches and iPads with operating systems 4.0 or
later. It is  available  for downloading at Apple’s online iTunes
store.  The application provides a wide array of material including
safety, security and general country background information.  The application also provides a link for travelers to
enroll in the State Department’s free Smart Traveler Enrollment
Program, which enables the department to locate and help
Americans overseas in the event of an emergency.  The agency will continue to make this information available
on its website  www.travel.state.gov .  To contact the reporter on this story:
