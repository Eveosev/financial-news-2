Turkey ’s benchmark share index may
fall below 61,500 after breaking through a key support level,
said Ahmet Fatih Gursoy, a trader at Is Invest, the country’s
biggest broker.  The gauge last slid below 62,500, which Gursoy calls a key
support level, on May 27, before falling to 61,491.71 on May 30.
Selling in the futures market may indicate the declines could
continue, he said.  “Downside momentum is increasing and sentiment is getting
worse,” he said. “It can go down to 61,500.”  Turkey’s  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  of stocks has fallen 5.8
percent this year, led by banks, as the central bank raised
 reserve requirements  by 10 percentage points since December. The
increases are meant to try and rein in a lending boom that’s
contributed to Turkey’s current-account deficit, which reached
$7.7 billion in April, the second-highest gap since records
began in 1984.  “Only an improvement in the current-account data can bring
it back up,” Gursoy said. “It’s hard to see any improvement
coming soon.”  Turkish stocks fell for a second day, slipping 2.1 percent
to 62,185.54 at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading. The ISE 30
Futures Index fell 2.8 percent to 75.425, its biggest intraday
decline in more than two weeks.  Raising reserve levels limits the money banks have to lend,
curbing profits at the companies which make up about 40 percent
of the benchmark gauge. Turkey’s banking index has fallen 12
percent this year, with its retreat weighing on the entire
index, Gursoy said.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the country’s biggest lender by
market value, led stock declines today, dropping 3.3 percent to
7.10 liras.  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , part-owned by Citigroup Inc., slumped
3.4 percent to 7.32 liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
