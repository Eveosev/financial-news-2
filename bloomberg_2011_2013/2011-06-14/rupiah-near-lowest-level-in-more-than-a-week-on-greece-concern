Indonesia’s rupiah traded near its
lowest level in more than a week as appetite for riskier assets
waned amid a deepening debt crisis in  Greece .  Global funds were net sellers of Indonesian shares
yesterday, offloading $6.4 million more stocks more than they
bought, according to exchange data. Standard and Poor’s cut
Greece’s rating to CCC from B yesterday, its lowest grade.  “With the euro zone problems, the market remains not
committed to doing anything at this point,” said  Gundy Cahyadi ,
an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in  Singapore .
“Risk aversion still remains the theme.”  The rupiah was little changed at 8,544 per dollar as of
8:52 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It dropped to 8,548 earlier, the lowest level since June 2.  The currency, which has gained 5 percent this year, will
continue to strengthen within a “limited range,” Bank
 Indonesia  Governor Darmin Nasution told reporters in Jakarta
yesterday.  Indonesia’s 10-year benchmark bond was little changed today.
The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 was at 7.39
percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
