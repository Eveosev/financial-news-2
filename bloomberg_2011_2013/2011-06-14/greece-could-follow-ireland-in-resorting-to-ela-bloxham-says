The  Bank of Greece  could follow
Ireland’s example and use an emergency liquidity program to keep
local lenders afloat if the  European Central Bank  rejected the
country’s collateral in the event of default, said  Alan McQuaid ,
chief economist at Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin.  “Under this scenario, the Greek central bank might provide
the country’s banks with funds through Emergency Liquidity
Assistance, a scheme which the Irish central bank has used to
support banks in Ireland,” McQuaid said in a note to clients.
“Such intervention could tide Greek banks over until Greece was
taken off ‘limited default’ status, allowing the ECB to resume
accepting Greek bonds as collateral.”  ECB officials including Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
have said that if Greece was declared to be in default, the
central bank could no longer accept Greek  government bonds  as
collateral in its refinancing operations. European finance
chiefs are in the final stages of negotiating  Greece ’s second
bailout in a year, after the country’s credit rating was
downgraded by Standard and Poor’s to the world’s lowest.  McQuaid said a so-called limited default, which would
involve Greece restructuring some of its obligations while
continuing to honor the rest, could “minimize the time which
Greece spent in default status.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
