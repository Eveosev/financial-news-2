Private investors should participate
in a solution for the Greek sovereign debt crisis once European
government and central bank officials agree on a plan to aid the
country, said Charles H. Dallara, managing director of global
banking lobby group  Institute of International Finance .  “Under the right circumstances, and if there were a common
front among European officials, the private sector should find
some way to help a Greek solution,” Dallara said at an event in
 Frankfurt  today. The IIF represents more than 400 financial
companies in more than 70 countries including  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc.  “I do believe that any approach to so-called private
sector involvement would have to avoid even a technical
default,” Dallara said. He said he doesn’t expect  Greece  to
default, and that the country doesn’t pose a direct threat to
the viability of the European banking system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
