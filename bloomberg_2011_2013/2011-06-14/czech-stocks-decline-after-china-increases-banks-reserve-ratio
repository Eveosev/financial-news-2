The Czech Republic’s benchmark stock
index fell, snapping a two-day gain, after the Chinese central
bank today increased the reserve requirement ratio for banks.  The PX gauge of companies slumped 0.5 percent to 1,220.7 by
9:43 a.m. in  Prague , after advancing 1.6 percent in the previous
two sessions. Power utility  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and  Central European Media
Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)  dropped more than 1 percent each.  China raised the ratio by 50 basis points effective June 20
to rein in inflation, the People’s Bank of China said on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
