Dubai Aluminium Co., the developer
of the world’s largest smelter of the metal, is seeking to mine
bauxite in  Guinea  in partnership with BHP Billiton Ltd., as well
as sourcing the raw material from Cameroon and  India .  “One of our projects is in Guinea together with BHP
Billiton,” Sultan Al Sabri, general manager of marketing and
sales, said in Barcelona today. “We’re looking at Cameroon.”
Talks in Orissa, India, “didn’t really move forward much
because of lack of support from local officials,” he said.  The company’s Emirates Aluminium Co. joint venture with Abu
Dhabi state-run investor Mubadala Development Co. will double
annual capacity to 1.5 million metric tons by March 2015, Chief
Financial Officer Bill Campbell said in an interview.  Aluminum producers are seeking to secure sources of raw
materials as costs increase, squeezing margins. Gulf states also
aim to develop aluminum production as they diversify away from
oil and gas exports, and demand for the metal climbs.  Dubal may combine with its joint venture under a holding
company. “Cooperation and synergy between the two companies is
aimed at bringing benefits of technology, production and
marketing of the metal under one roof,” Campbell said. Mubadala
may also buy a stake in Dubal, he said, declining to elaborate.  Dubal has marketed about 1.7 million tons of aluminum to be
produced by the two companies this year, Al Sabri said. “The
market is strong and stable for the next few years,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
