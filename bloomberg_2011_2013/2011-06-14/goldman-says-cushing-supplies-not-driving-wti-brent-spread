The record discount of West Texas
Intermediate crude to North Sea Brent is widening because of
flows of light, sweet crude to  Europe  and  Asia  instead of the
U.S. Gulf Coast, Goldman Sachs said in a note.  The growing price gap “has been primarily driven by the
weakening of U.S. Gulf Coast light-sweet crude oil prices
relative to Brent crude, not a Cushing bottleneck,” Goldman
analysts including  David Greely  said today, referring to the
delivery point for the WTI contract in Cushing, Oklahoma.  “The arbitrage between the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe has
flipped, and the market is now directing light-sweet crude oil
away from the U.S. Gulf Coast and toward Europe and Asia,”
Goldman said. That caused Brent’s premium to widen in June and
reach a record close of $21.80 a barrel yesterday, the bank
said.  Downside risk for the WTI-Brent spread is “limited” in
the near term, Goldman said. The analysts expect the difference
to narrow and said they would not make a trading recommendation
on it because “the risk associated with the fundamental
uncertainty is too high.”  The reversal of the arbitrage was caused by lower prices
for Louisiana Light Sweet grade relative to  Brent crude , which
makes it more attractive for traders to ship top-quality oils to
Europe and Asia than the U.S.  WTI crude moved into discount versus North Sea Brent in
August amid a glut of stockpiles at Cushing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
