Greece â€™s central-government budget
deficit widened in the first five months of the year as the
larger-than-forecast recession hit tax revenue.  The shortfall, which excludes outlays by state-owned
institutions and companies, increased to 10.3 billion euros
($14.9 billion) from 9.1 billion euros a year earlier,
preliminary data released today by the Athens-based  Finance
Ministry  showed.  Net revenue decreased 7.1 percent to 18.4 billion euros,
falling short of the target included in the 2011 budget plan by
1.9 billion euros. The ministry blamed the drop on the
recession, the absence of road-tax fees collected in January
last year and an increase in rebates to people who paid too much
tax in 2010.  Ordinary spending increased 6.4 percent between January and
May to 27.6 billion euros, compared with a budget target of
26.6 billion euros, the statement said.  Final central government data are due on June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
