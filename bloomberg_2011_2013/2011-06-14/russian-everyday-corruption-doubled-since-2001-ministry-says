Russians paid at least 164 billion
rubles ($5.9 billion) in bribes last year to buy off teachers,
traffic policemen and others in “everyday” situations, almost
double the level in 2001, the  Economy Ministry  said.  The overall “market” for bribes, excluding corruption and
kickbacks related to business, reached 129 billion rubles in
2005 from 84.8 billion rubles in 2001, Deputy Economy Minister
Oleg Fomichev told reporters in Moscow today.  Russia  is the world’s most corrupt major economy, according
to Transparency International’s 2010  Corruption Perceptions
Index  issued in October, sliding to 154th among 178 countries,
alongside Tajikistan and  Kenya . President  Dmitry Medvedev , a
former lawyer, has made tackling graft and bureaucracy key goals
of his presidency, advocating stronger legal institutions and
greater respect for the law.  The average bribe paid last year was 5,285 rubles, Fomichev
said. Corruption was most widespread in universities, followed
by traffic police, army conscription and payoffs for admittance
to kindergarten, he said.  The results are encouraging except for the fact that people
have become “far more accustomed” to corruption, Fomichev
said. The number of bribes fell to 31 million last year, from 46
million in 2005, the ministry estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
