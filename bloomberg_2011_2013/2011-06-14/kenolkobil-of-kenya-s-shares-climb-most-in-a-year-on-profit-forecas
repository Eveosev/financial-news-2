KenolKobil Ltd., a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, rallied the
most in almost eight months after saying it expects to report
first-half net income rose more than 50 percent.  The company’s stock rose 6.2 percent to 10.30 shillings by
the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the biggest jump since
Oct. 26.  KenolKobil’s profit growth is boosted by geographical
expansion and an improved focus on certain business lines, the
company said yesterday. The earnings will be released July 26,
it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
