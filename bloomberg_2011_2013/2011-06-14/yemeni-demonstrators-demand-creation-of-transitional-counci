Tens of thousands of protesters
gathered in Sana’a to demand the formation of a transitional
council to run  Yemen  after President Ali Abdullah Saleh left to
receive medical treatment in Saudi Arabia.  As they marched toward Vice President Abduraboo Mansur Hadi’s house, the demonstrators chanted: “The people want a
transitional council” and “No dialogue with the remnants of
the regime.” They demanded Hadi support their revolt and called
for the prosecution of officials from Saleh’s regime.  The organizing committee of the Popular Youth Revolution
said in an e-mailed statement read to protesters that any
agreement stemming from talks with “remnants” of Saleh’s
regime would be “illegitimate.” Hadi would be “accountable”
for “any crimes committed by the remnants and sons of Saleh”
against protesters, according to the statement.  Saleh is recuperating in  Saudi Arabia  after surgery for
injuries sustained during the June 3 bombing of a mosque in his
presidential compound in Sana’a, the capital. After months of
anti-government protests, fighting in the Arabian Peninsula
country escalated when Saleh refused to sign a Gulf Cooperation
Council plan calling for him to step down within 30 days and
turn leadership over to Hadi in exchange for immunity from
prosecution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
