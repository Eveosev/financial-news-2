Crude oil rose the most in almost
four weeks in  New York  as U.S. retail sales fell less than
expected and equities rallied.  Crude climbed 2.1 percent after purchases dropped 0.2
percent in May, less than economists estimated, Commerce
Department figures showed in  Washington . The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index advanced the most since April. New York-traded oil
touched a record discount to  London ’s Brent.  “The market was bracing itself for something worse,” said
 Matt Smith , a commodities analyst for Summit Energy Services
Inc. in Louisville,  Kentucky . “Equities are off to a decent
rally. Buying interest is coming into the crude complex.”  Crude for July delivery gained $2.07 to settle at $99.37 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in the biggest one-
day increase since May 18. Futures have climbed 32 percent in
the past year.  Prices climbed from the settlement after the  American
Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles decreased 3.03 million barrels to 363 million, the
lowest level in seven weeks. July oil rose $2.10, or 2.2
percent, to $99.40 a barrel in electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  Brent oil for July delivery rose $1.06, or 0.9 percent, to
$120.16 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The front-month European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $20.79 to U.S. futures after reaching a record $22.79
in intraday trading.  Retail Sales  U.S. retail sales fell last month for the first time since
June 2010. The decline was less than the median forecast for a
0.5 percent drop in a Bloomberg News survey of economists, as
consumers weathered elevated gasoline costs, the Commerce
Department figures indicated. Excluding the biggest slide in
auto sales in more than a year, purchases climbed 0.3 percent.  The  S&P 500 index (SPX)  rose 1.3 percent to 1,287.87 in New York,
the biggest one-day rally since April 20. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 123.14 points, or 1 percent, to
12,076.11.  The dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.4444 per euro at 4:33
p.m. in New York. A weaker dollar boosts the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment.  Oil declined as much as 0.8 percent earlier today after the
U.S. Labor Department reported wholesale prices rose more than
forecast in May and as China raised its  interest rates .  The U.S. producer-price index increased 0.2 percent amid
higher costs for fuel, more than the 0.1 percent median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Oil futures, which climbed to a 32-month high of $114.83 a
barrel in May in New York, are “hurting” the global economy
and may stall its recovery, said  Fatih Birol , chief economist at
the  International Energy Agency .  China  Reserves  China, the world’s largest energy user, ordered lenders to
set aside more cash as reserves after inflation accelerated to
the fastest pace in almost three years.  “We remain under pressure with the economic data being
what it is,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC,
a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “The market
rallied off the economic data, but the Chinese are continuing on
their tightening pace.”  China’s Communist Party is seeking to tame inflation and
sustain growth after riots this month by migrant workers in the
manufacturing hub of Guangdong. The central bank has raised
interest rates four times since October to cool the economy.  Oil Processing  Chinese refiners processed 38.5 million metric tons of
crude in May, 6 percent more than a year earlier, the China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today. Gasoline
output climbed 3.6 percent and diesel production rose 8.2
percent. China uses more oil than any country except the U.S.  “The Chinese economy in terms of year-on-year GDP growth
is still going to be a steamroller,” said Jason Schenker,
president of Prestige Economics LLC in Austin,  Texas . “The
question is how big.”  U.S. crude inventories probably decreased 1.8 million
barrels to 367 million, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
13 analysts before an Energy Department report tomorrow.
Supplies fell to a five-week low in the prior period.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably increased for a sixth
week last week, gaining 1.05 million barrels to 215.5 million,
the poll showed. Demand for gasoline tumbled 2.8 percent to 9.16
million barrels a day in the week ended June 3, the department
reported last week. It was the biggest decline since the seven
days ended March 11.  Gasoline Rises  Gasoline for July delivery gained 6.78 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $3.0646 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
settlement price since May 31.  Oil in New York is likely to remain in a “consolidation
range” of $95 to $105 a barrel, based on technical charts,
according to The Schork Group Inc.  A breach of yesterday’s low of $96.13 a barrel may indicate
prices may fall to $95.68 and $94.06, said  Stephen Schork ,
president of the consultant in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . A
recovery to $98.10 will “clear a path” to $98.92 and $100.54,
he said.  Oil futures in New York have traded between $95 and $105
since May 9.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 666,,525
contracts as of 4:34 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 816,715
contracts yesterday, 24 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.59 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
