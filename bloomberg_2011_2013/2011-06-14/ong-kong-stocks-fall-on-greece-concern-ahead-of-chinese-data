Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell,
erasing earlier gains, as  China  increased the reserve ratio for
major banks after government reports showed inflation
accelerating to the fastest pace in almost three years.  Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) , China’s largest retailer
of women’s shoes by market value, fell 2 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,
China’s biggest offshore oil producer by market value, lost 1.2
percent after crude prices declined. China Coal Energy Co., a
Beijing-based producer, gained 1.8 percent after saying output
in May increased.  “The market will fluctuate in the coming few months,”
said Lewis Wan, chief investment officer at Pride Investments
Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. “A lot of enterprises are facing a lot
of issues because China is trying to control inflation by
limiting loan growth, and by doing so, larger companies are
being hurt.”  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.1 percent to 22,496 at the 5 p.m.
close in Hong Kong, after gaining as much as 0.6 percent. The
gauge has fallen every day but one this month. The Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’ H shares rose 0.5
percent to 12,488.27.  Belle International declined 2 percent to HK$15.52.  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) , China’s biggest Internet company by market value,
dropped 2.5 percent to HK$201.40.  Reserve Requirements  China raised banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis
points effective June 20, the People’s Bank of China said on its
web site today, after inflation accelerated to the fastest pace
in almost three years in May.  Consumer price index rose to 5.5 percent last month,
China’s statistics bureau said in Beijing today, matching the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
Industrial output grew 13.3 percent last month, exceeding the
13.1 percent median forecast of economists.  Cnooc declined 1.2 percent to HK$18.48 and PetroChina Co.,
the nation’s largest oil company, slid 0.6 percent to HK$10.70.
Crude oil for July delivery dropped 2 percent to $97.30 a barrel
in  New York  yesterday, the lowest settlement since May 17.  Nine Dragons Paper Holdings Ltd. (2689) , the paper-products
company owned by China’s richest woman, was suspended from
trading after tumbling as much as 22 percent. Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services withdrew its ratings on the company’s debt,
saying it had “insufficient access to management and therefore
cannot fully understand the company’s strategy and financial
management or assess its future credit risks.”  China Coal  The Hang Seng Index has fallen 2.3 percent this year on
concern that tightening measures by China will cool economic
growth. Shares in the gauge traded about 12.1 times forecast
earnings on average, compared with 14.4 times at the end of last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Among stocks that rose, China Coal gained 1.8 percent to
HK$10.32, the biggest increase in the Hang Seng Index, after
saying output in May climbed 11.5 percent from a year earlier.  Property developers led earlier gains as the value of
China’s real estate sales climbed.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a
state-controlled developer, gained 0.9 percent to HK$13.20.
Guangzhou R&F Properties Co., the biggest real-estate company in
the southern Chinese city, jumped 4.5 percent to HK$10.06 after
BNP Paribas Securities SA raised its rating on the stock to
“buy” from “hold.”  The value of China’s property sales for the period from
January through May of this year gained 18 percent, according to
the  National Bureau of Statistics.   Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.3 percent to 22,491.
The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong Kong
stock options, declined 4.2 percent to 18.67, indicating options
traders expect a swing of 5.4 percent in the Hang Seng Index in
the next 30 days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
