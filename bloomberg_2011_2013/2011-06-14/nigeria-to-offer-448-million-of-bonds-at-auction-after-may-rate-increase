Nigeria will offer 70 billion naira
($448 million) of bonds at a monthly debt auction tomorrow,
after the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for
the third time this year in May to curb inflation.  The West African country will sell 35 billion naira each of
debt due in 2014 and 2015, the Abuja-based  Debt Management
Office  said in a  statement  published on its website. Demand for
the notes due 2015 exceeded supply by the most since September
at the last sale on May 16.  The inflation rate of  Africa ’s top oil producer declined to
a revised 11.3 percent in April from 12.8 percent a month
earlier, the statistics agency said on May 18. Central bank
Governor Lamido Sanusi on May 24 raised the benchmark interest
rate, lifting it half a percentage point to 8 percent to
stabilize the naira and slow inflation, which the bank aims to
bring below 10 percent.  “The risk is that inflation for May could print higher
this week and peak for this year, pushing yields further up in
the secondary market from their current levels,”  Samir Gadio , a
London-based emerging-market strategist at Standard Bank Group
Ltd., said by e-mail today. “The main caveat is that the CBN is
likely to raise rates further in July and tighten liquidity.”  The federal government’s 4 percent bonds due April 2015
yielded 12.74 percent in the secondary market yesterday,
according to data on the the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association’s website . That compares with a 12.68 percent yield
a week earlier. The 10.5 percent bonds due March 2014 yielded
11.53 percent yesterday, unchanged from a week earlier.  “Inflation will probably fall to single digits by
December,” said Gadio. “In such a context, investors should
probably play the interest rate and inflation cycle -- buy now
in the primary market or post-auction in the secondary market --
and sell in July when a lower June inflation figure is released
and prior to the MPC scheduled for next month.”  Nigeria issues sovereign bonds on a monthly basis to
support the domestic  bond market , assist in monetary control and
fund government deficits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
