Liberia will receive $46.5 million
to increase crop production by farmers in the West African
nation, the Inquirer newspaper reported, citing Finance Minister
Augustine Ngafuan and Agriculture Minister Florence Chenoweth.  The funds, from the Washington-based  Global Agriculture and
Food Security Program , may create 70,000 jobs over the next 10
years and 19,000 low-income farmer households will benefit, the
Monrovia-based newspaper cited the lawmakers as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
