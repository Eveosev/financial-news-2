Khiem Do, the Hong Kong-based head
of multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd., which
oversees about $10 billion, comments on the outlook for  China’s
economy . He spoke in a telephone interview today.  Inflation accelerated by the fastest pace in almost three
years and industrial output grew more than economists forecast,
data released today showed. The benchmark Shanghai Composite
Index jumped 0.9 percent as of 11:10 a.m. local time, set for
the steepest rally since May 31.  “More sensible investors know China will continue to grow.
Even a slow pace of growth for China is 8 to 9 percent. Those
who think China is falling off the cliff are really in a big
minority. Very few people truly think that and are acting on
it.”  “At this point of the economic cycle, where  China  is
experiencing bottle necks in the production of food stuffs and
energy, a moderate slowdown is good news.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
