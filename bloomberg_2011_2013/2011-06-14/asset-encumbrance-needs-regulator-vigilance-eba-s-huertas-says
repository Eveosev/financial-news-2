Regulators must pay increasing
attention to debt encumbrance, where holders of asset-backed
securities or covered bonds have rights to certain pools of
collateral, according to Thomas Huertas, alternate chairman of
the European Banking Authority.  Huertas was speaking at the Global ABS 2011 conference in
Brussels today.  On encumbrance:  “Supervisors need to pay increasing attention to asset
encumbrance.”  “There is a limit how far collateralization can go,
without significantly raising the risk to deposits and other
senior obligations of the bank.”  “There is some evidence that some investors treat covered
bonds as if they were senior to unsecured bonds.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
