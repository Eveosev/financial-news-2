U.K. Treasury Minister Mark Hoban
said plans to phase out bank checks should be frozen until
lenders can come up with viable alternatives that won’t hurt
consumers or companies.  Any alternatives should be easy to use, widely available
and cost-effective, and speed clearing times of the existing
system, Hoban said in a letter to Parliament’s cross-party
Treasury Committee that was released by his office in  London 
today.  “Until this is demonstrated, I do not believe that there
is a coherent case for abolishing checks,” Hoban said. The
government will “intervene to protect vulnerable individuals
and businesses if there is any threat that checks could be
withdrawn without suitable alternatives.”  Usage has declined since 1990, when 4 billion checks were
written, to about 1.1 billion last year, Hoban said, citing the
Payments Council. He said banks should consider whether
replacing the existing system may not be more costly than
reforming it.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , the owner of the NatWest
consumer bank, said it has no plans to abolish checks at the
moment.  “RBS NatWest is not going to get rid of checks unless
there is a viable alternative and unless customers are ready for
it,” Brian Hartzer, Chief Executive of RBS Retail, said in a
statement released by his office today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
