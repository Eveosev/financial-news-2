The pound strengthened against the
dollar after a report showed U.K. inflation held at the fastest
pace since October 2008 in May, stoking bets that the Bank of
England will raise  interest rates .  The pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.6403 at 8:25 a.m. in
 London . It was little changed against the euro at 88.12 pence.  U.K. government bonds stayed lower, with the 10-year yield
three basis points higher at 3.28 percent. The two-year note
yielded 0.85 percent.  Short-sterling futures slipped, signalling traders were
adding bets on an increase in U.K. borrowing costs. The implied
yield on the June 2012 contract rose one basis point to 1.2
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
