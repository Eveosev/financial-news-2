The center of global economic
gravity is heading south from the U.S. and Europe as a network
of trading routes connecting Asia, the Middle East, Latin
America and Africa develops, said Stephen King,  HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA) ’s chief economist.  Writing in the Financial Times, King said 36 percent of
Brazil’s trade is intercontinental “south-south” trade, and
that proportion may rise well above 50 percent by 2050.  Some of the biggest mergers and acquisitions are taking
place on a south-south axis; the $7.1 billion purchase of a
stake in  Repsol YPF SA (REP) ’s Brazilian unit by  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (386)  was Brazil’s second-biggest such transaction last
year, he said.  High levels of Chinese savings will lead to infrastructure
investment that will transform economic conditions in Latin
America, the Middle East and Africa, as has happened in China’s
eastern provinces, King said.  Since China offers the world’s biggest investment market
and its households account for almost as much of global consumer
spending as the U.S., many southern nations see China offering
better trade opportunities than the U.S. or  Europe , King
concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
