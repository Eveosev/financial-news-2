The Moroccan central bank held its
benchmark interest rate at the lowest level in more than two
years as prices declined.  The Rabat-based  central bank , which meets every three
months to review monetary policy, left its key rate at 3.25
percent, according to an e-mailed statement today.  “Inflation is low and growth is likely to be impacted by
recent political developments,” Mohamed Abu Basha, an economist
at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, a Cairo-based investment bank, said
in e-mailed comments. Abu Basha forecast the bank would keep the
rate unchanged.  Demonstrations began in  Morocco  on Feb. 20 demanding more
freedoms and an end to corruption, after revolts that unseated
the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt . In April, the annual inflation
rate was -0.3 percent, compared with 0.6 percent the month
before. Morocco’s economy may expand 4.6 percent this year,
compared with 3.3 percent in 2010, the state statistics office
said in March.  Headline inflation may accelerate to 2.4 percent in the
third quarter of 2012, the bank said in its statement. The
inflation forecast for 2011 was revised down to 1.4 percent from
the 2.1 percent forecast earlier, the bank said, citing a
“sharp decline in food prices between January and April.”  Explaining its decision to maintain the rate, the bank said
that “the central inflation forecast remains consistent with
the price-stability objective and the balance of risks is
slightly tilted to the upside.”  The central bank last changed its interest rate in March
2009, lowering it by quarter of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
