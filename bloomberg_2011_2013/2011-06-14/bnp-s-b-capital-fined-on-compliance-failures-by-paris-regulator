B*Capital, an investment management
unit of  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, was fined by  France ’s financial markets
regulator over inadequate internal controls and record-keeping,
and missed client notifications.  B*Capital was fined 50,000 euros ($72,420) for compliance
failures uncovered during a review by the Autorite des Marches
Financiers ordered in November 2008, the regulator said today in
a  decision  posted on its website.  Sandrine Ferre, a spokeswoman for B*Capital, said the group
hadn’t decided whether to appeal the decision and that the AMF
did not find any harm to clients in its investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
