The U.S. Treasury Department’s
undersecretary for international affairs,  Lael Brainard , said
today in response to a question about keeping the  World Bank ’s
top post in U.S. hands that the institution has “benefited
tremendously” from U.S. leadership.  “We believe that the World Bank has benefited tremendously
from American leadership over the past several decades,”
Brainard said during a hearing of the House Financial Services
Committee panel that oversees development banks. Current World
Bank President Robert Zoellick “is doing an excellent job,”
she said.  Her comments come as the U.S. has yet to choose whether to
support French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  or  Mexico ’s
central bank governor Agustin Carstens for the top post at the
 International Monetary Fund .  Favoring a non-European would end a 65-year-old unwritten
agreement that puts a European in charge of the IMF and has the
U.S. pick the head of the World Bank. Members of Congress who
decide on funding for development banks have said they aren’t
ready to accept giving up the top position at the World Bank.  Congress has yet to approve the Treasury Department’s $3.4
billion international aid budget for next year, which includes
funding for a capital increase at four development banks and for
the World’s Bank’s unit for the poorest nations. Brainard today
urged lawmakers to authorize this extra expenditure or face a
decline in U.S. influence at the institutions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
