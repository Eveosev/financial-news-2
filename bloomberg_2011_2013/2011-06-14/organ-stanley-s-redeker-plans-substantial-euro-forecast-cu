Hans Redeker, who was hired as
 Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s head of foreign-exchange strategy in March,
said he plans to revise the bank’s euro forecast “substantially
lower” on weak demand for European bonds and equities.  “Net flows into the longer-term bond segment are near
historical lows and at odds with the current value of the euro”
amid the Greek debt crisis, Redeker wrote in a research report
dated yesterday. “European equity markets have lost ground. The
relative underperformance compared to the U.S. market indicates
that long-term capital flows should remain euro-negative.”  Morgan Stanley’s current estimates for the euro are that
the 17-nation currency will rise to $1.52 by the end of the
third quarter, then trade at $1.49 and $1.47 at the end of the
fourth quarter and the first quarter next year respectively.
“We will take these numbers substantially lower,” Redeker said
in an e-mailed response to questions today.  The euro was 0.3 percent stronger at $1.4452 as of 8:50
a.m. in  London .  “While short-term yield differentials correlate best with
euro-dollar, we regard it as a mistake to ignore messages sent
out by other market segments,” he wrote in the report. “Should
nervous euro money-market investors turn around, the euro will
fall.”  Morgan Stanley said on March 31 that it hired Redeker from
BNP Paribas SA as managing director and global head of foreign-
exchange strategy. The bank also hired  Ian Stannard  from BNP
Paribas as head of European foreign-exchange strategy. Both will
be based in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
