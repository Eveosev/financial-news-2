Russia  will probably grant tax
discounts to small oil fields as the world’s largest crude
producer seeks to stimulate output, said Deputy Energy Minister
Sergei Kudryashov.  A proposal to lower the mineral extraction tax for deposits
with less than 5 million metric tons of reserves is being
considered by Russian lawmakers in the State Duma and has met no
opposition, Kudryashov said in an interview in St. Petersburg
late yesterday, without giving a timeframe.  Petroneft Resources Plc (PTR) ,  Volga Gas Plc (VGAS)  and Exillon Energy
Plc may benefit more than Russia’s largest producers from such
tax breaks because the London-listed oil producers and explorers
focus on developing resources at fields smaller than the 50
million-ton reserve limit that Russia classifies as
“strategic.”  Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  has called on
producers to maintain output at more than 10 million barrels a
day for at least a decade even as older deposits go into
decline. Russia may have 1 billion tons (7.33 billion barrels)
of reserves spread over thousands of small deposits, Deputy
Finance Minister Sergei Shatalov said in March. That is
equivalent to almost 9.5 percent of Russia’s proved reserves,
according to BP Plc data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
