European Union carbon allowances
dropped 1.1 percent in  London  to the lowest level in more than
two weeks as coal advanced, making the dirtier-burning fuel less
profitable for power utilities.  EU carbon for December fell 19 cents to close at 16.50
euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange, the
lowest price since May 26.  Coal for next year in northwest Europe advanced 0.5 percent
to $132 a ton, its highest price since May 4, according to data
from brokers. The spread between spot EU permits and United
Nations offsets on BlueNext in Paris narrowed after yesterday
reaching the widest since the contract was introduced in October
2009. It shrank 2.2 percent to 4.06 euros a ton.  Power utilities need about double the volume of carbon
allowances when burning coal instead of cleaner-burning gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
