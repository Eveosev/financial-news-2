Canadian oil flowing into the
central U.S. should continue to swell stockpiles, widening the
record differential between  New York  and London futures,
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said in a report.  The opening of an extension of the 591,000-barrel-a-day
Keystone pipeline to Cushing,  Oklahoma , will lower the relative
value of West Texas Intermediate oil, JPMorgan analysts led by
New York-based Lawrence Eagles said today in the report.
Canadian producers cut output earlier this year because of lower
prices and full tanks in the central U.S, the analysts said.  “One factor that helped provide a floor to the North
American market earlier this year was the cutback in Canada as a
result of full inventories and steep discounts,” the analysts
said. “Now that WTI is hovering near $100 a barrel, a greater
discount will be needed to shut-in production, especially
considering the augmented transit on the Keystone system.”  TransCanada Corp. completed filling the extension of the
pipeline to the hub in February.  Crude oil for July delivery rose 85 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $98.15 a barrel at 10:31 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , while Brent oil for July delivery climbed $1.49, or
1.3 percent, to $120.59 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The spread between the grades widened to a record
$22.44 a barrel today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
