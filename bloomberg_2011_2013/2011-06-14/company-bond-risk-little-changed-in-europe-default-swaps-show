The cost of insuring against default
on  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  rose above record closing
prices, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  Greece climbed 12 basis points to 1,622, Ireland increased
3 to 743 and Portugal was 5 higher at 767, according to CMA. The
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell 2 basis points to 216.  The cost of insuring European corporate bonds fell.
Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 7 basis points
to 399, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 12:30 p.m. in
London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1.75 basis points to 108.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers declined 1.5 basis points to 164 basis
points, and the subordinated index rose 1.5 to 289.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
