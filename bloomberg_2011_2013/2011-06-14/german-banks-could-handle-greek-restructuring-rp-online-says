Most German banks could withstand a
Greek debt restructuring, Christoph Schmidt, an economic adviser
to  Chancellor Angela Merkel , told German website  RP Online .  A “soft restructuring” would do little to alleviate
Greece’s debt burden and sooner or later creditors, including
the  European Central Bank , will have to write off part of their
Greek sovereign debt, Schmidt told the website.  Such a debt overhaul for Greece wouldn’t necessary trigger
contagion to Ireland and Portugal, Schmidt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
