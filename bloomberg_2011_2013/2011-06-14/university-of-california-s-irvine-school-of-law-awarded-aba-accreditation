The  University of California , Irvine
School of Law has been granted provisional accreditation by the
 American Bar Association , the school said in an e-mailed statement.   ``The ABA’s decision puts the official seal of approval on 
the hard work of scores of faculty, administrators, students, and
supporters—both on campus and in the legal community,'' said Dean 
Erwin Chemerinsky. ``It’s the culmination of years of planning 
and execution.''  The law school opened in 2009. Law schools are eligible for 
provisional accreditation after two years, and full accreditation 
after five, according to the statement.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
