Wylfa’s 245-megawatt unit 4 at the
nuclear reactor in Anglesey, Wales, halted today and is expected
to restart within the week, according to Magnox North Ltd.  The site has four units owned by the Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority and operated by Magnox North Ltd. The
units are powered by two reactors.  Units 3 and 4 “have been brought offline due to on-going
maintenance with conventional plant,” Dan Gould, a Warrington,
England-based spokesman for Magnox North said today by e-mail.
“We expect both units to return to  service  within the week.”  The U.K. can get about 20 percent of its power from nuclear
sources, so changes in operations can influence power prices.
The unit halted at about 4 a.m.,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
