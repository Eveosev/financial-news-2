South Korea  plans to set measures
meant to control the country’s record level of household
borrowing this month, the financial regulator said.  Household debt, which has risen eight straight quarters to
801.4 trillion won ($739 billion) as of March, “may potentially
disrupt our economy,” the Financial Services Commission stated
in an e-mailed copy of its parliamentary report.  The measures are aimed at slowing the pace of debt growth
and improving financial companies’ “ability to absorb potential
losses,” the financial regulator said without elaborating.
South Korean household debt grew 12.7 percent on average every
year between 2000 and 2010, it said.  The ratio of household liabilities to disposable income was
153 percent in 2009 in South Korea, above the 133 percent
average for member economies of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
