Slovakia’s central bank expects the
economy in the eurozone member to advance faster than previously
predicted, citing external demand.  The bank sees the economy expanding 3.6 percent this year,
up from 3.3 percent predicted three months ago, Renata Konecna,
the director of the central bank’s monetary department said at a
news conference in Bratislava, Slovakia, today. The bank also
revised its growth forecast for 2012 to 4.7 percent from 4.5
percent, while the prediction for 2013 was raised to 5.3 percent
from 5.2 percent.  Faster-than-expected growth combined with rising commodity
prices will fuel prices, the central bank said, revising its
inflation forecasts for this and next year upwards. Average
inflation will accelerate to 4.1 percent in 2011, compared with
a previous forecast of 3.8 percent, before slowing to 3.3
percent in 2012. The forecast for 2013 was cut to 2.5 percent
from 2.9 percent.  “Exports will remain the main driver of growth,” said
Jozef Makuch, the central bank’s governor. “The contribution of
domestic demand to growth will be limited.”  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, is relying on
foreign demand for its products such as cars assembled by a
Volkswagen AG’s Slovak unit, to drive the economy. Domestic
consumption, which has been hurt by unemployment and
government’s austerity measures, is set to accelerate from next
year as companies are expected to add jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
