Wealth management firms may have
“significant widespread failings,” the U.K.’s  Financial
Services Authority  said in a letter to chief executive officers
of companies in the industry.  The British regulator said a survey of 16 unidentified
firms found that 14 were judged to pose a high or medium-high
risk of detriment to their customers.  The FSA said some firms didn’t keep up to date records
about their clients’ financial situation and didn’t match their
portfolios to the amount of risk their clients wanted to take.
The watchdog said it’s “concerned” the list of shortcomings
may be “prevalent” in companies beyond the sample.  “The key focus of the review was to assess suitability of
client portfolios against documented client information,”
 Margaret Cole , head of the FSA’s conduct business unit, said in
the letter. The FSA reviewed customers’ “knowledge and
experience, financial situation and investment objectives,”
Cole said.  Hector Sants, the FSA’s CEO, has promised a more
“intrusive” approach to supervision after the U.K.’s financial
watchdog was blamed for not doing enough to prevent the
financial crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008.  “You should be aware that we consider suitability -- and
the ability to demonstrate it -- a key area of risk,” Cole said
in the letter. “Wealth management businesses can expect to see
continuing and increasing supervisory focus on these issues in
the year ahead.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
