The New Zealand dollar was little
changed after a government report showed retail sales rose 0.9
percent in the first quarter, adjusted for inflation, meeting
economistsâ€™ expectations.  The currency traded at 81.91 U.S. cents as of 10:49 a.m. in
Wellington, from 81.88 cents before the data was released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
