Talaat Moustafa Group Holding filed
a complaint with the public prosecutor against Hamdy El
Fakharany, a private citizen, accusing him of spreading
“rumours that negatively impact” company shareholders,  Al
Ahram  reported, without saying how it received the information.  The complaint stated that Fakharany cited data and figures
about the company without having any evidence, the Cairo-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
