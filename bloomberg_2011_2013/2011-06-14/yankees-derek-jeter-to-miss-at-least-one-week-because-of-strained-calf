Derek Jeter ’s pursuit of a 3,000th
career hit will be delayed for at least a week by a right calf
injury.  The New York Yankees shortstop was injured during last
night’s 1-0 loss to the  Cleveland Indians , when he collected his
2,994th hit. He’s six shy of becoming the 28th player in Major
League Baseball history with 3,000 hits, and the first to do so
as a member of the Yankees.  Jeter, the Yankees’ captain, will need at least seven days
to recover and may be placed on the 15-day disabled list,
manager  Joe Girardi  told reporters. Jeter is scheduled to meet
with a doctor tonight, the Yankees said on their website.  Jeter, 36, left yesterday’s game after the fifth inning and
was replaced by Eduardo Nunez, who is starting at shortstop
tonight against the  Texas Rangers .  The Yankees already have 10 players on the disabled list,
including pitchers Joba Chamberlain, Bartolo Colon, Phil Hughes,
Rafael Soriano and Pedro Feliciano. Catcher Russell Martin has
missed five of the team’s past six games with a back injury.  After the conclusion of their current three-game home
series against the Rangers, the Yankees have a six-game road
trip to Chicago and Cincinnati, before returning to New York for
three games against the Colorado Rockies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
