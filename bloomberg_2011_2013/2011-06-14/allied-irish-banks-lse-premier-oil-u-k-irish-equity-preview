The following is a list of companies
that may have unusual share-price changes in U.K. and Irish
markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses and prices are from
the last market close.  Futures on the benchmark FTSE 100 Index retreated 0.4
percent to 5,787.5 at 7:49 a.m. in  London . The FTSE 100 gained
29.67, or 0.5 percent, to 5,803.13 yesterday. The FTSE All-Share
Index rose 0.5 percent to 3,031.97. Ireland’s ISEQ Index
advanced 0.5 percent to 2,921.55.  African Barrick Gold Ltd. (ABG)  : Tanzanian lawmakers
approved a five-year development plan that includes a proposal
for a so-called super-profit tax for mining companies, an
official in the African country’s presidency said. The shares
lost 1.8 percent to 398.9 pence.  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  : The Dublin-based,
government-controlled lender said it may gain at least 1.6
billion euros ($2.3 billion) in capital from a buyback of junior
bonds, as it imposed losses of as much as 90 percent on
investors. The shares fell 1.2 percent to 16.7 euro cents.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  : The U.K.’s third-largest
supermarket chain reported first-quarter sales growth that
missed analysts’ estimates as customers monitored their spending
amid higher fuel prices.  Sales at stores open at least a year increased 1.9 percent,
excluding fuel. That missed the median estimate of nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News for growth of 2.1 percent. Revenue
climbed 1 percent on the same basis in the previous quarter. The
shares rose 0.1 percent to 326.8 pence.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  : The London
exchange won an employment lawsuit filed by Eli Lederman, the
former chief executive officer of the exchange’s Turquoise unit.
The stock advanced 2.1 percent to 968.5 pence.  Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  : The U.K. crude and natural gas
explorer said that partners in the Huntington oil field may have
to lend $40 million to Sevan Marine ASA to allow the Norwegian
company to deploy a production vessel. The stock gained 2.2
percent to 479.8 pence.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  : Britain’s
biggest government-owned bank has taken control of 42 Marriott-
branded hotels across the U.K and appointed Ernst & Young as the
receiver for the hotel owner.  RBS assumed control of the 1 billion-pound ($1.6 billion)
property portfolio after failing to obtain a debt-for-equity
restructuring of one of its largest real-estate loans, the
Financial Times reported, without saying where it got the
information. The shares rose 2.4 percent to 41.6 pence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
