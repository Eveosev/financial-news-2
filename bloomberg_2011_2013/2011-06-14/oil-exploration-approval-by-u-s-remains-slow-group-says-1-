The Obama administration remains
slow in approving plans for deep-water oil exploration in the
 Gulf of Mexico , according to the  American Petroleum Institute ,
the largest energy trade organization in the U.S.  The government sent back at least 20 plans, saying company
calculations of the worst-case oil spill isn’t meeting standards
set by  the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
Enforcement , said Erik Milito, the institute’s director for
upstream and industry operations.  “Where we’re seeing the bottleneck is with the continued
recycling of the exploration plans,” Milito said today on a
conference call with reporters. “We believe we need to move
forward at a better pace.”  The U.S. approved permits for 16 wells in waters deeper
than 500 feet (152 meters) after lifting a drilling ban that
followed BP Plc’s record offshore spill in April 2010. The
ocean-energy bureau added requirements such as a subsurface oil
spill containment system, to prevent similar disasters.  The regulator is “constantly looking for ways to create a
smarter, more efficient, and more transparent,” review process,
Michael Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, said in an e-mailed statement on June 3.  The agency released a checklist this month to help
offshore-oil operators submit complete applications to drill.  American Petroleum Institute , based in Washington, includes
among members the largest energy company  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and
peers such as  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
