The U.S. entertainment and  media
industry  last year grew 3.1 percent, its first gain since 2007,
as marketers returned to advertising online and on television,
according to the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  The U.S. media sector, which includes movie studios, TV
networks,  radio stations , newspapers and the Internet, will grow
3.5 percent this year, New York-based PWC forecast today in its
annual industry overview.  Online advertising and Web access, pay-TV subscriptions,
billboards and movies will lead the industry to mid-single-digit
percentage gains between 2012 to 2015, PWC said. Spending on
recorded music and newspapers will be lower in 2015 than in
2010. Overall growth will average 4.6 percent compounded
annually, with sales rising to $555 billion in 2015 from $443
billion in 2010, according to PWC’s report.  Digital products will account for 59 percent of worldwide
growth in the media industry during the next five years, while
they contribute about 25 percent now, PWC said. In the U.S.,
digital products will account for 29 percent of entertainment
and media spending in 2015, compared with 21 percent last year.  U.S. advertising spending climbed 5.4 percent in 2010 after
declining 14 percent in 2009, PWC said. Overall advertising will
increase at a 4.2 percent compound annual rate to $208 billion
in 2015 from $170 billion in 2010.  Online advertising will average 12 percent growth
compounded annually, while video games and movie theater
advertising, the two smallest segments, will grow by 8 percent
and 6.7 percent, respectively, on a compounded annual basis, PWC
said.  TV advertising , the largest category, is expected to grow
at 4.9 percent. Spending on newspaper ads will shrink 0.2
percent, along with directories, the only advertising categories
