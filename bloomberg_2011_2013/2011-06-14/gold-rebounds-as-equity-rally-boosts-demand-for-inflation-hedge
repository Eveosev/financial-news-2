Gold rebounded from a three-week low
on speculation that an improving global economy will spur
inflation, boosting demand for the precious metal as a hedge.  The MSCI All-Country World Index and the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index gained today after reports showed Chinese industrial
output and U.S. retail sales topped economists’ estimates.
Before today, gold slumped 2 percent in the past week, dropping
yesterday to $1,511.40 an ounce, the lowest since May 23.  “Gold is embracing the inflationary discussion,” said
 Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
 Chicago . “The huge rally in the S&P gave gold the risk-on
attitude that it so dearly needed. Gold is acting more as a
reflection of the growth element in the economy.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $8.80, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $1,524.40 at 1:55 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The metal has advanced 7.2 percent this year, reaching a
record $1,577.40 on May 2.  The  Federal Reserve  has kept its benchmark interest rate at
zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and pledged to
buy back $600 billion in U.S. Treasuries by the end of June to
revive the economy.  “The worry in metals seems to be centered on the health of
the global economy,” said Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF Global
Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 67.4 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $35.411 an ounce on the Comex. The price has gained
14 percent this year.  Palladium futures for September delivery dropped $7.60, or
0.9 percent, to $792.75 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for July delivery fell $11.90, or 0.7
percent, to $1,794.90 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
