U.K. Foreign Office Minister
Alistair Burt urged  Sri Lanka  to initiate an “independent,
thorough and credible investigation” into allegations that war
crimes were committed during the conflict in the country that
ended in May 2009, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in
an e-mailed statement.  Burt commented after watching a Channel 4 television
documentary titled “Sri Lanka’s Killing Fields,” about which
he said he was “shocked by the horrific scenes,” the statement
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
