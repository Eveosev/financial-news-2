The pound strengthened against the
dollar before a report that’s forecast to show U.K. inflation
stayed at the fastest since October 2008 in May.  U.K. government bonds declined. Consumer prices probably
rose 4.5 percent for a second month, according to the median
estimate of 30 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the
data. That’s more than twice the Bank of England’s 2 percent
target. The central bank last week held its key rate at a record
low 0.5 percent to bolster the recovery.  The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.6430 at 8:25 a.m. in
 London . It was little changed against the euro at 87.95 pence.  The yield on the 10-year gilt rose four basis points to
3.29 percent. The two-year note yield gained three basis points
to 0.88 percent.  The U.K. plans to auction 2.25 billion pounds ($3.7
billion) of debt maturing in 2027 tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
