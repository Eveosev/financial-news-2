The Czech financial system faces
increased risks stemming from economic developments in the
country’s main trading partners, the central bank said.  The  Czech Republic ’s financial system remains stable,
mainly thanks to sufficient profitability and capital adequacy
as well as good balance-sheet liquidity, the Prague-based Ceska
Narodni Banka said in an update of the financial stability
report published on its  website .  “The intensity of risks faced by the domestic financial
system has increased compared with the previous year as a result
of adverse fiscal developments in the euro area and their
potential impact on the domestic economy,” the bank said. “The
main risk scenario for the Czech economy over the next two years
remains a sharper slowdown in economic growth in  Germany  and
other countries” that are major markets for Czech exports.  The Czech Republic didn’t have to bail out any banks during
the global financial crisis as their exposure to toxic assets
accounted for less than 1 percent of all assets, banks had a
liquidity surplus and deposits exceeded loans, according to
central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
