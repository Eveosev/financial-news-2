Indian stocks rose, lifting the
benchmark index higher for the first time in five days, as
speculation monsoon rains will boost agricultural output,
potentially slowing inflation.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., India’s largest maker of tractors,
gained 1.1 percent as the nation’s agriculture secretary said
wheat production may advance to a record for a fourth year.  ITC
Ltd. (ITC) , a consumer goods company, climbed the most in two weeks.
 Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the nation’s largest engineering company,
advanced 1.1 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 42.63, or 0.2 percent, to 18,308.66 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, with two stocks rising for each one that fell.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.1 percent, gaining for the
first time in five days, after a Chinese industrial production
report exceeded economists’ forecasts.  “It looks like a monsoon rally,” said  Arun Kejriwal , a
director at Kejriwal Research & Investment Services Pvt. in
Mumbai. “Support from other Asian markets has helped. But
investors are still skeptical as inflation,  interest rates  and
economic slowdown concerns are still there.”  The Sensex has lost 11 percent this year, the most among
benchmark Asian gauges tracked by Bloomberg, amid concern higher
borrowing costs will crimp earnings. The  Reserve Bank  of India
may boost borrowing costs on June 16 for the 10th time since
mid-March 2010 to curb inflation, 15 of 17 economists in a
Bloomberg survey said.  Monsoon Rains  The Sensex pared an increase of 0.6 percent today after the
government reported that its wholesale-price index rose 9.06
percent from a year earlier after an 8.66 percent jump in April.
The median estimate of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
was for an 8.74 percent increase. Stocks also trimmed gains as
 China  raised the amount banks have to hold in reserve.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.3 percent to 5,500.50, after climbing 0.7 percent. The BSE 200
Index gained 0.3 percent to 2,281.30 rupees.  Mahindra gained 1.1 percent to 671.65 rupees amid
speculation higher agricultural output will boost demand for its
tractors.  Investors have been monitoring  monsoon rainfalls  this month
to gauge the strength of agricultural production, which accounts
for a fifth of  India ’s economy. Monsoon rains have been 6
percent above average since June 1, the nation’s weather bureau
reported yesterday.  Farm Output  Production of corn, a crop sown during India’s monsoon
season, may climb 7 percent from a record in the year ending
June, said Gagan Gulati, the head of the grains business at Olam
International Ltd.’s Indian unit. Wheat output may climb 6.4
percent to 86 million metric tons in the year ending June 30,
India’s Agriculture Secretary P.K. Basu said in an interview
yesterday in  New Delhi .  “With good rainfall, inflation will come down and that
will have a positive impact on stocks,” Anita Gandhi, director
at Arihant Capital Markets Ltd., said yesterday.  “The growth and inflation trade-off is getting
increasingly challenging,” Sudhakar Shanbhag, who manages about
$1.8 billion in assets as Mumbai-based chief investment officer
at Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Ltd., said in an e-
mail. “The stance from the  Reserve Bank of India , based on
their expectation on growth and inflation, may still lean
towards controlling inflation.”  The Indian economy may be “overheating” and further rate
rises are warranted,  Nouriel Roubini , co-founder and chairman of
Roubini Global Economics LLC, said yesterday.  ITC rose 1.6 percent to 193.85 rupees and its June futures
traded at 194.80 rupees. The stock is the best performer among
the 30 Sensex shares, with an 11 percent advance this year.  ‘We’re Bullish’  Larsen climbed 1.1 percent to 1,727.45 rupees.  ICICI Bank
Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-biggest lender, added 1.5 percent to 1,055.55
rupees and its June futures traded at 1,061.20 rupees.  Declines in the Sensex have dragged the average valuation
of its companies to 14.8 times estimated profit, down from 21.5
times in March 2010, last year’s high. The MSCI Emerging Markets
Index trades at 10.9 times earnings.  “We’re bullish and see value at current levels with a nine
to 12-month perspective,” Manoj Singla, managing director and
co-head of research at Religare Capital Markets Ltd., said in
Mumbai. He recommends DLF Ltd., India’s biggest developer, as
the stock that may rebound.  DLF gained 1.3 percent to 232.05 rupees. The shares closed
yesterday at the lowest level since May 27.  Overseas investors sold a net 4.7 billion rupees ($105
million) of Indian stocks on June 10, paring their investment in
the equities this year to 2.02 billion rupees, according to data
on the  website  of the market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
