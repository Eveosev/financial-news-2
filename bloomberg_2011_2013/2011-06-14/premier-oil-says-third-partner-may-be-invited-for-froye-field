Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  said an additional
partner may be brought in to speed up development of Norway’s
offshore Froye field that’s expected to pump its first oil as
early as 2014.  An investment decision will be made this year, said Simon Lockett, chief executive officer of Premier Oil, which shares
the development equally with  Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA (DETNOR) , a
Norwegian explorer. The field holds about 60 million barrels of
recoverable oil, according to Det Norske’s  website .  Det Norske has “got too many things to do for them in one
go and therefore needs to reduce their equities in one or two of
their projects,” Lockett said today in an interview in  London .  Premier expects to reduce its stake in the field to about
40 percent in favor of a new partner, Lockett said. Froye may
pump as much as 35,000 barrels of oil a day with development
costs of around 3 billion kroner ($560 million), Det Norske’s
CEO Erik Haugane said in November.  The partners have yet to agree on the Froye development and
Det Norske may reduce its stake, Haugane said when contacted
today. “We will be pragmatic about” transferring the
operatorship of the project should that be required, he said.  The partners may use  Sevan Marine ASA (SEVAN) ’s floating,
production, storage offloading vessel for the project should the
Norwegian company resolve its current financial difficulties,
Lockett said.  “They’ve got a couple of more hauls half-built in  China 
and it could be accelerated,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
