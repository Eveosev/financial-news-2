Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  said euro-area finance ministers will meet on June 19
in Luxembourg to continue their discussion of a second bailout
for  Greece .  “Finding a solution for the mid-term concerning Greece
will still take a bit of time,” Reynders told reporters after
initial talks in Brussels today. “We always said this wasn’t a
decisive meeting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
