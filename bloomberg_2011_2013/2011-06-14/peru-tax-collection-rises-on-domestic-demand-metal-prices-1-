Peru  tax collection climbed 17
percent last month as rising domestic demand for goods and
services offset a cut in the sales tax, the government said.  Tax collection rose to 5.87 billion soles ($2.1 billion)
last month from 4.88 billion soles in the same month a year
earlier, the state tax and import duty collection agency known
as  Sunat  said in an e-mailed statement.  Sales tax collection rose 24 percent from a year earlier,
the steepest rise in nine months, fueled by imports that reached
a record $3.35 billion in May. Income tax revenue grew 25
percent after higher metal prices lifted mining companies’
profits, the agency said.  Peru’s rising tax revenue combined with slower growth in
public spending will boost the fiscal surplus to 5 percent of
gross domestic product by July 28, when President-elect Ollanta Humala takes office, Finance Minister Ismael Benavides told
reporters in  Lima  today. The government posted a budget deficit
equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP last year.  The government cut the  sales tax  to 18 percent from 19
percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
