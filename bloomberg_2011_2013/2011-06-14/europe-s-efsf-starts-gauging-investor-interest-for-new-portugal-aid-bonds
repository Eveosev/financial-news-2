The  European Financial Stability
Facility  started gauging investor interest for its 5 billion-
euro ($7 billion) bond sale to raise money for  Portugal ’s aid
program, according to two people with knowledge of the sale.  The AAA rated fund overseen by euro-area countries is
issuing 10-year notes in its second sale, EFSF said in a June 10
 statement . The notes may be priced to yield about 16 to 18 basis
points more than the benchmark swap rate, said the people, who
declined to be identified as the matter is private.  The Luxembourg-based EFSF first sold bonds Jan. 25, when it
raised 5 billion euros from a sale of five-year notes that were
priced to yield 6 basis points more than swaps, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The sales follow two transactions by the European Union’s
European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism in May, which raised
a total 9.5 billion euros to help finance the bailouts of
Ireland and Portugal. The European Union increased its borrowing
forecasts for the EFSM and the EFSF on  May 19  after Portugal
joined Ireland in seeking aid.  The EFSF hired  Barclays Capital , Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC
Holdings Plc to manage the sale of the 10-year notes. The fund
also expects to sell 3 billion euros of five-year bonds “before
the summer break,” the EFSF said in a June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
