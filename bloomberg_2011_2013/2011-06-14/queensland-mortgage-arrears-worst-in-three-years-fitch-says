Mortgage delinquencies in the north-
eastern Australian state of Queensland have risen to the highest
in more than three years as floods and higher  interest rates 
pushed up arrears,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Some 2 percent of mortgages in Queensland were in arrears
in the six months to March 31, compared with 1.54 percent six
months earlier, the highest since the ratings company starting
publishing the reports in November 2007, Fitch said in an e-
mailed report. Across  Australia , 1.76 percent of loan repayments
were late by 30 days or more as of March 31, according to the
data, which represents about 17 percent of mortgages in the
country.  “The Queensland floods have partially contributed to the
increase in arrears,” analysts led by James Zanesi, associate
director at Fitch, wrote in the report. The variable performance
is a reminder to investors in residential mortgage backed
securities “that the geographic diversity of the portfolio is
an important attribute to be considered.”  Queensland’s capital city Brisbane saw  home prices  fall 3.1
percent in the three months to April, compared with a national
drop of 1.2 percent, according to figures from real estate
researcher  RP Data . Almost two months of flooding at the start
of 2011 inundated about 40,000 homes in Brisbane.  Victoria was the best-performing state, with delinquencies
at 1.34 percent, and New South Wales saw arrears rise to 1.93
percent, Fitch said. Arrears rose in all six Australian states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
