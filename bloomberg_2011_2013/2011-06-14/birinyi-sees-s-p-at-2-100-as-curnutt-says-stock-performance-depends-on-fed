Birinyi Associates Inc.’s Jeffrey Yale Rubin said the firm remains bullish on equities this year,
while Dean Curnutt of Macro Risk Advisors LLC says stock
performance depends on the actions by the  Federal Reserve .  “For the remainder of the year, we’re positive,” Rubin
said today at a panel discussion on equities at the Bloomberg
Money Managers conference in Boston. For the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index, “we have a target of 2,100 but that’s not this year,
that’s not next year. When we look at stock markets that go on
for a long period of time, that start off quickly -- 1974, 1982,
2009 -- those markets are not ones that end quickly. If you also
look at those markets during this period, phase two of the
market, it runs into difficulty.”  The forecast represents a 65 percent gain from the  S&P
500 ’s closing level of 1,271.83 yesterday, and a 34 percent
advance from the gauge’s record high of 1,565.15 reached in
October 2007.  The S&P 500 and  Dow Jones Industrial Average  have fallen
six straight weeks, the longest streaks since 2008 and 2002,
respectively, as reports on jobs and manufacturing spurred
concern that the global economy is slowing. The S&P 500 is still
up 90 percent since its low in March 2009. Equities have risen
since August, with the S&P 500 up 23 percent since Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  signaled the central bank would provide stimulus
measures to boost the economy.  S&P at 2,854  In January,  Laszlo Birinyi , one of the first money managers
to advise buying U.S. stocks before they bottomed in March 2009,
said the S&P 500 will rally to 2,854 on Sept. 4, 2013. Westport,
Connecticut-based Birinyi Associates analyzes historical charts
and patterns to make forecasts.  Curnutt, the New York-based chief executive officer of
Macro Risk, said the firm’s view on stocks is “largely
conditional” on the next policy response by the U.S. central
bank. The Fed’s $600 billion program of buying Treasuries to
stimulate the economy is ending this month. The S&P 500 could
rise to 2,100 if the Fed decided it wanted it to, he said at the
conference.  “One of the problems we’re having is asset prices are
necessarily imposed with a tremendous amount of artificiality
from the Fed, from the fiscal response,” Curnutt said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
