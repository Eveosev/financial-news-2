Omen International Ltd., the second-
highest bidder for Nigerian Telecommunications Ltd. last year,
has until tomorrow to pay a $105 million bid security for the
state-owned company, the privatization agency said.  Nigeria  will consider other options, including liquidating
Nitel, as the company is known, and a negotiated sale, if Omen
doesn’t meet the deadline, Bola Onagoruwa, director-general of
the Bureau of Public Enterprises, told reporters today in Abuja,
the capital.  Omen had written to the agency to say the payment was made
on June 10 and that the money would be received by tomorrow, he
said.  Nigeria’s privatization agency invited Omen International
to confirm its bid on March 14 after the New Generation Group
was unable to meet payments on its winning bid for the phone
company. Omen International had bid $956 million for Nitel in
February 2010, behind New Generation Group’s $2.5 billion offer.  Omen had asked for an extension until June 10, Onagoruwa
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
