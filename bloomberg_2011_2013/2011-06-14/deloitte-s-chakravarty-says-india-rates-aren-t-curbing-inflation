Anis Chakravarty, an economist at
Deloitte Haskins & Sells, comments on  India ’s inflation rate.
The wholesale-price index rose 9.06 percent in April from a year
earlier, the government said today. The median forecast of 22
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 8.74 percent
increase. Chakravarty spoke in a phone interview.  “The central bank has intervened through rate increases
three times this year and yet inflation has consistently been
above estimates and well above our comfort level for all the
months except one in April.  ‘‘This probably is the time for policy makers to try new
price stability mechanisms. The interest rate increases aren’t
having the desired effects. If they think inflation is more
because of supply side concerns then they should get to the root
cause of the issues.  ‘‘I expect the central bank to announce a quarter
percentage point increase in  interest rates  at its mid-quarter
review on June 16. The move after that will depend on how the
monsoon pans out.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
