Grupo Modelo SAB de CV discussed
with its board of directors a proposal to make a joint bid for
 Foster’s Group Ltd. (FGL) , though didn’t put it up for a vote at a
June 13 meeting, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  Modelo may still be considering an offer for Foster’s, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the matter is
private. Modelo would need to win support from Anheuser-Busch
InBev AB, which has 9 seats on Modelo’s 19-person board and
holds a 50 percent non-controlling stake in the Mexican brewer.  Modelo has been talking with Molson Coors Co. about a joint
offer for Foster’s, people familiar with the matter said earlier
this month.  A spokeswoman for Modelo wasn’t immediately available after
regular business hours. The Wall Street Journal reported on the
board meeting earlier today.   To contact the reporter on this story:
