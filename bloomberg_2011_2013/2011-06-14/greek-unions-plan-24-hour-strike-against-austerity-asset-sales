Greece ’s ports, banks, hospitals and
state-run companies will be brought to a halt tomorrow as the
two biggest labor unions strike to oppose Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s budget cuts and asset sales.  ADEDY , the largest public-sector union, and the  General
Confederation of Labor , or GSEE, the biggest private-sector
union, have called the third general strike of the year in
protest at the government’s five-year fiscal plan and program of
state asset sales, according to e-mailed union statements.  The 78 billion-euro ($113 billion) package, which includes
sales of state holdings in companies and lower public-sector
wages, was submitted to parliament on June 9, after approval by
the cabinet. The measures are aimed at getting more aid after a
110 billion-euro, EU-led bailout, agreed in May last year,
failed to secure  market access  for Greek bonds in 2012.  Public-sector workers, hospital employees, bank workers,
police officers and journalists will participate in the 24-hour
strike. Ferry schedules will be disrupted and work stops will
take place in public transit during the day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
