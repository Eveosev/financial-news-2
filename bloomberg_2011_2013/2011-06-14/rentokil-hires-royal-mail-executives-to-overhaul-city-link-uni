Rentokil Initial Plc, the world’s
largest pest-control company, has hired two former  Royal Mail 
executives to head up its City Link parcel-delivery unit.  David Smith , who joined the state-owned mail company almost
a decade ago, will join as managing director of City Link,
accompanied by Robert Peto as finance director, the London-based
company said in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Alan Brown took over the day-to-day
running of City Link after ousting its management late last
year. Continuing losses at City Link led Rentokil to report a
9.9 percent drop in first-quarter profit to 27.4 million pounds
($45 million).  Smith, a chartered accountant, joined Royal Mail in 2002
and has been chief customer officer for the U.K. operation since
the end of 2010. Peto has served as the finance director of
Parcelforce, the Royal Mail’s competing delivery service, since
2006.  To contact the reporters on this story:
