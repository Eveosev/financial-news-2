The Australian dollar climbed,
erasing earlier declines, after data showed  China ’s inflation
accelerated to the fastest pace in almost three years and
industrial output grew more than economists forecast.  The so-called Aussie gained to $1.0620 as of 12:10 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0602 in New York yesterday and as low as $1.0569
earlier today.  New Zealand ’s dollar rose 0.3 percent to 81.78
U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
