Greek government bonds slumped,
leading the securities of  Europe ’s most indebted nations lower,
after  Standard & Poor’s  gave the country the world’s lowest
credit rating amid speculation it’s moving closer to a default.  The losses pushed the extra yield, or spread, that
investors demand to hold the country’s 10-year bonds instead of
similar maturity German bunds to a record. Declines drove up
Portuguese 10- and two-year yields to the highest since the
euro’s debut. German bunds slid for the first time in four days
as stocks rose, snapping gains that pushed the yield to its
lowest level in five months yesterday.  “Markets are fearing that a Greek default will become a
reality,” said  Glenn Marci , a strategist at DZ Bank AG in
 Frankfurt . “If it’s not the Greek topic, then it’s always stock
markets at the moment. It’s just a question of whether we want
to take risk or not.”  The Greek two-year yield increased 28 basis points to 26.42
percent as of 4:33 p.m. in London. The 10-year yield rose for a
sixth day, increasing 40 basis points to 17.38 percent. The
Portuguese 10-year yield climbed six basis points to 10.73
percent. The two-year yield rose 21 basis points to 12.08
percent, after being as high as 12.20 percent.  Portugal faces the repayment of 4.9 billion euros ($7
billion) of a 5.15 percent bond maturing tomorrow.  Ministers Meeting  The  European Financial Stability Facility  started gauging
investor interest for its 5 billion-euro bond sale to raise
money for  Portugal ’s aid program, according to two people with
knowledge of the sale. The AAA rated fund overseen by euro-area
countries is issuing 10-year notes in its second sale, EFSF said
in a June 10  statement .  The spread between Greek 10-year bonds and benchmark German
debt widened to 1,446 basis points, the most since the euro was
introduced in 1999. Portuguese 10-year bonds yielded 771 basis
points more than bunds.  European finance chiefs are meeting in Brussels today, in
an effort to narrow differences on how investors share the cost
of easing the region’s biggest debt burden. They aim to wrap up
a new financing plan at a leaders’ summit on June 23-24 and
prevent the euro area’s first sovereign default.  Greece  sold 1.625 billion euros of 182-day Treasury bills
at a yield of 4.96 percent. Investors bid for 2.58 times the
amount of securities offered, compared with a bid-to-cover of
3.58 at the previous sale of similar-maturity securities held
May 10, which were allotted at 4.88 percent.  CDS Costs  S&P cut Greece’s rating yesterday to CCC from B, reflecting
“our view that there is a significantly higher likelihood of
one or more defaults,” it said in a statement.  Costs to insure Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt against
default reached all-time highs, according to traders of credit-
default swaps. Greece climbed 12 basis points to 1,622 basis
points, Ireland increased 3 to 743 and Portugal was 5 higher at
767, according to CMA.  Greek government debt has lost investors 16 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. German bonds
returned 0.5 percent while Treasuries made 3.2 percent.  The 10-year German bund yield rose six basis points to 3.01
percent. It reached 2.94 percent yesterday, the lowest since
Jan. 12. The 3.25 percent security due July 2021 fell 0.485, or
4.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.005. Yields on
two-year notes added five basis points to 1.59 percent. They
dropped to 1.51 percent yesterday, the least since March 17.  Germany  is scheduled to sell an additional 6 billion euros
of two-year notes tomorrow, while Portugal plans to auction 98-
and 189-day Treasury bills.  Stocks Gain  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.8 percent, while the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares rose 1 percent, as reports
showed  China ’s inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in
almost three years in May and industrial production rose more
than estimated.  Italian five-year bonds advanced after the nation sold 3.5
billion euros of 3.75 percent notes maturing in April 2016. The
yield slipped three basis points to 3.97 percent. Investors bid
for 1.28 times the amount of debt on sale, compared with a so-
called bid-to-cover ratio of 1.45 at the previous auction of the
same securities held May 13.  “This is not a stellar auction, but Italy managed to sell
the maximum of the amount announced,” said  Chiara Cremonesi , a
fixed income strategist at UniCredit SpA in  London . “As the
debate on Greece is going on, the mood in the market is very
fragile and quite uncertain. The timing of the auction is
awkward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
