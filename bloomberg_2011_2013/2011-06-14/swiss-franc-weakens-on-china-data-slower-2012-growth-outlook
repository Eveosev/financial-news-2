The  Swiss franc  weakened as
investors sought higher-yielding assets after  China ’s industrial
output topped economists’ estimates and Switzerland’s government
cut its 2012 growth forecast.  The franc fell versus all of its 16 major peers monitored
by Bloomberg. German bonds fell and European equities advanced
as the Chinese data curbed investor demand for assets perceived
to have the least risk. Swiss gross domestic product will rise
1.5 percent next year instead of the 1.9 percent projected in
March, and the franc’s appreciation poses risks to the outlook,
the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Bern said today.  “We saw a little bit of risk being put back on the table;
that’s part of the reason we’re seeing euro-Swiss franc
higher,” said  Daragh Maher , deputy head of global foreign
exchange strategy at Credit Agricole CIB in  London . “Unless
it’s sufficiently onerous that they’re tempted to actively
weaken the Swiss franc,” government forecasts won’t have “that
much bearing on the currency,” he said. “The global news is
more important.”  The franc weakened 0.5 percent to 1.2131 per euro as of
11:12 a.m. in London. The currency yesterday strengthened to a
record 1.2004 per euro.  Against the dollar, the franc was 0.3 percent weaker at 84
centimes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
