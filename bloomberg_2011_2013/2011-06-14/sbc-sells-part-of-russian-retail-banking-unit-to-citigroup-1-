HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest
bank, is to sell part of its Russian consumer banking business
to  Citigroup Inc. (C)   The sale of the business, whose assets are valued at about
$10.7 million, will be closed in the third quarter of the year,
the London-based bank said in a statement today. HSBC in April
said it would close its retail and private-banking units in
 Russia  to focus on corporate clients as domestic lenders gain
market share.  State-run banks led by OAO Sberbank and VTB Group are
expanding their corporate and brokerage businesses, squeezing
out international competitors as the Kremlin seeks to turn
Moscow into a global financial center. Britain’s Barclays Plc,
Spain’s Banco Santander SA, Morgan Stanley of the U.S. and
 Sweden ’s Swedbank AB, are among foreign competitors who have
either quit or curtailed Russian retail operations since 2010.  “In order to assist its customers, HSBC Russia will also
refer the holders of current and deposit accounts upon their
consent to Citibank, which intends to offer them new account
facilities,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
