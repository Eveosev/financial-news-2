Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
after  BP Plc (BP)  shut a fluid catalytic cracker at its Texas City,
Texas, refinery.  BP shut the No. 1 FCCU yesterday after an electrostatic
precipitator stack tripped due to the loss of a blower,
according to a filing with state regulators.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf Coast narrowed 1.25 cents to 2 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:08 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained
8.03 cents to $3.0446 a gallon.  The same fuel strengthened on the East Coast after Irving
Oil Corp. suffered a  power failure  at its Saint John refinery in
New Brunswick. The outage at about 11:30 a.m. local time
affected several units at the plant, Jennifer Graham, a
spokeswoman for the  New Brunswick  Department of the Environment,
said in an e-mail.  Reformulated gasoline in New York Harbor increased 3.5
cents to a premium to futures of 8 cents a gallon. Itâ€™s the
highest level since May 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
