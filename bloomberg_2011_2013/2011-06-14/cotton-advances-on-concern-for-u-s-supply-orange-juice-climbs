Cotton gained for the fourth time in
five sessions on speculation that supply may trail demand in the
U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  Orange juice  also climbed.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its outlook for
domestic cotton production last week to 17 million bales. It was
the first time the government lowered its June forecast from May
since 1998. Crops in  Texas , the biggest producing state, are
suffering after the state’s worst drought in more than a
century, and prices have increased 66 percent in the past year.  “People really overestimated what the U.S. crop is going
to be,” said Louis Barbera, a broker with VIP Commodities in
New York. “They’re estimating about 17 million bales in the
last USDA report, when in fact we’re looking at more like 15.
The Texas crop is looking at losing 2 million bales alone.”  Cotton for December delivery rose 0.2 cent, or 0.2 percent,
to settle at $1.3178 a pound at 2:35 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York .  Orange-juice futures for July delivery rose 2.8 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $1.8595 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
