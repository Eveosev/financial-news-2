Shareholders in  Diageo Plc (DGE) ’s
Ghanaian unit approved a rights offer to raise 70 million cedis
($46.2 million) to pay debt and invest in infrastructure, said
David Harlock, the company’s chairman.  The price and number of shares in the offer, which is open
to existing  Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd. (GGBL)  investors, will be
given when the offer starts in early September, Harlock said at
a shareholders’ meeting in Accra, the capital, today. It will
close in October, he said.  Guinness, which makes the popular stout in the West African
nation along with Star lager and over beverages, will spend 40
million cedis to pay down debt stock, which stood at 70 million
cedis in the nine months to March, said Harlock. Another 29
million cedis will be spent on infrastructure, water supply and
electricity at the company’s plants, he said.  Guinness  Ghana ’s shares rose 1 pesewa, or 0.8 percent, to
1.31 cedis by 2:40 p.m. in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
