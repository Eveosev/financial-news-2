Madagascar’s army and police are
opposed to  Marc Ravalomanana , the exiled former president,
returning to the country, said Andre Ndriarijaona, the head of
the army in the Indian Ocean island nation.  The army and police are “strongly opposed” to the 
immediate return of Ravalomanana as it may cause unrest,
Ndriarijaona told reporters today in the capital, Antananarivo.  A summit of Southern African Development Community heads of
state agreed on June 12 that Ravalomanana, ousted by President
Andry Rajoelina with the help of the army in 2009, should be
allowed to return to the country before elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
