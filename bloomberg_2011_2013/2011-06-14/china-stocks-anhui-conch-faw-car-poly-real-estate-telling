“pessimistic expectations” about the industry and recent
declines provide a buying opportunity, according to China

sell 20 railway ammonia tank cars and 20 liquefied gas tank cars
to  France ’s Atir-Rail, according to a statement on the company’s
website.  China Coal Energy Co. (601898 CH), the nation’s second-
