Adam Matthews, managing director at
JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd., comments on the outlook for
Indian stocks. He spoke at a press conference in Mumbai today.  “In next 3 to 5 years, we expect  India  to be able to
generate 20 plus percent earnings-per-share growth. We had a
modest downgrading of our medium-term, earnings-per-share
forecast. The downgrade was modest as compared to the rest of
 Asia  and certainly the rest of the world.  ‘‘We still retain infrastructure beneficiaries, industrials
and cement stocks in our portfolio. Themes we have been playing
in last five years include power equipment, cement, consumption,
and bank stocks.  ‘‘We see stalling of infrastructure building a short-term
phenomenon. Infrastructure is still the most important growth
driver in India over the next 5 to 10 years. We are bullish on
coal.  ‘‘We’d like to see inflation starting to abate. We are
seeing evidence inflation starting to tail off in India. We’d
like to see wage price inflation moderating in India and  China .  ‘‘China is better than India on valuation perspective. We
are overweight on China as it got cheap. Twelve months back,
everybody was worried  consumer price index  will creep to 5
percent to 6 percent. But government stimulus packages and
administrative mechanism controlled CPI and growth started to
moderate. Investors are now talking about a hard landing in
China. Investors never seem to be satisfied with China’s GDP
growth.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
