Treasuries fell, pushing the 10-year
note yield to the highest level in almost two weeks, as retail
sales dropped in May less than economists forecast and producer
prices rose more than projected.  Government debt slid earlier as China’s retail sales and
industrial output increased last month. Federal Reserve Bank of
 Dallas  President  Richard Fisher  reiterated yesterday that policy
makers have “done enough” on stimulus and should focus on
 price stability .  “It’s relatively bearish economic data for Treasuries
across the board,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S.
government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based
brokerage for institutional investors. “We sold off pretty
nicely.”  The yield on the 10-year note increased eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage pointn, to 3.06 percent at 9:14 a.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data prices. The 3.125
percent security due in May 2021 slid 21/32, or $6.56 per $1,000
face amount, to 100 17/32.  The 10-year note yields touched the highest level since
June 1 after falling last week to 2.92 percent, this year’s low.
Two-year note yields advanced four basis points to 0.43 percent.
A one-point drop in the 30-year bond pushed the yield to 4.26
percent.  Retail sales dropped 0.2 percent in May after a 0.3 percent
increase in the previous month, the Commerce Department
reported. The median forecast of 81 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 0.5 percent decrease.  Wholesale Prices  Wholesale prices in the U.S. rose last month more than
forecast, led by higher costs for fuel and the fastest rise in
30 years for apparel and textiles.  The 0.2 percent increase in the producer-price index
compares with the 0.1 percent median forecast of economists, the
Labor Department reported. The so-called core measure, which
excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent,
matching projections.  China ’s industrial production grew 13.3 percent last month,
compared with the 13.1 percent median forecast of economists.
Consumer-price inflation accelerated to 5.5 percent, the fastest
pace in almost three years. China raised banks’ reserve
requirement ratio by 50 basis points, effective June 20.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1
percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares rose 1.1 percent,
and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.7 percent.  Quarterly Rally  Treasuries have rallied this quarter as weak economic
reports encouraged speculation that the central bank will keep
borrowing costs low to support the recovery.  Futures show the likelihood that policy makers will
increase the target rate for overnight lending between banks by
March 2012 dropped to 22 percent, from 35 percent odds a month
ago. The central bank has held its benchmark in a range from
zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The Fed plans to  purchase  $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of
debt due from December 2012 to November 2013 today under the
$600 billion debt purchase program expiring this month.  Fisher said yesterday in Dallas he won’t support a third
round of quantitative easing, saying “we’ve done enough” to
support the  U.S. economy .  Record monetary stimulus is still needed to boost a
“frustratingly slow” recovery, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said last week. He is due to speak in  Washington  on fiscal
sustainability today.  Treasuries have returned 3.1 percent this quarter, the most
since the second quarter of last year, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
