Corn fell to a one-month low and
soybeans declined on bets that favorable weather will boost
yields in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter.  About 69 percent of the corn crop was in good or excellent
condition on June 12, up from 67 percent a week earlier, the
U.S.  Department of Agriculture  said yesterday. An estimated 87
percent of soybeans were planted, compared with the average of
89 percent in the previous five years.  “The markets are focused on rapid planting progress and
improving crop conditions,” said Nate Smith, a broker at the
Linn Group in  Chicago . Warmer weather and some rain is forecast
for next week, “and that will maintain favorable growing
conditions,” he said.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 19.5 cents, or 2.8
percent, to close at $6.85 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $6.7475, the lowest
for the most-active contract since May 12.  On June 9, December futures reached $7.2275, an all-time
high for the contract. On June 10, the price for July delivery,
the most-active by open interest at the time, rose to a record
$7.9975.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 13 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $13.6375 a bushel, the contract’s fourth straight
decline. The USDA said last week that reserves before the next
harvest will rise as export demand ebbs.  China ’s central bank ordered lenders to set aside more cash
in reserves as inflation accelerated to the fastest pace since
July 2008. The country is the leading importer of soybeans, and
it’s the biggest consumer of corn behind the U.S.  “Rising inflation in China may lead to interest-rate hikes
and reduce speculative buying interest,” Smith said. “The
markets are watching for clues about money flows from
investors.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
