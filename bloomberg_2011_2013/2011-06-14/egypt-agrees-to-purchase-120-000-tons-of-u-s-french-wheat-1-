Egypt , the world’s biggest wheat
importer, agreed to buy 120,000 metric tons of the grain grown
in the U.S. and  France .  The  General Authority  for Supply Commodities bought 60,000
tons of soft red winter wheat at $306 a ton from Cargill Inc.,
Vice Chairman Nomani Nomani said today in Cairo. It also
purchased an equal amount of French milling wheat at $327.30 a
ton from Granite, he said. All of the grain is for shipment
between July 11-20.  The transaction is the first wheat purchase since Feb. 23
by the authority. It purchases between 5 million and 6 million
tons of the grain a year on behalf of the government through
international tenders because local production is insufficient
to meet demand in the Arab world’s most populous nation, which
has about 80 million people. The wheat is used in a subsidized
bread program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
