Southern Cross  Healthcare Plc’s 80
landlords have agreed to “significant” rent cuts, the
Financial Times reported, citing Daniel Smith, chairman of a
committee composed of eight of the company’s biggest landlords.  The long-term cuts may average 10 percent to 15 percent,
the FT said, citing an unidentified person close to the
situation. The proposals will be presented to Southern Cross,
the government and the care home operator’s lenders on June 15,
the FT said. A Southern Cross spokesman contacted outside office
hours declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
