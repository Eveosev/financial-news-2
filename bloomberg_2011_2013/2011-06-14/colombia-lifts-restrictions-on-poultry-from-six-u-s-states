Colombia  lifted restrictions on
shipments of poultry and related products from six U.S. states,
the Department of Agriculture said.  The  report  posted today on the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural
Service’s website did not give a reason for the restrictions in
Arkansas,  Idaho , Oregon, Kentucky, Minnesota and Virginia.  Colombia imported 32,378 metric tons of U.S. poultry and
poultry products in 2010. That’s less than 1 percent of the 3.8
million tons of total U.S. exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
