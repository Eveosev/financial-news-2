The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars strengthened after data showed  China ’s industrial
production grew by more than economists had estimated, boosting
prospects for growth in exports from the South Pacific nations.  The Aussie extended its advance, rising versus all of its
16 most-traded counterparts, after U.S. retail sales fell less
than forecast. The New Zealand dollar also advanced as stock
gains boosted demand for the currencies of commodity exporters.  “China’s demand or internally driven growth is still
pretty strong; that’s positive for risk currencies,” said
 Jonathan Cavenagh , a foreign-exchange strategist in  Singapore  at
Westpac Banking Corp., Australia’s second-largest lender.  The Australian dollar appreciated 0.9 percent to $1.0693 at
12:06 p.m. in  New York , from $1.0602 yesterday, when it reached
$1.0521, the lowest since May 26. The currency climbed 1.2
percent to 86.09 yen, from 85.07, and touched 86.16 yen, the
highest level in a week.  New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.4 percent to 81.86 U.S.
cents, from 81.55 cents yesterday. It strengthened 0.7 percent
to 65.90 yen, from 65.44 yen.  China’s industrial production increased 13.3 percent in May
from a year earlier, the Beijing-based National Bureau of
Statistics reported today, exceeding the 13.1 percent growth
predicted by economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Consumer prices in China rose 5.5 percent in May from a
year earlier. The gain matched the median of economists’
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey, easing concern the
government of the fastest-growing major economy would take
measures to cool its expansion.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of stocks climbed 1.3 percent after
U.S. Commerce Department data showed American retail sales fell
0.2 percent in May, less than the 0.5 percent drop forecast by
economists in another Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
