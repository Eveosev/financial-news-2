     June 14 (Bloomberg) --Orlando Ayala, a senior vice
president at  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s biggest software
maker, says the personal computer will remain relevant even with
the growth in sales of tablet devices and mobile phones.  Ayala spoke with Bloomberg Television’sLiza Tan in Jakarta
yesterday.  “More smartphones are going to come and continue to grow
very fast. Tablets are going to grow too, but remember that this
is sometimes too focused on the device and people should be
focusing on the scenario.  ‘‘Tablets are good for consuming content, not for producing
content. PCs are actually good for mostly producing content. So,
you don’t see a person producing a large spreadsheet in a phone
or in a tablet, you see them doing that in a PC. So I think
there is space for all of them.  ‘‘The fact that Windows 7 already has 350 million users in
less than a year of release speaks to the fact that the PC will
continue to be very relevant, even though tablets and phones
will continue to grow. So I think all of them are going to have
a good future.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
