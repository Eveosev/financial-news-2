Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  said constraints on plant
availability in the fourth quarter will “make it difficult”
for the company to meet its full-year production target of 7.2
million metric tons.  “We therefore believe that, at this stage, 7.1 million
tons is a more realistic target.” the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
