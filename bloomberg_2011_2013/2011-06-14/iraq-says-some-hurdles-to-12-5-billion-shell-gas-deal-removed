Iraq  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
removed some hurdles blocking a $12.5 billion natural-gas
contract, Deputy Oil Minister Ahmad al-Shamaa said.  “There were some points of differences, and we have
managed to narrow them and the exchanges between us are
continuing,” he said today in a telephone interview from
 Baghdad . “There is nothing expected this week, we will see for
later on.”  The project with Shell and Mitsubishi Corp. involves
developing and capturing gas that is being flared, or burned
off, in southern Iraq. The signing of the agreement has been
repeatedly delayed since last year.  The Iraqi government is eager to develop gas resources to
supply fuel to generate electricity. The nation’s power plants
have failed to meet domestic demand and ending blackouts has
become a top political priority. The government, which hopes
eventually to produce enough gas to export, awarded three
licenses last November in the nation’s first auction of
concessions for the fuel since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
