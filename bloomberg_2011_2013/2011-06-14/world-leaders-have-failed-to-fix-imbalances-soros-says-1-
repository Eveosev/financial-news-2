World leaders have failed to address
underlying imbalances in the global economy, imperiling a
recovery, billionaire investor  George Soros  said.  “We aren’t out of the woods at all,” he said today at a
conference in Oslo. “The markets did in fact collapse.”  Leaders have kept markets up with “artificial life
support” without dealing with the imbalances, he said. Soros,
80, said that a withdrawal of stimulus in the U.S. has come too
early, and that  Europe  faces a “two-speed” recovery, while
 China  risks a “hard landing.”  High U.S. unemployment, increasing oil and food prices,
rising interest rates in Asia and trade disruption from  Japan ’s
record earthquake threaten to damp the world economy. The MSCI
World index of global stocks fell 2.4 percent last month.  Soros is chairman of Soros Fund Management LLC, which has
about $28 billion in assets. He is best known for reportedly
making $1 billion in 1992 on a successful bet that the U.K.
would fail to keep the pound in a European exchange-rate system
that pre-dated the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
