Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s fourth-biggest airline, advanced the most in almost a
month on expectations the company will this week announce an
increase in full-year profit.  The stock advanced 0.9 rupees, or 4.7 percent, 20.2 rupees,
by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis. The gain was the biggest
increase since May 16, according to Bloomberg data.  “It’s speculation on anticipation of results to be
published by June 16,” Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at Axys
Stockbroking Ltd., said in a phone interview from the city.
“There are no more hedging losses. Results would be better.”  Air Mauritius announced on Feb. 10 that its third-quarter
profits through December rose to 12.5 million euros ($18
million) from 3.22 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
