Hungary’s government plans to cap
the payment of  unemployment benefits  at 180 days, twice the
period proposed in April, according to draft legislation posted
on parliament’s  website  by the Interior Ministry on June 10.  Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said on April 13 that the
Cabinet wanted to limit the payment of unemployment benefits at
90 days as it seeks to boost the level of employment, one of the
lowest in the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
