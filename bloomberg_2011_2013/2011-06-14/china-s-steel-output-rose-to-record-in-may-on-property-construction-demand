China  steel production rose to the
highest on record last month, boosted by construction demand.  Crude-steel production from the world’s biggest steel
producer rose 7.8 percent to 60.25 million metric tons in May
from a year earlier, according to data released today by the
Beijing-based National Bureau Statistics.  Construction of new properties in China, the world’s
second-largest economy, climbed 24 percent in the first five
months, even as the government tried to slow the economy. China
wants to cool the real-estate market and rein in bank lending to
counter inflation.  “China’s tightening measures have had little impact on
builders,” said Henry Liu, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Mirae
Assets Securities Ltd. “Construction at China’s second and
third-tier cities remain active.”  Chinese prices of reinforcing bars, used to build homes,
bridges and roads, have climbed for four straight weeks to 5,036
yuan ($777) a ton as of yesterday, according to researcher
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. Prices of hot-rolled
coil, a benchmark flat product, fell 0.5 percent in the same
period to 4,850 yuan.  Smaller steelmakers in China are likely to benefit from the
stronger prices for construction steel, while bigger mills are
suffering because they make flat products used by automakers and
appliances, Liu said.  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., China’s biggest publicly traded
steelmaker, cut product prices by between 100 yuan and 200 yuan
a ton for July delivery on June 9 because of slowing demand from
automakers and appliances companies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
