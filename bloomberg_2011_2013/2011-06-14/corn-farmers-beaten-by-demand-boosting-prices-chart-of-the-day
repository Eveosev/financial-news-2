Corn demand is accelerating beyond
farmers’ ability to boost yields, depleting stocks and adding to
price gains as consumption in  China  and ethanol factories grows.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows gains in farm productivity have
trailed demand that expanded more than fourfold since 1961,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Consumption
accelerated in the past decade on Chinese demand for feed and
corn starch and increased use in the U.S. for ethanol output.  Corn futures climbed 86 percent in the past 12 months, more
than any other grain traded in  Chicago , after dry weather
limited the 2010 U.S. crop and as flooding in the past two
months delayed planting, threatening prospects for this year.
July delivery corn rose to a record $7.9975 last week.  “It’s a huge problem,”  Abdolreza Abbassian , a senior
economist at the  United Nations ’ Food and Agriculture
Organization, said from  Rome . “This is primarily U.S. ethanol
and starch in China, and then you have the feed where you have
stronger growth, again in China, but across the world.”  Global corn consumption is estimated at 847 million metric
tons in 2010-11, boosted by increased use for ethanol, USDA data
show. That would be the 15th consecutive year of rising use.  Corn is processed into starches used for food and glues,
and China now consumes more corn for starch production than the
U.S., according to Abbassian. Rising meat consumption is
boosting demand for corn as feed, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
