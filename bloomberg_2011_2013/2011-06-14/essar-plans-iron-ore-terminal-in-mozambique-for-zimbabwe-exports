Essar Global will build a terminal
in  Mozambique ’s port city of Beira to handle up to 20 million
metric tons of  iron ore  exports a year from Zimbabwe, London-
based Securities Africa said.  The Indian company will also build a slurry pipeline to
transport slurry from its Manisi and Ripple Creek mines to the
port, the London-based brokerage said in an e-mail today, citing
Essar’s Africa Director Firdhose Coovadia.  Essar’s plans to export iron ore slurry may conflict with
government policy in Zimbabwe, where authorities are encouraging
miners to add value to minerals before exporting them,
Securities Africa said. Essar did not say how much it would
spend building the terminal and pipeline, and Coovadia said that
“some of the plans we have are firm, but others are non-firm,”
according to Securities Africa.  Essar Group, through its Essar Africa Holdings Ltd. Unit,
took control of 54 percent of the  Zimbabwe  Iron and Steel Corp.
March 9 in a deal worth about $750 million, according to
Zimbabwe’s industry minister Welshman Ncube. Zisco also owns the
Buchwa iron ore mine in Zimbabwe.  Essar’s slurry pipeline from Zimbabwe to Beira could become
the world’s biggest, surpassing a 396-kilometer-long pipeline
carrying ore from Essar’s Germano mine to the Hazira steel plant
in  Brazil , Securities Africa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
