New Zealand ’s grape harvest rose 23
percent in 2011, buoyed by surging production in Marlborough,
the biggest producing region, and increased wine demand,
according to an industry body.  The national crop totaled 324,591 metric tons,  New Zealand
Winegrowers  said in an e-mailed statement today. That compares
with 263,445 tons in 2010, it said. Winegrowers said in February
a harvest of 300,000 tons was possible.  The industry body last year  advised  growers to limit the
2011 vintage to 265,000 tons after the global recession cut wine
demand and bumper harvests in 2008 and 2009 boosted output,
producing a glut. Sales of New Zealand wines surged 11 percent
in the past year to the equivalent of 310,000 tons of grapes,
supporting this year’s larger crop, according to the statement.  “A larger harvest was needed in 2011 to rebuild inventory
and to support current and future sales,” Chief Executive
Officer Philip Gregan said in the statement. “The vintage
should support sales growth of up to 7 percent” for the
year ending June 2012, boosting a recovery, he said.  Output in Marlborough, on New Zealand’s  South Island ,
surged 34 percent to 244,893 tons, Winegrowers said. The region
produces sauvignon blanc grapes, which accounted for 69 percent
of output this year, according to the statement.  New Zealand’s wine exports may increase 13 percent to 160
million liters in the year ending June 30, the  Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry  said in a report today.  Export revenues are likely to rise 6.1 percent to NZ$1.1
billion ($900 million) in the year to June 30, while the average
value may fall 5.5 percent to NZ$6.90 per liter as sales of bulk
wine increase, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter for this story:
