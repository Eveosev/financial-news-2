Roger Lee, a managing director at 
Battery Ventures, explains how initial public offerings are 
fueling venture capital investments in Silicon Valley.  Venture capitalists raised $12.5 billion last year, the 
lowest since 2003. This year, they are poised for a comeback, 
with the public offerings of technology startups like Groupon 
Inc. and Zynga Inc. expected to rack up investor returns in the 
billions of dollars.  (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 05:22
