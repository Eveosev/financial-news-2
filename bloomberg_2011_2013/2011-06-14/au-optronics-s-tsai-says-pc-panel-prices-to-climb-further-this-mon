AU Optronics Corp. (2409)  expects prices of
display panels used in computers to climb further this month,
driven by demand for commercial laptops, Michael Tsai, general
manager of IT products said today.  Prices of PC panels have already climbed 5 percent to 6
percent this quarter from the first quarter, and will meet the
company’s guidance for a “high single digit” percentage rise,
Tsai said. Demand for touch-panels used in tablet devices is
strong and supply remains in shortage, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
