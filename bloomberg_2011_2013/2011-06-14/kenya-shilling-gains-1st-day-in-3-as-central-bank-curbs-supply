Kenya ’s shilling strengthened the
first day in three against the dollar as the central bank sold
repurchase agreements to curb  money supply .  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.6 percent to 89.38 per dollar and was trading 0.5
percent stronger at 89.45 by 2:14 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi,
from yesterday’s close of 89.88.  Kenya’s central bank sold 500 million shillings ($6
million) of repurchase agreements at 5.75 percent today, an
official who declined to be identified in line with the Nairobi-
based bank’s policy said today.  “The correction of the local unit is due to the mop-up by
the central bank,” Mwambu Malamba, a senior dealer at Nairobi-
based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview
today.  The shilling has weakened 9.8 percent against the dollar
this year, making it the fourth-worst performer worldwide after
Suriname’s dollar, Maldives’ rufiyaa and the Iranian rial,
according to Bloomberg data. The currency reached the weakest
level in 17 years against the dollar yesterday.  In a repurchase agreement an investor agrees to sell a
security to another trader, while at the same time arranging to
buy it back at a future date and at a pre-determined price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
