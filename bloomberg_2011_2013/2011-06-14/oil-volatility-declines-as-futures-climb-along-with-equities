Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures increased for the first time in three days on
a rally by equities and a U.S. retail sales decline that was
less than expected.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.3 percent as of 5 p.m. in  New
York , down from 31.7 percent yesterday.  Crude for July delivery gained $2.07, or 2.1 percent, to
settle at $99.37 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in
the biggest one-day increase since May 18. Prices have climbed
32 percent in the past year. August futures gained $2.02, or 2.1
percent, to $99.86 a barrel.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
July $95 puts, with 3,460 lots changing hands. They dropped 43
cents to 15 cents a barrel. July $98 puts, the next-most active
option, tumbled $1.18 to 53 cents a barrel with 3,172 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  July options expire on June 16.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  July $96 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 9,979 lots changing hands. They gained 33
cents to 84 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, July
$100 calls, dropped 75 cents to 39 cents a barrel on volume of
9,421 lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
46,227 contracts. Next were December 2011 $120 calls with 41,011
and December 2011 $150 calls with 38,362.  To contact the reporter on this story:
