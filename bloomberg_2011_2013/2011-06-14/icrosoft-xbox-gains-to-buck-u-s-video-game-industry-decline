Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s  Xbox 360  was the
top-selling video-game console in the U.S. last month, bucking a
software-led decline that saw industry sales slump to their
lowest since October 2006.  Xbox 360 sales increased 39 percent to 270,000 units from a
year earlier, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said yesterday
in an e-mailed statement, citing industry tracker NPD Group Inc.
 Sony Corp. (6758) , maker of the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable,
said its hardware sales rose 14 percent.  Microsoft sold more Xbox 360 consoles than any other
platform 11 of the past 12 months in the U.S, according to NPD
data. Xbox 360 is likely to be number one worldwide by the end
of this year with the biggest blockbuster games, Kinect games
and experiences, NPD said.  Industrywide, a light slate of new game software and
Nintendo Co.’s aging Wii console contributed to a 14 percent
decline in overall retail sales to $743.1 million in May,  Port
Washington , New York-based NPD said in an e-mailed statement.
The figure doesn’t include digital sales of games.  “Overall, the Xbox 360 platform has contributed 34 percent
of year-to-date revenues” across hardware, content and
accessories, said  Anita Frazier , an analyst with NPD. The
platform has gained 7 percentage points of market share, she
said.  Industry hardware sales dropped 5 percent to $228.9
million, and software declined 19 percent to $375.8 million, NPD
reported.  Sony’s PS3 and PSP both showed unit-sales growth, NPD
reported, without citing exact figures.  Sony, based in  Tokyo , suffered an almost monthlong outage
to its PlayStation Network and Qriocity online services
following a hacker attack in April. More than 100 million
accounts were illegally accessed, resulting in the second-
largest data breach in U.S. history.  Sales of Nintendo’s 3DS handheld, which lets users play 3-D
games without the need for special glasses, remained light,
Frazier said. Games featuring Nintendo characters such as Zelda
should help increase sales of the hardware in coming months, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
