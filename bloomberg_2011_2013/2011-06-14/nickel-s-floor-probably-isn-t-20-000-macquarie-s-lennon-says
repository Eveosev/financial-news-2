Nickel’s price floor probably isn’t
$20,000 a metric ton because nickel pig iron producers in China
are lowering their costs,  Jim Lennon , global head of commodities
research at Macquarie Bank Group Ltd. said. The following
comments were from a phone interview on June 6.  On prices:  “The idea that $20,000 is some sort of floor on the price
through which it cannot penetrate, I think it’s not correct.
Sixty percent of the cost of producing nickel pig iron is
the nickel ore itself. As the nickel price comes down, the price
of the ore comes down as well. At today’s nickel prices, the
breakeven may be $20,000. But if the nickel price goes to
$20,000, then the breakeven for these facilities comes down to
$18,000 to $19,000.”  On nickel pig iron production in  China :  “Older furnaces that started up using low grade ores and
offered coke are gradually being replaced by brand new
ferronickel operations using electric arc furnaces, importing
high-grade ores from the  Philippines  and  Indonesia . The energy
consumption is 30 to 50 percent lower than the older plants so
the cash costs of production are coming down dramatically. Many
of these newer plants will have a breakeven operating cost of
about $15,000 per ton. The older plants that have been around
for the last four or five years, their breakeven is more in the
region of $20,000 to $22,000 a ton.”  On nickel pig iron production in 2011:  “We hear that there are over 200,000 tons of new furnaces
coming on-stream over the next 12 months. In theory, the
production could be as high as 300,000 tons. We’re still using
conservatively 220,000 for the whole of this year.”  On global nickel supply:  “Half of the growth is coming from Chinese nickel pig-iron
production.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
