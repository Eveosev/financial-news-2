Poland may report a  budget surplus 
this month because it will receive 6.2 billion zloty ($2.28
billion) from the central bank’s 2010 net income, more than
triple the amount anticipated.  The government expects to receive the funds within two
weeks after approving the  Narodowy Bank Polski ’s annual report
today, the Cabinet said in an e-mailed statement. The bank
posted a 6.5 billion-zloty profit last year and must transfer 95
percent of it to the government.  “The June budget surplus may reach 5 billion zloty thanks
to the profit transfer from the central bank,”  Marcin Mrowiec ,
chief economist at Bank Pekao SA in Warsaw, said in an e-mailed
comment yesterday. “As a result, the first-half budget deficit
would account for 47 percent of the annual plan.”  Poland has pledged to cut its  budget deficit  to less than
the European Union limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product
next year from 7.9 percent in 2010. The government estimates
this year’s shortfall at 40.2 billion zloty. The gap was 23.9
billion zloty at the end of May, less than the 29.6 billion-
zloty plan for the first five months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
