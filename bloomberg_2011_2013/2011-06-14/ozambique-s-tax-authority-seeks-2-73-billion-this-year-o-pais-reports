Mozambique’s state run tax authority
is targeting 79 billion meticais in taxes this year, an increase
from the 63 billion Meticais collected in 2010, the daily
independent O Pais reported on its website today, citing
authority Chairman Rosario Fernandes.  The tax authority’s target was aimed at covering the
southern African country’s 2011 national budget deficit of 62
billion Meticais, the Maputo-based daily cited Fernandes saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
