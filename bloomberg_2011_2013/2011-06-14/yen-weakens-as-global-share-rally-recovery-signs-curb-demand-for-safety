The euro dropped the most in more
than a month against the dollar after the Greek prime minister’s
government lost political support as the European Union
struggled to break a deadlock on a second financial rescue for
the nation.  Europe ’s shared currency fell versus most of its major
counterparts, except for  Sweden ’s krona and Norway’s krone,
which dropped as commodity prices slumped. Demand for assets
linked to growth also eased after reports showed slowing
manufacturing in the U.S. Sterling fell versus the dollar after
a report showed Britain’s jobless claims rose in May more than
economists forecast.  “The Greek issue doesn’t look like it’s going to go away
any time soon,” said  Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at
Barclays Plc in New York. “We see more downside risk for the
euro area on the macro front, and for the euro as well.”  The euro fell 1.7 percent to $1.4201 at 12:40 p.m. in  New
York , from $1.4440 yesterday, after touching $1.4181, the lowest
level since May 27. The currency slid 1.2 percent to 114.80 yen,
from 116.23. The dollar gained 0.5 percent to 80.86 yen, from
80.49, after touching 81.06, the highest level since June 2.  Europe’s common currency has depreciated 1.2 percent in the
past week against nine other developed-nation currencies,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.
The dollar has risen 1.6 percent.  Greek Developments  The euro fell today by the most since May 5.  “Some resolution is necessary and the longer  Greece  kind
of wavers in this grey area the more toxic for the euro,” said
 Jessica Hoversen , a New York-based analyst at futures broker MF
Global Holdings Ltd. “Euro weakness will be broad based.”  The euro may fall below $1.40 for the first time in three
weeks, according to Citigroup Inc., citing technical indicators.  The failure of the euro to break above $1.4711, the 76.4
percent Fibonacci retracement level from the May 4 high of
$1.4940, has seen the euro weaken 3.3 percent against the
dollar. Today’s break below the 55-day moving average of $1.4409
may see the euro weaken to $1.3970, said  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief
technical analyst at Citigroup in New York.  “The inability to break the 76.4 percent retracement level
signaled a danger to push lower,” Fitzpatrick said in an
interview. “The euro is trading heavily, so our sense is we can
go and retest the $1.3968 level and if that breaks there is a
danger we see that move accelerate.”  Seeking Unity  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s, who was trying to
form a national unity government with the country’s biggest
opposition party, was told to resign by the opposition.  Papandreou, struggling to push through austerity measures
demanded by international lenders, was told to step aside and
let the president name a so-called technical government to
renegotiate the terms of the nation’s rescue package, said an
official in the opposition New Democracy Party.  Police fired tear gas at 20,000 people that encircled the
Parliament House today to protest Papandreou’s additional wage
cuts and tax increases. The nation’s two biggest unions were on
strike.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  will meet on June 17 in Berlin, with pressure
mounting for the leaders to resolve their differences over a
rescue for Greece.  Standard & Poor’s  lowered Greece’s credit
rating on June 13 to the lowest among nations.  EU Meets  EU finance ministers agreed yesterday to convene again on
June 19 after they failed to reconcile a German-led push for
bondholders to share part of the cost of a new plan for Greek
aid. European Central Bank warnings were backed by  France  that
the move might constitute the region’s first sovereign default.  Sterling weakened as the  Office for National Statistics 
reported that the U.K.’s jobless claims rose by 19,600 in May
after a revised 16,900 increase in the prior month. The median
forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an
increase of 6,500. The pound lost 0.7 percent to $1.6256.  U.K. consumer confidence jumped the most in 5 1/2 years in
May, figures from the Nationwide Building Society show.
Nationwide’s index of sentiment gained 11 points to 55, the
highest in five months. The pound touched 87.74 pence per euro,
the strongest since June 2.  Stocks, Commodities  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.5 percent and the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of commodities fell 1.4
percent.  Canada ’s dollar declined 1.3 percent to 98.09 cents per
 U.S. dollar .  Norway ’s krone dropped 0.6 percent to 7.8561 per euro and
the Swedish krona lost 0.4 percent to 9.1917 per euro.  The consumer-price index increased 0.2 percent, compared
with the 0.1 percent median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, figures from the Labor Department showed today
in  Washington . The core measure, which excludes more volatile
food and energy costs, climbed 0.3 percent, the biggest increase
since July 2008.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index dropped to minus 7.8, the lowest level since November,
from 11.9 in May. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists was 12. Industrial production in the U.S. rose 0.1
percent in May after no change the prior month, figures from the
Fed showed today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
