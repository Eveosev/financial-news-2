U.S. gasoline demand at the pump
rose 0.2 percent last week as prices fell for the fifth
consecutive week, according to a  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  SpendingPulse
report.  Motorists bought an average 9.3 million barrels a day in
the week ended June 10, up from 9.19 million the previous week,
the second-biggest payments network company said.  Averaged over four weeks, gasoline use was 1 percent below
the same period in 2010, John Gamel, director of economic
analysis for SpendingPulse, said in a report. It was the 12th
consecutive decline in the average.  The average pump price dropped 4 cents to $3.75 a gallon.
Prices are 39 percent above a year earlier.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the companyâ€™s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
