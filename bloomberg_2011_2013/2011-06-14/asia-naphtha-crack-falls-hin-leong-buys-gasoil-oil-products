Asia naphtha’s crack spread dropped,
signaling eroding profit for refiners. Hin Leong Trading Pte
bought a discounted gasoil cargo in Singapore, the region’s
biggest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent sank to
$60.67 a metric ton today from $74.59 at the end of Asian
trading yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
narrowing crack spread indicates refining margins from making
the petrochemical feedstock are declining.  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  dropped
$8.50, or 0.9 percent, to $960 a ton, Bloomberg data showed.
Prices are at the lowest in four trading days.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline fell $1.75, or 1.4 percent, to
$119.90 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data. Prices are at the
lowest in a week. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha shrank 75 cents
today to $15.25. The narrower reforming margin indicates it is
less profitable to turn naphtha into gasoline.  BP Plc sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for first-half August
delivery to Glencore International AG at $959 a ton, traders
said. Trafigura Beheer BV bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON
gasoline for loading June 29 to July 3 from the European
explorer at $119.95 a barrel. Trafigura sold 50,000 barrels of
97-RON for loading July 6 to July 10 to Vitol Group at $124 a
barrel.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur rose 5 cents to
$131 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Jet fuel climbed 50
cents to $132.15.  In  Singapore , Hin Leong bought 150,000 barrels of 0.5
percent sulfur gasoil from Barclays Plc at 50 cents a barrel
below benchmark quotes, traders said. That’s the same discount
the Singapore trader received June 10 in the most recent
transaction. Hin Leong sold 250,000 barrels with 0.25 percent
sulfur to PetroChina Co. at a 30-cent premium, the first time
this grade changed hands since May 6, according to Bloomberg
tracking of deals.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude increased
54 cents to $21.45 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based on
data from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, was at the widest since April 15.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 5 cents to 95 cents a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade widened for a fourth day,
indicating it’s more profitable to produce  aviation fuel .  Fuel Oil   Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil fell $8.50, or 1.3
percent, to $673.25 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The
price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel,
declined $9.50, or 1.4 percent, to $660. Each variety dropped
the most since May 23.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened $1.66 to $6.73 a
barrel, based on Bloomberg data. That’s the largest difference
so far this month, indicating widening losses for turning oil
into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was up $1 at $13.25 a ton, Bloomberg data showed. This
viscosity spread is at the widest in three weeks.  Refinery News  Titan Chemicals Corp., a unit of Honam Petrochemical Corp.,
will shut one of two naphtha crackers at Pasir Gudang in
 Malaysia  from June 26 for 30 days of maintenance, a company
official said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
