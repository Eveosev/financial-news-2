Bulgarian inflation quickened in May
after slowing the previous month as fuel and food prices in the
European Union’s poorest country rose.  The annual rate was 4.8 percent, compared with 4.6 percent
in April, the National Statistics Institute in Sofia said today
in a statement on its website. The median estimate of four
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a rate of 5.1 percent.
Prices were unchanged compared with April.  Central banks around the world are fighting inflation
spurred by higher food and fuel costs. Rising global commodity
prices have also been a factor as the country recovers from a
recession.  Bulgaria ’s economy expanded 3.4 percent in the first
quarter, driven by exports.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its inflation forecasts
for Bulgaria on May 20 to an average 4.2 percent this year and 3
percent in 2012, from 4.8 percent and 3.7 percent respectively.
The government forecasts annual inflation at 3.6 percent this
year, after overshooting last year’s target of 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
