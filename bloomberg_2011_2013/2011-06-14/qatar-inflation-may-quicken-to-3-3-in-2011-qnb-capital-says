Qatar’s inflation rate may reach 3.3
percent this year, after two straight years of falling prices,
as housing costs appreciate,  QNB Capital  said today.  “There are signs that rents are stabilizing after they
witnessed steep corrections in recent years,” QNB Capital, the
finance arm of  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , said in a report.  Prices for housing, as measured by the country’s consumer
price index, will rise 0.4 percent in 2011 and 1.4 percent in
2012, the bank said. Housing prices fell 5.2 percent in the
first four months of this year, down from a 14 percent decline
in the same period a year earlier.  “Given the continued strong economic growth in Qatar
coupled with a moderate  population growth , and redevelopment of
certain areas in Doha, housing and commercial property demand is
expected to match up with existing and upcoming supply,” the
report said.  Qatar’s consumer price index has risen each month since
November after declining for the first 10 months of last year.  The Persian Gulf emirate, holder of the world’s third-
largest gas reserves, is forecast by the  International Monetary
Fund  to have the world’s fastest growing economy for the second
straight year in 2011 as it increases petroleum exports.  To contact the reporters on this story:
