Venkatraman Anantha-Nageswaran, the
Singapore-based global chief investment officer at Bank Julius
Baer & Co., which has about $304 billion of client assets,
comments on the outlook for policy tightening in  China  after
data today showed inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in
almost three years in May.  Asian stocks rose, with China’s Shanghai Composite Index
climbing 1.2 percent as of 2:28 p.m. local time. The 5.5 percent
annual gain in consumer prices matched the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. Separate reports today also
showed industrial production rose more than estimates and fixed-
asset investment quickened.  On China’s:  “There are some structural elements to China’s inflation.
It’s also mainly due to the lag of the last two to three years
of massive credit growth, so there is definitely more to be done
by the People’s Bank of China. Basically they need to raise
 interest rates  by 50 to 75 basis points.  “Administrative controls on credit growth simply drive
credit to the shadow of the banking system. It doesn’t really
reduce the flow of credit, it simply makes it disappear from the
eyes of the regulators. They don’t end up actually achieving the
full purpose so there’s a need for greater reliance on the
mechanisms like interest rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
