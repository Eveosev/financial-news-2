     June 14 (Bloomberg.com) -- I’m fond of tracking which ETFs
close, mostly in the same way I might track rising and falling
pop songs. It tells you what the cool kids are up to, or at least
what people think they should be up to.  With that in mind, I was struck by some religious entries on
tonight’s list. Here are the some religious ETFs that are
closing:  * FaithShares Baptist Values Fund (FZB)
  * FaithShares Catholic Values Fund (FCV)
  * FaithShares Lutheran Values Fund (FKL)
  * FaithShares Methodist Values Fund (FMV)  The only one of the FaithShares set that is staying open?
FaithShares Christian Values Fund (FOC). Apparently there is only
religio-alpha in ecumenical funds. Let that be a lesson to all
you religious sorts.  [via IndexUniverse]  Click here  to see the story as it appeared on Bloomberg.com.
