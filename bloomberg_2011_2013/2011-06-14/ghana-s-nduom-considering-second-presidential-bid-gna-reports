Paa Kwesi Nduom, who lost  Ghana ’s
2008 presidential election as the  Convention People’s Party ’s
candidate, started a group to study if he should make another
bid next year, the Ghana News Agency said today, citing Nduom.  The exploratory committee will examine whether Nduom is the
best candidate for the CPP to challenge the two biggest
political parties, the ruling National Democratic Congress and
the opposition New Patriotic Party, the state-owned agency
reported, citing Nii Armah Nkunim, the group’s spokesman.  The group will finish its work before the September CPP
party congress that will choose its candidate for the December
2012 election, the Accra-based agency cited Nkunim as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
