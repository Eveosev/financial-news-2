European Central Bank Governing
Council member Mario Draghi said he “knew nothing” about
 Greece  using off-market swaps with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “I had nothing to do with this deal whatsoever,” Draghi
told lawmakers in Brussels at his confirmation hearing for the
ECB Presidency today. “The deals between the Greek government
and Goldman Sachs had been undertaken before my joining of
Goldman Sachs.”  Greece hid 5.3 billion euros ($7.7 billion) of debt using
currency swaps, the biggest of which were with Goldman Sachs,
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics office, said Nov. 15.
Greece entered into a number of arrangements from 2001 through
2007 and their use, which it hadn’t previously reported as debt,
helped push up borrowings, leading to the nation needing a
bailout last year and triggering  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Draghi, who worked at Goldman Sachs as a vice chairman from
2002 to 2005, said that “even though Goldman Sachs expected me
to work with the public sector, I had no interest and taste to
work with the public sector,” adding that “I knew nothing
about these things, nor had I done anything later on about these
things, you can ask anybody.”  Draghi, 63, is the only candidate to take over from ECB
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  when he steps down in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
