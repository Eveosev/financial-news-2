General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s
biggest maker of electricity-generation equipment, will supply
40 wind turbines to Stena Renewable AB for four new power
stations in southern  Sweden  that will supply 50,000 homes.  Stena Renewable, based in Goeteborg, signed a contract for
the machines made by the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company
each with a capacity of 2.5 megawatts, according to a statement
today from GE. The company declined to disclose terms when
contacted by telephone.  The four projects in the municipalities of Laholm, Boxholm
and Mjoelby, represent investment of about 1.2 billion Swedish
kronor ($190 million) and will be put into service this year and
through mid-2012, according to the statement.  The projects are part of GE’s strategy to supply turbines
in central and eastern European countries that are seeking to
meet their renewable energy and emissions-cutting goals, the
company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
