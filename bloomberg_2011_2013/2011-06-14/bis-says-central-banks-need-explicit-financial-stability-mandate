Central banks need clear financial-
stability mandates to reduce the risk of “boundary disputes”
and a mismatch between expectations and their capabilities,
according to a Bank for International Settlements study.  “Most central bank laws currently do not give the central
bank an explicit and comprehensive mandate for financial-
stability policy or specify a macro-prudential function for the
central bank,” the Basel, Switzerland-based organization said
in a  report  released today. “There is a strong case for making
the financial-stability mandate explicit and clear.”  Authorities are redesigning the global financial system to
prevent future crises after risky lending and a narrow
regulatory focus on individual institutions led to the collapse
of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  in 2008. Clarity about the
responsibilities of the bodies involved in financial-stability
policy is of “paramount importance” for effective and rapid
decision making, BIS said.  “Doing so reduces the risk of boundary disputes between
agencies and the risk of defensive responses by an agency that
fears being held to account for things it was not sure it was
required to do,” said the report, written by a group of central
bank officials led by Swedish central bank Governor Stefan
Ingves. It also “increases the chances that agencies, including
the central bank, will take the hard decisions when needed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
