Grain exports from Ukraine reached
130,000 metric tons in the first nine days of June, according to
producers’ group Ukrainian Agrarian Confederation.  The Confederation expected outbound grain shipments to
reach 1.5 million tons in June, Director Sergey Stoianov said in
a statement on the group’s website today. Grain exports reached
1.1 million tons in May.  Grain export quotas were removed by the government on June
4. They were introduced in October following a 6 million-ton
harvest loss caused by drought and to deal with inflation
concerns. A grain export duty will come into effect from July 1.  “Grain producers here are not willing to sell,” said
Nikolay Vernitsky, director of Kiev-based researcher ProAgro,
said today by phone. There has not been active contracting,
especially for barley, according to the analyst.  To contact the reporter on this story:
