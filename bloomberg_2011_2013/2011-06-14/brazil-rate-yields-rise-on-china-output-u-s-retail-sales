Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts rose after Chinese industrial output and U.S.
retail sales exceeded economists’ estimates, boosting inflation
expectations for  Latin America ’s biggest economy.  Yields on the contract due in January 2013 increased three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.47 percent at 5
p.m. New York time. The yield on the contract maturing in
January 2017 climbed four basis points to 12.18 percent. The
real was little changed at 1.5837 per dollar, from 1.5832
yesterday.  The 0.2 percent decrease in May U.S. retail sales reported
today in  Washington  was smaller than forecast. The median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a drop of
0.5 percent.  China ’s industrial output expanded 13.3 percent in
May from a year earlier, the country’s statistics bureau said,
beating the median 13.1 percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of 21 economists.  “The data moves away from fears that the world economy is
slowing further,”  Newton Rosa , chief economist at Sul America
Investimentos, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  Brazilian policy makers raised the benchmark lending rate
25 basis points last week to 12.25 percent, keeping a pledge to
raise borrowing costs for a “sufficiently long period” to
bring inflation back to their target in 2012, according to a
statement accompanying the June 8 decision. Policy makers are
scheduled to release the minutes of last week’s meeting on June
16.  Yields on the contracts are likely to move in response to
the external market until policy makers release the minutes of
the policy meeting, Rosa said.  Consumer prices rose 6.55 percent in the year through May.
The central bank aims to slow inflation back to the mid-point of
its target in 2012. The government targets inflation of 4.5
percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
