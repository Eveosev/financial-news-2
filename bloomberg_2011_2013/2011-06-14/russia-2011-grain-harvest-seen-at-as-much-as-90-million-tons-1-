Russia  may harvest as much as 90
million metric tons of grain this year if the weather is good,
Arkady Zlochevsky, the president of the country’s Grain Union,
told reporters today in Moscow.  Rains have started in central Russia, reducing drought
risks in the so-called Black Earth regions, he said.  Food inflation risks are low because there will not be any
extreme price rises in the domestic grains market, Zlochevsky
said, adding that he doesn’t think an export duty will be
necessary in the next marketing season.  Fourth-grade milling wheat, a popular export, is about
5,800 rubles ($208) a ton in North Caucasus, he said. The new
grain harvest, which is expected in July, will lower domestic
prices and reduce the risks of food inflation, he said.  Grain Union  estimates Russia will export 20 million tons
between July 1 and June 30, 2012 under a conservative scenario
with a harvest of 85 million tons, Zlochevsky said, adding
between 7 million tons and 8 million tons are expected to be
shipped in the July through September period.  Carry-over grain stocks, including the country’s own
reserves and imported grain, will reach between 16 million tons
and 17 million tons by July 1, 2012, he said. Russia consumes
about 67.4 million tons a year, and may use a maximum of 70
million tons, if livestock farms increase consumption, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
