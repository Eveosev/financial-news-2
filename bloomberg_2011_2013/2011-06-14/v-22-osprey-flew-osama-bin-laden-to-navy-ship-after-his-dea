A V-22 Osprey aircraft ferried Osama  bin Laden ’s body to the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Carl
Vinson after he was killed in a U.S. raid May 2 in Pakistan.  Representative Norman Dicks, a Democrat from Washington,
talked about the tilt-rotor aircraft’s mission as the House
Appropriations Committee was considering the 2012 Pentagon
spending bill.  “I don’t know the details,” Dicks said in an interview
after the session. “They had the V-22s” in Afghanistan “so
they used that to transport his body to the carrier.”  Bin Laden was subsequently buried at sea.  Dicks said he was told about the role of the V-22,
manufactured by  Boeing Co. (BA)  of Chicago and  Textron Inc. (TXT)  of
Providence, Rhode Island, during an unclassified briefing in
 Afghanistan .  The House committee, in its fiscal 2012 defense budget
report approved today, urged the Navy to request authority in
fiscal 2013 to proceed with another multiyear contract to
complete the entire 458-aircraft program. The Navy and the
companies are in the last year of a four-year, $10.4 billion
contract for 167 aircraft.  The House appropriations panel approved the Pentagon’s
request for $2.5 billion for 35 aircraft, including five for Air
Force special operations, in fiscal 2012, which begins Oct. 1.  Dicks said the V-22’s performance in the Bin Laden mission
as well as its overall performance overseas factored into the
committee’s action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
