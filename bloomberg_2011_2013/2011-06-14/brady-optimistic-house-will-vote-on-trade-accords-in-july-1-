U.S. Representative Kevin Brady,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee’s trade panel,
said he’s optimistic Congress will vote on three pending free-
trade agreements next month.  House Republicans  won’t agree to renew an aid program for
displaced workers at its 2009 funding level, Brady, a Texas
Republican, also said today at an event in  Washington . The Obama
administration has sought the aid extension as a condition for
sending the trade agreements to lawmakers. Brady said
differences between Republicans and Democrats on trade issues
will be resolved, allowing the trade pacts to pass.  “Since January, we’ve made more progress on the trade
front than we have in the past four years,” Brady said. “Our
priority right now has to be passing” the three agreements.  The Obama administration reworked agreements with  South
Korea , Colombia and Panama reached under President  George W. Bush . The South Korea deal would boost U.S. exports to that
nation by as much as $10.9 billion a year when in full effect,
and the accord with Colombia would increase exports by as much
as $1.1 billion, according to the U.S. International Trade
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
