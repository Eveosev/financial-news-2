Thailand ’s baht rebounded from a
three-month low on optimism  China  will avoid an economic slump,
supporting exports from  Southeast Asia ’s second-largest economy.  China reported today industrial production grew more than
economists forecast and inflation accelerated to the fastest
pace in almost three years. Asia’s largest economy is Thailand’s
biggest export market, taking 11 percent of shipments in the
first quarter of 2011, official data show. The baht touched a
three-month low yesterday as overseas investors cut holdings of
the nation’s equities ahead of elections on July 3.  “China’s data had some positive impact on sentiment, but
it seems to be more of a secondary impact,” said Parson Singha,
chief market strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Bangkok. “The
baht has still seen a weakening bias because portfolio investors
are a bit worried about the political situation.”  The baht strengthened 0.1 percent to 30.44 per dollar as of
4:33 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached 30.54 yesterday, the weakest level since
March 3. It has lost 0.4 percent this month as global funds sold
$701 million more Thai stocks than they bought.  China’s industrial production expanded 13.3 percent in May,
more than the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey for a 13.1
percent gain, government data showed. That compared with a 13.4
percent rise in April. Inflation quickened to 5.5 percent in May,
the most since July 2008, from 5.3 percent the previous month.  Asia ’s largest economy increased the amount the biggest
lenders must set aside as reserves today by half a percentage
point to 21.5 percent, effective June 20.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015 rose
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.55 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The onshore one-year
interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to receive a floating
payment, increased one basis point to 3.28 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
