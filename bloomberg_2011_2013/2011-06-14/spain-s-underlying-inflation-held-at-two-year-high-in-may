Spain’s underlying inflation rate
remained at a two-year high in May as rising commodity prices
more than offset weak consumer demand.  Core inflation , which exclude energy and fresh food, gained
2.1 percent from a year earlier, matching April’s two-year high,
the  National Statistics Institute  in  Madrid  said today. Headline
inflation, based on European Union calculations, was 3.4
percent, the same as an initial estimate on May 30.  “The rise must have filtered from commodity prices as
growth remains slow, due to weak  consumer spending ,” said
London-based European economist at Barclays Capital Fabio Fois,
citing higher iron ore and cotton prices.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled on June 9 that
the Frankfurt-based bank intends to lift its 1.25 percent
benchmark lending rate as soon as July as price pressures remain
with the euro-area inflation rate holding above the ECB’s 2
percent ceiling since December. The ECB tightened borrowing
costs in April for the first time in almost three years.  Spanish inflation has outpaced the regional average because
it has an energy-intensive economy that is dependent on
importing fuel, said Bank of  Spain  Governor Miguel Angel
Fernandez Ordonez on May 23. He said the nation’s inflation rate
will fall below the EU average next year.  The government also forecasts inflation will slow starting
in June or July, Deputy Finance Minister Jose Manuel Campa said
in April.  SPCPNEWS <Index> CN
