The Czech Cabinet may change some of
its plans for overhauling the pension system to avert a strike
that threatens to halt train and road traffic for one day this
week,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing Premier Petr Necas.  The government may link  retirement age  to  life expectancy 
after 2041, when the retirement age will reach 67 years, the
newspaper reported. Trade unions oppose the current plan to
increase the retirement age indefinitely, the newspaper said.  The strike is planned for June 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
