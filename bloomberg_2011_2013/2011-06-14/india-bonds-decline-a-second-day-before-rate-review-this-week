India ’s 10-year bonds fell, pushing
yields to the highest level in almost two weeks, on speculation
the central bank will boost borrowing costs this week.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will increase the repurchase rate
by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent on June 16, according to 15 of
17 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Two predict no change.
Wholesale-price inflation will accelerate to 8.74 percent in May
from 8.66 percent in April, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before data due around noon
local time.  “The overall conditions are still bearish for bonds as
inflation concerns continue to persist,” said Killol Pandya,
who manages $300 million as the Mumbai-based head of fixed
income at Daiwa Mutual Fund. “The central bank may raise rates
again.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.29 percent as of
9:53 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That was the highest since June 1.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose seven basis points to 7.96 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
