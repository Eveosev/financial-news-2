Zeder Investments Ltd. (ZED)  offered 485.9
million rand ($72 million) to buy the shares in Capespan Group
Ltd., southern  Africa ’s biggest fresh fruit  exporter , that it
doesn’t already own to help finance the company’s expansion.  Zeder offered 2.25 rand per share for the 72.3 percent of
closely held Capespan that it doesn’t already own, it said in a
statement to the Stock Exchange News Service in Johannesburg
today. That's a 30 percent premium to Capespan’s average share
price over the last 30 days, Stellenbosch, South Africa-based
Zeder said.  “Finance and patience will be required,” to help Cape
Town-based Capespan recapture market share it has lost in recent
year, Zeder said.  South Africa  is Africa’s largest fruit
producer.  Zeder holds investments in agriculture companies ranging
from wine producer Capevin Holdings Ltd. to farm services
company Kaap Agri. Capespan has operations in 34 countries and
exports fruit including oranges, apricots, avocados, pears and
grapes. The company had revenue of 2.68 billion rand last year.  Zeder was unchanged at 2.50 rand as of 10:46 a.m. in
Johannesburg trading, giving the company a market value of 2.45
billion rand. PSG Capital, the corporate finance unit of  PSG
Group Ltd. (PSG) , is advising Zeder on the offer and Zeder has no
plans to change Capespan’s board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
