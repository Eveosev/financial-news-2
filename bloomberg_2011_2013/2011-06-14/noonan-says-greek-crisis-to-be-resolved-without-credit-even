Irish Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said European authorities will find resolution to the
Greek debt crisis that isn’t classed as a default.  “A satisfactory resolution will be brought about, which
will not be a  credit event ,” Noonan said in an interview on
CNBC television in New York today. “But Ireland will be
watching very closely.”  A meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels today
is one of a series on a new Greek bailout, with the region’s
leaders due to hold a summit on June 23-24. Noonan said there
are a “number of options on the table” for Greece. German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said earlier that a decision
won’t be taken today, while repeating that he wants a private-
sector contribution to Greek aid.  The Irish government does not want a solution for  Greece  to
amount to a “credit event” that could have a “contagion
effect for Ireland,” Noonan said. “We’re totally different to
Greece. We have our bank restructuring in place, we have our
fiscal programs in place.”  -- Editors: Fergal O’Brien, Alan Crawford  To contact the reporter on this story:
