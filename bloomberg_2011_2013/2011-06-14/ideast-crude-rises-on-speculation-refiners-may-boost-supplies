Middle East crude oil climbed on
speculation that Asian refiners may boost purchases as
processing profits rebound.  Qatar Land crude rose $1.27, or 1.1 percent, to $114.76 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bangalore. Dubai oil for
loading in August advanced 0.3 percent to $111.11 a barrel.
Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., increased 0.5
percent to $116.  Refiners may be buying more crude as gasoil’s premium to
Dubai crude, a measure of refining profit, has climbed this
month. The price difference, known as the crack spread, rose 54
cents to $21.45 a barrel today, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based brokerage. That’s up from $18.43
at the end of May.  Oman futures for August delivery climbed 45 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $112.10 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange ,
with 1,120 contracts traded. The settlement price was at $111.83
at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July narrowed 33
cents to $8.05 a barrel, data from PVM showed. The exchange for
swaps for August fell 24 cents to $7.21 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
