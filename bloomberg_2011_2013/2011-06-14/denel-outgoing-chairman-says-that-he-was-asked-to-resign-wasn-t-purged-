Denel Ltd.’s outgoing Chairman
Sibusiso Sibisi said he asked to resign from his position at
 South Africa ’s state-owned defense contractor after 13 years and
wasn’t removed because of a “purge of the board” by Public
Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba.  Sibisi first asked to resign in 2008 after 10 years as
chairman, he said in a letter published today by Johannesburg-
based Business Day newspaper. The department hasn’t contacted
him since the Cabinet announced his replacement on June 9,
Sibisi said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
