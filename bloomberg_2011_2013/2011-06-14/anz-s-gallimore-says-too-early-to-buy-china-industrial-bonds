Owen Gallimore, head of credit
trading strategy for  Asia  at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group, comments on the investment outlook for high-yield bonds
issued by Chinese industrial companies. He spoke at the Asia-
Pacific Debt Investor Forum in  Hong Kong  today.  “The million-dollar question is obviously whether any of
these industrial, high-yield Chinese companies that have been
weak in the past few weeks and months offer some value. At this
stage, it’s still too early for people to be going there trying
to get value. There’s always the possibility of another negative
headline in the next few months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
