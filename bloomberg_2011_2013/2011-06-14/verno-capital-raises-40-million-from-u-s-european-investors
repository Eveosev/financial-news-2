Verno Capital, the Russian
investment firm which received $100 million from Abu Dhabi
sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Development in November, has
attracted an additional $40 million from three U.S. and European
institutional investors.  One of the three mandates was a commitment from a U.S.
endowment fund, Vernoâ€™s Moscow-based spokesman Quinn Martin said
by phone today. The new fund is managed by Bruce Bower, who was
hired last year from Kazimir Partners, Martin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
