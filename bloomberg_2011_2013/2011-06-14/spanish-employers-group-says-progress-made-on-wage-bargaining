Changes to wage-bargaining rules
approved by  Spain ’s  Cabinet  last week are an improvement on the
draft version presented by the government, the head of the
country’s main business group said.  “What’s clear is that there is a big difference between
what there was last Wednesday and what there was at the
weekend,” Juan Rosell, chairman of the group, known as  CEOE ,
told reporters after giving a speech in the northern Spanish
city of Santander today. “There is an important change and
let’s see if it bears fruit.”  The CEOE criticized a draft version of the rules presented
June 8, saying they didn’t go far enough in making labor
legislation more flexible as Spain bids to bring down an
unemployment rate of more than 21 percent. Finance Minister
Elena Salgado defended the text passed by the Cabinet on June
10, saying it was an improvement on the draft.  Among the changes to the new law, passed by decree on June
10, is a clause that stops expired wage agreements being
indefinitely rolled over in the absence of new deals, Salgado
said. The new text also states “clearly” that wage deals
negotiated at a company level take precedence over provincial
agreements, Salgado said.  Changes to  labor laws  are part of the government’s efforts
to convince investors it can spur enough growth to rein in the
euro region’s third-largest deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
