OAO  Razgulay Group (GRAZ) ,  Russia ’s largest
rice producer, plans to sell assets, Chairman Rustem Mirgalimov
said.  Razgulay plans to sell assets including silos and arable
lands located more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) from its
“core” sugar refineries to potential strategic investors
including state grain trader United Grain Co., Mirgalimov said
today. The company aims to reduce so-called debt leverage by
between 7 billion rubles ($251 million) and 20 billion rubles,
he said.  Debt to the company’s major creditor, Vnesheconombank, came
to 24.5 billion rubles by the end of 2010, board member Dmitry
Shteinsapir said. “Long-term” debts to the bank are about 19
billion rubles, Shteinsapir said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
