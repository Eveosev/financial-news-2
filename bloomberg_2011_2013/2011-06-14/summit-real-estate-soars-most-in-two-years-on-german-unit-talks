Summit Real Estate Holdings Ltd. (SMT) , a
manager and developer of property projects, surged the most in
more than two years on talks to sell its stake in Summit Germany
or bring in a strategic investor.  The shares jumped as much as 14 percent, the most since
April 2009, and were 10 percent higher at 5.83 shekels as of
11:55 a.m. in  Tel Aviv , giving the Migdal Haemek, Israel-based
company a market value of 391 million shekels ($115 million).  A transaction would be based on the unit’s private capital
with adjustments corresponding to values demanded in similar
deals, Summit Real Estate said late yesterday in a  statement  to
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The unit’s private capital was 164
million euros ($237 million) as of March 31, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
