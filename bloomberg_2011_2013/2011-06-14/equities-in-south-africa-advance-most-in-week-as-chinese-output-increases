South African stocks rose the most
in a week, led by commodities producers including  Anglo American
Plc (AAL) ,  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  and  Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , as  China ’s industrial
production rose more than economists forecast.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index advanced as much as 0.8
percent,the biggest intraday gain since June 7, before trading
0.6 percent higher at 31,358.11 by 10:10 a.m. in Johannesburg.  Chinese industrial output gained 13.3 percent, exceeding a
median 13.1 percent forecast while fixed-asset investments also
increased. China ordered lenders to set aside more cash as
reserves after inflation accelerated to 5.5 percent a year in
May, the fastest rate in almost three years.  Anglo American, a diversified mining company, rallied 1.6
percent to 326.47 rand, heading for the biggest gain since May
26.  BHP Billiton  increased for a second day, jumping 1.5 percent
to 256.24 rand.  Sasol, the world’s largest maker of automobile and jet fuel
from coal, snapped two days of losses, gaining 1.6 percent to
351.46 rand. Improved market conditions, a “solid operational
performance” and cost containment will benefit its operating
profit in the 2011 fiscal year, Sasol said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
