China agreed to loan  Ecuador  $1
billion to finance public works projects including irrigation
canals, hydroelectric dams and oil exploration, Diario Expreso
said today, citing unidentified officials at the South American
country’s  Finance Ministry .  The loan, which will have an average interest rate of 7
percent, was agreed to last week and will be disbursed in the
coming weeks, the Guayaquil-based  newspaper  said on its website.
The government is also negotiating another $1 billion loan with
different creditors, Expreso said, without providing more
details.  Ecuador’s Finance Ministry and the Economic Policy Ministry
didn’t immediately respond to telephone and e-mail messages from
Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
