Spain sold 5.4 billion euros ($7.8
billion) of Treasury bills, just below its maximum target, even
as its borrowing costs rose after  Standard & Poor’s  said  Greece 
is likely to face the euro area’s first sovereign default.  The Treasury said it sold 3.96 billion euros of 12-month
bills at an average yield of 2.695 percent, compared with 2.546
percent the last time the securities were sold on May 17. It
also sold 1.46 billion euros of 18-month debt at an average
yield of 3.26 percent, compared with 3.095 percent last month.
It was aiming to sell a maximum of 5.5 billion euros of the
debt.  Demand for the 12-month bills was 2.85 times the amount
sold, compared with 2.5 last month, and the bid-to-cover for the
longer-maturity debt was 3.91 times, compared with 4.12.  “Demand was healthy, but  Spain  had to pay a high price to
sell almost all the amount announced, a reflection of the
current tensions in the peripheral universe,”  Chiara Cremonesi ,
a fixed income strategist at Unicredit Bank AG said in a note.  Spain’s Socialist government is trying to shield the euro
region’s fourth-largest economy from the sovereign debt crisis
as the European Central Bank and Germany battle over how to bail
out Greece for a second time. S&P cut Greece’s credit rating
yesterday to CCC, the lowest for any sovereign nation. The move
may weigh on demand for debt today as Greece,  Italy  and Belgium
also hold auctions.  Italy plans to sell as much as 3.5 billion euros of bonds
due in 2016,  Belgium  aims to sell 2.3 billion euros of bills and
Greece auctions at least 1.25 billion euros of 182-day
securities.  The gap between Spanish and German borrowing costs narrowed
after the sale to 247 basis points, from as wide as 252 before
the auction. That compares with an average of 15 basis points in
the first decade of monetary union. Growing expectations of a
Greek default pushed 10-year Greek yields to 17 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
