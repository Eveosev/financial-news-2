Vietnam ’s five-year bonds were
little changed, leaving their yield near this month’s low, amid
speculation improved liquidity at banks will boost demand for
 government securities . The dong weakened.  The State Treasury sold 3 trillion dong ($146 million) of
five-year and three-year bonds on June 9 at yields of 12.65
percent and 12.7 percent, respectively, according to the Hanoi
Stock Exchange. The treasury sold 2 trillion dong of bonds with
similar maturities to yield 13 percent on June 2, according to
the bourse.  “Liquidity at banks is quite good now,” said Dam Trung Kien, a Hanoi-based trader at Bao Viet Fund Management Co., a
unit of Vietnam’s biggest insurer. “Given increasing bad-debt
ratios and the limit on credit growth, many banks have turned to
invest in  government bonds .”  Vietnam has reduced its credit growth target for this year
to less than 20 percent from 23 percent as part of its monetary
policy tightening to contain inflation. Bad-debt ratios at
commercial banks are about 3 percent and may worsen this year,
Nguyen Van Binh, deputy governor of the central bank said June 9.  The yield on the benchmark five-year note was little
changed at 12.71 percent, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 12.69 percent on June 8, the
lowest level since May 23.  The dong slipped 0.1 percent to 20,565 per dollar as of
4:10 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,618 today, unchanged
from yesterday, according to its website. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of that rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editors: James Regan  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
