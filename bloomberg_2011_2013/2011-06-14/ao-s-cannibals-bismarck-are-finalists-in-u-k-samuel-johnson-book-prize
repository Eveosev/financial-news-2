“Mao’s Great Famine,” a chilling
chronicle of how  Mao Zedong  starved at least 45 million people,
driving some to cannibalism, made the final round in the  BBC
Samuel Johnson Prize , an annual U.K. nonfiction award worth
20,000 pounds ($32,770) to the winner.  Frank Dikotter’s chronicle of what he calls the world’s
greatest man-made famine will compete against titles on topics
ranging from Otto von Bismarck to the English Cavaliers and the
artist Caravaggio, the organizers said in an e-mailed statement.  A fixture in the U.K. literary calendar, the Samuel Johnson
Prize is sponsored by the British Broadcasting Corp. This year’s
selection of finalists offers “a tribute to the breadth and
depth of non-fiction writing,” the chair of the judging panel,
 Ben Macintyre , said in the release.  The finalists are “Mao’s Great Famine” ( Bloomsbury );
“Caravaggio” by Andrew Graham-Dixon ( Allen Lane ); “Liberty’s
Exiles” by Maya Jasanoff (HarperPress); “The Rational
Optimist” by Matt Ridley (Fourth Estate); “Bismarck” by
Jonathan Steinberg (Oxford); and “Reprobates” by John Stubbs
(Viking).  The winner will be announced in a ceremony at the  Royal
Institute of British Architects  on July 6.  To contact the reporter on the story:
