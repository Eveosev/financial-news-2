U.S. Representative  Michele Bachmann , a Minnesota Republican known for her uncompromising
views and firebrand style, said today that she plans to run for
the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.  “I filed my paperwork to seek the office of the presidency
today,” said Bachmann, 55, a favorite of Tea Party and anti-
abortion activists, during a Republican presidential debate
sponsored by  CNN .  Her filing with the  Federal Election Commission  allows
Bachmann to begin fundraising and other organizational efforts
for a presidential bid. Bachmann said she would “very soon”
formally announce her candidacy.  A knack for grabbing the spotlight catapulted Bachmann, who
won her House seat in 2006, into a frequent guest on cable
television news program, a fundraising dynamo and a Tea Party
heroine.  She has used her platform to become an uncompromising
spokeswoman for conservative positions on social and fiscal
issues, prodding Republican leaders not to cooperate with
President Barack Obama’s administration.  “I am willing to fight for what I believe in, and that’s
one thing that people see,” she said an April 29 interview with
Bloomberg News in Manchester,  New Hampshire . “I’m not just
there to go along and get along.”  Bachmann had been measuring support for a run during visits
this year to Iowa, New Hampshire and  South Carolina , states with
early contests in the nomination process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
