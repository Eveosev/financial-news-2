Linden Ponds Inc. , which operates a
108-acre retirement community in Hingham,  Massachusetts , sought
U.S.  Bankruptcy Court  protection in Dallas, citing as much as
$500 million each in assets and debts, including $156 million in
state development bonds.  “Linden Ponds has suffered a substantial loss of revenue
and lower than anticipated absorption rates” as a result of the
struggling economy, limited access to capital and declining real
estate values, Paul Rundell, plan administrator for Senior
Living Retirement Communities LLC, said in court papers.  Senior Living is the sole owner of Hingham Campus LLC,
which also sought protection today. Hingham was formed to
purchase the land and has ownership until the community is sold
to Linden Ponds.  Linden Ponds, which opened in 2004, is a 998-unit
continuing-care complex. Seniors are offered services from
independent living to skilled nursing, allowing them to remain
in the same place as they age and their needs change. The
community operates under a lease agreement between Linden Ponds
and Hingham.  Senior Living, previously known as Erickson Retirement
Communities LLC, the prior manager and developer of Linden
Ponds, filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2009.  The case is In re Hingham Campus LLC, 11-33912,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of  Texas  (Dallas).  To contact the reporters on this story:
