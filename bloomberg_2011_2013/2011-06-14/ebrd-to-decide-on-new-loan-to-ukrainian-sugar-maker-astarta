Astarta Holding NV (AST) , a Ukrainian
sugar maker, may get a senior secure loan worth $80 million
from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to
consolidate existing borrowing and to expand infrastructure.  The London-based EBRD will decide about the loan at a
board meeting on July 12, the bank said on its  Website  today.
The money would be spent to “consolidate existing EBRD
loans” and also for long term financing of the company’s
infrastructure in agriculture and sugar production.  Astarta seeks to expand its land bank and also to
construct a dairy farm, according to the EBRD website. The
project will also result in energy efficiency improvement.  Ukrainian sugar maker Astarta has so far received three
loans from the EBRD totaling around $45 million.  To contact the reporters for this story:
