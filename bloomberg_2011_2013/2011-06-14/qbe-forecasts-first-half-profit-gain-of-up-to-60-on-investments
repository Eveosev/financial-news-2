QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE)  shares fell
the most in 11 months in Sydney trading after  Australia ’s
largest insurer by market value forecast a narrower insurance
margin after “unprecedented” claims from catastrophes.  The stock dropped 3.9 percent to A$16.60 at 10:36 a.m. in
Sydney, the biggest drop since July 26, 2010. After-tax profit
for the six months ending June 30 will be 50 percent to 60
percent higher than the $440 million earned a year earlier,
Sydney-based QBE said in a statement late yesterday.  “Elevated catastrophe claims mean that QBE’s first half
insurance margin will likely be at its lowest level in seven
years,” said Sydney-based analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc including Richard Coles in a note to investors. “It
would now appear quite a stretch for QBE to achieve the bottom
end of its full-year guidance, despite putting through
substantial price increases in catastrophe affected
portfolios.”  Large claims of $2.5 million or more through May, net of
reinsurance, rose to $830 million, QBE said, following damage
from Cyclone Yasi, floods in Queensland, and earthquakes in  New
Zealand  and  Japan . That’s $340 million higher than the first
half of last year and compares with $1.08 billion for all of
2010  The dividend for the first half is expected to be
maintained at 62 Australian cents a share, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
