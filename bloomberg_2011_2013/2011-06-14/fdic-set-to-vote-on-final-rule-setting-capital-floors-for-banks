The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
board is scheduled to vote on a final rule that would bar the
nation’s largest lenders from reducing their capital levels
below baselines set for smaller banks.  The measure being weighed by the FDIC board today at a
meeting in  Washington , is part of the agency’s mandate under the
Dodd-Frank Act. The joint-agency rule with the  Federal Reserve 
and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would also
hold large financial holding companies to the same  capital
requirements  as their subsidiaries that take insured deposits.  The rule, included in Dodd-Frank at the request of U.S.
Senator Susan Collins of Maine, would take effect 30 days after
it is published in the Federal Register if approved by
regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
