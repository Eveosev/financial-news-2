U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains, signaling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may advance for
a second day, after government data on retail sales was better
than economists estimated.  Futures on the S&P 500 rose 1 percent to 1,278.7 at 8:32
a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones Industrial Average futures advanced
86 points, or 0.7 percent, to 11,971.  The 0.2 percent decrease in retail sales was smaller than
forecast and followed a 0.3 percent April gain that was less
than previously estimated, Commerce Department figures showed.
The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was
a drop of 0.5 percent.   Futures advanced earlier after China reported that
industrial production climbed more than estimated in May, while
inflation last month accelerated to the fastest pace in almost
three years. Production gained 13.3 percent from the year
before, exceeding the median economist forecast of 13.1 percent
in a Bloomberg survey. The 5.5 percent annual gain in consumer
prices matched estimates.  U.S. stocks rose yesterday, with the  S&P 500  rebounding
from an almost three-month low, as a pickup in takeovers and the
cheapest valuations in almost a year helped offset concern that
the economic recovery is faltering.  More than $1 trillion has been erased from U.S. equity
markets since the S&P 500’s peak on April 29, leaving the
measure trading at about 12.8 times its companies’ estimated
earnings for 2011. That’s the cheapest valuation since August.  The S&P 500 has fallen 6.7 percent from the end of April
through June 10 as sales of existing homes unexpectedly
declined, the  unemployment rate  rose and concern escalated that
one or more European countries will fail to repay all their
debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
