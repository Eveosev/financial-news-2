A group of online hackers identified
the Federal Reserve as a target, using a  video  on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
YouTube to call on Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to resign.  In the video, the group, which calls itself Anonymous, said
today would mark the “first step” of protests against Bernanke
and urged those wanting him to quit to occupy a public space.  “The Federal Reserve’s policies are systematically looting
the country to enrich one 10th of 1 percent of the population,”
a distorted voice said on the video.  The group attacked several Turkish government websites last
week to protest an Internet filter it says will restrict web
surfing, the Hurriyet newspaper reported. Spanish police also
arrested three suspected members after the websites of  Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain’s second-biggest bank, and
 Enel SpA (ENEL) , the Italian owner of Spanish power company Endesa SA,
were hacked.  Anonymous also took credit for taking down the websites of
Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. in December in revenge for the
payment processors’ decision to suspend use of their networks by
WikiLeaks, an organization that publishes secret documents on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
