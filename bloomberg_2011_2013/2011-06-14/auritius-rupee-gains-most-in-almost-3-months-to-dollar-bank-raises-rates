Mauritius’s rupee strengthened the
most in almost three months against the dollar after the central
bank raised its benchmark rate to curb inflation.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s currency appreciated as
much as 2 percent to 28 per dollar and traded 1.9 percent
stronger at 28.05 by 10:58 a.m. in the capital,  Port Louis . That
made it the second-best performer worldwide against the dollar
today after Solomon Islands’ dollar, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Yesterday’s quarter of a percent rise is almost
equivalent to the yearly yield on the dollar, for instance,”
Nitish Benimadhu, a  fund manager  at the Port Louis-based Anglo
Mauritius Financial Services Ltd., said by phone today. “This
attracts hot money.”  The Bank of Mauritius raised its key repo rate to 5.5
percent following a quarterly Monetary Policy Committee meeting,
the second increase in three months. The rupee has gained 10
percent against the dollar since the start of 2011.  “Market sentiment and momentum for the rupee are
stretching,” Benimadhu said. “The rupee is not expected to
weaken in the next six months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
