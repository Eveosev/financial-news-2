June 15 (Bloomberg) -- Maqbool Fida Husain, the most famous and flamboyant and most marketable Indian painter of the 20th Century, and, in the eyes of many, the greatest,  passed away June 9  at the ripe age of 95. What was especially tragic about his demise was that this versatile and vigorous interpreter of Indian history and mythology, whose work also gave voice to  many of the great currents and tumultuous developments  in the past century of Indian life, was at the time of his death a reluctant, if resigned, Qatari national. In 2006, Husain fled  India  after  repeated harassment  from Hindu right-wing groups, which used  antiquated libel laws  to attack what they considered a Muslim's insolence in depicting Hindu gods and goddesses. Husain's decision to leave his beloved homeland was probably prudent, given the many demonstrations in the last decade of the Indian state's insufficient commitment to  defending freedom of expression  in art and dissenting or  controversial opinion  in scholarship. The advance of history doesn't always signal progress: Husain passed away in a decade more censorious and hostile to artistic freedom than any other in his working life. If I don't immediately cut to the widely discussed political and social reverberations of Husain's demise, it is only to respect the fact that his name and reputation deserve to be associated with many things beyond the sorry spectacle of his closing years. One of the best assessments of his career was provided by the art critic Girish Shahane, who wrote in the  newspaper Mint : Shahane observed that Husain's greatest legacy was "to have created a modernism with specifically Indian properties"; this was echoed by  C Uday Bhaskar  in The Economic Times: For long, Husain's irreverence, joie de vivre, ability to mix with both high and low (one commentator wrote of how he favored both " bare feet and Bugattis ") and embrace of Indian narratives and popular culture found a hospitable home in India. He painted whole series of paintings on the epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, while also publicly declaringÂ  several Bollywood actresses as his muses, most famously Madhuri Dixit. As Siddharth Bhatia  wrote in DNA : But as the Hindu right wing grew politically more powerful and publicly more strident in the 1990s and into the new century, complex figures like Husain, at home in several traditions, became sitting ducks for the politics of identity and chauvinism. Right-wing groups repeatedly vandalized Husain exhibitions and filed cases in court against him. Balasaheb Thackeray, the belligerent leader of the  Shiv Sena , a right-wing party that has considerable support in Maharashtra, famously  asked in 1998 , equating art's crossing of boundaries with dissenters' invasion of physical space, "If Husain can enter Hindustan [India] why can't we enter his house?" In 2006, Husain was attacked by a right-wing cultural organization called the  Hindu Janjagruti Samiti  (loosely, the Association For The Mass Revival of Hinduism) for a  painting  he had made of a nude woman in the shape of the map of India. He was forced to  apologize . Shortly afterward, he left the country for Dubai, where the journalist Shoma Chaudhury found him in good spirits in 2008 in an excellent essay called " The Master In His Absurd Exile ." India's liberal press unanimously decried Husain's death in forced exile. But the truth was that a substantial section of Indian opinion, and not just the right-wing fringe, held that Husain has crossed the boundaries of artistic license. The idea that art should respect religious sensitivities, that nudity is much the same as obscenity, and that the meaning of an artist's work may be extrapolated from his religious or ethnic identity carries a surprising degree of currency in Indian public opinion. In a perceptive piece called " The artist, not the art ," the cultural commentator Santosh Desai remarked: MSN India  reported that in an Internet poll: And the Hindu Janjagruti Samiti, which hounded Husain in 2006, posted a  reaction  on its website that was fairly typical of a certain kind of response, and ended with a loaded question that launched an opinion poll of its own: And Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, himself once upon a time a political cartoonist, was similarly churlish.  The Hindu reported : That last "may his Allah" is revealing, and shows in its own way how an emphasis on religion can be used to fuel resentment and division in India today. As  Salman Rushdie  pointed out only a few months ago at a conclave in  New Delhi , In one of the best accounts on Husain's checkered life and career and the milieu in which he worked,  Sadanand Menon  in the Hindu concluded by saying: (Chandrahas Choudhury is the New Delhi correspondent for the World View blog.
