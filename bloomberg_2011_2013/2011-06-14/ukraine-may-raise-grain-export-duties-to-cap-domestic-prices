Ukraine’s government may raise
export duties on grain that take effect from July 1 should
domestic prices jump, researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  The duty is set at 9 percent for wheat, 12 percent for corn
and 14 percent for barley.  The former Soviet state may ship as much as 20 million
metric tons of grain in the marketing year that starts July 1 if
the duty rates remain as announced, the Kiev-based researcher
said today in an e-mailed report. Ukraine, once the world’s
largest barley exporter, limited cereals shipments this
marketing year by imposing quotas to cap domestic prices.  The country’s  Agriculture Ministry  also wants to introduce
an export tax for rapeseed, UkrAgroConsult said.  Ukraine may increase areas planted with sunflower-seed
to 5.1 million hectares (12.6 million acres) this year, the
researcher said. Ukraine may export 1.5 million tons of grain
this month, the highest monthly volume for this season,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
