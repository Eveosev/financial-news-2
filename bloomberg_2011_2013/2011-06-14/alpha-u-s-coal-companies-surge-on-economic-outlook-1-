Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) , the
world’s third-largest producer of steelmaking coal, led other
U.S. coal companies higher as retail sales fell less than
expected.  Alpha gained $1.90, or 4.3 percent, to $45.68 at 12:18 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Peabody Energy
Corp. (BTU) , the largest U.S. coal producer, jumped $2.27, or 4.3
percent, to $55.49.  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) , the second-biggest U.S. coal
company, added $1.07, or 4.3 percent, to $26.22.  Equities rose after a Commerce Department report showed
sales at U.S. retailers decreased 0.2 percent compared with the
median forecast for a 0.5 percent drop in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. Coal, used to generate electricity or
manufacture steel, is a barometer for the economy.  “Everything is pretty strong today,” said Jim Rollyson,
an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. in Houston. “They
had mostly been going in the wrong direction lately.”  Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX) , a producer with mines in Appalachia and
the Illinois Basin, rose 76 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $21.33.
 Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , a coal and natural-gas company, increased
$1.26, or 2.7 percent, to $48.41.  Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) , a Southern
Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal, added $3.33, or 3
percent, to $115.28.  To contact the reporter on this story: Mario Parker in Chicago
