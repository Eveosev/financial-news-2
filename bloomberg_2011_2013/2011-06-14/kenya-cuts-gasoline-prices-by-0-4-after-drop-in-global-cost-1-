Kenya  will cut the cost of so-called
super petrol, the most commonly used gasoline, by 0.4 percent in
the capital, Nairobi.  The decision will reduce the price of a liter (0.3 gallon)
of super petrol to 114.93 shillings ($1.29) from tomorrow until
July 14, the Nairobi-based  Energy Regulatory Commission  said in
its monthly review of fuel costs, emailed today. It follows a
“marginal” decrease in the crude price last month. Nairobi
accounts for as much as 55 percent of fuel consumption in the
East African country.  Kenya’s inflation rate rose for the seventh straight month
in May to a 25-month high of 13 percent on higher food and fuel
costs. The transport price index, which includes the cost of
petrol, rose 22 percent. The central bank increased its
benchmark interest rate for the second time this year in May, by
a quarter-point to 6.25 percent, to cool inflation.  The price of kerosene, which is used for cooking and
lighting, will drop by 6.9 shillings per liter in Nairobi after
the government removed excise duty on the fuel, while diesel
will decrease by 1.72 shillings per liter, the commission said.  Mombasa-based  Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd. , jointly
owned by Essar Energy Overseas Ltd. and the government, shut
down one of its manufacturing units for maintenance last month,
which had a “negative impact” on output, the commission said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
