Liliane Bettencourt, heir to the
founder of  L’Oreal SA (OR) , should be placed under a court-appointed
guardianship in light of her mental and physical health,
according to a report by three doctors,  Agence France-Presse 
reported today.  The doctors recommended she have a guardian to oversee
management of her estate and private expenses, AFP said, citing
the report submitted to a judge in May.  A request by Bettencourt’s daughter for a guardian to be
appointed, which she dropped in March, will be reviewed by
France’s highest appeals court this month to determine whether
the process can continue without her support, AFP said.  Bettencourt’s lawyer and spokeswoman, and a lawyer for her
daughter, didn’t immediately return calls from Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
