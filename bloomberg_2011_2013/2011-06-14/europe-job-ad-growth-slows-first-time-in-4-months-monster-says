European online job-advertising
growth slowed for the first time in four months in May as
governments and defense companies curtailed hiring, recruiter
 Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW)  said.  The Monster Employment Index  Europe  fell to 135 from 136 in
April, New York-based Monster said in an e-mailed statement. The
gauge is up 21 percent from a year earlier.  “The decline in public-sector activity contrasts to the
slight growth of previous months and will be interesting to
monitor in terms of continuing calls for government cuts to
services across this sector,” Alan Townsend, Monster’s head of
operations for Europe, said in the report.  Monster’s employment index is based on job-search websites
from all European Union members, including Monster Worldwide’s
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
