Japan  will guarantee loans by banks
to the third-party organization established to ensure  Tokyo 
Electric Power Co. can compensate victims of the nuclear
accident, said Financial Services Minister Shozaburo Jimi.  “It’s a given that the government will provide loan
guarantees when the third-party entity is established,” Jimi
told reporters in Tokyo, reiterating a plan unveiled last month.
“Making sure that compensation is paid in a smooth manner,
while keeping a stable supply of power, is very important.”  Jimi spoke after the Cabinet today approved a disaster
compensation bill to help  Tokyo Electric , the owner of the
crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, pay reparations. The
utility said today that it is preparing compensation for victims
of the disaster after a record March 11 earthquake and tsunami
wrecked the atomic station, leading to radiation leaks.  The cost of dismantling the Fukushima plant may reach 20
trillion yen ($249 billion), and compensation for households in
a 20-kilometer evacuation zone may total 630 billion yen over 10
years, according to the  Japan Center for Economic Research .  To contact the reporter on this story:
