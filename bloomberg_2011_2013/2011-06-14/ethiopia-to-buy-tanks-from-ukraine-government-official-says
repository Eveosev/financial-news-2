Ethiopia  plans to purchase tanks
from Ukraine, a government spokesman said, without providing
details.  The vehicles are necessary to protect the country from
hostile forces such as its Horn of Africa neighbor Eritrea,
Shimeles Kemal said in a phone interview today. Eritrea and
Ethiopia fought a 1998-2000 border war that killed 70,000
people, according to Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  “Ethiopia is doing its level best to achieve rapid
development in all aspects,” Shimeles said from Debre Zeit,
Ethiopia. “This is among other things, building the national
defense system and ensuring the safety of its people and
preserving its territorial integrity.”  Ukrainian-based news agency Kommersant reported on June 10
that the deal included 200 tanks for about $100 million.  Ethiopia plans to increase its national budget for the
fiscal year beginning July 8, Shimeles said. Defense spending
has only seen a “slight increase,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
