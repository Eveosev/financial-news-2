Chinese stocks rose in  New York , led
by  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , as the prospect of a resolution to the
U.S. budget impasse boosts the outlook for China’s second-
largest trading partner.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in New York climbed 0.5 percent to 97.67
yesterday in New York, the highest since May 11. Property
website company SouFun surged to a seven-month high, while  Focus
Media Holding Ltd. (FMCN)  rose a fourth day after agreeing to be
acquired in the nation’s biggest leveraged buyout. Solar stocks
retreated, paring monthly gains of at least 8.6 percent, amid
speculation state support won’t boost profitability in the
industry.  LDK Solar Co. (LDK)  sank the most in two months.  The China-US gauge followed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
higher after U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner  said he expects to
keep working on a plan with President  Barack Obama  to avert more
than $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts due to come
into force starting in January. The economy of the U.S., the
biggest buyer of Chinese goods this year, grew 3.1 percent in
the third quarter, more than previously reported.  “Anything that indicates that there are at least
discussions, any type of progress, is going to help the equity
market,”  Timothy Ghriskey , chief investment officer at New
York-based Solaris Group LLC, which manages about $2 billion,
including Chinese stocks, said by phone yesterday. “If there
were something more significant said, you would see a much
bigger rise.”  ETF Advances  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 0.7 percent to $39.75
in New York, the highest price in nine months. The ETF has risen
14 percent this year. The  S&P 500  rose 0.6 percent to 1,443.69.  SouFun, owner of the largest real estate information
website in China, jumped 7.5 percent to $25, the highest level
since May 10. Trading volume was almost three times the daily
average over the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Focus Media’s American depositary receipts added 0.9
percent in their fourth day of gains to $25.74, the highest
close since March 28.  The Shanghai-based digital advertising company agreed to be
bought by a group of private-equity investors led by Carlyle
Group LP, according to a Dec. 19 statement. The company’s ADRs
will be bought for $27.50 each, higher than the initial offer of
$27 apiece in August.  The transaction, valuing the company’s equity at about $3.7
billion, is scheduled to close in the second quarter of 2013
after approval from at least two-thirds of shareholders.  LDK Tumbles  LDK, the world’s second-largest maker of solar wafers,
tumbled 11 percent to $1.27, sinking the most in two months. The
Xinyu, China-based company said in Dec. 14 filing that it was
seeking consent from investors to take on more debt. The company
will offer noteholders 10  yuan  ($1.60) for every 10,000 yuan
they hold in its notes due in 2014 with conditions including
allowing LDK to take on more debt, according to the document.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  the world’s biggest solar-panel
maker, based in China’s Jiangsu province, declined 4 percent to
$1.21, the biggest slump in a month. Suntech’s advance this
month was cut to 33 percent. Ten-day  volatility  on Suntech’s
shares rose to 110 yesterday, the highest level since Nov. 14.  Solars Slump  Subsidies for more than 100 new energy projects, tax breaks
and tariff adjustments for the sector announced by China’s
government in December have helped drive a 49 percent surge in
 Trina (TSL)  Solar Ltd., the Guangzhou-based solar maker that is the
 biggest gainer  on the China-US gauge this month.  While state assistance may bolster sales for some
companies, it probably won’t stoke an increase in profitability
for an industry hobbled by falling prices and a panel supply
glut, according to  Raymond James  & Associates Inc.  Guangzhou-based Trina slid 3.4 percent to $4.21 in New York
yesterday.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , based in Baoding,
China, retreated 3.3 percent to $2.34.  “The measures so far are counterproductive, they should
let bad companies go bankrupt and let capacity rationalization
happen,” Alex Morris, an energy analyst at Raymond James, said
by phone yesterday from Houston. “Investors should take the
opportunity of this junk rally to actively short these solar
stocks.”  Bona Film Group Ltd., a film production company, was the
biggest decliner on the China-US measure, losing 13 percent to
$4.28, the steepest slump since Dec. 9, 2010. Volumes were
almost double the daily average over the past three months.  Growth Outlook  The Conference Board’s leading index for  China’s economy 
released yesterday rose 1.1 percent in November, from a revised
1.6 percent gain in the previous month. Economic growth -- which
slowed to 7.4 percent in the third quarter, the slowest pace
since the first three months of 2009 -- may accelerate to 7.8
percent this quarter, based on the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Dec. 13 to 18.  Shanda Games Ltd. (GAME) , China’s third-largest online games
operator, rallied 3.3 percent to a three-week high of $3.17.
 Home Inns & Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN) , the largest budget hotel
chain operator in China, added 2.6 percent to $28.78, the
highest close since Nov. 6.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 0.3 percent
yesterday to 11,352.45, after rising in the previous two days.
The gauge has climbed 14 percent in 2012. The  Shanghai Composite
Index (SHCOMP)  gained 0.3 percent to 2,168.35, the highest level in four
months, trimming its drop this year to 1.4 percent. The China-US
measure has added 8.4 percent in 2012.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards on the yuan fell 0.08
percent to 6.3150 per dollar yesterday, weakening the most since
Dec. 11, after the currency closed little changed versus the
greenback at 6.2302 in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System.  China will increase the movement of the yuan  exchange rate 
“appropriately” to handle an influx of liquidity amid new
rounds of quantitative easing from the world’s central banks,
the official Xinhua News Agency said in an editorial yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
