Exchange companies can either merge
or risk being marginalized by competition, according to NYSE
Euronext Chief Executive Officer  Duncan Niederauer .  “We’re in an industry where scale is essential,” he said
in a Bloomberg Television interview today. “It’s an imperative,
it’s not going to change, and consolidation is therefore an
inevitability.”  IntercontinentalExchange Inc., the 12-year-old energy and
commodities bourse, said today it agreed to acquire the owner of
the  New York  Stock Exchange for cash and stock worth $8.2
billion, moving to control of the biggest equities market.  While NYSE’s planned merger with Deutsche Boerse AG was
blocked by European competition authorities in February,
Niederauer said he expects today’s deal today be approved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
