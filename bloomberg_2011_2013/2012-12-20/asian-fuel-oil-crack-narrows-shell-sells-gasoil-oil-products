Asia ’s  fuel oil  crack spread
narrowed for the first time this week.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
sold gasoil and jet fuel in Singapore, the region’s largest oil-
trading center.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Asian marker Dubai crude narrowed 23
cents to $7.60 a barrel at 3:03 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack
spread narrowed for the first time this week.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged for a third day at
$10.25 a metric ton, PVM said. This means bunker, or marine
fuel, moved in tandem with supplies used in power stations.  Singapore ’s onshore stockpiles of residual fuels, including
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen,
dropped 553,000 barrels, or 2.7 percent, to 20 million barrels
in the week to yesterday, according to a unit of the Ministry of
Trade and Industry. That’s the lowest level in nine weeks.  Middle Distillates  Shell sold 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with 0.5
percent sulfur to Trafigura Beheer BV for Jan. 15 to Jan. 19
loading, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders who
monitored transactions on the Platts window. The cargo changed
hands at 90 cents a barrel below average December prices.
Amsterdam-based Trafigura has bought at least 15 cargoes of two
grades totaling 2.75 million barrels so far this month.  Shell also sold the same quantity of gasoil to Hin Leong
Trading Pte for Jan. 4 to Jan. 8, the earliest loading period,
the survey showed.  Europe ’s biggest oil company sold at a
discount of $2 a barrel to January prices.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rebounded $1.24 to $20.22 a
barrel at 3:03 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. This  crack
spread , a gauge of processing profit, widened for the first time
in five days.  Jet fuel dropped 5 cents to a  premium  of 5 cents a barrel
to gasoil, PVM data showed. This regrade is down for a second
day, indicating it is less profitable to make  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  PetroChina Co. bought 100,000 barrels of  jet fuel  from
Shell for Jan. 4 to Jan. 8 loading at a premium of 10 cents a
barrel above January prices, according to the survey.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $8.22 to $113.76 a ton at 5:32 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of the profit from making the petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock, widened for the first time in three days.  Glencore International Plc sold 25,000 tons of open-
specification naphtha for first-half February delivery to Itochu
Corp. and bought a first-half March cargo from the Tokyo-based
trader, according to the Bloomberg survey. The March shipment
traded at a discount of $14.50 a ton to the February cargo.  Glencore sold a second-half February naphtha cargo to
Marubeni Corp. and bought a second-half March shipment, the
survey showed. The earlier-delivered parcel traded at a premium
of $15.50 a ton to the later cargo. The world’s biggest
commodities trader also sold a first-half March cargo to Shell
and bought a first-half April shipment. The March cargo
transacted at a premium of $16 a ton to the April one.  BP Plc sold 95-RON gasoline to Phillips 66 in Singapore for
a second day, according to the survey. The 50,000-barrel cargo
will load from Jan. 11 to Jan. 15 and traded at $119.50 a
barrel. Arcadia Petroleum sold a similar-sized shipment of 92-
RON grade to Total SA loading Jan. 4 to Jan. 8 at $116.80 a
barrel.  Tenders  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. sold 720,000 barrels of gasoil
with 500 parts-per-million of sulfur and 300,000 barrels with 10
parts-per-million for January loading from Mailiao, said an
official who asked not to be identified because of company
policy. Taiwan’s only publicly traded refiner also bought
naphtha for January and offered 380-centistoke fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
