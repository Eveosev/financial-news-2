OZ Minerals Ltd. (OZL) ,  Australia ’s third-
biggest copper producer, said profit will drop more than 15
percent this year, with higher costs and lower production
continuing into next year.  “The expected operating result for the full year ending 31
December 2012 will be less than that of the corresponding
previous period by more than 15 percent,” the Melbourne-based
company said today in a statement. OZ Minerals is estimated to
book A$198 million ($207.4 million) in operating profit this
year, based on the average of 11  analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg, which would show a 44 percent decline from 2011.  Copper output will drop to between 90,000 metric tons and
100,000 tons next year from a range of 100,000 tons to 110,000
tons this year. Costs will increase further due to underground
mining and as the company expects to mine harder material at its
open pit mine.  For this year, the company said net income will be within 5
to 10 percent of the consensus estimate of A$156 million. OZ
Minerals is scheduled to report earnings in February.  OZ Minerals shares fell 9.8 percent in Sydney yesterday,
the most in almost four years, on speculation it will miss its
production targets due to issues at its main Prominent Hill mine
in  South Australia . The company denied it has production issues
and reiterated today it will meet its output target range at a
cash cost of between $1.10 and $1.20 a pound.  The  stock  rose 2.4 percent to A$6.87 as of 11:39 a.m. in
Sydney. It has declined 31 percent this year while the benchmark
 stock index  gained 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
