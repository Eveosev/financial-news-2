U.K. 10-year government bonds
advanced, snapping a nine-day decline, as a report showed retail
sales unexpectedly stagnated in November, signaling that the
economic recovery will be uneven.  Gains today pushed yields down from the highest level since
May. The U.K. securities rose with Treasuries as U.S. leaders
struggle to reach an agreement to avert more than $600 billion
in spending cuts and tax increases due to start next month,
threatening to send the world’s largest economy into recession.
Sterling was 0.3 percent from a six-month low against the euro.  “The recovery is going to be a long and drawn-out
process,” said Jason Simpson, an interest-rates strategist at
Banco Santander SA in  London . “A lot of it is offshore driven,
with what’s happening with Treasuries and the bigger picture is
playing a role. The bigger moves have been engineered by what’s
going on globally, with risk appetite.”  Ten-year gilt yields declined one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.94 percent at 11:40 a.m. London time. The
1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 advanced 0.13, or 1.30
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,626) face amount, to 98.31. Yields
rose to 1.99 percent yesterday, the highest since May 10.  Rates on 10-year gilts may climb to 2.90 percent in the
next 12 months, Simpson said.  Sales including fuel were unchanged last month, after
sliding 0.7 percent in October, the  Office for National
Statistics  said in London today. The median prediction of 22
economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.4 percent gain.  Consumer Confidence  U.K. consumer confidence  slipped to minus 25, from minus 22
in November, London-based research group GfK NOP Ltd. will say
tomorrow, according to the median estimate of 21 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  Gilts returned 1.6 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.7 percent and Treasuries earned 1.8 percent.  The U.K. currency was little changed at 81.49 pence per
euro, after depreciating yesterday to 81.68 pence, its weakest
level since June 11. The pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.6276,
after rising to $1.6307 yesterday, the highest since Sept. 21.  Bank of England  policy makers voted 8-1 to pause their
asset-buying program at 375 billion pounds as risks from the
euro-area crisis ease and inflation concerns persist, the
minutes of their Dec. 5-6 meeting released yesterday showed.  The pound has gained 1.6 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 1 percent and the
dollar fell 3.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
