ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ,  Vossloh AG (VOS)  and
Moravia Steel were sued for damages by Deutsche Bahn AG for
fixing the prices for rails.  Deutsche Bahn filed a suit at the Frankfurt Regional Court
after talks over a settlement partly failed, the railway said in
an e-mailed statement today. It didn’t specify the amount it
sought. Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported earlier that Deutsche Bahn
valued that claim at 750 million euros ($992 million) of which
ThyssenKrupp should shoulder 400 million euros.  “In recent months, we appealed to the understanding of the
cartel participants and hoped to reach a settlement,” Deutsche
Bahn said. The talks have failed to yield “an expedient
cooperation.”  Thyssenkrupp, Vossloh and  Voestalpine AG (VOE)  were fined in July
a combined 124.5 million euros by  Germany ’s Federal Cartel
Office for antitrust violations in the country’s railway-steel
market. Under German law, the findings of the regulator are
binding in the civil suit.  ThyssenKrupp hasn’t yet received the complaint, the company
said in an e-mailed statement. It’s still in talks with
Deutsche Bahn over the issue and there was no need to file a
suit, it said. Vossloh declined to comment. Moravia’s German
unit said the company will comment later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
