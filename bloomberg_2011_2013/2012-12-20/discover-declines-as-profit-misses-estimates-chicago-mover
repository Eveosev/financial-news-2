Discover Financial Services (DFS)  Inc.
fell the most on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index (S5FINL) 
after posting fiscal fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’
estimates on higher expenses.  Discover, the sixth-largest U.S. credit-card lender, slid
as much as 5.5 percent in New York, the biggest intraday drop
since June.  Net income  for the three months ended Nov. 30
climbed 7.4 percent to $551 million, or $1.07 a share, from $513
million, or 95 cents, a year earlier, the Riverwoods, Illinois-
based company said today in a statement. The average estimate of
24 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  was $1.13 a share.  Discover is adding staff and increasing marketing costs as
Chief Executive Officer David Nelms seeks to move Discover
beyond its core credit-card operations. Under Nelms, the firm
has become one of the biggest U.S. student lenders and also
started offering mortgages in June.  “When you are investing for organic growth, the expenses
lead to revenues,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Graf said on a
conference call with analysts. “But given the ROIs and the
opportunities we see in these products, we are very comfortable
going ahead and making those investments.”  Discover fell $1.99, or 5 percent, to $37.78 at 12:40 p.m.
The shares had gained 66 percent this year through yesterday,
trailing only Bank of America Corp. among 81 companies in the
financials index.  ‘Too Rich’  Total expenses rose 20 percent to $800 million from a year
earlier, partially driven by higher employee compensation costs,
which climbed 21 percent to $278 million, according to the
statement. The company’s expenses in 2013 will likely be
slightly higher than this year’s $3.05 billion, Graf said on the
call.  Purchases made with Discover cards increased 6 percent to
$26.5 billion from a year earlier, the firm said. Net interest
income climbed 11 percent to $1.39 billion and credit-card loans
rose 6 percent to $49.6 billion, the lender said. Rewards
expenses were higher than the company expected as Discover
offered a 5 percent cash-back promotion in the quarter, Graf
said.  “The program was probably a little bit too rich in
retrospect, but it did drive fabulous cardmember engagement,
which is great,” Graf said.  The firm raised its quarterly dividend 40 percent to 14
cents a share, payable on Jan. 17. Discover plans to be “more
aggressive” in asking the  Federal Reserve  for approval to
return capital to shareholders in 2013, Graf said.  Soured Loans  Write-offs of loans deemed uncollectible fell to 2.02
percent in November from 3.04 percent a year earlier. Loans at
least 30 days overdue, a signal of future defaults, dropped to
1.84 percent from 2.43 percent. Only New York-based  American
Express Co. (AXP)  posted lower rates among the six biggest U.S.
credit-card issuers.  Net interest margin, the difference between what a firm
pays in deposits and charges for loans, rose to 9.44 percent
from 9.1 percent a year earlier on lower funding costs. Graf
said while the margin may decline next year as yield on assets
declines, it’s likely to stay above the firm’s long-term target
of 8.5 percent to 9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
