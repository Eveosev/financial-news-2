OAO Gazprom led a rally in Russian
stocks traded in the U.S., and  RTS  Index equity futures gained,
after President  Vladimir Putin  pledged to cut taxes and lure
investment back to the world’s biggest energy exporter.  American depositary receipts of Gazprom,  Russia ’s biggest
company, climbed the most in three months in  New York , driving a
0.9 percent advance in the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index  of
the most-traded Russian stocks in the U.S. ADRs of OAO Lukoil
rebounded from their cheapest level relative to emerging-market
energy producers in a month. Futures expiring in March on the
RTS added 0.5 percent to 153,670 during U.S. hours.  Putin, speaking at a more than four-hour press conference
in Moscow yesterday, said the government will seek to lower
Russia’s tax burden, better safeguard the interests of business
owners and undertake measures to bring about the “de-
offshorization” of the economy. Moscow’s benchmark Micex Index 
trades at an average multiple of 5.5 times estimated earnings, 
the lowest valuation among 21  emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg.  “Those were the right signals and the market takes it as a
stimulus for growth,” Ivan Manaenko, the head of research at
Veles Capital LLC in Moscow, said in a phone interview
yesterday. “Lower taxes and higher investment, this is exactly
what is needed. Those are the right words, the question is what
kind of actions will follow.”  Capital Repatriation  Putin, who returned to the Kremlin in March after four
years as prime minister, is driving a bid to repatriate $1
trillion of capital back to Russia. The Economy Ministry has
estimated net capital outflow could total $75 billion in 2012,
after doubling to $80.5 billion last year.  Volumes  on the Micex
are about a third the level of  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index, which has
a an average valuation of 17.9 times estimated earnings, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  rose to 98.72
yesterday, the highest level since Oct. 22. The Market Vectors
Russia ETF, the largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund,
added 1.2 percent to $29.97, the highest close since Sept. 18.
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
futures, fell 0.3 percent to 20.51.  Putin said Dec. 12 that the country should proceed with
anti-corruption legislation that would put limits on bureaucrats
and lawmakers, including the president and prime minister,
owning foreign bank deposits and securities. Russia kept its
ranking as the world’s most corrupt major economy  this year,
according to a Transparency International’s Corruption
Perceptions Index. Russian capital outflow in 2012 is seen at
between $65 billion and $67 billion, Central Bank Chairman
 Sergei Ignatiev  told reporters in Moscow on Dec. 19.  Gazprom Gains  Gazprom advanced 3.7 percent to $9.35 in New York
yesterday, rising to the highest level since Oct. 26. The ADRs
settled at a 0.8 percent premium to the company’s Moscow-listed
shares, the biggest gap since Sept. 27. The  stock  increased 1.6
percent in Moscow to 142.38 rubles, or the equivalent of $4.64.  Lukoil, Russia’s second-biggest producer after OAO
Rosneft, rose 3.3 percent to $66.89 in New York yesterday, the
highest level since Aug. 1. The stock recovered from the
cheapest level versus peers on the MSCI Emerging Markets Energy
Index since Nov. 14. The Moscow based company said billionaire
owners Vagit Alekperov and  Leonid Fedun  bought about $260
million in stock. The  stock  gained 1.4 percent to 2,037.3
rubles, or the equivalent of $66.39, the highest level since
April 2011.  Oil Advances  OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, increased 0.3
percent to $12.29, with trading volumes almost three times the
daily average over the past three months, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The lender said in a regulatory filing yesterday
it expects net income will reach as much as 390 billion rubles
($12.7 billion) in 2013. The Moscow-based bank’s stock was
little changed at 94.51 rubles, or $3.08.  Oil advanced for a fifth day in New York, the longest
stretch of gains since September. Crude oil for February
delivery rose 0.2 percent to $90.13 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since Oct. 18. Brent
oil for February settlement fell 0.1 percent to $110.20 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Urals crude ,
the country’s main export blend, climbed 0.1 percent to $109.56
a barrel yesterday.  Futures expiring in March on the ruble showed the currency
weakening 0.1 percent to 31.116 per dollar after climbing for a
third day in Moscow yesterday, for a gain of 0.2 percent to
30.6625.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 0.4 percent to HK$4.91 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:46
