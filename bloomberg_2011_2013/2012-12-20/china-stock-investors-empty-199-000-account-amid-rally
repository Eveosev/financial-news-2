The biggest two-week rally in the
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  in 13 months failed to draw Chinese
stock investors, who emptied accounts at the second-fastest pace
in 17 months last week.  The number of stock  accounts  containing funds dropped by
about 199,000 to 55.35 million in the week to Dec. 14, the
lowest level since the week to Nov. 19, 2010, regulatory data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Some 1.5 million accounts have been
emptied this year, leaving a record 112 million without funds.  The benchmark index jumped 8.6 percent in the two weeks
through Dec. 14 after the government signaled it will boost
spending on  urban development  and amid speculation state-backed
institutions were buying shares. The gauge is heading for a
third straight year of losses and is down 65 percent from its
October 2007 peak. The index dropped 0.2 percent to 2,158.51 at
11:02 a.m. today.  “Retail confidence is still not very strong,” said
Terrace Chum, Hong Kong-based fund manager at Manulife Asset
Management, which oversees $220 billion. “People got burnt over
the last few years. You need a more sustainable uptrend, then
the retail investors will come back.”  The number of stock-trading accounts that made  transactions 
in A shares last week increased to 8.6 million from 7.3 million
the previous week, the highest level since the week to Sept. 14
and in line with the 12-month average of 8.6 million. Investors
opened 101,743 accounts to trade stocks, the most since the week
to Sept. 28.  Urban Development  Industrial and materials producers have been among the
biggest gainers in Chinese stocks since Dec. 4, when the
official Xinhua News Agency cited the nation’s new leaders as
saying they would promote urban development. The two  industry
gauges  in the  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  have risen at least 9.7 percent.  “Urbanization is a historic task with the country’s
modernization drive, and a main driver to boost domestic
consumption,” the  China Daily  reported Dec. 17, citing an
official statement from an annual economic conference, which
sets the tone for economic policies the following year.  Shares have also been lifted by signs the government will
allow more overseas funds to enter the market.  China  may relax
or abolish a rule that requires  Renminbi  Qualified Foreign
Institutional Investors to keep most of their funds in bonds,
the  Hong Kong  Monetary Authority said last week.  Valuations Slump  China removed a $1 billion ceiling on investments by
overseas sovereign wealth funds and central banks in its  capital
markets , acccording to revised regulations posted Dec. 14 on the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange’s website. The
regulator kept the overall quota for qualified foreign
institutional investors at $80 billion. Approved quotas for QFII
funds total $36.04 billion, or less than 2 percent of stock-
market value.  The Shanghai Composite slumped to an almost four-year low
on Dec. 3, when  valuations  slid to a record low of 10.8 times
reported earnings. Shares now trade at a multiple of 11.9, the
highest in five months.  The  value  of shares traded on the Shanghai exchange has
fallen for the past three days after jumping on Dec. 14 to 111
billion yuan ($17.8 billion), the highest since May 2. That’s up
from a four-year low of 33.1 billion  yuan  on Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
