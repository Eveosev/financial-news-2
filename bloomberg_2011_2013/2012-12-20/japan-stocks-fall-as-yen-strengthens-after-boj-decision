Japan’s  shares  fell, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average falling from an eight-month high, as the yen
strengthened even after the Bank of Japan expanded its asset-
purchase program.  Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, sank 2.9
percent to 3,355 yen. Capcom Co. plunged 12 percent after the
gamemaker cut its profit forecast and delayed the release of a
new title.  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)  sank 5.5 percent after the
transport ministry warned the automaker for being “passive”
after a fourth round of recalls. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., Japan’s biggest lender, led banks higher on optimism the
nation’s new leadership will push for reflation.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.2 percent to 10,039.33 at the close
in  Tokyo  after after reaching its highest level since March 28
yesterday and topping 10,000 for the first time since April.
Volume on the gauge was 90 percent higher than the 30-day
average. The broader Topix Index slid 0.1 percent to 838.61
after rising as much as 0.8 percent.  “The results from the Bank of Japan meeting were as
expected,” said Eisuke Shigemura, head of equities at Tokio
Marine & Nichido Life Insurance Co., which oversees about $47
billion in Tokyo. “There is a sense of overheating on Japanese
stocks so we’re seeing a break after some big gains.”  The Nikkei 225’s 14-day relative strength index was at
78.46 today, trading above the 70 level for a seventh day. Some
traders interpret a reading above 70 as an indication the market
is overbought.  BOJ Decision  The Topix earlier reversed declines after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
expanded its asset-purchase program for the third time in four
months, and said it will reconsider its 1 percent inflation goal
as incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urges a doubling of the
target to end price declines.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures were little changed
today. The gauge slid 0.8 percent yesterday as deteriorating
 federal budget  negotiations fueled concern that $600 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts will be triggered if a
compromise is not reached by the end of the year.  White House Communications Director  Dan Pfeiffer  said
President  Barack Obama  would veto a Republican tax-and-spending
proposal because it would put “too big a burden on the middle
class.” House Speaker  John Boehner ’s plan would raise taxes on
income over $1 million rather than the $400,000 threshold the
president proposed. Lawmakers may vote today on Boehner’s plan.  Japanese exporters declined, with transport and electronic
makers the biggest drags among the Topix’s 33 industry groups.  Canon fell 2.9 percent to 3,355 yen. Honda Motor Co., an
automaker that counts  North America  as its biggest market, slid
1.8 percent to 3,015 yen. Nissan Motor Co. tumbled 7.4 percent
to 782 yen. Nomura Holdings Inc. also reduced Nissan’s
investment rating on concerns the company may miss its profit
target on higher costs and slower sales.  Yen Climbs  The yen gained against all of its major peers today. The
currency rose 0.5 percent to 84 against the dollar and 0.6
percent to 111.02 to the euro. A stronger yen hurts overseas
earnings for Japanese exporters when repatriated.  Among other stocks that fell today, Capcom tumbled 12
percent to 1,300 yen. The video-game company reduced its
operating-profit target by 37 percent to 10 billion yen, citing
weakening sales of “Resident Evil 6” and pushing the release
of “Monster Hunter 4” into next year. The stock was downgraded
to equalweight from overweight at Barclays Plc.  Mitsubishi Motors dropped 5.5 percent to 86 yen, the third-
biggest decline on the Nikkei 225. The transport ministry said
the automaker made “inappropriate decisions” in regards to a
series of recalls tied to an oil leak. The company said it will
call back eight models, including the Town Box and the Minica
minicar, for a total of 1.21 million vehicles in  Japan .  Banks Advance  Among stocks that gained, Mitsubishi UFJ rose, leading
 banks higher . Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s
third largest lender, rose 0.8 percent to 3,035 yen.  “Banks are rising because of market expectations for
pressure on the BOJ to continue easing and the new government’s
efforts to reflate the economy, which will benefit lenders,”
said Hidehiro Tomioka, who helps oversee $1.2 billion at
Manulife Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. in Tokyo.  The Topix trades at 0.99 times book value, compared with
2.1 for the S&P 500 and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than the value of their assets.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index climbed 1.5
percent to 19.08, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.4
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
