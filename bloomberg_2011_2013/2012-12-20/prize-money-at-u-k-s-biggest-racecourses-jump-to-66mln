Prize money at Britain’s biggest
racecourses, such as Aintree and Epsom Downs, will jump 15
percent to 40.4 million pounds ($66 million) next year, the
 Jockey Club  said.  “We’re being more commercially successful, driving our
profits and so we were able to put more back into prize money,”
Jockey Club Group Chief Executive Officer Simon Bazalgette said
in an interview. Prize money in 2013 is also set to rise because
of a higher horseracing betting levy from bookmakers, he added.  The Jockey Club, which manages and operates 15 racecourses
including Cheltenham and Newmarket’s Rowley Mile and July
courses, will contribute a record 18.6 million pounds to the
prize money pot, compared with 16.8 million pounds in 2012.  Funding from the betting levy -- the annual fee on the
profits of bookmakers from bets on British horseracing -- will
contribute 15.1 million pounds, up from 11.7 million. The rest
is made up of owners’ entry fees for races, the  Jockey Club 
said.  Prize money will be spread across 361 fixtures. Average
prize money per fixture will rise 6.3 percent to 110,000 pounds.  The group will announce its 2012 financial results in
April.  Cheltenham Boost  Cheltenham Racecourse , home to the annual jump-racing
festival in March, will boost prize money by about 12 percent to
a record 6.12 million pounds, it said in an e-mailed statement
today. The payout on Gold Cup day, its showcase event, is set to
exceed 1 million pounds for the first time next year, it said.  “I am delighted that we are able to reward further the
investment made by owners in horses that compete at the pinnacle
of jump racing,” said Simon Claisse, regional head of racing
and clerk of the course at Cheltenham. “Increased prize money
is also a significant boost for the jockeys, the trainers and
the stable staff involved with horses that run at Cheltenham.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
