China ’s money-market rate surged the
most in three weeks on speculation cash supply will decline as
banks hoard funds to meet year-end  capital requirements  and
holiday withdrawals.  The People’s Bank of China added 33 billion  yuan  ($5.3
billion) to the financial system via 14-day reverse repurchase
contracts at a  yield  of 3.45 percent, the same as at the last
sale on Dec. 13, according to a trader required to bid at the
auctions. It injected an additional 60 billion yuan for seven
days at 3.35 percent, also unchanged, the trader said. China’s
financial markets will remain shut from Jan. 1 through Jan. 3.  “As the year-end and the holiday draw near, banks are
trying to meet regulatory and their own capital requirements,”
said Song Qiuhong, a bond trader at Foshan Shunde Rural
Commercial Bank Co. in Foshan, a city in the southern  Guangdong
province . “The market is going to be more volatile next week.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, jumped 40 basis points to 3.45 percent as
of 10:54 a.m. in Shanghai, the biggest increase since Nov. 28,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost needed to receive
the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose two basis points to
3.37 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.94 percent government bond due October
2013 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.87
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
