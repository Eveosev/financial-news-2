The global cotton surplus will be
1.8 percent smaller than forecast in November because of reduced
output in the U.S. and demand from India and  Brazil , said
Cotlook Ltd., the publisher of a benchmark price index.  Production in the year that began Aug. 1 will exceed
consumption by 3.617 million metric tons, down from the 3.683
million predicted last month and the year-earlier surplus of a
revised 5.488 million, Birkenhead, U.K.-based Cotlook said today
in a statement.  The research company cut its output estimate by 0.1 percent
to 25.8782 million tons, including a 1.1 percent reduction for
the U.S., the world’s largest exporter, where production will be
3.758 million tons. Revisions to the U.S. and unspecified other
countries were partially offset by bigger estimates for Africa.  Consumption was estimated at 22.255 million tons, up 0.2
percent from last month, including a jump to 7.775 million tons
by countries in the  Indian subcontinent .  China , the world’s top
consumer in the 2011-2012 season at 7.8 million tons, will see
demand slip this year to 7.7 million, the researcher said.  This year, prices on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  have
dropped 18 percent as global inventories expanded and economic
growth slowed. Today, cotton futures for December delivery fell
0.1 percent to 75.83 cents a pound as of 2:30 p.m. on ICE.  Cotlook , which has published cotton news for 85 years,
issues the Cotlook A  Index , which reflects offer prices for
