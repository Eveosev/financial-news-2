Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy
Louisiana Sweet oils from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico lost value on
the  spot market  as the margin between  Brent crude  and West Texas
Intermediate narrowed.  WTI’s discount to Brent shrank by 31 cents to $20.07 a
barrel, based on February settlement prices. When Brent  loses
ground to WTI , it typically weakens the value of U.S. grades
that compete with foreign oils priced versus Europe’s benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed $2.25 to
$19.50 a barrel at 4:14 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The premium for Heavy Louisiana Sweet
shrank $1.80 to $18.50.  The premium to WTI for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower
sulfur content than Mars Blend, Poseidon and Southern Green
Canyon, narrowed by $1.50 to $16.75.  Mars’s premium to the U.S. benchmark narrowed by $1.10 to
trade at $14.50. Poseidon narrowed 80 cents to $14.75 above the
WTI price. Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $15
above the benchmark.  The discount for Western Canada Select for February
delivery versus WTI was unchanged at $34.65 a barrel at 5:45
p.m. in  New York , according to Net Energy Inc., a Calgary-based
oil broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
