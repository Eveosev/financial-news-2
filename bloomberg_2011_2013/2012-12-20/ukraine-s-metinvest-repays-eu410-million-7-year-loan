Metinvest, Ukraine’s biggest
steelmaker, repaid ahead of schedule the remaining 107.5 million
euros ($142.3 million) of a seven-year, 410 million-euro loan.  The loan was given to Metinvest in January of 2008 by a
syndicate of 10 banks to purchase plate-rolling facilities in
 Italy  and the U.K., the company said in a statement published on
its website late yesterday. ABN Amro Bank NV and  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) 
managed the loan, according to the website.  “Repayment of the facility decreases our short-term
financial obligations and total indebtedness ” and lowers “the
share of senior secured debt, improving the credit rating of
Metinvest’s public debt instruments,” Metinvest Chief Financial
Officer Sergiy Novikov said in the statement.  The Donetsk, Ukraine-based steelmaker, controlled by
billionaire  Rinat Akhmetov , envisages capital expenditure of as
much as $800 million next year and plans no big borrowing in
2013, Novikov said in a Nov. 1 interview. The company expects
its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization to drop this year of declining steel sales.  Early repayment of the loan is part of Metinvest’s
optimization of debt structure, the company said. It was repaid
from the cash accumulated by Metinvest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
