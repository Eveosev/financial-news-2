A/S  Schouw & Co (SCHO) , which owns 4
million shares in Vestas Wind Systems A/S, rose to its highest
in 18 months in Copenhagen trading after Nordea Equity Research
said it expects bigger dividends and share buy-back programs.  Schouw rose as much as 1.1 percent to 144.5 kroner, the
highest since June 1 last year. The stock also traded at that
price at 9:49 a.m. in the Danish capital with trading volume at
45 percent of the three-month daily average.  Schouw shares rose 6.3 percent yesterday after the Aarhus,
Denmark-based company said it agreed to sell its lighting and
smoke machine maker Martin Professional for 110 million euros
($145 million). Nordea today raised its  recommendation  on the
shares to strong buy from buy, saying the divestment price
exceeded the bank’s estimates and was “far from” reflected in
yesterday’s share gain.  “Net interest bearing debt will come down sharply in 2013,
which increases the likelihood of share buybacks on top of
dividend payments,” Dan Kirk Wejse, an analyst with Nordea in
Copenhagen, said in a note. He raised his price estimate on the
stock to 180 kroner from 165 kroner.  Schouw, which also owns a fish feed unit, paid an annual
 dividend  of 4 kroner a share in April, up from 3 kroner a year
earlier. The company’s net interest bearing debt was 2.67
billion kroner ($473 million) at the end of September, down from
2.86 billion kroner a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
