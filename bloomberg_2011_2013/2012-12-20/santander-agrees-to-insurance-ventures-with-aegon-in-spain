Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  Aegon NV (AGN) 
agreed to create two insurance joint ventures in Spain,
generating a 410 million-euro ($542 million) pretax gain for the
Spanish lender.  Santander, Spain’s biggest bank, will create life-insurance
and non-life units in which Aegon will take 51 percent stakes,
the Spanish lender said in a filing to regulators in Madrid
today. Aegon will pay 220 million euros and may make an
additional payment after five years, depending on performance,
the Dutch insurer said.  The pretax gain is based on the valuation of the whole
company and will be used to bolster Santander’s balance sheet as
Spanish lenders seek to shore up capital levels amid rising loan
defaults.  Under the 25-year deal, Santander will market the insurance
products through its branch network in  Spain . The transaction is
expected to be completed in the first half of next year, after
regulatory authorization, Santander said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
