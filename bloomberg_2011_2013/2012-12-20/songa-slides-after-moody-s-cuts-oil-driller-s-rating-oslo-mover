Songa Offshore SE (SONG) , a Cyprus-based
offshore driller, fell the most in more than a month in Oslo as
Moody’s Investors Service cut its rating on the company, citing
operational setbacks and a risk of covenant breaches.  Songa dropped as much as  15 percent , the most since Nov.
15, and traded 7.1 percent weaker at 7.80 kroner as of 2:45 p.m.
in the Norwegian capital. That extends the stock’s decline in
the last 12 months to 54 percent, and gives the company a market
value of 1.6 billion kroner ($288 million).  Moody’s downgraded Songa’s corporate family and probability
of default rating to B3 from B2, citing operational problems,
longer yard stays for some of its vessels and “weak covenant
headroom,” the ratings company said in a statement. The cut
“also considers the weak operational track record and recent
departure of the CEO, combined with uncertainty” about the
Limassol-based company’s strategic management, Moody’s said.  Songa, with five rigs and four on order, has struggled with
higher-than-anticipated spending as it expands to meet rising
demand from oil and gas producers. Its board on Oct. 24 said it
began an assessment of strategic and operational issues after
announcing that Chief Executive Officer Asbjoern Vavik had quit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
