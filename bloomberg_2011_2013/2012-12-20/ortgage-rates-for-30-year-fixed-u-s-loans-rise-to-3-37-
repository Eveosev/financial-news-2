U.S. 30-year  mortgage rates  rose,
increasing long-term borrowing costs as home values extend a
recovery from a six-year slump.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.37
percent in the week ended today, up from 3.32 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac  said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate slipped to 2.65 percent from 2.66 percent.  Interest rates  close to record lows are attracting buyers,
while a shrinking supply of properties for sale bolsters prices.
U.S. home values jumped about 6 percent this year, the first
increase since 2006, according to Zillow Inc. Gains will
probably continue in 2013, the Seattle-based home-listing
service said today.  Permits to build new homes rose to a four-year high last
month, the Commerce Department said yesterday.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent in November, according to Freddie Mac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
