Heating oil futures gained in  New
York  amid forecasts of colder-than-normal weather as inventories
remain below the 10-year average.  January-delivery heating oil rose as much as 0.6 percent as
the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s 8-14
day forecast showed warmer-than-normal weather dropping back to
normal in parts of the Northeast. U.S. distillate inventories
fell 1.09 million barrels to 111.7 million, 14 percent below the
10-year seasonal average, Energy Department data show. Heating
oil supplies sank 1.6 million barrels.  “Looking at yesterday’s report, there was a draw of
heating oil by more than a million barrels, which leaves us
very, very tight on heating oil inventory as we head into the
winter,”  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies
Bache LLC in New York, said in a phone interview. “With the
combination of low inventories and the prospect of demand
increases from colder weather, an upward movement in price is
expected.”  Heating oil for January delivery rose 1.92 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.0548 a gallon at 12:06 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Gasoline for January delivery rose 0.93 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.7524 a gallon on the Nymex.  The average nationwide cost for  regular gasoline  sank 0.7
cent to a $3.219 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. That’s
the 28th-straight-day of falling prices, and the lowest level
since Dec. 21, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
