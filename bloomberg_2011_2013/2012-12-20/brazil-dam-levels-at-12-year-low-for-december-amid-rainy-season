Dams in  Brazil ’s most populated area
are at the lowest December levels since 2000 as the rainy season
fails to bring enough water to recover from months of dryness.  Reservoir levels in December in the southeastern and
center-western regions, the country’s most populated, reached an
average 30 percent of capacity through yesterday, according to
 data published  by the power grid operator, known as ONS. In
2000, the region’s reservoirs were 28 percent on average in
December, according to ONS.  The rainy season runs from October to March, with December
and January the wettest months traditionally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
