Winnebago Industries Inc. (WGO) , a maker
of motor homes, climbed to its highest price in almost two years
after reporting quarterly financial results that exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  Shares gained 16 percent to $16.33 in New York, the highest
closing price since February 2011. It was the biggest one-day
increase since March 15.  The company, based in Forest City,  Iowa , reported that net
income for the first quarter of its 2013 fiscal year totaled
$7.4 million, or 26 cents a share, from $1 million, or 4 cents,
a year earlier. The average estimate of four analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was for a per-share profit of 10 cents. Revenue for
the 14-week quarter ended Nov. 26 increased to $193.6 million
compared with $131.8 million for the year-earlier 13-week
quarter.  Besides the additional week, Winnebago had increased
production during the quarter “due to robust demand,”
according to a statement on the company’s website. Sales of
recreational vehicles are monitored as a sign of an improving
economy because motor homes and travel trailers are
discretionary purchases that consumers defer during a slump.  Winnebago shares have more than doubled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
