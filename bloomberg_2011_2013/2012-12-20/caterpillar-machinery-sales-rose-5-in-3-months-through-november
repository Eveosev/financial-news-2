Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s
largest maker of construction and mining equipment, said global
machine sales rose at a slower pace in the three months through
November as North American growth decelerated.  Machines sales reported by dealers globally rose 5 percent
from a year ago in the three months through November, down from
8 percent growth reported for the three months through October,
the Peoria, Illinois-based company said today in a filing. Sales
in North America, Caterpillar’s biggest market, increased 3
percent, down from a 13 percent increase reported a month
earlier, according to the filing.  “North America has decelerated somewhat into the end of
the year due to economic uncertainty and political
uncertainty,” Larry De Maria, a New York-based analyst for
William Blair & Co., said today in an interview.  Once leaders in  Washington  resolve the debate over tax
increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff, “the
increases should become more meaningful and the replacement
cycle should resume,” said De Maria, who has a buy rating on
Caterpillar.  U.S. sales have risen during the past year as builders and
contractors replaced aging machines. Caterpillar Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  Doug Oberhelman  on Dec. 6 said he
expects President  Barack Obama  and Congressional leaders to
negotiate a deal. Assuming they avoid the fiscal cliff, the U.S.
looks “pretty good in 2013,” he said.  Caterpillar fell 0.9 percent to $89.50 at the close in New
York. The shares have declined 1.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
