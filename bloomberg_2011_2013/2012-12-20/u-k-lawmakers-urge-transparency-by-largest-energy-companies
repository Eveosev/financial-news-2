The U.K.’s six largest energy
companies should be ordered to publish the amount of electricity
they buy and sell to themselves to improve transparency and
build consumer trust, lawmakers said.  Allegations of price fixing last month, currently being
investigated by the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets,
underline the need for action, the House of Commons Energy and
Climate Change Committee said in a report published in London
today.  “Even before the recent reports of wholesale price-fixing,
we were extremely concerned about the lack of transparency
around wholesale prices and suppliers’ trading arrangements,”
the committee chairman, Conservative lawmaker  Tim Yeo , said in
an e-mailed statement. “Ofgem must get its act together. It
should require greater transparency around wholesale prices,
trading and the link between wholesale prices and supply
prices.”  The committee will carry out a further investigation into
energy companies’ profits and pricing, which will look at ways
that Ofgem can enforce greater transparency, Yeo said. Ofgem is
also criticised in the report for being reluctant to investigate
anti-competitive behavior.  In the wake of the Libor-fixing scandal that led to a
record fine for Barclays Plc, trading in the U.K.’s $480 billion
gas market came under the spotlight in November after a
journalist at the ICIS price agency reported deals he suspected
were being done below “prevailing” levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
