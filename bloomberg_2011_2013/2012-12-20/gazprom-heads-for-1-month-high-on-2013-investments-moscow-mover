OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s natural-gas
export monopoly, jumped to a one-month high as its board
approved a smaller investment program for 2013 than this year.  Gazprom rose as much as 1.8 percent before closing up 1.6
percent at 142.38 rubles by the close in Moscow, the highest
level since Nov. 21. The amount of shares traded was 53 million,
equivalent to 1.6 times the three-month average.  The board approved next year’s investments at 705.4 billion
rubles ($22.9 billion), Gazprom said in an e-mailed statement.
That compares with 975 billion rubles for 2012. The board set
capital expenditure at 658 billion rubles.  “It is positive news because the main thing investors
criticized Gazprom for was high spending,” Sergey Vakhrameev,
an analyst at IFC Metropol in Moscow, said by phone today.
“Gazprom now met investors halfway and cut investments.”  Investors would like to see Gazprom increasing its free
 cash flow ,  Alexei Kokin , an analyst at UralSib Capital, said by
phone.  Gazprom’s board passed a 25 percent increase in the 2012
investment program in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
