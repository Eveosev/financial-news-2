The European Union set four tenders
to import sugar at a reduced duty to ease shortages and
authorized local producers to export more supplies they don’t
have permission to sell domestically.  The tenders to ship in as much as 600,000 metric tons of
raw or white sugar will start next month, with the first likely
date being Jan. 23,  Roger Waite , a spokesman for the European
Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said today by e-mail. Local
producers will be allowed to export an additional 700,000 tons
of the sweetener they can’t sell in the domestic market, taking
total shipment permits for the 2012-13 season to 1.35 million
tons, within the limit imposed by the  World Trade Organization .  Under EU rules, producers can only sell a limited amount of
their output within the local market. The rest has to be put to
non-food use or exported within the WTO limits. That leaves the
bloc’s consumption to be met by imports from some countries that
have preferential agreements with the 27-member states. Imports
from these nations have been falling short of demand, prompting
the commission to organize import tenders.  A proposal to allow local producers to sell more sugar
within the bloc was discussed at today’s meeting of the Sugar
Management Committee and will be voted on in January, the
commission said. The EU also suspended additional duties imposed
on top of the levy of 419 euros ($555) a ton for imports of
white sugar and 339 euros a ton for the raw variety, Waite said.  EU sugar production will fall 6.1 percent to 17.6 million
tons in the 2012-13 season started Oct. 1, according to new
estimates by the commission released today. Sugar stockpiles in
the bloc were 1.6 million tons at the end of last season, down
from a previous forecast of 2 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
