South African police and Interpol
are probing allegations of corruption related to soccer games
played by the national team before the 2010  World Cup  after the
sport’s governing body found “compelling  evidence ” of match-
fixing.  The investigation started two days ago, Paul Ramaloko,
spokesman for South African police’s Hawks investigative unit,
said by phone today. He declined to say who was the target of
the investigation and what crimes were being investigated.  The South African Football Association asked its president,
Kirsten Nematandani, to take a voluntary leave of absence while
it probes allegations of match-fixing before the tournament,
which  South Africa  hosted, the association said on its website
on Dec. 17. Four other officials at the national group were
suspended.  FIFA, the world governing body of the sport, gave evidence
of match-fixing in a  report , according to SAFA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
