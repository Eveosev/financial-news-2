Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. has
submitted a bid to buy Manganese Bronze Holdings Plc, the maker
of London’s black cabs that’s under creditor protection, two
people familiar with the matter said.  Zhejiang Geely, which owns Swedish automaker Volvo Cars, is
offering to buy 80.03 percent of Manganese Bronze, one of the
people said, declining to say how much the company is offering
for the stake. Both people asked not to be named because the
talks are private.  A purchase of the cab maker will help Zhejiang Geely, the
closely held automaker headed by  Li Shufu , speed up its overseas
expansion. Manganese Bronze, which has made taxis in Coventry,
England since 1948, is fighting for survival after going into
administration -- a form of creditor protection -- on Oct. 30
after the tie-up with  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175)  failed to
yield savings.  Geely Auto, the Hong Kong-traded unit of Zhejiang Geely,
owns 19.97 percent in the cab maker. The listed unit isn’t
involved in the bid, one of the people said.  A Zhejiang Geely spokesman declined to comment on whether
the company is making the bid. A London-based spokeswoman for
Manganese Bronze’s administrator, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLC, couldn’t immediately comment on the bid.  Geely Auto and Manganese Bronze entered a cab-making joint
venture in 2006 in  Shanghai  to reduce costs of producing the
iconic taxis. Under the deal, the British manufacturer bought
components and body parts from Geely before assembling them in
the U.K. Geely in return can sell the cabs in  China  and parts of
 Asia .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
