Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.18 percent, within the Federal
Reserve’s target range of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.17 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.13 percent to 0.18 percent and averaging 0.16 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The Fed will hold two separate operations as part of its
plan to replace short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-
term Treasuries to reduce borrowing costs further and counter
rising risks of a recession.  Beginning at 10:15 a.m. New York time, the central bank
will buy $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion Treasuries due from
February 2023 to February 2031. Starting at 1:15 p.m. and ending
at 2 p.m., the Fed will sell $7 billion to $8 billion of
Treasuries maturing from December 2015 to January 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
