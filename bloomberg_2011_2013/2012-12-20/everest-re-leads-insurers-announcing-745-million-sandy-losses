Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE)  led insurers
that announced more than $700 million in potential losses today
from superstorm Sandy, which lashed the U.S. East Coast and
flooded portions of New York and New Jersey.  Everest Re’s losses from the storm may be $220 million
after taxes, the Bermuda-based insurer said today in a
statement.  Aspen Insurance Holdings Ltd. (AHL) , also based in  Bermuda ,
said losses from Sandy may be $175 million by the same measure.  Sandy battered the U.S. Northeast, flooding homes and
shuttering businesses, after making landfall in New Jersey in
October. It may cost the insurance industry as much as $25
billion, catastrophe modeler Risk Management Solutions Inc. has
said.  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , the insurer that repaid
a U.S. bailout, said Sandy will cost about $1.3 billion after
taxes, the highest sum disclosed by a U.S. insurer.  “ Hurricane Sandy  passed with devastating effects,”
analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. including Arun Kumar wrote in a
Dec. 4 research note. “The devastation was wide and the scale
of the insured losses is expected to be high.”  RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR)  said Sandy losses may reduce
fourth-quarter earnings by about $130 million. Allied World
Assurance Co. Holdings AG said Sandy losses are about $165
million before taxes. At  Argo Group International Holdings Ltd. (AGII) ,
Sandy may cost $45 million to $55 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
