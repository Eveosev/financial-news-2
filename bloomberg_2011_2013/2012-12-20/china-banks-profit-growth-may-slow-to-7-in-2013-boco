Chinese banks ’ profit growth may
slow to between 7 and 8 percent in 2013 from an estimated 17
percent increase this year, as non-performing loans climb amid a
slowing economy and more borrowers resort to bond financing,
according to Bank of Communications Co.  Banks may extend 9 trillion  yuan  ($1.4 trillion) of  new
loans  next year, compared with a forecast of 8.4 to 8.5 trillion
yuan this year, the Shanghai-based Bank of Communications, the
nation’s fifth largest, said in a research note yesterday.
Aggregate social financing, which includes loans, bond and
equity offerings as well as trusts, may be between 16.5 and 17.5
trillion yuan, according to the note.  China  will “properly expand” aggregate financing and
maintain a “moderate increase” in lending next year as policy
makers seek a higher “quality and efficiency” of growth, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported after the annual central
economic work conference that ended on Dec. 16.  The government has set its initial target for  economic
growth  at 7.5 percent for a second year and tightened its
inflation goal to about 3.5 percent, the lowest level since
2010, people briefed on the matter said this week. The
government didn’t set targets for money supply or new loans at
the meeting, the people said.  Bad loans at domestic banks may increase by 70 to 90
billion yuan next year while their net interest margin, a
measure of lending profitability, will narrow about 15 basis
points, according to Bank of Communications.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
