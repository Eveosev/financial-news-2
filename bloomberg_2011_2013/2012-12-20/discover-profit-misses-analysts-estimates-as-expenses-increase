Discover Financial Services (DFS)  Inc.,
the sixth-biggest U.S. credit-card lender, posted a fiscal
fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates as
increased expenses outpaced revenue growth.  Net income  for the three months ended Nov. 30 climbed 7.4
percent to $551 million, or $1.07 a share, from $513 million, or
95 cents, a year earlier, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based company
said today in a statement. The average estimate of 24 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News was $1.13 a share.  Discover is adding staff and increasing marketing costs as
Chief Executive Officer David Nelms seeks to move Discover
beyond its core credit-card operations. Under Nelms, the firm
has become one of the biggest U.S. student lenders and also
started offering mortgages in June.  “Our strategy and business model are working as we
achieved organic growth in all of our lending products,” Nelms,
51, said in the statement.  Total expenses rose 20 percent to $800 million from a year
earlier, partially driven by higher employee compensation costs,
which climbed 21 percent to $278 million. The firm raised its
quarterly dividend 40 percent to 14 cents a share.  Write-offs of loans deemed uncollectible fell to 2.02
percent in November from 3.04 percent a year earlier. Loans at
least 30 days overdue, a signal of future defaults, dropped to
1.84 percent from 2.43 percent. Only New York-based  American
Express Co. (AXP)  posted lower rates among the six biggest U.S.
credit-card issuers.  Purchases Increase  Discover slipped 1.9 percent to $39.01 at 9:05 a.m. in New
York trading. The shares gained 66 percent this year through
yesterday, the second-biggest advance after Bank of America
Corp. among 81 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials
Index.  Purchases made with Discover cards increased 6 percent to
$26.5 billion from a year earlier, the firm said. Net interest
income climbed 11 percent to $1.39 billion and credit-card loans
rose 6 percent to $49.6 billion, the lender said.  Net interest margin, the difference between what a firm
pays in deposits and charges for loans, rose to 9.44 percent
from 9.1 percent a year earlier on lower funding costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
