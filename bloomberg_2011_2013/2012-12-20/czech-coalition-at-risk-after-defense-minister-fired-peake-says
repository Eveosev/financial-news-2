Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas’s
governing coalition risks collapsing after his deputy Karolina Peake was fired as defense minister eight days into the job, she
said today.  “This is the factual end of the government,” Peake said
in comments broadcast on state-run Czech Television. Her LIDEM
party’s five lawmakers provide vital support to the government
in the 200-seat parliament, where Necas is struggling to muster
a ruling majority.  Peake, 37, removed a group of top officials from the
Defense Ministry last week after taking office, even though she
had publicly pledged not to make any major personnel changes.
The move was criticized by Necas and President Vaclav Klaus, who
removed her from the post today after being asked to do so by
the prime minister.  “If some men thought that some other men will oversee the
new girl at the ministry, and I didn’t act according to their
plans, then they should have told me about that beforehand,”
Peake said on Czech Television.  Necas and Peake are due to give separate news conferences
following a Cabinet meeting in  Prague  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
