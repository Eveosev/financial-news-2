Edmund Lau has resigned as the head
of fuel oil trading in Singapore from  Brightoil Petroleum
Holdings Ltd. (933) , said a company spokeswoman.  Lau’s leaving won’t affect the company’s daily fuel oil
trading and operations because it has hired new traders
following others quitting, said the official, who asked not to
be named because of company rules. Two calls to Brightoil’s
Singapore office looking for Lau were not answered.  The company is still looking for a replacement for Quek Chin Thean, the former chief executive officer of Brightoil’s
Singapore unit, said the official. Quek resigned in November.
Paul Bradshaw, former vice president of oil storage and
operations at Brightoil, joined OW Bunker as its Asia regional
manager in October, according to OW Bunker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
