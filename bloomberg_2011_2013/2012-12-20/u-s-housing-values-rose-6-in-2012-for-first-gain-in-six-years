Home values gained an estimated 6
percent in the U.S. this year, the first increase since 2006, as
the housing market began to recover from its worst slump since
the 1930s,  Zillow Inc. (Z)  said today.  Values have climbed more than $1.3 trillion to $23.7
trillion since the end of last year and probably will continue
to rise in 2013, the Seattle-based home-listing service said in
a statement. Residential values had declined each year since
2007, with the biggest drop in 2008, when homes lost more than
$3.2 trillion in value, Zillow said.  Low interest  rates , improving employment and  prices  that
remain almost 30 percent below their July 2006 peak have drawn
buyers back into the market. A limited  inventory  of homes for
sale has helped push up prices.  “The housing market really turned a corner in 2012, as
historic affordability and sustained investor interest helped
keep demand at a boil,”  Stan Humphries , Zillow’s chief
economist, said in the statement. “As home values rise, and
more homeowners are freed from negative equity, we can expect a
continued slow transition to a more normal housing
environment.”  Sales of previously owned homes jumped 5.9 percent in
November from the previous month to reach an annual pace of 5.04
million, the most in three years, the National Association of
Realtors reported today from  Washington . The median resale price
was $180,600, up 10 percent from November 2011.  Permits to build new homes, a proxy for future
construction, rose to a four-year high last month, the Commerce
Department said yesterday.  ‘Virtuous Cycle’  Rising demand is expected to fuel a “virtuous circle”
that will drive economic growth, housing construction and price
increases, Michael Widner, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus &
Co., wrote in a note to investors yesterday.  Los Angeles  added $122 billion in home value this year, the
most of any metropolitan area, bringing the value of residences
in the region to $1.8 trillion, Zillow said. New York-area
values rose $11.1 billion, also to $1.8 trillion, after losing
$66.3 billion last year.  Philadelphia was the only metro area of the U.S.’s 30
largest with a loss in value, declining $1.6 billion to $513.4
billion, the firm said.  Nationwide, home values remain down about $5.8 trillion
from their peak of $29.5 trillion in the third quarter of 2006,
according to Zillow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
