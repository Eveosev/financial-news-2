Patrizia Immobilien AG (P1Z) , which led
Germany’s biggest real-estate acquisition this year, agreed to
buy U.K.-based Tamar Capital Group Ltd. for an undisclosed sum.  The deal gives Patrizia about 560 million pounds ($910
million) of commercial, retail and office real estate assets,
the Augsburg, Germany-based company said in a statement today.
London-based Tamar will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Patrizia starting in January.  Overseas buyers are investing in U.K. property as a weak
pound, a reputation as a safe haven and returns that beat
financing costs help make assets attractive. Tamar also operates
in France, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany and Belgium.  The purchase offers Patrizia “the possibility to
strengthen its presence in various core European markets,
especially in the U.K. and  France ,” the company said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
