Following is the text of the Gross
Domestic Product from the Commerce Department.  Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and
services produced by labor and property located in the United
States -- increased at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the
third quarter of 2012 (that is, from the second quarter to the
third quarter), according to the “third” estimate released by
the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  In the second quarter, real
GDP increased 1.3 percent.  The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete
source data than were available for the “second” estimate issued
last month.  In the second estimate, the increase in real GDP
was 2.7 percent (see “Revisions” on page 3).  The third estimate
has not greatly changed the general picture of the economy for
the third quarter except that personal consumption expenditures
(PCE) is now showing a modest pickup, and imports is now showing
a downturn.  The increase in real GDP in the third quarter primarily
reflected positive contributions from PCE, private inventory
investment, federal government spending, residential fixed
investment, and exports that were partly offset by a negative
contribution from nonresidential fixed investment.  Imports,
which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased.  The acceleration in real GDP in the third quarter
primarily reflected upturns in private inventory investment and
in federal government spending, a downturn in imports, an upturn
in state and local government spending, and an acceleration in
residential fixed investment that were partly offset by a
downturn in nonresidential fixed investment and a deceleration
in exports.  ___________________________________  FOOTNOTE.  Quarterly estimates are expressed at seasonally

the third-quarter change in real GDP after subtracting 0.10
percentage point from the second-quarter change.  Motor vehicle
output subtracted 0.25 percentage point from the third-quarter
change in real GDP after adding 0.20 percentage point to the
second-quarter change.  The price index for gross domestic purchases, which
measures prices paid by U.S. residents, increased 1.4 percent in
the third quarter, the same increase as in the second estimate;
this index increased 0.7 percent in the second quarter.
Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for gross
domestic purchases increased 1.2 percent in the third quarter,
compared with an increase of 1.4 percent in the second.  Real personal consumption expenditures increased 1.6
percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 1.5
percent in the second.  Durable goods increased 8.9 percent, in
contrast to a decrease of 0.2 percent.  Nondurable goods
increased 1.2 percent, compared with an increase of 0.6 percent.
Services increased 0.6 percent, compared with an increase of 2.1
percent.  Real nonresidential fixed investment decreased 1.8 percent
in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of 3.6 percent.
Nonresidential structures was unchanged in the third quarter; in
the second quarter, structures increased 0.6 percent.  Equipment
and software decreased 2.6 percent in the third quarter, in
contrast to an increase of 4.8 percent in the second.  Real
residential fixed investment increased 13.5 percent, compared
with an increase of 8.5 percent.  Real exports of goods and services increased 1.9 percent
in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 5.3 percent
in the second.  Real imports of goods and services decreased 0.6
percent, in contrast to an increase of 2.8 percent.  Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross
investment increased 9.5 percent in the third quarter, in
contrast to a decrease of 0.2 percent in the second.  National
defense increased 12.9 percent, in contrast to a decrease of 0.2
percent.  Nondefense increased 3.0 percent, in contrast to a
decrease of 0.4 percent.  Real state and local government
consumption expenditures and gross investment increased 0.3
percent, in contrast to a decrease of 1.0 percent.  The change in real private inventories added 0.73
percentage point to the third-quarter change in real GDP, after
subtracting 0.46 percentage point from the second-quarter change.
Private businesses increased inventories $60.3 billion in the
third quarter, following increases of $41.4 billion in the
second and $56.9 billion in the first.  Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in
private inventories -- increased 2.4 percent in the third
quarter, compared with an increase of 1.7 percent in the second.  Gross domestic purchases  Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S.
residents of goods and services wherever produced -- increased
2.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of
1.0 percent in the second.  Gross national product  Real gross national product -- the goods and services
produced by the labor and property supplied by U.S. residents --
increased 2.9 percent in the third quarter, compared with an
increase of 2.1 percent in the second.  GNP includes, and GDP
excludes, net receipts of income from the rest of the world,
which decreased $4.7 billion in the third quarter after
increasing $27.4 billion in the second; in the third quarter,
receipts decreased $2.0 billion, and payments increased $2.7
billion.  Current-dollar GDP  Current-dollar GDP -- the market value of the nation’s
output of goods and services -- increased 5.9 percent, or $225.4
billion, in the third quarter to a level of $15,811.0 billion.
In the second quarter, current-dollar GDP increased 2.8 percent,
or $107.3 billion.  Gross domestic income  Real gross domestic income (GDI), which measures the
output of the economy as the costs incurred and the incomes
earned in the production of GDP, increased 1.4 percent in the
third quarter, in contrast to a decrease of 0.7 percent in the
second.  For a given quarter, the estimates of GDP and GDI may
differ for a variety of reasons, including the incorporation of
largely independent source data. However, over longer time spans,
the estimates of GDP and GDI tend to follow similar patterns of
change.  Revisions  The “third” estimate of the third-quarter percent change
in real GDP is 0.4 percentage point, or $14.4 billion, more than
the “second” estimate issued last month, primarily reflecting an
upward revision to personal consumption expenditures, a downward
revision to imports, and upward revisions to exports and to
state and local government spending.  Advance Estimate   Second Estimate   Third Estimate  (Percent change from preceding quarter)

inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments)
increased $45.7 billion in the third quarter, compared with an
increase of $21.8 billion in the second quarter.  Current-
production cash flow (net cash flow with inventory valuation
adjustment) -- the internal funds available to corporations for
investment -- increased $32.5 billion in the third quarter,
compared with an increase of $6.0 billion in the second.  Taxes on corporate income increased $9.1 billion in the
third quarter, in contrast to a decrease of $10.3 billion in the
second.  Profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital
consumption adjustments increased $36.7 billion in the third
quarter, compared with an increase of $31.9 billion in the
second.  Dividends increased $12.8 billion, compared with an
increase of $20.4 billion; current-production undistributed
profits increased $23.8 billion, compared with an increase of
$11.6 billion.  Domestic profits of financial corporations increased $68.1
billion in the third quarter, in contrast to a decrease of $39.7
billion in the second.  Domestic profits of nonfinancial
corporations decreased $14.1 billion in the third quarter, in
contrast to an increase of $27.8 billion in the second.  In the
third quarter, real gross value added of nonfinancial
corporations decreased, and profits per unit of real value added
was unchanged, reflecting an increase in unit prices that was
offset by increases in both the unit labor costs and unit
nonlabor costs corporations incurred.  The rest-of-the-world component of profits decreased $8.2
billion in the third quarter, in contrast to an increase of
$33.6 billion in the second.  This measure is calculated as (1)
receipts by U.S. residents of earnings from their foreign
affiliates plus dividends received by U.S. residents from
unaffiliated foreign corporations minus (2) payments by U.S.
affiliates of earnings to their foreign parents plus dividends
paid by U.S. corporations to unaffiliated foreign residents.
The third-quarter decrease was accounted for by a larger
increase in payments than in receipts.  Profits before tax with inventory valuation adjustment is
the best available measure of industry profits because estimates
of the capital consumption adjustment by industry do not exist.
This measure reflects depreciation-accounting practices used for
federal income tax returns.  According to this measure, domestic
profits of financial corporations increased.  The increase in
profits of financial corporation’s was more than accounted for
by an increase in “other” financial industries.   Domestic
profits of nonfinancial corporations decreased, primarily
reflecting decreases in wholesale trade and in manufacturing
that were partly offset by an increase in “other” nonfinancial
industries.  Within manufacturing, durable goods industries
accounted for most of the decrease.  However, within nondurable
goods, a notable decrease in chemical products was largely
offset by increases in “other” nondurable goods and in petroleum
and coal products.  Profits before tax increased $86.2 billion in the third
quarter, in contrast to a decrease of $16.3 billion in the
second.  The before-tax measure of profits does not reflect, as
does profits from current production, the capital consumption
and inventory valuation adjustments.  These adjustments convert
depreciation of fixed assets and inventory withdrawals reported
on a tax-return, historical-cost basis to the current-cost
measures used in the national income and product accounts.  The
capital consumption adjustment increased $2.4 billion in the
third quarter (from -$202.4 billion to -$200.0 billion), in
contrast to a decrease of $1.7 billion in the second.  The
inventory valuation adjustment decreased $42.8 billion (from
$16.0 billion to -$26.8 billion), in contrast to an increase of
$39.7 billion.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department,  http://www.bea.gov .  To contact the reporter on this story:
