Roche Holding AG (ROG)  favors acquisitions
of as much as $7 billion over spending cash on share buybacks,
Chief Financial Officer Alan Hippe told Bloomberg Industries
analysts at a meeting.  The company is looking for innovative technologies valued
at $6 billion to $7 billion, including gene sequencing,
Bloomberg Industries wrote in a note to clients today, citing
Hippe. Roche, based in  Basel , Switzerland, also is seeking
smaller product deals to complement its existing offerings, the
CFO told the analysts.  The acquisition strategy and potential spending range is
similar to those of other pharmaceutical companies such as
Sanofi and Roche’s cross-town rival Novartis AG, Bloomberg
Industries wrote. Roche is the most leveraged large drugmaker,
with a net debt-to-assets ratio of 25 percent, according to
Bloomberg Industries. The company plans to use cash to pay down
debt with a goal of 15 percent leverage, Hippe said.  Illumina Inc. (ILMN)  gained in Frankfurt trading today after Swiss
newspaper L’Agefi said Roche may have agreed to buy the U.S.
maker of DNA sequencing equipment for $66 a share, compared with
an unsuccessful bid of $51 a share earlier this year. The Swiss
newspaper cited information that “appears trustworthy though
couldn’t be verified.” Alexander Klauser, a spokesman for
Roche, said the company doesn’t comment on “market rumors.”  Martin Voegtli , an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, said
he thinks the reported bid is “highly unlikely.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
