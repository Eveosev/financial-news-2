(Corrects reference to Veolia project in  New York City  in
third paragraph of story published Dec. 20.)  KKR & Co. and United Water, a
subsidiary of France’s  Suez Environnement Co. (SEV) , have formed a
partnership to a operate water and wastewater system in Bayonne,
New Jersey.  The joint venture will become the operator under a 40-year
agreement with the Bayonne Municipal Utilities Authority,
according to a statement today. The partnership has paid $150
million to the authority and has agreed to spend another $157
million on the system over the life of the contract. New York-
based KKR will fund 90 percent of the venture.  The agreement follows another innovative private-public
deal between  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , the world’s biggest water
company, and the city of  New York , Maxime Serrano Bardisa, a
London-based analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said
today in an interview.  “It’s too early to say whether it’s a trend, but the
market is definitely trying to find new ways of financing
infrastructure and supplying water more efficiently,” he said.
“The New York example is one, and in Bayonne is another.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
