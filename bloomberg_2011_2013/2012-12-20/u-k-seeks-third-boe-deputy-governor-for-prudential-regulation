Britain’s Treasury is seeking a
third deputy governor at the  Bank of England  as part of its
overhaul of banking regulation in the aftermath of the financial
crisis, according to a notice on the government’s website.  The Treasury is seeking a deputy governor for prudential
regulation, a role that will be created as part of the Financial
Services Bill due to take effect next year.  The advert  said the
new deputy governor will work closely with the chancellor of the
exchequer, and will be the chief executive officer of the
Prudential Regulation Authority as well as a member of the
central bank’s Financial Policy Committee.  “The successful candidate must demonstrate that he or she
can successfully lead, influence and manage the formation of the
PRA, inspiring confidence and credibility both with the PRA,
throughout financial markets and in the wider public arena,”
the advert said.  The role carries a salary of 260,000 pounds ($423,400) plus
pension. That compares with the 263,020 pounds in salary and
benefits earned in 2011-2012 by  Paul Tucker , deputy governor for
financial stability, and 260,401 pounds earned by Charlie Bean,
deputy governor for monetary policy.  BOE governor-designate  Mark Carney  will earn 480,000 pounds
when he takes over in July, plus a further 144,000 pounds in
lieu of pension, and a 250,000-pound annual housing allowance,
the central bank said yesterday.  The closing date for applications role is 9 a.m. on Jan.
14, and interviews are scheduled to take place between Jan. 21
and Feb. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
