Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
fell from its highest level since March as the yen strengthened
amid concern U.S. budget talks are stalling. The Bank of Japan
is scheduled to conclude a policy meeting today.  Canon Inc. (7751) , which gets 27 percent of its revenue from the
Americas, lost 3 percent. Capcom Co. plunged 9.4 percent after
the gamemaker cut its profit forecast and delayed the release of
a new game. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. sank 6.6 percent after the
transport ministry issued a warning to the automaker for being
“passive” after a fourth round of recalls.  The Nikkei 225 lost 1 percent to 10,062.82 as of 12:31 p.m.
in  Tokyo  after reaching its highest level since March 28
yesterday. Volume on the gauge was 77 percent higher than the
30-day average. The Topix Index fell 0.2 percent to 837.56, with
about three stocks falling for every two that gained.  “Cracks appeared in the fiscal-cliff negotiations,” said
Stan Shamu, Melbourne-based strategist at IG Markets Ltd. “The
Republicans failed to come up with a reasonable compromise to
President Obama’s proposal. Market participants decided to
exercise caution despite U.S. leaders still insisting they are
hoping to have something done by Christmas.”  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures were little changed
today. The gauge slid 0.8 percent yesterday as deteriorating
 federal budget  negotiations fueled concern that $600 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts will be triggered if a
compromise is not reached by the end of the year.  Budget Battle  White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said
President  Barack Obama  would veto a Republican tax-and-spending
proposal because it would put “too big a burden on the middle
class.” House Speaker John Boehner’s plan would raise taxes on
income over $1 million rather than the $400,000 threshold the
president proposed. Lawmakers may vote today on Boehner’s plan.  The yen gained against most major counterparts today as a
lack of progress in budget talks boosted demand for haven
assets. The yen rose to 84.24 per dollar, and gained to 111.41
per euro. A stronger yen hurts overseas earnings for Japanese
exporters when repatriated.  Japanese exporters led declines, with transport and
electronic makers the  biggest drags  among the Topix’s 33
industry groups.  Canon fell 3 percent to 3,350 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , an
automaker that counts North America as its biggest market, slid
2.1 percent to 3,005 yen.  Monetary Stimulus  The Bank Of Japan will probably increase monetary stimulus
after a two-day policy meeting that ends today, 17 of the 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg say. The policy board will
discuss its inflation target at today’s meeting, the Nikkei
newspaper reported without attribution.  Among other stocks that fell today, Capcom tumbled 9.4
percent to 1,338 yen. The video-game company reduced its target
for operating profit for this fiscal year by 37 percent to 10
billion yen, citing weakening sales of “Resident Evil 6” and a
delayed launch for “Monster Hunter 4.” The stock was cut to
equalweight from overweight at Barclays Plc.  Mitsubishi Motors dropped 6.6 percent to 85 yen, the
second-biggest decline on the Nikkei 225. The transport ministry
said the automaker made “inappropriate decisions” in regards
to a series of recalls tied to an oil leak. The company said it
will call back eight models, including the Town Box and the
Minica minicar, for a total of 1.21 million vehicles in  Japan .  Nissan Drops  Nissan Motor Co. slumped 6.8 percent to 787 yen, the
biggest drop on the Nikkei 225. The carmaker’s investment rating
was cut by Nomura Holdings Inc. on concerns it may miss its
profit targets on higher costs and slower sales.  The Topix trades at 0.99 times  book value , compared with
2.1 for the S&P 500 and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than the value of their assets.  The Nikkei 225’s 14-day  relative strength index  was at
78.46 today, trading above the 70 level for a seventh day. Some
traders use a level above 70 as a sign the market is overbought.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  climbed 1.5
percent to 19.08, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.4
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
