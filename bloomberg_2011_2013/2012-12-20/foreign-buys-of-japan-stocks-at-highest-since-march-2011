Net purchases of Japanese stocks by
Overseas investors rose last week to the highest since last
year’s record earthquake and tsunami, according to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.  Foreign investors were net buyers of Japanese stocks last
week for the fifth consecutive week, purchasing a total of 462.9
billion yen ($5.5 billion) more shares than they sold on the
Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya bourses, the exchange said. That’s the
most since the week ending March 18, 2011, when net purchases
were 955.2 billion yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  has gained 16 percent since
Nov. 14 when the previous government said they would call
elections. The Liberal Democratic was returned to power in a
Dec. 16 poll on pledges to boost government spending and press
the Bank of  Japan  for more monetary stimulus.  “Foreign investors are starting to expect more aggressive
policies and economic stimulus measures in Japan,” said Jun Yunoki, an equity analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. “Foreign
investors’ risk tolerence is increasing and that’s being
directed with capital inflows to Japanese stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
