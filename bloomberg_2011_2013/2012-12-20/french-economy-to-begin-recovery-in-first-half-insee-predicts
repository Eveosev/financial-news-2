France ’s economy will begin a
“slight” recovery in the first half of next year after
shrinking in the final quarter of 2012, national statistics
office Insee predicted.  Europe’s second-largest economy  will probably shrink 0.2
percent in the three months through December, before advancing
0.1 percent in each of the next two quarters, Insee said in its
latest set of forecasts.  The prediction shows France’s economy is barely growing at
a time when President  Francois Hollande  is seeking to improve
the competitiveness of the nation’s industry and reduce the
 budget deficit . In the months ahead, growth will rely on demand
holding up from both consumers and foreigners, Insee said.  “Demand should be sustained in the first half of 2013,
meaning the economy should advance, slightly,” Insee said.
“Exports should accelerate a bit, helped by the global recovery
and the past depreciation of the euro.”  With companies such as PSA Peugeot Citroen slashing
thousands of jobs,  unemployment  will continue to climb, Insee
said. The statistics office predicts that non-farm payrolls will
shrink by 80,000 in the first half, driving up the  unemployment
rate  to 10.9 percent.  “The high level of unemployment and weak capacity
utilization will slow inflationary pressure,” Insee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
