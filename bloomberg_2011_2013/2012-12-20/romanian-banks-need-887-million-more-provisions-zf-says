Romanian banks will be obliged to
make provisions of about 3 billion lei ($887 million) next year
to cover a difference from the re-evaluation of assets pledged
as collateral for loans,  Ziarul Financiar  said.  The increase in provisions will probably prompt some banks
to boost their capital, the Bucharest-based newspaper reported,
citing unidentified people from the banking industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
