Time Warner Inc.’s CNN said it hired
ABC News Washington reporter Jake Tapper to anchor a weekday
show, following through on the news network’s President  Jeff Zucker ’s pledge to create new programming.  Tapper will begin anchoring and serve as CNN’s chief
Washington correspondent early next year, Christa Robinson, a
spokeswoman for CNN, said in a telephone interview. He joined
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC News in 2003 and most recently served as
the network’s senior White House correspondent.  CNN announced Nov. 29 it hired former NBC Universal chief
Zucker as it attempts to improve ratings after struggling in
recent years to compete with News Corp.’s Fox News and  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) ’s MSNBC. Zucker said last month the network needed “to
find new programs that will make everything better.” Zucker
officially begins in January.  “Jake is an exceptional reporter and communicator, and we
look forward to developing a program that takes advantage of all
of his strengths,” CNN Executive Vice President Ken Jautz said
today in a  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
