Angola, Africa’s second-largest oil
producer, will cut exports of Saturno crude in February to one
cargo of 950,000 barrels, one less than January, according to a
preliminary loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  This is the third month that Saturno has been exported. The
grade is produced from  BP Plc (BP/) ’s PSVM project, an abbreviation
for Plutao, Saturno, Venus and Marte fields, that has a target
output of 150,000 barrels a day, the company said on Nov. 1.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
