India ’s 10-year government bonds
gained, pushing the yield toward a seven-week low, before the
central bank buys debt tomorrow to help ease a cash crunch.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will purchase as much as 80
billion rupees ($1.5 billion) of notes due in 2018, 2020 and
2026, according to a statement on its website on Dec. 18.
Lenders borrowed 1.65 trillion rupees from the RBI’s overnight
repurchase window yesterday, the most since March, reflecting a
shortage of cash in the banking system.  “Bonds are holding up as the open-market purchases are
expected to spur demand,” said N.S. Venkatesh, Mumbai-based
head of treasury at state-run  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)   The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.15 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. It
touched 8.14 percent on Dec. 14 and Dec. 17, which were the
lowest levels since Oct. 29. The yield has dropped 42 basis
points this year.  The central bank has bought 1.1 trillion rupees of
 government securities  this fiscal year that started April 1.
Indian local-currency sovereign bonds have returned 10 percent
in 2012, the best performance after Indonesia among 10 Asian
indexes compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose five basis
points to 7.72 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
