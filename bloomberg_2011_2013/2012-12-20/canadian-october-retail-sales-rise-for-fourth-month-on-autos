Canadian  retail sales  rose a fourth
straight month in October, exceeding economist forecasts on
gains in automobile and gasoline purchases.  Sales rose 0.7 percent to C$39.4 billion ($39.9 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists  surveyed  by
 Bloomberg News  forecast a 0.2 percent increase, based on the
median of 24 projections.  The data adds to evidence the world’s 11th-largest economy
may be rebounding after a weak third quarter. Other reports
published this month have shown greater-than-forecast increases
in employment and wholesale sales.  Automobile and parts sales rose 1.6 percent to C$8.96
billion, while gasoline station receipts gained 1.6 percent to
C$5.10 billion, according to the report.  Purchases  excluding  the motor vehicle and parts category
rose 0.5 percent to C$30.5 billion. On that basis, economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast 0.2 percent growth.  The  volume  of sales, which excludes the effects of price
changes and more closely reflects the industry’s contribution to
economic growth, rose 0.3 percent.  Sales in October were 1.7 percent higher than  a year
earlier ,  Statistics Canada  said.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said average weekly
earnings of non-farm payroll workers rose 2.8 percent in October
from a year ago, led by a 5.8 percent gain for accommodation and
food services. On a monthly basis, earnings rose 0.9 percent,
while payroll employment fell by 10,200.  To contact the reporter on this story:
