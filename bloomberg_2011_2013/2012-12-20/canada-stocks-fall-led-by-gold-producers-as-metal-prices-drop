Canadian  stocks  fell, led by gold
producers as the metal dropped to its lowest level since August
after U.S. economic growth beat forecasts.  Yamana Gold Inc. and Goldcorp Inc. dropped at least 2.1
percent.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  of Vancouver declined 1.4 percent
as the price of the metal retreated the most in almost six
months.  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  rose 3.1 percent, the most in almost
three weeks, after the aircraft maker announced its second sale
agreement for the CSeries jet in two days.  The S&P/TSX fell 14.92 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,388.71
in Toronto. The equity gauge has gained 3.6 percent this year.  “Gold the commodity has been very weak and it’s broken
down here,” said  John Kinsey , a  fund manager  with Caldwell
Securities Ltd. in Toronto. His firm manages about C$1 billion
($1.01 billion). “That’s put the kibosh on gold stocks.”  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, more than previously reported, and exceeding the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg Survey, which
called for a 2.8 percent advance.  Basic-materials companies  contributed  most to losses in the
S&P/TSX as four of 10 industry groups retreated. Trading volume
was 4.4 percent higher than the 30-day average.  Gold Miners  Gold for February delivery dropped 1.3 percent to settle at
$1,645.90 an ounce in  New York , the lowest since August. The
S&P/TSX Gold  subindex  dropped 1.5 percent as 28 of 32 members
declined. Gold mining companies account for 8.8 percent of the
S&P/TSX weighting, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yamana, based in Toronto, fell 2.4 percent to C$16.39 and
Vancouver-based Goldcorp declined 2.1 percent to C$35.17.
 Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  lost 0.7 percent to C$33.22. Toronto-based
Barrick and Goldcorp are the world’s largest producers of the
metal. Yamana is Canada’s fourth-biggest.  Silver Wheaton slipped to C$34.39 and Silvercorp Metals
Inc. of Vancouver declined 2.5 percent to C$5.02. Silver for
March delivery slumped 4.6 percent to $29.678 an ounce in New
York, the biggest loss since June.  Capstone Mining Corp. (CS)  sank 7.3 percent to C$2.30 after the
Vancouver-based copper miner issued 2013 production guidance
yesterday of 85 million pounds of copper, plus or minus 5
percent, less than the forecast by PI Financial Corp.  “The contracted output is due to much lower-than-expected
output at the Minto mine,” due to lower copper grades, said
Aleem Ladak, mining analyst in  Vancouver  at PI Financial, in a
note to clients today.  Bombardier gained to C$3.68 after saying that AirBaltic
agreed to buy 10 CS300 airliners in a deal with a value of $764
million that may rise to $1.57 billion if purchase rights are
exercised. The Montreal-based company said yesterday an unnamed
carrier signed a letter of intent to buy 12 of the smaller CS100
models, which have a list value of about $870 million, with
options to buy 18 more jets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
