-  AB Panevezio Statybos Trestas (PTR1L) ,
 Lithuania ’s largest publicly traded construction company, had
its biggest intraday gain in more than a year after saying the
U.S. investor Firebird Management LLC bought a stake.  The shares gained 7.4 percent, the most since Nov. 28,
2011, to 0.988 euro at 10:15 a.m. in Vilnius, valuing the
company at 16.2 million euros ($21.4 million). Volume of 9,210
shares in 15 minutes of trading was about half the three-month
daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  New York-based Firebird, whose funds invest mainly in
publicly traded shares in eastern  Europe , notified PST that it
had bought 5.73 percent of the Lithuanian builder’s shares, the
company said in a statement on the Nasdaq OMX exchange group’s
Baltic website after trading ended yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
