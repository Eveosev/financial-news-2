Most Asian  stocks  fell, with the
regional benchmark index trading near a 16-month high, amid
concern U.S. budget negotiations are faltering and as a surging
yen weighed on Japanese stocks even after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
boosted its asset purchases for the third time in four months.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which gets a fifth of its revenue

level since August 2011.  “U.S. budget talks could be a reason for a short-term
correction quite soon,” said  Alex Wong , a Hong Kong-based
director at Ample Capital Ltd. “People are still taking profits
towards the year-end and also ahead of the U.S. budget talk
solution. The pattern of the correction probably would be steep
and fast but probably won’t last too long. The overall trend is
up.”  Asia’s benchmark equities index has risen about 14 percent
this year as central banks around the world took action to spur
growth and on signs of recovery in the U.S. and China. The gauge

0.5 percent.  Budget Battle  Futures on the  S&P 500 index  fell 0.1 percent today. The
gauge dropped 0.8 percent yesterday, when White House
Communications Director  Dan Pfeiffer  said President Barack Obama
would veto a tax and spending proposal presented by House
Speaker  John Boehner  because it would put “too big a burden on
the middle class.” A failure to reach a compromise before year-
end will result in $600 billion in automatic tax increases and
spending cuts, the so-called fiscal cliff.  Companies that do business in the U.S. fell, with Samsung
dropping 0.8 percent to 1.503 million won.  Techtronic Industries

Masaaki Shirakawa and two deputies expire.  “Today is just a beginning for what will happen down the
road,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank Ltd.
in Tokyo, which oversees about 15 trillion yen ($179 billion).
“The BOJ wouldn’t have moved if there was no political
pressure. People will be raising bets that next year the LDP-led
government and the BOJ will join forces and do more to combat
deflation.”  Mitsubishi UFJ advanced 1.2 percent to 440 yen.  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , the country’s second-biggest lender
by market value, rose 0.8 percent to 3,035 yen.  Nissan slumped 7.4 percent to 782 yen after Nomura cut its
