The French Parliament today passed
President  Francois Hollande ’s 2013 budget law, imposing a 75
percent tax on income of more than 1 million euros ($1.33
million) and forcing a 10 billion-euro cut in public spending.  Hollande’s 2013 blueprint relies on 20 billion euros in tax
increases and new income tax brackets for high earners. The
moves are aimed at bringing the  budget deficit  to 3 percent of
gross domestic product next year from a projected 4.5 percent
this year. The budget predicts growth of 0.8 percent.  Hollande’s Socialist Party has an absolute majority in the
lower chamber, paving the way for the law’s passage even after
his Green and Communist allies in the upper house rejected his
budgetary plan, calling it too austere.  The Parliament also passed today the president’s five-year
budget target that includes a 0.3 percent deficit in 2017, when
his mandate will end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
