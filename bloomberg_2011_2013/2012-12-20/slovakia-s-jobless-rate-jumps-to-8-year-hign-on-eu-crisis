Slovakia’s unemployment rate jumped
to the highest since May 2004 amid  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Unemployment in November rose to 13.9 percent from 13.7
percent reported the previous month, the Slovak Center for
Labor, Family and Social Affairs said today in Bratislava.  The Slovak central bank lowered its 2013 economic-growth
forecast to 1.6 percent from 2 percent on Dec. 7, citing
weakening exports and domestic demand. Even as the Slovak
economy has been weathering Europe’s crisis better than its
peers, the outlook remains uncertain, the central bank said.
Unemployment in Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, has
failed to fall as companies streamline operations to remain
competitive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
