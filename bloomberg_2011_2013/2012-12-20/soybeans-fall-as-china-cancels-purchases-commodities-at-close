eased supply concerns after a drought reduced harvests in the

January delivery surged 4.3 percent to $3.462 per million
British thermal units, the biggest gain since Dec. 5.  U.K. gas for next-month delivery traded near the lowest

4:18 p.m. London time. That’s equivalent to $10.84 per million

0.7 percent to $3.0575 a gallon.  Gasoline futures for January delivery climbed 0.4 percent
to $2.7543 a gallon.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures fell from a record on speculation that high
