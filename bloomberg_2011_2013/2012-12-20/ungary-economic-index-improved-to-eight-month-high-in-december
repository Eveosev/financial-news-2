Hungary’s  economic-sentiment  index
improved to an eight-month high in December on rising business
confidence and a more optimistic consumer outlook.  The sentiment index rose to minus 21.2 from minus 22.4 in
November, the GKI research institute in Budapest said in an e-
mailed statement. The business-confidence index advanced to
minus 11.3 from minus 12.4 while the  consumer confidence  gauge
jumped to minus 49.3 from minus 50.7.  The economic index has “continuously improved since
September, albeit in small steps,” GKI said. It also said the
gauge still remains below April’s levels, which were the
strongest reading this year.  Hungary’s  economy  is battling its second recession in four
years and is projected to recover very gradually with the
central bank seeing an expansion of 0.5 percent in 2013.
Economic output is set to remain below potential in the medium
term, the bank said in its quarterly Inflation Report published
yesterday.  GKI’s indexes are calculated based on a balance of positive
and negative answers to questions about the outlook for the
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
