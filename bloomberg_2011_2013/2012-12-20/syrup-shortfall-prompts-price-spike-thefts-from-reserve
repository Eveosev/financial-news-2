The price of maple syrup is nearing
a record, as warm winters and high production costs curb output
and make the iconic Canadian sweetener a target for thieves.  The price of the breakfast-table treat, made from the sap
of maple trees, has climbed 182 percent since the end of 1980,
more than crude oil and gold.  “The price is high now because it’s a lot more expensive
to produce” compared with other sweeteners, said  Michael
Farrell , maple syrup researcher at  Cornell University  in Ithaca,
 New York , by telephone. “It’s an incredibly labor-intensive
process and the technology hasn’t kept up with demand.”  Output of Canadian maple products -- including syrup, sugar
and butter --  dropped about 8 percent this year to 7.9 million
gallons, according to the country’s  statistics  agency. The price
paid to producers in Quebec -- where more than three-quarters of
the world’s syrup originates -- rose 0.7 percent to C$38.34
($38.76) per gallon. U.S. production fell 32 percent this year
to 1.91 million gallons (7.19 million liters), according to the
Department of Agriculture.  That supply falls short of demand. U.S. syrup consumption
rose to 2.7 ounces per person this year from 1 ounce per person
in the 1970s, Cornell’s Farrell said.  Demand is so high for the pancake topping that people have
resorted to theft. Three men were arrested and five others are
being sought after syrup was stolen from a  Quebec  warehouse,
according to a Dec. 18 statement from provincial police. The
Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers said in August its
warehouse in St-Louis-de Blandford, which holds about C$30
million of the province’s syrup reserve, had been burglarized.  Bad Harvest  “Our main market is still the  United States  and in 2012,
the harvest was very bad,” said Simon Trepanier, executive
director of the federation, the sole marketing body that
represents 7,300 maple businesses in the country. Syrup prices
spiked three years ago when low inventory prompted record
purchases of maple syrup to hold in reserve, Trepanier said.  The process of extracting the sweetener is tedious. Sap is
sucked from maple trees via tubes that drip into buckets
attached to the tree trunks. The liquid is heated in cabins,
known as sugar shacks, where it is reduced into syrup. Forty
gallons of sap are needed to make one gallon of syrup. If the
weather is too warm, as it has been in recent winters, less sap,
and syrup, are produced.  Maple syrup is an item of national pride for Canadians;
astronaut Chris Hadfield, the first Canadian to take a
spacewalk, took tubes of it with him to the International Space
Station this week.  “ Canada  has a reputation throughout the world. You have
people knowing Canada for maple syrup,” Farrell said. “You
have the maple leaf on your flag. It’s something to be proud
of.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
