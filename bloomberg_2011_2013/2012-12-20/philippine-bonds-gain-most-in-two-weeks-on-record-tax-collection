Philippine 19-year sovereign bonds
gained the most in two weeks after the government reported
record tax receipts for this year, boosting optimism that debt
supply will drop in 2013. The peso fell.  President  Benigno Aquino  signed a law today that will raise
taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, which Finance Secretary Cesar
Purisima said will generate an additional 34 billion pesos ($828
million) in 2013. The  Bureau of Internal Revenue  collected 1
trillion pesos this year, compared with a target of 1.07
trillion pesos, according to a statement.  “The announcement on the tax collections was pretty
positive,” said Lito Mercado, head of trading at  Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. (RCB)  in  Manila . “The feeling is that the
authorities will borrow less with all the tax initiatives of the
government. So players would like to position now instead of
early next year.”  The yield on the government’s 8 percent notes due July 2031
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.54
percent as of 4:10 p.m. in Manila, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services. That was the biggest drop since
Dec. 4. The rate has declined 63 basis points this year.  The peso traded at 41.073 per dollar in Manila, compared
with 41.038 yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It has
advanced 6.7 percent this year, the second-best performance
among Asian currencies after the South Korean won.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, was unchanged at 4.4
percent. It fell 335 basis points this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
