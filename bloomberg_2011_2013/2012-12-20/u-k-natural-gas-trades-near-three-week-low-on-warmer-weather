U.K. natural gas for next-month
delivery traded near the lowest level this month as forecasters
predicted warmer-than-normal weather, cutting demand for the
heating fuel.  Month-ahead gas  fell 0.5 percent, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. The low temperature in  London  will be 9
degrees Celsius (48 Fahrenheit) on Dec. 23 versus a 10-year
average of minus 3 degrees, CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg
show. Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 297
million cubic meters versus an average this month of 328
million,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Gas for January lost 0.3 pence to 66.65 pence a therm at
4:18 p.m. London time. That’s equivalent to $10.84 per million
British thermal units and compares with $3.45 per million Btu of
front-month U.S. gas. The British contract declined to 66.3
pence on Dec. 13, its lowest this month.  Within-day gas  fell 0.2 percent to 65.85 pence a therm
while day-ahead gas dropped 0.4 percent to 65.5 pence a therm,
broker data show.  “With only one month to go in 2012, we believe our
European gas demand forecast of minus 2.4 percent now harbors
more downside than upside,” Thierry Bros, European gas analyst
at Societe Generale SA in Paris, said in a research report
yesterday. “European gas demand reached a peak in 2005. More
than 12 years of growth has been erased to date. The European
gas industry needs to think fast about how to boost demand.”  Imports from  Norway , the U.K.’s largest source of foreign
gas, were at a rate of 110 million cubic meters a day, in line
with the 30-day average, Gassco AS data show.  Flows from  Belgium  were at 9 million cubic meters a day,
compared with a mean since Oct. 1 of 15 million, Interconnector
Ltd. data show.  Gas accounted for 35 percent of U.K. power production at
4:15 p.m., grid data show. Coal also generated 35 percent,
nuclear 15 percent and wind 8.5 percent.  Next-day electricity  climbed 0.8 percent to 48.25 pounds a
megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
