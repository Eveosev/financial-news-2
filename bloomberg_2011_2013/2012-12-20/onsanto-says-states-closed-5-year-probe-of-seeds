Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s biggest
seed company, said  attorneys general  from  Iowa  and other states
have closed a 5-year investigation into its seed and herbicide
businesses without taking further action.  Monsanto received written notification from the Iowa
attorney general’s office that the inquiry begun in September
2007 has concluded, the St. Louis-based company said today in a
 statement  on its website. The probe was related to production
and marketing of glyphosate, a weed-killer marketed by Monsanto
as Roundup, as well as licensing of genetically modified crops.  The U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division last
month dropped its probe into possible anti-competitive practices
in the seed industry. Iowa had coordinated its inquiry with at
least six other states.  “We’re pleased that through our ongoing dialog with the
state attorneys general we were given the opportunity to share
information about our business and our commitment to serve the
 agriculture sector  that led to the successful conclusion of this
matter,” David Snively, Monsanto general counsel, said in an e-
mailed statement.  DuPont Co., which accuses its rival of anti-competitive
practices, lied in federal court about its right to use Monsanto
seed technology, U.S. District Judge Richard Webber said in an
order unsealed last month. Webber provided the order to the
justice department in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
