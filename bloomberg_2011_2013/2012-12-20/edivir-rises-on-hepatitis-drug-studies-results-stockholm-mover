Medivir AB (MVIRB)  rose to its highest level
in 10 months in Stockholm trading after results from three late-
stage trials of hepatitis treatment simeprevir showed the same
safety and efficacy as earlier studies.  The shares rose as much 19 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Feb. 17. Medivir had gained 14 percent to 71.75
kronor as of 10:10 a.m. in the Swedish capital. Volume was five
times the three-month daily average.  The studies of simeprevir, a one-pill, once-daily treatment
of chronic hepatitis C, jointly developed by Janssen and
Medivir, showed viral cure rates of 79 percent to 81 percent in
treated patients, Stockholm-based Medivir said today in a
statement. Hepatitis C may lead to chronic liver disease and the
 World Health Organization  estimates about 3 percent of the
world’s population is infected, Medivir said.  “We are extremely happy about the data from these phase
III studies,” said  Charlotte  Edenius, head of Medivir’s
Research and Development. “We look forward to seeking
regulatory approvals to bring simeprevir forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
