Carmelo Anthony returned from a two-
game layoff due to a sprained ankle to score a game-high 31
points as the New York Knicks defeated the crosstown rival
Brooklyn Nets 100-86.  The Knicks improved to 19-6 to retain their top spot in the
National Basketball Association’s Eastern Conference. Brooklyn
is six games behind New York in the conference’s Atlantic
Division.  “It’s going to be a dogfight in this division the whole
season,” Nets coach Avery Johnson told reporters. “Even though
the Knicks are leading the division, they’re not leading the
division by 15 or 20 games. It’s early in the season.”  Anthony scored 17 points in the first half as the Knicks
took a 52-48 halftime advantage last night on their home court
at Madison Square Garden. They outscored the Nets 48-38 in the
second half to hand Brooklyn its third straight loss.  “At the end of the day, these are statement games, these
are big games, divisional games,” Anthony told reporters.
“They’re right across the bridge, so these games definitely
mean a lot.”  The Knicks have won two of the three contests between the
New York teams this season. The Nets won 96-89 in overtime on
Nov. 26 in the rescheduled season opener that was postponed by
Superstorm Sandy. On Dec. 11, Anthony scored 45 points as the
Knicks won 100-97 on Jason Kidd’s tiebreaking 3-pointer with 24
seconds left.  J.R. Smith added 19 points and Tyson Chandler had 16 points
and 12 rebounds for the Knicks.  “I just wanted to close the game, I wanted to make a
statement,” Chandler said. “Tonight was a big game for us, a
game in our division, an opportunity to gain a full game as far
as the lead goes, and we have to make statements like that.”  Joe Johnson led the Nets (13-12) with 17 points, while
Deron Williams and Brook Lopez each had 16 points.  “We have a lot of season left, we’ll get it turned
around,” Avery Johnson said. “We’re going to get back in the lab
on Friday and work on some parts of our game and get this bad
taste out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
