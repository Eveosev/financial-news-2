Russian (INDEXCF)  equities rallied to a 2 1/2-
month high as the nation’s biggest natural-gas producers OAO
Gazprom and OAO Novatek climbed.  The 50-stock Micex Index gained 0.6 percent to 1,488.22 by
the close in Moscow after dropping 0.7 percent earlier. Gazprom,
 Russia ’s natural-gas export monopoly, erased earlier declines,
rising 1.6 percent. Novatek increased as much as 1.5 percent.
OAO Dixy Group, a Russian supermarket chain, surged as much as
10 percent as revenue rose 17.5 percent last month.  Gazprom’s board approved 2013  investments  at 705.4 billion
rubles ($22.9 billion), less than this year’s investment program
of 975 billion rubles. The company has the  largest weighting  on
the index at 14.6 percent. Novatek climbed after Kommersant
reported Russia’s Energy, Finance and Natural Resources
ministries, as well as the Federal Antimonopoly Service support
the company’s bid to end Gazprom’s liquefied natural gas export
monopoly. Novatek has the seventh-largest weighting on the index
at 3.9 percent.  “For investors, it’s really important that Gazprom spend
less,”  Alexei Kokin , an analyst at UralSib Capital, said by
phone from Moscow. “One of the main concerns investors have is
that all of Gazprom’s money goes to their new projects, that
there isn’t enough free  cash flow .”  The amount of Gazprom shares traded was 52.7 million,
equivalent to 1.6 times the three-month average. Novatek
increased 0.5 percent to 346.47 rubles.  Oil and gas  stocks rose
0.9 percent on average, the most of all industry groups.  Putin, TNK-BP  “This is very positive news for Novatek,”  Mark Rubinstein , head of research at IFC Metropol, said by phone.
“Currently Novatek exports LNG through Gazprom and has to pay
them a fee, while this would allow them to save on export
expenses.”  Novatek applied to the government to exempt LNG from
Gazprom’s monopoly and the ministry will respond to the request
by the end of the year, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at
a Moscow gas conference on Nov. 20.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, dropped 0.3
percent to 261.68 rubles. OAO TNK-BP Holding retreated 2.3
percent to 56.42 rubles. The Russian government is in talks with
billionaire partners in the TNK-BP oil venture about investing
all or some of proceeds from the sale of their half of the
company in Russia, President  Vladimir Putin  told reporters in
Moscow today.  BP Plc and AAR, which represents the U.K. explorer’s
billionaire partners in the venture, signed separate binding
agreements this year to sell their halves of it to Rosneft.  Offshore Zones  Russia should seek agreements with offshore zones to compel
disclosure of tax information and help reveal the main
beneficiaries of companies, Putin said. The nation also needs to
refine its legislation to better safeguard the interests of
business owners and improve Russia’s investment climate, he
said.  Russian capital outflow in 2012 is seen at between $65
billion and $67 billion, Central Bank Chairman  Sergei Ignatiev 
told reporters in Moscow on Dec. 19.  VTB Group, Russia’s second biggest lender, retreated 0.9
percent to 5.43 kopeks after rising as much as 0.8 percent
ealier. The amount of shares traded was 39 billion, equivalent
to 1.2 times the three-month average. The bank may sell new
shares next year, chief financial officer  Herbert Moos  told
reporters today.  Net income attributable to shareholders rose to 23.4
billion rubles ($760 million) for the three months through Sept.
30, from 20.4 billion rubles a year earlier, Moscow-based VTB
said today in a statement. That beat an  average estimate  of 19.7
billion rubles from 15 analysts surveyed by the lender.  Khodorkovsky Sentence  The  Bloomberg Russia-US stocks  gauge declined 0.9 percent
to 97.82 yesterday, trimming its advance this year to 8 percent.
The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S. exchange traded
fund that holds Russian shares, dropped 0.8 percent to $29.61,
while the RTS Volatility Index gained 1.6 percent to 21.08
points.  Oil slid as much as 0.8 percent to $89.26 a barrel in  New
York . Russia receives about half of its budget revenue from oil
and natural gas sales. The country’s markets are closed for New
Year and Christmas holidays in the first week of 2013.  The amount of shares traded on the Micex was 47 percent
above the 10-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index dropped 0.5 percent to 641.58.
The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  rose 0.8 percent to 1,528.89.  Mikhail Khodorkovsky , once Russia’s richest man, will be
freed from prison in 2014 after his second sentence for fraud
and  tax evasion  was reduced by two years.  Lowest Valuations  A Moscow court cut the former Yukos Oil Co. billionaire’s
sentence to 11 years from 13 years. Today’s decision may be
appealed to the  Supreme Court , Anna Usacheva, a spokeswoman for
the Moscow City court, said by text message.  Russian stocks extended their gains as the  U.S. economy 
grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter, greater
than the highest forecast in a Bloomberg survey, according to
Commerce Department data released today.  The Micex trades at about 5.4 times  estimated earnings 
after adding 6.1 percent this year. That compares with a
multiple of 10.7 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index,
which has gained 14.8 percent.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
