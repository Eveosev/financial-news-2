Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  hired Ahmed Badr as head of equities for the  Middle East  and North Africa
based in Riyadh as the investment bank shifts operations away
from Dubai.  Badr starts with immediate effect, according to an internal
memo seen by Bloomberg yesterday and confirmed by Sofia Rehman,
a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse in  London . Wafic Nsouli, Badr’s
predecessor, left the bank this week, said a person familiar
with the matter, asking not to be identified as the news hasn’t
been made public.  Credit Suisse is among firms downsizing in Dubai as equity
trading in the city hovers near a six-year low and clients
postpone initial public offerings and buyouts. EFG-Hermes
Holding SAE, the biggest publicly traded Arab investment bank
and Dubai’s top-ranked broker in terms of trading volume, is
also cutting jobs and letting at least seven people go to reduce
costs, said three people with knowledge of the matter who asked
not to be named because the plans are private.  Riyadh  has become a “key area of growth” for Credit
Suisse in the region, according to the memo. Badr joined Credit
Suisse in 2008 from HC Brokerage, where he worked as a research
analyst, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse is shrinking its Dubai operations in favor of
Riyadh and Qatar, a person with knowledge of the plans said
earlier this week on condition of anonymity. Credit Suisse’s
second-largest shareholder is the Qatar Investment Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
