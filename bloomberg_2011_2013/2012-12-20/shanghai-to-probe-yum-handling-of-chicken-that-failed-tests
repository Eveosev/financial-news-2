Shanghai said it plans to
investigate if  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM)  properly dealt with test results
that showed some chicken the company received from distributors
contained excessive levels of antibiotics.  The Shanghai  Food and Drug Administration  said tests
conducted by a third-party agency from 2010-2011 found eight
batches of chicken supplied to Yum by Liuhe Group Co. had levels
of antibiotics that didn’t meet prescribed standards. Yum, which
operates the KFC and Pizza Hut chains in  China , was made aware
of these results, the agency said on its website yesterday.  State-broadcaster China Central Television prompted greater
scrutiny of the nation’s poultry industry this week when it
reported suppliers including Liuhe weren’t properly inspecting
chicken bought from farmers in Shandong province for antibiotics
and hormones. Yum, in a statement posted on its official KFC
microblog in China, said after the CCTV report that it stopped
buying from Liuhe in August this year.  Yum spokeswomen Amy Sherwood and Virginia Ferguson didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail today seeking comment.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
