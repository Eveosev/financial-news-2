ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG) , the maker of
Chef Boyardee and Healthy Choice meals, reported second-quarter
profit that topped analysts’ estimates, helped by sales in its
consumer foods business.  Net income increased 17 percent to $211.6 million, or 51
cents a share, from $180.2 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier,
the Omaha, Nebraska-based company said today in a statement.
Excluding some items, profit was 57 cents a share. The average
of 13 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 55 cents.  Chief Executive Officer Gary Rodkin last month announced
the acquisition of  Ralcorp Holdings Inc. (RAH) , the maker of private-
brand foods, for $5 billion. The deal will more than quadruple
ConAgra’s private-label sales to $4.5 billion, creating a
company with total sales of about $18 billion.  Second-quarter  revenue  increased 8.9 percent to $3.74
billion. Analysts projected $3.7 billion, on average. The
consumer foods unit, ConAgra’s largest, posted sales of $2.4
billion, an increase of 11 percent.  ConAgra  rose  1.2 percent to $30.32 at 9:59 a.m. in  New
York . The shares had gained 13 percent this year through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
