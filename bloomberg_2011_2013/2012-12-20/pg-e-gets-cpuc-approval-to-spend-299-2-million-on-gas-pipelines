PG&E Corp. (PCG)  can collect $299.2
million from customers for a pipeline safety plan, the
 California  Public Safety Commission said.  The commission voted 5-0 for approval at a meeting today in
San Francisco. PG&E, owner of a natural gas pipeline that
exploded two years ago and killed eight people in San Bruno,
California, will get 39 percent of the $768.8 million it
requested through 2014 to improve its system, according to
today’s decision.  The commission removed a provision in an earlier proposed
decision that would have cut PG&E’s return on equity to 6.05
percent on safety investments for five years.  PG&E will use the funds to test, upgrade and replace gas
lines and install automatic-shut off valves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
