Chelsea was drawn to play  Sparta
Prague  in the round of 32 in soccer’s Europa League.  The winner of that matchup will play Ajax or Steaua
Bucharest in the round of 16.  Chelsea won the elite  Champions League  in May but this
month became the first winner to be eliminated in the next
season’s group stage.  Today’s televised draw was made in Nyon,  Switzerland ,
where European soccer’s governing body is based.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
