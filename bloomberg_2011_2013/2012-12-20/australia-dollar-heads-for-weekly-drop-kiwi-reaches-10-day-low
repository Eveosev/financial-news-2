The Australian dollar headed for the
first weekly loss versus its U.S. peer this month as Prime
Minister Julia Gillard said a budget surplus for the fiscal year
is unlikely and risk appetite ebbed on concern U.S. leaders are
struggling to resolve a budget showdown.  The Aussie has weakened on concern the South Pacific
nation’s economy is slowing and may be in store for further
interest-rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of  Australia . New
Zealand’s currency reached the lowest in more than a week versus
the greenback after the nation’s economy grew more slowly than
forecast and data showed business confidence slipped.  Australia’s currency was little changed at $1.0483
yesterday in New York, headed for a weekly loss of 0.4 percent,
its first since the five days ended Nov. 30. The currency traded
at 88.44 yen.  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, touched 83.19
U.S. cents, the weakest since Dec. 10, before trading at 83.39.
It traded at 70.37 yen.  Gillard staked her economic credibility partly on
delivering the first surplus since the 2009 global recession.
Threatening the commitment is a weaker international outlook,
lower prices of commodity exports and a high local dollar that’s
hurting non-resource industries such as tourism and
manufacturing. The RBA cut the key interest rate to 3 percent on
Dec. 3, from 3.25 percent.  GDP, Budget  New Zealand’s GDP rose 0.2 percent in the three months
ended Sept. 30 from the previous quarter, the statistics bureau
said. A Bloomberg News survey of economists forecast a 0.4
percent gain. Data from ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd. showed 22.7
percent of companies expect the economy will improve over the
next 12 months, versus 26.4 percent in November.  The stalled U.S. budget talks won’t be resolved until the
last week of 2012 or early in 2013 with negotiations between the
White House and Congress at a standstill as lawmakers plan to
leave  Washington  for the Christmas holiday. More than $600
billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases are set to
go into effect if an agreement isn’t reached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
