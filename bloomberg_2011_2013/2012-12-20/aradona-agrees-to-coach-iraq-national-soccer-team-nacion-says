Diego Maradona , who led Argentina to
the 1986 World Cup title as a player, accepted an offer to coach
Iraq’s national soccer club, newspaper La Nacion said.  Maradona accepted the proposal and the Iraqi soccer
federation will determine final terms for a contract, the Buenos
Aires-based  newspaper said , citing businessman Hernan Tofoni,
who La Nacion said is brokering the hiring.  Maradona, 52, managed Argentina in the 2010 World Cup in
 South Africa , where the team was knocked out in the
quarterfinals after a 4-0 loss to Germany. He was appointed
manager of Dubai-based Al Wasl soccer club last year and fired
in July in his longest tenure as a club coach.  He was captain of Argentina’s team in 1986 when the South
American country beat West Germany 3-2 in the  World Cup  final.
Maradona was voted player of the century in 2000 in a poll
organized by soccer governing body FIFA.  Iraq, currently managed by former Brazilian star Zico, is
in the 92nd slot in FIFA’s  ranking  of national teams.  To contact the reporters on this story:
