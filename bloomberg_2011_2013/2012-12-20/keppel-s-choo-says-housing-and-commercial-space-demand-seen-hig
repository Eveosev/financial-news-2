Keppel Corp.’s Chief Executive
Officer Choo Chiau Beng expects demand for residential and
office demand will remain high in  Singapore . He spoke in a
Bloomberg Television interview on Dec. 17.  On housing demand:  “One of the reasons why Singapore property prices have
gone up is that we have limited land and you have a population
that went up by 1 million in the last 10 years. What do you
expect?  “I would say that landed prices will likely remain strong.  “As long as Singapore attracts good quality businesses in
Singapore, there will be demand.”  On office space:  “In Singapore, there’s still need for office space. The
office space still has reasonable value of about S$10 per square
foot a month. In the last boom, it went as high as S$18. So we
haven’t reached that level yet.  “It will remain at this level for some time because many
of these companies have hired with long business plan.”
