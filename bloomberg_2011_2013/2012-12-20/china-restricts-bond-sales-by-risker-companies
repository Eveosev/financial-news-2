China ’s top economic planning agency
said it will restrict bond sales by companies with high levels
of debt as authorities seek to limit default risks.  The  National Development and Reform Commission  said it
won’t approve bond sales by companies with liability-to-asset
ratios higher than 90 percent and that have a “relatively
high” risk of not being able to repay debt, according to a
statement posted on the agency’s website yesterday.  China has sought to expand its  bond market  to wean
companies off a dependence on bank loans and to give smaller
companies more fundraising options by allowing them to sell
debt. That growth in China’s bond market, where no company has
yet defaulted on a publicly-traded debt, has spurred concern
that some issuers may have difficulty repaying borrowings.  Harbin Huijiabei Foods Co., a company that sold a
collective bond with three other companies in 2010, said
yesterday it won’t be able to deposit its payable principal and
interest to a reserve account on time, according to a statement
posted on Chinabond, the nation’s bond clearinghouse. The yield
on the bond last traded at 17.7 percent, up from 9 percent in
February, according to Chinabond.  The NDRC said yesterday companies that have sold bonds are
forbidden from guaranteeing other companies’ debts. The agency
also called for credit rating companies not to give artificially
high ratings.  The NDRC, China’s central bank and the nation’s securities
regulator all approve debt sales in the nation.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
