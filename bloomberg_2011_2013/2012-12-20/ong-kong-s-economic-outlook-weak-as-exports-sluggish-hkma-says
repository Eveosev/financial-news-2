Hong Kong near-term economic outlook
is “relatively weak” because of sluggish export demand, the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority said.  The economy faces “downside risks, particularly for the
external environment,” the de-facto central bank said yesterday
in a  report  by its research department. “The latest reading of
our in-house composite index of leading indicators also points
to continued soft growth in the months ahead.”  Hong Kong’s economy is set for its weakest annual expansion
since the global financial crisis as the European sovereign debt
crisis damps global trade. The government in November cut its
estimate for full-year growth to 1.2 percent from an August
projection of a range of 1 percent to 2 percent.  The HKMA also reiterated concerns about the city’s
“overheating” property market, as low interest rates encourage
households to borrow excessively.  Home prices  in Hong Kong, the world’s most expensive place
to buy an apartment, have doubled in the past four years and
surpassed a previous peak in 1997, on near record-low mortgage
rates and an increase in buyers from other parts of  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
