Lithuania’s parliament revoked the
immunity from prosecution of the leader of the  Labor Party , part
of the ruling coalition formed last month, so a court in the
Baltic nation may continue the lawmaker’s trial for fraud.  Parliamentarians voted 86-29 today with 15 abstentions to
lift the immunity of Viktor Uspaskich as requested by the
General Prosecutor’s Office, according to a broadcast on the
Vilnius-based chamber’s website. The motion required 71 votes in
the 141-member legislature to pass.  Premier Algirdas Butkevicius, who included Labor in his
four-party government despite protests by President Dalia Grybauskaite, encouraged his Social Democrats to let the
coalition partners stand trial. Uspaskich, a Russian-born
entrepreneur, insisted the charges were political.  “It’s a disgrace that this case has dragged out for six
years already,” Butkevicius said in an interview on Ziniu Radio
before the vote. That was due to both inefficiencies in the
legal system and deliberate delays by Labor, he said.  Separate votes on revoking the immunity of two other Labor
members, First Deputy Speaker Vytautas Gapsys and Vitalija
Vonzutaite of the Budget and Finance Committee, are scheduled
for later today. A Vilnius court is trying them together with
Uspaskich on charges of accounting fraud for the party between
2004 and 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
