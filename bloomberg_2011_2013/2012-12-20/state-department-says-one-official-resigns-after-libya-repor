An assistant secretary in charge of
diplomatic security resigned and three other officials were
placed on administrative leave after an independent panel held
them partly responsible for lax security at the Libya mission
that was attacked, a State Department spokeswoman said.  The State Department accepted the resignation of Eric
Boswell, the assistant secretary for diplomatic security,
effective immediately, spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland  said today in
a statement. The other three officials, whom she didn’t name,
have been relieved of their current duties, she said.  The report of the Accountability Review Board, appointed by
Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , found “grossly inadequate”
security at the U.S. mission in Libya before a deadly attack by
militants on Sept. 11 that killed four Americans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
