Donald Gimbel, senior managing 
director at Carret Asset Management, says once the so-called 
fiscal cliff is resolved, he expects to invest in countries 
outside the U.S., like China, or in large U.S. corporations that
can take advantage of growth in the rest of the world. Gimbel 
talks with Bloomberg's  Kathleen Hays  and Vonnie Quinn on 
Bloomberg Radio's "The Hays Advantage."   (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 18:59
