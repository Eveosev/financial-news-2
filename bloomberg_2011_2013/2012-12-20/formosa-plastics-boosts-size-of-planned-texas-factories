Formosa Plastics Group (1301) ,  Taiwan ’s
biggest diversified industrial company, filed applications for
two Texas chemical plants that proposed larger capacities than
previously announced.  Its ethylene plant in Point Comfort, about 120 miles
southwest of Houston, will be capable of producing 1.15 million
short tons (1.04 million metric tons) a year, the company’s
Formosa Plastics Corp. USA unit said in an  application  submitted
Dec. 11 to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. That’s 30
percent larger than what the company  said  in February.  An adjacent propylene plant will have a capacity of 725,000
short tons, according to an application for an air-emissions
 permit  received by EPA. That’s 10 percent more than what the
company said in February.  Formosa has joined Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., Exxon
Mobil Corp. and  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  in seeking to build the first
new U.S. ethylene plants since 2001. Hydraulic fracturing has
increased supplies of natural gas liquids such as ethane and
propane, which are converted to ethylene and propylene for use
in plastics and textiles.  Formosa said in February it will invest more than $1.7
billion to build the two factories and a polyethylene plastics
plant at the site creating 225 long-term jobs. Kelly Burn, a
Formosa spokeswoman, didn’t immediately respond to a call today
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
