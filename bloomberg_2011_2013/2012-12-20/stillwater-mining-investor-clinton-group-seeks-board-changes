Stillwater Mining Co. (SWC)  investor
Clinton Group Inc. called for the retirement of Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Frank McAllister and changes to the
board of directors at the company, a producer of platinum-group
metals in  Montana .  Stillwater’s board and management team have made a “series
of strategic missteps and bad acquisitions,” New York-based
Clinton Group said in a statement today. Stillwater should
reassess plans for projects in  Canada  and Argentina, it said in
a letter sent to the Stillwater board.  Stillwater has declined 41 percent in the past 24 months.
The company, based in Billings, Montana, bought Peregrine Metals
Ltd. last year for $262.9 million to add the Altar copper and
gold project in  Argentina  and acquired Marathon PGM Corp. for
C$134.7 million ($136.4 million) in 2010.  Mike Beckstead, a company spokesman, didn’t immediately
return calls seeking comment.  “It is time for Mr. McAllister to retire and to be
replaced by a proven executive with a commitment to operating
the Montana mines efficiently and to ridding the company of its
prospecting and speculative investments in Canada and
Argentina,” Clinton Group Managing Director Gregory Taxin said
in the letter to Stillwater’s board.  “In the absence of movement on these items, you should
expect that we will take our case to Stillwater shareholders
this spring,” Taxin said in the letter.  Clinton Group  owned  0.5 percent of Stillwater as of Sept.
30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
