NCsoft Corp. (036570)  led South Korean
gamemaker shares lower in Seoul stock trading on speculation the
government will continue to regulate the industry.  NCsoft, a producer of online games, slumped 6.1 percent to
147,500 won, its steepest drop since Dec. 5.  NHN Corp. (035420) , the
country’s biggest Internet search-engine operator, declined 6.3
percent to 216,500 won.  Gamevil Inc. (063080)  tumbled 14 percent to
90,300 won, the biggest loss since Aug. 19, 2011, while  Neowiz
Games Corp. (095660)  sank 7.7 percent to 22,250 won, the lowest close
since Dec. 7. The benchmark  Kospi index  added 0.3 percent.  Park Geun Hye, South Korea’s newly elected president, was
reported by MoneyToday on Dec. 5 as supporting a shutdown system
for mobile games, which would would prevent students from
playing games after midnight. Park, 60, of the ruling New
Frontier Party, defeated main opposition nominee Moon Jae In in
yesterday’s election.  “Investors are betting the current government’s regulatory
pressure on the  game industry  will continue after Park’s
victory,” Choi Hoon, an analyst at KB Investment & Securities
Co., said by phone today.  NHN shares still “seem expensive,” while there are some
concerns the company may struggle to succeed in the mobile game
business overseas, Jeong Woo Cheol, an analyst at Mirae Asset
Securities Co., said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
