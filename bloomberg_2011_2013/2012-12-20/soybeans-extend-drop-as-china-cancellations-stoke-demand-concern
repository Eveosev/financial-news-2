Wheat fell below $8 a bushel for the
first time since July 3 in Chicago amid concerns of a lack of
export demand and as snow in the central U.S. and a jump in
German plantings boosted the outlook for production next year.  Egypt ’s state grain buyer bought 120,000 metric tons of
U.S. soft red winter wheat yesterday, less than half the 280,000
tons of U.S. wheat purchased in a Dec. 1 tender.  “People expected more” from Egypt, said Cedric Weber, an
analyst at farm adviser Offre & Demande Agricole, by phone from
Bourges,  France . “The U.S. wheat exports have been bearish. You
need three to four weeks of a good export pace from the U.S.
before the market can really improve.”  Wheat for March delivery fell as much as 1.7 percent to
$7.9175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest since
July 3 and paring this year’s advance to 21 percent. The
contract traded at $7.9275 at 1:27 p.m. Paris time.  Milling wheat for delivery in March fell as much as 2.3
percent to 247.50 euros ($328) a ton, the lowest since July 12,
and traded at 247.75 euros on NYSE Liffe in the French capital
recently. The grain has climbed 27 percent this year.  U.S. wheat export sales from June 1 through to Dec. 13
totaled 492.1 million bushels, down 13 percent from 567.2
million tons in the year-earlier period, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture reported this week.  Plains Snow  Snow in the U.S. Plains and increased sowing of winter
wheat in  Germany , the European Union’s second-biggest grower,
are improving production prospects for 2013, according to Weber.  Blizzard conditions were forecast to drop 2 inches to 5
inches (5 centimeters to 13 centimeters) of snow in the Central
Plains last night and today, according to Commodity Weather
Group. German winter wheat planting jumped 7.1 percent to an
estimated 3.1 million hectares, the government reported.  Soybeans dropped for a fourth day to the lowest price in
more than three weeks on concern demand for U.S. supplies may
weaken after  China  canceled some orders, and as growing
conditions improve in Brazil.  The oilseed for March delivery fell as much as 1 percent to
$14.165 a bushel in  Chicago , the cheapest for the most-active
contract since Nov. 23. Soybeans were at $14.2375 recently, 18
percent higher this year.  U.S. Exports  Export sales from the U.S., the largest grower and shipper
last year, probably fell to 400,000 to 1 million tons in the
week to Dec. 13, from 1.3 million tons a week earlier, according
to a Bloomberg survey of five analysts. China, the largest
buyer, canceled 300,000 tons for shipment before Sept. 1, the
USDA said on Dec. 18. The USDA will release the latest export
sales data today in  Washington .  “The trade continued to reel from the export
cancellations,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte, said in a report today. “Near-term conditions in  Brazil 
look generally good,” boosting crop prospects, he said.  Croplands from Brazil’s Parana to Sao Paolo and Mato Grosso
do Sul will have showers and thunderstorms over the next few
days, maintaining soil moisture, Accuweather.com said in a
forecast yesterday.  Corn for delivery in March fell as much as 1.4 percent to
$6.93 a bushel, the lowest price for the most-active contract
since July 11, and was at $6.9325 in recent trading. Futures,
which surged to a record $8.49 in August, are up 7.2 percent
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
