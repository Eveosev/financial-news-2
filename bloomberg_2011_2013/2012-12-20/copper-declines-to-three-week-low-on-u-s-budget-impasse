Copper futures fell for a fourth day
in New York, capping the longest string of declines since
October, as signs that U.S. budget talks are faltering dimmed
prospects for economic growth and metals demand.  The White House is rejecting House Speaker  John Boehner ’s
“Plan B,” and warned business leaders yesterday that talks to
avert more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts
set to start in January are regressing. The index of U.S.
leading indicators fell in November, pointing to a slowdown in
the economy early next year as companies curb investment and
global growth cools.  “We’re still not seeing much movement toward a resolution
in the budget talks, and that’s working to keep metals prices
lower,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc.
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Copper futures for March delivery dropped 1.9 percent to
$3.536 a pound at 1:11 p.m. on the Comex in  New York  after
touching $3.523 a pound, the lowest since Nov. 28. The metal
hasn’t fallen for four straight sessions since Oct. 29. Prices
are up 2.9 percent this year.  Comex copper fell below its 100-day and 200-day moving
averages, a bearish signal to analysts who study historical
price patterns.  Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange expanded
for an 11th session to 311,925 metric tons, the longest rising
streak since January 2011.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months slumped 2
percent to $7,770 a ton ($3.52 a pound).  Aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and tin also fell in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
