Mikaela Shiffrin became the second-
youngest U.S. skier to win a World Cup alpine race, capturing a
slalom event at Are,  Sweden , to take the lead in the season’s
standings.  The 17-year-old from Eagle-Vail, Colorado, is three months
older than Judy Nagel was when she took a giant slalom in La
Parva,  Chile , in 1967, according to the U.S. Ski Team’s website.  Shiffrin, who twice finished third in World Cup slaloms
events during the last year, entered her second run trailing
Frida Hansdotter of Sweden by 0.15 seconds. Shiffrin finished
with a combined time of 1 minute, 45.36 seconds, beating
Hansdotter, the runner-up, by 0.29.  “I was just trying to fly,” Shiffrin said in a release on
the team’s website. “I don’t know what to say. I just want to
hug my mom a lot. Right now I just need to try to calm down and
regroup.”  Tina Maze  of Slovenia was third in 1:45.88 to strengthen
her lead over Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany in the overall World
Cup standings. Maze has 919 points and Hoefl-Riesch has 532,
finishing 11th today.  Shiffrin now leads the slalom standings with 196 points, 22
more than Hoefl-Riesch. She’s 11th in the overall rankings.  Lindsey Vonn , the defending overall champion from the U.S.,
is taking a break from skiing to regain strength after being
hospitalized last month with a stomach infection. Vonn remains
fourth overall with 414 points, trailing Maze by 505.  To contact the reporter on this story:
