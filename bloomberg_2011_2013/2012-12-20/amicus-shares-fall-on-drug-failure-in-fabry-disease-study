Amicus Therapeutics Inc. (FOLD)  shares fell
the most ever after the company said its experimental treatment
for Fabry disease failed in a clinical trial.  Amicus dropped 47 percent to $3.06 at 4 p.m. New York time,
the  biggest  one-day drop since it began trading in 2007. Amicus,
based in Cranbury, New Jersey, is developing the treatment with
London-based drugmaker  GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK)  The shares have
fallen 11 percent this year.  Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder in which patients
can’t break down fats that accumulate in the body’s organs. A
six-month result from the 67-patient trial showed that the
experimental drug didn’t perform better than a placebo, Amicus
and Glaxo said today in a statement. The study, in the third and
final stage of testing typically required for regulatory
approval, will continue for a full year, the companies said.  No serious adverse events were reported in the clinical
trial, the companies said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
