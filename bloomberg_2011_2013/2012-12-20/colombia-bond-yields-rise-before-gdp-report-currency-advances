Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose
before a government report that is forecast to show the economy
grew at the slowest pace in two years in the third quarter,
damping demand for the debt.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
securities due in July 2024 rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.9 percent at 9:57 a.m. in Bogota,
according to the stock exchange. The peso rose 0.1 percent to
1,789.06 per dollar, bringing its gain this year to 8.4 percent.  “People will be watching for the report to get a better
sense if the central bank will need to cut rates further,”
Eduardo Bolanos, an analyst at Asesores en Valores brokerage in
Bogota, said in a phone interview.  Policy makers last month unexpectedly lowered the  overnight
lending rate  by a quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent to
boost a slowing economy. Banco de la Republica will lower the
benchmark to 4.25 percent on Dec. 21, according to three of 31
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest project the target
rate will hold steady.  The economy expanded 3.9 percent in the third quarter from
a year ago, according to the median estimate of 28 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the lowest since the third
quarter of 2010. The national statistics agency is slated to
publish the gross domestic product report at 11 a.m. in Bogota.  To contact the reporter on this story:
