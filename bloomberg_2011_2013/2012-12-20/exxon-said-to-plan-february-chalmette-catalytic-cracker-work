Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  will shut a fluid
catalytic cracker at the Chalmette, Louisiana,  refinery  in
February for maintenance, according to a person with knowledge
of the situation.  An alkylation unit will also be shut during the work, which
is scheduled to begin Feb. 24 and last about a month, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isnâ€™t public.  Rachael Moore, a Fairfax, Virginia-based spokeswoman for
Exxon, declined to comment in an e-mail.  The plant has a capacity of 200,700 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
