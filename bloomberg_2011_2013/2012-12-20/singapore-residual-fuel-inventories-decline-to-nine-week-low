Residual-fuel inventories in
 Singapore , Asia’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
2.7 percent to the lowest level in nine weeks, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen dropped 553,000 barrels to 20
million barrels in the seven days to yesterday,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s
the lowest level since the week ended Oct. 17.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene rose 296,000 barrels, or 3 percent, to 10.2
million barrels, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the third
increase in four weeks.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate were up 489,000 barrels, or 5.4 percent, at 9.6
million barrels, according to the data. Supplies rebounded from
a seven-week low.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
