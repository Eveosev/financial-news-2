Argentina ,  South America ’s largest
wheat producer, is cutting its forecast for the current crop and
halting exports to ensure domestic supply as excess rain, heat
and fungal diseases harm crops, a government official said.  The forecast is being cut to 10.5 million metric tons from
11.1 million estimated last month, Oscar Solis, an
undersecretary at the  Agriculture Ministry  said in a telephone
interview from Buenos Aires today. The government is suspending
exports until the end of next month to avoid a domestic
shortage, he said.  The governments of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
and her predecessor and husband Nestor Kirchner have limited
exports of wheat, soybeans and other agricultural commodities in
past years in a bid to avoid shortages and price increases,
causing conflicts with growers’ associations.  “We’ve always said that we’re a government that aims to
privilege the local consumer,” Solis said of the exports
suspension. “We’re not changing the rules of the game.”  Wheat for March delivery fell 1.9 percent to $7.905 a
bushel at 7:50 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat futures
have dropped 10 percent in the past three months.  Some ships that have already been loaded with wheat may be
allowed to depart from Argentine ports, Solis said.  The government plans to release a report with the new
forecast between today and tomorrow, he said.  Harvesting for the current 2012-13 season started in
November and normally runs through January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
