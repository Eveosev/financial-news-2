At the height of Ireland’s real- estate boom five years ago, Mervyn Chamney failed with an 8 million-euro ($11 million) bid for land 16 miles from Dublin. Last month, he bought the site for about 550,000 euros.  “I was lucky that I was an unsuccessful bidder,” the 40- year-old said in an interview two days ago. “If I’d been successful, I would be ruined today.”  Chamney, who stayed solvent because he only ended up losing money in the stock market rather than owing banks millions, expects to get a quick return from the 4.5 acres (1.8 hectares) and the unfinished homes in Blessington, Wicklow, after already taking deposits on five agreed sales.  Bargain hunters like Chamney are joining U.S. firms in sifting through the debris of western  Europe ’s worst banking crisis. In the last three months,  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , Apollo Global Management and  Gordon Brothers  Group LLC have bought property, while New York-based securities firm  Cantor Fitzgerald  LP acquired Dublin-based Dolmen Stockbrokers.

With the exception of  Greece , Irish  house prices  fell the most among 55 countries in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, according to Knight Frank LLP. Irish total commercial property returns are the worst in Europe in the five years through 2011, according to Investment Property Databank Ltd., a research company in  London .  Investors also still face risks as the economy struggles to recover from the worst recession in its modern history.  The  Finance Ministry  last month cut its growth forecast for next year and 2014. The  economy  expanded 0.2 percent in the third quarter, down from 0.4 percent in the second, the statistics agency said two days ago.  The economy’s weakness has hurt Dublin’s office property market, where the vacancy rate is about 18 percent, according to property broker Jones Lang LaSalle. That compares with a rate of 23.7 percent at the market’s low point in the final quarter of 2010. In 1999, the rate was about 2 percent.  Averting Collapse  The government was forced to seek an international bailout in 2010, as its banks flirted with collapse. Last year, the central bank ordered the remaining banks to sell and run down about 70 billion euros of loans by the end of 2013.  Central bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said in September that too many businesses haven’t yet recovered from the crash and need to be overhauled, warning banks of “procrastination” in “cleaning up the post-crisis mess.”  Ireland’s parliament passed new personal insolvency legislation yesterday aimed at helping borrowers find a way out of indebtedness. That includes potential write-offs for home owners facing difficulties repaying mortgages, Justice Minister Alan Shatter said in a statement.  “A lot of the time, there is a viable underlying business that is generating a profit, but there is a massive property- related debt, so it might make a profit for the next 30 years but still won’t be able to repay its debt,” said David Van Dessel, a partner at  Kavanaghfennell , which specializes in insolvencies. “We are still in the zone of forbearance.”  Hotel Purchase  Blackstone bought the 501-bedroom Burlington Hotel in Dublin for 67 million euros in November from  Grant Thornton , which was acting on behalf of Lloyds. That’s less than a quarter of the 288 million euros an Irish real-estate developer paid in 2007. The New York-based firm will spend 16 million euros refurbishing the hotel and may do more deals in Ireland after commercial real estate prices dropped by more than 60 percent.  “We are hopeful to find additional investment opportunities here as well,” Ken Caplan, head of European real estate at Blackstone, said in a statement on Nov. 25 , the day the transaction was announced.  Apollo paid 149 million pounds ($242 million) last month for Irish commercial property loans from Lloyds with a face value of 1.47 billion pounds. The London-based  bank , which has taken about 12 billion pounds of charges on Irish loans since 2007, based on data compiled by Bloomberg, moved in 2010 to close and run down its operation in Ireland.  Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc., (KW)  based in  Beverly Hills ,  California , said today it acquired with a partner a loan with an unpaid balance of 120 million euros that’s secured by a Dublin office building and an adjacent three-acre site.  Farmland  While overseas buyers are targeting trophy properties or portfolios of loans, some domestic ones are aiming for cheaper assets, taking advantage of the slump in prices.  “Some people got out before the crash,” Brian O’Reilly, an investment strategist at Dublin-based Davy, Ireland’s largest securities firm, told reporters at a press briefing on Dec. 10. “We’ve seen farmers who sold their land at the height of the boom looking to buy their land back.”  Four weeks ago, Davy hosted a private dinner in Richard Corrigan’s Mayfair restaurant in London for investors interested in buying Irish real estate. About 30 wealthy individuals and representatives of family offices showed up, O’Reilly said.  The reason for the influx is simple: income. Overall, Irish offices yield about 7 percent, compared with 4 percent in the  West End  of London, according to CBRE Group Inc., a commercial real estate services firm.  Four office blocks at  Allied Irish Banks Plc’s (ALBK)  headquarters in south Dublin sold to a European syndicate of investors this year at a yield of 9.6 percent, CBRE said.  Clerys Store  It’s not just real estate. In September, Gordon Brothers bought Clerys department store on Dublin’s main O’Connell Street from receivers appointed by Bank of Ireland Plc.  Cantor Fitzgerald bought Dolmen Stockbrokers, which caters to private clients and pension funds, for an undisclosed price. The company plans to make money from selling products based on bank debt through the brokerage, Cantor Chief Executive Officer Shawn Matthews said in an e-mail.  “We see an opportunity in the aftermath of the Irish housing bust through repackaging mortgages into securities to get them off troubled lenders’ books,” he said. “Ireland is turning the corner, but it still faces challenges. Part of the solution lies in getting money moving.”  About 25 percent of all residential loans by value, including buy-to-let, were at least three months in arrears or had been restructured at the end of June, according to Bloomberg News calculations based on central bank data. That’s up from 22.5 percent at the end of the second quarter.  Back in Blessington, Mervyn Chamney is undeterred. Even without advertising, houses on the estate are selling.  “We’ve done a lot of work to take the abandoned look of the site,” said Chamney. “People just need confidence that somebody has taken over. That’s all.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Finbarr Flynn in Dublin at  fflynn2@bloomberg.net .
