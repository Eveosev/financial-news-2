Robert Griffin III will be back at
quarterback for the Washington Redskins this week barring any
setbacks with his sprained right knee, coach  Mike Shanahan  said.  Griffin yesterday had a full practice for the second
straight day ahead of the Redskins’ Dec. 23 road game against
the Philadelphia Eagles. He sat out a 38-21 victory in Cleveland
four days ago, when Washington pushed its National Football
League winning streak to five games.  “If there’s no setback, doctors feel he’ll be ready to
go,” Shanahan said at a news conference. “There was no setback
today, so that’s a good sign.”  The Redskins are in a three-way tie atop the National
Football Conference’s Eastern division at 8-6 with the  New York 
Giants and  Dallas Cowboys . Washington could clinch a playoff
berth this week with a win in Philadelphia and losses by the
Giants,  Chicago Bears  and Minnesota Vikings.  The second overall pick in this year’s NFL draft, Griffin
has passed for 2,902 yards with 18 touchdowns and four
interceptions in helping the Redskins rebound from a 3-6 start.
He’s also set a rookie record for quarterbacks with 748 rushing
yards and run for six more scores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
