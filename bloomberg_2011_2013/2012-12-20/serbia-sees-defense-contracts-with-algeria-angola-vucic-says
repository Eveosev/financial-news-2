Serbia expects “hundreds of
millions of euros” over the next two years from defense and
construction contracts the state will arrange with the
governments of  Angola  and  Algeria , deputy premier said.  Serbian companies are to build a military hospital and
rebuild an airport in Luanda, Angola, said Aleksandar Vucic, who

construction of 15,000 apartments funded by the government of
the North African nation, Vucic told the parliament in a debate
