Gold futures fell to the lowest
since August after a report showed the  U.S. economy  grew more
than forecast last quarter, damping expectations that the
 Federal Reserve  will expand monetary stimulus.  The U.S. grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the third
quarter, more than previously reported and exceeding all
projections in a Bloomberg survey, Commerce Department figures
showed. The Fed said Dec. 12 it will boost its main stimulus
tool by adding $45 billion of monthly Treasury purchases to an
existing pledge of $40 billion in mortgage debt a month. The
program is its third round of debt buying, known as quantitative
easing, aimed at boosting expansion.  “The GDP number was better than forecast, so the thinking
is that improving conditions in the economy might mean a light
at the end of the tunnel on when the Fed will end QE3,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for February delivery fell 1.3 percent to
settle at $1,645.90 an ounce at 1:56 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , after touching $1,636, the lowest since Aug. 21. The price
is up 5 percent this year.  The metal closed below its 200-day moving average, near
$1,668, a bearish signal to some analysts who study historical
price patterns. That means gold could drop to $1,535 by the end
of the first quarter,  Dave Lutz , the head of exchange-traded
fund trading and strategy at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore,
said yesterday.  Gold Options  The most-traded gold options today on the Comex were bets
on further price declines. About 1,707 put options traded that
give owners the right to sell at $1,600 by January. That
compares with volume of 365 yesterday, exchange data show.  Prices have surged 86 percent since the end of December
2008 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and bought
debt. Bullion is heading for a 12th annual gain after central
banks from the U.S. to  China  and  Europe  took action to prop up
economies.  Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products increased
to a record 2,631.79 metric tons yesterday, data tracked by
Bloomberg show. They’ve expanded 12 percent this year.  Silver futures for March delivery tumbled 4.6 percent to
$29.678 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest loss since June.
Earlier, the metal touched $29.635, the lowest since Aug. 22.  The  ratio  of gold’s price to silver climbed to as high as
55.47, the highest since August.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery dropped 2.9 percent to $1,546.20 an ounce, a
fourth straight decline.  Palladium futures for March delivery lost 2.6 percent to
$680.25 an ounce, the biggest decline since Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
