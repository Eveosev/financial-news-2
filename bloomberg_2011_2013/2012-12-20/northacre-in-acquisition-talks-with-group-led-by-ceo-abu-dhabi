Northacre Plc (NTA) , developer of The
Lancasters luxury apartments opposite London’s Hyde Park, is in
talks to be acquired by two separate companies, one of which is
led by its Chief Executive Officer Ken MacRae.  The discussions are at an early stage and there is no
certainty of an offer, the London-based company said in a
statement today. An independent committee has been formed to
assess the offers.  MacRae is leading one of the approaches through his
management buyout company 2492 Ltd., while the other is from  Abu
Dhabi  Capital Management LLC, according to the statement.  Northacre has been unprofitable since 2008 when the British
housing market plummeted during the financial crisis. The
homebuilder is planning to build less expensive homes by
renovating office buildings to help increase returns on its
developments.  Northacre rose 26 percent in London trading to 99.5 pence
as of 4:01 p.m. That’s the biggest intraday gain since August
2010.  The Lancasters, a 77-unit redevelopment of 1850s
townhouses, helped Northacre become the second-best performing
real estate stock in  Europe  in 2010. The shares jumped by 43
percent on Aug. 11, that year when the company announced it sold
enough apartments to get a 50 percent share in the profits with
development partner Minerva Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
