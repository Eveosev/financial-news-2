Japanese stock futures and
Australian shares rose as U.S. economic growth was revised
higher and American home sales climbed to a three-year high.  American Depositary Receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese
camera maker that gets 80 percent of its sales abroad, gained
1.4 percent. Shares of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. may be active
as broadcaster NHK reported the electronic-equipment maker may
cut its profit forecast by 50 percent.  Billabong International
Ltd. (BBG)  gained 2.5 percent after Chief Financial Officer Craig
White left the Australian surf-wear maker yesterday as the board
considers a A$527 million ($553 million) takeover offer.  Futures on  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,165 in  Chicago  yesterday, up from 10,030 in
 Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,150 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained
0.3 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.1 percent, the
highest level since December 2007.  There was another “set of better-than-expected U.S.
economic data,” said Matthew Sherwood, head of markets research
at Perpetual Investment, which manages about $25 billion in
Sydney. “Even better news was evident in the revised U.S.
September quarter GDP growth figures. Waning hope for a deal to
avoid the U.S. fiscal cliff is keeping some investors on the
sidelines.”  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures were little changed
today. The gauge climbed 0.6 percent yesterday as House Speaker
John Boehner said he expects to keep working on a budget plan
with President  Barack Obama .  Tax Vote  The House is due to vote on Boehner’s plan to raise taxes
on incomes over $1 million, a plan which the White House has
said Obama would veto because he wants the threshold set at
$400,000. Boehner accused Obama of being unwilling to stand up
to fellow Democrats in the fight over how to avert spending cuts
and tax increases scheduled to begin in January.  Sales of previously owned U.S. homes climbed to a three-
year high in November, reinforcing forecasts that the industry
is set to contribute to annual economic growth for the first
time since 2005. Purchases of existing houses increased 5.9
percent to a 5.04 million annual rate, the most since November
2009, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday in
 Washington . The median forecast of 82 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg projected a 4.9 million rate.  The U.S. economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, more than previously reported, according to
Commerce Department figures released yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has risen about 13 percent this
year though yesterday as central banks around the world took
action to spur growth and on signs of recovery in the U.S. and
 China . The gauge traded at 14.7 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.9 for the S&P 500 Index and 12.8 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. climbed 0.5 percent to 97.67 in New
York, the highest closing level since May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
