Japanese stocks rose, with the  Topix
Index (TPX)  extending an eight-month high, as  Mitsubishi UFJ (8306)  Financial
Group Inc. led lenders higher after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  expanded
its asset-purchase plan the third time in four months.  Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan’s biggest bank, gained 2.3 percent to
reverse earlier declines. Tokio Marine Holdings Inc., an
insurer, rose 2.4 percent. Mitsubishi Estate Co., Japan’s
biggest developer by market value, climbed 1.5 percent.  “The BOJ decision was what the market expected but now
investors are hopeful the Liberal Democratic Party will add more
pressure to the Bank of Japan for more easing next year,” said
Hidehiro Tomioka, who helps oversee $1.2 billion at Manulife
Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. in Tokyo. “I think real change
will come after the new cabinet is formed and the government
starts moving next year.”  The Topix rose 0.4 percent to 842.56 as of 1:43 p.m. in
Tokyo after earlier dropping as much as 0.5 percent. About eight
stocks gained for every seven that fell on the 1,680 member
index. The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average fell 0.4 percent to
10,116.89 as  Fast Retailing Co. (9983)  and Softbank Corp., the top
three most heavily weighted stocks on the gauge, dropped.  The central bank expanded its asset-purchase fund to 76
trillion yen ($903 billion) from 66 trillion yen, according to a
statement released in Tokyo today, and kept its credit lending
program unchanged at 25 trillion yen. Some 17 or 21 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg had expected more stimulus to be announced
today.  The Nikkei 225 has risen about 16 percent since Nov. 14,
when elections were called. Shares rose on expectations the
Liberal Democratic Party, which returned to power at the polls
last weekend, will raise spending and secure more easing from
the central bank to boost the economy, as well as doubling
nation’s inflation goal to 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
