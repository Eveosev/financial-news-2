Malaysia’s ringgit dropped by the
most in almost two weeks as signs U.S. federal budget talks are
faltering reduced demand for emerging-market assets.  President  Barack Obama  will veto House Speaker  John
Boehner ’s budget proposal because it would burden the middle
class, White House Communications Director  Dan Pfeiffer  said.
Democrats and Republicans are trying to come up with a deal to
avert more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax
increases. Japan, Malaysia’s third-largest export market, said
yesterday overseas sales fell for a sixth month in November.  “There are still a lot of uncertainties in the market on
the fiscal cliff,” said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based foreign-
exchange strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “We may
see more dollar strength.”  The ringgit declined 0.2 percent, the most since Dec. 7, to
3.0610 per dollar as of 9:06 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has advanced 3.7
percent this year.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, fell seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.47 percent. It has fallen 4.03
percentage points this year.  Inflation held at 1.3 percent in November, the same as in
the previous two months and the least since February 2010,
according to a government report yesterday. The median estimate
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 1.4 percent.  Government bonds were little changed yesterday. The yield
on the 3.492 percent notes due March 2020 was steady at 3.48
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
