South Sudan ’s government sent police
reinforcements to Wau, capital of the state of Western Bahr el-
Ghazel, where it’s investigating the deaths of at least 16
people this month, a government official said.  Clashes erupted in the town yesterday following the
abduction of 28 farmers, six of whom are known to have been
killed, government spokesman Barnaba Marial Benjamin told
reporters today in Juba, the national capital.  United Nations peacekeepers are patrolling the area and
“several thousand” civilians have taken shelter at a UN camp
in Wau, Liam McDowell, a spokesman for the UN peacekeeping
mission in South  Sudan , said in a phone interview.
“Peacekeepers observed a number of fires as well as groups of
youths up to 300 strong with spears, sticks and machetes” in
Wau yesterday, he said.  Violence erupted in Wau earlier this month after
demonstrations by opponents of a plan to move the county
administrative headquarters to the town of Baggari, according to
Benjamin. Ten people were killed on Dec. 8 and 9 when the police
opened fire on the protesters, some of whom he said attempted to
loot a bank. People connected to the dead protesters then
kidnapped 28 farmers thought to be supporters of the state
government and dumped six bodies in Wau on Dec. 18, sparking
yesterday’s violence, in which six shops were destroyed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
