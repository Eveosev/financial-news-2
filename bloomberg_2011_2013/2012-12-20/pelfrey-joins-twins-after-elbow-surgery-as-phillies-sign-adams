Right-handed pitcher  Mike Pelfrey 
signed a one-year deal worth $4 million with the  Minnesota
Twins , joining the team following elbow surgery while a member
of the  New York  Mets.  Pelfrey, whose signing was announced on the Twins’ website,
pitched three games without a decision in 2012 before undergoing
the season-ending operation in May.  The 28-year-old had pitched his entire seven-year major-
league career for the Mets, going 50-54 with a 4.36 earned run
average.  Reliever Mike Adams, a right-hander who pitched for the
Texas Rangers the last two Major League Baseball seasons, signed
a two-year, $12 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies
that includes a vesting/club option for 2015, the team said in a
statement.  Adams, 34, had surgery in October for thoracic outlet
syndrome, a neck and shoulder condition that causes numbness and
tingling in the fingers. He went 5-3 with a 3.27 ERA in 61
appearances last season.  Third baseman  Placido Polanco  signed a one-year contract
with the Miami Marlins, the team said in a news release. The 37-
year-old’s .257 batting average last season for the Philadelphia
Phillies was his lowest since 1998, his first year in the
majors. Financial details weren’t released. The Associated Press
said the contract was for $2.75 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
