Rite Aid Corp. (RAD) , the third-largest
U.S. drugstore chain, gained the most in more than three years
after forecasting better full-year results and returning to a
profit in the third quarter.  Rite Aid  rose  16 percent to $1.21 at the close in New York
for the biggest gain since August 2009. The Camp Hill,
Pennsylvania-based company’s shares have lost 4 percent this
year.  The retailer, which operates more than 4,600 stores in 31
states, cited strong prescription growth and higher pharmacy
gross margin from the introduction of new generic medications in
its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 1.  “We have reached a significant milestone in our turnaround
efforts by returning to profitability,” Chief Executive Officer
John Standley said in a statement.  The chain forecast a net loss of 5 cents a share to net
income of 3 cents for fiscal 2013, according to the statement.
Rite Aid had previously  projected  a net loss of 23 cents to 9
cents a share. That compared to an average estimate for a loss
of 15 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The pharmacy retailer also said today that third-quarter
net income was $61.9 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with
a loss of $52 million, or 6 cents, last year as front-end sales
and prescription counts increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
