Munich prosecutors searched  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  offices this week for evidence that former management
board members gave false testimony in a civil suit tied to the
2002 demise of the late Leo Kirch’s media group.  Munich prosecutors overseeing the proceedings since 2011
searched the lender’s Frankfurt headquarters yesterday,
Christian Streckert, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said by
telephone. “The bank is still convinced that the allegations
raised more than a year ago will be proven unfounded.”  Kirch, who died in July, had said Deutsche Bank secretly
planned in 2002 to damage his reputation in an effort to exert
pressure on him.  Deutsche Bank was found partially liable over the collapse
of the media group and must pay damages, the Munich Higher
Regional Court said Dec. 14. The court ruled the lender and
former chief executive officer Rolf Breuer are liable for
statements in 2002 before the Kirch group filed for bankruptcy.
The late media magnate’s heirs are seeking as much as 2 billion
euros ($2.7 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
