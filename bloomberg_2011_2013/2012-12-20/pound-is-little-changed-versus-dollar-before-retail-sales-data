The pound approached the strongest
level in three months against the dollar before a report that
economists said will show retail sales rebounded in November,
supporting policy makers’ decision to pause stimulus.  Sterling climbed against most of its 16 major peers. Sales
including fuel increased 0.4 percent last month, after sliding
0.8 percent in October, the  Office for National Statistics  will
say today, according to the median forecast of 22 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey. Ten-year  gilt  yields were within three
basis points of the highest level since May.  “It’s definitely showing resilience,” said Lee McDarby,
head of dealing on the corporate and institutional treasury desk
at Investec Bank Plc in  London . “We’ve got retail sales coming
up, and if they come out firm enough, we could maybe see cable
pushing again toward that $1.63 level,” he said, referring to
sterling’s rate against the dollar.  The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.6267 at 9:08 a.m. London
time, after rising to $1.6307 yesterday, the highest since Sept.
21. The U.K. currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 81.30 pence per
euro.  Bank of England  policy makers voted 8-1 to pause their
asset-buying program at 375 billion pounds as risks from the
euro-area crisis ease and inflation concerns persist, the
minutes of their Dec. 5-6 meeting released yesterday showed.  The pound has gained 1.7 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 1.2 percent and
the dollar fell 3.3 percent.  The  10-year gilt yield  was little changed at 1.96 percent
after rising to 1.99 percent yesterday, the highest since May
10. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 dropped 0.03, or
30 pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to 98.15.  Gilts returned 1.6 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.7 percent and Treasuries earned 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
