Hungary had its credit-rating
outlook raised to stable from negative by  Fitch Ratings , which
cited the government’s commitment to narrowing the  budget
deficit .  Fitch kept Hungary’s long-term rating at BB+, its highest
junk grade and on par with Macedonia, according to a statement
today from  London .  Standard & Poor’s  lowered Hungary’s rating to
two steps below investment grade on Nov. 23, citing government
policies that are eroding economic-growth prospects. Moody’s
Investors Service rates it one level higher.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  introduced a slew of new taxes,
including special levies on the banking and telecommunication
industries, to keep the budget shortfall below 3 percent of
economic output and avoid losing European Union development
funds. The government forecasts a 2.7 percent fiscal deficit for
the next two years, while the EU sees it at 2.9 percent in 2013
and 3.5 percent in 2014.  The revision “is underpinned by progress in reducing the
budget deficit and stabilizing government debt along with
improved fiscal and external financing conditions,” Matteo Napolitano, a London-based director at Fitch, wrote in the
statement.  The forint gained as much as 0.4 percent after the
announcement and traded 0.2 percent stronger at 285.71 per euro
as of 5:15 p.m. in Budapest. Yields on the government’s
benchmark 10-year forint-denominated bonds fell 13 basis points,
or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.196 percent, the lowest in seven
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
