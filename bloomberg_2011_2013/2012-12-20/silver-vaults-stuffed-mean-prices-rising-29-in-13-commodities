Silver Bullion Pte, one of
 Singapore ’s largest suppliers of coins and bars to retail
investors, says sales tripled since October, part of a global
surge in demand that drove holdings to a record.  “Our clients are worried that a major currency crisis or
mass bankruptcies would occur,” said Gregor Gregersen, the 36-
year-old founder of Silver Bullion, whose sales now average
about S$6 million ($4.9 million) a month. “It all has to do
with falling confidence in the heavily indebted Western
governments and financial institutions.”  Global investment through silver-backed exchange-traded
products reached a record 18,854 metric tons in November, or
more than nine months of mine output, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Holdings are now valued at about $19.2 billion. Prices
will rise as much as 34 percent to $40.25 an ounce next year,
based on the median of 49 analyst, trader and investor estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver almost tripled since the end of 2008, lagging behind
only platinum in gains for precious metals this year as policy
makers from the U.S. to  China  to  Europe  pledged more action to
boost economies. That’s attracting investors betting that
stimulus will stoke inflation and debase currencies. It’s also
luring those wagering growth will strengthen industrial demand
for silver, 53 percent of which is used in everything from
televisions to batteries.  Hedge Funds  The metal advanced 7.6 percent this year to $29.9675,
compared with a 5.4 percent gain for gold and 11 percent rise
for platinum. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities
dropped 0.2 percent, and the MSCI All-Country World Index of
equities jumped 14 percent. Treasuries returned 1.8 percent,
according to a Bank of America Corp. index.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators increased bets on
higher prices 12-fold since the end of June, to a net 34,862
futures and options, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data show. That’s about 50 percent higher than the average over
the past five years, a period during which speculators have
never been bearish.  Equity investors also bet on higher prices. Shares of
Mexico City-based  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the largest primary silver
producer, rose 23 percent this year. The company will report a
22 percent gain in net income to a record $927.1 million in
2013, according to the mean of seven estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Coeur d’Alene Mines Corp.  in  Idaho , which gets about
65 percent of its revenue from silver, fell 4 percent to $23.18
this year and will reach $31.89 in 12 months, the average of
analysts’ predictions shows.  Deposit Boxes  Silver Bullion, which started in 2009 in a rented bedroom
with 18,000 ounces, now has 246,000 ounces (7.65 tons) stored in
vaults for customers as well as its own inventories. The company
operates from the Certis CISCO Center, home to one of
Singapore’s largest providers of safety deposit boxes. It sells
everything from 1- to 32-ounce coins and 10- to 100-ounce bars,
as well as gold, platinum and palladium.  Investors bought 1,464 tons through ETPs this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. They will probably add another 300
tons in 2013, Barclays Plc estimates. That’s less than the so-
called implied physical surplus that the bank says will reach
6,441 tons in 2013. Its analysts expect silver to average $32.50
next year, from $31.20 in 2012.  IMF Outlook  The surplus may drag prices lower should economic growth
slow because it would curb demand for  consumer goods . A car
contains as much as 30 grams and a mobile phone about 0.25 gram,
according to the Washington-based Silver Institute. While the
 International Monetary Fund  expects a 3.6 percent global
expansion in 2013, from 3.3 percent this year, the forecast was
cut twice since July.  The metal retreated 23 percent in 2008 as the global
economy tumbled into a recession.  Japan  and the 17-nation  euro
zone  are contracting again this year and the  Congressional
Budget Office  says the  U.S. economy  faces the same risk should
lawmakers fail to resolve more than $600 billion of automatic
spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to start next month.  Investors may also be dissuaded by the metal’s price
swings. Its 100-day historical volatility is almost twice as
high as gold, meaning investors are subject to bigger losses as
well as gains. Silver for immediate delivery reached a record
$49.79 in April 2011 before tumbling 35 percent in less than
three weeks.  Bullion Market  Comex silver futures are valued at about $22.6 billion,
compared with $72.4 billion for the bourse’s gold contracts,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Members of the London Bullion
Market Association handled an average of $34.7 billion of gold a
day in October, and $3.26 billion of silver.  Investors own 18,760.34 tons through ETPs, less than 1
percent below the record set on Nov. 15. Morgan Stanley predicts
they will add a further 500 tons in 2013. The bank said in a
report Dec. 6 that silver is among its top commodity picks for
next year, along with gold, corn and soybeans, because it will
be boosted by investor demand and a weaker U.S. currency.  Central banks are seeking to boost growth through printing
money, increasing investor concern the actions will debase
currencies and spur inflation.  The  Federal Reserve  said Dec. 12 it would buy $45 billion
of  Treasury securities  a month from January, adding to $40
billion a month of existing mortgage-debt purchases. Silver
jumped about 53 percent during the first round of so-called
quantitative easing from December 2008 through March 2010, twice
the gain in gold. It advanced 24 percent in the second phase
that ended in June 2011, about three times more than the other
metal. The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of debt in total.  Subway Station  The scale of intervention is a sign to some investors that
markets will be roiled once more by financial meltdowns. That’s
reflected in Silver Bullion’s sales, which reached S$38 million
in 2011, from S$700,000 in the first year of business. Orders
were also boosted by the government lifting a goods and service
tax on investment-grade gold, silver and platinum from Oct. 1.  While Gregersen’s first sale was made in a Singapore subway
station, his company is now a member of the Singapore Bullion
Market Association, with suppliers from the Perth Mint in
 Australia  to the Mexican central bank.  “There’s going to be another big crash, we are really near
it now,” said Chin Kuan Yew, a businessman and Silver Bullion
customer who sold all his properties, including his condominium,
to buy more metal. “You have on the one hand the U.S. printing
money and the European Union is on the brink of collapse.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
