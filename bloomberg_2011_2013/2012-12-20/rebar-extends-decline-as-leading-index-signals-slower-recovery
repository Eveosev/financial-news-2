Steel reinforcement-bar futures
dropped for a second day after a leading indicator for  China’s
economy  rose at a slower pace, boosting concern that demand
growth for the construction material may slow.  Rebar for delivery in May fell as much as 1.4 percent to
3,764 yuan ($604) a metric ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange,
the biggest intraday loss since Nov. 29. It ended the morning
session at 3,779 yuan.  The gauge rose 1.1 percent in November, compared with a
revised 1.6 percent gain the previous month, the New York-based
Conference Board said today. This month, futures have surged 9.2
percent to yesterday’s close, outpacing the 1.9 percent gain in
spot prices.  China  is the world’s largest steel user.  “We’ve had a rally that was largely pinned on people’s
optimistic outlook for a faster economic recovery and therefore
steel consumption,” Lv Xiaohua, an analyst at Everbright
Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “The immediate market
is not reinforcing that view.”  The  average spot price  rose 0.3 percent to 3,633  yuan  a ton
yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  Spot iron ore  at Tianjin port gained 2.4 percent to $135.50
a dry ton, the highest level since July, according to a gauge
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
