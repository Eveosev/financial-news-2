The number of Americans filing
first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments rose for
the first time in five weeks, a sign further improvement in the
labor market depends on faster economic growth.  Applications for  jobless benefits  increased by 17,000 to
361,000 in the week ended Dec. 15, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists forecast 360,000 claims, according to
the Bloomberg survey median.  The figures signal the expansion probably needs to proceed
more quickly to encourage companies to hold the line on
headcounts and step up hiring while Congress debates the
nation’s budget and tax rates. The Federal Reserve said last
week it intends to keep policy accommodative to invigorate the
economy and help sustain a decline in joblessness.  “This number gets us back into the range we’ve been in
really since the spring,” said  Omair Sharif , a U.S. economist
at RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , who forecast
claims would rise to 360,000. “We’re not waiting to see much
more improvement on the layoff side. We’re just waiting for the
hiring side to get going.”  Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 324,000 to
379,000 in the Bloomberg survey of 52 economists. The prior
week’s applications were initially reported as 343,000.  A Labor Department official today said there was “nothing
unusual” that affected today’s figures.  Third Quarter  Another report from the Commerce Department showed the
economy expanded at a revised 3.1 percent annual rate in the
third quarter after a previously reported 2.7 percent. The
revision reflected more consumer spending and a smaller trade
deficit.  Stock-index futures maintained losses after the figures,
with the contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March falling 0.1 percent to 1,432.4 at 8:48 a.m. in New York.  The four-week  moving average  of claims, a less-volatile
measure, declined to 367,750, the lowest since the end of
October, from 381,500.  The number of people  continuing  to collect jobless benefits
rose by 12,000 to 3.23 million in the week ended Dec. 8. The
continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers
receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
94,000 to 2.14 million in the week ended Dec. 1.  States, Territories  The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits
held at 2.5 percent in the week ended Dec. 8. Forty-two states
and territories reported a decrease in claims, while 10 reported
an increase.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Employers took on 146,000 workers in November, above a
median forecast that called for 85,000, according to Labor
Department figures released Dec. 7. The unemployment rate fell
to 7.7 percent, the lowest since December 2008.  A faster rate of hiring will likely depend on how lawmakers
in  Washington  resolve the so-called fiscal cliff of more than
$600 billion in tax increases and budget cuts set to start in
January. Tightening in fiscal policy is a “major risk factor”
already harming investment and hiring decisions by causing
“uncertainty” or “pessimism,” Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said at a Dec. 12 news conference. The central bank “doesn’t
have the tools” to offset that event, he said.  Federal Reserve  Fed policy makers announced they would for the first time
link the bank’s main interest rate to unemployment and inflation
and would expand an asset purchasing program in January to spur
the economy.  Modest economic growth is leading some U.S. companies to
seek cost-saving opportunities that involve trimming staff.
 Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the U.S. natural gas producer that
doubled its workforce in the past five years to expand drilling,
said Dec 14 that it’s cutting 275 jobs to reduce expenses.
