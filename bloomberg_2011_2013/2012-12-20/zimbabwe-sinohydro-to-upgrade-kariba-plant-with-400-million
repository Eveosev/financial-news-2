Sinohydro Corp. and the  Zimbabwe 
Power Co. (Pvt) Ltd. signed a $400 million agreement to upgrade
the southern African nation’s Kariba South hydroelectricity
plant, said ZPC Chairman Victor Gapare.  The renovations are expected to take four years and will
add 300 megawatts to Kariba’s approximately 750-megawatt
capacity, he told reporters in the capital, Harare, today. The
deal will allow Sinohydro to “start detailed drawings, while
the ZPC board and financial advisers  KPMG  finalize financial
arrangements,” Gapare said.  ZPC is a unit of state-owned Zesa Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.,
Zimbabwe’s monopoly power utility. Zesa can generate and import
about half of Zimbabwe’s 2,200-megawatt electricity demand.
Zimbabwe needs $5 billion to $7 billion to increase power
generation, Gapare said.  “It becomes incumbent on the nation to put in place an
investment climate that will enable the attraction of capital to
carry out these projects,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
