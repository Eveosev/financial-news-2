The European Union said it will fund
the bulk of a 46 million-euro ($61 million) renewable-energy and
water desalination plant in  Djibouti .  The EU will provide 40.5 million euros for the facility,
which will supply energy and water to about 200,000 people, a
quarter of the population, according to a  statement  published on
the EUbusiness website. Water availability in Djibouti’s
capital, Djibouti City, where three-quarters of the country’s
people live, is less than half the amount required, it said.  EU Development Commissioner Andris Piebalgs announced the
funding with Djiboutian Prime Minister Dileita Mohamed Dileita,
EUbusiness said.  Djibouti, a Horn of Africa nation about the size of
 Massachusetts , has a $1.1 billion economy that relies on
services related to its strategic location on the Red Sea, one
of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, according to the U.S.
State Department. The country hosts about 2,500 U.S. military
personnel at the Camp Lemonnier military base.  To contact the reporter on this story:
