Diesel fuel  gained for the first
time in more than two weeks in Chicago after inventories of
distillate products in the region were at the lowest seasonal
level since 2006, according to a report yesterday.  Stockpiles of distillates including heating oil and diesel
were  25.4 million  barrels in the Midwest in the week ended Dec.
14, the Energy Department said in a weekly report yesterday.
Supplies of motor fuel were 49.9 million barrels in the region.  The discount for  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel in the
Chicago region narrowed by 1 cent to 7.5 cents a gallon versus
heating oil futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:40
p.m. The discount for the  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the U.S.
 Gulf Coast  gained 3 cents to 3 cents below futures.  Distillate inventories  nationwide  dropped 1.09 million
barrels to 117 million, led by a decline of 2.65 million on the
Gulf Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
