Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the largest
manager of private-equity property funds, promoted Tyler Henritze and Tuhin Parikh to senior managing directors,
increasing the number of partners in real estate to 18.  Henritze joined New York-based Blackstone in 2004 and
worked on acquisitions including Equity Office Properties Trust
in 2007, Extended Stay Inc. in 2010 and the Motel 6 budget chain
this year. Parikh, who joined the firm in 2007, oversees
property investments in India, where Blackstone has been
stepping up acquisitions with plans to raise its first property
fund for the Asia Pacific region next year.  Both Henritze and Parikh were previously managing
directors. The promotions were confirmed today by  Peter Rose , a
Blackstone spokesman.  Blackstone manages about $54 billion of equity in its real
estate unit, led by  Jonathan Gray . The division generated 63

its traditional business of buying and selling companies, made
up 15 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
