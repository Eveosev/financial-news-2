The following is the text of the
Philadelphia area manufacturing activity from the  Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia .  Manufacturing activity rebounded this month, according to firms responding to
the December Business Outlook Survey.  Following reported declines in business
activity in late October and early November from the effects of Hurricane Sandy,
most of the survey’s measures showed notable improvement this month.  The
survey’s broad indicators of future activity also showed improvement this month.  Indicators Suggest a Pickup at Year-End  The survey’s broadest measure of manufacturing conditions, the diffusion index
of current activity, increased from a reading of -10.7 in November to 8.1 this
month.  This is the highest reading since April and is slightly above the
reading before the post-storm decline in November (see Chart).  The demand for
manufactured goods picked up: the new orders index increased 15 points, from
-4.6 in November to 10.7 this month. The current shipments index also improved
notably, rising by 25 points.  Labor market conditions at the reporting firms improved marginally this month.
The current employment index, at 3.6, registered its first positive reading in
six months. The percentage of firms reporting increases in employment (20
percent) narrowly exceeded the percentage reporting decreases (16 percent).
Firms also indicated an increase in the average workweek compared to last month.  Prices Received Index Moves Higher  The indexes for prices received for respondents’ own manufactured goods and
prices paid for purchased inputs suggest modest price pressures. The percentage
of firms reporting higher prices for their own manufactured goods edged up from
16 percent to 20 percent, and the prices received index increased 9 points, to
15.4.  The prices paid index was virtually unchanged at 27.8; 30 percent of the
firms reported higher prices for inputs.  Six-Month Indicators Improve  The survey’s future indicators suggest improved optimism among the reporting
manufacturers. The future general activity index increased from 20.0 to 30.9,
its highest reading in three months (see Chart 1). The percentage of firms
expecting increases in activity over the next six months (47 percent) exceeded
the percentage expecting decreases (16 percent) by a significant margin. The
indexes for future new orders and shipments improved, rising 12 and 7 points,
respectively.  The future employment index also increased notably, from 4.2 to
14.8.     In this month’s special questions, firms were asked about their expectations for
changes in various categories of input and labor costs for the coming year (see
Special Questions). Similar to responses in previous years, current responses
indicate that the largest annual increase is expected to be for health benefits
(7.2 percent). In contrast, other labor costs (wages and non-health-care
benefits) are expected to rise only 2.1 and 2.3 percent, respectively.  All
other nonlabor expense categories are expected to increase in 2013: raw
materials (2.6 percent), intermediate goods (2.2 percent), and energy (0.8
percent).  Firms were also asked how the expected cost increases will compare to
2012 costs. In every category, the share of firms indicating that their costs
would be higher in 2013 was greater than the share reporting that their costs
would be lower.  Summary   The December Business Outlook Survey suggests that activity in the region’s
manufacturing sector rebounded this month. Firms reported increases in overall
activity, new orders, shipments, and employment compared to the declines
reported in November following  Hurricane Sandy .  A slightly increased share of
firms reported receiving higher prices for their manu-factured goods this month.
The survey’s future activity indexes suggest that firms expect growth to
continue over the first six months of 2013.  Special Questions (December 2012)  1. What percentage change in costs do you expect for the following categories
