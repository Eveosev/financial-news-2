Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  fell the most in 21
months in Tokyo trading after Nomura Holdings Inc. cut its stock
recommendation, citing concerns the company may miss its profit
target on higher costs and slower sales.  Nissan,  Japan ’s second largest automaker, fell 7.1 percent
to 784 yen as of 11:27 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, headed
for its biggest decline since March 2011. The benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average dropped 1 percent.  “Earnings are increasingly likely to fall short of
guidance in 13/3, despite recent depreciation in the yen, as
sales volumes have lately fallen short of our expectations in
Japan, the U.S., and Europe,” Masataka Kunugimoto, Tokyo-based
auto analyst at Nomura, wrote in a report dated yesterday,
referring to the financial year ending March. The brokerage
lowered Nissan to neutral from buy and cut the target price to
810 from 880 yen.  Nissan, the top Japanese seller of vehicles in  China , cut
its full-year net income forecast 20 percent after consumer
backlash stemming from a territorial dispute sent sales lower in
its largest market.  Net income may total 320 billion yen ($3.8 billion) for the
year ending March 31, compared with its earlier estimate of 400
billion yen, the Yokohama, Japan-based company said last month.
The carmaker cut its operating income forecast to 575 billion
yen from 700 billion yen, and lowered its global vehicle sales
target by 5 percent to 5.08 million units.  Nissan’s main models such as the Altima and Note had weak
sales in the U.S. and Japan respectively for the months of
October and November, increasing concerns about earnings in the
second half of the fiscal year, according to Kunugimoto. In
 Europe , sales in  Russia  started declining in October due to
intensified competition, ending a period of growth until then.  “Incentives and other selling costs have been rising more
than we anticipated in Japan and Europe,” he said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
