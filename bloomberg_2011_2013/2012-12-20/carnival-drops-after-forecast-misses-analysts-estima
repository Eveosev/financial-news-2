Carnival Corp. (CCL) , the world’s biggest
cruise line operator, fell the most in 11 months after the
company’s 2013 profit forecast missed analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  slid 5.3 percent to $36.99 at the close in  New
York  after the Miami-based company said earnings will rise to as
much as $2.40 a share in 2013, excluding items. Analysts
predicted $2.46, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company’s European brands continue to suffer from a
deteriorating economy, Carnival said today in a statement. The
North America business and Costa will benefit from a recovery in
ticket prices and occupancy. The drop in shares was the biggest
since Jan. 17, the first day of trading after Carnival’s Costa
Concordia ran aground off the coast of  Italy . Carnival shares
have gained 13 percent this year.  For the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30, Carnival said net
income fell 57 percent to $93 million, or 12 cents a share, from
$217 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items,
profit fell to 13 cents, beating the 11-cent average of 16
analysts’ estimates.  Revenue for the quarter declined 3.1 percent to $3.58
billion, exceeding analysts’ projections of $3.49 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
