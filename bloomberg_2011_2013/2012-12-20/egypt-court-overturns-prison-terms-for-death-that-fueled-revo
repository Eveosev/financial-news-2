An Egyptian appeals court overturned
prison sentences against two policemen convicted in the case of
Khaled Saeed, whose death after being allegedly beaten by police
helped spark  Egypt ’s uprising last year.  The court today ordered a new trial for Mahmoud Salah and
Awad Soliman, who were sentenced by a lower court to seven years
in prison after they were convicted of “using force and
torture” in a way that led to Saeed’s death, the state-run
Middle East News Agency reported.  Saeed’s death in 2010 and widely circulated images of his
bloodied face became a rallying point for protests that led to
the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  last year. Accusations of
police brutality fueled the revolt.  An acquittal or light sentences in Saeed’s case will
probably anger activists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
