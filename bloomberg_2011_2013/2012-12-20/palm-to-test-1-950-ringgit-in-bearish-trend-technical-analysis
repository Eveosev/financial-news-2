Palm oil  will probably plunge 16
percent in the next three months to test 1,950 ringgit ($638) a
metric ton, the cheapest price in more than three years,
according to technical analysis by Trading Central SA.  The contract for March delivery “is still in a bearish
trend as it remains under pressure below both the 20-day and 50-
day simple moving averages,” said Jeffrey Zhang, Hong Kong-
based head of Asia research. The averages “are heading
downwards and should continue to push the price lower,” he said
in an e-mail today.  Palm tumbled 27 percent this year as output in Indonesia
and  Malaysia , the biggest producers, outpaced demand from China
and  India . The most-active contract on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange slumped to 2,217 ringgit on Dec. 13, the lowest level
since November 2009, and was at 2,314 by 3:32 p.m. Kuala Lumpur
time. Futures last traded below 1,950 ringgit in March 2009.  The 20-day moving average was about 2,375.60 ringgit and
the 50-day average about 2,473.76 today. In  technical analysis ,
