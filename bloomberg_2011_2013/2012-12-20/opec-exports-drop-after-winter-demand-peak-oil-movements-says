The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will cut crude exports by 2.6 percent as
demand during the northern hemisphere winter begins to slacken,
according to tanker tracker Oil Movements.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will export 24.1 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Jan.
5, down 640,000 barrels a day from the previous period, the
researcher said in an e-mailed report today. The figures exclude
Angola and  Ecuador .  “There is a dip between the two halves of winter,”  Roy Mason , the company’s founder Mason said by phone from Halifax,
 England . “We’re in that dip now. There’s nothing unusual about
that but the volumes on the downside have been pretty severe,
having gone up an unusual amount earlier.”  Brent crude  has fallen 14 percent from its March peak to
about $110 a barrel today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London.  Middle East shipments will slide 3.5 percent to 17.75
million barrels a day in the period, compared with 18.4 million
in the four weeks to Dec. 8, according to the report. That
figure includes non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will average 483.74 million barrels,
down 4.9 percent on the previous period, the data show. Oil
Movements calculates the volumes by tallying tanker bookings.
Its figures exclude crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC comprises Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  Oil Movements said its next report will be published on
Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
