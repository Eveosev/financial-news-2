Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  named Karen Roberts general counsel as her predecessor, Jeff Gearhart,
focuses on global compliance efforts while the company grapples
with allegations of bribery in  Mexico .  Roberts, 42, a 17-year veteran of the company who now
handles Wal-Mart’s real estate operations, will start the new
role on Feb. 1, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said
today in a statement. Gearhart, 48, will continue to oversee the
legal department in his role as executive vice president and
corporate secretary and work with Wal-Mart’s compliance, ethics
and investigations teams.  The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and
Exchange Commission are investigating allegations that Wal-Mart
systematically bribed Mexican officials so it could more quickly
open stores in the country. Wal-Mart said in November it also
has started inquiries into potential violations of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act in  Brazil ,  India  and China.  In October, the company combined its compliance office with
ethics, investigations and legal functions to form one
organization.  Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer,  rose  0.6 percent to
$68.96 at 2:50 p.m. in New York. The shares had advanced 15
percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
