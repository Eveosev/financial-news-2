Nigeria ’s $1 billion sovereign
wealth fund will start making investments in March after
receiving board approval, it said.  “We’ll start all the securities investing by March” for
the Fiscal Stabilization Fund and the Future Generations Fund,
Uche Orji, chief executive officer of the Nigeria Sovereign
Investment Authority, said today in an interview in Abuja. For
the Infrastructure Fund, “we’ll start investing in the second
half of 2013.”  Nigeria set up a wealth fund in May last year to invest
savings made from the difference between budgeted oil prices and
actual market prices. Africa’s most populous country of more
than 160 million people relies on crude exports for more than 90
percent of foreign income and about 80 percent of government
revenue, making it vulnerable to swings in prices.  The wealth fund will help meet budget shortfalls in the
future, provide dedicated funding for development of
infrastructure and keep some savings for the future generation,
according to the law establishing it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
