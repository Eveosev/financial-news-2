Oando Plc (OANDO) , a Nigerian energy
company, received regulatory approval for a rights offer to
raise 54.6 billion naira ($347 million) to repay a loan and buy
assets.  The Lagos-based company will start the sale on Dec. 28 and
will close it on Feb. 6, it said in a statement on the
 Johannesburg Stock Exchange  today. Oando first proposed an offer
of 35 billion naira in September.  Part of the proceeds will be used to repay some of a 60
billion-naira syndicated loan used to purchase exploration and
production assets, including swamp drilling rigs in Africa’s
biggest oil producer. Oando also plans to use the offer to fund
acquisitions by its energy unit and for working capital.  “We are at the final stages in the execution of our
overall strategy to increase our exposure to the upstream sector
whilst reducing the dependence on the downstream,” Chief
Executive Officer Wale Tinubu, said in the statement. In the oil
industry, upstream refers to exploration and production, while
downstream refers to refining and retailing.  Oando’s  shares  listed on the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  have
dropped 40 percent this year to 13.1 naira at the 2:30 p.m.
close today compared with a 33 percent rise in the Lagos-based
bourse’s  All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
