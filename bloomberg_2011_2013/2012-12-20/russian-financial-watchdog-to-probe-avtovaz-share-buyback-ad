Russia’s Financial Markets Service
opened a probe into “manipulation of shares” of the country’s
biggest carmaker, OAO AvtoVAZ, after an ad for a stock buyback
was published today in the Vedomosti newspaper, the watchdog’s
head,  Dmitry Pankin , said in his blog.  AvtoVAZ said the buyback announcement wasn’t genuine,
calling it a “provocation.” The carmaker’s shares had jumped
as much as 24 percent on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
