UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland ’s largest
lender, appointed investment banker Greg Kennedy to lead its
financial institutions group in the Americas.  Kennedy, who has worked at  Barclays Plc (BARC) , will join the
Zurich-based firm in March, UBS said in a memo to employees, a
copy of which was obtained today by  Bloomberg News . He will be
based in New York, reporting to Steve Cummings, who leads the
corporate client solutions unit in the Americas.  UBS has reorganized its investment bank and pledged to exit
most of its fixed-income trading businesses to boost
profitability. The lender has produced 1.71 billion Swiss francs
($1.87 billion) from advisory and underwriting in the first nine
months of 2012, trailing Credit Suisse Group Inc.’s 2.27 billion
francs and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s $3.52 billion.  Kennedy was Barclays’s co-head of the depository group in
the Americas. He previously worked at Credit Suisse and began
his career as a mergers and acquisition attorney at Sullivan &
Cromwell LLP, according to the memo. Halle Benett, who
previously oversaw UBS’s FIG team in the Americas, will lead the
specialty finance group, according to the memo.  Financial companies in the Americas have been the seller,
target or acquirer on $641.2 billion of deals this year, up from
$615.1 billion in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
UBS ranks 11th among advisers on such mergers and acquisitions,
down from eighth last year, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
