Palm oil dropped the most in a week
on concern that exports from  Malaysia , the biggest producer
after Indonesia, may decline as buyers reduce purchases.  The contract for March delivery fell as much as 1.5 percent
to 2,296 ringgit ($750) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the most since Dec. 12, and ended the morning session
at 2,318 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures are heading for a 27
percent drop this year, the worst annual loss since the 2008
financial crisis, as stockpiles in Malaysia climbed to a record.  Shipments fell 1.9 percent to 1 million tons in the first
20 days of December from a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said
today. Stockpiles in Malaysia rose to 2.56 million tons last
month, the nation’s  palm oil  board said Dec. 10. Inventories
have swelled as output in Indonesia and Malaysia outpaced demand
from China and India.  “India is not buying aggressively because of lower demand
in the domestic market and higher stockpiles,” Ambika T.B., an
analyst at Karvy Comtrade Ltd., said by phone from the Indian
city of Hyderabad.  “Cancellation of U.S. soybeans cargo by
China has also led to weak sentiment in the oilseed complex.”  China canceled about 300,000 tons of soybeans for shipment
before Sept. 1, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on Dec.
18. Export sales of soybeans from the U.S., the largest grower
and shipper last year, probably fell to 400,000 to 1 million
tons in the week to Dec. 13, from 1.3 million tons a week
earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  Soybeans for March delivery declined 0.2 percent to
$14.2775 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for
delivery in March climbed 0.5 percent to 48.98 cents a pound.  Palm oil for May delivery fell 0.4 percent to 6,748  yuan 
($1,083) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil for
May dropped 1.6 percent to 8,584 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
