Euro-area  consumer confidence 
increased in December, signaling the economy may be gaining
strength to recover from a recession next year.  An index of household confidence in the 17-nation currency
bloc rose to minus 26.6 from minus 26.9 in November, the
European Commission in Brussels said in an initial estimate
today. Sentiment reached a 3 1/2-year low last month as record
unemployment and the recession weighed on sentiment. Economists
had forecast an increase to minus 26.5 in the December gauge,
according to the median of 29 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Dec.
17 that the new bond-purchase program and the creation of a
single banking supervisor may help foster a gradual recovery in
the euro area in the second half of next year. Euro-area
economic confidence unexpectedly rose in November and business
confidence in  Germany ,  Europe â€™s largest economy, increased in
December.  Still, with the jobless rate at a record 11.7 percent and
governments cutting spending to rein in excessive debt, the euro
area has entered its second recession in four years. The ECB on
Dec. 6 lowered its outlook and now expects the euro-area economy
to contract 0.5 percent this year and 0.3 percent in 2013.  The commission is scheduled to publish the final numbers
for  consumer confidence  and the wider indicator of euro-area
economic confidence on Jan. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
