Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Three Rivers
 refinery  in Texas will shut a fluid catalytic cracker in October
for planned work, according to a person with knowledge of the
situation.  An alkylation unit will also be shut, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.  Bill Day , a San Antonio-based spokesman for Valero, said in
an e-mail the company releases information on current and
planned turnarounds each quarter. He said it’s “too early for
me to speculate about something in October 2013.”  The Three Rivers refinery has a capacity of 100,000 barrels
a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
