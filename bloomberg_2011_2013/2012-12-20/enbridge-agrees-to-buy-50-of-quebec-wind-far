Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ,  Canada ’s largest oil-
pipeline operator, agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in an EDF EN
Canada Inc.  Quebec  wind farm for C$170 million ($172 million.)  The Massif du Sud project, consisting of 75 turbines, is
expected to be completed by the end of this month and will
generate enough power for 35,000 homes, Calgary-based Enbridge
said in a  statement  today.  This is Enbridge’s second time to partner with EDF EN
Canada, a subsidiary of Paris-based EDF Energies Nouvelles SA,
on a wind farm in Quebec. Enbridge aims to generate a kilowatt
of renewable energy for every kilowatt of conventional energy
its operations consume, according to the statement.  The projects “demonstrates Enbridge’s interest in
investing in renewable infrastructure across Canada,” Don
Thomspson, vice president for green energy, said in the
statement.  Hydro-Quebec will buy power from the wind farm under a 20-
year agreement. EDF En Canada’s EDF Renewable Services Canada
Inc. unit will provide for operations and maintenance.  REpower Systems SE, the German unit of Pune, India-based
 Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , supplied the project’s turbines. Suzlon,
India’s largest turbine maker, is expanding in Canada as the
country promotes wind power to drive its economy and provide
jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
