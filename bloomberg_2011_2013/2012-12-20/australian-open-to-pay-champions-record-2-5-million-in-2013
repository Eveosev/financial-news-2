The Australian Open tennis
tournament will pay its 2013 men’s and women’s singles champions
a record A$2.43 million ($2.5 million) each, organizers said.  The season-opening Grand Slam event in Melbourne next month
will also pay more prize money per round than any other
tournament,  Tennis Australia  said in an e-mailed statement.  The biggest increases are in the first three rounds, which
all had at least a 30 percent rise from the 2012 edition, the
governing body said. Prize money for reaching the round of 16,
quarterfinals and semifinals has gone up almost 15 percent.  “Our motivation is to make a major contribution toward
helping ensure professional tennis players can make a decent
living,” Tournament Director Craig Tiley said in the statement.
“It is a real issue and needs to be urgently addressed
throughout the sport.”  The tournament starts Jan. 14 at Melbourne Park.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
