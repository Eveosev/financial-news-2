Bordeaux winemakers are predicting
that futures prices for the 2012 vintage will resist pressure
for cuts from U.K. and U.S. buyers even as speculative demand
cools.  Prospects for the vintage, due to be sold through brokers
next spring, improved late in the season as the weather turned
more favorable. Producers surveyed at  London  tastings said 2012
prices will probably stabilize around 2011 levels, still well
below the peaks reached for higher-quality 2009 and 2010 wines.  Futures prices for the 2011s were slashed by 40 percent or
more six months ago in recognition of the difference in quality
between that crop and the previous two years, which had drawn
strong speculative buying from Asian collectors. Winemakers’
assessment of the low-yielding 2012 vintage indicates they see
stability returning to futures prices when they are decided next
year, with 2011 levels providing a likely benchmark.  “I would suspect that the price of the 2012 will be very
much in the region of the 2011, because the global economy is
not very good,” Herve Berland, managing director of Saint-
Estephe second-growth Chateau Montrose, said in an interview
during a Decanter tasting in London last month, while cautioning
it’s too soon to predict. “I don’t anticipate any big jump.”  An unusually cold, wet spring delayed flowering on the
vines this year. Hot, dry conditions from early August through
mid-September enabled surviving grapes to recover and fully
ripen. Top chateaus were able to bring most of their crop in
before rain struck during the September harvest period.  Chinese Market  Montrose’s 2012 wine is showing signs of being better than
2011 and 2008, with “lots of tannin, lots of fruit,” Berland
said. “I don’t want to speak too early, but what I’ve tasted in
the vat is very, very good and very consistent.”  Declines in secondary-market prices for recent vintages
have driven the London-based Liv-ex wine market’s Bordeaux 500
Index down 6.4 percent since the start of this year, as Chinese
buying has become selective and debt concerns in  Europe  and the
U.S. curb fine wine demand. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, which
includes just Bordeaux first-growths, is down 10.6 percent.  At  Chateau Palmer , a Margaux third-growth property, there
was a contrast between the earlier-ripening Merlot grapes,
characterized by strong fruit content, and the later-maturing
 Cabernet Sauvignon , fresher and lower in alcohol, according to
managing director Thomas Duroux.  He compared the quality of the 2012 vintage to 2008, rather
than the more powerful, distinctive wines of the past three
years, and said it’s too early to predict pricing.  ‘Strong Brands’  “It’s not the easiest time for Bordeaux,” Duroux said at
the Decanter magazine tasting. “It went super-high with the top
vintages, ’09 and ’10, and with the arrival of the Chinese
market. It settled down a little bit with ’11, and we’ll see
what happens with ’12, but I don’t see it increasing again.”  Christian Seely, managing director of Pauillac second-
growth Chateau Pichon-Longueville, part of Axa Millesimes’ wine
estates, said pricing policy will vary among producers.  “There are some chateaus that move much less and others
that move much more,” he said in an interview. “We’ll see the
same thing in 2012. Chateaus that have strong brands, that are
firm with their pricing in the market, I think will do well.”  The market price tracked by Liv-ex for Pichon-Longueville
shows its 2011 vintage available for about $1,140 a case from
European merchants, compared with $2,406 for 2010, $1,943 for
2009 and $1,171 for 2008.  Speculative Demand  The lower prices for the 2011 and 2008 also apply to
Montrose, a property owned by French construction and media
moguls Martin and Olivier Bouygues.  The 2011 is available for $1,140 a case and the 2008 for
$1,008, according to Liv-ex data on its Cellar Watch site, while
the 2010 and 2009 vintages, boosted by higher quality and demand
from  Asia , are on offer for $2,265 and $3,415 respectively.  That pattern of pricing over the past four vintages, shaped
by the speculative demand chasing the 2009 and 2010 wines and a
switch in focus by Chinese buyers toward rarer Burgundies over
the past year, is reflected across the Medoc.  “The prices that came down were the ones that were getting
a bit frothy,” Seely said. “There was a little bit of a
shakeout which I think was entirely healthy, because that type
of speculative price rise is not good for anybody.”  Declines in prices for 2009 Bordeaux wines bought as
futures may deter some investors,  John Kapon , Chief Executive
Officer of New York-based auction house Acker Merrall & Condit,
said in a phone interview.  Sustainable Futures  “If you’re going to ask people to pay for something in
advance and then it’s down in value, I don’t know how that’s 
sustainable,” Kapon said, while noting that the global wine 
market has stabilized and “activity is healthy again.”  Michael Saunders , managing director of London-based
merchant Bibendum Wine Ltd., said the 2012 vintage would be
smaller than last year because of lower yields and rigorous
grape selection, and that pricing may pose a challenge after the
difficulties selling some of the 2011s.  Although prices for the 2011s did come down, “it wasn’t
enough to attract more people into the market,” Saunders said
in an interview at a tasting organized in  Covent Garden  last
month by Bibendum and the regional producers’ association Union
des Grands Crus de Bordeaux.  “I think there’s still a lot of stock left in Bordeaux,”
he said. “It’s a challenge to know what’s going to happen to
the 2012 campaign.”  Muse highlights include  Jason Harper  on cars,  Rich
