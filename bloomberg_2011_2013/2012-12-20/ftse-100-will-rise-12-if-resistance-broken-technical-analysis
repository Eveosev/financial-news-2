U.K. stocks  will rally 12 percent if
the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  clears a resistance level that has
held since February 2011, according to a technical analyst at
Taler Asset Management.  If the gauge can breach the 6,100 level, the next level of
resistance would be at 6,700, last reached in mid-2007. The
measure rose 0.4 percent to 5,961.59 yesterday, its highest in
nine months, amid optimism that U.S. lawmakers are making
progress towards a budget agreement.  “The upside potential for the FTSE index is limited to
that area of resistance between 5,900 to 6,100,” Julius de Kempenaer, a senior technical analyst at Taler Asset Management
Ltd. in Gibraltar, wrote in an e-mail. “A break higher,
preferably beyond the cluster of highs that was set in the
beginning of 2011, would open up a lot of fresh upside potential
that could take the FTSE back to the peak levels seen in 2007.”  While the index tested the 6,100 level in mid-2011, it
failed to close above the resistance, de Kempenaer wrote.  A
decline below the recent November low of 5,600 would negate the
bullish scenario, he wrote.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study price
