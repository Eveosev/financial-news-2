Serbia’s current-account deficit
widened 24 percent in the first 10 months, while a sovereign
bond sale in September prevented the gap from overshooting the
central bank’s full-year forecast.  The shortfall rose to 2.68 billion euros ($3.56 billion)
through October, as the trade deficit expanded 8.7 percent,
remittances dropped 8.6 percent and net foreign investments
remained weak throughout the year, according to the balance of
payments report published by the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka
Srbije today.  “If there had been no Eurobond sale, the current-account
deficit would’ve already exceeded 3 billion euros,” said
Ljiljana Grubic, an analyst at Raiffeisen Banka AD in Belgrade.
Serbia raised $1 billion from a Eurobond sale in September and
$750 million in November.  The central bank sees the full-year current-account gap at
3.1 billion euros, or 10.7 percent of gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
