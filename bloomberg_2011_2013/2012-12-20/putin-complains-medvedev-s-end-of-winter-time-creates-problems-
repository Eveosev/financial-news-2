President  Vladimir Putin  said an
unpopular decision by  Dmitry Medvedev  when head of state to stop
changing the time for the Russian winter also bothers him.  “There are problems,” Putin said at a news conference
today in Moscow. “I face them myself.” One difficulty is that
it stays dark until late in the morning, he said.  International sporting bodies have criticized the change
because it increases the time difference with  London  to four
hours and with major European cities to three hours, Putin said.
Russia will host the 2014 Winter Olympics Games in Sochi on the
 Black Sea .  Russians left clocks unchanged in October for a second
year. During a call-in show in December 2011, Putin answered
numerous questions about the decision, which left the country
permanently on summer time and meant darkness lasts until 10
a.m. in the depths of winter.  “When Medvedev took the decision, he based it on a
significant part of the population believing the previous system
affected their health and the farming industry,” Putin said.
“It turned out that there are more people unhappy with the
change than those who called for it.”  Medvedev, who replaced Putin as president for four years
from 2008 because of a constitutional ban on three consecutive
Kremlin terms, now serves as prime minister after stepping aside
for the Russian leader to return to the top job.  To contact the reporter on this story:
