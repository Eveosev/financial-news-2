Top-ranked  Duke University  stayed
undefeated with an 88-47 college basketball victory against
 Cornell University , while  Rick Pitino ’s No. 5  University of
Louisville  topped his son’s Florida International University
79-55.  Seth Curry scored 20 points to lead the Blue Devils to
their 10th straight victory this season. Mason Plumlee added 18
and Rasheed Sulaimon had 16 points for Duke last night at
Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham,  North Carolina .  Duke moved out to a 41-30 halftime lead before outscoring
Cornell 47-17 in the second half. The Blue Devils were seven of
21 for 33 percent from 3-point territory.  Shonn Miller had 14 points for the Big Red, who fell to
4-7. Cornell, which hit one of 11 3-point attempts, has lost all
four of its road games this season.  At KFC Yum! Center in Louisville,  Kentucky , Wayne
Blackshear scored 18 points to lead the Cardinals, who improved
to 10-1. Peyton Siva had 15 points and 12 assists and Chane
Behanan added 14 points and 11 rebounds with Russ Smith scoring
14.  “We did some good things offensively and got some good
work against the zone,” Louisville coach Pitino told reporters.  Siva recorded a career high five 3-pointers for the
Cardinals.  “I just took my open shots,” Siva said. “I’m not going
to make one every game, but tonight it felt good and they played
me for the 3 and I just took the shots.”  The contest was the first between Pitino and his son,
Richard, who left his job as a Louisville assistant to succeed
 Isiah Thomas  as coach at FIU.  Tymell Murphy had 12 points and 12 rebounds for the
Panthers (3-5).  To contact the reporter on this story:
