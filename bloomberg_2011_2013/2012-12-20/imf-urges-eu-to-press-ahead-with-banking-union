The European Union faces “great
challenges” and must press ahead with plans for a banking union
to end its sovereign debt and financial crisis, the
 International Monetary Fund  said today.  The IMF urged the EU to build a common system for
stabilizing failing banks following this month’s agreement to
give bank-supervision powers to the  European Central Bank . A
common bank backstop, deposit guarantee systems and more closely
aligned financial regulations also are needed, the Washington-
based lender said.  “The present conjuncture makes management of the situation
particularly difficult,” the IMF said in preliminary
conclusions of its first EU-wide financial sector assessment.
“The crisis reveals that handling financial system problems at
the national level has been costly, calling for a Europe-wide
approach.”  European finance ministers last week agreed to put the ECB
in charge of all euro-area lenders in a deal that paves the way
for the currency bloc’s firewall fund to provide direct bailouts
to banks. The policy makers’ goal was to break a vicious circle
that undermined confidence in  Europe ’s banks.  The IMF said that enabling the region’s bailout mechanism
to recapitalize banks directly should be done “expeditiously.”
It also recommended improving and expanding stress tests for
financial institutions so they can reveal “liquidity risks and
structural weaknesses.”  -- Editors: Paul Badertscher, Gail DeGeorge  To contact the reporters on this story:
