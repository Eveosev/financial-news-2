The Spanish parliament passed an
energy law that will impose a 7 percent tax on electricity
generation starting Jan 1, a step to close a funding gap the
power companies built up with the government.  The government is “on track” to plug the tariff deficit,
which amounts to about 6 billion euros ($8 billion) a year and
represents the difference between costs and revenue in the power
system, Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria said today in
Madrid. “Now we must approach the regulatory aspects.”  The measures hit both traditional and renewable energy
plants and mark the first time  Spain  has taxed wind and solar
power plants. The government halted subsidies for all clean
energy projects earlier this year after a boom in installations
drove up electricity prices and boosted the tariff deficit.  “Come Jan. 1, we will realize we’re missing 7 percent from
our balance sheets,” said Jose Miguel Villarig, the president
of APPA, a group of clean energy producers.  Renewable energy plants generated about 27 percent of
Spain’s electricity last year and receive about 7 billion euros
annually in subsidies. Those have inflated the tariff deficit.  The tax set out today is bigger than the 6 percent tax set
out in a previous draft of the legislation detailed on Sept. 14.
That included a levy on fossil-fuel fired plants as well as
nuclear and hydropower. It also had a flat tax for both
traditional and low-carbon energy, which aims to raise about 2.7
billion euros ($3.5 billion) a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
