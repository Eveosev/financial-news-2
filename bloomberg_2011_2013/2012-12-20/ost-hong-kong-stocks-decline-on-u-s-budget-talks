Most  Hong Kong   stocks  fell amid
signs U.S. budget negotiations are deteriorating. Metals
producers dropped after prices of the commodities declined
yesterday.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest producer
of the metal, fell 2 percent. Techtronic Industries Co., a maker
of power tools that counts  North America  as its biggest market,
retreated 2.5 percent. Esprit Holdings Ltd., a clothier that
said it may post a first-half loss, extended its drop today
after brokerages cut its rating or reduced target prices.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.1 percent to 22,592.84 as of
10:11 a.m. in Hong Kong. About four stocks fell for each that
gained on the 50-company measure, with volume 7.2 percent below
the 30-day average for the time of day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies fell 0.5 percent to 11,336.56.  “Cracks appeared in the fiscal-cliff negotiations,” said
Stan Shamu, Melbourne-based markets strategist at IG Markets Ltd.
“The Republicans failed to come up with a reasonable compromise
to President Obama’s proposal. Market participants decided to
exercise caution despite U.S. leaders still insisting they are
hoping to have something done by Christmas.”  Hong Kong’s benchmark index advanced 23 percent this year
through yesterday as central banks from the U.S.,  Europe  and
 Japan  announced stimulus to boost growth, and as U.S. and China
showed signs of recovery in the world’s two largest economies.
Shares on the measure  traded  at 11.9 times average estimated
earnings yesterday, compared with 13.8 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.8 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Plan B Burden’  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures fell 0.2 percent today.
The gauge slid 0.8 percent yesterday as White House
Communications Director  Dan Pfeiffer  said House Speaker  John
Boehner ’s “Plan B” would put “too big a burden on the middle
class” and President  Barack Obama  would veto it. Boehner
replied that Obama will be responsible for “the largest tax
increase in American history” if Democrats don’t accept the
measure the House plans to pass today.  The House may vote today on Boehner’s plan, which would
raise tax rates on income of above $1 million, rather than the
$400,000 threshold the president proposed in his latest offer.  Metal producers declined after the London Metal Exchange
Index of six industrial metals slid 0.9 percent yesterday.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index dropped 0.1 percent to
22,588. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  rose 0.6 percent to 15.76,
indicating traders expect a swing of 4.5 percent for the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
