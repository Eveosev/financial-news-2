The United Nations Security Council
today approved the deployment of an African force to retake
northern  Mali  from extremists linked to al-Qaeda along with
training and equipment for Malian soldiers.  The UN’s decision-making body unanimously authorized an
African-led mission for an initial period of one year to “take
all necessary measures” to regain control of territory that
fell under Islamist groups after a coup in March. The resolution
asks for progress in political talks and verified training among
the conditions for military action.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
