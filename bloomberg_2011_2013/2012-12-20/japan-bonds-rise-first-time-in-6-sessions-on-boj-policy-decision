Japan ’s bonds rose for the first
time in six sessions as the central bank decided to buy more
government debt to support the economy.  Ten-year yields slid from a one-month high as domestic
stocks snapped a three-day gain. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said the
nation’s economy remained weak and added 10 trillion yen ($119
billion) today to its 66 trillion-yen fund that buys assets,
including government bonds. BOJ Policy board member Koji Ishida
proposed scrapping interest paid for deposits at the central
bank, which was voted down, according to a  statement  after the
central bank concluded a two-day policy meeting.  “Ishida’s proposal for abandoning the deposit rate is a
buying catalyst for short-term notes,” said  Yasunari Ueno , the
chief market economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo ., one
of the 25 primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt
sales. “The BOJ decision today was in line with the market’s
expectations.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell 1 basis point to 0.77
percent as of 3:14 p.m. in Tokyo after earlier declining 2 1/2
basis points. The 0.7 percent security maturing in December 2022
added 0.092 yen to 99.350, according to Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the country’s largest inter-dealer debt broker.  The 10-year rate touched 0.78 percent yesterday, the
highest since Nov. 2.  “Japan’s economy has added somewhat weak movement and is
expected to remain so for the time being,” the BOJ said in a
statement today.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  of domestic shares dropped 1.2
percent. The yen jumped as much as 0.7 percent to 83.86 per
dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
