Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. (RIO)  will modify
contracts for aluminum smelting to end a European Union
antitrust probe over tying its technologies to sales of smelting
equipment.  “Rio Tinto Alcan’s commitments will open up the market
for equipment used in aluminum smelters,” EU Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said in an e-mailed statement
today. “As a result, the customers of aluminum technology and
equipment will have more choice.”  EU regulators accepted Montreal-based Rio Tinto Alcan’s
pledge today, ending an investigation into its contracts for
licensing so-called AP aluminum smelting technology. Rio Tinto
Alcan will now allow licensees to choose any supplier of pot-
tending assemblies that meet certain technical requirements.  An EU settlement avoids any decision on whether a company
broke antitrust rules. Rio Tinto Alcan, a unit of  Rio Tinto
Group (RIO) , can be fined as much as 10 percent of its yearly revenue
if it breaks the terms of the legally binding settlement.  Rio Tinto Group agreed to acquire aluminum maker Alcan Inc.
for $38 billion in 2007. The EU investigation focused on Alcan’s
practices and those of Rio Tinto Alcan after the takeover.  To contact the reporter on this story:
