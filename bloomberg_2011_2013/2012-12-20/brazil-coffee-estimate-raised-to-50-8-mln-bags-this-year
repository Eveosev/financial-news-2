Coffee output in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, rose more than previously forecast to a record
50.8 million bags this year, the government said.  The estimate was raised from 50.5 million bags forecast on
Sept. 6, the Agriculture Ministry’s Conab crop-forecasting
agency said today by e-mail. Production climbed from 43.5
million bags last year.  Output of the mild-tasting arabica variety rose 19 percent
from last year to 38.3 million bags, while production of
robusta, mostly used to make instant coffee, increased 11
percent to 12.5 million, Conab said.  Most harvesting in Brazil runs from April to September. A
bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
