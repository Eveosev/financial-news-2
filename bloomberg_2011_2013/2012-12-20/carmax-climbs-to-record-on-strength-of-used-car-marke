CarMax Inc. (KMX) , the largest U.S. seller
of used cars, rose to a record price as increased vehicle sales
drove quarterly profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  CarMax  climbed  9 percent to $37.97 in trading in  New York ,
the highest closing price since the company’s 1997 initial
public offering. CarMax’s current market capitalization of $8.67
billion is the largest among U.S. used-car retailers.  Used-vehicle sales increased 16 percent to 105,815,
Richmond, Virginia-based CarMax said today in a statement. Net
income in the quarter ended Nov. 30 rose to $94.7 million, or 41
cents a share, from $82.1 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier.
The average estimate of 14  analysts surveyed  by Bloomberg was
for a profit of 39 cents.  “The business model and the industry dynamics have aligned
and the market seems to be recognizing that,”  Kevin Tynan , a
senior analyst for Bloomberg Industries based in Skillman,  New
Jersey , said in an e-mail. “Used-car demand and prices continue
to increase and margins on the used-car side are better than
new-car.”  Income from CarMax Auto Finance, the company’s lending
unit, increased 16 percent to $72.5 million during the quarter,
according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
