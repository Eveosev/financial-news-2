Gold traded near the lowest level
since August as an impasse in U.S. budget talks helped to boost
the dollar, countering investor holdings in exchange-traded
products at an all-time high.  Spot gold was little changed at $1,667.95 an ounce at 2 p.m.
in Singapore after dropping 0.2 percent yesterday and falling to
$1,661.10 on Dec. 18, the lowest since Aug. 31, on signs of
progress in the U.S. negotiations. Gold for February delivery
was at $1,668.40 an ounce from $1,667.70 on the Comex.  Officials in President  Barack Obama ’s administration told
leaders of business and financial-services groups that talks
with House Speaker  John Boehner  have deteriorated in the past 24
hours, a person familiar with the meeting said. Lawmakers are
negotiating to avert more than $600 billion in automatic tax
rises and spending cuts set to start in January, known as the
fiscal cliff. The Dollar Index snapped a four-day decline.  “We’ve had a few violent moves towards the downside,”
said  Jonathan Barratt , chief executive officer of Barratt’s
Bulletin, a commodity newsletter in Sydney. “Looking into 2013,
we still feel confident about prices eventually moving higher,”
he said, citing prospects for increased ETP demand, central-bank
buying and a weaker dollar next year.  Holdings in ETPs climbed 12 percent this year to 2,631.794
metric tons yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bullion
has advanced 6.7 percent this year, set for a 12th annual gain,
as central banks around the world added to stimulus.  Cash silver rose as much as 0.5 percent to $31.20 an ounce,
and was at $31.0838. The metal, which has risen 12 percent this
year, may rally to $40.25 in 2013, based on the median of 49
analyst, trader and investor estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Spot platinum was little changed at $1,591.39 an ounce
after falling for the past three days. The best performing
precious metal this year, up 14 percent, hit a two-week low of
$1,584 earlier. Palladium fell 0.5 percent to $691.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
