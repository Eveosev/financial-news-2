Iceland’s parliament, Althingi,
today passed the island’s 2013 budget with a deficit of 0.1
percent of gross domestic product, according to the bill posted
on the parliament’s  website .  The budget anticipates that revenue will rise by 37 billion
kronur ($294 million) to 570 billion kronur, almost matching
expenditures of 573 billion kronur.  Iceland, whose banks defaulted on $85 billion in 2008,
completed a 33-month  International Monetary Fund  program just
over a year ago. Since the banking collapse, the government has
sought to shift Iceland’s economic focus to traditional
industries such as fishing and tourism and away from finance.  The government said in September it expects a surplus
of 17.8 billion kronur, or 0.9 percent of GDP, in 2014. That
compares with an estimated 25.8 billion-krona deficit this year.  The budget was approved by 28 members of the government-
coalition minority. Twenty-six lawmakers -- including one from
the minority coalition -- abstained from voting. Nine members of
parliament were absent during the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
