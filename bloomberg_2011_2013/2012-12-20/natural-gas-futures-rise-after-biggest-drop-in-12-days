Natural gas futures in New York
climbed the most in two weeks after a government report showed
U.S. stockpiles fell more than expected last week.  Gas advanced 4.3 percent on an Energy Department report
that inventories dropped 82 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Dec. 14 to 3.724 trillion. Analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg forecast a withdrawal of 75 billion, while a survey of
Bloomberg users predicted a decrease of 76 billion.  “The storage number was a bullish surprise for the
market,” said Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at
INTL FCStone Inc. in  St. Louis Park ,  Minnesota . “We’ve had some
cold weather and we had been selling off for a few days, so we
were due for a rally.”  Natural gas for January delivery rose 14.2 cents to settle
at $3.462 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The percentage gain was the biggest since
Dec. 5.  The futures are up 16 percent this year, heading for the
first annual increase since 2007. Prices declined to $3.261 per
million Btu in intraday trading on Dec. 14, the lowest level
since Sept. 28.  February $3 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 2.1 cents lower at 2.3 cents on
volume of 3,947 contracts as of 3:03 p.m. Puts accounted for 56
percent of options volume.  Stockpile Decline  The stockpile decrease was smaller than the five-year
average decline for the week of 144 billion cubic feet,
department data show. A  surplus  to the five-year average rose to
10.2 percent from 8 percent the previous period. Supplies were
1.8 percent above year-earlier inventories, compared with 1.3
percent last week.  The gas inventory  surplus  to the average has slipped from a
six-year high of 61 percent in March, department data show.  MDA Weather Services predicted lower-than-average
temperatures in parts of the Midwest from Dec. 25 through Dec.
29. Earlier outlooks showed mostly normal readings.  The low in  Chicago  on Dec. 27 may be 14 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 10 Celsius), 6 less than usual, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  The low in  Des Moines ,  Iowa , may be 15 degrees, 1 lower
than normal. About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for
heating, Energy Department data show.  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas output in 2012
by 0.6 percent in a report Dec. 11 and boosted its outlook for
prices.  Marketed Production  Marketed gas production will average 69.22 billion cubic
feet a day this year, up from 68.84 billion estimated in
November, the Energy Department said in the monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook . Output may rise 0.5 percent in 2013 to 69.59
billion a day, department estimates show.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $2.78 per million British thermal units, compared
with the previous estimate of $2.77, according to the report
from the department’s Energy Information Administration.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first eight months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. slipped by
one to 416 last week, according to data from  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) 
in Houston. The rig count is down 49 percent this year.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
322,788 as of 2:48 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 362,000. Volume was 324,983 yesterday. Open interest was 1.16
million contracts, matching the three-month average.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
