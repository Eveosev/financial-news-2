Continental Resources Inc. (CLR) , the
largest leaseholder in North Dakota’s Bakken oil deposit, bought
more acreage there from  KKR & Co. (KKR) ’s Samson Resources Corp. for
$649.3 million in cash.  The purchase of 119,218 net acres includes production
equivalent to about 6,500 barrels of oil a day, Oklahoma City-
based Continental said today in a statement. Continental raised
$125 million selling producing assets elsewhere. The
transactions were announced Nov. 7. Samson was identified today
as the Bakken seller.  The company raised its 2013 forecast for production growth
and  capital spending , based on the two transactions announced
today. Total Bakken output will rise to 682,000 barrels a day
this quarter, 45 percent more than a year earlier, according to
Bloomberg Industries.  “The transactions add 20 Bakken wells to our 2013 drilling
program,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Harold Hamm  said
in today’s statement.  Continental’s output will rise as much as 40 percent from
2012 levels, up from a prior forecast of as much as 35 percent,
the company said. Spending will be $3.6 billion, up from a
planned $3.4 billion. Production expense per barrel will be from
$5.20 to $5.60 a barrel, down from an earlier range of $5.50 to
$5.90.  KKR & Co., the New York private-equity firm that began
investing in the energy industry in 1985, bought most of Samson
for $7.2 billion in November 2011 to capitalize on increased
production of shale-based oil and gas.  Continental rose 0.6 percent to $75.39 at the close in  New
York . KKR fell 0.9 percent to $14.57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
