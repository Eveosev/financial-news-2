Libya ’s Prime Minister Ali Zaidan
appointed a military governor for the southern region after the
government declared the area a restricted military zone and sent
in army units.  Zaidan announced the appointment at a news conference in
Tripoli late yesterday broadcast by Libyan television.  Aircraft will help patrol borders to monitor the movement
of armed groups and control traffickers of people, weapons and
drugs, Zaidan said.  Libyan lawmakers voted on Dec. 17 to close the country’s
southern border with Sudan, Niger,  Chad  and Algeria while the
military operation takes place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
