Belgian business confidence in
December rose more than expected as executives in the
 construction industry  were more optimist about demand.  The confidence index for Belgium increased to minus 11.8
from minus 13.4 in November, the Brussels-based National Bank of
Belgium said today in a statement. Economists had predicted an
increase in the index to minus 12.9, according to the median of
13 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Sentiment among executives in manufacturing also rose.
 Capital spending  by manufacturers is projected to rebound 14
percent next year, according to the National Bank of Belgiumâ€™s
semi-annual survey, a separate report published yesterday. That
follows an estimated drop in spending of 1.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
