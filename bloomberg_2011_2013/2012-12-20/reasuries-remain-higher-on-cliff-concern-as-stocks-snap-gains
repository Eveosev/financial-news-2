The Treasury sold $14 billion in
inflation-linked notes at a record-low negative  yield  as a
stalemate in efforts to end a U.S. budget showdown threatened to
push the economy into recession, spurring demand for refuge.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes were little changed as
House Speaker  John Boehner  said he expects to keep working on a
budget plan with President  Barack Obama . The House will vote on
a Republican plan Obama has criticized for not seeking enough
new revenue through taxes and has promised to veto. The U.S.
faces $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax boosts
starting next month if an accord isn’t reached. The sale of
five-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities drew a yield
of negative 1.496 percent.  “It’s not the return, it’s the purpose,” said  William Larkin , a fixed-income  money manager  who helps oversee $500
million at Cabot Money Management Inc. in Salem,  Massachusetts .  The 10-year  yield  was little changed at 1.8 percent at 5
p.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
It dropped four basis points earlier, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 1.76 percent, the lowest level since Dec. 18. The 1.625
percent note maturing in November 2022 rose 1/32, or 31 cents
per $1,000 face amount, to 98 14/32.  The 30-year bond yield was at 2.98 percent after sliding
four basis points earlier to 2.95 percent. It climbed to a
three-month  high  of 3.03 percent on Dec. 18.  Treasuries have returned 1.8 percent this year, set for the
worst yearly performance since a 3.7 percent decline in 2009,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  of U.S. shares has gained 17 percent,
including reinvested dividends.  TIPS Auction  The TIPS auction was the final of four note offerings this
week and $2.153 trillion of government debt sales in 2012.  The average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for the
inflated-indexed debt to yield negative 1.476 percent. The  bid-
to-cover  ratio, a gauge of demand that compares the amount bid
with the amount offered, was 2.7, versus 3.11 at the previous
auction in August. The average at the past 10 sales was 2.73.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 49 percent of the securities,
the most since 2006, versus an average at the past 10 sales of
36.7 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that
place their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 10.7
percent, compared with the 7.9 percent average at the past 10
auctions.  Holders of TIPS receive an adjustment to the principal
value of their securities equal to the change in the  consumer
price index , in addition to a fixed rate of interest that’s
smaller than the interest paid to a holder of conventional debt.
The difference is known as the break-even rate.  Real Yield  The fixed payment on five-year TIPS, known as the  real
yield , was pushed below zero as the rise in the CPI was greater
than the yield on regular five-year U.S. notes, which fell with
other Treasury yields as investors sought safety.  Efforts are deteriorating to resolve the budget stalemate.
The  Congressional Budget Office  has said the automatic tax
increases and spending cuts could lead to recession next year.  “The fiscal-cliff discussion looks like it’s veering off
tracks,” said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-
income trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York.  Until this week, Obama and Boehner were edging closer to a
deal. On Dec. 17, Obama gave Boehner his latest offer, which
reduced his revenue demand to $1.2 trillion from $1.4 trillion,
made a concession on Social Security spending and spared
households with between $250,000 and $400,000 in annual income
from tax rate increases. Boehner rejected it because Obama’s
spending cuts weren’t big enough. He drafted his Plan B, which
would raise taxes on income exceeding $1 million and which the
White House said Obama would veto.  ‘Remain Hopeful’  Boehner, speaking to reporters today, accused Obama of
being unwilling to stand up to other Democrats on the budget.
Still, Boehner said, “I remain hopeful” a deal can be reached.  “The market is waiting for more information about the
fiscal cliff,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading
in New York at Bank of  Nova Scotia , one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve .  Treasuries pared gains earlier after a revised reading
showed third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product expanded 3.1
percent, compared with a previously estimated 2.7 percent gain.
The data were released today by the Commerce Department.  The Fed bought $1.7 billion of Treasuries today due between
February 2023 and May 2030 and sold $7.4 billion of debt
maturing in 2015 and 2016. The transactions were part of
Operation Twist, under which the central bank replaces shorter-
maturity securities in its holdings with longer-dated debt to
hold down borrowing costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
