The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars held at the highest in two weeks, according to
a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 25 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:45 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure is the
costliest since Dec. 7.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 25 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another rose to a four-day high. The difference
between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-
OIS spread, was 12.1 basis points from 11.8 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.07
percent yesterday from 0.072 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was little changed at 6.2 basis points.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday to 233 billion euros ($308 billion) from 239 billion
euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
