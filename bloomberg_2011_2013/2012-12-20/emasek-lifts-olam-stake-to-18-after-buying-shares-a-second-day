Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore ’s
state-owned investment company, raised its stake in  Olam
International Ltd. (OLAM)  for a second day after it said the commodity
trader represents a “reasonably attractive” investment.  Aranda Investments Pte, controlled by Temasek, bought a
total of 23.9 million shares from Dec. 18 to Dec. 19, increasing
Temasek’s deemed interest to 18 percent from 17 percent,
according to an Olam filing today.  Temasek, Olam’s second-biggest shareholder, said yesterday
it raised its stake to 17 percent, saying that it’s “pleased”
to have the opportunity to add to its holdings. Temasek earlier
this month backed a proposed bond offering by Olam, the world’s
second-largest rice trader, agreeing to buy any rights not taken
up by other investors.  Olam plans to offer $750 million in bonds and as much as
$500 million in warrants to address any concerns about its
liquidity, after short-seller  Carson Block  said the company may
fail. Temasek could end up holding as much as 29 percent if it
exercises all the warrants in 2016 at the earliest, according to
Olam Chief Executive Officer Sunny Verghese.  The stock rose for a third day, adding 0.7 percent to
S$1.55 in Singapore trading at 9:19 a.m. local time.  Kewalram Singapore Ltd., which has a 20 percent stake in
Olam according to data compiled by Bloomberg, said Dec. 10 it
also supports the commodity trader’s issue of bonds and
warrants.  Olam has said it faces no risk of insolvency and sued Block
and his research firm Muddy Waters LLC on Nov. 21 in the
Singapore High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
