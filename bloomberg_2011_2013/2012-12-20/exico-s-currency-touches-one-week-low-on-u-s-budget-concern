Mexico’s peso touched a one-week low
as U.S. lawmakers struggled to head off scheduled tax increases
and spending cuts that may push the Latin American country’s
biggest export market into recession.  The peso was little changed at 12.7612 per U.S. dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City after earlier slipping to 12.7986, the
weakest intraday level since Dec. 14. The currency has climbed
9.2 percent this year, the most among the dollar’s 16 most-
traded counterparts.  U.S. House Republicans plan to vote today on a tax increase
for top earners, which they had previously said would destroy
jobs. Lawmakers and President  Barack Obama  are trying to reach a
compromise on tax rates as part of a bid to avert the more than
$600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases due to start
next month. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the
world’s biggest market.  The peso pared earlier losses after the U.S. Commerce
Department reported a revised 3.1 percent increase in gross
domestic product in the third quarter, exceeding the highest
projection compiled by Bloomberg and the previously estimated
2.7 percent gain.  Yields on local-currency bonds due in 2024 rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, 5.53 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.09 centavo to 139.15
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
