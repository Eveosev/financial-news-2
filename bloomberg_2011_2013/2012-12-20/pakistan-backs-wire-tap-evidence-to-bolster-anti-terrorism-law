Pakistan ’s National Assembly
approved a bill allowing use of electronic evidence from wire-
tapping and communication intercepts against terror suspects
after a large number of acquittals by anti-terrorism courts for
lack of proof.  “It is an accepted fact that terrorists are not getting
convicted and are not brought to justice because of lack of
relevant rules and laws,” Law Minister Farooq H. Naek said
while presenting the bill in the National Assembly, or the lower
house, in Islamabad today.  The U.S. “Country Reports on Terrorism 2011,” released in
July, put the acquittal rate for terrorist cases to as high as
85 percent in Pakistan, which is seen as a hub of global
terrorism. Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was found and killed
in a Pakistani town by U.S. Navy SEALs in May 2011.  Nuclear-armed Pakistan is an ally of the U.S. and has lost
more than 40,000 people to bombings by the Taliban since joining
the U.S. in the war on terror after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.  The bill, which was unanimously passed by the National
Assembly, now goes to the Senate, Pakistan’s upper house.  To contact the reporter on this story:
