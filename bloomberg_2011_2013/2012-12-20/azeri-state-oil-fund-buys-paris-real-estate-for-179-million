Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund, known
as Sofaz, bought an office and retail property in Paris for 135
euros ($179 million), its second real estate investment in a
week as it seeks to diversify reserves.  The property, 8 Place Vendome, was purchased from  AXA Real
Estate (AXAEDAC)  and has a total area of 5,400 square meters (58,125
square feet), Sofaz said today in an e-mailed statement.  “With these recent real estate transactions, Sofaz has
established its presence in two main commercial centers of
 Europe  –-  London  and Paris,” Israfil Mammadov, the fund’s chief
investment officer, said in the statement. “Next year we will
continue building our globally diversified real estate portfolio
reflecting our investment strategy that foresees investments in
core prime office space with strong fundamentals.”  Sofaz announced the purchase of an office complex in
London’s West End for 177 million pounds ($288 million) on Dec
17. The fund, established in 1999 to manage the Caspian Sea
nation’s state income from oil and natural gas sales, had $33.9
billion of assets as of Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
