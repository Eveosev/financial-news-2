French Finance Minister  Pierre
Moscovici  reiterated the government’s forecast for gross
domestic product growth of 0.8 percent in 2013 in an interview
with BFM Radio today.  Moscovici sees a slow start to growth next year, saying
that progress depends on “dynamic” growth in the euro region,
stable French demand and increased competitiveness.  “If these three factors work together, then it will be
possible,” to reach the growth target, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
