The  yuan  strengthened for a fourth
day after the World Bank said  China ’s economy may have
“bottomed out” after a seven-quarter slowdown.  The lender raised its estimate for next year’s growth in
the world’s second-largest economy to 8.4 percent from an
October projection of 8.1 percent, according to a report
yesterday. China’s railway fixed-asset investment may rise
“slightly” in 2013 to as much as 700 billion yuan ($112
billion), China Securities Journal reported today. U.S. stocks
fell yesterday on concern lawmakers are struggling to agree on
budget changes.  “China’s growth is showing signs of resilience and the
government sees boosting growth as top priority, which is
positive for the yuan,” said Kenix Lai, a Hong Kong-based
foreign-exchange analyst at Bank of East Asia Ltd. “Yet, the
currency may consolidate recent gains on uncertainties over the
U.S. budget.”  The yuan rose 0.02 percent to 6.2290 per dollar as of 10:06
a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency has gained 0.89 percent this quarter,
extending this year’s advance to 1.04 percent.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the reference rate by
0.02 percent to 6.28770 per dollar today, the first weakening in
four days. The spot rate is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the fixing.  Offshore Market  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority injected HK$4.5 billion
($581 million) into its banking system yesterday to prevent the
city’s currency from rising beyond its permitted trading range.
The aggregate balance will increase to HK$251 billion tomorrow.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.03
percent to 6.2075 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were steady at
6.3113, a 1.3 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, has fallen 93 basis
points, or 0.93 percentage point, to 1.80 percent this year.
That’s lower than the past five years’ average of 2.36 percent.
The gauge rose five basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
