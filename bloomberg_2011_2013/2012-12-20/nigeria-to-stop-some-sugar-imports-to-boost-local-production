Nigeria  will end imports of packaged
sugar from Jan. 1 to boost local investment and achieve self
sufficiency in production of the sweetener, the National Sugar
Development Council said.  Imports of machinery for local sugar refineries won’t be
subject to tariffs, Lateef Busari, executive secretary of the
council, said in an e-mailed statement today from Abuja, the
capital. Investors in domestic processors and “sugarcane-to-
sugar value chains” will get a five-year tax holiday, he said.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation with more than 160
million people, spends $10 billion annually importing rice,
wheat, sugar and fish, according to the  Agriculture Ministry .
The West African nation plans to reduce imports and boost
domestic  food production  by 20 million metric tons by 2015.  Imports of raw sugar for refining will be approved by
President Goodluck Jonathan only on recommendations from the
Trade and Investment Minister, Busari said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
