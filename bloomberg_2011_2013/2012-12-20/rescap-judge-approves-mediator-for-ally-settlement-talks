Residential Capital LLC won court
approval of a mediator for talks with creditors opposing the
bankrupt mortgage company’s $750 million settlement with parent
 Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan agreed to
appoint fellow judge James Peck to try to resolve a fight over
how much Ally should be forced to pay to avoid a lawsuit over
what the company did before it put ResCap into bankruptcy and
other issues.  “There is going to need to be extensive negotiations and
hard decisions,” Glenn said in court today. “The alternative
is going to be close to nuclear war with a lot of deep pockets
and high stakes.”  Unsecured noteholders represented by Wilmington Trust NA
say Ally is offering too little to resolve claims that it
stripped ResCap of valuable assets. A bankruptcy examiner is
investigating the settlement offer and plans to deliver a report
in April.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
