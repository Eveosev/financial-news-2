Prudential Capital Partners, the
middle-market mezzanine fund business of the second-largest U.S.
life insurer, has exceeded the $1 billion goal for its latest
fund that will provide financing to mid-sized companies.  Prudential Capital IV LP, which will invest primarily in
North American companies, raised $1.15 billion, the Chicago-
based unit said today in a statement. Prudential Capital raised
$965 million for the prior fund gathered in 2009.  Private-equity deals typically consist of a combination of
equity and debt. Mezzanine financing, the layer of funding
between common equity and bank loans, tends to yield more than
other forms of debt because it ranks behind other obligations in
the event of default.  Prudential Capitalâ€™s fourth fund will deploy $10 million to
$100 million per deal, investing as part of acquisitions,
recapitalizations and growth financings. The firm expects to
make investments over the next three to five years.  The mezzanine unit is part of Prudential Capital Group, the
private fixed-income investment business of  Prudential Financial
Inc. (PRU) , which manages a portfolio of more than $65 billion as of
Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
