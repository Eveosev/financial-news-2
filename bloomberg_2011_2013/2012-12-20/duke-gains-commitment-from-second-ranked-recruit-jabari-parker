Jabari Parker, the No. 2 recruit in
ESPN’s men’s college basketball class of 2013 rankings,
announced that he will attend  Duke University .  Parker, a 6-foot-8, 220-pound forward, picked the Blue
Devils over finalists Stanford, Michigan State, Florida and BYU.  “I just chose Duke because it was a perfect fit for me,”
Parker said at a televised news conference at his high school,
Simeon Career Academy in  Chicago , holding up a Duke T-shirt.  As a junior Parker was named the national Gatorade Player
of the Year after averaging 19.5 points, 8.9 rebounds and 4.9
assists per game.  It’s the third member of the ESPN 100 for Durham, North
Carolina-based Duke, the top-ranked team in the Associated Press
top 25 poll with a 10-0 record.  Andrew Wiggins, the top-ranked player on the  ESPN 100  list
of recruits for the 2013 freshman college basketball class, has
yet to announce his decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
