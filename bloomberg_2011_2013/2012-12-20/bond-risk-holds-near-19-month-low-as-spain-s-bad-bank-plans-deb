The cost to insure financial-company
debt from default held at a 19-month low in  Europe  as  Spain ’s
bad bank planned a  bond issue  over the holiday period and PSA
Peugeot Citroen said it refinanced $15 billion of debt.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers declined one basis
point to 137 at 2:15 p.m. in  London , the lowest since May 2011.
Contracts on  UBS AG (UBSN)  climbed four basis points to 92 after
 Switzerland ’s biggest lender was fined $1.5 billion for trying
to rig the London interbank offered rate.  Sareb, the 60 billion-euro ($79 billion) so-called bad bank
set up to purge soured real estate assets from Spanish lenders,
will issue senior and subordinated bonds next week, Chairman
Belen Romana said yesterday. Peugeot, Europe’s second-largest
carmaker, rose as much as  5.1 percent  in equity markets after it
said it reached an 11.5 billion-euro refinancing deal with about
20 creditor banks to boost liquidity at its lending unit.  “I’m surprised to see Spain’s bad bank will be in the
market next week,”  Bill Blain , a strategist at Mint Partners in
London, wrote in a note. Timing such an issue in the holiday
season is unusual, he said.  The creation of Sareb is a condition of Europe’s bailout of
the Spanish banking industry that was agreed to in July. Foreign
investors are still interested in buying into the bank, Sareb’s
Romana said.  Default swaps insuring Spain’s debt rose six basis points
to 286 basis points, while swaps on Italy climbed 11 basis
points to 268. The cost to insure the debt of Ireland jumped 10
basis points to 217, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Crossover Index  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings was little
changed at 444 basis points, the lowest since July 29, 2011. The
subordinated financial index fell two basis points to 234, the
lowest since May 2011, Bloomberg prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
