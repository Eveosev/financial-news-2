Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the worldâ€™s
largest consumer-products company, is closing hair-care research
centers in the U.K. and Japan as it combines operations to
develop new products more quickly.  The operations in Kobe, Japan, will move to Singapore, and
work from the facility in Egham, England, will be moved to the
U.S., Paul Fox, a company spokesman, said in a telephone
interview. The number of people involved in the moves, which
will be completed next year, still is being determined, Fox
said. The U.K. facility works on styling products, and the Japan
site focuses on conditioners.  Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald has centralized more
research and assembled a companywide team to bring products to
market more quickly as P&G works to regain market share.
Cincinnati-based P&G is introducing new hair-care products next
year, including Pantene Expert super-premium lines in January.  The maker of Olay skin-care products and Head & Shoulders
shampoo said in May it is moving its headquarters for skin-care,
cosmetics and personal care to  Singapore  to be closer to faster-
growing markets for the categories.  P&G also operates a shampoo research center in Cincinnati
and a coloring facility in  Germany .  P&G rose 0.7 percent to $69.82 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 4.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
