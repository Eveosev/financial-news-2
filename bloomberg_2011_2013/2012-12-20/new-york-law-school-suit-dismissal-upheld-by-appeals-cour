The dismissal of a lawsuit against
 New York Law School  filed by former students who accused the
school of inflating statistics on graduates’ jobs and pay was
upheld by an appeals court.  The students sued the school in August 2011, accusing it of
knowingly inflating employment and salary statistics to recruit
and retain students.  New York  State Supreme Court Justice Melvin L. Schweitzer threw out the suit in March, saying the school’s
marketing materials weren’t misleading and that the students had
enough information about job prospects from other sources.  An appeals court in Manhattan upheld dismissal of the suit
in a ruling today, saying that the school’s disclosures weren’t
false or misleading although they were “unquestionably
incomplete.”  “While we are troubled by the unquestionably less than
candid and incomplete disclosures, a party does not violate” a
New York state law prohibiting deceptive acts or practices “by
simply publishing truthful information and allowing consumers to
make their own assumptions about the nature of the
information,” Justice Rolando T. Acosta wrote in a unanimous
opinion.  New York Law School, founded in 1891, is one of the oldest
independent law schools in the U.S. with about 1,500 students,
according to its  website .  The case is Gomez-Jimenez v. New York Law School,
652226/2011, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
