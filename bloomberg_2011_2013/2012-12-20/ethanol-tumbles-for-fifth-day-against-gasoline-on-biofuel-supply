Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
futures weakened for a fifth day after supplies of the biofuel
climbed to the most in six months in a government report.  Ethanol futures sank a day after the Energy Department said
 stockpiles  reached 20.8 million barrels last week, 18 percent
more than a year earlier. Output has dropped 15 percent in 2012.  “It’s pretty ugly and doesn’t look to be getting better,”
said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago . “For the
near-term you just have too much supply and it’s going to take
some time to work through that.”  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline expanded to 54.63 cents a
gallon, the widest spread since Oct. 10, based on futures
settlement prices. It was 52.91 cents yesterday. The
differential has averaged 61.23 cents this year.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery declined 0.6 cents,
or 0.3 percent, to settle at $2.208 a gallon on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the lowest level since June 26. Futures have
fallen 8.3 percent this month.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  fell 6.5 cents
to $2.265 a gallon and in Chicago the additive decreased 6.5
cents to $2.185, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol on the West Coast slipped 5 cents to $2.315 a
gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel sank 4 cents to $2.275.  Gasoline for January delivery rose 1.12 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.7543 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn Falls  Corn for March delivery fell 6.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$6.965 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 29 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
32 cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  “The market’s signaling that we need some plant shutdowns
and to do it,” Kitt said.  If a plant were to be idled now, it probably wouldn’t be
able to return to production until spring approaches because of
challenges in restarting ethanol mills in cold weather, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
