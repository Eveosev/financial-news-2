Twitter Inc. named its first chief
operating officer since Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo
vacated the role two years ago, as the social site bolsters its
leadership team ahead of a possible initial public offering.  Ali Rowghani, who had served as chief financial officer
since early 2010, has been appointed COO, Costolo wrote in a
 post  on the site yesterday. Mike Gupta, who joined last month
after leaving  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , has been named CFO, Costolo wrote.  The move frees Rowghani, whose broad range of
responsibilities already included partnerships and global
expansion, to focus on growth and increasing competition with
social-network rival  Facebook Inc. (FB)  As CFO, Gupta will lead
preparations for an eventual IPO, which may be one of the most
anticipated offerings of the next few years.  Rowghani played a key role in lining up the venture capital
round from DST Global and other existing investors that valued
San Francisco-based Twitter at about $8 billion last year.  The executive has been vocal in internal debates such as
whether to form a partnership or joint venture with a local
company to help lure users in  Japan . Rowghani pushed for the
company to stay independent to retain control over its future, a
person with knowledge of the deliberations said earlier this
year. Rowghani’s view prevailed.  Rowghani previously worked at Walt Disney Co.’s Pixar,
where he was CFO and a close colleague of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  co-founder
and Pixar leader Steve Jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
