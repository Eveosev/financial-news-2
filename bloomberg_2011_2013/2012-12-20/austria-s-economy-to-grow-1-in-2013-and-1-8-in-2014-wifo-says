Austria’s economy  is projected to
grow 1 percent next year and 1.8 percent in 2014, the state-
supported  Wifo research institute  said.  “The perspectives for the Austrian economy have improved
slightly compared to our forecast from September,” Wifo said in
an e-mailed statement today, adding that the estimate is “still
affected by a high degree of uncertainty” due to the sovereign-
debt crisis in the euro area.  Wifo today released its first forecast for 2014. Its
estimates for economic growth of 0.6 percent this year and 1
percent in 2013 are in line with the institute’s September
forecast.  “The Austrian economy may have stagnated in the second
half of 2012,” Wifo said in the statement. At the same time,
“there’s a reasonable expectation for this period of weakness
to be over soon” and for the Austrian economy to “return to a
growth path.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
