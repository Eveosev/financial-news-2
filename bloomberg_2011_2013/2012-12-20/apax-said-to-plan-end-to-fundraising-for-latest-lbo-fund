Apax Partners LLP, the private-
equity firm headed by Martin Halusa, plans to end its
fundraising effort in March after almost two years of seeking
money in a crowded market, according to two people familiar with
the matter.  The private-equity firm, which is seeking 9 billion euros
($11.9 billion) for Apax VIII, has so far raised about 5 billion
euros, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
information is private. The fund began raising money in May 2011
and held an initial closing in March at 4.3 billion euros.  Todd Fogarty, a spokesman at Kekst & Co., declined to
comment on behalf of Apax.  Apax is among a number of private-equity firms facing
headwinds as investors have less money to commit to buyout
funds. KKR & Co. had gathered about $700 million for its latest
North American fund since February, bringing the total to $6.2
billion, the firm said in October. Providence Equity Partners
Inc., which is seeking as much as $6 billion, told investors in
a meeting in October that it expects to close the fund at $5
billion.  The amount sought by Apax for its latest fund is less than
the 11.2 billion euros the prior fund gathered in 2007. That
fund was producing a 1.1 times multiple and 3.28 percent net
internal rate of return as of June 30, according to performance
data from the Washington State Investment Board.  The news about the expected final close was reported
yesterday by the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
