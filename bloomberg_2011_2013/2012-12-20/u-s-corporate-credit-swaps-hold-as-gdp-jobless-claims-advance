A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk was little changed after data showed the U.S. economy grew
more than expected while jobless claims rose for the first time
in five weeks.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, eased 0.1
basis point to a mid-price of 89.8 basis points at 9 a.m. in New
York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, exceeding the highest projection in a Bloomberg
survey and compared with a previously estimated 2.7 percent
gain, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
 Washington . First-time claims for unemployment insurance
payments rose 17,000 to 361,000 in the week ended Dec. 15,
according to the Labor Department. Improving economic data may
ease investor concern that the global economy will falter,
hindering companiesâ€™ ability to repay debt.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
