Germany ’s longer-maturity bunds
rose, snapping a three-day decline, as the nation cut its
sovereign-bond sales for 2013 to the lowest in five years.  Thirty-year securities led gains, with yields dropping the
most in three weeks, as the Federal Finance Agency said Germany
plans to sell 250 billion euros ($331 billion) of bonds next
year, from 255 billion euros in 2012. French  government bonds 
advanced after the nation also reduced next year’s borrowing
requirement. The debt of so-called core countries was
underpinned by speculation U.S. leaders will struggle to reach
an agreement on the so-called fiscal cliff.  “Bunds traded up a little on the release” of the German
debt calendar, said  Christoph Rieger , head of fixed-rate
strategy at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “Given the shortening
of reduction in supply in the longer part of the curve, this has
supported the market,” referring to securities with a maturity
of more than 10 years.  German 30-year yields dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.28 percent at 4:24 p.m.  London  time. The
2.5 percent bund maturing in July 2044 rose 0.83, or 8.30 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 104.925. The rate declined as
much as five basis points, the most since Dec. 5. The 10-year
yield fell one basis point to 1.42 percent.  Debt Sales  Germany plans to auction as much as 173 billion euros of
bonds and 77 billion euros of bills in 2013, the Finance Agency
said. It sold a record 334 billion euros of debt in 2009, up
from 220 billion euros a year earlier.  The reduction in debt sales is “good for Germany and the
wider market,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European interest-
rate strategy at Societe Generale SA in Paris. Selling fewer
bonds in 2013 and focusing more on the five-year sector where
the agency can expect to pay lower  interest rates  is also
positive, O’Hagan said.  France cut its borrowings in 2013 to 169 billion euros as
President  Francois Hollande  squeezes the  budget deficit . The
updated figure is 1 billion euros less than Paris-based Agence
France Tresor’s Sept. 28 estimate. Yields on 10-year securities
fell two basis points to 1.99 percent.  “This is a good sign that perhaps we have seen the worst
in terms of fiscal stress in the region,” said  Michael Leister ,
a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. “The
reduction in issuance will be positive for the market and we
hope the trend will continue. Weak growth is the biggest risk
facing the region as it may derail fiscal reforms and push up
borrowing needs again.”  Fiscal Cliff  The U.S. White House said yesterday that talks between
President  Barack Obama  and Republican House Speaker  John Boehner 
over ways to avoid the fiscal cliff of more than $600 billion in
tax increases and spending cuts are regressing.  German  producer prices  slid 0.1 percent last month after
stagnating in October, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today. An index of  consumer confidence  in the 17-
nation currency bloc increased to minus 26.6 this month from
minus 26.9 in November, the European Commission in Brussels said
in an initial estimate today. Last month’s reading was the
lowest since May 2009.  Volatility on Belgian debt was the highest among euro-area
nations tracked by Bloomberg, followed by that of Austria and
Ireland, according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-
year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  The yield on Belgium’s 10-year bond fell as much as six
basis points to 2.04 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began
compiling the data from 1993.  German bunds returned 3.7 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
debt earned 21 percent and French bonds gained 10 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
