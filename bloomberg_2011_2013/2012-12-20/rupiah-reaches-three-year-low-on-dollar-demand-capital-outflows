Indonesia ’s rupiah touched a three-
year low on speculation corporate demand for dollars exceeds
supply as foreign funds pull money from local assets and the
current-account deficit is forecast to widen.  The  shortfall  in the current account may be 2.3 percent of
gross domestic product this quarter, which would be the most
since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1997, the central
bank said on Dec. 11. Overseas investors sold $51 million more
local stocks than they bought this month and reduced their
government debt holdings by 430 billion rupiah ($44 million),
exchange and finance ministry data show.  “The rupiah will tend to weaken as long as the current-
account deficit continues, which drives strong demand for
dollars,” said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank
CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “Considering the slowdown in capital
inflows recently, the rupiah will stay near 9,700 through year-
end.”  The rupiah fell 0.1 percent to 9,660 per dollar as of 9:01
a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. It declined by as much as 0.9 percent to 9,735
earlier, the weakest level since Sept. 29, 2009. The rupiah has
lost 6.1 percent this year, the worst performance among  Asia ’s
11 most-active currencies after the Japanese yen.  Bank Indonesia  will remain in the market to guard the local
currency, Governor Darmin Nasution said on Dec. 10.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was steady at 5.7
percent, compared with 13.2 percent at the end of 2011.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent notes maturing in
May 2022 was little changed at 5.19 percent, the lowest level
since Feb. 15, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
