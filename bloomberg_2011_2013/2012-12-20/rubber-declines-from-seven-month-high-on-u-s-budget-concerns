Rubber retreated from the highest
level in more than seven months on concern that U.S. budget
talks were deteriorating and as gains in the Japanese currency
reduced demand for yen-based contracts.  Rubber for delivery in May lost as much as 2 percent to 282
yen a kilogram ($3,348 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange, before trading at 283.3 yen at 12:38 a.m. local time.
The most-active contract settled at 287.7 yen yesterday, the
highest price at close since May 10. Futures have gained 7.7
percent this year.  House Speaker  John Boehner ’s budget proposal would put
“too big a burden on the middle class” and President  Barack
Obama  would veto it, according to White House Communications
Director  Dan Pfeiffer . Failure to reach a compromise would
trigger next month more than $600 billion in spending cuts and
tax increases, the so-called fiscal cliff.  “The fiscal cliff negotiation is now in trouble, and that
has made the  market sentiment  bearish,” said Naohiro Niimura, a
partner at research company Market Risk Advisory in Tokyo.  The yen strengthened against all of its 16 major
counterparts on the U.S. budget impasse and as the
Bank of Japan ends a two-day meeting today, at which it is
expected to expand monetary stimulus. Crude oil, used to make
synthetic rubber, fell from the highest level in two months.  Rubber for May delivery fell 1.7 percent to 24,845  yuan 
($3,989) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board rose 0.5 percent to 96.65 baht ($3.16) a kilogram
yesterday, said the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
