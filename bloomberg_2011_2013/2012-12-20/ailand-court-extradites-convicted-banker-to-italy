Thailand’s  Criminal Court  ordered
the extradition of an Italian banker convicted of laundering
drug money through New York pizzerias who was arrested earlier
this year at a Bangkok airport.  An Italian court in 2009 sentenced Vito Roberto Palazzolo,
65, to nine years in prison for his role in laundering money
from proceeds of drug trafficking and cigarette smuggling
conducted by the Cosa Nostra Sicilian mafia, according to
 Interpol . He was also accused of closely associating with the
organization’s leaders.  Palazzolo maintains a  website  through which he denies
wrongdoing, and says he unknowingly invested funds for the mafia
in  Switzerland  in 1982. The transaction was part of a scheme
dubbed “The Pizza Connection,” in which the mafia sold heroin
through  New York  pizza parlors and laundered the money in
Switzerland, according to his website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
