Thailand ’s sovereign notes rose,
snapping a four-day decline, before the final bond sale of 2012
and after overseas investors bought the most debt in more than
two weeks. The baht was little changed.  The Bank of Thailand is set to sell 30 billion baht ($979.4
million) of securities due in 2014 today and short-term bills on
Dec. 25, according to the auction schedule compiled by Bloomberg.
Foreign funds bought the equivalent of $190 million more of the
nation’s debt than they sold yesterday, data from the Thai Bond
Market Association show.  “Yields will continue to go lower especially because of
the New Year, when foreign inflows tend to pick up seasonally,”
said  Rohit Arora , a Singapore-based fixed-income strategist at
Barclays Plc. There are market expectations that there’ll be no
supply in the first two weeks of next year, he said.  The yield on the 5.125 percent bonds due March 2018 dropped
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.27 percent as
of 9:40 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Thai government securities have returned 2.5 percent this year,
compared with more than 5 percent in the previous two, an index
compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc shows.  The treasury issued 19 billion baht of 2017 debt yesterday
at an average yield of 3.19 percent and 8 billion baht of notes
maturing in 2041 at 4.30 percent. Five-year securities in the
U.S. yield 0.76 percent, while those in  Japan  pay 0.18 percent.  The baht traded at 30.63 per dollar in Bangkok, compared
with 30.61 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has advanced 3.1 percent this year.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
exchange-rate swings used to price options, slipped three basis
points to 3.89 percent. The rate has dropped 264 basis points
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
