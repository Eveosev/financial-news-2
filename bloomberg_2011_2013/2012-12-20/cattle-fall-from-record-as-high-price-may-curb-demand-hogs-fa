Cattle futures fell from a record on
speculation that high U.S. prices will curb consumer demand for
beef. Hogs also declined.  Wholesale-beef prices that have rallied 8 percent since the
end of July dropped for a third day to $1.9198 a pound, the
lowest since Nov. 9, government data show. Cattle futures are up
17 percent since the end of April, curbing prospects for beef
demand.  “With cattle prices, I think there’s a limit,”  Jason Britt , the president of brokerage Central States Commodities
Inc. in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , said by telephone. “Prices get
to a point where they ration out demand, and meat’s going to be
the same way. People are saying that if prices continue the way
they have been, steak’s going to become the new lobster.”  Cattle futures for February delivery slumped 0.6 percent to
settle at $1.335 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1.345, matching
yesterday’s record.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement slid 0.6 percent
to $1.5485 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.1 percent to
86.45 cents a pound. The price is up 2.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
