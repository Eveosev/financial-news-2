Polish 10-year bond yields fell for
a second day, reaching a record low, and the zloty advanced
against the euro.  The yield on notes due in October 2023 fell four basis
points to 3.83 percent at 12:31 p.m. in Warsaw. The zloty added
as much as 0.2 percent against the single European currency
before trading up less than 0.1 percent to 4.0721.  As central banks from the U.S. to  Japan  and the euro area
pledge to keep borrowing costs low to support their economies,
investors are buying emerging-market bonds in search of higher
returns. The yield on  Poland ’s 10-year bond in zloty is poised
for its biggest annual retreat in a decade while the country’s
cost of borrowing in dollars is headed for a record decline this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Actions from major global central banks maintain a
positive backdrop for Polish bonds,”  Rafal Benecki , chief
economist for Poland at ING Groep NV in Warsaw, wrote in an e-
mailed note. “The zloty has a chance to appreciate to 4.05 from
the current level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
