Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) ’s Chief
Financial Officer  Craig White  left  Australia ’s largest surf-wear
maker as the board considers a A$527 million ($553 million)
takeover offer.  White, who’s served in the job since 2005, left the company
today with the CFO of its Americas unit Peter Bryant to act in
the role while the company searches for a replacement, Gold
Coast, Australia-based Billabong said in a regulatory statement
today. The company didn’t provide a reason for the departure.  Billabong shares have fallen 18 percent over the past two
days amid investor concerns that a A$1.10 a share takeover bid
from Sycamore Partners LLC and Paul Naude, the head of the
company’s Americas division, may be cut or fail. The company has
replaced its chief executive officer and chairman and seen  three
board members  step down over the past year as it racked up its
first annual loss since it first sold shares to the public in
2000.  “Billabong will shortly implement a new organizational and
reporting structure,” the company said in a regulatory
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
