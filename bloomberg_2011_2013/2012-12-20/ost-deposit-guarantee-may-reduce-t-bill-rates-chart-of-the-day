Treasury-bill rates are poised to
decline as an expanded guarantee ends for some bank deposits,
according to Pavilion Global Markets Ltd. strategists.  The Transaction Account Guarantee Program, or TAG, enables
U.S. banks to provide unlimited insurance on deposits that don’t
pay interest. The program, which began in the fourth quarter of
2008, is scheduled to lapse at year-end. The limit will revert
to $250,000 for each account.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the amount of money held in
these non-interest-bearing accounts has jumped 71 percent since
the ceiling was removed, according to Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. data. Money-market fund assets dropped 30 percent during
the period, according to the  Investment Company Institute .  “TAG facilitated the exodus from money-market funds and
into other safe assets,”  Pierre Lapointe , Pavilion’s head of
global strategy and research, and two colleagues wrote in a
report two days ago.  A reversal may have already begun. Money-fund assets have
risen 2.7 percent this quarter to $2.65 trillion, according to
the institute’s data. The increase would be the biggest for a
full quarter in four years.  Losing the unlimited deposit guarantee “will lead
institutions to reassess the safety” of the accounts and move
some money into Treasury bills, the Montreal-based strategists
wrote. They expect the shift to push  interest rates  lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
