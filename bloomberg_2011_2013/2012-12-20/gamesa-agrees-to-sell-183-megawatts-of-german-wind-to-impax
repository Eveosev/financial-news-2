Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) , Spain’s
biggest maker of  wind turbines , agreed to sell 183 megawatts of
wind projects under development in Germany to  Impax Asset
Management Group Plc. (IPX)   Gamesa will build the projects with its 2-megawatt and 4.5-
megawatt turbines from 2013 to 2015, the Zamudio-based company
said today in a statement. Gamesa and Impax plan to finish
discussions on the sale in the next two months.  The sale signed as a “heads of terms” agreement is part
of Gamesa’s new strategy to keep its  capital requirements  down
by inviting financial investors to buy the projects it then
builds and develops. Gamesa already sold a wind farm in France
to London-based Impax, with plans to start building at the site
in the Limousin region.  “This transaction represents a major step forward in our
strategy for this business as outlined in our business plan,
which will enable us to develop wind farms, safeguarding our
role as a technology company,” Gamesa Business Chief Executive
Officer Xabier Etxeberria said in the statement.  The companies are considering similar agreements in other
regions, according to Gamesa. The agreement also includes a 15-
year operation and maintenance service provision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
