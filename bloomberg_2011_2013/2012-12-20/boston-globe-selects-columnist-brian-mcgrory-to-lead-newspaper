The Boston Globe named Brian McGrory
as its next editor, selecting a columnist with 23 years of
experience at the newspaper.  McGrory will report to Publisher Christopher M. Mayer, the
newspaper owned by  New York Times Co. (NYT)  said today in a statement.
He will run the newspaper’s website in addition to the print
publication.  The new editor takes over the paper as it seeks to make up
for declining advertising sales by asking readers to pay for
access to its articles online. Boston Globe’s print readership
has declined with average weekday circulation falling 9.2
percent to 180,919 and Sunday editions dropping 8.7 percent to
323,345. The newspaper started charging readers online in
October 2011 and reported 26,000 paying subscribers as of the
end of September this year.  The Globe, seeking to produce stories that will compel
readers to pay for its content, selected as editor a journalist
who has focused most of his career on local coverage. After six
years as a columnist, McGrory was named an associate editor in
2004. He then became deputy managing editor for local news in
2007, resuming his column three years later.  Times Co.  fell  less than 1 percent to $8.79 at the close in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
