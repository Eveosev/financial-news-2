Russia , the world’s third-biggest
 wheat exporter  last season, has the cheapest agricultural lands
among six grain exporting regions analyzed by the SovEcon
consultancy.  Russia’s most expensive agricultural land, in the southern
Krasnodar region, can be bought for about $1,711 per hectare
(2.47 acres), less than land in the U.S., the east or west of
the European Union, Brazil and Argentina, according to market
research from SovEcon.  The prices compare with an average $11,250 a hectare in
France and Germany, $9,000 a hectare in the U.S. and Brazil,
$7,000 in Argentina and $4,500 in eastern members of the EU,
SovEcon said in its first farmland price survey.  The U.S., Argentina, EU, and  Brazil  are the first, second,
fifth and seventh biggest exporters of grains respectively this
season, while Russia is the ninth biggest, U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates show. Canada, Australia and Ukraine rank
third, fourth and sixth, and  India  is eighth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
