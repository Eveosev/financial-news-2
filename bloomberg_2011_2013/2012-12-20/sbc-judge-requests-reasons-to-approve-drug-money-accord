HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and U.S.
prosecutors were asked by a judge to submit a brief giving
reasons he should approve the bank’s $1.9 billion settlement of
money-laundering charges over drug cartel-related transfers.  “My suggestion is you present to the court a document that
demonstrates why I should accept the agreement,” U.S. District
Judge John Gleeson said today at a court hearing in  Brooklyn ,
 New York . “There’s been some publicized criticism of this. I
think you should feel free to address it.”  The U.S.  Justice Department  said this month that the
London-based bank agreed to pay a $1.25 billion forfeiture and
$665 million in civil penalties to settle money-laundering
charges. The government alleged the London-based bank failed to
monitor more than $670 billion in wire transfers and more than
$9.4 billion in purchases of U.S. dollars from HSBC  Mexico .  Lack of oversight enabled the Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico
and the Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia to move more than
$881 million in proceeds through HSBC’s U.S. unit from 2006 to
2010, according to the government.  The bank, Europe’s largest, wouldn’t face further criminal
proceedings related to the probe under a deferred-prosecution
agreement, in which the government allows a target to avoid
charges by meeting certain conditions.  The case is U.S. v. HSBC Bank USA NA, 1:12-cr-00763, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
