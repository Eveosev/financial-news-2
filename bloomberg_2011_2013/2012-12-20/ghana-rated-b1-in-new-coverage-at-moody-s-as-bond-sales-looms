Ghana  was rated B1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, four levels below investment grade, as the
rating company initiated coverage of the African country that
plans to sell bonds abroad next year.  “Ghana’s robust growth prospects” underpin the rating,
Edward Al-Hussainy, a New York-based analyst at Moody’s, wrote
in a report issued today. The West African nation’s economy, the
second-biggest in the region, will grow 8.2 percent this year
and 7.8 percent in 2013, according to the International Monetary
Fund.  Moody’s B1 rating puts Ghana in line with Zambia, Kenya and
Lebanon. The country was already rated an equivalent B+ by Fitch
Ratings and one step lower, at B, by Standard & Poor’s.  Ghana, which issued the first Eurobonds in sub-Saharan
Africa outside of South Africa in 2007, may sell a further $750
million, Deputy Finance Minister Seth Terkper said by phone from
Accra Dec. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
