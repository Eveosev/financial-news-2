Egypt  resumed pumping natural gas to
Jordan at 250 million cubic feet a day as stipulated under an
agreement between the countries, the state-run Petra news agency
cited Jordan’s Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour as saying.  Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil, who is visiting
Amman, said after meeting Ensour that the natural gas agreement
with Jordan is already working, adding that the energy industry
in Egypt faces challenges that place pressure on Egypt’s ability
to meets its needs.  Jordan, one of the region’s smallest economies, imports 95
percent of its energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
