The U.S. Justice Department said it
won’t challenge a proposal by seven nuclear power plant
operators to join in buying certain supplies and services.  Joint procurement by STARS Alliance LLC will help the
operators cut costs and may benefit consumers by reducing
electricity prices, Renata B. Hesse, acting assistant attorney
general in charge of the department’s antitrust division, said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The purchasing proposal meets antitrust guidelines for
collaboration among competitors, the department said in the
statement.  The guidelines provide an “antitrust safety zone” in
which regulators are unlikely to challenge a joint venture when
the market shares of the venture and its members don’t exceed
20 percent of each relevant market. STARS said its members
collectively account for less than 20 percent of the markets in
which it proposed joint purchasing.  The members are Union Electric Co.,  Arizona  Public Service
Co., Luminant Generation Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Co.,
Southern California Edison Co., STP Nuclear Operating Co. and
Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
