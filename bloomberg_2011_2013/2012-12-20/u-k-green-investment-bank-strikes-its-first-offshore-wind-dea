The U.K.’s Green Investment Bank
struck its first offshore wind power-funding deal, contributing
to a 224 million-pound ($365 million) loan for a facility off
the coast of  England  that’s the largest operating in the world.  Banco Santander SA,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Siemens Bank GmbH are also participating
in the seven-year loan, according to a joint statement today
from the GIB, other lenders to the project and its owners.  The bank opened in Edinburgh Nov. 28 with 3 billion pounds
of state funds to spur financing for low-carbon technology. It
already announced investments in an anaerobic digestion plant in
northeast England and fitting out energy-efficient buildings.  Today’s loan will refinance the purchase of 24.8 percent of
the 1 billion-pound Walney facility held by Dutch pension
administrator PGGM NV and Ampere Equity Fund, a renewable-energy
unit managed by Triodos Bank NV’s Triodos Investment Management.  The 367-megawatt farm off Cumbria is the world’s largest
offshore wind farm in operation, supplying as many as 340,000
homes a year with power. Other stakes are held by  SSE Plc (SSE) , with
25.1 percent, and Dong Energy A/S, with 50.1 percent.  Green Giraffe Energy Bankers advised PGGM and Ampere.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
