The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  from non-payment rose after dipping to
the lowest in 19 months yesterday, according to prices from
credit-default swap traders and data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan advanced 1 basis point to 108 basis
points as of 8:44 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Credit
Agricole SA. The index closed at 107 yesterday, its least since
May 2011, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 0.5 of a basis
point to 121 as of 11:44 a.m in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices
show. The index closed at 120.2 basis points on Dec. 18, its
lowest since August last year, according to CMA, which is owned
by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 2.5 basis points to 159
basis points as of 9:34 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The gauge, which has ranged from 136.2 basis points to
229.5 basis points this year, closed at 157.4 yesterday, its
least since April, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
