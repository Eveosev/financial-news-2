KKR & Co.’s Energy Future Holdings
Corp., formerly known as TXU Corp., is seeking to extend the
maturity date on $3.8 billion of first-lien loans that come due
October 2014, according to a report by CreditSights Inc.  The debt was quoted at 74.5 cents on the dollar today, up
from 69.7 cents on Dec. 6, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. Energy Future’s $15.4 billion  term loan  due October
2017 was quoted at 67.6 cents today.  The offer to amend and extend the loan also boosted the
price of the Dallas-based energy producer’s unsecured debt by 33
percent, CreditSights analyst  Andy DeVries  wrote in the note
dated yesterday.  Energy Future, which was taken private by KKR, TPG Capital
and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners five years ago in the largest
leveraged buyout in history, extended the maturities on more
than $17.8 billion of loans in April 2011.  The company has posted seven consecutive quarterly  losses 
and will face a “material restructuring” in the next 12
months, Moody’s Investors Service said in a Dec. 5 report. As
its long-term  borrowings  soared to $37.4 billion through Sept.
30 from $10.6 billion before the buyout, natural  gas prices  have
plunged about 75 percent from their 2008 peak. The price of
electricity in the Texas market is linked to natural gas costs.  Allan Koenig , a spokesman for Energy Future, declined to
comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
