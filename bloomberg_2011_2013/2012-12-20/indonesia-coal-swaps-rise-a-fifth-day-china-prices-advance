 Swaps prices advanced for a fifth
day for thermal coal from  Indonesia , the world’s largest
exporter of the fuel for power stations, according to Ginga
Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the first
quarter of 2013 rose 60 cents to $64.15 a metric ton on a net-
as-received basis yesterday, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The
January contract also climbed 60 cents to $64.15 a ton.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the first
quarter increased $1.10 to $85.10 a ton on a net-as-received
basis, the energy broker said. The swap for January advanced
$1.45 to $85.10.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period. About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is
classified as sub-bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower
carbon content reduce the heating value compared with better-
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
