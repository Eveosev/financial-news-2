Cocoa fell to the lowest level in
almost six months in  London  on speculation supplies from West
Africa are improving just as top growers  Ivory Coast  and Ghana
started selling their next crop. Sugar slid.  Bean exports from Ivory Coast’s port of  San Pedro  climbed
40 percent last month to 60,931 metric tons, according to data
from the harbor. Cocoa arrivals at the country’s ports rose 6.4
percent to 595,000 tons from the start of the season on Oct. 1
to Dec. 16, according to KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities
Risk Analysis. Both top producer Ivory Coast and second-ranking
Ghana have already started to sell their next crop.  “The overall supply side picture has been improving as of
late with favorable weather over West Africa, good survival
rates, good mid-crop outlook, little to no Harmattan,” Eric Sivry, the head of agriculture options brokerage at Marex
Spectron Group, said in a report e-mailed today. “This combined
with the announcement of new crop selling by Ivory Coast and the
presence of  Ghana  led cocoa prices towards the bottom end of the
recent range.”  The Harmattan winds coming from the desert are common in
West Africa in December and January and can damage the cocoa
crop.  Cocoa for March delivery fell 0.6 percent to 1,475 pounds
($2,399) a ton by 11:03 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London, the lowest
for a most-active contract since June 26. The commodity was
still up 6.9 percent this year. Cocoa for March delivery fell
0.6 percent to $2,344 a ton ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . It
gained 11 percent this year.  Ivory Coast and Ghana usually sell part of their crop
before the harvest starts. That creates additional selling
pressure on cocoa traded on  futures markets . The 2013-14 season
in both countries will begin in October.  Refined Sugar  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery slid 0.8
percent to $513.50 a ton in London. It fell 15 percent this
year. Raw sugar for March delivery fell 1 percent to 19.04 cents
a pound on ICE. It lost 18 percent this year.  Robusta coffee for March delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
$1,886 a ton in London, 4.2 percent higher this year. Arabica
coffee for March delivery was down 0.9 percent to $1.4355 a
pound in New York. It’s fallen 37 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
