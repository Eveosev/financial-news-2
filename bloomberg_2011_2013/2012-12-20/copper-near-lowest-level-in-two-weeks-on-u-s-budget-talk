Copper declined to the lowest level
in three weeks amid concerns that budget negotiations
deteriorated in the U.S. Zinc, lead, nickel and tin also fell.  Metal for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.8
percent to $7,863 a metric ton, the lowest since Nov. 29, before
trading at $7,868.25 on the London Metal Exchange at 1:58 p.m.
in Shanghai. Copper has climbed 3.5 percent this year. The
contract for March delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell 1.5 percent to 56,770 yuan ($9,111) a ton.  House Speaker  John Boehner ’s “Plan B” would put “too big
a burden on the middle class” and President  Barack Obama  would
veto it, White House Communications Director  Dan Pfeiffer  said.
House Republican leaders are considering giving members a chance
to vote on spending cuts to firm up support for Boehner’s tax
measure, said a Republican lawmaker and a congressional aide who
spoke on condition of anonymity.  “U.S. fiscal concerns are affecting market sentiment when
the fundamental picture remains lackluster,” said  Li Peng , an
analyst at Guotai Junan Futures Co.  LME stockpiles expanded for a 10th session to 304,900 tons
yesterday, the longest rising streak since May 2011. Copper for
immediate delivery traded at a discount of $28.50 a ton to the
contract for delivery in three months. The so-called  contango 
was $28.75 on Dec. 18, the widest since July 2010.  March futures on the Comex in  New York  dropped 0.6 percent
to $3.5855 a pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
