India ’s rupee snapped a two-day gain
on concern stalled U.S. budget talks will damp demand for
riskier assets, while a strike by the Asian nation’s state-run
bank staff may weigh on trading volumes.  Three banking unions called for a strike today to protest
against a bill passed by parliament on Dec. 18 that may spur
expansion in the industry and increased competition. Officials
from President  Barack Obama ’s administration told leaders of
business and financial services groups that negotiations with
House Speaker John Boehner have deteriorated in the past 24
hours, a person familiar with the meeting said.  “The currency will trade weaker today because of the
concerns from abroad,” said Kamlakar Rao, Mumbai-based head of
foreign-exchange at state-owned Allahabad Bank. “The strike
will keep volumes suppressed and so any moves in the currency
may be exaggerated.”  The rupee declined 0.3 percent to 54.7200 per dollar as of
9:53 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has fallen 3 percent this year after plunging 16
percent in 2011. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 10.18 percent. The
rate has dropped 182 basis points in 2012.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.63 per
dollar, compared with 55.50 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.60 versus 55.42. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
