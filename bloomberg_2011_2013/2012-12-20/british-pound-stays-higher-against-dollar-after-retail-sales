The U.K. pound stayed higher against
the dollar and was little changed versus the euro after a report
showed retail sales were unchanged in November.  Sterling was 0.1 percent stronger at $1.6263 against the
dollar at 9:38 a.m. London time. The pound traded at 81.38
pence, from 81.41 pence yesterday.  Sales including fuel were unchanged from October, when they
fell 0.7 percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said today
in London. The median forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 0.4 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
