Foreign buyers reduced investments
in Australian state government bonds for the first time since
the second quarter of 2011 after the biggest borrower was
downgraded by Fitch Ratings and yields dropped to record lows.  Non-resident investors lowered their stake in bonds issued
in  Australia  by regional governments to A$68.9 billion ($72
billion) as of Sept. 30, from A$70 billion on June 30, according
to data published by the  Bureau of Statistics  in Sydney today.
Local banks boosted their holdings to A$70 billion from A$60.5
billion, the first time they exceeded foreign holdings since the
third quarter of 2005.  Semi-government debt, as the borrowings of Australia’s
states and territories are known, returned 7.75 percent this
year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Average yields on state debt fell as low as 3.31 percent in
October, the least in Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
starting in 1992.  Fitch reduced Queensland state’s ranking to AA from AA+ on
Sept. 13. Moody’s Investors Service revised the outlook on its
Aa1 rating to negative from stable on Nov 26.  Standard & Poor’s 
currently has the state at AA+, the second-highest grade, with a
stable outlook.  Queensland has about A$77 billion of outstanding bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
