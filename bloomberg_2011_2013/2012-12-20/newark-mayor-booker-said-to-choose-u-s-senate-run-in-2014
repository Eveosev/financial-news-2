Newark Mayor  Cory Booker , a rising
Democratic star who spoke at his party’s national convention,
has chosen a 2014 run for U.S. Senate over a challenge to
Republican Governor Chris Christie next year, according to three
people familiar with his plans.  Booker, 43, opted against challenging the New Jersey
governor, who is seeking re-election. Instead, the mayor will
seek the seat now held by Democratic Senator  Frank Lautenberg ,
an 88-year-old serving his fifth term, said the people, who
weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the mayor’s decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
