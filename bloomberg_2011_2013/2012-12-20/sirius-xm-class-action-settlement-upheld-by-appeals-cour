Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI)  and its
customers won appeals court approval of a class-action lawsuit
settlement challenged by some satellite radio subscribers who
claimed they got too little and lawyers too much.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Manhattan today affirmed a
ruling by a lower court that approved the suit settlement,
valued at $180 million. Plaintiffs’ lawyers were awarded $13
million in fees.  “Competent counsel appeared on both sides, and settlement
was reached only after contentious negotiations,” the appeals
judges said in their opinion. “Thus the district court did not
abuse its discretion when it presumed the proposed settlement
was procedurally fair.”  Subscribers sued Sirius XM Radio in 2009, claiming that it
violated antitrust law when it raised prices after Sirius
Satellite Radio acquired its only competitor, XM Satellite
Radio, in 2008. They said Sirius broke promises it made to win
merger approval from the Federal Communications Commission.  Sirius XM argued that the price increases were justified to
cover higher costs.  In August 2011 Sirius XM won District Court approval of a
settlement before a trial was to take place. The accord provided
for an unchanged subscription price for five months ending last
Dec. 31.  The appeal is Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio, 11-3696, Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit ( Manhattan ). The lower-court
case is Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio, 09-10035, U.S. District
Court, District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
