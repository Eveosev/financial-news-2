U.S. house prices rose 5.6 percent
in the 12 months through October as the housing market recovers,
the  Federal Housing Finance Agency  said.  Prices climbed 0.5 percent from September, the FHFA said
today in a report from  Washington . That was more than the 0.3
percent average  estimate  of 16 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  U.S. home values have increased this year as record-low
 borrowing  costs and improving employment bolster consumer demand
and the  supply  of homes on the market shrinks.  The FHFA data, which is based on sales of single-family
houses with a mortgage backed by  Fannie Mae  or  Freddie Mac ,
doesnâ€™t provide a specific price. The  median price  of an
existing single-family home was $178,600 in October, up 11
percent from a year earlier and 0.2 percent higher than
September, the National Association of Realtors said on Nov. 20.  U.S. home values gained 6 percent this year to an estimated
$23.7 trillion, according to an analysis released today by
Seattle-based Zillow Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
