European gasoline climbed for a
fourth day as Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought on the barge market.  Gasoil advanced to the highest level in more than two weeks
on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange. The market moved into
backwardation, a structure that signals near-term scarcity of
supply or rising demand.  Light Products  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area traded
from $955 to $957 a ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That
compares with deals at $950 and $951 yesterday.  Gunvor Group Ltd. and Trafigura Beheer BV sold the Eurobob
grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel. Shell,
Vitol Group and Cargill Inc. bought shipments of 1,000 and 2,000
tons.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , fell for a
second day to $4.93 a barrel as of 10:53 a.m. London time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and
products broker. It was at $5 yesterday.  Gasoline demand in the U.K. fell 5.6 percent to 1.1 million
tons in October from a year earlier, data from the Department of
Energy and Climate Change showed.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, widened to $3.41 a
barrel, the biggest spread since Dec. 14, PVM data showed. It
was $3.28 the previous session.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for January delivery rose as much as $8, or 0.9
percent, to $945 a ton, the highest since Dec. 4, and was at
$944.25 as of 1:20 p.m. local time. The February contract was at
a 25 cent discount to the front month.  The market had traded in contango, where near-term supplies
being cheaper than later-dated deliveries, for most of the past
28 days.  Gasoil’s crack  increased to $16.36 a barrel versus $15.92
as of 4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent fell 10 cents to $110.26 a
barrel on the ICE exchange.  Diesel consumption in the U.K. rose 0.3 percent in October
to 1.8 million tons from the same month last year, DECC said.  Rhine River  The Rhine River section near Karlsruhe, where the 310,000
barrel-a-day Miro refinery is located, opened after a one-day
closure, Thomas May, an official from the Wasserschutzpolizei,
said by phone. Barge traffic is subject to speed restrictions in
that area because of high water levels, May said.  The barge clearance level on the  Europe ’s busiest inland
waterway at Rheinfelden close to the Swiss border fell to 6.94
meters today, a second straight drop, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
