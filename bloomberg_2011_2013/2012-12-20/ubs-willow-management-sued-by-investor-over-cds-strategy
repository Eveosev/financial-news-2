UBS Willow Management LLC was sued
by an investor in its Willow Fund who claims it deviated from an
announced strategy of investing in debt securities by trading in
credit default swaps.  Ken Boudreau asked for class-action status for the suit,
filed today in federal court in  Manhattan  on behalf of other
Willow Fund investors. He also sued owners of the joint venture
-- Bond Street Capital LLC and UBS Alternative and Quantitative
Investments LLC -- as well as the fund’s managing member, UBS
Fund Advisor LLC.  “The Willow Fund abandoned its focus on investing
‘primarily in debt securities’ of companies experiencing
business or financial difficulties” starting in 2008 and
“purchased and traded CDS that were based on largely foreign
sovereign debt,” according to the complaint.  A credit-default swap is a contract that requires one party
to pay another for the face value of a bond if the issuer
defaults.  Boudreau said he is seeking to recover more than
$200 million on behalf of himself and other investors.  Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for Zurich-based  UBS AG (UBSN) ,
didn’t immediately return an e-mail request for comment on the
lawsuit. A person who declined to provide her name at Englewood
Cliffs, New Jersey-based Bond Street Capital declined to comment
on the lawsuit.  The case is Boudreau v. UBS Willow Management, 12-cv-9288,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
