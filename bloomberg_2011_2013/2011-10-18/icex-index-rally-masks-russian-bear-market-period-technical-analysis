Russia’s  Micex index (INDEXCF) , the best
performing benchmark emerging-market measure in the past two
weeks, may reverse course and extend its 16 percent decline in
2011, according to indicators used in  technical analysis .  The 30-stock Micex’s 13 percent advance since Oct. 5
doesn’t mark the beginning of a rebound,  Richard Ross , a
chartered market technician at Auerbach Grayson & Co. in New
York, said by phone on Oct. 18. The index, which had its biggest
one-day advance since May 2010 on Oct. 6, is in the middle of a
“counter-trend rally” disguising a “bullish to bearish
reversal” that began in early March and accelerated from June
to August, according to Ross.  “There’s a lot of pent-up pessimism that’s now being
converted into short-term optimism and hope,” Ross said in an
interview. “Ultimately, these gains will prove ephemeral, and
the Micex will move lower as that structural trend asserts its
dominance.”  The Micex has been trading below its 50-week moving average
of 1,639.05 since the beginning of August, the first time it has
been below the level for more than a week since May 2009. This
is a signal that the Micex is shifting from a  bull market , that
began in late 2008, to a  bear market , Ross said. A bear market
is reached when an index declines 20 percent or more from a
peak, while a bull market is attained when an index rises more
than 20 percent from a trough.  Relative Strength  The index added 121 percent in 2009 and 23 percent last
year, and is poised to rise 4.3 percent in October, the first
monthly advance since July, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Micex increased 1.6 percent to 1,425.24 in Moscow
yesterday, the highest level this week.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security
or index.  The Micex’s relative strength index, or RSI, also points to
further declines, Ross said. The Micex’s weekly RSI reached
31.1277 in the week ended Aug. 21, the lowest level since
January 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The RSI’s August decline marked the bourse’s “first
confirmed sell signal,” Ross said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
