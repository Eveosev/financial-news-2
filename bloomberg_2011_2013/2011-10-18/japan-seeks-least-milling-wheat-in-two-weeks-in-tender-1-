Japan  is seeking to buy 102,652
metric tons of milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia 
in a regular tender on Oct. 20, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.  Shipment is set from Dec. 1 to Dec. 31, Toshiki Tojo at the
ministry’s grain-trade division said today by phone. The volume
sought is the smallest since Oct. 6, when the government bought
79,701 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 2.73 million tons
through regular tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16
million tons in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
