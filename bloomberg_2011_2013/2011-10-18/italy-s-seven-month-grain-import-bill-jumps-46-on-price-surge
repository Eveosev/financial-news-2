Italy , the world’s second-largest
wheat buyer, paid 46 percent more to import grains in the year’s
first seven months on surging prices, according to the national
cereal-industry association.  The cost of inbound shipments jumped to 2.03 billion euros
($2.8 billion) from 1.39 billion euros a year earlier, the Rome-
based Associazione Nazionale Cerealisti, known as Anacer, said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Year-on-year inflation in Italy, the third-biggest euro-
region economy, was 2.1 percent in July, down from 3 percent in
June. Wheat prices in  Chicago  at the end of June were up 28
percent from a year earlier, lifting costs for importers, even
after plunging 21 percent for the month.  Grain imports into Italy increased 5.1 percent to 7.11
million metric tons by volume in the January-July period from
6.76 million tons a year earlier, Anacer said.  Italians include more wheat products such as bread and
pasta in their diet than consumers in  France ,  Germany , the U.S.
and the U.K.,  data  from the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center show.  Wheat imports into Italy came to 7.35 million tons in the
marketing year that ran through June, based on Anacer figures.
That makes the country the world’s second-biggest buyer of the
grain behind  Egypt , International Grains Council figures show.  Italy’s wheat imports rose to an eight-year high in 2010 as
domestic production fell.  Durum Wheat  Soft-wheat imports in 2011’s first seven months were little
changed by volume at 2.6 million tons from the year-earlier 2.62
million tons, even as the cost surged 70 percent to 676 million
euros, Anacer said. Imports of durum wheat, the hard variety
used in pasta, fell to 1.11 million tons from 1.24 million tons
as the cost rose 19 percent to 269.3 million euros.  Seven-month corn imports rose 37 percent to 1.7 million
tons by volume, and the cost more than doubled to 369.5 million
euros, Anacer said.  Including oilseed and protein-crop products, the value of
Italy’s imports increased to 2.95 billion euros in the period
from 2.26 billion euros.  Italian cereal-industry exports were worth 1.7 billion
euros from January to July, compared with 1.49 billion euros a
year earlier, Anacer reported. That resulted in a trade deficit
of 1.25 billion euros, more than the previous year’s shortfall
of 768.3 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
