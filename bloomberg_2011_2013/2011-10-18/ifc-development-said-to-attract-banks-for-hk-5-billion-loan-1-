IFC Development Ltd. is close to
securing loan commitments of a total of HK$5 billion ($643
million) from five banks, said a person familiar with the matter.  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ,  Mizuho Corporate Bank ,
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and
United Overseas Bank Ltd. will likely loan at least HK$1 billion
each, said the person, who declined to be identified because the
details are private. The borrower may increase the facility, the
person said.  IFC Development, owned by  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) ,
Henderson Land Development Co. and Hong Kong & China Gas Co.,
reduced the size of the loan from the HK$17 billion it was
considering earlier this year because of tightening liquidity,
the person said. The new borrowing is to partly refinance a
previous facility of about HK$17 billion.  The new loan pays an all-in, which includes margin and fees,
of about 150 basis points, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
