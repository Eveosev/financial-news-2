Asia  fuel-oil  swaps dropped the most
in more than two weeks. Gasoil’s crack spread widened, signaling
increased profit for refiners making the distillate fuel.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil swaps for November fell $16.50, or 2.5
percent, to $652 a metric ton at 12:40 p.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s the
biggest drop since Oct. 3.  Fuel oil’s discount to Asian marker Dubai crude narrowed 17
cents to $5.04 a barrel, PVM data showed. The gap shrank for a
second day, indicating reduced losses for refiners turning oil
into residual products. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil
to 380-centistoke grade was unchanged after climbing to $7.75. A
wider viscosity spread means bunker, or marine fuel, declined
more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude rose $1.31
to $16.65 a barrel, according to PVM. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, widened the most since Sept. 16.  November gasoil swaps decreased $1.40, or 1.1 percent, to
$122 a barrel, falling the most in two weeks, PVM said. Jet
fuel’s premium to gasoil added 10 cents to $3.10, the highest
since Feb. 23. A widening regrade signals it is profitable to
make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
$1.43 to $102.12 a ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This crack spread slid from the widest in almost two weeks.  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
second-half November delivery were bid at $912.50 a ton against
offers at $915.50, based on data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore
Pte, a broker. The petrochemical feedstock closed yesterday at
$933.50, the highest since Sept. 21.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday gained 40 cents to
$24.50 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. A wider reforming margin
indicates it is profitable to produce motor fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
