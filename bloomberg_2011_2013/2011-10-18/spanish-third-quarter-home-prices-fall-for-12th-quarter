Spanish home prices fell for the
12th quarter as uncertainty about the economy and an increase in
bad loans discouraged lenders from granting mortgages.  The average price of houses and apartments declined 5.5
percent in the three months through September from a year
earlier, the Ministry of Public Works said today on its website.
Prices dropped 1.3 percent from the previous quarter, the 14th
quarterly decline.  Mortgage lending in  Spain , which has the highest
 unemployment rate  in the Europe Union, fell by 47 percent in
July, the most on record, as banks reined in lending amid a
surge in bad loans and higher borrowing costs, the National
Statistics Institute said on Sept. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
