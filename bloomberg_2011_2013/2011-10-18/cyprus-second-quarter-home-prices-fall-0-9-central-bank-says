Home prices  in Cyprus fell in the
second quarter for a sixth consecutive quarter amid declining
construction activity, the east Mediterranean island’s central
bank said.  Home prices fell 0.9 percent in the second quarter from the
previous three months and 4.9 percent annually, Nicosia-based
 Central Bank of Cyprus  said in a  statement  on its website today.  The drop in prices was mainly in the island’s coastal
areas, with Paphos on the west coast registering with 2.3
percent, the largest quarter-on-quarter slump, while housing
prices in capital Nicosia fell marginally, according to the
statement. Island-wide, house and apartment prices fell 1
percent and 0.8 percent respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
