Singapore ’s Straits Times Index
dropped 2 percent to 2,724.69 at the close. All but three stocks
in the index of 30 companies declined.  The following shares were among the most active in the
market. Stock symbols are in parentheses after the company
names.  K-REIT Asia (KREIT)   tumbled 9.7 percent to 93 Singapore
cents after the office landlord announced plans to sell shares
at a discount. The company said it will raise S$984 million
($776 million) selling shares to existing shareholders at 85
Singapore cents each to partially finance the acquisition of
Ocean Properties Pte, owner of an office building in Singapore’s
Raffles Place central business district, for S$1.57 billion from
parent  Keppel Land Ltd. (KPLD)  .  Midas Holdings Ltd. (MIDAS)  , a supplier of aluminum
alloy profiles used in train carriages in  China , slumped 8.2
percent to 39 Singapore cents. Construction work on more than
10,000 kilometers of new train lines has been suspended
nationwide because of cash shortages, the China Business News
reported, citing Wang Mengshu, an engineer at China Railway
Group Ltd., the nation’s biggest builder of rail infrastructure.  Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. (NOL SP), Southeast  Asia ’s
biggest container carrier, fell 3.9 percent to S$1.125. The
company said average freight rates declined 19 percent in the
four weeks to Sept. 23 from a year earlier even as it carried
5.4 percent more cargo over the period.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  , the world’s second-
biggest carrier by market value, dropped 2 percent to S$11.06.
The company said it filled 79.6 percent of its seats in
September, down from 80.3 percent a year earlier, as growth in
passenger traffic failed to keep up with a rise in capacity.  Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) Ltd. (YZJ SP), China’s
third-largest shipyard outside state control, declined 5.7
percent to 91 Singapore cents. DMG & Partners Securities Pte cut
its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “buy,” saying
earnings will likely peak this year and drop over the next two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
