European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said he sees “risks” to
 Portugal  meeting its 2011 deficit target.  “Perhaps inevitably, the measures taken to reduce the
fiscal gap have been mainly on the revenue side,” Rehn said
today in the text of a speech. “In spite of these efforts, the
latest information suggests that there are risks to attaining
the 2011 deficit target as specified in the program. This is
unfortunate, and underscores failures in budget planning and
execution, which need to be fixed.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
