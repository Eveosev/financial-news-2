France and  Germany  have yet to agree
on how to bolster the European bailout fund as they seek to
overcome technical hurdles and to complete a plan to stem the
debt crisis, said a person with direct knowledge of the talks.  The U.K.â€™s Guardian newspaper reported that the countries
have reached agreement on a plan to leverage the fund.  The two countries are working on how to increase the
effective power of the  European Financial Stability Facility 
rescue fund, said the person, who declined to be named because
the talks are not public. Such a measure needs to be part of a
comprehensive agreement to help banks and  Greece , the person
said.  European leaders have until an Oct. 23 summit to settle
differences and flesh out their strategy, they were told by
Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers last week in
Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
