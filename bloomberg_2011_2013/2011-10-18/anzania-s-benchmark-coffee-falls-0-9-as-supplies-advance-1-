Tanzania’s benchmark coffee grade
declined 0.9 percent at an auction on Oct. 13 after supplies of
the grade increased, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The average price for the top arabica AA grade fell to
$284.86 per 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from $287.36 a week
earlier as supplies climbed 4.2 percent, the board said in an e-
mailed statement today. Prices for other grades also gained as
bean-quality improved and as global prices rose, the board said.  Total supplies at the seventh auction of the 2011-12 season
rose 40 percent to 23,310 bags while sales advanced by the same
percentage, it said.  Tanzania reaps its coffee harvest from April through August
with arabica accounting for 75 percent of the country’s output
and robusta the rest.  The following are details of the Oct. 13 auction in U.S.
