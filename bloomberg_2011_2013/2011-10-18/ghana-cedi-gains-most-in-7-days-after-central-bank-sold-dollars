Ghana ’s cedi strengthened to the
highest in seven trading sessions against the dollar as demand
for the U.S. currency by companies eased following the central
bank’s sale of dollars yesterday.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
appreciated as much as 0.3 percent to 1.6259 per dollar, the
highest since Oct. 7, before trading less than 0.1 percent
stronger at 1.6294 as of 2:26 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Dollar buying has generally cooled off,” Kofi Pianim, a
currency trader at the local unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd.
said in a telephone interview today. “The central bank too has
been more frequent with selling dollars, easing pressure on the
cedi.”  The Accra-based  Bank of Ghana  sold $98 million yesterday,
said Adams Nyinaku, head of treasury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
