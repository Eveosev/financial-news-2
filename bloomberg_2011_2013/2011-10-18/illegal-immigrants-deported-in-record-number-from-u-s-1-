The U.S. removed 396,906 illegal
immigrants in the last fiscal year, a record number, the Obama
administration said.  Deportations in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 were up
4,044 from the year before. An increasing number of those
removed have criminal records, according to U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement.  The Obama administration has stepped up arrests and
deportations of those convicted of crimes. The strategy is a
departure from immigration policies of President Barack Obama’s
predecessor,  George W. Bush , who emphasized raids on businesses
suspected of hiring illegal immigrants.  “We are making progress, with more convicted criminals,
recent border crossers, egregious immigration law violators and
immigration fugitives being removed from the country than ever
before,” said  John Morton , director of the immigration and
customs agency, in a statement today.  Of those deported, 216,698, or 55 percent, had been
previously convicted of felonies and misdemeanors, according to
the statement. That’s an 89 percent increase in the deportation
of criminals since fiscal year 2008, the agency said.  In fiscal 2010, more than 195,000 of those deported were
convicted criminals.  Last year’s removals included 1,119 illegal immigrants
convicted of homicide; 5,848 of convicted of sexual offenses;
44,653 convicted of drug-related crimes; and 35,927 convicted of
driving under the influence.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
