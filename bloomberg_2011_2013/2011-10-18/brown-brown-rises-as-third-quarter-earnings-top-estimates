Brown & Brown Inc. (BRO) , the family run
insurance broker, rose the most in almost three years in New
York trading as earnings beat estimates.  Shares of the  Daytona Beach , Florida-based firm rose 9.7
percent to $19.67 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
It was the largest increase since Oct. 28, 2008.  Operating earnings were 31 cents a share, the company said
today in a statement, beating the 30-cent average estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue was $260 million
compared with $248 million a year earlier.  “Interest level is good and the pipeline is good. We’re
seeing lots of opportunities that seem to be coming into the
market today,” President and Chief Executive Officer J. Powell Brown said in a conference call. “The economy continues to
present challenges in growing our business.”  Net income decreased to $44.2 million, or 30 cents a share,
from $44.3 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier, according to
the statement. The firm reported a one-time legal expense of
$2.6 million in claims, or 1 cent per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
