German bonds rose, pushing the 10-
year yield down from near a six-week high, before a report
economists said will show investor confidence in  Europe ’s
largest economy fell amid the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  Two-year yields declined for a second day as a report
showed  China’s economy  grew the slowest pace since 2009, fueling
speculation the global economic recovery is spluttering. The ZEW
Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim will say its
index of investor and analyst expectations declined to minus 45
from minus 43.3 in September, according to the median of 39
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  German 10-year yields dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.08 percent at 7:03 a.m. London time. They
rose yesterday to 2.25 percent, the highest since Sept. 1. The
2.25 percent security due September 2021 gained 0.165, or 1.65
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,377) face amount, to 101.505. Two-year
rates also slipped two basis points, to 0.56 percent.  The Chinese economy grew 9.1 percent in the third quarter
from a year earlier, less than the median estimate of 9.3
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 22 economists before the
statistics bureau released the data in Beijing today. Expansion
slowed from 9.5 percent in the previous three months.  Bunds rose yesterday after  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s chief
spokesman Steffen Seibert said a quick end to the crisis that
investors are hoping for at a Group of 20 summit on Oct. 23 was
unlikely.  German bonds have handed investors 5.97 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. That compares with a
return of 8.09 percent for U.S. Treasuries. Greek bonds tumbled
41 percent while Italian securities lost 3.55 percent, even as
the  European Central Bank  bought the nation’s securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
