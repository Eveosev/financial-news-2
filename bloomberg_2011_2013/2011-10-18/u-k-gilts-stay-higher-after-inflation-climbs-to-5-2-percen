U.K. government bonds stayed higher
after a report showed U.K. consumer prices climbed a the highest
in almost 20 years in September.  The 10-year yield was five basis points lower at 2.48
percent at 9:35 a.m. in  London .  Consumer prices rose 5.2 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 4.5 percent in August, the Office for National
Statistics said in London today. The median of 35 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey was 4.9 percent. Bank of England Governor
Mervyn King said earlier this month that consumer-price growth
will probably peak in September and slow “sharply” in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
