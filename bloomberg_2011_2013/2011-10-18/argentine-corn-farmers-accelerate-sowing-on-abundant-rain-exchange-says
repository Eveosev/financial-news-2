Corn farmers in  Argentina , the
world’s second-biggest exporter, accelerated planting in the
main growing region after “abundant” rain over the past few
weeks, according to the Rosario Cereals Exchange.  “Very good” soil moisture in the main growing area
allowed farmers to speed up sowing after some regions received
as much as 100 millimeters (3.9 inches) of rain, said Tomas
Parenti, an agricultural engineer at the exchange, in a
telephone interview today.  Producers in the main region are likely to plant corn
across 14 percent more land this season, up from a year ago,
Parenti said. The crop in the main area is about 80 percent
planted and will cover about 870,000 hectares (2.1 million
acres), he said. Corn planting was delayed because of last
month’s dry weather.  Corn futures for December delivery increased 0.5 percent to
$6.435 a bushel at 10:22 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
U.S. is the world’s biggest corn producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
