Kuwait Petroleum Corp. will decide
on the international investors in a joint venture refinery with
 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  in  China  “soon”, the Kuwait
Times reported, citing the company’s chief executive officer.  “We at KPC still plan to give around 20 percent of our
share to potential international investors, but a final decision
will be made after studies are completed on pivotal issues, such
as the number of petrol stations we can obtain,” the newspaper
cited Farouk Al-Zanki as saying in a report on its  website 
yesterday. Construction of the facility in Guangdong province’s
Zhanjiang city has begun with operations expected to start at
the end of 2014, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
