Scottish  house prices  rose to a
three-month high in August, outperforming values in England and
Wales during the month and over the previous year, according to
a report.  The average price of a home in  Scotland  rose 0.4 percent
from July to 148,075 pounds ($232,000), while values were down
1.7 percent from a year earlier,  Acadametrics Ltd.  and  LSL
Property Services Plc  said in an e-mailed report today. England
and Wales prices increased 0.3 percent to 219,078 pounds in
August, 2.2 percent lower than a year earlier.  “In August lenders were beginning to offer more
competitive products,” Acadametrics Chairman Peter Williams
said in the report. “However, there is currently a fear,
brought about by the latest euro zone crisis, that lenders may
need to retrench on some of these products.”  Falling consumer confidence and the biggest squeeze on
Britons’ spending power since the 1970s are undermining housing
demand. Still, prices are being supported by a lack of property
supply and record low borrowing costs. The  Bank of England  has
kept its key  interest rate  at 0.5 percent since March 2009.  Scottish house prices have doubled since 2000, peaking in
April 2008, according to the report. The Scottish index will
likely fall back in September and this month as monthly prices
fail to rise at the same rate as last year, Williams said.  Acadametrics and LSL combine initial transaction data from
 Registers of Scotland  and then adjust the results by type of
property and season for their index of values.  To contact the reporter on this story:
