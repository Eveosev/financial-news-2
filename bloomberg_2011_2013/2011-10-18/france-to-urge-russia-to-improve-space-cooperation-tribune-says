France will urge Russia to
strengthen aerospace cooperation when Education and Research
Minister Laurent Wauquiez meets Russian officials for the first
flight of the Soyuz from Kourou,  French Guiana ,  La Tribune  said
today, citing an interview with Wauquiez.  France doesn’t plan to merge Astrium SAS and  Thales SA (HO) ’s
Alenia Space, which control a combined 40 percent of the
commercial satellite market, the newspaper said.  France plans to focus on satellite-launch maker Arianespace
and cost-cutting in the Ariane 5 program, which needs to trim 10
percent to 15 percent in spending in addition to 10 percent in
savings realized on ground systems, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
