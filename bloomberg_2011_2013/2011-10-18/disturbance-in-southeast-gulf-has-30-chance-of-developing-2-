An area of showers and thunderstorms
in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico has a 30 percent chance of
becoming a tropical depression or tropical storm in the next 48
hours, according to the National Hurricane Center.  The disturbance is well-removed from a low-pressure area
near the north coast of the Yucatan peninsula, the Miami-based
hurricane center said in a  weather outlook  before 8 p.m. East
Coast time. It may develop tomorrow before conditions become
less conducive to cyclones forming, according to the outlook.  The center lowered the areaâ€™s chance of forming to 30
percent, down from 60 percent, earlier today. The disturbance is
moving north and is forecast to drop heavy rain over southern
 Florida  and western Cuba, the center said.  Almost 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain fell on  Key West 
over the weekend, while Miami received 3.4 inches, saidJeff Masters, co-founder of Weather Underground in  Ann Arbor ,
Michigan. He said the system will turn northeast into the west
coast of Florida late tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
