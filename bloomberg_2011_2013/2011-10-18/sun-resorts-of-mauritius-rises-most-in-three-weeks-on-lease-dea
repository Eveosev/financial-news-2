Mauritius’s Sun Resorts Ltd., the
country’s second-largest leisure operator by market value,
advanced the most in three weeks after saying it will lease the
Ambre Resort for five years.  The stock gained 1.5 rupee, or 2.9 percent, to 53 rupees,
the biggest intraday rise since Sept. 27, at 11:54 a.m. in  Port
Louis , the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Ebene-based hotel group will lease Ambre Resort & Spa,
a resort on the eastern coast of the Indian Ocean island nation,
for five years, with option to renew for a further 15 years, it
said today in a  statement  to the Stock Exchange of Mauritius.  “This transaction will create value for the shareholders”
of Sun and “will allow the company to capture new market
segments,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
