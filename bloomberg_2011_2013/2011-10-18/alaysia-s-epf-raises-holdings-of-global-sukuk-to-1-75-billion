Malaysia’s state-owned Employees
Provident Fund increased holdings of global Islamic bonds to
$1.75 billion this year from $650 million in October 2010, when
it set up a program to invest in the debt, according to the head
of treasury.  “We are also looking to increase our mandate to include
the Islamic space in the region,” Wan Kamaruzaman Wan Ahmad,
who is also general manager at the fund, said at an Islamic
conference in Kuala Lumpur today, without elaborating.  EPF’s investment in Malaysian government and corporate
bonds is expected to reach 88 billion ringgit ($28 billion) to
90 billion ringgit this year, he said. Holdings totaled 27
billion ringgit in 2006, Wan Kamaruzaman said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
