Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  fell 2.9 percent to 3,622.03,
the sharpest drop since Oct. 3.  Mining companies: PT International Nickel  Indonesia  (INCO
IJ), the nation’s biggest producer of the metal, sank 7.2
percent to 3,225 rupiah, the steepest loss since Oct. 3. PT
Adaro Energy (ADRO IJ), Indonesia’s second-largest coal miner,
fell 4.1 percent to 1,880 rupiah.  Mining stocks fell after  China’s economy  expanded at the
slowest pace in two years, reducing the demand outlook for
commodities, said Armand Dharmasana, head of research at PT
Phillip Securities Indonesia. Shares also fell as metal prices
declined, Dharmasana said. Nickel lost as much as 2.3 percent to
$18,549 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, while tin
declined as much as 3.7 percent to $20,700 a ton.  Palm oil producers: PT Bakrie Sumatera Plantations (UNSP
IJ) slumped 7.9 percent to 290 rupiah and PT Perusahaan
Perkebunan London Sumatra Indonesia (LSIP IJ) declined 4.8
percent to 2,000 rupiah. Palm oil futures dropped as much as 1.9
percent to 2,817 ringgit ($898) a ton in  Kuala Lumpur , falling
for a second day.  PT Matahari Putra Prima (MPPA IJ), Indonesia’s biggest
retailer by market value, slid 2.2 percent to 900 rupiah, the
first loss since Oct. 7.  South Korea ’s Lotte Shopping Co., which
expressed interest in Matahari in February, said it’s no longer
looking to buy an Indonesian retail chain. Matahari said in
January it will seek a “global partner” to help develop its
Hypermart.  To contact the reporter on this story:
