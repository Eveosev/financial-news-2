Viacom Inc. (VIA/B)  told an appeals court
that  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube willfully violated copyrights by
letting users post videos of television shows without
authorization.  Both sides made oral arguments today before the U.S. Court
of Appeals in Manhattan. YouTube told the court it removed
infringing videos from the site when it was notified by
copyright owners.  Viacom sued  YouTube  in 2007, claiming the site’s users were
illegally uploading thousands of videos of Viacom programs such
as “ South Park ” and “The  Daily Show  With  Jon Stewart ,” as
well as movies from its Paramount Pictures studio. The New York-
based entertainment company sought $1 billion in damages.  In the appeal, Viacom seeks to overturn a decision in
Google’s favor last year by a judge without a trial.  Viacom raised questions of fact “a jury might find
relevant” in its court papers, Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes told
a lawyer for  Mountain View , California-based Google. The three-
judge panel said it will announce a decision later.  U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton ruled last year that
YouTube was protected from liability by the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act because it removed the offending videos when told
they had been posted.  “There’s no evidence of a single clip YouTube knew was
infringing that it failed to take down,” Andrew Schapiro, a
lawyer for YouTube, told the panel today.  Viacom Statement  Viacom said YouTube was aware of the copyright violations
when it displayed the videos without authorization.  The lower-court ruling, if not reversed, “will lead to
massive exploitation of copyrighted material on the Internet,”
 Paul Smith , a lawyer for Viacom, said today. “They made
substantial amounts of money on someone else’s property.”  The Football Association Premier League Ltd., a British
soccer organization, and some music publishers also appealed the
lower-court ruling.  Charles Sims, a lawyer for the league, told the court
YouTube benefited financially from the unauthorized videos by
accompanying them with advertisements for travel to worldwide
sports events.  More than 125 briefs supporting either Google or Viacom
were filed by parties such as the  Associated Press , the
Songwriters Guild of America, singers Garth Brooks and Sting,
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the  Consumer Electronics Association , EBay
Inc., Facebook Inc. and Yahoo! Inc.  Google Acquisition  Google, operator of the world’s biggest Internet search
engine, bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. It said in its
brief that Viacom was also interested in buying the site. After
negotiations over a content partnership broke down and Google
made its successful offer, Viacom sent the “takedown” notices
required by law when a content provider wants infringing
material removed from a site.  Viacom said YouTube offered it a partnership agreement
valued at $590 million before talks ended. Viacom also alleged
that YouTube refused to deploy filtering technology to identify
infringing videos unless Viacom agreed to be a financial
partner.  YouTube was founded in 2005 by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and
Jawed Karim, who all previously worked at the Internet payment
provider PayPal. YouTube at first displayed mostly homemade
videos uploaded for free and viewed by other visitors to the
site. YouTube is now an aggregator of audio and video from major
entertainment, media and sports companies.  Judges on Panel  Besides Cabranes, the appeals judges were Roger Miner and
Debra Ann Livingston.  Google rose $5.14, or 0.88 percent, to $587.55 at 2:20 p.m.
 New York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Viacom’s B shares
climbed 55 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $42.70 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  The cases are Viacom International v. YouTube, 10-03270,
and the Football Association v. YouTube, 10-03342,  U.S. Court of
Appeals  for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
