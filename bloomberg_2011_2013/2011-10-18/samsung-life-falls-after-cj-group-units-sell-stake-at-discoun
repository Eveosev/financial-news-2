Samsung Life Insurance Co. retreated
as much as 6.6 percent in Seoul trading after CJ Group units
sold 4 million shares in the life insurer at a discount. Samsung
Life fell to 84,500 won as of 9:20 a.m. on the Korea Exchange.
The benchmark Kospi Index slipped 1.8 percent. CJ Group in June
said it will use its Samsung Life stake and other non-core
assets to fund a takeover of Korea Express Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
