Brazil  created more jobs than
economists expected in September, led by the services and civil
construction sectors.  Brazil generated 209,078 registered jobs last month, up
from 190,446 in August. The number was higher than the median
forecast of 168,625 jobs from 10 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The job creation figure was the lowest for the month
of September in five years.  Economists expect policy makers to cut borrowing costs by a
half point to 11.5 percent at their meeting this week, according
to a central bank survey published yesterday. Bank President
Alexandre Tombini said Oct. 6 that “moderate” rate cuts could
protect Brazil from global turbulence while slowing inflation to
target by year-end 2012. The jobs number will have little effect
on the bank’s decision, said  Andre Perfeito , chief economist at
Sao Paulo-based Gradual Investimentos.  “The figure shows a certain advance, but we have to
remember that this is the worst September jobs number since
2006,” Perfeito said in an interview by e-mail.  Futures Fall  The yield on the interest-rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 10.49 percent at 11:17 a.m.
New York time. The real strengthened 0.7 percent to 1.7621 per
dollar.  Latin America ’s biggest economy will grow 3.42 percent this
year, according to the central bank’s survey published
yesterday, down from a forecast of 3.50 percent the previous
week. Analysts also cut their 2012 growth forecast to 3.6
percent from 3.7 percent.  Tombini surprised analysts Aug. 31 by slashing the
benchmark Selic rate 50 basis points to 12 percent, citing a
“substantial deterioration” in the global outlook. Analysts
expect policy makers to cut the Selic to 11 percent by year-end
and to 10.5 percent by the end of 2012, according to the bank’s
weekly survey of economists.  Consumer prices rose 7.31 percent in the year through
September, exceeding the 6.5 percent upper limit of the central
bank’s target range for a sixth straight month. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Retail sales in August fell the most since March 2010.
Industrial output contracted in August for the third time in
five months, while business confidence in the third quarter fell
to its lowest level in more than two years.  Brazil’s labor market has remained heated in the face of
the economy’s slowing pace. Unemployment in August was 6
percent, a record low for the month.  The services industry led  job creation  in September, with
91,774 positions generated. Civil construction saw the greatest
percentage increase, 0.91 percent, with 24,977 jobs.  The government-registered job creation number is a balance
of posts created minus jobs eliminated. Registered jobs, so-
called formal work, assure employees a range of benefits such as
 unemployment insurance , bonuses and retirement payments by the
government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
