Following is a table detailing U.S.
crop acreage for corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton, according to
the  Farm Service Agency , a division of the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture .  Producers participating in the direct and counter cyclical-
payment program, the Average Crop Revenue Election (CARE) Program
and those receiving U.S. government marketing assistance loans or
loan deficiency payments are required to file. The reports are
used to determine payment eligibility and to calculate losses for
disaster programs. The National Agricultural Statistics Service
division of the USDA also uses this data to complement their
acreage survey data.
