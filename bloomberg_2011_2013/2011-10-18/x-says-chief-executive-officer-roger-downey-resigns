MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the
iron-ore producer controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike
Batista , said Chief Executive Officer Roger Downey resigned as
the company seeks $1.8 billion in project financing.  Chief Financial Officer Guilherme Escalhao was named as the
new CEO, Rio de Janeiro-based MMX said today in a statement,
adding that Downey’s resignation was for “personal reasons.”
Guido Germani was named to replace Escalhao, the company said.  The reason for his resignation is “exclusively personal,”
Downey said on a conference call. He said he wants to “live
life a little bit slower, closer to my family.” He plans to
remain a shareholder in the company.  MMX will have $1.8 billion in loans for its Serra Azul
project completed before year-end, Downey said in an interview
Aug. 11. Downey, 44, a former mining equity analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG, has been MMX’s CEO since August 2009.  MMX rose 3.5 percent to 7.10 reais today in  Sao Paulo . The
stock has dropped 37 percent this year, almost double the 20
percent fall of  Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-ore producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
