Belarus’s central bank, which
charges a world-leading 35 percent interest rate on the money it
prints, is seeking to raise $16,000 selling office supplies and
household items from coffee cups and suitcases to a used
television and stereo.  The Natsionalnyi Bank Respubliki Belarus is offering more
than 500 items ranging in price from 480 rubles (8 cents at the
official  exchange rate ) for a cardboard box to 37.2 million
rubles for a tapestry featuring the medieval city of Pinsk, the
bank said in a  statement  on the Minsk City Council’s website.  Unused items put up for sale include a pack of 30 paper
bags for 1,295 rubles, a sugar bowl for 4,270 rubles and two
suitcases for 44,928 rubles apiece. Used items include an Aiwa
dictaphone for 591,429 rubles, a Horisont television for 417,958
rubles and 10 safes ranging from 8.8 million rubles to 11.2
million rubles.  “This doesn’t have anything to do with the situation with
the country’s economy or the central bank’s financial
wellbeing,” said Aleksander Timoshenko, a central bank
spokesman, by phone from Minsk today. “The bank is simply
selling things it doesn’t need.”      People interested in buying
the items on offer had between Oct. 11 and Oct. 16 to apply,
said Maksim Matrunchik, the official who organized the sale. He
declined to say how much money was raised.  Belarus raised its benchmark refinancing rate on Oct. 14
for the 10th time this year, to 35 percent, to help stem a loss
of foreign currency reserves. The former Soviet republic needed
$3.5 billion in emergency funding from the  International
Monetary Fund  in 2009 and is seeking another $7 billion from the
IMF now, First Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Amarin said Oct.
3, according to the state-run Belta news service.  President Aleksandr Lukashenko’s government is facing some
“serious problems” with the economy, though there’s little
chance of a default on the country’s sovereign debt, said  Chris Jarvis , the head of the IMF mission in Minsk, yesterday.
Belarus’s key rate is more than double  Vietnam ’s 15 percent, the
second highest in the world.  To contact the reporters on this story:
