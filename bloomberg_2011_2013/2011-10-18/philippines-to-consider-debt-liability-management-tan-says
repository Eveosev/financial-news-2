The  Philippines  will still consider
fundraising and debt management options even after selling about
110 billion pesos worth of bonds targeted to individuals,
Treasurer  Roberto Tan  told reporters today after a debt auction.  The nation plans to stick to the borrowing plan it had set
for the year, Tan said. The governmentâ€™s bond sinking fund
bought about 53 billion pesos of the retail bonds while state-
owned agencies purchased 5.64 billion pesos of the notes,
according to a statement of the Bureau of the Treasury.  Of the total, about 55.12 billion pesos of the notes were
due in 15 years and 54.97 billion pesos debt are maturing in 10
years, based on the Treasury statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
