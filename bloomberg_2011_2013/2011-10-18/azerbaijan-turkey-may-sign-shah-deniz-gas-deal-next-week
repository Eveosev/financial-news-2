Azerbaijan  and  Turkey  may sign an
agreement next week that will allow the delivery of Shah Deniz
gas to Europe, privately owned Azeri news service APA reported
today, citing Rovnaq Abdullayev, president of the State Oil Co.
of Azerbaijan.  The deal may be signed during the planned opening of an  oil
refinery  in the Turkish city of Izmir on Oct. 25, Abdullayev
said, according to APA.  A transit agreement would give a boost to the BP Plc-led
group that plans to export Shah Deniz gas to Europe via Turkey
by 2017. The European Union is looking to the Caspian, including
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, to diversify supply, offset
dwindling production and reduce dependence on  Russia .  Pipeline projects in the bloc’s so-called southern
corridor, including the OMV AG-led Nabucco, are seeking supplies
from Shah Deniz, one of the world’s biggest deposits, as is
Russia’s OAO Gazprom.  The Nabucco project to carry the gas across Turkey to the
EU is vying with smaller pipelines such as the Interconnector
Turkey-Greece-Italy, or ITGI, led by Edison SpA and Depa SA, and
the Statoil ASA and Elektrizitaets-Gesellschaft Laufenburg AG-
led Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG, or TAP.  Abdullayev was cited as saying that the Shah Deniz group
plans to select a pipeline project by the end of November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
