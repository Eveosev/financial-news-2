Republican presidential candidate
 Herman Cain ’s so-called 9-9-9 plan will face renewed scrutiny
after an independent analysis found it would cut taxes for
higher earners while raising them for middle-income Americans.  The  proposal  would reduce the tax bill for almost 95
percent of Americans with cash income exceeding $1 million,
according to the analysis released yesterday by the nonpartisan
Tax Policy Center in  Washington .  Almost 70 percent of taxpayers with cash income between
$200,000 and $500,000 would pay less in taxes, the analysis
said. Meanwhile, about 95 percent of Americans with cash income
between $30,000 and $40,000 would pay more in taxes.  This  analysis  presumes the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts would be
permanently extended.  The 9-9-9 plan “substantially increases the tax burden on
low- and middle-income families and it substantially cuts the
tax burden on the highest-income taxpayers,” said Eric Toder,
the Tax Policy Center’s co-director. “Most taxpayers would
experience an increase under this plan.”  Cain’s plan, which has helped propel his candidacy, would
replace the tax system with 9 percent business and individual
taxes and a 9 percent  sales tax . He has fought back against
charges that his plan would have a disproportionate impact on
lower-income tax brackets.  More and Less  “Some people will pay more but most will pay less,” he
said during an Oct. 16 appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  He said that his plan would reduce the tax burden on many
Americans by eliminating taxes, such as those on payroll, that
are “embedded” in the cost of goods.  Cain’s campaign released a revenue analysis on Oct. 12 that
projected the 9-9-9 plan would collect more than $2 trillion
during a single year. His analysis didn’t discuss the
distributional impact of the proposal.  Representatives for Cain’s campaign didn’t respond to a
requests for comment yesterday on the  Tax Policy Center ’s
findings.  The center’s analysis painted a stark picture of how
different income brackets would fare under the 9-9-9 proposal if
the so-called Bush tax cuts are extended. The 95 percent of
millionaires who would pay lower taxes would receive an average
tax cut of $487,300. Taxes would increase an average of $4,492
on those with cash income between $30,000 and $40,000.  Cain’s fellow Republican presidential candidates haven’t
embraced the proposal. Former Senator  Rick Santorum  of
 Pennsylvania  told  CNN  yesterday that the creation of a sales tax
isn’t a “conservative proposal.”  “That’s giving more tools for Washington to take more
money from the American public,” he said.  Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky
Republican, was also dismissive of the proposal.  “The presidential campaign is one thing,” he told
reporters yesterday. “We’re pursuing our own interests here”
in Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
