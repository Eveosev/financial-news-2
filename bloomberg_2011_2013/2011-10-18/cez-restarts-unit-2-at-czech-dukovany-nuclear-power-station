CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic â€™s largest
utility, will reconnect unit 2 at its Dukovany nuclear power
plant to the grid tomorrow.  The 440-megawatt reactor was restarted today after a
scheduled maintenance and refueling shutdown, Petr Spilka, a
company spokesman, said by telephone. Unit 1 remains halted
while units 3 and 4 are operating at almost full capacity, CEZ
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
