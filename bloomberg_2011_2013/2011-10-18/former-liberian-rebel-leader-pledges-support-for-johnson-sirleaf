Prince Yormie Johnson, a Liberian
former rebel leader and third-place finisher in the Oct. 11
presidential election, pledged his support to incumbent leader
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in next month’s runoff.  The Nobel Peace Prize winner is “the lesser of the two
evils,” Johnson, who is currently a senator, told reporters in
Monrovia, the capital, today. “Some of her policies are good for
this country.”  With 97 percent of ballots counted, Johnson received about
12 percent of the votes. Johnson-Sirleaf, who got 44 percent,
will contest Winston Tubman, who received 32 percent, in the
second round set for Nov. 8, according to the  National Elections
Commission .  To contact the reporter on this story
