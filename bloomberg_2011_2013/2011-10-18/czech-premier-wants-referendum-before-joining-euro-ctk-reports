The Czech Republic should hold a
referendum before it adopts the euro because the monetary union
has changed since the country committed to joining it, the CTK
newswire reported, citing Prime Minister Petr Necas.  Necas reiterated his government wonâ€™t set a target date for
making the currency switch, according to the newswire, which
quoted him in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
