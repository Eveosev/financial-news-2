European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said the EU needs stronger
financial backstops.  “We have to build much stronger financial backstops to
continue the contagion effects,” Rehn said today in the text of
a speech. “The more flexible EFSF agreed in July has now been
ratified by all Member States, and work is proceeding apace to
make the new instruments operational, including the capacity to
buy bonds in secondary markets. Maximizing the effective lending
capacity of the EFSF to expand its firepower is also on the
table, and I am confident that an agreement will be found,” he
said.  “We also support advancing the permanent successor, the
ESM,” Rehn said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
