European Central Bank Governing
Council member Luc Coene said a meeting of European Union
leaders this weekend will be “decisive” to calm investors’
concerns about the European sovereign debt crisis.  EU leaders need to reach agreements about  Greece  and the
payment of a next installment of rescue funds, about the use of
the European Financial Stability Facility’s resources and about
budgetary adjustments and structural reforms that encourage
economic growth, Coene said in Mons,  Belgium  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
