Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the largest exporter of
coal used in power plants, said its coal operations in South
Africa have been “significantly impacted” by a strike.  “There is also participation at Lion Ferrochrome,
Lydenburg ferrochrome plant, Eland platinum mine and the Rhovan
vanadium operation,” Xstrata spokesman Songezo Zibi said today
in an e-mailed statement. “Customer deliveries are not affected
by the strike at this stage.”  As many as 6,400 workers have downed tools and no further
talks with Xstrata have been scheduled,  Lesiba Seshoka , a
spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers, said by
telephone from Johannesburg. The strike started Oct. 16, Xstrata
said yesterday.  NUM, the nation’s largest labor union, wants equal benefits
for all workers under an employee share ownership program, while
the company is seeking different benefits for managers, NUM said
in a statement last week.  Xstrata fell 1.9 percent to 930.8 pence as of 2:01 p.m. in
 London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
