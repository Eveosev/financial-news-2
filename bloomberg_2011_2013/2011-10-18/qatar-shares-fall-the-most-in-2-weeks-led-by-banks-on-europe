Qatar shares fell the most in two
weeks, led by banks, after  Germany  damped expectations of a
quicker resolution to the European debt crisis and  China ’s
economic growth slowed. Crude oil declined.  Commercial Bank of Qatar QSC, up 6.2 percent in the past
two weeks excluding today, dropped. The Persian Gulf country’s
second-biggest lender reported an 8.6 percent increase in
quarterly profit.  Industries Qatar QSC (IQCD) , the Middle East’s
second-biggest petrochemicals company, decreased 1.1 percent.
The  QE Index (DSM)  retreated 0.8 percent, the most since Oct. 4, to
8,400.04, at the 1 p.m. close in Doha. The measure gained 1.9
percent last week.  “Shares are retreating on poor international sentiment and
profit-taking,” said Samer Darwiche, a financial analyst at
Gulfmena Investments in Dubai. “Investors bought on positive
bank expectations and are now selling after strong results.”
Excluding today’s drop of 1 percent, the Qatar Exchange Banking
Sector Index gained 2.2 percent in the past two weeks.  Asian stocks fell, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index losing
as much as 2.7 percent, after a report showed  China’s economy 
grew at the slowest pace since 2009. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index sank 1.9 percent in  New York  yesterday as Germany said
European Union leaders won’t provide a complete fix to the euro-
area debt crisis. The STOXX Europe 600 Index decreased 0.8
percent at 11:52 a.m. in  London .  Bank Earnings  Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQK)  lost 2.7 percent, the most since
Oct. 4, to 79.8 riyals. The bank yesterday said third-quarter
profit jumped to 552.1 million riyals ($152 million), topping
estimates, as fee and commission income increased.  Masraf Al
Rayan (MARK) ,  Al Khaliji (KCBK)  and  Al Ahli Bank (ABQK)  yesterday posted higher nine-
month net income. Masraf shares fell 0.5 percent, Al Khaliji
dropped 2.5 percent, while Al Ahli didn’t trade.  Industries Qatar, which last week posted a 46 percent
increase in quarterly profit, fell to 126.5 riyals.  Crude oil for November delivery declined as much as 1
percent to $85.55 a barrel. Gulf Arab oil exporters, including
 Saudi Arabia  and Qatar, supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index lost 0.1 percent. In
the United Arab Emirates, Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  slipped 0.6
percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  declined 0.3 percent.
Oman’s gauge decreased 0.4 percent, while Bahrain’s BB All Share
Index and Kuwait’s measure were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
