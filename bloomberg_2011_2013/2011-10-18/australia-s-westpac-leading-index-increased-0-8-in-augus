An Australian index of leading
economic indicators gained in August on stronger corporate
profits and rising approvals for new dwellings.  The index, a gauge of future economic growth, rose 0.8
percent from a month earlier to 287,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and
the Melbourne Institute said in a statement in Sydney today.  Westpac’s leading index tracks eight gauges of activity,
including company profits and productivity, to give an
indication of how the economy will perform over the next three
to nine months. The coincident index, a measure of the current
state of the economy, advanced 0.1 percent to 265.9 in August,
Westpac said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
