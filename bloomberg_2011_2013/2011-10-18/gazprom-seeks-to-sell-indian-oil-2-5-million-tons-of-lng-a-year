OAO Gazprom’s marketing and trading
unit in  Singapore  is seeking to supply Indian Oil Corp. with as
much as 2.5 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas a year,
the Russian company said in Gazprom’s corporate magazine.  Gazprom Marketing and Trading Singapore Ltd. signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Indian company, which
envisages LNG supplies for as long as 25 years, according to the
report today in the Blue Fuel corporate magazine.  Gazprom Singapore will provide LNG from current and future
projects of  Russia ’s state gas export monopoly, including
upstream project off the Sakhalin Island and supplements from
its “wider Russian and international supply portfolio,” the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
