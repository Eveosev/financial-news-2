India ’s 10-year bonds advanced a
second day on optimism the nation will raise a limit on overseas
investment in the securities to help absorb increasing
government debt sales.  The finance ministry and the central bank may consider
lifting the $10 billion cap on foreign holdings of sovereign
debt, an official at the ministry said yesterday, asking not to
be identified before a public announcement. The government said
Sept. 29 it will borrow 32 percent more than previously
estimated in the six months through March 2012.  “Any increase in the investment limit will provide short-
term relief to bond investors,” said Rajeev Radhakrishnan, a
Mumbai-based  money manager  at SBI Funds Management Pvt. “The
borrowing program is so huge that local investors alone can’t
absorb all the supplies.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 fell one
basis point to 8.75 percent in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system.  The  finance ministry  said on Sept. 29 it plans to raise 2.2
trillion rupees ($45 billion) by March selling bonds, compared
with an earlier target for 1.67 trillion rupees.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell one basis point to 8.21 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
