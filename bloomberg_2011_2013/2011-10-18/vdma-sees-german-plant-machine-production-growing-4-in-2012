German plant and machinery
production may increase 4 percent next year, driven by demand
from  Asia , the VDMA machine makers’ association said today,
reiterating a forecast from Sept. 8.  “Sales may even exceed the 2008 record of 196 billion
euros ($268 billion),” VDMA President Thomas Lindner said in an
emailed statement today. Plant and machinery production grew
16.7 percent in the first eight months of this year compared
with the same period last year, the statement said.  Lindner said machine makers are concerned that the euro
debt crisis will prompt banks to curb credit to the industry and
called on politicians to “come up with a clear master plan”
that may even include a haircut.  The industry is currently struggling to find enough skilled
workers, Lindner said, adding there are 17,000 unfilled jobs at
present, 8,000 of which are for engineers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
