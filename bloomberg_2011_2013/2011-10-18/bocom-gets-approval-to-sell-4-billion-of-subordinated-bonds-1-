Bank of Communications Co. , China’s
fifth-largest lender by market value, won regulatory approval to
sell as much as 26 billion  yuan  ($4 billion) of subordinated
bonds to bolster its capital.  The sale was approved by the China Banking Regulatory
Commission and the People’s Bank of China, and is part of the
lender’s plan to  raise  as much as 80 billion yuan in China by
the end of this year, the bank said in a filing to the  Hong Kong 
stock exchange yesterday. BoCom started the process, intended to
improve its  capital structure , with a 25 billion yuan sale in
July 2009.  China’s five biggest banks are seeking funding from the
domestic and overseas bond markets to replenish capital as
regulators tighten requirements to curb inflation and reduce the
risk of defaults. Shares of the lenders, which raised $61.5
billion from equities last year, have lost an average 27 percent
this year on concern that a record two-year credit boom may
unravel and lead to rising bad debts.  The sale of fixed-rate bonds will start Oct. 21, comprising
as much as 5 billion yuan of 10-year bonds and as much as 21
billion yuan of 15-year securities, according to a statement
posted on Chinamoney.com.cn, a website of the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System.  BoCom fell 5.1 percent to HK$4.66 in Hong Kong trading as
of 1O:53 a.m., more than the 3.3 percent decline in the city’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index , bringing its drop for the past 12
months to 45 percent.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the world’s
biggest lender by market value, said Sept. 26 its board approved
a plan to sell as much as 70 billion yuan of subordinated debt.
 China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the country’s second-largest
lender, will sell as much as 80 billion yuan of subordinated
notes by the end of August 2013, it said Aug. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
