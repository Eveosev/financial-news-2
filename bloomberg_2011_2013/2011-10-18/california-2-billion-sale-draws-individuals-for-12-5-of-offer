California , the most-indebted state,
took orders from individual investors for 12.5 percent of $2
billion in general-obligation bonds, offering yields of as much
as 4.87 percent for 30-year debt.  Individuals placed orders yesterday for $250 million of the
$1.8 billion in tax-exempt securities in the sale that concludes
tomorrow,  Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for Treasurer Bill Lockyer,
said by e-mail. Preliminary yields ranged as low as 1.15 percent
on three-year securities.  Lockyer said he expected California would have to pay more
than when he offered $2.5 billion in September. Yields on 30-
year top-rated municipal bonds have risen 7 percent since Sept.
26, according to Bloomberg Valuation indexes.  “The market yields are up a little bit and so we will
probably have to pay a little more than would have been true a
month ago,” Lockyer said in an interview yesterday.  Ten-year bonds were priced to yield 3.51 percent, or 34
basis points more than comparable maturities in September. The
30-year bonds were offered at 7 basis points more than in
September. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  In the September sale, the state sold a total of 25 percent
of the bonds to individual investors over two days.  The 10-year bonds in the current sale were offered at 98
basis points above top-rated tax-exempt debt, while the 30-year
bonds were offered at 117 basis points above AAA debt. That’s
down from 109 basis points on 10-year bonds in September and up
from 114 basis points on the 30-year bonds.  The so-called retail sales period is expected to conclude
tomorrow and be followed by orders from institutional investors
on Oct. 19, Dresslar said. In addition to the $1.8 billion in
tax-exempt bonds, California is offering $200 million in taxable
debt.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Wedbush Securities Inc. and J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co. are managing the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
