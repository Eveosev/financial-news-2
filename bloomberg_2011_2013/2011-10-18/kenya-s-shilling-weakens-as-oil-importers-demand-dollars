Kenya ’s shilling, the currency of
 East Africa ’s biggest economy, weakened for the first day in
five as oil importers demanded dollars for their purchases.  The shilling depreciated 0.4 percent to trade at 99.9 per
dollar by 6:27 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil importers are “seeking to buy at this level,” said
Wilson Mutai, a dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp.,
by phone today.  The shilling has depreciated 19 percent this year, making
it the world’s worst performer against the dollar. Inflation
accelerated for the 11th consecutive month in September to 17.3
percent from 16.7 percent a month earlier, more than triple the
government’s target.  Kenya’s central bank will use existing laws, regulations
and other measures to intervene in the  currency market  when
necessary, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said in a statement
in parliament today.
