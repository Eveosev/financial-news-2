The first organized soccer matches
in  Scotland  were played in castle courtyards more than four
centuries ago, according to a new study in Glasgow.  Mary Queen of Scots watched a two-hour game in 1568 at
 Carlisle Castle  after fleeing the Battle of Langside,
researchers at the Scottish Football Museum found.  While historians have traced the sport’s roots to crowds of
people attacking each other to take possession of a ball, they
previously thought it was only civilized and codified in
Victorian times. The  Scottish Football Association  was formed in
1873, a decade after its counterpart in  England .  “Football history written in the past has been in
reference to violent games, damage to property and sometimes
with people getting killed,” Richard McBrearty, the curator at
the  museum  in Glasgow, said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“What we have started to uncover is evidence of references to
small-sided, skilled games. So, it wasn’t invented in the 19th
century. It evolved and went back hundreds of years.”  A letter from Sir Francis Knollys, warden of the English
border with Scotland, describes the game as skilled involving a
retinue of 20 players “with a lack of foul play due to the
smallness of the ball,” said McBrearty, who has been gathering
fragments of information since 1999.  The oldest surviving football in Scotland dates back to
1540 and was found behind paneling in the Queen’s bed chamber in
 Stirling Castle , the researchers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
