Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ,  Austria ’s
biggest lender, should have marked its credit-default swaps to
market prices “years earlier,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts
said as they reduced their rating on the Austrian lender.  Erste posted a 460 million-euro ($630 million) loss last
week after reclassifying CDSs it had previously kept off balance
sheet. The change, which Erste said was triggered by new
guidance from the  International Accounting Standards Board ,
“came as a surprise,” analysts led by Paul Formanko, said in a
report yesterday as they cut their recommendation on the Vienna-
based lender to “neutral” from “overweight.”  The IASB paper Erste blamed “was a restatement of current
rules” rather than a change to existing rules, they wrote.
“Erste should have adopted mark-to-market methodology some
years earlier,” they said.  The size of Erste Bank’s 5.2 billion-euro CDS portfolio
coupled with the associated volatility’’ because the derivatives
will be now marked to market price “may limit investor appetite
in the near term,” the analysts said.  Erste also wrote down the value of its Hungarian and
Romanian subsidiary banks on Oct. 10 and created additional
provisions for rising bad debt in  Hungary . All the measures
together will lead to a loss of as much as 800 million euros
this year, the lender said.  Erste has declined 23 percent in Vienna trading since the
announcement, the third-worst performance in the 46-member
Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index after Dexia
SA and National Bank of Greece SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
