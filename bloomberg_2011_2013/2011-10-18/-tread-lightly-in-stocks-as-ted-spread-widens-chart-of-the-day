Investors ought to “tread lightly
in stocks” because credit markets have yet to show the kind of
optimism that lifted share prices this month, according to Gina Martin Adams, a Wells Fargo & Co. strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY highlights an indicator that Martin
Adams used to draw her conclusion: the TED spread, or the gap
between what financial companies and the U.S. government have to
pay for three-month loans. The chart compares the spread with
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since 2009.  During the first two weeks of October, the differential
widened by four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point. The  S&P
500 , in contrast, recorded its biggest two-week gain since July
2009 by climbing 8.2 percent.  “Credit markets have not confirmed the positive tone of
equities,” Martin Adams, who is based in  New York , wrote in the
report. That’s “usually a warning sign worth noting.”  From the end of July through the end of last week, the TED
spread more than doubled to 39.5 basis points. The gap tends to
widen as concern about credit risk increases, and vice versa.  The spread is among five gauges that Martin Adams is using
to judge whether U.S. stocks are poised to rise. The others are
changes in analyst earnings estimates, copper prices, emerging-
market equities and the  Institute for Supply Management ’s
manufacturing index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
