Xstrata Plc (XTA) , which achieved record
output of power-station coal in the third quarter, agreed on
annual contracts with long-term Japanese customers at prices
that exceeded analysts’ expectations.  Xstrata settled coal prices at $126.50 a metric ton from
Oct. 1, compared with $129.85 on April 1, the Zug, Switzerland-
based company said today in a statement.  “Considering recent bearishness around commodity prices we
consider this an amazing settlement for Xstrata,” Liberum
Capital Ltd. said in a note to investors.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
has dropped 17 percent from this year’s high in April. Copper
for three-month delivery on the  London  Metal Exchange has
slumped 28 percent from a record as economic growth in  China ,
the world’s biggest user of industrial metals, slows.  Mined copper output declined to 223,606 tons in the quarter
from 233,647 tons. Production at the Collahuasi mine in  Chile 
was disrupted by lower ore grades, bad weather and repairs,
Xstrata said. Output of copper cathode, the finished form of the
metal, dropped 4.5 percent to 163,683 tons.  The company reported quarterly thermal-coal output of 20
million tons, the highest ever, compared with 18.5 million tons
a year earlier.  Shares Drop  “The third quarter 2011 marked the end of recent weather-
related production impacts on the coal business,” Rob Clifford,
a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a note.
“On the other side of the ledger, copper production was
hampered by more issues at Collahuasi.”  Xstrata fell 1.3 percent to 936.4 pence at the close of
trading in London.  “With the  stock trading  below our price target, we
maintain our ‘buy’ recommendation,” Clifford said. He has a
share-price target of 1,758 pence for Xstrata.  Production of coking coal, used in steelmaking, increased
by 26 percent. Total output, including semi-soft coal, rose 7.8
percent to 23.6 million tons.  Ferrochrome production dropped 18 percent after scheduled
maintenance at furnaces in  South Africa  was extended, Xstrata
said. Ferrochrome producers settled the third-quarter benchmark
price at $1.20 a pound, 11 percent lower than the second
quarter, because of weaker demand, the company said. The fourth-
quarter price was maintained at $1.20 a pound.  Output Target  Xstrata, seeking to increase overall mining production by
50 percent through 2014 to benefit from growing Asian demand for
coal and metals, approved four projects with a total capital
cost of about $2.2 billion in the quarter.  The company’s five major expansion projects, including
Antamina copper and zinc, Collahuasi copper, Koniambo nickel,
Antapaccay copper and Ravensworth North thermal coal, are on
schedule to start production in 2012, Xstrata said.  Nickel production gained 15 percent to 26,738 tons, while
output of zinc in concentrate, an intermediate product shipped
to smelters, fell 2 percent on lower volumes at  Peru ’s Antamina
mine.  “Base metals and coal operations remain on track to
deliver a stronger second-half performance compared to first
half 2011,” Xstrata said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
