The Southeast may be in for a cold
snap at the end of October, and forecasters differ on how much
that chill will spread to the rest of the eastern U.S.  MDA EarthSat Weather’s  11- to 15-day outlook isolates the
coldest weather in the South while predicting the rest of the
East will have near-normal temperatures and parts of  Maine  may
be warmer than usual.  Matt Rogers , president of  Commodity Weather Group LLC ,
forecasts that most of the East will have cooler-than-normal
weather. Rogers excludes southern Florida and Maine, which he
said will be near normal.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling, and  power plants  use
about 30 percent of the nation’s natural gas supplies, according
to Energy Department data.  Rogers, based in Bethesda,  Maryland , said a pocket of cool
weather may develop in the Midwest, centered on the confluence
of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. MDA, in Gaithersburg,
Maryland, predicts the lower temperatures will be centered on
the Southeast.  Both call for most of the West to be warmer than normal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
