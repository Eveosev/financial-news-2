New York  is becoming a more popular
city for startups, attracting angel investors and entrepreneurs
in what Eric Hippeau, a partner at Lerer Ventures, called an
“incredible” entrepreneurial boom.  “New York is seeing an incredible boom in
entrepreneurship,” Hippeau said today at the Bloomberg
Empowered Entrepreneur conference in New York. Lerer Ventures is
a seed-stage venture capital firm based in New York.  When people want to start businesses, “the money will
follow naturally,” he said. “There was always some angel
community. In New York, it’s much more robust today.”  New York passed Massachusetts in U.S. venture-capital deals
for the first time since at least 1999, as investors seek growth
in consumer Internet startups. The city ranked second in the
latest quarter behind  California , according to an October report
by CB Insights, a venture-capital database.  New York companies took in $831 million in 86 venture-
capital deals in the third quarter, compared with $710 million
for 83 investments in Massachusetts, CB Insights said. A total
of 790 U.S. firms received $7.9 billion, the fourth straight
quarter of growth in venture investments.  Entrepreneurs have to move faster than ever to ensure
others don’t clone their ideas, especially in  Asia  and  Europe ,
Hippeau said.  “How quickly you build your community, how quickly you
build your customer base is how quickly you’re going to put a
moat around your idea,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
