The rand slumped to a two-week low
against the dollar as renewed concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis
and  China ’s economic growth hurt demand for riskier assets and
pushed the currency through levels that triggered automatic sell
orders.  The rand fell as much as 1.7 percent to 8.0957, the weakest
since Oct. 4, and traded 1.1 percent down at 8.0474 as of 5:02
p.m. in Johannesburg.  Moody’s Investors Service said  France ’s top credit rating
is under pressure, after a spokesman for German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  said Europe’s leaders won’t resolve the sovereign-
debt crisis this year. Economic growth in China, the biggest
buyer of South African raw materials, expanded at the slowest
pace since 2009 in the third quarter. Emerging-market stocks
snapped nine days of gains and commodity prices fell.  “Risk aversion reared its ugly head again,” Standard Bank
Group Ltd. analysts led by Johannesburg-based Michael Keenan
said in a research note today. “This morning’s disappointing
GDP data out of China bodes ill for South Africa’s trade
prospects and the rand.”  The rand may decline to 8.21 per dollar after breaching
8.04, a key level, the Standard Bank analysts wrote.  South Africa’s 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 fell for a
second day, pushing the yield up six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 8.14 percent, the highest since Oct. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
