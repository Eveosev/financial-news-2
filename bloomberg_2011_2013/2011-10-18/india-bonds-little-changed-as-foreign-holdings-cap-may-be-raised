India ’s 10-year bonds were little
changed, after rising the most in a week yesterday, on optimism
the nation will raise a limit on overseas investment in the
securities to help absorb increasing government debt sales.  The  finance ministry  and the central bank may consider
lifting the $10 billion cap on foreign holdings of sovereign
debt, an official at the ministry said yesterday, asking not to
be identified before a public announcement. The government said
Sept. 29 it will borrow 32 percent more than previously
estimated in the six months through March 2012.  “Any increase in the investment limit will provide short-
term relief to bond investors,” said Rajeev Radhakrishnan, a
Mumbai-based  money manager  at SBI Funds Management Pvt. “The
borrowing program is so huge local investors alone can’t absorb
all the supplies.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 was
little changed at 8.76 percent as of 9:50 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. It fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, yesterday in the biggest
drop since Oct. 11.  The finance ministry said on Sept. 29 it plans to raise 2.2
trillion rupees ($45 billion) by March selling bonds, compared
with an earlier target for 1.67 trillion rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
