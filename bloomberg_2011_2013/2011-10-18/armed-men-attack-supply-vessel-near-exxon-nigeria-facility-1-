Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Nigerian unit
said armed men attacked a supply vessel near its oil facilities
offshore the southern state of Akwa Ibom yesterday.  “Operation is normal, and production has not been
impacted,” Ozemoya Okordion, a spokesman based in Lagos, the
commercial capital, said today in an e-mailed statement. “The
incident has been reported to security and relevant government
agencies.”  Gunmen on Sept. 30 attacked a vessel supplying one of
Exxon’s offshore oil platforms, wounding one worker and seizing
another. There’s “no update on the incident,” Okordion said.  Violence has risen in the southern Niger River delta, home
to Nigeria’s oil and gas industry, after a period of relative
quiet that followed a government amnesty in 2009 and the
disarming of thousands of fighters.  Nigeria  is  Africa ’s largest
oil producer and fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports.  Armed attacks in the delta cut Nigeria’s oil output more
than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows. Royal Dutch Shell Plc said on Sept. 26 it shut 25,000
barrels a day of crude output from its Imo River field in the
country’s southern Abia state because of the level of theft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
