President  Barack Obama  will sign the
 South Korea , Colombia and Panama free trade agreements on Oct.
21, the White House announced.  The accords were approved by Congress last week. The
agreement with South Korea is the largest trade deal since 1994
and will widen U.S. export access for everything from cars to
farm goods and support about 70,000 jobs, according to the
administration.  Obama also will sign legislation to aid workers who lose
jobs as a result of foreign competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
