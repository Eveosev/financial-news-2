Longfor Properties Co., the
developer controlled by  China ’s richest woman Wu Yajun, said it
priced its  Shanghai  luxury villa project “Affecting Yard” at a
similar level as neighboring developments.   “We usually price our projects above the market,” Shao
Yuqun, a Longfor spokeswoman in Beijing, said via e-mail. “Now
the price is around the market level in the same neighborhood.
This is our strategy.”    Shanghai Securities News reported that Longfor had cut
prices on some projects in Shanghai and other cities. The stock
plunged 12 percent at the midday break in Hong Kong trading, set
for the record slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
