Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-
largest maker of  luxury vehicles , fired Ernst Lieb as head of
Mercedes-Benz’s U.S. operations without explanation, assigning a
temporary replacement to oversee its second-largest market.  “Ernst Lieb has been relieved of his duties as CEO of
Mercedes-Benz USA, effective immediately,” Florian Martens, a
spokesman for the carmaker said today by e-mail, declining to
elaborate. Herbert Werner, the unit’s chief financial officer,
will manage the region “until further notice,” he added.  Lieb, 56, a 36-year Daimler veteran, took charge of sales
and marketing for Mercedes in the U.S. in September 2006.
Mercedes is on track this year to overtake Toyota Motor Corp.’s
Lexus in the country for the first time in more than decade.
Lieb’s departure was unrelated to operational issues, a person
familiar with the situation said.  Nine-month Mercedes deliveries in the U.S. rose 6.5 percent
to 170,058 cars and sport-utility vehicles, while  Lexus ’s year-
to-date sales fell 16 percent to 135,647 autos. The U.S.
accounted for 17 percent of Daimler’s 1.28 million car sales
last year, trailing only  Germany .  “Sales in the past few years showed a positive
development,” said  Juergen Pieper , a Frankfurt-based analyst at
Bankhaus Metzler.  Shares Drop  Daimler fell as much as 1.49 euros, or 4.1 percent, to
35.02 euros and was down 1.5 percent to 35.95 euros as of 11:59
a.m. in Frankfurt trading. The stock has dropped 29 percent this
year, valuing the Stuttgart, Germany-based carmaker at 38.3
billion euros ($52.4 billion).  Under Lieb, Mercedes this year signed a 10-year deal to
rename the New Orleans Superdome after the luxury-car brand and
advertised at the  Super Bowl , the National Football League’s
Championship game, for the first time in 2011. Lieb previously
headed Mercedes units in Canada and  Australia .  Mercedes is preparing to show the CLC four-door coupe next
year in the U.S. The car, aimed at younger, sportier drivers,
will likely be the first in a line of compact front-wheel-drive
vehicles headed to the market, a person familiar with the matter
said on Oct. 14. The brand hopes the vehicle takes market share
away from Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s revamped 3-Series.  BMW, the world’s largest luxury-car maker, is leading the
sales race in the U.S. through September. Deliveries have risen
13 percent to 177,679 vehicles.  Werner was appointed as Mercedes-Benz USA CFO in February
2009, after previously overseeing controlling at powertrain
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
