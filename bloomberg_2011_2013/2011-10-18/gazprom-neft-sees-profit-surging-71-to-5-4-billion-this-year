OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil producer
controlled by Russia’s largest natural-gas company, may pay a
2011 dividend yielding as much as 7 percent after forecasting
record full-year earnings.  Gazprom Neft expects net income to jump 71 percent to $5.4
billion this year following oil-price gains, it said today in a
presentation to analysts. It may boost dividend payments to 23
percent of 2011 net income from 22 percent, First Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Vadim Yakovlev told reporters in Moscow.  “This is very good and probably unexpected by most of the
market,” Alex Fak, a Moscow-based analyst at Troika Dialog,
said today in an e-mail. The income projection would imply a 7
percent dividend yield at current share prices and Gazprom Neft
may be able to afford an even higher level, he said.  Gazprom Neft rose as much as 3.4 percent to 119.50 rubles
in Moscow trading. The stock was at 119.32 rubles as of 5:17
p.m. local time, trimming its decline this year to 7 percent.  The oil producer, controlled by OAO Gazprom, is seeking to
almost double oil and gas output to 100 million metric tons a
year, or 2 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, by 2020 as
it taps remote Siberian deposits and expands abroad. Oil and gas
production will probably rise about 7 percent to 56.5 million
tons this year, led by gas, the presentation shows.  Beat Russian Average  Gazprom Neft’s projected dividend yield would beat the 5.7
percent average for Russian  oil companies , while lagging behind
estimates for OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP)  and OAO Bashneft, Alexander Burgansky, an oil and gas analyst at Otkritie Capital, said by
e-mail today from Moscow.  Gazprom Neft’s Siberian SeverEnergiya venture with  Eni SpA (ENI) ,
 Enel SpA (ENEL)  and OAO Novatek will begin output next year and may
pump as much as 770,000 barrels of oil and gas day by 2020,
according to the presentation. The project will require $9.2
billion in  capital investment  by 2030, and gas will account for
the bulk of output.  Capital spending  may increase to $4 billion next year from
a planned $3.8 billion this year, excluding acquisitions,
Yakovlev said. Gazprom Neft aims to buy the northern Siberian
Novoport oil assets from its parent company Gazprom in the first
quarter of next year, he said.  Gazprom bought control of Gazprom Neft from billionaire
Roman Abramovich for $13.1 billion in 2005. Gazprom owns more
than 95 percent of Gazprom Neft, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
