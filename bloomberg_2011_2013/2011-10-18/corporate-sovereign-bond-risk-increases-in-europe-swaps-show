The cost of insuring against default
on European bank bonds rose on concern politicians are
struggling to agree to a solution to the region’s debt crisis as
the economy slows.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
linked to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers rose four
basis points to 249, the highest in more than a week, while a
gauge of subordinated risk climbed 13 basis points to 483,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at 4 p.m. in  London .  Optimism for a breakthrough is faltering after the German
government said leaders won’t deliver a complete solution to the
crisis at an Oct. 23 summit. Sentiment also waned as reports
showed confidence in the German economy fell to the lowest in
almost three years, U.K. inflation accelerated and Chinese
growth slowed.  “The issues at hand are substantial and the amount of
resources around to fix them are limited,” Anke Richter, a
strategist at Mizuho International in London, wrote in a note.
“Either way you slice or dice the cake, it is unlikely it will
come even close to a big bazooka.”  The cost of innsuring sovereign bonds also increased.
Credit-default swaps on  Belgium  climbed eight basis points to
305, France jumped 10 to 192 and Germany rose four to 97, while
Ireland was up six basis points at 755, CMA prices show. Italy
increased nine basis points to 453, Portugal was two higher at
1,112 and Spain was up four basis points at 384.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments increased 0.5 basis point to 334
basis points. An increase signals worsening perceptions of
 credit quality .  Financial Swaps  Swaps on  Hannover Re  increased nine basis points to 122,
 Commerzbank AG (CBK)  jumped 27 to 232 and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  climbed 15
to 191, according to CMA.  Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN)  rose 13
basis points to 183.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 10
basis points to 750, JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings was
up 3.75 at 178.5 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
