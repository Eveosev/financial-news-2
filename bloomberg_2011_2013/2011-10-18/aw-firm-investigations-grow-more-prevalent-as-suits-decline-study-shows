U.S. and U.K. businesses are going
to court less while being subjected to more regulatory actions
and internal probes, according to a litigation trend  survey  by
Houston-based law firm Fulbright & Jaworski LLP.  Forty percent of respondents reported an increase in
regulatory actions and internal investigations in the 2011
survey, compared with 37 percent of respondents in 2010. The
increase in investigations and regulatory actions is part of a
three-year trend, according to the report. That figure was
34 percent in 2009.  The survey gathered responses from 405 in-house corporate
counsel. Of those, 275 were in the U.S. while 130 were in the
U.K.  Seventy-three percent of U.K. respondents reported lawsuits
filed against them in 2011, compared with 75 percent in 2010.
U.S. respondents saw the figure drop from 87 percent to 83
percent.  Fewer than 31 percent of U.S. respondents said there would
be an increase in litigation within the next year, according to
the survey. Seventeen percent of U.K. respondents expressed that
view. Cases stemming from stricter regulation and company growth
were thought to be the biggest reasons for the increase.  The technology, retail and insurance sectors saw a rise in
suits brought against them, according to the survey. Energy and
manufacturing reported a decrease, and financial services showed
no change.  Fifty-two percent of U.S. corporations reported that they
were likely to become plaintiffs compared with 60 percent in
2010. There was an increase in the U.K. from 36 percent last
year to 42 percent this year.  Labor and employment and contract suits were the most
common types of litigation for corporate counsel respondents,
according to the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
