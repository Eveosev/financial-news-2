German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
the European Union summit on Oct. 23 is “an important step, but
that further steps will still follow” in stemming  Europe ’s debt
crisis.  Debt has built up over decades and the summit will produce
a “clear commitment” to the euro by the region’s leaders,
Merkel told reporters in Berlin today after a meeting with
Uruguayan President Jose Alberto Mujica.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
