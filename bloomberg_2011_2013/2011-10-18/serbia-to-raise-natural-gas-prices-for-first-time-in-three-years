Serbia will raise gas prices on Nov.
1 for the first time in three years, a government spokesman
said.  Srbijagas , the state-owned gas company, will increase gas
prices for industrial users 15 percent, while households will
pay 10 percent more, Milivoje Mihajlovic said yesterday in an
interview after the government decision.  The higher prices were approved a week after consumer-price
inflation slowed to 9.3 percent, the first single-digit reading
since November 2010.  Serbia is heavily reliant on gas imports from Russia and
Srbijagas has been asking for a 30 percent price increase both
for households and industrial consumers to cover the rising
costs of gas imports since 2008.  The unprofitable company, set up in 2005 after the oil
monopoly Naftna Industrija Srbije AD outsourced its gas
business, borrowed 210 million euros ($287 million) in July. It
had 300 million euros in accumulated losses in March this year.  The new  gas prices  are expected to directly add 0.1 percent
to inflation, Ivan Nikolic, an analyst with the Belgrade-based
Economics Institute.  “The impact of the gas price increase may be
underestimated, especially for some parts of the country where
reliance on gas for heating is greater,” Nikolic said.  The overall impact on inflation from a twin increase in gas
and heating prices would be as much as 0.3 percent, Nikolic
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
