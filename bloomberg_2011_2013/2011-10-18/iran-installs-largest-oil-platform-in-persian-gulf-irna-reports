Iran  installed the largest offshore
oil platform in the  Persian Gulf , the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.  The P4 platform was built locally and installed in the
Reshadat oilfield, 110 kilometers (68 miles) southwest of Lavan
Island, according to IRNA.  The installation, previously planned for last month, will
allow Iran to increase its crude-oil production by 75,000
barrels a day, Amir Panahi, managing director of Tasdid, an
Iranian company involved in the project, said Sept. 11.  Iran, the second-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, produced 3.59 million barrels a
day in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
