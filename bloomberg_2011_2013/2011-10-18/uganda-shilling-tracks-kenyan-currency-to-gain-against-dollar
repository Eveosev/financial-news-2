Uganda ’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar, taking its lead from the currency of
neighboring Kenya.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy
appreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 2,868 per dollar, and was
0.3 percent stronger at 2,840 in the capital at 2:01 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It closed at 2,847
yesterday.  Kenya, which is Uganda’s biggest trading partner, imposed
limits on banks’ foreign-currency operations last week as it
sought to bolster its currency. The foreign-exchange exposure
limit for commercial banks was lowered to 10 percent of core
capital from 20 percent, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said on
Oct. 13.  “Companies are staying out of the market on anticipation
that the central bank may follow the Kenya example,” Faisal Bukenya, the head of  currency trading  at Barclays Bank Uganda
Ltd., said by phone from Kampala.  To contact the reporter on this story:
