Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s lawsuit accusing
Samsung Electronics Co. of imitating the iPhone maker’s products
was narrowed by a judge in federal court in  California .  Apple’s claims that Samsung misrepresented its intent to
license certain patents on fair terms was dismissed and
Samsung’s request to throw out some of Apple’s antitrust claims
was granted in a ruling yesterday by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in  San Jose , California. Koh said Apple can amend its
complaint to revive the claims.  Koh didn’t rule on Apple’s request to block Samsung from
selling its Galaxy line of mobile devices in the U.S. based on
claims they violate Apple patents.  Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail yesterday seeking comment on the ruling.  The legal fight between Apple and rival smartphone makers
is intensifying as an increasing number of consumers use smart
phones and wireless handsets to surf the Web, play games and
download music and videos. Samsung and Apple have been involved
in lawsuits since April, when Cupertino, California-based Apple
filed the San Jose lawsuit claiming the Suwon, South Korea-based
company’s Galaxy devices copied the iPhone and iPad.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 11-1846,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporters on this story:
