Hungarian wages rose more than
economists estimated in August because of special payments to
public employees to compensate for income-tax changes.  The average monthly gross wage increased 6.5 percent from a
year earlier to 206,676 forint ($956), the statistics office in
Budapest said in a statement today. The median estimate of 11
economists in a Bloomberg survey was 4.6 percent.  Public wages rose 8 percent and private salaries were up
5.4 percent from August 2010. Regular private wages excluding
bonuses, one of the central bankâ€™s closely watched indicators
for determining inflation expectations, increased 4.8 percent in
August from a year ago, statistician Szilvia Vasas said in a
telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
