Michelin today releases its pick of
the  San Francisco  area’s best-value restaurants, naming 77 where
you may eat well for $40 or less, plus tax and tip.  Nineteen more venues gain the Bib Gourmand award in the
2012 edition of the guide, Michelin said today in an e-mailed
release. The volume covers a geographic area stretching from  Los
Gatos  in the south to Geyserville in the north. Winners of
Michelin stars will be announced on Oct. 25.  The new selection today includes Cotogna, an Italian
establishment on Jackson Square; Fringale, a French bistro that
is celebrating its 20th anniversary; and Zero Zero, a pizza
restaurant on Folsom Street.  Michelin & Cie. is the world’s second-biggest tiremaker,
after Bridgestone Corp. The French company produced its first
guide in 1900, distributed free of charge (until 1920) and
intended for chauffeurs. It contained practical information,
including street maps and tips on using and repairing tires.  “Michelin Guide San Francisco, Bay Area & Wine Country
2012” will go on sale on Wednesday, Oct. 26, at $18.99.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
