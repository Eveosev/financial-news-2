The U.K. Treasury said households
are going through difficult times because of rising prices while
backing the view from the Bank of England that inflation
will slow “rapidly” next year.  “The government understands that these are difficult times
for households, as  price levels  continue to be affected by high
global oil and gas prices,” the Treasury in  London  said in an
e-mailed statement today following publication of
September’s inflation data. “The impact of rising energy prices
in September was in line with previous forecasts by the Bank of
England, who has also said that inflation should then fall
rapidly in 2012. The government is taking action to help
consumers with current high costs, including cutting fuel duty
and freezing council tax, and the prime minister met yesterday
with energy suppliers to discuss how to bring down customers’
energy bills.”  Consumer prices rose 5.2 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 4.5 percent in August, the  Office for National
Statistics  said in London today. That matched the record high
reached in September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
