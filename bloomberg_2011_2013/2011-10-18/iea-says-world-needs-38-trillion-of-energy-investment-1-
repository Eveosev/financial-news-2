Investments totalling $38 trillion
are needed to meet projected global energy demand through 2035,
and unrest in the  Middle East  and North Africa may disrupt this
spending, according to the International Energy Agency.  Energy supplies may be threatened if unrest in energy-
producing countries curbs oil and gas projects,  Fatih Birol ,
chief economist at the adviser to 28 industrialized nations,
said at a press conference in Paris.  “If the investment doesn’t come through in the MENA
region, this will have major implications on international  oil
prices ,” Birol said. MENA countries will account for 90 percent
of crude production growth in the next 10 years, he said. The
IEA projects $16.9 trillion will need to be spent on power-
generation infrastructure through 2035, or 45 percent of the
total investment required to meet energy demand. That compares
with $10 trillion on oil, $9.5 trillion on natural gas, $1.1
trillion on coal and $300 billion on biofuels.  “We believe electricity is the solution” to meeting
growing demand, Fulvio Conti, chief executive officer of Enel
SpA, said at the conference. “It’s the cheapest, cleanest and
easiest” energy source that can be distributed, he said. Enel
is  Italy ’s biggest power company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
