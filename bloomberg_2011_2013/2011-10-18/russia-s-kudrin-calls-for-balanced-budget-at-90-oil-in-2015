 The Kremlin should aim for a
deficit-free  balanced budget for 2015 at an average price of
$90 per barrel of oil, former Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said.  Russia needs a “new model” for economic growth “based on
the growth of private investment, supported by a stable
financial system with low inflation,” Kudrin wrote in an
opinion  article  in Kommersant today.  Russia will have a balanced budget this year assuming an
average price of $108 a barrel for Urals crude oil, the
country’s main export blend. The current average for Urals in
2011 is $109.22 per barrel, data show.  President  Dmitry Medvedev  accepted Kudrin’s resignation as
finance minister Sept. 26 after the government’s then second-
longest serving minister questioned the president’s spending
policies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
