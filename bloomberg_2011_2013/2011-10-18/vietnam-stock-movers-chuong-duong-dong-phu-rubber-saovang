Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Vietnam trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Ho Chi Minh City.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, fell for a second day, dropping 1.6 percent to
404.32, the lowest since Aug. 25.  Rubber Stocks: Dong Phu Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (DPR VN),
the second-largest listed producer, fell 5 percent to 47,500
dong, the biggest drop since Dec. 18. Saovang Rubber Joint-Stock
Co. (SRC VN), slid 4.2 percent to 11,400 dong. Danang Rubber
Joint-Stock Co. (DRC VN) lost 2.6 percent to 19,000 dong, the
lowest since Aug. 12.  Rubber dropped the most in more than two weeks as a
deepening European debt crisis and slower-than-expected economic
growth in  China  raised concerns that demand for the commodity
may weaken.  Chuong Duong Beverages Joint-Stock Co. (SCD VN), a soft-
drinks producer, gained for a fifth day, rising 4.8 percent to
15,200 dong, the highest since Sept. 27. The company’s third-
quarter net profit almost doubled to 4.4 billion dong
($210,000), from 2.3 billion dong a year earlier, according to
figures on the exchange’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
