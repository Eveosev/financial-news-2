U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
rose by more than the seasonal average last week as warmer-than-
normal weather reduced demand for the heating fuel, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories gained 110 billion cubic feet, or 3.1 percent,
to 3.631 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Oct. 14, based on
the median of eight estimates. The five-year average stockpile
change for the week is an increase of 58 billion, according to
Energy Department data. Supplies climbed 93 billion cubic feet a
year earlier.  Temperatures were mostly above-normal last week across the
continental U.S., according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland . The low temperature in  New York  on Oct. 11
was 62 degrees Fahrenheit (17 Celsius), 11 above normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  “Last week’s storage injection was pretty big, and this
week’s weather dynamics were even more favorable to a large
build,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics,
an energy advisory company in Austin,  Texas . “Heating and
cooling demand were at a minimum.”  The Energy Department’s weekly supply report is scheduled
for release at 10:30 a.m. on Oct. 20.  About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Schenker predicted a stockpile increase of 120 billion
cubic feet. The inventory estimates ranged from increases of 104
billion to 120 billion.  A department report last week showed inventories may rise
to 3.77 trillion by Nov. 1, near a record 3.84 trillion last
year, Bloomberg data show.  Natural gas futures rose 22.2 cents, or 6.4 percent, to
$3.703 per million British thermal units last week on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Prices today fell 13.5 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $3.553 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
