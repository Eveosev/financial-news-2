More than half of 208 players
screened at the Under-17  World Cup  in Mexico failed a drug test
for banned stimulant clenbuterol,  soccer ruling body FIFA  said
in an e-mail.  Zurich-based FIFA said last week there’s “compelling”
evidence from the tournament held in June and July of Mexican
meat being contaminated with the drug. Farmers sometimes use
clenbuterol illegally to bulk up cattle.  In an e-mail, FIFA said 109 of 208 players tested had
traces of clenbuterol in their urine.  Alberto Contador is blaming a failed test for clenbuterol
in winning last year’s Tour de France on meat bought in Spain.
Contador was acquitted in February by the Spanish cycling
federation, although cycling’s ruling body,  Union Cycliste
Internationale , and the  World Anti-Doping Agency  are appealing
the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.  The top sports tribunal has scheduled a four-day hearing
into Contador’s case starting Nov. 21.  On Oct. 12, citing FIFA’s research, the Montreal-based
anti-doping agency withdrew an appeal against five Mexican
soccer players who tested positive for clenbuterol at the
Concacaf Gold Cup in June.  Athletes travelling to  Mexico  should “exercise extreme
caution” about what they eat and try to eat together in large
numbers, the agency said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
