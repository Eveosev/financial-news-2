President  Jeffrey Lacker  said he believes the central bank
should soon start removing monetary stimulus.  “A case can be made that withdrawing stimulus may be
warranted soon,” Lacker told reporters today after a speech in
Salisbury,  Maryland . “We should not be adding monetary stimulus
at this point.”  Lacker said that “last month’s worth of data confirm”
that the “probability of a downturn” is “pretty remote.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
