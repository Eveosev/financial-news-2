The  Orthodox Church of Greece 
welcomed a proposal made at its last synod of bishops that it
take over responsibility from the state for paying clergy,  24h 
said, without saying where it got the information.  Chrysostomos, Bishop of  Messinia , who made the proposal, is
collecting data for presentation at the next synod that will
show whether paying the wages of priests is a viable option for
the Church, the Athens-based news website said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
