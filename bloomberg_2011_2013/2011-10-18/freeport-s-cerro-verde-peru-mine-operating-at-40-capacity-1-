Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) ’s Cerro Verde copper mine in  Peru  is operating at 40
percent capacity as the company uses non-union staff to run
operations while unionized workers strike.  The company is using about half of the company’s non-union
staff and supervisors to operate the mine, located 20 miles (32
kilometers) southwest of Arequipa during the dispute over pay,
union official William Camacho said by telephone today.  The strike has not “materially affected” production of
copper concentrate, Phoenix-based spokesman  Eric Kinneberg  said
by e-mail.  Workers will attend government-mediated talks to resolve
the dispute on Oct. 20, Camacho said from Arequipa. “We are
prepared to make one last effort” to resolve the differences,
he said.  Freeport, the world’s largest publicly traded copper
producer, is seeking to negotiate a new wage contract after the
previous one expired Aug. 31.  The company is operating its larger Grasberg mine in
 Indonesia  at 50 percent capacity after stopping operations
because of a workers blockade and a shooting at the mine site
last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
