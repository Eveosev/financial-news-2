European Union biodiesel production
may fall for the first time in 2011 as Argentina and  Indonesia 
increased exports to the region, an industry association said.  Output rose 5.5 percent to 9.57 million metric tons in
2010, the European Biodiesel Board said today in an e-mailed
statement. Output growth slowed from 17 percent in 2009 and 35
percent in 2008, according to the Brussels-based group.  “Forecasts for 2011 show a reduction of European
production compared to the same time last year,” the statement
said. The region’s plants operated at 44 percent in the first
half of this year, according to the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
