Uganda  will start refining oil in
2014, New Vision reported, citing President Yoweri Museveni.  Uganda, which discovered oil in 2006, resisted pressure for
an early production schedule because it would have benefited
“outsiders,” the Kampala-based newspaper said. Oil refining
will give the East African nation financial independence, it
said, citing Museveni.  To contact the reporter on this story:
