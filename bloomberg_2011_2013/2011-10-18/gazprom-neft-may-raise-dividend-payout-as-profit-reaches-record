OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of
Russiaâ€™s gas export monopoly, may raise its dividend payout as a
percentage of net income even as profit climbs to a record,
First Deputy Chief Executive Officer Vadim Yakovlev said.  Gazprom Neft may pay out 23 percent of net income under
U.S. GAAP standards this year, compared with 22 percent last
year, Yakovlev told reporters today in Moscow.   The oil producer expects profit to rise 71 percent to $5.4
billion this year, according to a company presentation to
analysts today in Moscow.  Capital spending  may increase to $4 billion next year from
$3.8 billion this year, Yakovlev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
