Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de
Jager  said euro-area countries must widely and irreversibly
agree on tighter controls over the region in the future as
markets expect a long-term solution to current problems, Die
Welt reported, citing an interview.  The Dutch government said stricter rules must be developed
at the European Union meeting on Oct. 23, and those should be
controlled by the European Commission, the German newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
