Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  has no
intention of selling its Italian phone unit 3 Italia SpA,
Hutchison Managing Director Canning Fok told  Corriere della Sera 
in an interview. “Four mobile operators in Italy aren’t too
many,” he told the newspaper. “If there will be consolidation,
we will be protagonists.” Fok said “there are many
conversations” among phone companies in Europe. “We want to be
consolidators.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
