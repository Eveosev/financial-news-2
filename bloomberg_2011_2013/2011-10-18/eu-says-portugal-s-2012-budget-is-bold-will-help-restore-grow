The European Commission saluted
 Portugal ’s 2012 budget-cut plan as a “bold” step that will
meet deficit targets and help restore economic growth in the
country.  “Our preliminary assessment is that this is a bold
budget,” commission spokesman  Amadeu Altafaj  told reporters in
Brussels today. “It shows the clear commitment of the
government to achieve the 2012 deficit target of below 4.5
percent of GDP through structural measures.”  He called the measures, announced late yesterday,
“courageous.” He welcomed the emphasis on spending cuts rather
than tax increases and efforts to control wages and lengthen
working hours.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
