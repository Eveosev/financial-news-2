Siberia’s grain exports to the
Asian-Pacific region have the potential to reach as much as 13
million metric tons if farmers increase the planted area,
 Russia’s Grain Producers Union  said.  The Siberian Federal District produces 14 million tons of
grain a year on average, of which 2 million to 2.5 million tons
represent a net surplus, Pavel Skurikhin, the union’s president,
said today on its website. The high cost of grain transportation
and poor port infrastructure in  Russia ’s far eastern regions are
hampering the development of sowing areas and grain exports,
Skurikhin said.  Skurikhin was part of a Russian grain business delegation
to  Tokyo , the union said. He proposed agreements between Russian
and Japanese companies to build silos and grain terminals in
areas including Siberia, as a means of boosting grain exports to
the Asian Pacific countries, the union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
