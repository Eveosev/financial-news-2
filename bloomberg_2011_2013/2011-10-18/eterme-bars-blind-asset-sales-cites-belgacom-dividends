Belgian Prime Minister  Yves Leterme 
ruled out a policy of “blindly” privatizing state-owned assets
as a way of cutting the country’s debt.  The state earns good dividends from  Belgacom SA (BELG) , the
country’s largest phone company, and “I don’t want to throw
that out,” Leterme said on Belgian radio today. There should be
“no privatization at the wrong time and blindly. We have to
reflect in an intelligent way in the three to four years to come
on undertaking asset sales.”  Leterme also called on the six parties negotiating a new
government to find a “reasonable” way of taxing nuclear power
in order to cut the budget deficit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
