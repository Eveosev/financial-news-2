The ruble depreciated for a second
day against the dollar as weaker-than-expected Chinese growth
spurred concern demand for oil in the world’s largest energy
consumer may decline.  The Russian currency lost 1 percent, its biggest daily drop
since Oct. 3, to 31.2275 per dollar by the 7 p.m. close in
Moscow. The ruble slid 0.4 percent to 42.7410 per euro, leaving
it down 0.7 percent at 36.4086 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Emerging-market currencies and stocks fell after Moody’s
Investors Service said  France ’s top credit rating is under
pressure and  China ’s economy grew at the slowest pace in two
years in the third quarter, a sign that demand for oil, Russia’s
chief export earner, may weaken. Urals crude fell 0.5 percent to
$110.87 a barrel after losing three percent yesterday.  “If we finally see oil and commodity prices correct
aggressively weaker, it would be a game-changer in terms of the
outlook for the ruble,” Tim Ash, head of emerging-market
research at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London , said by
e-mail. “Given the experience of 2008 and 2009, the central
bank might not be willing to stand in the line of fire defending
the undefendable.”  Bank Rossii manages the ruble against a so-called floating
corridor that currently stands at 32.70 to 37.70 against the
basket, First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  told reporters in
Moscow Oct. 10. The bank sells foreign-currency reserves to stem
depreciation when the Russian currency nears the upper limits of
the corridor, and shifts the corridor by five kopeks when daily
interventions top $600 million.  Lehman’s Collapse  Russia, which relies on oil and gas for as much as 40
percent of budget revenue, needs Urals to average $108 a barrel
to balance its budget this year. The average for 2011 so far is
$109.23, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. pushed Urals
crude down 56 percent to $41.83 a barrel in the fourth quarter
of 2008, triggering a 13 percent drop in the ruble’s rate to the
basket and forcing the central bank to drain a third of its
foreign-currency reserves in the six months through January 2009
to slow the decline.  The country needs a “new model” for economic growth,
former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin wrote in an opinion
article in Kommersant today.  Russia  should aim for a deficit-
free budget in 2015 at an average oil price of $90 per barrel,
he said.  Russia’s $3.5 billion of international bonds due 2020 rose
for a tenth day, the longest winning streak in more than seven
months. The notes have climbed every trading day since Oct. 4,
pushing the yield down 82 basis points, or 0.82 percentage
point, to 4.65 percent, the lowest since Sept. 21.  The yield on similar-maturity Brazilian notes lost 18 basis
points over the same period, to 3.722 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Urals has jumped 10 percent since Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
