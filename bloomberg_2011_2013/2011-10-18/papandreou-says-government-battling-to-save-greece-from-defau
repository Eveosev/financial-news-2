The Greek government is struggling
to save the country from default and there are no magical
solutions, Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said.  “This government has been fighting for two years to save
the country and still has much work ahead,” Papandreou told
lawmakers of his ruling Pasok party today. His comments were
televised live on state-run Vouli TV.  “ Greece  is being held hostage by strikes and protests, and
they will not help Greece,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
