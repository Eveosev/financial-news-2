Sharkia National Food (SNFC)  led gains
among Egyptian food producers after  Saudi Arabia ’s Savola Al-
Azizia United Co. bought stakes in two local food companies.  Cairo-based Sharkia climbed to the highest level in more
than three weeks.  Middle & West Delta Flour Mills (WCDF) , a producer of
flour, bread and pasta increased 2.6 percent. The benchmark EGX
30 Index retreated 0.8 percent at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo.  Savola  said  its Egyptian unit agreed to buy 78 percent of
pasta makers al-Malika and al-Farasha for 556.5 million Egyptian
pounds ($93 million). The companies own two factories in  Egypt 
with a production capacity of 120,000 tons per year and a market
share of 30 percent, Savola said in a statement today.  “There definitely could be more consolidation in the
fragmented food market,” said Wafaa Baddour, equity analyst at
Cairo-based investment bank EFG-Hermes Holding SAE.
“Speculation will increase regarding possible mergers and
acquisitions in the food sector, but it will all depend on each
company’s circumstances.”  Sharkia gained 4 percent to 4.91 pounds. Middle & West
Delta closed at 46.95 pounds, the highest since July 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
