Poland’s WIG20 Index advanced 2.52,
or 0.1 percent, to 2,288.43 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
extending this month’s gain to 4.6 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Getin Holding SA (GTN)   gained 1.7 percent to 8.47 zloty,
the biggest increase in almost a week. The financial-services
group controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki was upgraded to
“hold” from “sell” at ING Groep NV.  Globe Trade Centre SA (GTC)  , Poland’s biggest property
developer by market value, jumped the most in almost two weeks,
increasing 4.5 percent to 12.49 zloty. JPMorgan Chase & Co. kept
its “overweight” recommendation, with a share-price projection
of 14.5 zloty.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, lost 0.8 percent to 144.4 zloty,
falling for a second day. Copper dropped as economic growth
slowed to a two-year low in China, the top global consumer of
the metal.  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)   rose for the first time in four
days, adding 1.1 percent to 14.29 zloty. The Polish bank that
KBC Groep NV is seeking to sell was upgraded to “buy” from
“hold” at UniCredit SpA.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , Poland’s second-largest refiner,
increased 1.2 percent to 26.41 zloty, extending this month’s
gain to 4.6 percent, as crude oil advanced, erasing an earlier
decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
