The premiums for U.S. Gulf Coast
oils weakened as West Texas Intermediate crude’s discount to
Brent oil narrowed the second consecutive day.  The gap between WTI and Brent December contracts weakened
92 cents to $22.62 at settlement. The spread for prompt month
contracts settled at a record $27.88 a barrel Oct. 14.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed $2.20 to
$25.40 a barrel while Light Louisiana Sweet lost $2 to $25.50
above the U.S. benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend decreased $2.15 to $21.10 a barrel and Poseidon lost $4.10
to $19 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium weakened $5.25 to $18 a
barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 70 cents
a barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium decreased $2.50 to $22.75
above the benchmark.  Bakken oil’s premium lost $1.25 a barrel to $1.50 above the
U.S. benchmark.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed $1.25 a
barrel to $9.25 below the price for WTI.  Syncrude’s premium to WTI strengthened 40 cents to $9.15 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
