Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending rate, opened at 0.08 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.07 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.12 percent and averaging 0.07 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from
February 2036 to August 2041. The purchases are part of the
Fed’s program to replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce
borrowing costs further and counter rising risks of a recession.  The central bank plans to purchase from $2.25 billion to
$2.75 billion of securities today, according to the New York
Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
