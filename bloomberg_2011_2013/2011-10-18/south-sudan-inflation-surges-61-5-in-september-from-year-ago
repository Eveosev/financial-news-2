Consumer prices in South Sudan, an
oil producer that became an independent nation this year, jumped
by 61.5 percent in September compared with a year earlier as the
cost of food surged, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said.  The inflation rate accelerated from 57.1 percent in August,
the Juba-based agency said in a statement on its website today.
Prices rose 0.8 percent in the month, it said. The price of
food, the largest contributor to the index with a 71.4 percent
weighting, advanced an annual 65.3 percent, the agency said.  It is the first time that the  Consumer Price Index  extended
beyond Juba to include the towns of Malakal and Wau, the agency
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
