Rules scheduled to take effect last
July for the $601 trillion swaps market may be delayed as long
as a year under a proposal by the U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission .  The agency’s commissioners voted 5-0 today to propose
delaying until as late as July 16, 2012, rules that were
required to take effect in mid-July under the Dodd-Frank Act.  If finalized, the rule would be the second time the agency
has delayed the effective date of Dodd-Frank rules. The proposal
will be open to public comment for 30 days; the commission is
expected to finalize the postponement by the end of the year.  In July, the agency approved an order granting “temporary
relief” from legal requirements to give the CFTC more time to
write dozens of rules aimed at reducing risk and boosting
transparency after largely unregulated trades helped fuel the
2008 credit crisis.  CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  said on Oct. 3 that the agency
would likely vote in the first quarter of 2012 on several Dodd-
Frank rules, including regulations governing exchanges and other
trading facilities.  The regulations will govern trades conducted by  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Cargill Inc. and other
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
