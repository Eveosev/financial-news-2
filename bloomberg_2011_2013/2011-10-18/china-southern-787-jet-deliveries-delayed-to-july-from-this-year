China Southern Airlines Co.,  Asia ’s
largest carrier by passenger numbers, said it may join  China
Eastern  Airlines Corp. in scrapping orders for  Boeing Co. (BA)  787
planes after delivery of its first plane was delayed until July.  The arrival of the first of China Southern’s 10 Dreamliners
on order has been delayed from around year-end because of
certification issues, Chief Financial Officer Xu Jiebo said
today by phone from Guangzhou, China. He didn’t elaborate on
what the hold-up was.  “We won’t rule out the possibility of canceling or
adjusting the 787 orders, if there is a huge gap between the
plane’s functionality or delivery date and our requirements,”
he said. The Guangzhou, China-based airline will seek
compensation from Boeing for the late delivery, he said.  China Eastern, the nation’s second-biggest carrier,
yesterday swapped orders for 24 Dreamliners for smaller planes,
citing late delivery and waning international  travel demand .
Boeing handed over the first 787 to All Nippon Airways Co. in
September, ending more than three years of delays caused by the
use of new materials and production processes.  Boeing’s China spokesman Wang Yukui said he couldn’t
immediately comment on the China Southern order or the 787’s
progress in winning approval in China. Three calls to the  Civil
Aviation Authority  of China went unanswered.  Regulators’ Approval  The Chicago-based planemaker received certification for the
787 from the U.S.’s Federal Aviation Administration, the
European Aviation Safety Agency and  Japan ’s Civil Aviation
Bureau in  August . Boeing has won orders for more than 800 of the
planes, making it the company’s fastest-selling jet ever.  “As we look forward, we expect to see the Dreamliner order
base increase, we expect to see more orders, we expect to see
more cancellations, especially as we go through mitigation with
our customers,”  Randy Tinseth , Boeing’s marketing chief, said
today in Seoul, in remarks confirmed by the company.  Airlines generally have to pay penalties if they cancel
orders, while planemakers face charges if they don’t deliver
planes on time or if the jets don’t perform as expected.  Air China Ltd. (601111) , the nation’s largest international carrier,
said by text message that there are no changes in its order for
15 787s. The planes are due to be delivered from the end of 2015
to mid-2018. Hainan Airlines Co.’s 10 787s are also still
expected over the next two years, said Wu Feng, a press officer
at parent HNA Group.  China Southern fell 8.5 percent in  Hong Kong  trading, the
most in two weeks, to close at HK$4.29. Dow Jones reported the
787 delivery delay earlier today.  Air China, the nation’s biggest international carrier,
dropped 6.2 percent to HK$5.78. China Eastern declined 8.8
percent to HK$2.60. Boeing rose 2.7 percent to $63.47 in New
York trading.  Shanghai-based  China  Eastern yesterday said it was
switching its 787 orders for 45 737-800s. The carrier is also
returning five A340-300s to Airbus SAS in exchange for 15
smaller wide-body A330s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
