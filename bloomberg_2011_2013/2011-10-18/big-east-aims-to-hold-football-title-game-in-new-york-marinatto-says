The Big East Conference might hold
an annual football title game in  New York  when it expands to 12
teams, Commissioner John Marinatto said on a conference call.  The Providence, Rhode Island-based college sports league,
which has only six football members left, hasnâ€™t yet invited
schools to join, Marinatto said. The conference holds its end-
of-season basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
