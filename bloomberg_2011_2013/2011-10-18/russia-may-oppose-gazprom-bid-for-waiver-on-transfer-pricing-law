Russia ’s Finance Ministry opposes
exempting OAO Gazprom from new transfer-pricing rules next year,
which could open up the gas producer and pipeline monopoly to
fines for non-market transactions.  “I hope we will do without waivers for Gazprom”, Deputy
Finance Minister Sergei Shatalov told reporters in Moscow today.
“Transfer-pricing legislation should apply to it in full.”  Gazprom asked the government to treat all transactions with
its subsidiaries as market-based, excluding it from transfer-
pricing monitoring, Vedomosti said yesterday. The law allows the
authorities to crack down on transactions between affiliates
using non-market prices, the newspaper said.  “The indulgence that Gazprom is requesting may help the
company avoid fines and penalties that could arise with the
upcoming amendments of the  tax code ,” Pavel Sorokin, an analyst
at  Alfa Bank , said yesterday in a note. “On the other hand, the
exclusion could encourage further inefficiencies within the
group’s operations” by shielding them from monitoring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
