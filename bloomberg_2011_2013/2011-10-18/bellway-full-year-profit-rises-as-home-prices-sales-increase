Bellway Plc (BWY) , the U.K. homebuilder
focused on first-time buyers, said annual profit rose 51 percent
after the company sold more homes at higher prices.  Net income for the 12 months through July climbed to 50.1
million pounds ($79 million) from 35.8 million pounds a year
earlier, the Newcastle, England-based company said today in a
statement. That beat 48.3 million pounds, the average of five
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Against a backdrop of ongoing economic uncertainty, the
housing market has stabilized and the group, in general, has
performed very well in the year,” Chairman Howard Dawe said in
the statement.  Homebuilders are boosting profit margins by building houses
rather than apartments and using less expensive land acquired
during the global recession that ended in 2009. The U.K.
government yesterday ended a consultation on policies that seek
to nurture the economy by simplifying planning laws.  Bellway rose 21 pence, or 3.1 percent, to 698.5 pence in
 London  trading, the biggest gainer in the FTSE 350 household
goods and home construction index. The stock has gained 4.3
percent this year, giving the homebuilder a market value of
844.1 million pounds.  The company completed sales of 4,922 homes, up from 4,595
homes a year earlier, and the average selling price increased
7.6 percent to 175,613 pounds. The company increased its full-
year dividend to 8.8 pence a share from 6.7 pence a year
earlier.  Reservations in the first nine weeks of fiscal 2012 are
almost 11 percent higher than the same period last year.  London Homes  The completion of a number of developments around London,
where a typical home sells for more than 250,000 pounds, and a
switch from apartments to family homes outside London increased
the average sale price.  Legally completed sales in their northern divisions rose 18
percent to 2,345 and prices remained broadly static. The
southern division saw average selling prices rise 13.1 percent
and sales volumes were 2,577, similar to the previous year.  Some first-time buyers in London are using large deposits
when purchasing, Chief Executive Officer John Watson said in a
telephone interview. “The typical response is: ‘my mother and
father have helped me.’ So I’m finding that a little bit in
London, but in the rest of the country that’s not replicated,”
he said.  Bellway spent 250 million pounds during the year on land
and land creditors, who are sellers paid closer to the time
construction starts. Most of the land was bought in the south of
the U.K. “We’ve grown our land bank and will continue to do
that,” Watson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
