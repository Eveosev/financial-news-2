Corn prices may be lower than the
U.S. government forecast as economic weakness curbs demand for
the grain, said Chad Hart, an extension economist at  Iowa State
University  in Ames.  Spot-market corn prices may average $6.20 a bushel in the
year that ends Aug. 31, Hart said today in an interview in
Chicago. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Oct. 12  estimated 
prices in a range from $6.20 to $7.20. The grain may average
$5.80 in the year that starts Sept. 1, 2012, Hart said.  “Corn is tight, but the general economy is weak,” Hart
said, citing slowing growth in the U.S.,  China  and countries
that share the euro. “From a crop perspective, that means lower
expectations on the export side. If demand is pulling back, you
just can’t maintain prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
