Crude oil inventories fell 3.13
million barrels to 337.3 million last week, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.64 million barrels to 209.6
million, the report showed.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rose 572,000
barrels to 31.1 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil rose
2 million barrels last week, according to the median of 13
responses in a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline inventories
probably fell 1.5 million barrels, the survey showed.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for November delivery rose $1.94, or 2.2 percent,
to $88.32 a barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The contract, which settled at $88.34,
traded at $88.40 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
