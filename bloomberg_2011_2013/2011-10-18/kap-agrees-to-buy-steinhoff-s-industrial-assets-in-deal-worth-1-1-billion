KAP International Holdings Ltd. (KAP) , a
South African company with manufacturing investments, said it
will acquire  Steinhoff International Holdings Ltd. (SHF) ’s industrial
assets in a deal valued at 8.92 billion rand ($1.1 billion).  Steinhoff’s holding in KAP will rise to 88 percent from 34
percent after Cape Town-based KAP issues new shares. KAP will
also credit a loan account for about 4.14 billion rand in favor
of Steinhoff, the company said in a statement today.  The acquisition will leave KAP “better positioned” to
capture growth opportunities in southern Africa, the company
said. “The enlarged diversified industrial business is expected
to be better placed to access capital both in the debt and
equity markets at competitive rates and pricing,” KAP said.  Steinhoff,  Africa ’s largest furniture maker, is selling
timber operator PG Bison, the Unitrans supply-chain business and
Steinhoff  Raw Materials . Steinhoff is focused on European
expansion after acquiring rival Conforama for 1.2 billion euros
in January.  KAP rose 10 percent to 2.42 rand at the close in
Johannesburg, the biggest gain since Jan. 11. Steinhoff declined
0.8 percent to 22.49 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
