Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ) , which aims to get 30 percent of its revenue from the
Asia-Pacific area by 2017, plans to increase its number of
wealthy clients in Vietnam to 10,000 from 1,000 in three years.  The Melbourne-based Bank plans in the next two to three
months to double the number of staff catering to individuals
with a minimum investment threshold of $50,000, Tareq Muhmood,
the bank’s chief executive officer for the southeast Asian
country, said in an interview in Hanoi yesterday. ANZ’s service
for high-net-worth individuals in the country has attracted
1,000 customers since its launch twelve months ago, he said.  “You’re looking at high-end professionals, or
entrepreneurs who have built up their business, and you clearly
have more than 10,000 in  Vietnam ,” he said.  The bank also plans to offer structured notes, or
securities created to offer customized bets for investors, to
wealthy clients, Muhmood said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
