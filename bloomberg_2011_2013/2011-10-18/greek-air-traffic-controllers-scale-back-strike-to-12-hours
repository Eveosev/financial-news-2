Greek air traffic controllers will
strike for 12 hours tomorrow, scaling back an original plan to
walk out for 48 hours, a spokeswoman at Athens International
Airport said. The change will allow flights scheduled for after
midday to depart as scheduled, she said.  Air traffic controllers havenâ€™t yet decided on their strike
plans for Oct. 20, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
