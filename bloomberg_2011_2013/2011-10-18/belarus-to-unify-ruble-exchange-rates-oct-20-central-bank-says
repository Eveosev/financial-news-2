Belarus  will unify  its ruble
exchange rates on Oct. 20, easing foreign-currency trading, the
country’s central bank said today.  Companies importing medicine, electricity and natural gas
buy foreign currency at an official rate set by the central bank
on the Belarusian Currency and Stock Exchange in Minsk. All
others purchase dollars and euros at a rate established by
supply and demand in a special session where dollars currently
trade 56 percent above the official rate of 5,692 rubles per
dollar.  The central bank aims to conduct “minimal currency
interventions, only aimed at smoothing out sharp swings of the
exchange rate,” the regultor said in a statement on its website
today.  The plan to unify the exchange rates is a “step forward,”
 Chris Jarvis , head of the International Monetary Fund mission to
Belarus, said in a press conference in Minsk on Oct. 17. Belarus
is seeking a bail-out loan of up to $7 billion from the IMF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
