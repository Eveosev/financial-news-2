German shipper E.R. Schiffahrt GmbH
& Cie. KG is looking to buy or merge with other companies in the
industry to increase competitiveness,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing Chairman Erck Rickmers.  Rickmers is considering to combine with small and medium-
sized German competitors, according to the report. The executive
said a company with 200 to 250 ships would be “more
competitive,” Handelsblatt said, comparing that with E.R.
Schiffahrt’s 101 vessels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
