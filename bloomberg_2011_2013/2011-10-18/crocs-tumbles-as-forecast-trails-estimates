Crocs Inc. (CROX) , maker of the namesake
plastic clogs, fell the most in almost three years after
projecting third-and fourth-quarter revenue that trailed
analysts’ estimates.  Sales for the period ended Sept. 30 probably were $273
million to $275 million, the Niwot, Colorado-based company said
in a statement yesterday. That was lower than a July 27 forecast
of $280 million and the $280.5 million average estimate from
analysts.  Consumers are buying fewer shoes than expected, Crocs said.
The company, which had gained 56 percent this year before today,
has said it plans to counter a possible global economic slowdown
by boosting sales of new, higher-priced styles.  “After a very positive response to our spring/summer 2011
product line in the Americas, we experienced some softness in
our consumer direct channel in kiosk and outlet locations,”
Chief Executive Officer John McCarvel said in the statement.
Gross margin was lower than expectations, he said.  The shares fell 38 percent to $16.63 at 10:02 a.m. New York
time, after earlier touching $16.25 for the biggest intraday
drop since Nov. 13, 2008.  Third-quarter profit will be 31 cents a share to 33 cents a
share, lower than a previous forecast of 40 cents, Crocs said.  Fourth-quarter sales are projected to increase in the “low
teen range” on a percentage basis from a year ago, McCarvel
said. Analysts project $221 million, or a rise of 23 percent,
according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Crocs is scheduled to report complete third-quarter results
on Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
