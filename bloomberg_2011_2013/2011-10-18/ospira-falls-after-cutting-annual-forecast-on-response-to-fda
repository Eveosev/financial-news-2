Hospira Inc. (HSP) , a maker of generic
injectable drugs, declined the most ever after the company
reduced its annual earnings forecast to reflect costs to improve
manufacturing at a  North Carolina  factory.  Hospira slid 21 percent to $29.51 at 4 p.m. New York time,
the biggest drop since the company spun off from  Abbott
Laboratories (ABT)  and shares began trading May 3, 2004. The  Lake
Forest , Illinois-based company expects adjusted earnings for the
year of $2.95 to $3.05 a share, less than the analysts’
consensus estimate of $3.91.  “We were extremely disappointed in the third quarter by
developments related to our quality-improvement initiatives that
resulted in a significant slowdown of production and an
associated impact on our operating performance,” said Hospira
Chief Executive Officer Michael Ball in a statement.  The reduction in projected earnings resulted from costs to
improve quality at the plants. The U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration  in April 2010 identified manufacturing issues at
two North Carolina plants. The concerns at one plant have been
resolved with the FDA and those at another in Rocky Mount, North
Carolina, are still getting addressed, Ball said.  Analyst Downgrade  The Rocky Mount plant makes products comprising about a
quarter of Hospira’s revenue,  Rick Wise , an analyst Leerink
Swann, said in a  note to clients . He downgraded the stock today
to a “market perform” rating from “outperform.”  “It now appears that the manufacturing disruption, time to
resolution and cost to fix all these issues clearly is greater
than expected,” Wise said in his note. He predicted the company
may be dealing with costs from the manufacturing problems until
early 2013.  Hospira recalled two drugs in April 2010 for a second time
in six months because of manufacturing defects, the company said
at the time. The recalled drugs -- Propofol, an anesthetic
agent, and Liposyn, an intravenous nutritional product -- had
been contaminated by particulates during the manufacturing
process, the company said it told the FDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
