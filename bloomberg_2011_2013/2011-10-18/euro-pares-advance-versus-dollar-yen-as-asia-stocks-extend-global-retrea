The euro pared early gains against
the dollar and yen as Asian shares extended a global slump,
curbing demand for riskier assets.  The 17-nation currency rose 0.2 percent to $1.3757 as of
11:36 a.m. in  Tokyo  from the close in  New York  yesterday, after
earlier rising as much as 0.4 percent. The euro was up 0.1
percent to 105.68 yen.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
