Today’s acceleration in U.K.
inflation reflects higher energy prices and any expanded
stimulus for the economy is a matter for the  Bank of England ,
Prime Minister David Cameron’s spokesman said.  “We understand this is a difficult time for households
that are affected by these price rises that reflect what is
happening to global oil and gas prices,” Steve Field told
reporters in  London  today. “The decision to loosen monetary
policy is a decision for the Bank of England. It’s something
they make a judgement on based on their estimate of what’s going
to happen to inflation in the future.”  Field said the Bank of England expects inflation to slow
considerably in the coming months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
