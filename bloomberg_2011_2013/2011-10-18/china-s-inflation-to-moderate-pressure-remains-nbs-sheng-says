China ’s inflation rate will moderate
in the fourth quarter and the trend of rising prices has been
effectively curbed, National Bureau of Statistics spokesman
 Sheng Laiyun  said in Beijing today.  Moderating economic growth, tightened liquidity, a good
grain harvest and falling global commodity prices are all
helping to ease inflationary pressure, he said at a briefing to
discuss China’s third-quarter economic data.  Even so, inflation is still relatively high, Sheng said.
Pressure from imported inflation remains and some long-term
factors influencing prices will persist, such as higher labor
and resource costs, he said.  The decline in the value of some currencies has increased
currency risks for China’s exporters and added to their costs,
he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
