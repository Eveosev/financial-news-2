The  National Basketball Association 
and its players union began federally mediated talks in an
attempt to end a 110-day lockout.  George Cohen, director of the  Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service , is overseeing the talks between the top
negotiators of the NBA and the National Basketball Players
Association at a midtown New York hotel.  The negotiations come eight days after NBA Commissioner
 David Stern  canceled the first two weeks of the season -- which
was scheduled to begin Nov. 1 -- and said he believed it was no
longer possible to fit in a full 82-game schedule.  The only other time NBA games were canceled was during the
1998-99 season, when the sides reached a deal in early January
1999 and a 50-game season began in early February.  Stern said in a televised interview last week that, “If
there’s a breakthrough, it’s going to come on Tuesday.”  “And if not, I think that the season is really going to
potentially escape from us,” Stern told NBA TV.  The two sides are discussing how to split money from a
league that had about $4.3 billion in revenue last season and
what type of system the league will operate under. Stern has
said the league’s 30 teams collectively lost at least $300
million in each of the last three seasons.  The NBA’s owners will be in  New York  this week, beginning
tomorrow with Board of Governors committee meetings and then a
full session in two days. It’s unclear whether tomorrow’s
schedule could keep the two sides from negotiating with Cohen
for more than just today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
