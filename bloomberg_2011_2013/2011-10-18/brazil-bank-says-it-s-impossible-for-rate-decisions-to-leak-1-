Brazil ’s central bank denied that
anyone could have prior knowledge of its decisions after
newspapers reported that Brazil’s securities regulator is
investigating “atypical” movements in interest-rate futures
contracts ahead of a surprise Aug. 31 rate cut.  The bank said it’s “impossible” to learn of decisions in
advance because they are taken in a closed meeting by the board
and then immediately communicated to the public, according to an
e-mailed statement today.  Rio de Janeiro-based O Globo newspaper reported Oct. 15,
citing a person it didn’t name, that the regulator is
investigating because “two or three” unidentified banks
changed their position to bets that policy makers would cut
rates in the days prior to the meeting. Other newspapers,
including O Estado de S.Paulo, also said an investigation is in
progress.  The securities regulator declined to comment in an e-mailed
statement. “The regulator follows these movements regularly,
and doesn’t comment on investigations in progress,” the agency
said in reply to e-mailed questions sent to its press office.  Policy makers cut the benchmark  interest rate  half a point
to 12 percent at their August policy meeting, citing a
“substantial deterioration” in the global economy. The move
surprised the 62 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, who had all
forecast the bank would leave rates unchanged.  To contact the reporters on this story:
