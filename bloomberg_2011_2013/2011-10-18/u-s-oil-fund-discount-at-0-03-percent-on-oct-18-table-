The U.S. Oil Fund, the largest
exchange-traded fund in crude oil, closed at a discount of
0.03 percent on Oct. 18, according to figures on the fundâ€™s
website. A discount means that the closing price of the shares
is lower than the value of its underlying holdings in the fuel.  Crude oil for December delivery rose $1.91, or 2.21
percent, to $88.53 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
on Oct. 18.             
NOTE: The fund aims to track the price of West Texas Intermediate
delivered to Cushing,  Oklahoma . The ETF buys the near-month
contract, then rolls forward by selling it before expiration
and buying the following month.  SOURCE: United States Oil Fund  To contact the reporter on this story:
