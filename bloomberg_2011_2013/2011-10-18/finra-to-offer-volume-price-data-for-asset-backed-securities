 The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority said it will release market activity and pricing-
related tables for securitized products.  The information, which Finra is creating with Interactive
Data Corp., will use data gathered by Trace, the regulatorâ€™s
bond trade-reporting system, according to a statement today from
the Washington-based securities overseer. Trace currently
releases information on trading and prices for individual
corporate bonds. Finra began collecting data this year on
securitized products without releasing the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
