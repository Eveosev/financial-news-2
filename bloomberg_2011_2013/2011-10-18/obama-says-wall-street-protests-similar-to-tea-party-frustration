President  Barack Obama  said the
Occupy  Wall Street  movement was born of many of the same
sentiments that led to the Tea Party movement.  “I understand the frustrations being expressed in those
protests,” Obama said in an interview with ABC News. “In some
ways, they’re not that different from some of the protests that
we saw coming from the Tea Party. Both on the left and the
right, I think people feel separated from their government. They
feel that their institutions aren’t looking out for them.”  The president made the comments in an  interview  with ABC
News correspondent Jake Tapper set for broadcast on the
network’s “Nightline” program tonight. The network released
excerpts from the interview conducted in Jamestown,  North
Carolina . where the president was making a stop on his three-day
bus tour to promote his economic proposals.  Obama said his proposals to raise taxes on the wealthiest
Americans and close some corporate loopholes can help restore a
sense that “everybody gets a fair shake but we’re also asking a
fair share from everybody.”  Doing so will help dissipate some of the anger expressed by
demonstrators, he said.  The protests over income disparity that began in New York’s
financial district have spread as far as Rome and  Hong Kong   To contact the reporter on this story:
