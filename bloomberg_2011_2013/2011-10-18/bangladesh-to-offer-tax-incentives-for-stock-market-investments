Bangladesh ’s government will offer
tax incentives to boost stock-market investments, including a
waiver on income from mutual funds, the nation’s market
regulator said.  The government has revived a tax rebate on investment in
stocks, M. Khairul Hossain, chairman of the  Securities and
Exchange Commission , told reporters in Dhaka yesterday, citing
orders by the National Board of Revenue. He didn’t provide more
details. The revenue board, Bangladesh’s tax-collection agency,
has waived a 10 percent tax on income from mutual funds and
reduced a tax on brokerage commissions to 0.05 percent from 0.10
percent, Hossain said.  The Dhaka Stock Exchange’s benchmark General Index has
tumbled 35 percent this year, set for its worst annual drop
since a 67 percent plunge in 1997, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The gauge rose 0.7 percent to 5,423.92 yesterday.  The tax rebate and waiver on income from mutual funds
“will be effective retrospectively from July,” Hossain said,
while the reduction in tax on commissions took effect yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
