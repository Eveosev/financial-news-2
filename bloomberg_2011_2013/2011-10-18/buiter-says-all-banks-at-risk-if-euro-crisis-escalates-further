Willem Buiter said all banks in advanced economies could be at
risk if European leaders lose control of the region’s sovereign-
debt crisis.  “If things get out of hand in the euro area, no bank in
the financial-integrated world will stand,” Buiter told
lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing in  London  today.  Banks and other systemically-important financial
institutions need to be recapitalized before any sovereign
restructurings of euro-zone members with high debt levels such
as Greece or  Portugal , the economist said. “If they don’t, we
are setting ourselves up for a financial crisis following the
sovereign crisis,” he said.  European leaders are due to meet in Brussels on Oct. 23,
followed by a meeting of Group of 20 nations in Cannes,  France ,
on Nov. 3-4.  “I don’t expect that there will be a grand plan, a grand
design, even a big bazooka for that matter, on Oct. 23 when the
European heads of government meet, or on Nov. 4,” Buiter said.  “There will be some progress, but very limited,” he told
members of the House of Lords European Union Economic and
Financial Affairs Sub-Committee. “It’s going to take months,
probably well in 2012, before we have clarity about how Spain
and  Italy  will be ring fenced, guaranteed funding, how the banks
will be recapitalized and how much of them will end up being
majority stated owned -- I expect a significant number of
them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
