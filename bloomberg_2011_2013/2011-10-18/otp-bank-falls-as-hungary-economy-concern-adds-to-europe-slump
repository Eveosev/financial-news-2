OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, fell for a second day as concern that the country’s
economy will slow more than forecast added to a slump in
European stocks.  OTP’s shares fell 1.8 percent to 3,340 forint by 11:55 a.m.
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX index, in which OTP has a 27
percent weighting, fell 1.4 percent.  Hungary’s budget deficit will probably exceed the
government’s target next year as public finance savings and
growth may miss forecasts, central bank President Andras Simor
told a parliamentary hearing today. Growth may slow to 0.6
percent next year, compared with the Cabinet’s 1.5 percent
estimate on which it based the 2012 budget draft, he said.  Societe Generale SA holds a “firmly negative view on
Hungarian assets,” London-based economist Guillaume Salomon
wrote in a research report today, citing fears Hungary’s  credit
rating  will be downgraded to below investment grade.  Standard & Poor’s , which rates Hungary BBB- with a negative
outlook, may downgrade the country “in the coming weeks,”
 Raffaella Tenconi , an analyst with Bank of America, said in an
e-mailed note yesterday.  European stocks fell as concern that France may lose its
top credit rating added pressure on the region’s leaders to find
a solution to the debt crisis and as China’s economy grew at the
slowest pace in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
