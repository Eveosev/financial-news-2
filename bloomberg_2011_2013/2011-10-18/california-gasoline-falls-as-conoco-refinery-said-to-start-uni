California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  fell to the lowest level in more than two weeks after
the Energy Department reported that U.S. fuel consumption
declined last week.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles fell 6.62 cents to 21.88 cents a gallon above
gasoline futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
4:17 p.m. East Coast time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the lowest premium for the fuel since Oct. 3.  Overall U.S. fuel use declined 2.2 percent to 18.3 million
barrels a day last week, the department said today. Consumption
hit the lowest level since May in the second-straight weekly
decline, according to government data.  San Francisco Carbob slipped 6.62 cents to a premium of
15.88 cents over gasoline futures.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Portland ,  Oregon , fell 12 cents to 26 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
