The  Philippines  rejected all bids
for 91-day Treasury bills at a second straight auction after
selling about 110 billion pesos ($2.5 billion) worth of bonds
targeted to individuals this week.  The Treasury also spurned bids for six-month bills for a
third consecutive auction. It accepted offers for one-year 
securities at an average yield of 1.75 percent, compared with
1.133 percent when the notes were last sold on Sept. 19,
official data showed. The yield on the three-month notes would
have climbed to 1.941 percent and the 182-day yield would have
risen to 2.292 percent had the government accepted bids today.
That compares with 0.69 percent and 0.682 percent, respectively,
when the securities were last sold on Sept. 5.  The government offered 10- and 15-year retail bonds this
month and used 53 billion pesos of its own funds to buy the debt,
according to a Treasury statement today. Spending cuts narrowed
the Philippines’  budget deficit  to 34.49 billion pesos in the
first eight months of 2011, or just 15 percent of the shortfall
a year earlier.  “They’re cash-rich after the retail bond sale, previous
borrowing and modest spending and can afford to reject to keep
borrowing costs low,” said Bunny Bernardo-Recto, vice president
at Manila-based Chinatrust Philippines Commercial Bank Corp.  The Philippines will stick to the borrowing plan it had set
for the year and consider options for debt management even after
the sale of retail bonds, Treasurer  Roberto Tan  said today.
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will keep its benchmark overnight
borrowing rate at 4.5 percent on Oct. 20, according to all 17
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter for this story:
