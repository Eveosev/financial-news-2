Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ,
the world’s largest generic drugmaker, dropped in  New York  for
the first day in three after its  Parkinson’s disease  treatment
failed to win the backing of a panel advising U.S. regulators.  Teva dropped 1.2 percent to $38.84 at 11:28 a.m., and
contributed the most to a 0.6 percent decline on the Bloomberg
Israel-US 25 Index of the largest Israeli companies traded in
New York. The Tel Aviv shares retreated 0.1 percent to 143.90
shekels, or the equivalent of $39.36. The 57-cent discount of
the New York shares was the largest among the biggest Israeli
companies traded in New York.  An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration, by a
17-0 vote after the close of trading yesterday, found that there
wasn’t “compelling evidence” that 1-2 milligram doses of the
drugmaker’s Azilect treatment slowed progression of Parkinson’s
disease.  Par Pharmaceutical Cos. said today in a separate statement
distributed by PRNewswire that it bought three generic drugs
from Teva following the Israeli company’s acquisition of
Cephalon Inc.  Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP) , the world’s second-
largest maker of network security equipment, rose 0.2 percent to
$58.13 in New York after reporting third-quarter adjusted
earnings per share of 72 cents, above the 70 cents average
estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
