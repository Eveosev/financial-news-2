Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  cut its
forecasts for the benchmark stock indexes of  Canada  and the U.S.
for the first time since 2008, citing the risk of a new U.S.
recession and analysts’ cuts to earnings estimates.  Vincent Delisle, a Montreal-based strategist at Canada’s
third-largest lender by assets, reduced his 12- to 18-month
estimate for the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index to 13,750
from the 14,750 forecast set in April. He also reduced his
estimate for the S&P 500 to 1,400 from July forecast of 1,450.
Profits for S&P/TSX companies should come in lower than
previously forecast, he wrote in a note to clients.  “Negative earnings revisions have weighed on sentiment
recently,” Delisle wrote in a note sent to clients yesterday.
“Looking at the decline in key commodities and slower world
gross domestic product growth in 2012, TSX revisions may be more
vulnerable in the near term.”  The S&P/TSX closed at 11,923.04 yesterday, down 16 percent
from April 5. The index declined as oil dropped 20 percent and
copper lost 21 percent. Energy and raw-materials companies make
up 48 percent of Canadian stocks by market value, according to
Bloomberg data. The  S&P 500  closed yesterday at 1,200.86.  Scotiabank cut its 2012 price forecasts for oil and copper
earlier this month. The U.S. has a 30 percent chance of entering
a recession next year, Delisle wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
