Almost two thirds of staff at the
 European Central Bank  say  Jean-Claude Trichet  has been a
“good” or an “excellent” president, according to a survey by
trade union IPSO.  More than 64 percent of the 507 ECB staff surveyed
responded favorably when asked to rate Trichet’s overall
performance during his eight-year term, Frankfurt-based IPSO
said in a statement. While 55 percent agreed that Trichet had
exceeded the bank’s mandate, 53 percent of those that did said
the measures were justified by the circumstances.  Italian central bank president  Mario Draghi  will succeed
Trichet when his term ends on Oct. 31. The Frenchman, who guided
the central bank through the global recession, leaves as
 Europe ’s debt crisis now threatens the future of the currency
bloc he helped to design. Trichet has introduced a string of
balance-sheet tools to combat the crisis, including the purchase
of sovereign bonds -- a measure some officials say exceeds the
ECB’s price-stability mandate.  Survey respondents said Trichet preformed better externally
than internally. While more than 70 percent said Trichet had
improved the ECB’s reputation and communicated clearly to
financial markets, more than half said his internal reforms were
not successful and his actions failed to live up to his
assertion that staff are the most valuable asset.  The survey was carried out over a three-week period ending
on Sept. 22. The trade union says it represents around 40
percent of the ECB’s 1502 staff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
