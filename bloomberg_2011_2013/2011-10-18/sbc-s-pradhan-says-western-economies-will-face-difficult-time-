Tushar Pradhan, who manages $1
billion as chief investment officer at HSBC Asset Management
( India ) Pvt., comments on the outlook for the country’s equities
in an interview with Bloomberg UTV.  The benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index lost 1.6 percent to
16,748.29 at close in Mumbai.  On the global economic crisis:  “The fundamentals of most European nations are so weak
that it is going to take a long time for any sort of growth
environment to come back. The western markets are in for a
period of an extended difficult time or a  bear market . That may
not necessarily be true on a fundamental case for emerging
markets, but we live in a very global environment. So if you
have a western market, which is so depressed, then it’s very
unlikely that emerging markets will do well.”  On Indian corporate earnings:  “India is facing two headwinds,  interest rates  and raw
material costs. These have material impact on profits for any
company and the effects have started to be felt from January of
this year.”  On  Reserve Bank  of India rate increases:  “If on one hand you have a GDP growth rate, which is
slowing down, continuing interest rate hikes is a dilemma for
the RBI. The RBI isn’t going to ignore that fully. At the same
time, it will continue what it believes is a series of measures
to bring inflation down, which is a priority for RBI.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
