A European Union council crisis
summit on Oct. 23 must end uncertainty which has been great,
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said.  “ Europe  hasn’t been able to halt the crisis,” Papandreou
told his ruling PASOK party lawmakers in comments televised live
on state-run Vouli TV.  “The starting point for discussions is the July 21
decisions and we have to achieve the relieving of the debt
burden which is weighing on each Greek,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
