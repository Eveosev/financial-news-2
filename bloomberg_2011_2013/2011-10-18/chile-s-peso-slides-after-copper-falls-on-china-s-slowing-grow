Chile ’s peso weakened against the
dollar for a second day as copper dropped after growth in  China ,
the biggest buyer of the metal, slowed to a two-year low.  The peso slid 1.8 percent to 513.04 per  U.S. dollar  as of
11:22 a.m. in Santiago from 504.01 yesterday. The Bloomberg
JPMorgan Latin American Currency Index fell 0.2 percent today.  China’s economy  grew 9.1 percent in the third quarter from
a year earlier, the slowest since 2009 and less than the 9.3
percent median forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Copper accounts for more than half of Chile’s exports. China
bought 19 percent of the country’s second quarter exports.  “Copper fell yesterday and it’s falling today,” said
Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at EuroAmerica
Corredores de Bolsa in Santiago. “The market was waiting to see
how low the rally would reach and it reached lower than 500
pesos per dollar. The market is betting that this is a dollar
buying opportunity.”  There may be a technical ceiling at 518 and a floor at 505,
Cortes said. One-month non-deliverable peso forwards fell 1.2
percent to 512.43 per dollar.  Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
trimmed their net long dollar position to $5.5 billion on Oct.
14, the lowest since September, according to central bank data
published today.  Stocks weakened after Moody’s Investors Service said it may
lower  France ’s credit rating.  BNP Paribas SA closed a recommendation that investors buy
the Chilean peso and sell dollars after the currency appreciated
1.6 percent since it opened the trade on Oct. 6.  The French bank now suggests that Chile’s two-year swap
rate, at 4.20 percent, will rise closer to the five-year swap,
now 4.79 percent, according to an e-mailed note to clients. The
two contracts should trade almost at the same level, strategists
at the bank wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
