A group of 37 state and territorial
 attorneys general  urged the  U.S. Senate  to confirm  Richard Cordray  as the first director of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau.  “We believe he has the knowledge, experience and
leadership skills to serve in this important position,” the
group wrote today in a letter to senators released by the
National Association of Attorneys General. “He is both
brilliant and balanced.”  The group includes 25 Democratic attorneys general and
eight Republicans, according to Marjorie Tharp, a spokeswoman
for the association. Four have no party affiliation.  The Senate Banking Committee on Oct. 6 approved President
Barack Obama’s nomination of Cordray, a former attorney general
of Ohio. Forty-four Senate Republicans have vowed to oppose any
nominee without changes to the consumer agency’s structure and
funding. Confirmations generally require 60 votes in the 100-
member Senate.  Brian Deese, deputy director of Obama’s National Economic
Council, said in a conference call with reporters that the
endorsement of the attorneys general would “increase the
stakes” for Republicans who oppose the nomination. Deese also
ruled out changes to the structure of the agency, which was
created by the Dodd-Frank law of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
