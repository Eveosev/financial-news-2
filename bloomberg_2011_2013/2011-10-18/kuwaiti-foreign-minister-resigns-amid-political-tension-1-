The resignation of Kuwaiti Foreign
Minister Sheikh Mohammed Al-Sabah has been accepted, the state
news agency  KUNA  reported, citing government spokesman Ali al-
Rashed.  No reason was given for the resignation. Al-Rashed, who is
state minister for Cabinet affairs, told KUNA he was appointed
acting foreign minister.  Sheikh Mohammed’s resignation comes amid mounting political
tension between opposition lawmakers and the government, accused
by the former of corruption. The opposition has threatened to
question senior Cabinet members over an alleged corruption
scandal in which it claims lawmakers received unexplained
payments of millions of dinars to their bank accounts.  “I have previously said that if I don’t receive convincing
and detailed answers by Wednesday, I will reveal all documents
and papers to citizens” at a public rally on Oct. 19, Al-Rai
reported today, citing opposition lawmaker Musallam al-Barrak.
Al-Barrak was addressing the foreign minister, according to the
Kuwaiti newspaper.  Sheikh Mohammed couldn’t be reached for comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
