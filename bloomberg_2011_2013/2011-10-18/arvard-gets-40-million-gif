Harvard University  received a $40
million gift from Rita and Gustave Hauser to support innovations
in teaching and learning.  Harvard will use the funding for a grant program available
to university faculty, deans, administrators and students, and
to enhance classroom spaces to allow for new technologies and
experimental teaching methods, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-
based school said today in a  statement  on its website.  The gift is one of many to Harvard from the Hausers, who
both attended the university. Others include donations for the
construction of  Harvard Law School â€™s Hauser Hall in 1994, and
the founding of the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations,
at the Kennedy School in 1997.  Gustave Hauser served as chairman and chief executive
officer of Warner Cable Communications. Rita Hauser, a former
senior partner of law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, also
served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
