The  New York Jets  ended a three-game
losing streak with a 24-6 win against the  Miami Dolphins  that
was highlighted by  Darrelle Revis ’s 100-yard interception return
for a touchdown.  Mark Sanchez had a five-yard touchdown run and also threw a
38-yard scoring pass to Santonio Holmes for the Jets, who
improved to 3-3 with last night’s victory at MetLife Stadium in
East Rutherford,  New Jersey .  “It feels great. We came into this game very confident,”
Revis said in a televised interview. “We wanted to win one and
get back on track, especially at home.”  The Dolphins, who had won their previous three trips to the
Meadowlands, fell to 0-5 on the season. They’re one of three
winless National Football League teams, along with the 0-5 St.
Louis Rams and 0-6  Indianapolis Colts .  The Jets trailed 3-0 and hadn’t managed a first down on
their first two offensive possessions when Revis intercepted a
pass from Dolphins quarterback Matt Moore at the goal line and
raced 100 yards to give  New York  the lead for good. It matched
Aaron Glenn’s 100-yard touchdown against Miami in 1996 as the
longest interception return in team history.  “Brandon ran a great route, he kind of slipped on the play
and the ball was right there,” said Revis, who was covering
Dolphins receiver Brandon Marshall. “I caught it, saw daylight,
made a cutback and took it to the end zone.”  Revis finished with two interceptions of Moore, who was
making his first start for the Dolphins and completed 16 of 34
passes for 204 yards.  Sanchez Rushing Touchdown  After Miami pulled within 7-6, Sanchez ran for a touchdown
1:14 before halftime to cap an 81-yard drive. Following a 28-
yard field goal by  Nick Folk  with 4:15 left in the third
quarter, Holmes caught a short third-down pass from Sanchez and
broke to the outside for a touchdown that extended the Jets’
lead to 18 points.  The Jets, who were outgained 308-296 in total yardage, are
now 3-0 at home this season. They opened the season with back-
to-back wins at MetLife Stadium before losing road games at
Oakland, Baltimore and New England. The Jets will host the 4-1
 San Diego Chargers  on Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
