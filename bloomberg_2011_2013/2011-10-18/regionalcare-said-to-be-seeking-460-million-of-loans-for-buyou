RegionalCare Hospital Partners Inc.,
a provider of health-care services, is seeking $460 million of
loans to back its purchase of Essent Healthcare Inc., according
to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The financing for the Warburg Pincus LLC-owned company will
include a $295 million first-lien term loan B maturing in seven
years, a $100 million revolving line of credit expiring in five
years and a $65 million second-lien term piece due in 7 1/2
years, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the terms are private.  The first-lien term debt will have one-year soft-call
protection of 101 cents, meaning RegionalCare would have to pay
lenders 1 cent more than face value to refinance the debt during
the first year, the person said.  Citigroup Inc. is arranging the deal for the Brentwood,
Tennessee-based company and lenders must submit commitments by
Oct. 31 in  New York .  RegionalCare is buying Essent from Vesta Capital Partners
and Cressey & Co LP, according to a statement from its  website .  John Bakewell, Chief Financial Officer of RegionalCare,
declined to comment.  First-lien debt is repaid first in a bankruptcy or
liquidation, second-lien debt is repaid next. In a revolving
credit facility, money can be borrowed again once it’s repaid;
in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
