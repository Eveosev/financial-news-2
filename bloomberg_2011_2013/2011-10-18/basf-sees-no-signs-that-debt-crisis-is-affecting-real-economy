BASF SE (BAS)  board member Margret Suckale
said there are no signs that the debt crisis is affecting the
real economy.  A worsening of the debt crisis could hurt economic growth
in  Europe  and the U.S., Suckale said in an interview published
in the German companyâ€™s employee newspaper. BASF is following
the situation carefully and is well prepared, the manager said.  BASF is planning to hire 500 people this year at its
Ludwigshafen site, where the company is based, Suckale said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
