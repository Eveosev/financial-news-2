Russia may propose a global system
to guard against missile attacks and threats from space under
the control of the United Nations,  Kommersant  reported, citing
unnamed diplomats.  Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  is considering whether to
endorse the proposal put forward by Dmitry Rogozin, the
country’s envoy to the NATO security alliance, the Moscow-based
newspaper said.  Russia has criticized a proposed U.S.-led missile shield in
 Europe , saying it will blunt its nuclear capability, and
unsuccessfully sought legally binding guarantees the U.S. system
won’t target it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
