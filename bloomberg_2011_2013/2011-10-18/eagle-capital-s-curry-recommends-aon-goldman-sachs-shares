Eagle Capital Management LLC’s
Boykin Curry recommended buying shares of  Aon Corp. (AON)  and  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  as long-term investments. He spoke today at the
Value Investing Congress in New York.  Curry said Goldman Sachs could buy back 30 percent of its
shares, driving them to $172 within a few years. The shares rose
2.1 percent to $98.92 at 1:48 p.m. New York time as investors
looked past the company’s third-quarter loss and focused on
gains in trading revenue and prospects for a rebound in
underwriting and takeovers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
