Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the government was prepared for tough
negotiations with its European partners.  “Saving  Greece  means saving  Europe ,” Venizelos told
President Karolos Papoulias in a meeting in  Athens  today. There
is great uncertainty in Europe and the situation is “very
difficult”, he said.  Venizelos said Greece had to step up the fight against tax
evasion “which will help heal society’s wounds”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
