Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest
barley importer, is set to raise total grain purchases by 7
percent in the 2011-12 marketing year amid reduced production of
water-intensive crops, the  United Nations  said.  Cereal imports will climb to 12.16 million metric tons from
11.36 million tons in 2010-11, the UN’s  Food and Agriculture
Organization  forecast in a  report  on its website dated
yesterday.  Saudi Arabia decided in 2008 to gradually phase out all
water-intensive crops including wheat by 2016, after halting
subsidies to grow barley in 2003 to save water, according to the
Rome-based FAO.  The kingdom is forecast to import 2 million tons of wheat
in the 2011-12 year, the UN agency said. Imports of barley and
corn, mainly used for feed, are forecast at 6.7 million tons and
2.2 million tons respectively, according to the report.  Domestic wheat production is estimated to have dropped 13
percent to 1.1 million tons this year following adoption of the
2008 decree on crops, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
