The European debt crisis represents
a “dramatic barrier” to financing for clean-energy projects,
according to German state-owned lender KfW Group.  Access to long-term financing has become more difficult as
banks struggle to raise capital on the market, KfW Chief
Executive Officer  Ulrich Schroeder  said today at a conference in
Berlin.  “We need a healthy banking system” to fund large-scale
renewable energy projects such as offshore wind farms that take
years to develop and can cost in excess of 1 billion euros ($1.4
billion), he said.  KfW, named the world’s safest bank by Global Finance
magazine in August, last year provided 25.3 billion euros for
renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects worldwide,
Schroeder said. KfW intends to boost clean energy financing
“each year by 10 percent,” he said.  German turbine makers including Siemens AG and Nordex SE,
as well as producers of solar photovoltaic equipment such as Q-
Cells SE and Solarworld AG, have previously benefited from KfW
lending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
