Hospital operators such as  Community
Health Systems Inc. (CYH)  and  Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC)  would have to
meet fewer requirements to participate in Medicare under a cost-
cutting initiative the Obama administration announced.  The streamlined rules are designed to save $5 billion in
five years for hospitals that participate in the federal health
program for the elderly and disabled, said Health and Human
Services Secretary  Kathleen Sebelius  in a conference call today.  The reduction is part of a government review to reduce
outdated or excessive regulations on business announced this
year by President Barack Obama. Doctors will spend more time
treating patients rather than dealing with bureaucratic duties,
officials said.  “These changes will increase the amount of time
professionals will have to take care of patients,” said
Medicare Administrator Donald Berwick during the call.  Hospitals such as Community Health Systems, based in
Franklin,  Tennessee , and Dallas-based Tenet would have greater
flexibility to manage patient care under one proposal estimated
to save more than $900 million a year.  Critical-care hospitals would be permitted to contract out
lab work. All hospital operators could allow nurses and
physician assistants to perform more duties now restricted only
to doctors and to use a single governing body for facilities in
one system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
