A third person died in a South
African hospital after being found to be carrying a drug-
resistant bacteria, the South African Press Association
reported.  There are 10 confirmed cases of people infected or who are
carriers of New Delhi metallo-b-lactamase, which produces an
enzyme NDM-1 that makes it resistant to antibiotics, the
