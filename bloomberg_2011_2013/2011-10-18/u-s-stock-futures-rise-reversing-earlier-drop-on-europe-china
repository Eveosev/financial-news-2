U.S. stocks gained, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level since August,
as  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  paced a rally in financial shares and
optimism grew over progress on expanding  Europe ’s rescue fund.  Bank of America climbed 10 percent after it swung to a
profit as  credit quality  improved. A gauge of homebuilders in
S&P indexes jumped 9.6 percent, the most since March 2009, as
data showed that industry sentiment increased more than
forecast.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  added at least 3.9
percent, pacing gains among companies most-tied to the economy.
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  tumbled 5.9 percent after the close of regular
trading after profit and sales missed analysts’ expectations.  The S&P 500 added 2 percent to 1,225.38 at 4 p.m. New York
time, erasing yesterday’s drop. The benchmark gauge rose to the
highest level since Aug. 3, two days before S&P stripped the
U.S. of its AAA credit rating. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
gained 180.05 points, or 1.6 percent, to 11,577.05 today.  “We could be into one of those buying stampedes,”  Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist at Raymond James & Associates
in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida , said in a telephone interview. His
firm manages $300 billion. “It feels that the worst is in the
rear-view mirror. Housing is not going to be a thing that sucks
you down into a recession. Earnings are still going to look
pretty good. Something has to happen in Europe.”  The S&P 500 rose from the threshold of a  bear market  early
this month amid optimism over corporate earnings and steps by
European leaders to support banks. The rebound brought the gauge
close to the top of a price range between 1,074.77 and 1,230.71,
where it’s traded for more than two months. The S&P 500 briefly
rose above that range, reaching 1,233.10 today.  Earnings Estimates  Profit for  S&P 500  companies will climb 17 percent in the
third quarter and rise 18 percent to a record $99.76 for all of
2011, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
S&P 500 is trading for 11.1 times forecast earnings for 2012,
compared with its five-decade average of 16.4 times reported
income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Global stocks rallied. France and Germany are engaged in
“intensive talks” on bolstering the European Financial
Stability Facility, Steffen Seibert, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief spokesman, said today. He declined in an
interview to comment on a report in the Guardian that they
reached agreement on increasing the size of the fund, saying he
won’t comment on intermediate results of the negotiations.  In the U.S., data showed that homebuilders were less
pessimistic than forecast in October, as near record-low
borrowing costs and price decreases raised hopes the market will
turn for the better over the next six months.  Most-Tied  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
the economy added 3.3 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average advanced 3.1 percent. Alcoa gained 5.9 percent to
$10.14. Caterpillar climbed 3.9 percent to $84.72. PulteGroup
Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue, rallied 11
percent to $4.46.  “It’s reality beating investors’ poor expectations,”  Jack Ablin , who helps oversee $55 billion as chief investment officer
for Chicago-based Harris Private Bank, said in a telephone
interview. “That happens particularly with Bank of America,
given that everyone assumed for the worst. It’s not a matter of
if, it’s just a matter of when the industry recovers.”  The KBW Bank Index rallied 6.1 percent as all of its 24
stocks advanced. The gauge slumped 3.9 percent yesterday.  Bank of America  Bank of America rose 10 percent to $6.64. The provision for
loan losses dropped to $3.4 billion from $5.4 billion a year
earlier as credit improved in the card unit and commercial
lending, the bank said. The card unit swung to a profit in the
quarter, while income rose at the deposit unit, global wealth
and  investment management , and global commercial banking.  State Street Corp. (STT)  gained 11 percent to $37.49. The custody
bank under pressure from activist investor  Nelson Peltz  to
increase profitability said third-quarter profit rose a
stronger-than-expected 11 percent as custody assets increased.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added 5.5 percent to $102.25 even
after reporting its second quarterly loss in 12 years as the
firm lost money on investments and revenue declined from
trading, asset management and securities underwriting.  “It’s time to get less bearish,”  David Kelly , chief
market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “Investors ought to be able to look
forward and recognize that the economy does muddle through.
There’s a better underlying story for banks and also there’s
housing. There’s a realization that at some stage this thing is
going to turn.”  IBM Tumbles  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  tumbled 4.1 percent
to $178.90. The biggest computer-services company missed sales
estimates for the first time in five quarters. Revenue showed
slowing growth in IBM’s software, hardware and services
businesses.  Nasdaq-100 Index futures lost 0.9 percent to 2,342.50 at
5:05 p.m. after the close of regular trading. Apple retreated
5.9 percent to $397.15 as profit missed estimates as the company
sold fewer iPhones than analysts’ projected.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  also reported results after the market close.
The shares gained 4.4 percent to $24.43, after rising 0.5
percent in regular trading. The chipmaker forecast fourth-
quarter sales that exceeded some analysts’ estimates, citing
strong demand for laptop computers in emerging markets.  The S&P 500 may rise about 4 percent this week before the
gain ends, according to Tom DeMark, the creator of indicators
meant to identify turning points in the price of securities.  DeMark, whose prediction last month that the S&P 500’s
decline would stop at 1,076 proved prescient when the index
bottomed at 1,074.77, said the rally that lifted the benchmark
as much as 14 percent since then will fizzle. The S&P 500 will
rise as high as 1,254 before falling at least 5.6 percent, he
wrote in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
