EGAT Pcl,  Thailand ’s state-owned
power generator, said four of its plants stopped supplying
electricity to the national grid because of floods.  The four plants have a combined generating capacity of
1,210 megawatts, EGAT Governor Sutat Patamasiriwat said.  EGAT has purchased additional power from other plants,
ensuring that 18 percent of the nation’s overall capacity
remains in reserve, Sutat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
