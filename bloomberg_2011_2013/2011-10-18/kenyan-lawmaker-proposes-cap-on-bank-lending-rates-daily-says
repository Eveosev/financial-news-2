Kenyan lawmaker Martin Ogindo has
proposed to introduce a cap on commercial lending rates at 4
percent above the central bankâ€™s benchmark rate, to boost credit
growth, the  Daily Nation  said, citing draft legislation.  At least eight banks in the East African nation have raised
the cost of borrowing to as much as 20 percent, as the Central
Bank of Kenya increased its key lending rate to a record 11
percent this month, the Nairobi-based newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
