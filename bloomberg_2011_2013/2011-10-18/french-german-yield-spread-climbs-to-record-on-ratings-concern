France ’s 10-year bond yield climbed
to the highest compared with Germany’s in almost 20 years after
Moody’s Investors Service said the nation’s Aaa credit rating is
under pressure due to the regional debt crisis.  French securities also fell along with those from  Greece 
and Spain after reports showed  China ’s economic growth slowed
and German investor confidence worsened, fueling speculation the
global recovery is losing momentum. France’s financial strength
has waned because of the financial crisis, New York-based
Moody’s said yesterday. The euro-area’s second-largest economy
is a guarantor of the European Financial Stability Facility
regional bailout fund.  “If the EFSF is expanded, it would increase the contingent
liabilities for Aaa guarantor states like France and  Germany ,
which would be good for the periphery but not necessarily that
good for stronger euro countries,” said Elwin de Groot, senior
market economist at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht,  Netherlands .
“You can see the market’s concern in the spreads.”  France’s 10-year yield rose eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 3.14 percent at 4:51 p.m. London time. The
3.25 percent bond due October 2021 fell 0.705, or 7.05 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,367) face amount, to 100.960. The German bund
rate dropped eight basis points to 2.01 percent.  The difference between the two yields expanded by as much
as 18 basis points to 114 basis points today, the widest since
1992 based on Bloomberg generic prices.  Bunds Outperform  German bonds have returned 6.6 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. French debt gained 3.6 percent,
and Treasuries rose 8.1 percent. Italian bonds lost 3.7 percent,
even as the  European Central Bank  bought the securities.  China’s economic growth cooled to 9.1 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, the least since 2009, the
statistics bureau said today. The ZEW Center for European
Economic Research in Mannheim said its index of German investor
and analyst expectations declined to minus 48.3 from minus 43.3
in September. Economists expected a drop to minus 45, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  The euro weakened 0.1 percent to $1.3720, after falling 1
percent yesterday. The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index slid 0.4 percent.  Bunds extended their advance after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
reported a quarterly loss, only its second in 12 years as a
public company.  ‘More Cautious’  Investors bought the bonds of most higher-rated countries
as a refuge on signs the global economy is slowing and as they
await a European leaders’ summit on the debt crisis scheduled
for this weekend. Bunds rose yesterday as Germany moved to quell
speculation the Oct. 23 gathering will result in a complete
resolution to the debt crisis.  “Until we see what comes out of the meeting this coming
weekend, the market will remain on the more cautious side,”
said  Michael Markovic , a senior fixed-income strategist at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “The focus is also on the
economic numbers. In this environment we remain more
constructive on bunds.”  Finland ’s 10-year yield fell seven basis points to 2.49
percent, and similar-maturity Dutch rates dropped six basis
points to 2.44 percent.  Greece, Spain  Greek bonds led losses among the securities of Europe’s
most indebted nations, with the yield on its 4 percent note due
in August 2013 rising 161 basis points, or 1.61 percentage
points, to 76.42 percent, leaving the price at 38.61.  Greece sold 1.625 billion euros of 13-week Treasury bills
today with a uniform yield of 4.61 percent, according to the
Public Debt Management Agency in  Athens . Investors bid for 2.86
times the securities offered, the agency said.  Two-year yields in  Spain  rose 13 basis points to 3.88
percent and in  Italy  they climbed seven basis points to 4.45
percent. Irish two-year rates increased by 15 basis points to
7.83 percent.  The Spanish Treasury sold 3.56 billion of 12-month bills at
an average yield of 3.608 percent, compared with 3.591 percent
at an auction on Sept. 20. The country also sold 1.04 billion of
18-month debt at 3.801 percent.  Ireland may try to transfer part of the 62 billion-euro
cost of bailing out its banks to the euro-region’s rescue fund
should policy makers allow the facility to buy stakes directly
in lenders, three people with knowledge of the matter said.  Volatility on  Denmark ’s sovereign debt was among the highest
among developed markets today, according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two-10-year spreads and credit-default swaps. Swings on
Danish 10-year bonds were 1.4 times the 90-day average,
according to the Bloomberg gauge of developed markets. Denmark
isn't part of the euro area.  To contact the reporters on this story:
