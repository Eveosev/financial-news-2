Hungary ’s central bank is “quite
far” from raising the benchmark interest rate, Morgan Stanley
said.  “A rate hike seems quite far away and would only come
after a large increase in daily volatility and a steep move in
the forint, rather than when a given level is crossed” against
the euro, London-based economist Pasquale Diana said in an e-
mail today after meeting Hungarian officials on a trip to
central  Europe  between Oct. 10 and 12.  The central bank may act to prevent an “excessive
depreciation” of the forint, Diana said. An International
Monetary Fund credit line would be “appropriate” for Hungary,
even as there remain “high political obstacles” to resorting
to the IMF’s help, Morgan Stanley said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
