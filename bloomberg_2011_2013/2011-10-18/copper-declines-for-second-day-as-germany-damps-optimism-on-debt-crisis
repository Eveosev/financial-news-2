Copper fell for a second day as
 China’s economy  grew at the slowest pace in two years and
Germany doused expectations of a breakthrough in Europe’s debt
crisis at this weekend’s summit. All base metals declined.  Three-month copper on the  London  Metal Exchange dropped as
much as 3.1 percent to $7,261.25 a metric ton and traded at
$7,290 a ton at 3:51 p.m. Shanghai time. The December-delivery
contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange plunged 3.4 percent to
close at 54,000 yuan ($8,467) a ton.  China , the biggest user of the metal used in cables and
wires, grew 9.1 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier,
the slowest pace since 2009, on higher borrowing costs and
weaker exports. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s office knocked
down yesterday what it called “dreams” that an Oct. 23 summit
will resolve the crisis.  “Looking ahead, how Europe’s debt crisis will evolve will
decide copper-price direction,” said Xiao Wei, an analyst at
Industrial Futures Co.  China’s economy grew at less than the median estimate of
9.3 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 22 economists and
follows a 9.5 percent gain in the previous three months.  “I think it was Goldilocks data - not too hot, not too
cold. Can’t see the People’s Bank of China changing monetary
policy on the basis of this data,” said  David Thurtell , head of
metals research at Citigroup Inc. in  Singapore .  September output of refined copper in China retreated to
479,000 tons from a record 518,000 tons in August, the nation’s
National Bureau of Statistics said today. Aluminum production
dropped to 1.52 million tons from 1.55 million tons a month ago.  In London, aluminum fell 0.7 percent to $2,200.25 a ton,
zinc tumbled 2.5 percent to $1,858 a ton and lead lost 2.1
percent to $1,944 a ton. Nickel retreated 2 percent to $18,603 a
ton and tin dropped 2.4 percent to $20,985 a ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
