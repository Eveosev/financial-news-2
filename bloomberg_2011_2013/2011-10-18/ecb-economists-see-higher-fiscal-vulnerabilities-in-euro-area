Euro-region governments increased
their debt load as a result of the financial crisis, making the
bloc more vulnerable, European Central Bank economists said.  “Overall, fiscal vulnerabilities in the euro area have
increased,” economists Dagmar Hartwig Lojsch, Marta Rodriguez-
Vives and Michal Slavik wrote in a  research paper  called “The
size and composition of government debt in the euro area,”
published on the Frankfurt-based ECB’s website today.  Governments across the 17-member euro region have struggled
to stabilize banking systems and bolster economic growth during
the global financial crisis and following recession. While the
region returned to growth, leaders are still seeking ways to
contain the debt crisis that pushed  Greece  to the brink of
default and eroded investor confidence.  While international comparisons show that the U.S. and
 Japan  “are no better off,” increasing “government-debt
ratios” in the euro region “need to be stabilized and put on a
sustainable path which ensures market confidence,” the
economists said in their report.  The key risks for the euro area are stemming from “both
the higher levels of explicit and off-balance-sheet debt and
from the composition of debt reliant on short-term financing and
foreign holders,” the economists said.  The ECB said the views expressed in the paper are those of
the authors and “do not necessarily reflect those of the ECB.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
