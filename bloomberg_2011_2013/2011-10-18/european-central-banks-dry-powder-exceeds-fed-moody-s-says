Europe ’s central banks have more
“dry powder” to buy assets and support lenders in the region
than their British and U.S. counterparts, Moody’s Investors
Service said.  Were national central banks and the  European Central Bank 
to expand their 2.2 trillion-euro ($3 trillion) balance sheet by
1.5 trillion euros to cover all sovereign and bank bond
maturities from 2011 to 2013, the percentage increase since June
2007 would be less than for the Federal Reserve Bank, Moody’s
said in a note to clients today.  “However, the Eurosystem’s balance sheet would grow very
large under this theoretical scenario, to approximately 40
percent of euro area” gross domestic product, the note said.  Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20
economies that met last weekend have urged the region’s leaders
to deal “decisively” and develop a plan to prevent a Greek
default and bolster banks when they meet for emergency talks on
Oct. 23 in Brussels.  The ECB, though, is likely to “limit actions that could be
seen as akin to direct financing of government deficits,”
restricted under its statute, the note said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
