BSI SA, the Swiss private bank owned
by  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) , may expand its Hong Kong office
by as many as 54 people in the next year as rising wealth in
Asia intensifies competition for staff.  The bank may boost headcount to as many as 120 people from
the current 66, Hanspeter Brunner, chief executive officer of
BSI Asia, said today at a news conference in the city.  Asia-Pacific millionaires outnumbered those in  Europe  for
the first time last year, according to a survey by CapGemini SA
and Bank of America Corp. Demand for client relationship
managers in the region is predicted to jump 26 percent over 2011
and 2012 -- double the rate forecast for the same period
globally, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  The plan is “subject to the availability of good-quality
people,” Brunner said, predicting that profit margins will be
squeezed further as competition for staff raises salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
