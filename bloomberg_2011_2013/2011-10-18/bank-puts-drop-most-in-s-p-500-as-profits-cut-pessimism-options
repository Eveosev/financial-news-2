The cost of options protecting
against losses in financial companies is falling faster than any
other industry as earnings reassure investors that banks and
brokerages will avoid a repeat of 2008.  Three-month puts on the  Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) 
cost 10.15 points more than calls, according to Bloomberg data
on implied volatility. The price relationship known as skew has
narrowed 16 percent since Oct. 3, the most among nine ETFs
tracking Standard & Poor’s 500 Index industries, as the gauge
jumped 11 percent.  Results from  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  are reducing pessimism after concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis would spread sent price-to-book ratios on
financial companies to the lowest level since April 2009. Bank
shares have gained 14 percent since Oct. 3 after falling 31
percent since the S&P 500’s April 29 peak, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “A great deal of pessimism is baked into bank-stock
valuations,” Brian Barish, Denver-based president of Cambiar
Investors LLC, which oversees about $8 billion, wrote in an e-
mail yesterday. “Perhaps less volatility baked into the
valuations is appropriate.”  About $170 billion has been restored to financial stocks in
the  S&P 500  since Oct. 3 on speculation Europe will find a
solution to its debt crisis. The Financial ETF climbed 4.8
percent yesterday to $12.79, while the S&P 500 increased 2
percent to a two-month high of 1,225.38.  Beating Estimates  The 10 financial companies that have reported results so
far this season have exceeded the average analyst estimate by 14
percent, with Citigroup in New York and  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based Bank of America beating them the most.  The industry trades for 0.9 times book value, or assets
minus liabilities. That’s near the 0.8 level from Oct. 3, which
was the lowest since April 2009. More than $2 trillion of global
losses and writedowns related to subprime mortgages sent
financial companies in the S&P 500 down 57 percent in 2008.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, for
the financial ETF’s at-the-money options expiring in three
months fell 30 percent since its Oct. 4 high to 39.18 yesterday.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, declined 31 percent from its Oct. 3 peak to
31.56 yesterday. The volatility gauge remains above its 21-year
average of 20.49. Europe’s VStoxx Index, which measures the cost
of Euro Stoxx 50 Index contracts, fell 18 percent to 39.67. The
VIX rose 9.1 percent to 34.44 today, while the VStoxx gained 0.6
percent to 39.89.  Morgan Stanley (MS)   Among all financial companies in the S&P 500, Morgan
Stanley had the biggest decline in implied volatility, dropping
45 percent from Oct. 4 to 64.01 yesterday. The New York-based
company, which fell to its lowest level since December 2008 on
Oct. 3, has rebounded 33 percent since.  Citigroup three-month options 10 percent below the current
stock price cost 18 percent more than calls 10 percent above it.
The change in the price relationship dropped from its 44 percent
high on Oct. 3 for the biggest decline among all S&P 500
financial companies. It reached an 83 percent premium in April
2007, a record, Bloomberg data show. Shares of the New York-
based company rallied 29 percent from a 30-month low on Oct. 3.  “What we’ve seen with this rally is the fear being taken
out of the market,” Justin Wiggs, who trades financial stocks
at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said in a telephone
interview. Earnings “weren’t as bad as some people had
feared,” he said.  Talks in Paris  Officials from the Group of 20 nations concluded weekend
talks in Paris by endorsing parts of Europe’s emerging plan to
avoid a Greek default, bolster banks and curb contagion, setting
an Oct. 23 deadline. Steffen Seibert, German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s spokesman, said “dreams” of an imminent resolution
aren’t likely, and Merkel and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
pledged to deliver a plan by Nov. 3.  Banks aren’t luring  Malcolm Polley , who oversees $1.1
billion as chief investment officer at Stewart Capital in
 Indiana ,  Pennsylvania . The  Federal Reserve ’s decision to leave
rates near zero until at least mid-2013 to combat stalling
economic growth means banks can’t make as much from lending, he
said. The firm’s sole bank holdings are San Francisco-based
 Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and Warren, Pennsylvania-based  Northwest
Bancshares Inc. (NWBI)   “I’m a value investor, and the downside to that is you buy
things cheap, but sometimes things are cheap for a reason,”
Polley said in a telephone interview yesterday. The financial
industry is “a lousy business to be in right now,” he said.
“Earnings are going to be under pressure for a long time.”  S&P 500 Earnings  Analysts estimate that S&P 500 earnings in the third
quarter totaled $25.05 a share, up from a forecast of $24.60 on
Sept. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price-
earnings ratio for the entire financial industry in the S&P 500
fell to 9.6 on Oct. 3, the lowest in Bloomberg data going back
to 1993.  “Financials haven’t done well recently, and valuations are
coming to a good level -- they’re becoming more attractive,”
 Giri Cherukuri , head trader for Oakbrook Investments, which
manages $2.7 billion in Lisle,  Illinois , said in a telephone
interview yesterday. “Earnings reports are coming out now, so
we’re getting some clarity about the financial position of all
these companies.”  Seven of the 10 contracts on the financial ETF with the
biggest increase in open interest over the past two weeks were
bullish. January $15 calls rose by 104,191 to 213,259, while
October $13 calls gained 94,408 to 374,521.  “People were protecting against cataclysmic losses,” Alec Levine, an equity derivatives strategist Newedge Group SA in  New
York , said in a telephone interview yesterday. “The worst-case
scenario was more than priced in -- now that we’re past the
earnings events people are taking their protection off.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
