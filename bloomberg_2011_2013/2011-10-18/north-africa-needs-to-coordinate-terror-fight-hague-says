Countries in North Africa need to
work together to combat a rising risk of terrorism in the
region, said  William Hague , the U.K. foreign secretary, during
a visit to Nouakchott, Mauritania’s capital.  The nations “have to coordinate their fight against
terrorist threats after the Libyan crisis” that increases the
possibility of weapons being accessed by the groups, he told
reporters in the city today.  Hague praised Mauritania’s fight against al-Qaeda in the
Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, the terror organization’s North
African branch.  The conflict in  Libya , which saw the ouster of leader
Muammar Qaddafi by rebel forces, may undermine peace and
security in the region and spur the proliferation of weapons,
an African Union committee on the crisis said Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
