OAO Gazprom seeks to sell natural
gas to  China  at market terms and refuses “to subsidize” its
neighbor, Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Officer Alexander Medvedev said in the company’s newsletter today.  “We believe that a country with the largest foreign
currency reserves can and should buy gas on the same principal
terms as China’s neighbors in the region,” Medvedev said in an
e-mailed newsletter. “There is no reason for any of the
exporters to subsidize the Chinese economy.”  Gazprom and China National Petroleum Corp. were scheduled
to agree on contractual terms by the middle of the year but
failed to do so on price disagreements, Medvedev said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
