U.K. stocks declined for a second
day after data showed  China’s economy  grew at the slowest pace
in two years, adding to concern that Europe’s debt crisis is
dragging on the global recovery.  Rio Tinto  Group and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  lost at least 3.5
percent as copper retreated in London.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) 
dropped 2.7 percent after Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd.
sold $513 million of exchangeable bonds.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  slid 26.35, or 0.5 percent, to 5,410.35
at the close in London after falling by the same extent
yesterday. The FTSE All-Share Index also lost 0.5 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 0.6 percent in Dublin.  “London’s collection of major mining stocks has been under
pressure from the start today, providing another drag for the
FTSE,” said London-based Yusuf Heusen, a sales trader at IG
Index in London. “For now the short-term bears have the upper
hand in stock markets.”  Stocks fell yesterday after  Germany  dashed investor
optimism that the euro area leaders will find a quick resolution
to the region’s debt crisis when they meet at an Oct. 23 summit
in Brussels. The FTSE 100 had risen for three straight weeks
amid optimism policy makers will find a solution to the crisis
that has Greece on the edge of a default.  Mining Shares  Commodity producers declined today after the economy in
 China , the world’s biggest consumer of the copper, expanded 9.1
percent in the third quarter, the slowest pace since 2009.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange plunged as much
as 3.7 percent to $7,215 a metric ton.  Rio Tinto dropped 4.3 percent to 3,159.5 pence. Vedanta
slipped 3.5 percent to 1,164 pence.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  fell 0.8
percent to 1,894 pence and  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , which reported a 4
percent drop in copper output for the third-quarter, lost 1.3
percent to 936.5 pence.  BHP and Rio also fell after China’s Economic Information
Daily reported that Vale SA has decided to cut iron ore prices
to $160 per ton from $175 per ton, according to an unidentified
official from a Chinese steelmaker. Rio and BHP may respond
“soon” to similar requests, the newspaper said.  Standard Chartered  dropped 2.7 percent to 1,390 pence after
Temasek sold S$650 million ($513 million) of bonds maturing in
2014 that are exchangeable into the U.K. lender’s shares.
Bondholders will be allowed to swap the zero-coupon securities
into stock at a par value of 50 cents each.  The notes can be exchanged at a 27 percent premium over
Standard’s closing share price of 1,357 pence yesterday.  William Hill, BSkyB  William Hill Plc (WMH)  dropped 5.3 percent to 228.8 pence after
analysts downgraded the U.K. bookmaker. Deutsche Bank AG lowered
its recommendation to “hold,” while Numis Securities cut its
rating to “reduce.”  G4S Plc (GFS)  paced advancing shares, rising 9.8 percent to 241.5
pence. The shares slumped 22 percent yesterday after the company
announced a 2 billion-pound ($3.2 billion) rights offer to help
acquire ISS A/S.  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc climbed 1.6 percent to
675.5 pence before the U.K.’s biggest pay-TV operator reports
earnings tomorrow.  Bellway Plc (BWY)  advanced 3.1 percent to 698.5 pence after the
homebuilder reported a 51 percent jump in annual profit to 50.1
million pounds). That beat the average analyst estimate of 48.3
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
