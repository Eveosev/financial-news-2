Crude oil rose to the highest level
in more than one month as U.S. stocks rallied after  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  reported better-than-estimated results, raising
hopes that economic growth will stabilize.  Oil climbed 2.3 percent as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rose after Bank of America, this year’s worst performer in the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average , reported a third-quarter profit
versus a loss a year earlier. Crude fell as much as 1 percent
earlier as data showed  China’s economy  grew at the slowest pace
in two years.  “The correlation between oil and equities has risen
considerably since the first half of the year,” said  Chris Barber , a senior analyst at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “You’re seeing traders conduct a
risk-on, risk-off strategy. When there is good news, there’s an
appetite for risk and you see oil and stocks gain.”  Crude for November delivery rose $1.96 to $88.34 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
price since Sept. 15.  Brent oil for December settlement rose 99 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $111.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The spread between the December Brent and Nymex
crude contracts narrowed to $22.62 from a record high of $27.88
on Oct. 14.  Prices were little changed from the settlement as the
 American Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S.
crude-oil stockpiles fell 3.13 million barrels to 337.3 million.
December oil was up $1.86, or 2.2 percent, to $88.24 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:33 p.m.  Libya Output  Nymex oil and Brent “are coming closer as Libya comes back
online,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a Chicago-based senior market
strategist at MF Global.  Libya ’s largest oil refinery at Ras
Lanuf will be ready to start operations next month, Libyan
Emirates Refining Co. said yesterday.  The plant, which can process 220,000 barrels a day of
crude, was shut in March because of fighting between forces
loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  and rebels seeking the former leader’s
ouster.  The country’s output fell to 45,000 barrels a day in
August, according to Bloomberg estimates. The North African
nation pumped 100,000 barrels a day last month.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 2 percent to
1,225.38 after dropping as much as 0.8 percent. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 1.6 percent to 11,577.05. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials increased 0.7 percent to
637.22.  Bank of America  Bank of America swung to a third-quarter profit on higher
revenue, better  credit quality  and one-time gains. Shares jumped
as much as 7.6 percent in  New York  trading.  “We continue to track the equity market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford,  Connecticut . “The question is how the  U.S. economy  is
going to play out in the next few months.”  Homebuilders in the U.S. were less pessimistic than
forecast in October as near record-low borrowing costs and price
decreases raised hopes the market will improve.  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
sentiment index climbed to 18, the highest level since May 2010,
from 14 in the prior month, data from the Washington-based group
showed today.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected the measure
would rise to 15, according to the median forecast. Readings
below 50 mean more respondents said conditions were poor.  Chinese Growth  China ’s gross domestic product grew 9.1 percent in the
third quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace since 2009,
the country’s statistics bureau said today.  The growth rate was less than the median estimate of 9.3
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 22 economists and followed
a 9.5 percent increase in the previous three months. The country
is the biggest oil consumer after the U.S.  Apparent oil demand in China, or the amount of processing
volume plus net imports, increased 2.8 percent to 8.949 million
barrels a day in September compared with a year earlier. That’s
down from 7.97 percent year-on-year growth in August, based on
Bloomberg data.  “All oil traders have their eyes glued to China but we are
also earnings-focused,” said Ilczyszyn.  An Energy Department report tomorrow may show U.S. crude
inventories climbed for a second week, according to a Bloomberg
News survey.  Stockpiles of crude oil increased by 2 million barrels, or
0.6 percent, to 339.6 million in the seven days ended Oct. 14,
according to the median of 13 analyst estimates in the Bloomberg
survey before a weekly Energy Department report tomorrow.  Gasoline supplies dropped 1.5 million barrels to 208.1
million last week, the survey showed.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 614,320
contracts as of 4:33 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 535,799
contracts yesterday, 20 percent below the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.43 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
