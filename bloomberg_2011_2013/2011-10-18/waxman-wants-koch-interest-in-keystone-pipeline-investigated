Democratic Representative Henry
Waxman called on Republicans to investigate Koch Industries
Inc.’s denials that it has a financial stake in  TransCanada
Corp. (TRP) ’s proposed Keystone XL pipeline.  Waxman of California, the top Democrat on the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, today wrote committee Chairman  Fred
Upton , a Michigan Republican, and Representative Ed Whitfield of
Kentucky, who leads the energy and power subcommittee, renewing
a previous request that the panel examine Koch’s role. The
pipeline, opposed by environmental groups, is under review by
the U.S. State Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
