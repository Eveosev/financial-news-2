Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government should lower the solidarity surcharge on income and
corporate tax to show it can act, Jan Muecke, a member on the
board of Merkel’s Free Democratic Party coalition partner, told
Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper.  The surcharge, which reaped 11.7 billion euros ($16.4
billion) last year, can be cut without requiring approval in the
opposition-controlled upper house of parliament, said Muecke,
who’s also deputy transport minister.  The FDP in the eastern half of Germany has announced it
will file a motion to cut the surcharge should the government,
led by Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union , fail to act soon, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
