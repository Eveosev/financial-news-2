The Philippine Supreme Court ordered
banks to place tax payment on so-called PEACe bonds in an
escrow, spokesman Midas Marquez said today in  Manila .  The high court didnâ€™t issue a restraining order sought by
Philippine banks, Marquez said. Eight local lenders
yesterday asked the court to stop the government from imposing
and collecting a 20 percent tax on interest income from 35
billion pesos worth of bonds due today. The government expects
to collect almost 5 billion pesos in taxes from the bonds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
