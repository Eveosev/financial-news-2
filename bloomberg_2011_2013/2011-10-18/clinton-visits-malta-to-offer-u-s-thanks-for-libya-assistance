U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary
Clinton  arrived in  Malta  to thank Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi
for the country’s help during the campaign to oust Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi , including evacuating American citizens from the
North African country.  Clinton said she urged support for  Libya ’s transition to
democracy and discussed nuclear and human trafficking in the
Mediterranean region. Other subjects discussed include the
enforcement of sanctions against  Iran , she told reporters today.  “The U.S. appreciates Malta’s leadership in this area,
including its work to seize prohibited Iranian cargo and to deny
port access to ships that are bearing illegal cargoes,” Clinton
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
