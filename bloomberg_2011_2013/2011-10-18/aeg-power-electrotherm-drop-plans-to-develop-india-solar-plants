AEG Power Solutions Group, a  unit
of Netherlands-based 3W Power SA, has dropped plans to set up
solar-powered plants with  Electrotherm India Ltd. (ELT)  in the South
Asian nation.  The two companies terminated their agreement to jointly
develop plants, AEG Power spokeswoman Claire Pairault said in an
e-mail yesterday. Electrotherm didn’t respond to three e-mails
requesting comment. In October 2010, the companies announced
plans for at least 100 megawatts of capacity.  AEG Power has won contracts to develop about 40 megawatts
of capacity in India in six months, Pairault said. Those deals,
in addition to production capacity from its Bangalore plant,
“allow us to go directly to potential customers,” she said.  Projects have been delayed by difficulties in raising
funds, which is leading to cost escalation, AEG Power Chief
Executive Officer Horst Kayser told the Economic Times in a
interview published yesterday.  India ’s federal government awarded permits to build 620
megawatts of solar plants in December 2010 in its first national
auction. The first 150 megawatts of these are due to be
completed by about January.  AEG Power is a unit of Netherlands-based 3W Power SA,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
