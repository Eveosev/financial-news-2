The U.S. isn’t prepared to respond
to a pandemic or large biological attack, federal officials
said.  “We’re not ready for a global catastrophe involving” a
pathogen, Tara O’Toole, undersecretary for science and
technology at the Department of  Homeland Security , said today at
a Senate Homeland Security committee hearing.  Vahid Majidi, an assistant director at the  Federal Bureau
of Investigation , said the U.S. would struggle to respond to a
pandemic.  The views reflect the conclusion of a bipartisan report
released last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
