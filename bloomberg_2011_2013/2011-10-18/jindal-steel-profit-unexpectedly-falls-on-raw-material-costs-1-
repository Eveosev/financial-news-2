Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP) ,  India ’s
biggest producer of the alloy by market value, reported an
unexpected decline in second-quarter group profit because of
higher raw material costs and a one-time expense.  Net income fell to 8.75 billion rupees ($178 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30 from 8.82 billion rupees a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement to the  Bombay
Stock Exchange . The median of seven analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg was 9.1 billion rupee. Sales rose 43 percent to
44.1 billion rupees.  Coking coal surged 40 percent to $315 a metric ton in the
last quarter after record rains in Queensland state in December
disrupted supplies from  Australia , the largest exporter of the
commodity. Steel prices also remained stagnant in the three-
month period as demand slowed following the Indian central
bank’s Sept. 16 decision to increase  interest rates  for the 12th
time since March 2010.  Total expenses, including raw material costs, for the
quarter jumped 65 percent to 30.5 billion rupees, the company
said. Costs included a one-time expense of 741.7 million rupees,
the company said, without giving details.  The stock fell 1.4 percent to 515.45 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The key Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock
Exchange fell 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporters for this story:
