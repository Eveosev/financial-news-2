Asia  doesn’t need a “dramatic
shift” in monetary policy to counter global growth risks
because the region’s expansion is robust and inflation pressures
remain, Asian Development Bank Managing Director Rajat Nag said.  A worsening European debt crisis will affect Asian
economies and central banks should look at the conditions in
their own countries when deciding on monetary policy, Nag said
in an interview in Singapore today. The volatility of capital
flows is also a concern, he said.  “The delicate balancing act is between growth and
inflation but inflation still remains a concern in Asia,” Nag
said. “The countries in Asia do not need to have any dramatic
shift because many countries including  China  and  India  have been
tightening their monetary policy for quite some time in response
to inflationary pressures.”  China can achieve a “soft landing,” Nag said, adding that
the Manila-based lender is not too worried about unsustainable
growth in the world’s most populous nation.  China’s economy  grew
9.1 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the
slowest pace since 2009.  “Growth in Asia is going to still be fairly robust unless
the euro crisis gets out of hand and then we’ll have to revisit
the whole issue,” he said.  Asia’s expansion remains uneven and the region cannot
depend on export-led growth, Noeleen Heyzer, executive secretary
of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific, said in  Singapore  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
