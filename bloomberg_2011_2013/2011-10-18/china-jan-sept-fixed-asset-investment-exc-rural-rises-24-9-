China â€™s fixed-asset investment
excluding rural households climbed 24.9 percent in the first
nine months of the year from a year earlier, the National Bureau
of Statistics said on its website today. That compared with the
24.8 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 19
economists and a 25 percent gain in the first eight months of
the year.  In real terms, investment rose 16.9 percent in the first
nine months, the bureau said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
