Investors may seek to buy the euro
against the yen as a momentum gauge signals the 17-nation
currency has dropped at a pace fast enough to encourage a
rebound, according to Shinsei Bank Ltd.  The weekly and monthly stochastic oscillators are below 30,
the threshold that suggests to some traders an asset’s price has
fallen too quickly and is poised to reverse course, said Takako Masai, general manager of the markets sub-group at Shinsei Bank.  “It’s natural the euro faces a correctional slide after a
bounce from below 101 yen,” Tokyo-based Masai said. “The currency 
has been oversold over the long term, so the euro should find 
buyers on dips.”  The euro rose 0.2 percent to 105.71 yen as of 9:19 a.m. in
 Tokyo . The common currency strengthened to as high as 107.68 yen
yesterday on optimism European policy makers are speeding up
efforts to contain the region’s debt crisis. It had touched
100.76 yen on Oct. 4, the lowest level since June 2001.  The euro needs to breach the 109-yen level, where its 90-
day moving average stands, to reverse the long-term downward
trend, Masai also predicts.  A stochastic oscillator chart measures the closing price of
a security relative to its highs and lows during a period to try
to predict its direction.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
