Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ’s Vertu luxury handset
unit will launch its first touchscreen model, the 4,400-euro
($6,058) Constellation, in Milan today.  “It’s not different from any other luxury category, so for
someone who appreciates beauty and durable materials,” Vertu
President Perry Oosting said in a Bloomberg Television interview
today. The “maturity” of Nokia’s Symbian software and the
services such as concierge assistance and private club access
that come with the phone are also part of the offering, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
