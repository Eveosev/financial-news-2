Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  and Sanofi
won an appeals court ruling that upholds a $442 million patent-
infringement judgment against Apotex Inc. related to generic
copies of the blood thinner Plavix.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington declined to make Apotex pay an additional $107.9
million in interest, according to the  decision  today on the
court’s website. The court also rejected Apotex’s argument that
a trial judge should have let the generic-drug maker pursue
additional claims to challenge the 2007 infringement finding.  Plavix, sold by New York-based Bristol-Myers in the U.S.
and Paris-based Sanofi elsewhere, is the second-biggest selling
medicine, behind  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Lipitor. Apotex began selling a
generic version in 2006 after a lawsuit settlement agreement
fell apart. The Toronto-based company was ordered by a judge to
halt sales, and later lost a court challenge to the main patent
on the drug, which has a chemical name of clopidogrel bisulfate.  The agreement capped the amount closely held Apotex would
have to pay to no more than 50 percent of sales of the generic
version. The Federal Circuit said that the agreement didn’t
allow the court to also order prejudgment interest on the award.  About 34 percent of Bristol-Myers’s $19.5 billion in
revenue last year came from Plavix. The drug has generic
challengers in  Europe  and will have competition in the U.S. in
May 2012.  The case is Sanofi-Aventis v. Apotex Inc., 2011-1048, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower
case is Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex Inc., 02cv2255, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
