Hungarian central bank President
Andras Simor said his personal finances are transparent and he
no longer has ownership in a Cyprus-based company.  Parliament’s budget commmittee has no jurisdiction to probe
his personal finances, Simor added at the committee’s hearing
today in Budapest.  The budget committee should ask Simor to present proof that
he has repatriated savings from Cyprus,  Peter Szijjarto , Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban ’s spokesman and a member of the committee,
said earlier today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
