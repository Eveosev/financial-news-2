Malaysia ’s ringgit fell the most in
more than three weeks on concern exports will slow as  China ’s
economy cools and  Europe  struggles to contain a debt crisis.  Asia’s biggest economy grew 9.1 percent last quarter from a
year earlier, the smallest gain in two years, according to
official figures released in Beijing today. China is Malaysia’s
biggest export market. The ringgit weakened for the first time
in three days after  Germany  said the time needed to resolve the
euro region’s credit issues will extend into 2012.  “There’s been a setback in terms of the risk environment,
mainly due to comments by Germany that dampen expectations of a
grand plan,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at Bank
of Singapore Ltd. “What’s important today is China’s GDP.”  The ringgit dropped 0.9 percent to 3.1359 per dollar as of
4:01 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency was down 0.3 percent before China
released today’s data. The currency has advanced 1.9 percent so
far this month, after slumping 7 percent in September, the
biggest loss since June 1998.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office knocked down
yesterday what it called “dreams” that an Oct. 23 summit of
European leaders will be the last word in taming the crisis. The
search for an end to the problem “surely extends well into next
year,” Merkel’s spokesmen Steffen Seibert said.  Malaysia’s government bonds were unchanged. The yield on
the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016 held at 3.38 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
