Mortgage defaults in  California  rose
26 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months
as lenders began working through a backlog of delinquent loans
after a nationwide delay, according to  DataQuick .  First-time notices of default totaled 71,275, up from
56,633 in the second quarter, the San Diego-based data firm said
today in a report. Default notices are the beginning of the
foreclosure process in California, the most populous U.S. state.  “The way it looks right now, it’s reasonable to expect
default filings to run at a somewhat higher level than we saw
earlier this year,” DataQuick President  John Walsh  said in the
statement. “Some lenders and loan servicers have begun to plow
through their backlogs of delinquent loans more aggressively.”  Banks across the U.S. delayed foreclosure actions a year
ago after claims of improper processing of paperwork, known as
“robo-signing,” led to a legal probe by all 50 state attorneys
general and settlement talks that are ongoing. California
Attorney General Kamala Harris said Sept. 30 the state had
pulled out of the negotiations and wouldn’t be part of a
national accord.  California’s default notices fell 14 percent from the third
quarter of 2010, before most of the delays began, according to
DataQuick.  Areas in California with median sales prices of less than
$200,000 this year had 11 default notices per 1,000 homes during
the third quarter. The statewide average was 8.1 notices per
1,000 homes. Areas with medians above $800,000 had 2.8 notices
per 1,000 homes, according to DataQuick.  To contact the reporter on this story:
