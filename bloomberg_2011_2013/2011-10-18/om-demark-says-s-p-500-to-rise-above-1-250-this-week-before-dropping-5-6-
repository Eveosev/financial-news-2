The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
advance about 4 percent this week before the gain ends,
according to Tom DeMark, the creator of indicators meant to
identify turning points in the price of securities.  DeMark, whose prediction last month that the  S&P 500 ’s
decline would stop at 1,076 proved prescient when the index
bottomed at 1,074.77, said the rally that lifted the benchmark
as much as 14 percent since then will fizzle. The S&P 500 will
rise as high as 1,254 before falling at least 5.6 percent, he
wrote in an e-mail today.  “This rally should squeeze short sellers and exhaust late
buying,” said DeMark, the founder of Market Studies LLC. “The
rally should be fast.”  The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities jumped 11 percent in
the nine days ended Oct. 14, the biggest advance since March
2009, on optimism over corporate earnings and steps by European
leaders to support banks. The rebound brought the gauge close to
the top of a  price range  between 1,074.77 and 1,230.71, where
it’s traded for more than two months. The index gained 0.8
percent to 1,210.74 at 11:44 a.m. New York time.  The S&P 500 would produce a sell signal today by closing
above its Oct. 12 close of 1,207.25, marking the ninth
consecutive day that the benchmark exceeded its final price four
days earlier, DeMark said. A close above a two-month high of
1,224.58 reached on Oct. 14 would “perfect” the sell setup,
according to DeMark, who has spent more than 40 years developing
indicators with names like “sequential” and “countdown.”  The model calls for “one day of grace” should the index
fail today to surpass its close four days ago. In that case,
should tomorrow’s open exceed the Oct. 12 close, it would
suffice for the sell setup, DeMark said.  DeMark, an adviser to  Steven A. Cohen ’s SAC Capital
Advisors LP, provided consulting to hedge funds including  George Soros ’s Soros Fund Management LLC and  Leon Cooperman ’s Omega
Advisors Inc. Advisors Inc. He said during an interview on Aug.
16 that some European banks are “bottoming right now” and
companies such as Societe Generale SA, BNP Paribas SA, UBS AG
and Credit Agricole SA “look like buys.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
