There is “no evidence” that
inflation pressures in  South Africa  are becoming entrenched,
South African Reserve Bank Deputy Governor  Daniel Mminele  said.  While recent supply shocks have put upward pressure on
inflation, price expectations aren’t becoming “less anchored,”
Mminele said, according to the copy of a  speech  in  Cape Town 
today, published in the central bank’s website.  Policy makers in Africa’s biggest economy, led by Governor
Gill Marcus, kept the benchmark lending rate at a 30-year low of
5.5 percent last month as they struggle to support domestic
economic growth, while keeping price increases in check.  The risks to the country’s growth outlook are on the
downside as job cuts weigh on  consumer spending  and a weaker
global economy undermines production, while the depreciation of
the rand “brought to the fore the potential upside risk” to
inflation, Mminele said.  The currency plunged 14 percent against the dollar last
month, the most in almost three years and the second-worst
performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
The rand dropped 1.1 percent to 8.0498 per  U.S. dollar  at 12:27
p.m. today.  The inflation rate will probably breach the top end of the
central bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target in the fourth
quarter before returning to the target in the second three
months of next year, Mminele said. Consumer prices increased 5.3
percent in August from a year earlier, according to the
country’s statistics agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
