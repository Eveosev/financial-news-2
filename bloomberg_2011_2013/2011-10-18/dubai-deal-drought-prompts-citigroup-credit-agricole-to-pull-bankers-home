Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Credit Agricole
SA (ACA)  are among international banks withdrawing employees from
Dubai as deals dry up, revenue falls and lenders curb costs.  Deutsche Bank,  Germany ’s largest, will relocate Christopher Laing, head of  equity capital markets  for the Middle East and
 Africa , back to London after three years in Dubai.  Credit
Agricole ’s corporate and investment banking unit said last month
it would shut its mergers advisory team in Dubai.  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
transferred its regional head of equities, Adam Key, back to the
U.K. in recent months.  “Dubai never quite fulfilled its promise as a regional
banking hub,” said  Raj Madha , a banking analyst at Rasmala
Investment Bank Ltd., a Dubai-based asset manager. “With
limited capital market activity, and little sign of a serious
improvement in the near future, it’s not surprising that
investment banking costs are being transferred elsewhere.”  Banks are pulling staff from the Gulf Cooperation Council
region as a drought of mergers and share sales is compounded by
pressure to make savings at home. Fees earned by banks in the
 Middle East  fell 42 percent to $320 million in the first nine
months of the year from $551.1 million during the same period in
2010, according to New York-based research firm  Freeman & Co. 
Total fees in 2011 are 71 percent lower than in the first nine
months of 2008, when fees peaked at $1.1 billion.  ‘Different Mideast Countries’  “We are now more focused on cross-border operations and on
deals initiated from different Middle East countries, including
 Egypt ,” Bertrand Hugonet, a spokesman for Paris-based Credit
Agricole said in an e-mail. The firm will service merger clients
from Paris though “remains, of course, present in Dubai and
more globally in Middle East region.”  A spokesman for New York-based Citigroup, the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, declined to comment, while a Deutsche Bank
spokesman confirmed Laing’s relocation.  “Deutsche Bank’s commitment to the Middle East and North
Africa region remains unchanged, as well as Christopher Laing’s
function,” said Michael Lermer, a Frankfurt-based spokesman.
The firm “will continue to maintain a strong presence on the
ground.” Both Laing and Key will continue to cover the Middle
East region from  London .  The sovereign debt crisis in Europe is limiting revenue
from trading and curbing mergers and stock offerings in the euro
zone, prompting firms to cut jobs and reduce costs. In all,
banks have eliminated 137,000 jobs in the past 12 months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. The Arab
Spring has also slowed mergers in the region, and reduced the
volume of stocks traded on local exchanges.  ‘Banks Always Overshoot’  International banks may be cutting too many people too
soon, recruiters said. Increased public spending and oil output
will help economies in the Middle East and North Africa expand
faster than initially forecast, the  World Bank  said on Sept. 21
as it raised its 2011 growth estimate for the region to 4.1
percent from 3.6 percent.  “Investment banks always overshoot,” said Florence Eid,
founder and chief executive officer of Arabia Monitor, a London-
based research and advisory firm. “There were too many bankers
here at the height of the boom and the current retraction is
also too aggressive. This region is not going to fall off the
edge of a cliff and still needs bankers.”  Dubai’s credit risk has dropped over the past two years as
debt restructuring deals, bond repayments and profitability at
companies boost confidence in the emirate’s economic rebound.
The second-biggest of seven sheikhdoms that make up the U.A.E.,
Dubai is also benefiting from a stable government as political
upheaval sweeps other parts of the Middle East.  Bahrain Turmoil  Credit Agricole will relocate its regional headquarters out
of Bahrain following the unrest in the kingdom earlier this
year, two bankers familiar with the matter said in August. The
French bank will move most of the 75 to 100 Bahrain-based
employees into Dubai early next year, one of the bankers said,
declining to be identified because the matter is private.  Dubai set up the Dubai International Financial Center, a
tax-free business park for financial-services companies, in 2004
to attract global banks, asset managers and insurers to help
diversify its economy. Firms such as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
Citigroup and  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) , boosted their presence in the
region as rising oil wealth increased demand for financial
advice. By July, the DIFC had 11,331 full-time employees and 813
registered companies, according to the business park.  HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, said this week it will stop
offering brokerage services to retail investors in the  United
Arab Emirates  and focus on institutional clients after local
trading volumes and stocks plummeted. The bank will also close
its consumer operations in  Kuwait  as part of a strategic review.  Matthew Gribble, Dubai-based managing director of  Michael
Page International Plc. (MPI) , a recruiter that operates in 32
countries, says international banks are retaining a presence in
the Gulf region, though still “are scaling down.”  ‘Asked to Move’  “We’ve been getting calls from bankers who have been
working out here and have been asked to move, but would love to
stay for the lifestyle and the benefits they get,” he said.  Bankers working in Dubai enjoy tax-free salaries and higher
bonuses than their counterparts in  Europe  and the U.S., Gribble
said. In 2008, many were commanding “seven-figure basic
salaries with 100 percent bonuses,” Gribble said. In today’s
market bankers coming to the region can expect “more
reasonable” packages, he said.  Deutsche Bank’s Laing came to Dubai from London in July
2008, at the height of the banking boom to help build the bank’s
regional operation. Under his guidance, the bank last November
arranged a share sale for Axiom Ltd., a mobile-phone retailer
based in Dubai, in what would have been the United Arab
Emirates’ first initial public offering in two years. The
company abandoned the project in December, citing market
volatility.  ‘Inflated in 2007’  The pace of IPOs in the six-member GCC region has halved to
$400.5 million this year from $800.7 million in the same period
in 2010 and $10.2 billion in 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The levels of activity were certainly inflated in 2007
and 2008,” said Rasmala’s Madha. “I don’t think that level of
activity will ever return.”  Bankers are also confronting a slump in mergers and
acquisitions. The volume of deals in  Persian Gulf states  fell 60
percent to $24.9 billion this year from $39.9 billion in the
year earlier period, according to Bloomberg data.  Emirates Telecommunications Corp., the U.A.E. operator
known as Etisalat, abandoned plans in March to buy a majority
stake in Zain, Kuwait’s biggest mobile-phone company in a deal
that would have been valued at $12 billion. Six months later,
Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal’s  Kingdom Holding
Co. (KINGDOM)  and Bahrain Telecom Co. ended talks to buy out Zain’s stake
in its Saudi Arabian unit, a deal valued at about $950 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
