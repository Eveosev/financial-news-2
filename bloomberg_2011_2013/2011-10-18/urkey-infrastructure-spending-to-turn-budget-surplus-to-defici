Turkish spending on infrastructure,
transport and education means the budget will post a deficit of
22.2 billion liras this year from a surplus of 234 million liras
in the first nine months, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said.  Turkey  will still beat a budget deficit goal for this year,
Simsek said at a news conference in Ankara today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
