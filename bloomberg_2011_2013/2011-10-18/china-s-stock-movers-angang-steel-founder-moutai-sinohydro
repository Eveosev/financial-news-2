Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the market close in Shanghai.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, slid 2.3 percent to 2,383.49. The CSI
300 Index slumped 2.8 percent to 2,592.21.  Brokerages: Founder Securities Co. (601901 CH) and Haitong
Securities Co. (600837 CH) led declines for Chinese brokerages
amid speculation the nation slumping stock market and slowing
economy will curb earnings growth. A report today showed  China’s
economy  grew at the slowest pace in two years.  Founder plunged 7.5 percent to 6.64 yuan, while Haitong
lost 4.9 percent to 8.54 yuan.  Angang Steel Co. (000898 CH) dropped 5 percent to 5.12
yuan. Angang cut cold-rolled and hot-rolled steel product prices
from between 150 and 300 yuan a metric ton, researcher
Custeel.com said on its website yesterday after markets closed.
Angang is halting a blast furnace for annual maintenance amid
weakening demand from customers, board secretary Fu Jihui said
today in a phone interview.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111
CH) fell 5.8 percent, the most in a week, to 47.50 yuan. The
rare-earth producer cited falling prices and weak demand for a
production halt that will take effect tomorrow, the company said
in a statement to  Shanghai ’s stock exchange.  Sinohydro Group Ltd. (601669 CH), the nation’s largest
initial public offering this year, jumped 17 percent to 5.27
yuan in its trading debut. China’s biggest hydroelectric dam
builder will benefit from the push for greater water
conservation, said Li Jun, a strategist at Central China
Securities Co.  “Sinohydro’s businesses are viewed favorably,” Li said.
“Water conservancy is expected to have a rapid development in
the next decade.” There’s also a possibility that parent
Sinohydro Corp. may inject more capital in the company, Li said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
