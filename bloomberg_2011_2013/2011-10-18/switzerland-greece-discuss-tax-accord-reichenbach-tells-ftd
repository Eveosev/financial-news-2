Switzerland  and Greece are in
discussions about setting up a tax agreement,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported in a preview of tomorrow’s edition, citing
Horst Reichenbach, who heads a European Union task force on
rebuilding Greece’s economy.  “Switzerland has agreed to begin talks with Greece about a
tax accord similar to the one with  Germany ,” the newspaper
cited Reichenbach as saying. Such an agreement would help
prevent capital flight from Greece and increase the country’s
tax revenue, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
