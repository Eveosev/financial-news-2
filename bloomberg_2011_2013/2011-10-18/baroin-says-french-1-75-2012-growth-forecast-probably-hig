The French government’s forecast of
2012 growth of 1.75 percent is “probably too high,” French
Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  said.  The world’s major economies must take steps to avoid a new
economic slump, which would make cutting deficits even harder,
Baroin said in an interview on France2 television today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
