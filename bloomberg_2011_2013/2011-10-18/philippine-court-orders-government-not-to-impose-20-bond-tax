The Philippine Supreme Court will
stop the government from imposing and collecting a 20 percent
tax on interest income on 35 billion pesos worth of bonds due
today, spokesman Midas Marquez said in a mobile phone message.  The tax “shall be withheld by the banks and placed in
escrow pending resolution of the petition,” Marquez said,
revising an earlier statement. “A revised resolution is being
circulated. A temporary restraining order is being issued.”
The government expects to collect almost 5 billion pesos in
taxes from so-called PEACe bonds sold in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
