Premiums for Middle East oil for
sale to  Asia  rose for a fifth day on higher processing profits
and demand for cargoes.  Qatar Marine for loading in December climbed 10 cents to a
premium of 58 cents to its official selling price, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co., gained 3 cents to a premium of 20 cents. Upper
Zakum, also produced in the emirate, gained 3 cents to 51 cents
a barrel, the highest since Sept. 20.  The premiums for grades with a higher sulfur content such
as Upper Zakum have climbed as fuel oilâ€™s discount to benchmark
Dubai has narrowed to average $3.82 a barrel this month,
compared with $5.48 in September, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based brokerage.  Qatar International Petroleum Marketing Co., known as
Tasweeq, sold 3 million barrels of Al-Shaheen crude for loading
in December to Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and SK
Innovation Co., said three traders who participate in the market.
The grade fetched a premium of $2 a barrel to $2.50 to the price
of Dubai crude.  Dubai swaps for November narrowed to a premium of $1.57 a
barrel today compared with January from $1.62 yesterday,
according to data from PVM. This market situation known as
backwardation suggests demand is greater for immediate shipments.  Oman crude for immediate loading fell 2.79, or 2.6 percent,
to $105.45 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil for
loading in December dropped 2.6 percent to $105.02. Murban for
spot delivery declined 2.5 percent to $109.82.  Oman futures for December delivery fell 35 cents to $106.90
a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:34 p.m. Singapore
time with 1,636 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$107.22 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The December Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
narrowed 25 cents to $5.25 a barrel, said PVM. The exchange for
swaps for January fell 16 cents to $4.69.  To contact the reporter on this story:
