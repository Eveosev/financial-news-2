Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the Persian
Gulf country’s biggest bank by assets, said it’s in talks with
 Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  to buy a controlling stake in the Turkish lender.  “The ongoing negotiations are still in early stages and
their success depends on the conformity of DenizBank business
activities with QNB Group’s international expansion strategy
along with an agreement on a price that fairly reflects the
financial position of DenizBank and the result of its
operations,” Qatar National Bank said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Dexia SA, the bank being rescued by the Belgian and French
governments, has hired Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch and
White & Case LLP to evaluate options for its stake in Istanbul-
based Denizbank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
