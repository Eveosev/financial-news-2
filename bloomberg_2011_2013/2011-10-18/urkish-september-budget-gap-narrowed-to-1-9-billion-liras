Turkey’s budget produced its first
nine-month surplus in 27 years, an excess that will shift into
deficit by the end of 2011 as the government invests in
transport and education, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said.  The budget gap in September contracted to 1.9 billion liras
($1 billion) from 6.9 billion liras in the same month of 2010,
the Ankara-based ministry said on its website today. In the nine
months through September, the budget posted a surplus of 234
million liras, Simsek said at a news conference.  Gross domestic product expanded 8.8 percent annually in the
second quarter, boosting  tax revenue  and adding to income from
an offer to waive fines for people who repay overdue tax debts.
The over-performance has allowed the government to allocate an
additional 9.1 billion liras in spending this year on widening
roads, improving rail services and helping schools, Simsek said.  “We’ve added to infrastructure spending, and of course
this is the time of year when a lot of bills come due,” Simsek
said. “As a result we’ll end the year with a deficit of 22.2
billion liras.”  The forecast shortfall is about 1.7 percent of GDP, less
than the 33.5 billion lira deficit the government forecast at
the start of the year.  Growth is expected to slow to 4 percent in 2012, according
to the forecasts the government uses to plan its spending.  Excluding interest payments on debt, the budget produced a
surplus of 1.2 billion liras in September, compared with a
deficit of 2.9 billion liras a year earlier. The full year’s
budget will produce a primary surplus of 11.8 billion liras,
according to government projections.  Debt will fall to 39.8 percent of GDP this year from 42.3
percent in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
