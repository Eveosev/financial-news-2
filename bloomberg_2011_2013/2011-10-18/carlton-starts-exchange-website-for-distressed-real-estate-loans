Carlton Group, a property lender
that runs the Carlton Exchange listing service, started a
 website  to market distressed European real estate loans.  The website will allow investors to buy loans from European
banks, which are under pressure to sell the debt to reduce risk
on their balance sheets, according to a statement today. The New
York-based Carlton Exchange, or CEX, has more than $2 billion of
listings, Carlton Group Chairman Howard Michaels said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
