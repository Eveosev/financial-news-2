Philippine President  Benigno Aquino 
said it’s “not in the best interest” of the government to buy
 Petron Corp. (PCOR) ’s refinery as offered by company chairman Ramon Ang
last week.  Oil companies must be sensitive to consumer sentiment,
Aquino told reporters when asked if Petron’s offer is an
indication that oil companies are unhappy with their Philippine
investments.  “I don’t think at this point in time that it is in the
best interest of the government to rerun” the refinery, Aquino
said. “As a general rule, it is not efficient for the
government to run something that is a purely business
operation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
