BNP Paribas SA closed a
recommendation that investors buy the Chilean peso and sell
dollars after the currency appreciated 1.5 percent.  The French bank now suggests that  Chile â€™s two-year swap
rate, at 4.17 percent, will rise closer to the five-year swap,
now 4.74 percent, according to an e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
