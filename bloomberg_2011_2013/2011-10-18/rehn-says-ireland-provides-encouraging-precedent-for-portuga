European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said Ireland provides a “very
encouraging precedent” for Portugal in executing its deficit-
cutting program.  “The recent events in Ireland, which started its program
half a year earlier than Portugal, provide a very encouraging
precedent to Portugal,” Rehn said today in the text of a speech
for a conference in Lisbon. “Ireland has not only implemented
significant fiscal consolidation but has also been able to
handle in a determined fashion the banking sector problems,
which have been much more serious in Ireland than in Portugal,”
he said.  “Also, the unit labor costs have come substantially down
over the past three years refuting thus the claim that a country
within a currency union cannot improve its competitiveness
quickly,” Rehn said. “Given that  Portugal  has displayed
similar determination to address the key economic challenges as
Ireland, the Irish experience bodes well for Portugal.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
