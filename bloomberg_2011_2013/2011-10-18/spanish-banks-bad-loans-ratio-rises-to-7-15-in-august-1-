Defaults as a proportion of total
lending at Spanish banks rose in August as a real-estate crash
and unemployment at 21 percent made it harder for borrowers to
repay loans.  The bad-loans ratio climbed to 7.15 percent, the highest
since 1994, from a revised 6.93 percent in July, the Bank of
 Spain  said today on its website. Defaults increased to 127.7
billion euros ($174.9 billion) from 124.6 billion euros a month
earlier, the regulator said.  Bad loans have  piled up  on the books of Spanish banks,
forcing them to set aside more than 100 billion euros of
provisions since 2008 as the nation struggles to restore growth
after a property crash sparked the worst recession in 60 years.  Emilio Botin, chairman of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s
biggest bank, said in a Sept. 30 speech that the lender expects
similar provisioning charges in 2012 to this year and that bad
loans and funding costs in Spain will “normalize” in 2013.  In addition to rising defaults, Spanish banks are allowing
their loan books to shrink, a factor that is also helping to
drive up the bad-loans ratio. Lending to residents shrank 1.8
percent from a year earlier, the Bank of Spain said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
