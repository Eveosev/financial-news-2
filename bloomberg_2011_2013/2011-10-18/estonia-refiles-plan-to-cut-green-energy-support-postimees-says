Estoniaâ€™s Economy Ministry has
prepared a draft bill to reduce subsidies for renewable energy
producers by half in 2013,  Postimees  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The plan, which will make subsidies dependent on the
Nordpool market price of electricity, is similar to the one
Economy Minister Juhan Parts presented last September. It was
shelved before the March parliamentary elections due to
opposition from ruling the Reform Party of Premier Andrus Ansip,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
