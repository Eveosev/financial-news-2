The euro risks breaking up if  France 
should lose its triple-A rating, the Handelsblatt reported,
citing the opinion of Berlin’s DIW institute’s chief macro-
economic forecaster Ansgar Belke.  Financial-market confidence in the ability of the euro-
region to solve the debt crisis rests in part on the top rating
of its biggest economies, Belke is cited as saying.  France is the second biggest underwriter of the euro’s
rescue fund’s guarantees, implying that a ratings downgrade
would be transmitted to the fund, impairing the work of a key
tool to tackle the crisis and raising the specter of a break-up
of the currency in a worst-case scenario, Belke said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
