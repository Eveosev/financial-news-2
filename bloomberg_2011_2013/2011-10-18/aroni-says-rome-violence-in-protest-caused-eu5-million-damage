Violence that erupted during the
protests in Rome Oct. 15 caused about 5 million euros of damage
to the city, Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said
today. The minister told the Senate that he will propose
measures “to put police in a position to intervene with pre-
emptive actions” during violent demonstrations.  Maroni also said that he will ask the administration to
eliminate the planned cuts to his ministry’s budget that were
included in the government’s austerity package approved last
month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
