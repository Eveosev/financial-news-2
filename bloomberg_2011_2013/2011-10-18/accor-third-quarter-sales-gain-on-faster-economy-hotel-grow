Accor SA (AC) ,  Europe ’s largest hotel
company, said third-quarter sales rose 2.7 percent, matching
estimates, as more guests stayed at its economy hotels.  Sales in the three months ended September climbed to 1.62
billion euros ($2.22 billion) from 1.58 billion euros a year
earlier, Paris-based Accor said in a statement today. That was
in line with the average of four estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Accor, which generates about half its earnings from economy
lodgings, is updating lower-priced hotels and combining them
under the ibis brand in an effort to attract more customers.
Premier Inn, a budget-hotel chain that competes with Ibis brands
in the U.K., boosted first-half sales 11 percent as it gained
market share, owner  Whitbread Plc (WTB)  said today.  Revenue growth was faster in the economy segment, led by
strong demand and a recovery in average room rates, Accor said
in the statement. Sales in the fourth quarter are sustained and
the company said it hasn’t seen signs of a slowdown.  The company confirmed its full-year target for earnings
before interest and taxes of as much as 530 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
