Latvia’s parliament re-elected
Sovita Aboltina as speaker of parliament a day after failing
twice to elect former President Valdis Zatlers to the position.  Aboltina was approved 51-44 in a secret ballot in the 100-
member legislature in the capital Riga today.  Zatlers’s Reform Party, which is trying to form a three-
party government this week, lost six members on Oct. 16. The
defectors say they will continue to support Premier Valdis Dombrovskis of the Unity Party for another term of office,
though it reduces the coalition to 50 seats from 56 seats.  President Andris Berzins won’t recognize the six rebel
lawmakers as part of the coalition and has given the parties
until tomorrow to come up with a new vision for the group, the
 Baltic News Service  reported, citing spokeswoman Liga Krapane.  Since turning to the European Commission and the
 International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.3
billion) loan in 2008, the Baltic country has lowered spending
and raised taxes equal to about 16 percent of gross domestic
product. It plans further cuts in spending next year to reduce
the  budget deficit  to 2.5 percent of GDP and adopt the euro in
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
