The owners of  Florida ’s Sawgrass
Marriott Resort won bankruptcy court approval for a
reorganization plan that will give ownership of the resort to
secured lender Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul Glenn in Jacksonville, Florida,
today signed the final order approving the plan, according to
court papers.  The plan will give the unit of New York-based  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  ownership of the resort, an unsecured claim of about
$63.8 million, and a secured claim of $132 million. Trade
suppliers with $190,000 in claims will recover about half of
that amount, court papers show.  The franchise agreement with Marriott International Inc.
will continue under Goldman Sachs’s ownership while the
management agreement with Interstate Hotels & Resorts LLC will
be canceled, according to the plan.  Goldman Sachs Commercial Mortgage Capital LP helped finance
the $220.5 million purchase of the 65-acre resort in  Ponte Vedra
Beach , Florida, by RQB Resort and RQB Development.  RQB Resort sought Chapter 11 protection in March 2010
listing assets and debt of as much as $500 million each. RQB
Development also filed for bankruptcy.  The case is In re RQB Resort LP, 10-01596,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville).  To contact the reporter on this story:
