Iranian president  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said he doesn’t expect a war with the U.S. despite
the “wish” of some in the U.S. government.  “I don’t expect such a thing to happen,” Ahmadinejad told
the Al Jazeera English-language television in an interview in
Tehran yesterday, according to a transcript published on the
president’s  website  today. “Yes, there are certain individuals
in the U.S. administration who have such a wish but facing them
are some reasonable people in that country who know this
shouldn’t happen.”  Military force should not be ruled out as a response to an
alleged Iranian assassination plot on U.S. soil, Michigan
Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence, said Oct. 16 on ABC’s “This
Week.” Iranian officials have rejected the accusation, calling
it a fabrication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
