Barclays Plc (BARC)  failed to convince a
London court to hold Britain’s financial regulator liable for
losses suffered when a gold mining company accused of fraud had
its assets at the bank frozen.  Judges at the U.K.’s Court of Appeal today refused to grant
an order saying the Financial Services Authority should pay for
all losses resulting from an injunction freezing the Barclays
accounts of  Sinaloa Gold Plc. (S6G)   The U.K.’s second-largest bank had argued the FSA should
pay for all costs resulting from its enforcement actions, not
just the expense of finding and freezing the assets. Judge
Nicholas Patten disagreed, saying in a written verdict this type
of order would be “a kind of blank cheque.”  The FSA is investigating Sinaloa, which explores for gold
in  Mexico , and trading company PH Capital Invest over the
alleged sale of “worthless” shares in a boiler-room fraud,
according to the appeal court judgment.  In Dec. 2010, the FSA won an order prohibiting the sale of
Sinaloa stock and freezing assets with a value of up to 858,267
pounds ($1.3 million).  The FSA and Barclays didn’t immediately respond to requests
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
