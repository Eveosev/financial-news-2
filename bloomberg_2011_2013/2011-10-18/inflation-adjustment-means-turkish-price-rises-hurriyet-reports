Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet
Simsek may add to this month’s tax rises with increases to the
fees the government charges for services such as issuing
passports, Hurriyet reported.  The ministry in Ankara set a rate of 10.2 percent for
revisions to flat charges to keep pace with inflation, the
newspaper reported. That’s likely to mean higher traffic fines,
as well as fees for court services, passports, and licences, it
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
