The BdB Association of German Banks
said it opposes a proposal to separate  investment banking  and
commercial banking.  “The two business areas are difficult to distinguish from
each other,” BdB said in an e-mailed statement today. “Even
savings banks and cooperative banks offer investment banking
services to their customers as they are indispensable to finance
companies.”  Sigmar Gabriel, leader of  Germany ’s main opposition  Social
Democratic Party , told Spiegel magazine in an interview
yesterday that German banks should split investment banking and
commercial banking business and investment banks should receive
no government help.  “Even without separating the traditional banking business
from investment banking, it is necessary, reasonable and
possible to counteract undesirable developments in investment
banking by appropriate counter measures,” BdB said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
