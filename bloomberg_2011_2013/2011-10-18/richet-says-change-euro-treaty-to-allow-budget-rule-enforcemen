European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the euro’s founding treaty should be
changed to allow decisions to be imposed on member states that
don’t comply with fiscal rules.  It should be possible to “impose decisions” on countries
that “persist” in not complying with the Stability and Growth
Pact, Trichet told the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , according
to a transcript of the interview published by the Frankfurt-
based ECB today.  Trichet said the central bank was forced to re-start its
bond-purchase program in August because governments dragged
their feet on the implementation of changes they had agreed on
to boost  Europe ’s bailout fund, the EFSF.  “There were then delays, and so the ECB once again found
itself in a situation where it had to intervene in the  bond
market  in order to safeguard the transmission of monetary
policy,” he said.  Trichet said “the responsibility lies with governments” to
solve the debt crisis.  “The most important thing for the ECB is to ensure medium
and long-term stability, and that is why it cannot use monetary
policy to put right the failings of government policies,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
