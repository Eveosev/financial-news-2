One Sunday morning a few months ago, there was a knock on the door of my little flat in Bombay. I opened it sleepily to find three officers of the state, who said they wanted to speak to me about something important. If this were Stalin's  Russia , I'd have been off to the gulag for the crime of poking fun at communism in my deeply allegorical novel. If this were a story by  Franz Kafka , I'd have been led off for an offense mysterious even to those who had come to seize me. If this were a scenario imagined by my grandfather (a retired bureaucrat profoundly disappointed by my decision to earn my living as a wandering storyteller) then my visitors' intent would have been to persuade me to begin a career, belatedly, with the Indian Civil Service. The reality, though, was at once more prosaic and more poetical. The three visitors were all schoolteachers, and they'd come to my door on their day off as agents of probably the largest peacetime operation in the world. In the first year of every decade the government of  India  conducts a  census of its citizens , maintaining a tradition stretching back to the first attempts of the colonial state in 1872 to put together an accurate picture of India. This year, about 2.7 million data collectors or enumerators, mostly people holding junior and middle-level posts in government services and volunteers, were sent into town and village over a period of three weeks to meet and learn about their 1.2 billion compatriots who constituted their data set. This year, India's  Census Commission  prepared the same questionnaire in 16 languages. See the English version  here . It seemed to me, as I sat down to answer questions about my mother tongue, marital status, occupation, housing, and income that the Census, much more than the national anthem or the Constitution or a sporting event, was the only project that brought all the people of India -- diverse, disordered and unruly, a dizzying array of ethnicities and a Babel of languages, more the idea of a nation than a nation -- together into one frame. The Census is also a project of great significance for almost any kind of policy. As the demographer Ashish Bose  wrote in 2004 : The Census project is so vast that a consolidated picture of what  one newspaper called  "a database on demography, economic activity, literacy and education, housing and household amenities, urbanisation, fertility and mortality, social structure, language, religion and migration" will be available only in 2012. But all through 2011 the office of the Census Commission had been releasing trickles (relatively speaking) of data about India today, many of which are of interest. For instance, we now know from the Census's  Provisional Population Totals , broken down state by state, that India's population is now 1.21 billion, up 181 million (close to the entire population of  Brazil ) since 2001. Despite the enormous numbers of people added in 10 years to a largely poor country struggling to adequately supply education and employment to its citizens, there was some good news in these figures. The average 10-year growth in population was down 3.90 percent from the previous decade, from 21.5 percent to 17.6 percent, the sharpest decline since independence. Or, as the Census report called " Size, Growth Rate and Distribution of Population " put it, "although India continues to grow in size, its pace of net addition is on the decrease." It seems that by 2060, India might achieve population stability -- which wouldn't be bad for a country whose population tripled in the second half of the Twentieth Century. The other piece of heartening news is that  literacy was up  by almost 15 percent in the last decade, to a 74 percent rate from 64.8 percent in 2001. These figures give a sense of the enormous challenges faced by that much-maligned entity, the Indian state, in its efforts to attend to the needs and aspirations of its subjects. The Census also has much to say about the  changing relationship between urban and rural India . Although there are far more Indians living in rural areas than in cities -- about two people live in  villages  for every urban resident -- this is qualified somewhat by the information that, for the first time since independence, the absolute increase in population was greater in urban areas than in rural areas. This matter greatly exercised  P Sainath , the distinguished rural affairs correspondent of the Indian newspaper The Hindu, who inquired into its possible causes in a two-part series last month. In a piece called " Decadal journeys: debt and despair spur urban growth ," Sainath wrote: It isn't just the answers in the Census forms that are likely to be revealing of Indian realities. Even the changes in the questions asked this time tell a story. Taking account of the growing material prosperity of Indians as well as the communications revolution of the last decade, the Census now asked respondents whether they owned a computer or a mobile phone. Showing a greater sensitivity to diversity in self-definitions of gender than before, the Census form allowed respondents for the first time to specify a gender other than "male" or "female." Other subtleties and refinements in classification might confound non-Indians (we are told, for instance, that among the nine different options for "Type of roof," including mud and grass, there is a further division of Answer No.3, "Tiles," into hand-made and machine-made) but they supply a richer account of Indian realities to those who know how to interpret them. With regard to the matter of bathrooms, Census 2011 changes the old yes-or-no question of "Bathroom within the house" to "Bathing facility within the premises." This is a consequence of realizing "that bathroom within the house was a predominantly urban phenomenon." And last, the Census, besides making an effort to connect to the youth through a  Facebook page  and a  Twitter account , also had a mascot for the first time: a  woman  in a simple shalwar-kameez, representing the humble enumerator who goes from household to household in search of data. A page on the Census website  told from the point of view of an imaginary enumerator  enthused: All year long, in my travels around the country, I've grown used to seeing scrawled above every doorbell I ring the words "Census 2011" -- perhaps the modern secular and political equivalent of finding that Father Christmas has left something at the bedpost of every child on Christmas Eve. Even to someone who isn't particularly nationalistic, there is something reassuring about this. One might say that it is through the Census form, more than any other document or procedure of citizenship, that the average man or woman of the world's largest democracy contributes his or her story to the story of his country.
