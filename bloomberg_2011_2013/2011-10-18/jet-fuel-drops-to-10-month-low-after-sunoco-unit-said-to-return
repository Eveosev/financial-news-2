Jet fuel in New York weakened to the
lowest level since December after  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  was said to start
a unit at its Marcus Hook refinery in  Pennsylvania .  A fluid catalytic cracker was restarted at the plant,
according to a person yesterday, who declined to be identified
because the information is not public.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc delayed maintenance on a hydrocracker
at the Pernis oil refinery in Rotterdam by four months,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter, weakening
margins to export oil products from the U.S.  The premium for jet fuel in New York Harbor versus heating
oil futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell 3
cents to 1 cent a gallon at 3:37 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Itâ€™s the lowest level since Dec. 8.
Prompt delivery slipped 1.59 cents to $3.0377 a gallon.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel slipped 0.75 cent
to 3.75 cents a gallon.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  New York  narrowed its
premium to futures 2.62 cents to 4.63 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
