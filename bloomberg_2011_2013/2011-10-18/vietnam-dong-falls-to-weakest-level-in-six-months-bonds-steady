Vietnam’s dong fell to the weakest
level in almost six months as the central bank set the
currency’s reference rate lower.  Government bonds  were steady.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set the daily rate 0.1 percent
weaker at 20,723 per dollar, the eighth time this month it fixed
a lower level, according to its website. The currency has
dropped 0.6 percent since Sept. 23, when preliminary data from
the General Statistics Office showed the nation’s trade deficit
widened to $1 billion last month from a revised $396 million in
August.  “Factors that put pressure on the dong are still there:
trade deficit and dollar loans maturing around this time,” said
Nguyen Tan Thang, head of fixed-income research at Ho Chi Minh
City Securities Corp. “There’s also more demand for foreign
currency to import goods for Christmas and the Lunar New Year.”  The dong slid 0.8 percent, the most since Aug. 8, to 20,928
per dollar as of 3:25 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That was the weakest level since April 22. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the central bank’s fixing.  Consumer prices rose 22.4 percent in September from a year
earlier after having increased 23 percent in August, the
statistics office said last month. Still,  Vietnam ’s inflation
rate remains the fastest in a basket of 17 Asian economies
tracked by Bloomberg.  “Inflation is still high and that also hurts investor
confidence in the dong,” Thang said.  The yield on the government’s five-year bonds was little
changed at 12.41 percent, according to a daily fixing price from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
