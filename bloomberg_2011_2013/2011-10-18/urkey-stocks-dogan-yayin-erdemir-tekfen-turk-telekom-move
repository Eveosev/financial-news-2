Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  rose 0.3 percent to 58,250.26 at 3:40 p.m. in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active.  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  ,  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s unit in Turkey, added
13 percent to 15.10 liras. Qatar National Bank aims to buy a
controlling stake in the Turkish lender, it said in a statement
today.  Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL)  , Turkey’s biggest media
group, fell 4.2 percent to 68 kurus after saying it sold
television channel Star TV to Ferit Sahenk’s Dogus Yayin Holding
AS for $327 million. Though the sale will help lower Dogan
Yayin’s “highly leveraged” net debt position, a “declining
share of the group in the media sector is not a positive
development in the long run,” Bulent Yurdagul, co-head of
Turkey research for HSBC Holdings Plc in Istanbul, said in
response to e-mailed questions.  Dogan Sirketler Grubu Holdings (DOHOL)  AS, Dogan Yayin’s
parent company, fell 3.1 percent to 62 kurus. Dogan bought Star
TV for $306.5 million in 2005 after the channel was seized from
the Uzan family to help recoup $6 billion in losses at a bank
run by the Uzans.  Eregli Demir & Celik Fabrikalari AS (EREGL TI), Turkey’s
biggest steel maker and known as Erdemir, rose 2.4 percent to
3.43 liras, heading for its highest since Sept. 2. The company
had its long-term corporate  credit rating  raised to ‘B’ from ‘B-
’ at  Standard & Poor’s , which cited greater efficiency and
capacity, and a higher-value product-mix.  Tekfen Holding AS (TKFEN)  , a builder, rose 0.4 percent
to 5.94 liras, gaining for a third day, after saying its
construction company started talks with Tecnicas Reunidas SA of
 Spain  to cooperate on an upgrade to a refinery owned by  Tupras
Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS. (TUPRS)   Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM)  , Turkey’s biggest phone
company, added 0.3 percent to 7.58 liras, gaining for the first
day in four. The company may report profit declined 31 percent
in the third quarter over the same period last year, according
to the average of 15 analysts’ estimates on Bloomberg. Turk
Telekom is due to report earnings today, kicking off the
reporting season for the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
