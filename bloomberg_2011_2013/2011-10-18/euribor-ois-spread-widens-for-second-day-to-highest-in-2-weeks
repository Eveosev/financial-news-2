Banks in  Europe  are the most
reluctant in two weeks to lend to one another, according to a
money markets indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight index swaps, was 76.5 basis
points as of 12 p.m. in  London , from 75.5 yesterday. That’s the
biggest gap since Oct. 5 and compares with 89 basis points on
Sept. 23, when the measure was its widest since March 2009.  The cost for European banks to convert euro interest
payments into dollars rose. The one-year basis swap was 66 basis
points under the euro interbank offered rate, from 65 yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap  was 90.5 basis
points below Euribor from 91. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Overnight deposits at the  European Central Bank  rose. Banks
parked 165 billion euros ($226 billion) at the Frankfurt-based
ECB yesterday, up from 136 billion euros on Oct. 14. That
compares with a year-to-date average of 60 billion euros.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.579 percent from 1.578
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor fell to 1.166 percent from
1.171 percent.  The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for the 28th day to 0.409 percent from 0.406
percent, according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s
the highest since Aug. 6, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was little
changed at 38.5 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
