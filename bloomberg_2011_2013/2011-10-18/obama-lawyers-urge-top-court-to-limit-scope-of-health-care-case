The Obama administration urged the
U.S. Supreme Court to limit its review of the landmark health-
care overhaul, saying the justices shouldn’t consider two of the
issues raised by 26 states in their bid for a hearing.  In court papers filed yesterday, the  Justice Department 
said the court should focus on the law’s requirement that
Americans either acquire insurance or pay a penalty. Lower
courts are divided on the constitutionality of the provision.  The states, led by Florida, are also challenging the 2010
law’s expansion of Medicaid, the joint federal-state health-care
program for the poor. In addition, the states are seeking an
exemption from the penalties that they and other employers would
face for failing to offer adequate health insurance to workers.  U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said in the latest
court filing that those issues aren’t worthy of Supreme Court
review.  Verrilli, the administration’s top courtroom advocate, said
the high court should take up a third issue raised by the
states: the impact that a decision striking down the mandate
would have on the rest of the law. The Obama administration
asked the high court last month to consider whether Congress had
the constitutional authority to enact the mandate.  The administration filed its response two weeks ahead of
the deadline. That clears the way for the court to say as soon
as early November whether it will take up the case.  The states’ case is  Florida  v.  U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, 11-400.  To contact the reporter on this story:
