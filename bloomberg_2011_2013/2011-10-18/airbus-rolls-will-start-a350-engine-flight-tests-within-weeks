Airbus SAS and Rolls-Royce Holdings
Plc will begin in-flight testing of the Trent XWB engine for the
A350 wide-body passenger jet in the coming weeks.  Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.,
has installed the turbine on an A380 to carry out the tests, the
Toulouse, France-based planemaker said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Last week, Airbus opened a wing-factory in Broughton,  Wales 
for the A350, a plane that is mainly built from composite
materials. The plane is scheduled to enter service by the end of
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
