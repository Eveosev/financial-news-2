Arsenal said injured defender  Thomas Vermaelen  signed a new ‘long-term’ contract with the north
London soccer team.  The 25-year-old Belgian made the most appearances of any
other Arsenal player in his first year at the club and was named
to the Professional Footballers Association team of the 2009-
2010 season. His extension was announced in a statement on the
Gunners website.  Arsenal has struggled this season, and is 10th in the 20-
team Premier League. The club is regrouping after selling
captain Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasri, Emmanuel Eboue and  Gael Clichy  over the summer, while bringing in  Mikel Arteta , Per
Mertesacker,  Yossi Benayoun , Andre Santos and Gervinho. New
captain Robin Van Persie, whose contract expires after next
season, said he doesn’t want to negotiate an extension during
the season.  “Our plan is always to sign top quality players and with
Thomas extending his contract, we have done just that,” coach
Arsène Wenger said in the statement.  Last week, Wenger said Vermaelen will return in two to
three weeks from an ankle injury that kept him out since August.
He missed much of last season after hurting his other foot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
