European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Andres Lipstok  said the bank’s liquidity and
bond-buying measures may reduce the incentives for governments
to act to solve the debt crisis.  Lipstok said the ECB’s so-called non-standard measures only
address the symptoms of the problem and not the cause, and that
the Frankfurt-based ECB’s options to combat the crisis are
“relatively limited,” according to a commentary for the
Postimees newspaper published by the Estonian central bank,
which Lipstok heads.  The ECB’s non-standard measures are “clearly temporary,”
Lipstok said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
