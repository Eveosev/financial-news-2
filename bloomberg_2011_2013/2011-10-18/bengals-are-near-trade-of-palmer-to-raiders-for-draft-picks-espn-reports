The  Oakland Raiders  are close to
acquiring quarterback  Carson Palmer  from the Cincinnati Bengals
for two first-round draft picks, ESPN reports, citing people
familiar with the situation.  Palmer, 31, told Cincinnati television station WCPO in
March that he would rather retire than return to the Bengals,
saying he had $80 million in the bank and that, “I don’t have to
play football for money. I’ll play it for the love of the game
but that would have to be elsewhere.” He is signed through 2014.  The Bengals gave the starting job to Andy Dalton this
season and are 4-2. The Raiders are also 4-2 and lost
quarterback Jason Campbell with a broken collarbone on Oct. 16.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
