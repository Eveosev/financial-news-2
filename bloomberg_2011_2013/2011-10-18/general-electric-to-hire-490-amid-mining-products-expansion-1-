General Electric Co. (GE)  plans to build
a mining equipment plant in  Texas  and upgrade a factory in
Pennsylvania, adding 490 workers.  The projects are part of the GE transportation business’s
expansion into mining equipment as it branches out from
locomotives, which use similar technology, Lorenzo Simonelli,
the unit’s chief, said in a telephone interview.  The expansion “gives us more scale in mining,” Simonelli
said.  Demand for such equipment is growing worldwide as emerging
markets seek more raw materials such as rare earths and copper
for infrastructure. Copper prices have more than doubled since
the end of 2008 as demand climbed in  China , the world’s biggest
metals user.  The Texas plant, to be located near a Fort Worth locomotive
factory announced in May, will build motorized wheels for off-
highway vehicles, GE said in the statement. The $95 million site
will employ about 130 workers, GE Transportation said.  About 360 employees will be hired in Erie,  Pennsylvania ,
including 160 production workers to meet higher demand for
mining equipment, GE said. The company will invest about $136
million in upgrading the plant, which is more than 100 years
old, to boost capacity, add research and testing technology and
install a customer showcase center.  About $22 million of the Erie upgrades is related to mining
equipment production, GE said. Mining has also been a focus for
the Fairfield, Connecticut-based parent company’s energy
business, which has invested in oil-and-gas acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
