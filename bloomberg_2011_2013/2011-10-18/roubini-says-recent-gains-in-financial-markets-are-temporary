Nouriel Roubini , co-founder and
chairman of Roubini Global Economics LLC, said recent gains in
financial markets are temporary and there’s a 60 percent
probability of a simultaneous recession in most advanced
economies, including the U.S., U.K. and the euro zone.  “In the past few weeks, markets have rallied on better
than expected U.S. economic data and optimism on a solution for
the euro zone crisis,” Roubini said at the Asset Allocation
Summit in London today. “But this is short-term noise rather
than something fundamental.   ‘‘The nature of what happens in the recession will depend
on the euro zone,’’ Roubini said. ‘‘If there’s a disorderly
outcome, the shocks to the global economy that could happen
could be similar to that in 2008.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
