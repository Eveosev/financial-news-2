Serbia  plans to boost arable areas
under irrigation by tenfold over the next four years and will
seek offers for a first phase of the project in early 2012,
Agriculture Minister Dusan Petrovic said.  The government is preparing procurement invitations for
bringing irrigation to 250,000 hectares (618,000 acres) as a
first step in the plan to have 1.1 million hectares covered by
irrigation channels by 2015, minister Petrovic said at a
conference in Belgrade today. Initial estimates have put the
overall costs at 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion), “but the
actual price will be determined in tenders,” he said.  “With just 100,000 hectares with irrigation out of 4.2
million hectares of arable land in the country, we are at the
bottom in  Europe ,” in terms of percentage of irrigated land,
Petrovic said.  Serbia seeks to boost its agriculture and processed food
industry to increase exports and narrow the  trade gap , Petrovic
said. The country’s $1.1 billion  trade surplus  in agriculture
and food items in 2010 is expected to increase this year, after
rising 30 percent over the first nine months, he said.  Most areas planned for irrigation are in the northern
Vojvodina province, Serbia’s breadbasket, and the cost will be
covered by national and provincial budgets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
