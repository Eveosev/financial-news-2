Ethanol futures declined for the
first time in four days in  Chicago  on speculation higher prices
for the fuel will erode demand.  Futures fell the most since Oct. 6 after gaining 9.5
percent this month, outpacing the 8.7 percent jump in corn, the
primary ingredient in ethanol in the U.S. Ethanol is blended
with gasoline to meet federal regulations and boost supply.  “There’s a lack of direction,” said  Terry Reilly , an
analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.  The
biofuel has outperformed “relative to corn.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery fell 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.722 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 14 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slumped
12.5 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $2.70 a gallon and in  New York 
the additive decreased 8 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.84,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slid 5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.765
a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel declined 2.5 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $2.89.  Corn for December delivery advanced 3.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $6.44 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes about
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
