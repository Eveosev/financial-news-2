Italy’s business leaders called on
Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  to push through measures to
boost economic growth, saying he’s run out of time to restore
international investors’ confidence in the country.  “The situation is more and more difficult and the
confidence in our country is quickly falling, despite Italy’s
undeniable strengths,” business leaders including the president
of the Confindustria employers’ lobby,  Emma Marcegaglia , and the
head of the ABI banking association,  Giuseppe Mussari , said
today in an e-mailed statement. “Italy has the resources to get
back on its feet, but there’s no time left.”  Standard & Poor’s Investor Service cut Italy’s credit
rating last month for the first time in five years, citing high
debt, weak economic growth and a “fragile” government. Italy
is trying to tackle rising borrowing costs that prompted the
 European Central Bank  to buy its bonds to try to stem contagion
from the region’s debt crisis.  “We trust your government is willing to implement all the
initiatives needed to deal with the seriousness of the present
time,” the business leaders said in the statement, an open
letter to the premier.  Italy has had average annual growth of 0.9 percent since
Berlusconi was elected to his first of three terms in 1994,
compared with 1.6 percent for the euro region as a whole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
