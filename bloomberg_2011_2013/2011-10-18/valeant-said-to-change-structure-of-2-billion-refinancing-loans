Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX) ,  Canada ’s biggest drugmaker, changed the
structure of a senior secured credit facility it’s seeking to
refinance debt, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The 4 1/2-year debt was increased to $2 billion from $1.7
billion, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the terms are private. The financing now consists of a $1.225
billion term loan A, a $275 million revolving line of credit
that was increased from $200 million, and a $500 million
delayed-draw term loan, according to the person.  Valeant, based in Mississauga, Ontario, will pay 2.5
percentage points to 3 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate tied to a leveraged-based grid. Pricing
is set to open at 2.75 percentage points more than Libor, the
person said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. arranged
the deal and expect to close the transaction on Oct. 20, the
person said.  Lenders who make commitments of $100 million will receive
an upfront fee of 75 basis points and lenders who commit $25
million will receive a 25 basis-point fee. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Laurie Little, spokeswoman for Valeant, didn’t respond to
an e-mail seeking comment.  A  term loan  A is sold mainly to banks. In a revolving
credit facility, money can be borrowed once it’s repaid; in a
term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
