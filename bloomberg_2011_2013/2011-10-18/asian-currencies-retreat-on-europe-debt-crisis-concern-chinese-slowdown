Asian currencies weakened, led by
Malaysia’s ringgit, after  Germany  said it was unrealistic for
European policy makers to agree on a comprehensive plan to
resolve their debt crisis as early as this weekend.  The region’s currencies maintained losses after China
reported today that its economy grew 9.1 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace since 2009 and
less than the 9.3 percent expansion forecast by economists
polled by Bloomberg. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office
knocked down what it called “dreams” that an Oct. 23 summit
would be the last word in taming  Europe ’s debt woes.  “It’s  risk aversion  that is affecting Asian currencies,”
said  Sacha Tihanyi , a Hong Kong-based currency strategist at
Scotia Capital, the investment banking unit of Bank of Nova
Scotia. “The typical habit of euro-zone policy makers is to
disappoint the markets.”  Malaysia’s ringgit lost 0.8 percent to 3.1305 per dollar as
of 4:25 p.m. local time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  South Korea ’s won fell 0.5 percent to 1,145.60.
Indonesia’s rupiah declined 0.5 percent to 8,860, and Thailand’s
baht dropped 0.4 percent to 30.73.  The won retreated from the strongest level in almost a
month, reached yesterday. South Korea’s consumer prices will
probably stabilize next year, Yonhap News reported today, citing
comments made by central bank Governor Kim Choong Soo at a press
briefing in  London . The inflation rate was 4.3 percent in
September, down from a three-year high of 5.3 percent the
previous month, official figures show.  Chinese Growth  “That Europe’s debt crisis will take longer to resolve was
expected, but it will still affect the currency,” said Sam Hong, senior vice president in charge of currency strategy at
 Shinhan Bank  in Seoul.  China , the world’s second-biggest economy, reported today
that industrial production increased 13.8 percent in September
from a year earlier. That compared with the 13.4 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey and a gain of 13.5 percent the
previous month. Retail sales expanded 17.7 percent after a 17
percent increase in August.  The yuan slid 0.17 percent to 6.3813 per dollar, having
been 0.07 percent weaker before the gross domestic product
figures were released, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System.  The baht retreated from a three-week high as the nation’s
worst floods in five decades disrupt manufacturing, hurting
exports and economic growth. The government estimated the
disaster swamped at least 930 factories employing more than
300,000 workers.  “Some big companies have halted production due to the
floods, and this will affect our economy,” said Disawat
Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl.  Elsewhere,  Taiwan ’s dollar weakened 0.3 percent to
NT$30.201 per dollar and the Philippine peso slipped 0.4 percent
to 43.280.  To contact the reporters on this story:
