Hwange Colliery Ltd.,  Zimbabwe ’s
largest coal miner, plans to ship 30,000 to 50,000 metric tons
of coal a month through Mozambique’s port of Maputo, Business
Development Manager Oliver Maponga said today.  Hwange is in talks with port authorities after starting to
use Mozambique’s central Beira port last year, Maponga said in
an interview in Maputo. The company, which produces 400,000 tons
of coal a month, is studying markets in India,  China  and western
Europe, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
