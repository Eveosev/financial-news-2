German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is
grateful for Egypt’s role in the release of captured Israeli
soldier Gilad Shalit and hopes ties between the two countries
will now improve, according to an e-mailed government statement.  Restoring “good-neighborly relations” after recent
tension between Israel and Egypt “would be an important
contribution to the Middle East peace process,” Merkel was
quoted as saying in a statement by Steffen Seibert, her chief
spokesman, today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
