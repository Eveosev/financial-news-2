New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
called for an amendment to the state constitution that would
subject judges to a public pension overhaul enacted this year.  Christie, 49, said he’ll try to get the proposal on the
November 2012 ballot. He spoke to reporters a day after Superior
Court Judge Linda Feinberg in Mercer County ruled that members
of the judiciary are exempt from a law requiring higher pension
contributions by public workers. Christie said he will appeal.  “This is a blatant attempt to exact special treatment for
themselves because they have the power,” Christie said today in
Trenton. “Judge Feinberg’s decision, in addition to legally
indefensible, is morally indefensible. If the courts will not
fix this problem, the Legislature has to give the people the
opportunity to fix this problem.”  Feinberg, who ruled on a claim brought by Superior Court
Judge Paul DePascale in her Trenton court, declined to comment.  “There is no response or comment on anything coming from
chambers,” Jeff Starr, a law clerk for Feinberg, said by
telephone.  A typical judge in  New Jersey  will collect pension payments
of more than $2 million while paying about $59,000 into the
system over a career, Christie said. Members of the judiciary
can retire after 10 years with stipends equal to 75 percent of
pay, Christie said.  An increase in contributions, required for state workers
under the law Christie signed in June, would be a “diminution
of salary,” Feinberg said in her ruling. The decision applies
to 432 judges, Christie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
