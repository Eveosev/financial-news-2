France  is taking “important” steps
to cut its  budget deficit , the European Commission said.  “The French authorities over the summer took important
decisions in terms of stepping up the consolidation efforts, in
order to ensure they can met the targets,” commission spokesman
 Amadeu Altafaj  told reporters in Brussels today.  He declined to comment on the threat of a cut in France’s
AAA credit rating, saying “there’s no reason to raise alarms or
to speculate.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
