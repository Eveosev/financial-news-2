JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  fell the most
in two weeks after Chief Financial Officer Ed Barnes resigned
ahead of the carrier’s earnings report.  Barnes’s departure, effective immediately, was announced
after the stock market closed yesterday. The resignation was a
“personal decision” that had been planned for some time, said
Mateo Lleras, a spokesman for New York-based JetBlue.  The exit so close to JetBlue’s Oct. 26 third-quarter
results report raises questions about the circumstances, James M. Higgins, a Ticonderoga Securities LLC analyst, said in a
report today. The shares dropped 6.7 percent to $4.32 at the
close in  New York .  JetBlue offered assurances “that there are no accounting
or other irregularities,” said Higgins, who recommends buying
the stock. “Such a sudden and untimely departure of a senior
officer may well lead to near-term weakness in JetBlue shares,
but we have no reason to think there are problems that should
concern shareholders.”  Today’s percentage drop in the shares was the biggest since
Oct. 3. The stock has slid 35 percent this year, eighth-worst
among the 10 carriers in the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index.  The departure was amicable and Barnes, 46, “is going to
pursue other professional interests,” said Jenny Dervin, a
JetBlue spokeswoman. Barnes declined requests for interviews
through the company, she said.  Barnes was named interim CFO in 2007 during a series of
management changes that included Dave Barger replacing company
founder David Neeleman as chief executive officer. Barnes became
the permanent finance chief the next year. He joined JetBlue in
2006 and also served as finance vice president and principal
accounting officer.  Mark Powers, JetBlue treasurer and senior vice president,
was named interim finance chief. Powers, 57, joined JetBlue in
2006 as treasurer and vice president for corporate finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
