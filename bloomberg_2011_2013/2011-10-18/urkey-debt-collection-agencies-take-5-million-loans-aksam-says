Turkish banks sold some five million
uncollectable debts to collection agencies since 2007,  Aksam 
reported.  Out of 6.6 billion liras ($3.5 billion) in non-performing
loans sold to collection agencies, 52 percent were personal and
credit-card loans and 48 percent commercial loans, the Istanbul-
based newspaper said, citing Hasan Tengiz, general manager of
Girisim Varlik Yonetim AS, a debt collection agency.  Turkish banks still holds 18.6 billion liras in non-
performing loans, Aksam said.  Turkey  has eight regulator-
approved debt collection agencies that compete to purchase non-
performing loans at bank auctions, Aksam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
