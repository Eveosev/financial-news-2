Whole-milk powder auction prices
increased by the most in more than seven months, according to
Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the largest dairy exporter.  Powder for December delivery was $3,473 a metric ton from
$3,263 two weeks earlier, according to the companyâ€™s
 GlobalDairyTrade  auction. The near-term contract rose 6.1
percent from the Oct. 4 sale, according to a trade-weighted
 price index  from the company.  Whole-milk powder has slumped 30 percent since reaching a
record $4,958 a ton in March as high prices spurred farmers in
the U.S. and  New Zealand  to boost herds and output. Auckland-
based Fonterra earlier this month said favorable weather and
farm conditions were producing record early season milk flows
from New Zealand.  Fonterra, which accounts for about 40 percent of the global
trade in dairy products, sells whole and skim-milk powder,
dried-milk fat and casein at its GlobalDairyTrade auctions. The
company offers one-month contracts with delivery from two months
after the sale, and two three-month contracts with delivery
three and six months later. Casein is a protein found in milk.  Whole-milk powder for delivery from January to March
increased 6.7 percent, Fonterra said. Powder for shipment from
April to June gained 0.8 percent. Across all contracts, prices
rose 5.7 percent, the highest increase since March 1.  In other auctions, prices for December delivery of cheddar,
milk fat casein, milk-protein concentrate and butter milk powder
fell. Skim milk powder rose 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
