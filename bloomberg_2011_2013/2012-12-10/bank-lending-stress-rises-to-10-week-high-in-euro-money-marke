European banks’ reluctance to make
unsecured loans to one another rose to the highest in 10 weeks,
according to a money-market indicator.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was 14.4
basis points at 8:25 a.m. in  London  from 14.2 on Dec. 7, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The spread is the widest since Sept.
21.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars held near
the highest in more than a week. The three-month cross-currency
 basis swap  was 25.5 basis points below Euribor from minus 26 on
Dec. 7. The one-year basis swap was little changed at 26.5 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.072
percent on Dec. 7, unchanged from the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of overnight borrowing costs over the next
three months, was little changed at 4.2 basis points, the lowest
since July 30.  The  volume  of overnight lending as measured by the EBF in
Brussels fell to 14.6 billion euros ($18.8 billion) of
transactions on Dec. 7, the lowest since Nov. 1, from 15 billion
euros the day before. Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at
the  European Central Bank  on Dec. 7 to 235 billion euros from
230 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
