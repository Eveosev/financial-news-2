A $2.3 million water bill for the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre will be paid for by the Israel
government and  Jerusalem ’s municipality, Israel Today reported,
citing an agreement by Israeli authorities.  The deal is designed to end about eight years of
disagreement over the bill between the church and Jerusalem’s
Gihon Water Co., established by the municipality to gain better
control of water usage in the city. The church has now promised
to pay its water bills going forward, Israel Today said.  Ma’ariv newspaper said the compromise deal reached by the
church, Gihon and the Israeli government will see the church pay
its water bill for 2012 while the Jerusalem municipality will
cancel the debt from all previous years.  Gihon had taken legal action against church authoritiees
and threatened to shut off water to it unless the bill issue was
resolved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
