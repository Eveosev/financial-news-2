Islamic Corp. for the Development of
the Private Sector , the investment arm of the Saudi Arabia-based
 Islamic Development Bank , started a fund to finance renewable-
energy projects in Central Asia and plans another in Africa.  The $35 million Central Asian fund is based in Kazakhstan,
Islamic Corp.’s Chief Executive Officer Khalid al-Aboodi said
today in Manama, Bahrain. The North Africa fund, expected to be
about $35 million to $50 million in size, will open soon.  Financing for renewables ventures is flowing into  emerging
markets  as governments seek to curb reliance on fuel imports and
cash-strapped nations in  Europe  cut subsidies for clean power.
Morocco in September chose developers for a $1 billion solar
plant, while  France ’s Fonroche Energie said last month it will
build Kazakhstan’s largest photovoltaic complex for $70 million.  “We want to expand the size of the funds but we must start
small at first to test things in those regions,” Al-Aboodi said
in an interview. Both funds are Shariah-compliant, which means
they lend based on Islamic laws.  To contact the reporter on this story:
