International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA (IAG)  began the process of seeking to buy 100 percent of low-
cost carrier  Vueling Airlines SA (VLG)  by seeking authorization for a
tender offer from  Spain ’s National Securities Market Commission.  IAG, the parent of British Airways and Spain’s Iberia,
plans to acquire the 16.2 million shares of Barcelona-based
Vueling -- equal to 54.14 percent of the total -- that it
doesn’t already own, it said today in a statement.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  has agreed to guarantee 113.4 million
euros ($147 million) to cover the cost of the transaction, or 7
euros per share targeted, London-based IAG said.  Taking full ownership of Vueling may help IAG cut costs in
Spain after it began an overhaul of Iberia that includes the
foundation of a low-cost unit there. The company may face
opposition to the takeover plan, first disclosed on Nov. 8, from
shareholders who have said the offer price is too low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
