Dominique Strauss-Kahn  agreed to
settle a lawsuit filed by the maid who accused him of trying to
rape her, resolving a legal saga that ended his term as head of
the International Monetary Fund and derailed a potential French
presidential bid.  Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn and the hotel maid, Nafissatou
Diallo, told  New York  State Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon
in the Bronx today that they have reached an agreement to end
the suit, which accused the former IMF head of “violent and
deplorable acts” during an encounter at the Sofitel in midtown
Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
