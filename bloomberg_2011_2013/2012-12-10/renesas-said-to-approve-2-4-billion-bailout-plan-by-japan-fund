Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , the
ailing Japanese chipmaker, will sell at least 150 billion yen
($1.8 billion) of new shares to a government-backed fund and
customers such as Toyota Motor Corp. as part of a bailout plan.  A group led by  Innovation Network Corp. of Japan  will buy
1.25 billion shares for 120 yen apiece, and the government-
backed fund will own 69 percent of the Kawasaki, Japan-based
Renesas, the company said in a statement. That compares with
today’s closing price of 308 yen in Tokyo trading.  The capital will help Renesas, a supplier to  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and
Nintendo Co., boost spending to develop more advanced
microcontrollers used in cars and TVs. Japanese chipmakers have
struggled amid falling demand, the strong yen and competition
from  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , causing Elpida Memory Inc. to file
for  bankruptcy protection  in February before agreeing in July to
be acquired by Micron Technology Inc.  “The risk of bankruptcy is gone with this fresh capital,”
said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer at Myojo Asset
Management Japan Co., a Tokyo-based hedge advisory firm.
“Renesas must now fix its money-losing structure before
considering ways to boost revenue.”  Renesas may get an additional 50 billion yen of investment
or financing from INCJ if more funds are needed, according to
today’s statement. The chipmaker may eliminate as many as 5,000
positions and shut more factories under INCJ’s proposal, a
person familiar with the plan said last week.  Toyota, Nissan  A group of companies including  Toyota (7203) , Nissan Motor Co.,
 Denso Corp. (6902) ,  Keihin Corp. (7251) ,  Panasonic Corp. (6752) ,  Nikon Corp. (7731) ,  Yaskawa
Electric Corp. (6506)  and  Canon Inc. (7751)  will also invest in Renesas,
according to today’s statement. Toyota, Japan’s biggest
carmaker, will hold 2.5 percent of Renesas, it said.  Renesas President Yasushi Akao said today the company
recognizes the need for further restructuring and has received a
proposal on job cuts from INCJ. The two sides also will discuss
forming new management, he said.  Renesas is cutting jobs and considering closing or selling
plants as demand drops for its system LSI chips, used for
functions including processing TV images. The chipmaker plans to
increase its focus on the microcontroller business, which
accounted for 43 percent of Renesas’s sales last fiscal year.  The company plans to spend 40 billion yen to develop
microcontrollers and another 40 billion yen to develop
automotive semiconductors, it said in today’s statement.  Revenue Forecast  Renesas rose 3 percent to 308 yen in Tokyo trading,
trimming its decline this year to 35 percent.  The company has posted 177.6 billion yen in combined losses
since it was formed in 2010 through the merger of money-losing
chipmakers Renesas Technology Corp., a venture between Hitachi
and Mitsubishi Electric, and NEC Electronics Corp.  Renesas today cut its revenue forecast for the year ending
March 31 to 820 billion yen from a previous forecast of 868
billion yen. It maintained its net-loss forecast of 150 billion
yen, compared with last year’s loss of 62.6 billion yen.  The INCJ plan keeps Renesas, a key supplier to  Japan ’s
automakers, in domestic hands after KKR & Co., a New York-based
private-equity firm, was said in August to seek control of the
company. KKR offered Renesas’s main shareholders and lenders
about 100 billion yen, a person with knowledge of the matter
said at the time.  Lexus Microcontrollers  Renesas had a 27 percent share of the global market for
microcontrollers last year, according to researcher IHS iSuppli.
It controlled 42 percent of the market for microcontrollers used
in cars to run systems including airbags and brakes. A lack of
the components after last year’s record earthquake and tsunami
in Japan prompted automakers to shut factories.  Koji Endo, a Tokyo-based analyst at Advanced Research
Japan, estimates Toyota’s Lexus LS luxury sedan uses about 100
microcontrollers. Renesas’s microcontroller business has an
operating profit margin of at least 10 percent, the company said
in June.  Renesas said Sept. 28 it clinched loan contracts for about
200 billion yen with lenders including  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust
Holdings Inc. (8309)  The chipmaker said Oct. 16 it booked a one-time
charge of about 84 billion yen to cut about 7,500 jobs. The
company employed 42,800 as of March 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) ,  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  and  NEC Corp. (6701) 
currently own a combined 91 percent of Renesas.  Japan Air  Innovation Network Corp. was formed in 2009 to invest in
companies that support Japanese industry and has announced about
400 billion yen in planned spending on 31 projects, according to
its website.  The fund took a 70 percent stake in the liquid-crystal-
display venture formed this year by  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Toshiba Corp. (6502) 
and Hitachi, and spent $680 million for a 40 percent stake in
Landis+Gyr AG, a Swiss electronic-meter company majority-owned
by Toshiba.  The government-backed fund ETIC injected 350 billion yen
into bankrupt Japan Airlines Corp., which had filed for
bankruptcy with 2.32 trillion yen in liabilities in January 2010
-- the nation’s biggest bankruptcy of a non-financial company.  JAL returned to the stock market Sept. 19 in a 663 billion-
yen public offering after a two-year turnaround that transformed
it into the world’s most-profitable airline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
