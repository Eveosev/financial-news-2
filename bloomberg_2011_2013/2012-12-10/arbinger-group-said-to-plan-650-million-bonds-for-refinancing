Harbinger Group Inc. (HRG) , the holding
company run by hedge-fund manager  Philip Falcone , issued $700
million of bonds to refinance debt.  The company, which focuses on acquiring controlling stakes
in businesses, issued 7.875 percent notes due July 2019 to yield
694 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The offering was
marketed earlier this week for $650 million.  Proceeds will be used to refinance the company’s $500
million of 10.625 percent securities due November 2015,
Harbinger said in a Dec. 10 statement distributed by Business
Wire. The bonds traded at 106.3 cents on the dollar to yield 8.2
percent or 615 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries on Dec. 6, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Moody’s Investors Service graded the new bonds B3, six
levels below investment grade, the ratings company said in a
Dec. 10 statement. Deutsche Bank AG, Jefferies Group Inc., and
Macquarie Group Ltd. managed the sale for the New York-based
company, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
