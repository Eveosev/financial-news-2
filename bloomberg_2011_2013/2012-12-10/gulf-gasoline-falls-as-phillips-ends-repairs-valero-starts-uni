Gasoline and diesel on the Gulf
Coast declined as  Phillips 66 (PSX)  completed maintenance at its
Borger refinery and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  started a new
hydocracker unit at its Port Arthur plant.  Conventional gasoline , or CBOB, on the Gulf Coast dropped
0.75 cent to a discount of 25.5 cents a gallon to futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:54 p.m. The fuel has traded
below futures since Oct. 11.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the Gulf slid 1.5 cents to a
discount of 1.25 cents a gallon under Nymex heating oil futures.  Phillips began work at its 146,000-barrel-a-day Borger
refinery in Texas in late September after being delayed about 30
days. The maintenance included shutting two fluid catalytic
crackers and idling the entire plant in October, a person
familiar with operations said Dec. 5.  Valero said in its third-quarter earnings report it
expected the hydrocracker at its 310,000-barrel-a-day Port
Arthur, Texas, refinery to be operational this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
