China’s  stocks  rose the most among
Asian equity markets today as the  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  Index
jumped to a four-week high after factory output and retail sales
data beat economists’ estimates.  The Shanghai Composite climbed 1.1 percent to 2,083.77 at
the close, with trading volumes exceeding the 30-day average by
86 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Gansu Qilianshan
Cement Group Co. led a rally for industrial shares.  Bank of
Nanjing Co.  rose 2.4 percent after BNP Paribas SA increased its
stake. FAW Car Co. paced gains for automakers after industry
vehicle sales advanced to the highest in almost two years.  Stocks rose even as customs data today showed exports
expanded a lower-than-estimated 2.9 percent in November from a
year earlier. Industrial  production  climbed 10.1 percent last
month, while retail sales grew 14.9 percent, the statistics
bureau said yesterday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had a
median estimate of 9.8 percent growth in industrial production
and a 14.6 percent increase in  retail sales .  “The economic data really looks good and the export number
isn’t as important as industrial output, which contributes more
to the economic recovery,” said Wang Weijun, a strategist at
Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai. “Stocks will continue to
go up to reflect the improvement of economic fundamentals.”  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 1.1 percent to 2,271.05. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in Hong
Kong gained 0.5 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added
0.3 percent on Dec. 7.  Stock Slump  The Shanghai Composite advanced 4.1 percent last week, the
most in 13 months, after sinking to the lowest level since
January 2009 on Dec. 3. It has fallen 5.3 percent this year,
making it the worst-performing major market in Asia, as the
slowing economy hurt corporate earnings. The measure  trades  at
11.5 times reported earnings, compared with 10.8 set on Dec. 3,
the lowest since at least 1997, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Qilianshan Cement gained 1.3 percent to 9.82  yuan .  BBMG
Corp. (601992) , a Beijing-based cement maker, rose 3.8 percent to 7.06
yuan. Guangxi Liugong Machinery Co., a Chinese maker of
construction equipment, added 2.9 percent to 9.33 yuan.  Fixed-asset investment excluding rural households in the
first 11 months of the year rose 20.7 percent, the same pace as
in the January-October period, the statistics bureau reported
yesterday. Imports were unchanged from a year earlier in
November, the customs administration said today in Beijing. That
compared with a projection of 2 percent growth in a Bloomberg
News Survey.  “The Chinese economy is now in a sweet spot and can stay
in the sweet spot” through the first half of 2013, Lu Ting,
head of Greater  China  economics at Bank of America Corp. in Hong
Kong, said in a note. “The current macro backdrop should
bolster asset prices from equities to commodities.”  Bigger Stake  Bank of Nanjing jumped 2.4 percent to 8.26 yuan. BNP
Paribas increased its stake in the bank by 59.4 million shares
between Oct. 10 to Dec. 6, according to an exchange statement.  FAW, which makes cars in China with Volkswagen AG, advanced
3.8 percent to 6.91 yuan. SAIC Motor Corp., China’s largest
carmaker, added 1 percent to 14.86 yuan. Anhui Jianghuai
Automobile Co., a unit of the biggest light-truck exporter,
climbed 1 percent to 5.88 yuan.  Wholesale deliveries, including multipurpose and sport
utility vehicles, gained 8.8 percent to 1.46 million units last
month, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said in
a statement today. That beat the 1.42 million average estimate
of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  IPO Suspension  The China Securities Regulatory Commission has halted
approvals of initial public offerings for two months and will
probably extend the ban until at least February as it tries to
bolster stocks, the South China Morning Post reported, without
saying where it got the information from. IPOs won’t resume
before Chinese New Year in February, the report cited
unidentified bankers as saying.  Stock funds raised their positions in electronic and
property shares over the past three weeks, the China Securities
Journal reported today, citing market data. The stock position
of actively-managed Chinese funds increased 2.27 percentage
points as of Dec. 7 compared with the previous week, it said.  Thirty-day  volatility  on the  Shanghai  Composite was at 16.8
today, compared with this year’s average of 16.9, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
