Former Cy Young Award-winning
pitcher Zack Greinke signed with the  Los Angeles Dodgers , adding
to what might become Major League Baseball’s highest payroll.  Greinke, whose signing was announced on Twitter by Dodgers
co-owner  Magic Johnson , agreed on a six-year, $147 million
contract that would make the team’s 2013 payroll more than $220
million, according to the Los Angeles Times. The highest
opening-day payroll was $209.1 million for the  New York Yankees 
in 2008, according to USA Today’s sports salary database.  The contract with Greinke also is the richest for a right-
handed pitcher, surpassing the $127.5 million, six-season
package for Matt Cain with the San Francisco Giants, according
to CBSSports.com.  Having added South Korean left-handed pitcher Ryu Hyun-jin
yesterday in a six-year deal worth $36 million, the Dodgers have
taken on more than $600 million in salaries since the franchise
was purchased by Guggenheim Baseball Management in March,
according to the Times.  Greinke, a 29-year-old right-hander, went 15-5 with a 3.48
earned run average for the Los Angeles Angels and Milwaukee
Brewers last season.  The 2009 Cy Young Award winner as the best pitcher in the
American League with the Kansas City Royals, Greinke was 31-11
over the last two seasons and is  91-78  during his nine-year
major-league career, posting a 3.77 ERA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
