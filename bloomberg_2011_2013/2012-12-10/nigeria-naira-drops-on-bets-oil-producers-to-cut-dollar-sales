The naira depreciated the most in
more than a week after Nigeria’s central bank sold the smallest
amount of dollars in a month at an auction.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer declined 0.1
percent to 157.09 per dollar as of 3 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its biggest retreat on a closing basis since
Nov. 27. The naira has risen 3.3 percent this year, the second-
best performance among African currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sells dollars to lenders at
foreign currency auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays to help
manage the exchange rate. The regulator sold $66 million at its
auction today, the lowest since Nov. 12 sale.  “A slight depreciation” is expected in response to the
decline in central bank supply “but we have seen inflows which
would be supporting the naira,” Augustus Nwachukwu, analyst at
Lagos-based Stanbic IBTC Holdings Co., said by phone today.  The naira’s appreciation can be traced to tight monetary
conditions, improved supply of foreign exchange to the market by
oil companies and increased inflows from portfolio investors,
central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said Nov. 20, after the
regulator held its benchmark rate at a record-high 12 percent.  Inflation, which accelerated for the first time in four
months to 11.7 percent in October on widespread flooding of
farms, is still above the bank’s target of less than 10 percent  The yield on 16.39 percent naira debt due January 2022 rose
two basis points to 12.03 percent, according to Dec. 7 prices on
the website of the Lagos-based  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website. Borrowing costs on the nation’s $500
million of Eurobonds due January 2021 was little changed at
4.183 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated by 0.1 percent to 1.8935 a dollar
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
