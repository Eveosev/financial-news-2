Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.27 percent on Dec. 7 after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.27 percent and averaging 0.17 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from
February 2036 to November 2042. The purchases are the part of
the Fed’s program, which lasts through the end of the year, to
replace short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term
Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs.  The central bank plans to purchase from $1.5 billion to
$2.25 billion of securities today, according to the New York
Fed’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
