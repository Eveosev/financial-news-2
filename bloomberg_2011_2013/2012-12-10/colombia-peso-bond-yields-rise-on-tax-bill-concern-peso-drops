Colombia ’s peso-denominated bond
yields rose the most in a week amid concern a tax bill won’t be
approved by the nation’s legislature this month.  The yield on the 6 percent bonds due in April 2013 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.81 percent,
the biggest increase since Dec. 3, according to the central
bank. The price fell 0.028 centavo to 100.37 centavos per peso.  The tax bill, which includes a proposal to cut the levy on
foreigners’ bond profits to 14 percent from about 33 percent,
needs to be approved this month in Congress in order to come
into effect in 2013. Senator Juan Lozano who is a member of the
government’s coalition, told W Radio today that Congress needs
more time to debate the initiative, while Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  told reporters Colombia needs the tax bill.  “The noise surrounding the tax bill is creating some
doubts it will pass and that’s having an impact on bonds,” said
Daniel Escobar, the head analyst at Global Securities in Bogota.  The peso fell for the first time in five days, weakening
0.2 percent to 1,799.3 per  U.S. dollar . It has risen 7.7 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
