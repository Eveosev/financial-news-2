India ’s rupee rose toward a one-
month high before a report that economists predict will show
factory output in  Asia ’s third-largest economy rebounded.  Industrial production  climbed 5 percent in October from a
year earlier, after contracting 0.4 percent the previous month,
according to the median of 30 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey before data due Dec 12. Factory output in China gained
the most in eight months in November, adding to signs the
outlook for regional economies is improving. India also reports
trade and inflation numbers this week.  “Industrial output growth is likely to return to positive
territory,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior strategist at  Credit
Agricole  CIB in  Hong Kong , wrote in a research report today.
“While the  trade gap  will remain close to record highs,
overall, the numbers will be positive for the rupee.”  The currency ended little changed from Dec. 7 at 54.5050
per dollar in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rupee had earlier advanced as much as 0.4 percent to
54.2550. This was the strongest level since the one-month high
of 54.0450 touched Dec. 6.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 10.35 percent.  India’s  trade deficit  widened to a record $20.96 billion in
October as the slowdown in the world economy contributed to a
1.6 percent drop in exports. Industrial production in  China 
climbed 10.1 percent in November, a report showed yesterday,
faster than the 9.8 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Inflation Data  Credit Agricole predicts a report on Dec. 14 will show
 wholesale prices  in India “inched lower” in November, while a
Bloomberg survey forecasts the benchmark measure rose 7.60
percent, compared with 7.45 percent the previous month.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.45 per
dollar, compared with 55.39 on Dec. 7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.35 versus 55.33. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
