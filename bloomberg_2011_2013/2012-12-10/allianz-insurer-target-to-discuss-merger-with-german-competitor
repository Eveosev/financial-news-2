Provinzial Nordwest Holding AG, the
German insurer reported to be the target of a takeover bid by
 Allianz SE (ALV) , will discuss a merger with competitor Provinzial
Rheinland Versicherung AG.  Savings banks in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia
will suspend talks with other interested parties through the end
of March, according to a  statement  today from the Westphalia-
Lippe savings bank association. The lenders agreed to the talks
after meeting with Hannelore Kraft, the premier of the western
German state, according to the statement.  German newspaper Financial Times Deutschland reported Nov.
30 that Munich-based Allianz submitted an offer for Provinzial
Nordwest. A takeover by  Europe ’s largest insurer could threaten
6,000 Provinzial Nordwest jobs, according to German labor union
Ver.di, which organized protests against a deal last week.  Provinzial Nordwest is based in the German town of Muenster
and employs about 7,000 people serving more than 3 million
clients, according to its website. An acquisition would help
Allianz boost its market share in  Germany .  Westphalia-Lippe savings banks and the region’s investment
arm each own 40 percent of Provinzial Nordwest while the German
state of Schleswig-Holstein’s savings banks hold 18 percent and
the eastern German savings banks association own the remainder,
according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
