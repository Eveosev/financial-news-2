India ’s benchmark stock index fell
for a second day as some investors avoided taking fresh bets
before key economic data due this week.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, fell 0.1 percent
to 19,409.69 at the close. The gauge changed directions about 20
times and volumes in the measure were 13 percent below the 30-
day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software maker, dropped
to a four-month low.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the biggest mobile
services company, retreated to the lowest close in two weeks.  The government will announce factory production data for
October on Dec. 12, inflation figures for November on Dec. 14
and trade numbers by Dec. 15. The Sensex has risen 6.1 percent
in the past three weeks as data showing economic growth slowed
last quarter to match a three-year low stoked speculation the
government will take more steps to boost growth and investment.  “Markets are consolidating after three weeks of gains as
investors watch out for key economic data releases this week
that will determine further direction,” A.K. Prabhakar, senior
vice president at Mumbai-based Anand Rathi Financial Services
Ltd., said by telephone.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government on Dec. 7 won a
vote in parliament on allowing foreign investments in retailing,
fueling expectations it will move ahead with further reforms.
Singh plans to present to lawmakers plans to raise foreign
investment cap for the insurance sector, and allow foreigners to
buy stakes in pension firms for the first time.  ‘Boost Spirits’  Singh in mid-September opened aviation and retailing to
foreigners, and pared fuel subsidies in a wave of policy making
aimed at reviving economic growth and averting a downgrade of
India’s credit rating.  “With the FDI in retail out of the way, now the crucial
bills in question are banking, forward contract (regulations)
amendment and the pensions bill, which if passed will most
likely boost spirits,” Amar Ambani, head of research at  India
Infoline Ltd. (IIFL) , said by e-mail.  Tata Consultancy dropped 2.1 percent to 1,237.2 rupees, the
lowest close since Aug. 6. Bharti fell 1.4 percent to 317.9
rupees, the lowest price since Nov. 26.  Mortgage lender  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC)  rose 3.4
percent to 865.80 rupees, a record.  Sterlite Industries (India)
Ltd. (STLT) , the biggest copper maker, gained 0.8 percent to 113.95
rupees, erasing an intraday loss of 2.6 percent.  The 30-stock Sensex  trades  at 15.9 times estimated profit,
the highest since February, compared with the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index’s 11.8  multiple . The Indian measure’s 14-day
relative strength index, a measure of how rapidly prices rose or
fell during the period, has been above 70 for the past six
trading days, the level some traders use as a signal to sell.  ‘Attractive Opportunities’  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. rose less than 0.1 percent to 5,908.9. The broader
 BSE Mid-Cap Index (BSEMDCAP)  added 0.7 percent to 7,116.60, the highest
level since April 28, 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
246-member  measure  trades at 14.2 times estimated earnings. The
NSE CNX Smallcap Index rose 0.3 percent to 3,742.90 for the 13th
day, its longest winning run since January 2004.  “Investor focus is beginning to increasingly shift to mid-
and-small caps,” Deven Choksey, managing director at K.R.
Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. in Mumbai, said by telephone.
“There are a lot of attractive opportunities in that space.”  Overseas funds  bought  about $393 million of Indian stocks
on Dec. 6, taking net purchases in 2012 to $20.9 billion, the
most among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding
 China , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
