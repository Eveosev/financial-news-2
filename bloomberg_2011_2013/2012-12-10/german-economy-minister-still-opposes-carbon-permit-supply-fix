Germany ’s Economy Ministry remains
opposed to a European Union plan to curb an oversupply of
allowances in the world’s biggest emissions-trading market by
delaying the sale of some carbon permits from next year.  While Environment Minister  Peter Altmaier  supports the
proposal by the European Commission to delay auctions of 900
million carbon permits starting in 2013 after the price of
allowances sank to a record in April, Economy Minister Philipp Roesler still opposes such a move, his spokesman said today in
Berlin.  At stake is the price of emission permits, which plunged to
a record 5.99 euros ($7.73) in April as the economic crisis hurt
industrial output. The downturn boosted the surplus of
allowances to almost half of the average annual pollution limit
in the 27-nation EU.  Roesler “has made it clear that, for him, a reduction in
emissions rights is out of the question,” as it may hurt the
domestic economy and jobs, Holger Schlienkamp, the minister’s
spokesman, told a regular government news conference.  The conflict raises uncertainty over the fate of the
measure aimed at supporting prices in the world’s biggest
emissions market. If the German government fails to reach a
joint position,  Europe ’s biggest polluter may abstain in any
voting on the issue and therefore fail to back the proposal,
Roesler’s ministry said last month.  Both ministries remain in talks and Altmaier will
“advocate that there will be an agreement,” Frauke Stamer, a
spokeswoman for the environment minister, told the same news
conference.  EU Climate Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard  has said she aims
for a decision on the measure before the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
