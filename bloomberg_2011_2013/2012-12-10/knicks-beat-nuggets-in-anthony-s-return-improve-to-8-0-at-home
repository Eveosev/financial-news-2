The New York Knicks improved to 8-0
at home this season by beating the Denver Nuggets 112-106 in
Carmelo Anthony’s return after missing the past two games with a
lacerated middle finger on his left hand.   Anthony scored 34 points last night at New York’s Madison
Square Garden, where the Knicks outscored the Nuggets 32-22 in
the fourth quarter to erase a four-point deficit.   Jason Kidd  added 17 points and seven rebounds for the
Knicks, whose unbeaten home start is their best since winning
their first nine games at Madison Square Garden in 1992-93.   Tyson Chandler  had 15 points and 12 rebounds for New York
(15-5), which opened a 3 1/2-game lead over the second-place
Brooklyn Nets in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division. The
Nets lost their fourth straight game yesterday, falling to 11-8
with a 97-88 home defeat against the Milwaukee Bucks.    The Oklahoma City Thunder pushed their winning streak to
eight games with a 104-93 win over the  Indiana Pacers , tying the
San Antonio Spurs for the NBA’s best record. In yesterday’s
other NBA games, the  Los Angeles Clippers  beat the Toronto
Raptors 102-83, the Orlando Magic topped the Phoenix Suns 98-90
and the Utah Jazz sent the Los Angeles Lakers to their seventh
loss in 10 games, winning 117-110.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
