Drivers in  Australia  were stranded
in a national park in Victoria state for a day without food and
water after being led astray by  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone mapping
application, according to police.  Maps on iPhones with the iOS 6 operating system list the
northwestern Victorian city of Mildura in the middle of the
Murray Sunset National Park about 70 kilometers (44 miles) away,
state police said today in a  statement . In some cases, motorists
were stuck for as long as a day and walked long distances to get
phone reception, police said.  “Police are extremely concerned as there is no water
supply within the park and temperatures can reach as high as 46
degrees (115 degrees Fahrenheit), making this a potentially
life-threatening issue,” according to the statement.  E-mails seeking comment from Carolyn Wu and Fiona Martin,
spokeswomen for Apple in Beijing and Sydney, respectively, were
not immediately returned.  Apple Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  apologized in
September for the map software that has been criticized for
flaws including misrouted directions and inaccurately located
landmarks.  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s maps were on previous iPhone models.  “We are extremely sorry for the frustration this has
caused our customers and we are doing everything we can to make
Maps better,” Cook said in a letter to customers posted on the
Cupertino, California-based company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
