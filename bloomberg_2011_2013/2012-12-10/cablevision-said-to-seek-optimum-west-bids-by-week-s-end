Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , seeking a
buyer for its Optimum West unit, may get an offer from  Charter
Communications Inc. (CHTR)  after asking for first-round bids by the end
of the week, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  Cablevision has hired Bank of America Corp. and Guggenheim
Securities LLC as advisers, said another person, who asked not
to be named because the process is private. Cablevision was
already working with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. on
the possible sale, people said last month.  Bloomberg News reported in October that Cablevision was
exploring the sale of Optimum West, known as Bresnan Broadband
Holdings LLC at the time of its $1.37 billion purchase two years
ago. Optimum West offers cable service to about 300,000
customers in states such as  Montana , Wyoming, Colorado and  Utah .  Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge, who served as
operations chief at Cablevision during the Bresnan purchase,
 told CNBC  this month he still liked the Optimum West assets.
Officials at Charter, Cablevision and Guggenheim declined to
comment.  Cablevision shares fell 0.2 percent to $14.32 at the close
in New York. Charter dropped almost 1 percent to $69.76.  A representative at Bank of America didn’t immediately
return calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
