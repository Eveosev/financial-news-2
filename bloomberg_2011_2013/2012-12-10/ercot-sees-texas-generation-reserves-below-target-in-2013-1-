Power-generation reserves in  Texas 
are forecast to be below the state’s target for the summer of
2013, increasing the risk of blackouts during the hottest days,
the state’s grid operator said.  Reserves are expected to be at 13.2 percent for the summer
of 2013, below the 13.75 percent target, the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas said in a report  posted  on its
website today. ERCOT, which serves 85 percent of the state’s
power demand, said reserves will drop to 10.9 percent in the
summer of 2014.  “The projected reserve margin for summer 2013 has dropped
slightly since May, but we are seeing healthier reserve margins
in future years,” ERCOT Chief Executive Officer Trip Doggett
said in an e-mailed statement. The grid operator used a more
conservative economic report than in its May forecast as growth
has slowed recently, ERCOT said.  New power plants under construction may push reserves to
13.6 percent, slightly below the target if they come online by
August 2014, ERCOT said. In 2015, generation reserves are
forecast at 10.5 percent.  Texas regulators are considering changes to the power
market to spur construction of additional power plants including
adding so-called capacity payments, in which generators are paid
to make sure their units are available to meet peak demand. In
October, the Public Utility Commission of Texas voted to
increase the price cap for wholesale electricity through 2015.  Fuels Debate  The report is positive for  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)  and  Calpine
Corp. (CPN)  as the projected reserve shortfall fuels debate about
capacity payments, Julien Dumoulin-Smith, a New York-based
analyst for UBS Securities LLC, wrote in a research note today.  NRG, the second-largest generation owner in Texas, rose
1.4 percent to $22.18 at the close in New York. Calpine, the
third-largest generation owner, rose 0.6 percent to $17.49.  “One of the potential repercussions to look for will be
whether or not the report stimulates a policy change regarding
market design at the PUC,” Paul Patterson, a New York-based
utility analyst for Glenrock Associates LLC, said in an
interview.  Closely held Energy Future Holdings Corp. is the largest
generation owner in Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
