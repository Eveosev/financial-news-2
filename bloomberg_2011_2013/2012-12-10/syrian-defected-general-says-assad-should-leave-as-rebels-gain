Syrian Brigadier General Manaf Tlas,
who defected in July, urged President Bashar al-Assad to step
down, saying: “It’s over.”  In an interview with Dubai TV yesterday from Paris, Tlas
said Assad, his childhood friend, refused to listen to his
appeals to back Syrians’ demands for change. Assad would avoid
responding directly and often said the uprising in  Syria  was a
conspiracy and the rebels were armed gangs, according to Tlas.  A small circle of family members, security agencies and
people benefiting from the government persuaded Assad that
clamping down on protesters would lead to the end of the
uprising that began in March 2011, Tlas said.  “They want to drag Syria to destruction and only care
about staying in power,” he said in the interview. The uprising
will be “victorious soon” and Assad should “leave,” he said.  Tlas also urged the Syrian army and institutions to
disengage from the Assad administration and troops not to open
fire on civilians.  Tlas, a Sunni Muslim like the overwhelming majority of the
rebels, was a confidant of Assad, who is from the Alawite sect,
an offshoot of Shiite Islam. He’s the son of ex-Defense Minister
Mustapha Tlas and was a commander in the elite Republican Guard
when he defected.  In the interview, Tlas said he left the country because he
was in danger of being killed. He urged Syria’s disparate
opposition groups to work together and offer guarantees to
minorities, including Christians and Alawites, that they have a
place in a post-Assad Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
