Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  is leading a group
of investors that plan to build a methanol-to-petrochemicals
complex in Trinidad, the Trinidad and Tobago Guardian newspaper
reported today, citing Energy Minister Kevin Ramnarine.  The group, which also consists of  Mitsubishi Gas Chemicals
Co. (4182) , ICCL of the U.S. and local company  Neal & Massy Holdings
Ltd. (NML) , will invest $850 million in the first phase of the
project, the newspaper said. The complex will be based on a 50-
hectare (123.6 acres) site near the town of La Brea, in
southwestern Trinidad, the paper said.  The project will require 100 million standard cubic feet
per day of natural gas and will produce among other products di-
methyl ether, which is used as a substitute for propane and
diesel, the Guardian said. The first stage of the complex may
start as early as the last quarter of 2013, the newspaper said,
citing Ramnarine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
