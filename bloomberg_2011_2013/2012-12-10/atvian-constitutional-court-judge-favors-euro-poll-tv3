Latvia should allow a non-binding
vote next June, when it will hold municipal elections, on
adopting the euro in 2014, Constitutional Court Chairman Gunars
Kutris told TV3 television in an interview.  “There will be municipal elections,” Kutris said late
yesterday on TV3’s Neka Personiga  program , according to an e-
mailed transcript. “A survey can be organized for that same
money. One additional page, but the question is only, is there a
wish to organize it.”  Kutris said he favors a non-binding vote like Sweden held
in 2003 on euro adoption, whose results were indicative and not
legally enforceable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
