Ancestry.com Inc. (ACOM) , the family-
history website being purchased by Permira Advisers LLP, issued
$300 million of bonds to help fund the buyout even as a court
ruled that officials can’t close the deal for now.  The company issued 11 percent, eight-year notes at par to
yield 964 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors had been told
last week the bonds may yield 10.5 to 10.75 percent, according
to a person familiar with the transaction who asked not to be
identified because the terms weren’t set.  Permira, a London-based private equity firm, agreed to buy
Ancestry.com in a transaction valued at about $1.6 billion,
according to an Oct. 22 statement. Ancestry.com, which said in a
July statement that it passed the 2 million-user milestone,
sought a deal amid concerns that the cancellation of a
television show featuring its research, “Who Do You Think You
Are?” would crimp subscriber growth.  Ancestry.com officials can’t proceed with the sale to
Permira until it discloses more information about the deal
before a Dec. 27 shareholder vote, Delaware Chancery Court Judge
Leo Strine ruled today.  The bonds are graded CCC+ by  Standard & Poor’s , the ratings
company said in a Dec. 3 report.  The Provo, Utah-based company is also planning a new $720
million senior secured credit facility, according to the S&P
report. The financing will include a $670 million, seven-year
term loan B and a $50 million, five-year revolving line of
credit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
