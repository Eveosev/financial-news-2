(Corrects date in second paragraph.)  A cyclist who was injured in an
accident in Beijing died en route to the hospital after vehicles
in rush-hour traffic didn’t yield to the ambulance carrying him,
the  Beijing Evening News  reported.  The victim, a man in his 50s, was critically injured after
a collision with a heavy truck in west Beijing on Dec. 7,
according to the newspaper. The ambulance crew performed
emergency resuscitation and was transporting him to the nearest
hospital about 3 kilometers (2 miles) away when they encountered
heavy traffic, the newspaper reported, citing the accompanying
doctor surnamed Wang.  The journey took 40 minutes because all but four vehicles
yielded to the ambulance despite repeated sounding of the siren,
the newspaper reported. Most motorists also didn’t give way when
the ambulance driver tried to get back in line after trying the
bicycling lane and finding the path blocked by an illegally
parked car, according to the report.  Beijing’s municipal government said in August it plans to
build a system for imposing road-congestion charges on
motorists, adding to caps on vehicle registrations as  China ’s
capital seeks to ease traffic jams.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
