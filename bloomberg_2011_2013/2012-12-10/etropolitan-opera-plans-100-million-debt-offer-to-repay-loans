New York City ’s  Metropolitan Opera 
Association, the largest U.S. performing arts organization,
plans to sell $100 million of taxable debt to end a swap
agreement and repay loans from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The group, founded in 1883, is selling debt for the first
time, said Eric Wild, a managing director in the public finance
group at New York-based Morgan Stanley, which is managing the
sale.  Lee Abrahamian, a Met spokeswoman, referred questions about
the sale to Morgan Stanley.  Proceeds will pay down two Bank of America loans totaling
about $63.2 million and end an interest-rate swap agreement with
the bank, according to bond documents. Terminating the swap 
cost $2.6 million as of July 31, according to the offering 
statement.  The funds will also pay operating expenses, according to
bond documents. The bonds, set to be sold as soon as Dec. 13,
will be sold as taxable securities in the corporate market
because of that use, Wild said.  Moody’s Investors Service rates the sale A3, its seventh-
highest grade. Standard & Poor’s rates the debt one level higher
at A.  The Met is one of the largest opera houses in the world,
with more than 200 performances a season. With a 2013 operating
budget of $329 million, it has 1,600 full-time and seasonal
employees, plus 1,800 part-time workers, according to the bond
documents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
