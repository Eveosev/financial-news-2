ANRE,  Romania ’s energy market
regulator, seeks to keep  Transelectrica SA (TEL) ’s tariffs for
electricity transport unchanged at 18.77 lei ($5.4) per megawatt
hour in 2013, according to a document published on the
regulator’s website.  ANRE also also said it plans to revise the tariffs of the
country’s power-grid operator in July next year.  “The document is under public consultation and we’ll take
a decision on the tariffs by the end of the month,” said
Niculae Havrilet, the head of ANRE in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
