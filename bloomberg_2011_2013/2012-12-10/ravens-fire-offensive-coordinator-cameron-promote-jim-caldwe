The Baltimore Ravens fired offensive
coordinator Cam Cameron and replaced him with quarterbacks coach
 Jim Caldwell , a day after the team scored seven second-half
points in a 31-28 overtime loss to the Washington Redskins.  Cameron, 51, was in his fifth season with Baltimore, which
ranks fourth in the 16-team American Football Conference with
25.5 points a game and has lost consecutive regular-season
contests for the first time since 2009.  “Our responsibility as a coaching staff is to maximize the
opportunities for our team to win, and we can still reach all of
our goals for this season,” Ravens coach  John Harbaugh  said in
a statement. “We have a motto we follow on this team: W.I.N. --
What’s Important Now -- and what’s important now is to find ways
to get better, win the AFC North and advance to the playoffs.”  The Ravens held a 21-14 halftime lead against the Redskins
yesterday, but gained just 149 yards in the second half, with
turnovers on their first two possessions.  Caldwell, 57, joined the Ravens after being fired as coach
of the  Indianapolis Colts  following a 2-14 season. Caldwell was
quarterbacks coach of the Colts from 2002 to 2007, helping
Peyton Manning win two league Most Valuable Player awards.  The Ravens (9-4) are first in the AFC North division. The
team has made the playoffs five of the past six seasons without
reaching the  Super Bowl .  To contact the reporter on this story:
