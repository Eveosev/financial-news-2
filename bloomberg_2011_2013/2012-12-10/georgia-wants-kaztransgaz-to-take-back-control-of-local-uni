Georgia  wants KazTransGaz,
Kazakhstan’s state natural-gas shipping monopoly, to take back
control of its local unit.  Talks for the Kazakh company to resume its leadership of
OOO KazTransGaz Tbilisi took place in November, according to
Mariam Valishvili, Georgia’s deputy energy and natural resources
minister.  “We expect some solution of this problem,” she said today
by phone. The Georgian government wants the Kazakh company to
pay off debt owed by its local unit, she said.  Georgia’s energy regulator installed a new chief executive
officer at KazTransGaz Tbilisi in March 2009, the Astana-based
company said at the time, without giving a reason. KazTransGaz
said it has invested $100 million in the Tbilisi unit since
buying the then-bankrupt Tbilgaz retailer from the Georgian
government in 2006.  KazTransGaz Tbilisi’s $50 million debt to Georgia may be
settled by writing off the Caucasian state’s debt to  Kazakhstan ,
Energy and Natural Resources minister Kakha Kaladze said last
month, according to Interfax.  Murat Kozhamkulov, a spokesman for KazTransGaz, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
