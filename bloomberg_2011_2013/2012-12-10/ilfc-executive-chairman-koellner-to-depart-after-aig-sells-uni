Laurette Koellner, the executive
chairman of  American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s plane-leasing
business, will step down once AIG’s sale of the unit is
approved, a spokesman said.  Koellner, 58, was named executive chairman of New York-
based AIG’s International Lease Finance Corp. in June after
Chief Executive Officer Henri Courpron was investigated over a
relationship with an employee. Courpron, 49, and other ILFC
executives will remain at the firm, Paul Thibeau, the ILFC
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Koellner’s planned departure was reported earlier today by
Dow Jones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
