German electricity for delivery in
2013 recovered from a record low as European Union emissions
permits erased earlier declines.  German power for 2013 was unchanged at 45.95 euros ($59.41)
a megawatt-hour at 5:30 p.m. in Berlin after falling 0.7 percent
to a record low of 45.65 euros, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg.  EU carbon permits for December were up 1.6 percent at 6.89
euros a metric ton after dropping 3.8 percent to 6.52 euros on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . Power can track
emissions prices, which affect production costs at plants which
burn fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal.  The German  2013 clean-dark spread , a measure of the profit
utilities get from selling electricity after accounting for the
cost of coal and emissions permits, was 0.8 percent lower at
9.78 euros a megawatt-hour at 5:30 p.m. Berlin time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 2013  clean-spark spread , for
gas-fed generators, increased 2.7 percent to minus 12.63 euros a
megawatt-hour.  RWE AG (RWE)  halted its 1,288-megawatt Gundremmingen-C nuclear
reactor today, without specifying a reason, it said on its
website. The unit will become operational on Dec. 17, the
company said.  The low temperature in  Frankfurt  may fall to minus 8
degrees Celsius (18 Fahrenheit) on Dec. 13, compared with
todayâ€™s plus 2 degrees, and a 10-year average of zero degrees,
according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
