Doosan Heavy Industries &
Construction Co. (034020) , a South  Korea  power equipment maker, said
today that it signed a 1.1 trillion won ($1.2 billion) contract
to build a power and desalination plant in Saudi Arabia.  The signing with Saline Water Conversion Corp. to build the
facility in the Red Sea port of Yanbu confirmed details of a
letter of agreement from last month.  The Saline Water Conversion Corp. awarded a $3 billion
contract to a group of companies led by  Samsung Engineering Co. (028050) ,
Korea’s largest industrial plant builder, to build a power plant
in Yanbu, 350 kilometers (220 miles) north of the country’s
second-largest city of Jeddah as part of a five-year, $400
billion stimulus package announced in late 2008.  Saudi Arabia, the largest oil producer with the Arab
world’s biggest economy, is building power stations to cope with
growing demand and desalination plants to supply drinking water
to lessen the country’s reliance on oil exports.  State-owned National Water Co. plans to spend $66 billion
on
plants and upgrades over the next 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
