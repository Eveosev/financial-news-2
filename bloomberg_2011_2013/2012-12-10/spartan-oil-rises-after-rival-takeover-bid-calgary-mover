Spartan Oil Corp. (STO)  gained the most in
nine months after the Canadian oil producer received a rival
offer to its planned C$356 million ($360 million) acquisition by
 Pinecrest Energy Inc. (PRY)   Spartan rose 8.4 percent to C$4.77 at 12:09 p.m. in
Toronto. Earlier the shares jumped 11 percent, the most intraday
since Feb. 9.  Spartan is considering the unsolicited offer, the Calgary-
based company said in a statement today. It didn’t disclose the
bidder or the terms. Spartan and Pinecrest announced an all-
stock deal Nov. 21 then worth C$427 million, or C$5.12 a share,
which didn’t offer a premium for Spartan shareholders.  A C$12.5 million breakup fee would provide “some
consolation” if Spartan chooses a rival bidder, Pinecrest Chief
Financial Officer Dan Toews told Bloomberg First Word in a phone
interview. The board is scheduled to meet today to discuss the
development, he said.  Pinecrest, which has fallen about 14 percent since the day
before the deal was announced, “remains committed to
completing” the deal, the Calgary-based company said in a
separate statement.  Pinecrest promised to initiate an annual dividend of 15.5
cents a share following the Spartan takeover and a 3-for-1 share
consolidation. Pinecrest gained 2.6 percent today to C$1.60.  Spartan holds acreage and production in the Cardium oil
field in  Alberta ’s Pembina area, where drilling results have
been predictable enough to support a dividend, Pinecrest Chief
Executive Officer L. Wade Becker said in a Nov. 21 telephone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
