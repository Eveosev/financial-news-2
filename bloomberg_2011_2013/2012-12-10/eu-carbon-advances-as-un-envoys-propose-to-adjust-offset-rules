European Union carbon permits for
December advanced to the highest in more than three weeks as
traders favored the contracts over United Nations offsets, the
use of which is being restricted.  “European Union allowances have become the gold standard
of EU compliance units,” Lisa DeMarco, a partner with Norton
Rose LLP in Toronto, said today in an e-mailed response to
questions.  EU contracts for December rose 4.3 percent to close at 7.07
euros ($9.15) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the highest since Nov. 15.  UN envoys proposed to limit nations including Japan and  New
Zealand ’s ability to use offsets for compliance with their own
targets after this year. Developing nations wanted to encourage
steeper emission cuts by rich nations and prodded them to join
the extension of the  Kyoto Protocol  through 2020. Canada, Japan,
New Zealand and Russia instead opted out.  UN Certified Emission Reduction credits for December next
year rose 2 cents to 70 cents, after opening at a record low 55
cents a ton on ICE.  The climate talks in Doha did not improve the chance of
increased global ambition to cut heat-trapping gases, said
 Trevor Sikorski , an analyst at Barclays Plc in London.  “The debate is exactly where it was before Doha started,”
he said today by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
