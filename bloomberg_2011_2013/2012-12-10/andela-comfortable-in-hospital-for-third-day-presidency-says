Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s first
black president and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, spent a
third day in a Pretoria hospital undergoing more medical tests.  “President Nelson Mandela had a good night’s rest,” the
Presidency said in an e-mailed statement today. “He is in good
hands.”  Mandela, 94, was admitted to the hospital on Dec. 8 for
tests for an undisclosed medical condition. President Jacob Zuma
visited Mandela yesterday and found him in “good care,”
according to a statement from his office yesterday.  “He is comfortable and there is no cause for alarm,” Mac Maharaj, Zuma’s spokesman, said in a phone interview. The
government has declined to disclose details of the hospital
where Mandela is receiving treatment to prevent a “buildup of
crowds outside,” Maharaj said.  Mandela underwent exploratory surgery for an abdominal
complaint in February and was hospitalized a year before that
for an acute respiratory infection. After spending 27 years in
prison for fighting against white minority rule, he helped
negotiate a peaceful end to apartheid, taking office after the
first all-race elections in 1994. He stepped down as president
voluntarily in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
