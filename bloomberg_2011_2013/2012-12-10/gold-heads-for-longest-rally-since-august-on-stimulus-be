Gold futures rose for a third day,
the longest rally in more than three months, amid speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will announce more bond purchases to
spur the  U.S. economy .  Policy makers meeting tomorrow and Dec. 12 are considering
whether to step up record stimulus as the Fed’s so-called
Operation Twist program of swapping short-term Treasuries for
long-term debt expires this month. Gold hasn’t risen for three
straight sessions since Aug. 27.  “A lot of people are looking at the next Fed meeting, and
the talk is that they’ll announce that they’re going to increase
their bond-purchase program,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity
broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for February delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,714.40 an ounce at 1:35 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York .  The price has advanced 9.4 percent this year, heading for
the 12th consecutive annual gain, after central banks from the
U.S. to  China  pledged to bolster their economies.  Holdings in  exchange-traded products  backed by the metal
gained 1.9 metric tons to a record 2,629.2 tons on Dec. 7, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$33.377 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery gained 1 percent to $1,623.30 an ounce, capping
a fourth straight gain.  Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 1 percent to
$704.75 an ounce. Last week, the price rose 1.4 percent, the
sixth straight increase and the longest rally since November
2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
