Taiwan dollar forwards touched the
strongest level in a week after data signaled  China ’s economic
recovery is gathering pace, brightening the outlook for the
island’s exports.  Government bonds  were steady.  Industrial production in  Asia ’s biggest economy climbed
10.1 percent in November from a year earlier and retail-sales
growth accelerated to 14.9 percent, the statistics bureau said
yesterday. Both figures topped economists’ estimates in separate
Bloomberg surveys. Global funds bought $26.1 million more
Taiwanese shares than they sold today, adding to last week’s net
purchases of $897 million and boosting this year’s inflows to
$4.2 billion, according to exchange data.  “It’s a modestly risk-on day in Asia today,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.
“China is the region’s main export destination, so improvement
in China should boost sentiment.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$29.07 per dollar as of 4:03 p.m. in Taipei, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. They reached NT$29.00 earlier, the
highest level since Dec. 3. The contracts are at a 0.3 percent
premium to the spot rate, which slipped 0.1 percent to NT$29.15,
based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, dropped two basis
points basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3 percent.  Taiwan ’s exports rose 0.9 percent in November from a year
earlier, after dropping in seven of the previous eight months,
official data showed Dec. 7. That compares with the 7.8 percent
growth economists forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Bond Sales  Taiwan’s treasury administration forecast future government
bond issuances will “frequently” exceed NT$610 billion ($21
billion), following NT$665 billion in 2012, according to two
people invited to a Dec. 14 meeting between the authority, the
central bank, and primary dealers.  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 was steady at 1.138 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The overnight  interbank lending rate  was
little changed at 0.386 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
