Russian President Vladimir Putin
defended keeping Vladimir Lenin’s body in a mausoleum in
Moscow’s Red Square amid criticism from the Orthodox church.  Religious figures including Vsevolod Chaplin, head of the
Orthodox church’s department for interaction between society and
the state, have said that keeping the corpse contradicts Russian
cultural tradition.  In comments yesterday to a  meeting  of supporters, Putin
compared keeping Lenin’s embalmed body in the Russian capital to
housing the remains of “holy people” in churches.  To contact the reporters on this story:
