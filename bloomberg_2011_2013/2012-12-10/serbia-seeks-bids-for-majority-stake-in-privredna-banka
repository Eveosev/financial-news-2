Serbia is seeking bids for a
majority stake in  Privredna Banka Beograd AD (PRBN) , one of three
state-owned banks that received government aid this year.  The government owns 64.8 percent of the Belgrade-based
bank, which had 254.9 million euros ($329 million) of assets and
a 1 percent share in the local market at the end of September,
according to an announcement published in the newspaper Politika
today. Potential buyers can place preliminary bids by Dec. 27.  Its shares closed unchanged at 60 dinars on Dec. 7, valuing
the unprofitable lender at 150 million dinars.  Last week, the government decided to look for an investor
to take over assets and liabilities of  Razvojna Banka Vojvodine
AD (MTBN) , just weeks after passing a law that allowed the state to
merge collapsed Agrobanka AD with  Postanska Stedionica Banka AD. (PSBN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
