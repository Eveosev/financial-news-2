Italian industrial  output  declined
more than forecast in October, as the country’s fourth recession
since 2001 extended into a second year.  Output fell 1.1 percent from September, when it dropped a
revised 1.3 percent, national statistics office  Istat  said in
Rome today. Economists forecast a decline of 0.3 percent for
October, according to the median of 20 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  Italy ’s economy shrank less than economists forecast in the
quarter through September. Still, as export growth fails to
offset weak domestic demand, the contraction is deepening and a
“very negative context” marks the final quarter of the year,
business lobby Confindustria said in a report last month.  Consumer confidence  declined in November to the lowest
since records began in 1996 amid rising pessimism among
households on the outlook for growth and jobs. The Italian
economy will shrink 2.3 percent this year and won’t start
recovering until the second half of 2013, Istat said Nov. 5.  That consumer pessimism is translating into slumping car
sales, sapping earnings at  Fiat SpA (F) , the nation’s biggest
manufacturer. Car sales in Italy declined 20 percent in
November. Production of cars and other vehicles fell 26.8
percent from a year earlier and was down 20.6 percent in the
first 10 months, Istat said today.  Production dropped 6.2 percent from a year earlier on a
workday-adjusted basis, Istat said. Istat originally reported a
September decline in production of 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
