  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) ’s board
scheduled a 2-for-1 stock split as optimism about the company’s
experimental hepatitis C drug pushed shares to record highs.  Stockholders on Jan. 7, will receive an additional share,
Gilead said today in a statement. The split will increase the
number of outstanding common shares to 1.5 billion, the Foster
City, California-based company said. After such an action, a
company’s stock usually trades at half as much per share as
before the division.  Gilead, the world’s largest maker of HIV medicines, rose
less than 1 percent to $74.25 at the close in New York before
the split was announced. The company’s shares closed at $76.12
on Nov. 23, the highest level since Gilead first offered stock
in 1992, as its experimental drugs to treat hepatitis C have
shown to be effective and safe in clinical trials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
