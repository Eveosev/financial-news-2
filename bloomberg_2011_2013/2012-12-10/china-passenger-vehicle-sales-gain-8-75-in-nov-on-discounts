Chinese monthly passenger-vehicle
sales rose to the highest in almost two years, beating analyst
estimates, as  consumer confidence  improved with the economy and
dealerships increased discounts to reduce stockpiles.  Wholesale deliveries, including multipurpose and sport
utility vehicles, gained 8.75 percent to 1.46 million units last
month, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said in
a statement today. That beat the 1.42 million units average
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Buyers are stepping up auto purchases as dealerships
increase discounts to reduce inventory at the end of the year,
according to industry researcher IHS Automotive. China’s growth
rebound gathered pace in November, with retail sales gaining the
most since March and  industrial production  accelerating for a
third month.  “There’s still strong pent-up demand,” said Ivo Naumann,
Shanghai-based managing director at consulting company
AlixPartners. “If you wanted originally to buy a car in March
and you didn’t buy because you weren’t sure about the economy,
now seven, eight months later, at some point you want to have
your car.”  Total sales of vehicles, including trucks and buses, rose
8.2 percent to 1.79 million units last month. In January 2011,
1.53 million units of passenger vehicles were sold.  Next Year  Sales of SUVs jumped 18 percent last month to 189,200
units, maintaining its streak as the fastest-growing segment in
the world’s largest auto market. In the first 11 months, SUV
sales climbed 26 percent to 1.79 million units, compared with a
7.1 percent gain to 14 million in total passenger-vehicle sales.  Commercial-vehicle deliveries gained 5.6 percent to 329,700
units last month. Total vehicle inventory fell by 2.8 percent in
November from the prior month to 777,500 units, the association
said.  Total vehicle sales may exceed 19 million units this year,
the association said. December auto sales should be “ideal,”
judging from the momentum gained in November, Chen Shihua, the
association’s head of statistics, said at a news conference
today.  Sales Forecast  China  passenger car sales will increase about 10 percent
next year, according to Xu Changming, director of information
resource development at the State Information Center, part of
the nation’s top economic planning body, at a car dealership
conference on Nov. 29.  Industrial production climbed 10.1 percent in November from
a year earlier and retail sales growth accelerated to 14.9
percent, both beating analysts’ estimates, while inflation was 2
percent, according to figures from the statistics bureau
yesterday.  China’s benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 4.1 percent
last week, the most in a year, on expectations the economic
recovery will gather pace and as the Politburo signaled an
increased focus on urban development.  Japanese-brand sales rebounded in November to account for
11.7 percent of market share, an increase of 4 percentage points
from October, adding to evidence the automakers are recovering
from the consumer backlash over a territorial dispute, the
association data shows.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , which has the biggest market share in
China among Japanese automakers, reported a 30 percent drop in
November sales to 79,500 units, a narrower decline from October.
 Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s deliveries slumped 29 percent to 41,205
vehicles, while  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  dropped 22 percent to 63,800
vehicles.  Japanese Rebound  “The winter for Japanese brand cars is over,” Dong Yang,
secretary general of the auto association, said at a briefing in
Beijing today.  General Motors Co. (GM) , the biggest foreign automaker in China,
reported a 9.7 percent increase in November sales to 260,018
units, led by its Chevrolet and Buick brands. Ford increased
sales 56 percent to 67,505 vehicles last month.  Among luxury carmakers, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG boosted
sales 62 percent to 31,090 units, while Daimler AG’s Mercedes-
Benz reported a 6.6 percent drop in deliveries to 16,876
vehicles in China, including  Hong Kong .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
