Exxon Mobil Corp. (CVX)  lifted its force
majeure on Qua Iboe crude exports from Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest
oil producer, a company official said.  The force majeure, a legal step that protects a company
from liability when it can’t fulfill a contract for reasons
beyond its control, has been removed, Paul Arinze, general
manager in charge of public and government affairs, said in a
statement released today in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital.  The loading halt had been in place since Nov. 20 after a
Nov. 9 pipeline leak from an Exxon Mobil offshore facility in
the southern Akwa Ibom state spilled crude into the sea. The
facility was shut a day after the incident.  Force majeure on Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s Forcados grade was
lifted on Nov. 29, while a similar halt by Total SA on gas
shipments to  Nigeria  LNG Ltd. was also ended on the same day and
normal production resumed from onshore block OML 58 that pumps
90,000 barrels a day of oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
