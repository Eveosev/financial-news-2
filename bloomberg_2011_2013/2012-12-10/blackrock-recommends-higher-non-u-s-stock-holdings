Russ Koesterich,  BlackRock Inc.’s (BLK) 
chief investment strategist, said investors should consider
putting as much as 40 percent of their portfolios in
international stocks.  “The notion that only 10 percent of your equity allocation
should be outside the United States doesn’t match up with the
economic reality,” Koesterich said today during an interview
with Tom Keene and Michael McKee on Bloomberg Radio’s
“Bloomberg Surveillance.” That’s because the U.S. is
contributing less to the global economy, so investors should
weigh putting from 30 percent to 40 percent in equities outside
of the U.S., depending on their risk tolerance, said Koesterich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
