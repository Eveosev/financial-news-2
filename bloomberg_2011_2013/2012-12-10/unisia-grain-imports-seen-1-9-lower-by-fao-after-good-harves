Tunisia’s grain imports are forecast
to be slip 1.9 percent in the 2012-13 season after an above-
average cereal harvest this year, the  United Nations ’ Food &
Agriculture Organization said.  Imports may drop to 2.61 million metric tons from 2.66
million tons in 2011-12 and 3.33 million tons in 2010-11, the
Rome-based FAO wrote in a  country report  on its website today.  Tunisia is structurally a grain buyer, tapping world
markets even in good harvest years, according to the FAO. The
country’s output varies from year to year depending on rainfall
variations, with winter grains harvested in May and June.  “The new crop year started with above normal rainfall in
September and October,” the UN agency wrote. “Above-average
rainfall contributed to a recovery of water reserves, improved
topsoil moisture and encouraged early winter grain planting.”  The country’s 2012 wheat harvest rose 11 percent to 1.78
million tons, while the barley crop advanced 17 percent to
800,000 tons, the FAO estimates.  Government subsidies on basic food items are keeping
domestic prices in check, with year-on-year inflation of bread
and cereals at 3 percent in November, the FAO wrote. Total food
inflation reached 7.8 percent, driven by a jump of more than 10
percent in meat and vegetable prices, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
