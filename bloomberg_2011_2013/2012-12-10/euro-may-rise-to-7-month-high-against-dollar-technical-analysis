The euro may strengthen to a seven-
month high against the dollar should it stay above a level of
so-called support, ING Groep NV said, citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency is poised to halt recent declines as
long as it remains higher than its 50-day moving average,
currently at $1.2918, and its 200-day average of $1.2785,
according to Roelof-Jan van den Akker, a technical analyst at
ING in Amsterdam. Should it hold above those the euro will rise
toward $1.3172, the high of Sept. 17, he said.  “The market needs to find a bottom, and support comes in
between these two lines,” van den Akker said today in a
telephone interview. “I’m looking for a reversal around that
area, from where the next rally should start.”  The euro appreciated 0.1 percent to $1.2936 at 8:57 a.m. in
 New York  time after falling as low as $1.2881. The high reached
on Sept. 17 was the strongest level since May 4.  Support refers to an area on a price graph where orders to
buy an asset may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
