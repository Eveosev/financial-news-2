Iron ore imports  by  China , the
world’s biggest buyer of the steelmaking raw material, surged to
the second-highest on record in November amid higher alloy
production and expectation some local mines may shut in winter.  Imports reached 65.78 million metric tons last month,
China’s customs bureau said today on its website, the second-
highest level after a record 68.97 million tons in January 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments were 17
percent higher than the 56.43 million tons in October and 2.5
percent more than a year earlier.  China’s  steel production  is set to gain for the 31st
straight year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as the
nation invests in homes, roads and railways. Some domestic  iron
ore  mines may halt in winter, driving up imports, said Xu
Guangjian, an analyst at market researcher Custeel.com.  “The mine-halt expectation may be triggering winter
stockpiling,” Beijing-based Xu said by phone. “Traders are
also buying on expectation prices will rise.”  Steel output may rise 4.7 percent to 715 million tons this
year, according to Custeel.  Iron-ore exports from  Australia , the world’s biggest
shipper of the ingredient, advanced to a record in October.
Exports gained 7.6 percent from September to 44.2 million metric
tons, according to government data compiled by Bloomberg. It
takes about two weeks for Australian vessels to arrive at
Chinese ports.  Iron ore  with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin climbed 2.2 percent to $121 a dry ton on Dec. 7,
the highest since Nov. 19, according to data compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd. Prices gained 14 percent in October after
advancing 17 percent in September.  China’s iron ore imports gained 8.2 percent to 670 million
tons in the first 11 months of this year from a year earlier,
according to customs data on its website.  The country  exported  4.84 million tons of steel products in
November, the customs said. For the first 11 months, shipments
rose 12 percent to 45.78 million tons.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
