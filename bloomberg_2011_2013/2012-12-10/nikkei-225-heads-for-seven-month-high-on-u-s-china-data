Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index halting a two-day gain, after a technical indicator showed
shares may have been overbought on the gauge and revised
estimates confirmed the nation’s economy contracted. Shares rose
earlier after U.S. jobs data topped estimates.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  dropped 5.6 percent after closing at the
highest level since Aug. 30 last week. Hino Motors Ltd. slid 1.3
percent after recalling trucks in the U.S. due to a battery flaw
that could spark fires.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , the world’s biggest
maker of memory-chip testers, rose 3.9 percent after saying it
expects new orders to rise 20 percent this quarter. Sumco Corp.
soared 17 percent after the wafer maker’s price target was
raised at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The Topix fell 0.2 percent to 788.48 at the close in Tokyo
after rising as much as 0.5 percent. Shares also declined after
the yen rose against 14 of its 16 major counterparts. The  Nikkei
225 Stock Average (NKY)  added 0.1 percent to 9,533.75, with trading
volume 9 percent below the 30-day average.  “Low volume and a slowdown in the yen’s decline are
keeping a lid on Japanese equities,” said  Yutaka Miura , a
senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of
 Japan ’s third-biggest lender by market value. “The Nikkei is in
a range around 9,500.”  The Topix advanced 9.2 percent since Nov. 14, when Prime
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  called for elections on Dec. 16, causing
the yen to drop on expectations the opposition  Liberal
Democratic Party  will win and call for more monetary easing.  Relative Value  The Topix  traded  at 0.9 times book value compared with 2.1
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx
600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can be
bought for less than the value of their assets.  The  14-day relative strength index  for the Topix rose to
70.6 on Dec. 7, climbing above the 70 threshold that some
traders say signals a retreat is likely.  Sharp dropped 5.6 percent to 204 yen after its 14-day RSI
gained to 75.8 on Dec. 7.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202)  fell 4.4
percent to 86 yen after its RSI climbed above 70 last week.  Shares also declined after Japan’s gross domestic product
contracted an annualized 3.5 percent in the quarter through
September, the government’s second estimate showed today,
indicating a technical recession.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent today. The gauge
climbed 0.3 percent on Dec. 7, when Labor Department figures
showed employment climbed by 146,000 in November following a
revised 138,000 gain in October. The  unemployment rate  fell to
7.7 percent, the lowest since December 2008, as the size of the
 labor force  shrank.  Chinese Data  Chinese industrial production climbed 10.1 percent in
November from a year earlier and retail sales growth accelerated
to 14.9 percent, topping estimates, while inflation was 2
percent, the statistics bureau said yesterday. Exports rose 2.9
percent from a year earlier and imports were unchanged last
month, the customs administration said today, missing estimates.  “U.S. and Chinese economic data are doing OK, which won’t
put downward pressure on shares,” said Akihiro Tsunoda, a
senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset
Management Co., which manages about 5 trillion yen ($61 billion)
in assets. “Still, investors are inclined to sit on the fence
this week ahead of the Japanese election.”  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  gained 5.6
percent to 17.88, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.1
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Hino Motors dropped 1.3 percent to 700 yen after recalling
certain medium-duty trucks from the ’05-’13 model years because
a circuit from the battery to the starter could short after wear
and may cause a fire, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said.  Advantest Outlook  Advantest advanced 3.9 percent to 1,108 yen after President
Haruo Matsuno said in an interview that orders will increase to
about 30 billion yen this quarter and reach 70.5 billion yen for
the six months ending March 31.  Sumco surged 17 percent to 680 yen. Bank of America analyst
Takashi Enomoto lifted its price target to 930 yen from 820 yen
and maintained a buy rating. Wafer prices are expected to gain
in the first half, and the company’s streamlining has been more
effective than expected, the analyst wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
