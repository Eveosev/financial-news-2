Hungary may extend the application
deadline for foreign-currency mortgage holders to repay their
debt at lower exchange-rates, according to a proposed amendment
by Jozsef Balasz, a member of the ruling Fidesz party.  Households with foreign-currency mortgages may have until
March 29, 2013 to apply at their banks, according to the
amendment posted on parliamentâ€™s  website  today. The current
deadline is Dec. 31.  The government and local banks agreed last year to share
foreign-currency mortgage losses by allowing debtors to repay
their loans at below-market exchange rates for five years. Less
than 21 percent of entitled debtors applied by the end of
October, according to data from financial market regulator
Pszaf. The central bank earlier forecast a participation rate of
around 90 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
