Bank of Montreal , the country’s
fourth-largest bank by assets, said chief economist Sherry Cooper will retire from the bank in January after a 30-year
career.  Cooper, a member of the 12-economist Economic Advisory
Committee of the American Bankers Association, will retire Jan.
30, the Toronto-based bank said today in a statement.  “She brings clarity to the complexity of global economics
and finance -- insights that have been invaluable to BMO and its
clients,”  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  Chief Executive Officer William Downe said in the statement.  Cooper, who has a master’s degree and a doctorate in
economics from the University of Pittsburgh, began her career
with the U.S. Federal Reserve. She moved to  Canada  in 1983 and
become chief economist of Burns Fry, which was later merged into
BMO Capital Markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
