Corn fell to a three-week low in
Chicago as predictions for rains in  Brazil  and drier conditions
in Argentina improved crop prospects for the largest exporters
of the grain after the U.S.  Corn- and soybean-growing areas in southern Brazil were
forecast to get scattered showers and thunderstorms, favoring
developing crops, Telvent DTN Inc. reported Dec. 7. In
Argentina, where rain delayed corn planting, the weather was
expected to become drier, according to the forecaster.  “An improving crop outlook in  South America  will mean
smaller-than-expected export numbers from the U.S.,” Lynette Tan, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, said by phone from
 Singapore  today. “That’s dragging down prices.”  Corn for delivery in March dropped 0.4 percent to $7.34 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:21 p.m. London time.
Prices reached $7.315, the lowest level for the most-active
contract since Nov. 19.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will probably raise its
 estimate  for Brazil’s corn harvest to 70.23 million metric tons
tomorrow from 70 million tons last month, according to the
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Brazil
will be the biggest shipper after the U.S. this marketing year,
according to USDA data.  The crop estimate for  Argentina , the third-ranking
exporter, may be lowered by the USDA to 26 million tons from 28
million tons last month, analysts predicted on average.  Soybeans for delivery in January rose 0.1 percent to
$14.7425 a bushel. Wheat for delivery in March fell 0.3 percent
to $8.5825 a bushel, while milling wheat for the same delivery
month traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris slid 0.3 percent to 267.75
euros ($346.36) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
