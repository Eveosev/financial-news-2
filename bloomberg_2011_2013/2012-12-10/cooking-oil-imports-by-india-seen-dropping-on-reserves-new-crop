Cooking oil imports by  India , the
world’s second-largest user, probably declined for the first
time in four months after record purchases in October boosted
inventories and domestic supplies from the new crop increased.  Purchases fell 9.4 percent to 775,000 metric tons in
November from 855,363 tons a year earlier, according to the
median of estimates from five processors and brokers compiled by
Bloomberg. Imports of crude and refined palm oils fell 8.5
percent to 660,000 tons, the survey showed. The  Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India  will publish data this week.  Reduced imports by India, the world’s biggest palm oil
buyer, may swell inventories in  Malaysia  that are at a record,
and extend a 27 percent slump in prices this year. Stockpiles in
Malaysia jumped to 2.56 million tons last month, the nation’s
 palm oil  board said yesterday. The commodity will probably
tumble into a  bear market  next year as monthly output in
Malaysia and Indonesia surges to records, according to Dorab
Mistry, director at Godrej International Ltd.  “We started this season with high stockpiles as imports in
October were at a record,” Pradip Desai, managing director of
Palmtrade Services Pvt., a Mumbai-based broker, said. “Prices
were also falling, so importers are waiting for them to
stabilize before buying new supplies.”  Palm oil for delivery in February climbed as much as 0.5
percent to 2,324 ringgit ($759) a ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning session little
changed at 2,311 ringgit. Futures lost 5.1 percent last month.  Record Imports  Cooking oil imports surged 17 percent to an all-time high
of 10.2 million tons in the year ended Oct. 31, according to
data from the extractors’ association. Purchases in October were
a record 1.04 million tons, it said.  Inventories, including those at ports and in the pipeline,
were 1.6 million tons as of Nov. 1, near a record 1.7 million
tons in May, data from the association showed. “These
stockpiles are quite high as demand is weak,” Desai said.  Crude  soybean-oil  imports probably jumped to 30,000 tons in
November from 8,000 tons a year earlier, while sunflower-oil
purchases may have declined to 60,000 tons from 78,633 tons, the
survey showed.  “A good soybean crop and better domestic availability of
oils aided the decline in imports,”  Atul Chaturvedi , chief
executive officer of Adani Wilmar Ltd., said. Harvesting of the
new soybean crop is under way, boosting supplies.  Soybean crop is estimated at a record 11.5 million tons
this year, Rajesh Agrawal, spokesman for the Soybean Processors’
Association, said on Oct. 23. India buys palm oil from Indonesia
and Malaysia, and  soybean oil  from Brazil and  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
