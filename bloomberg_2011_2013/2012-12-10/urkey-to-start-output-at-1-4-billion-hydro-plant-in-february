Turkey will start the $1.4 billion
Deriner hydropower plant in February after test runs are done.  The plant, one of  10  on the Coruh River, will produce 2.12
billion kilowatt-hours a year, almost 1 percent of the countryâ€™s
generation, Ankara-based State Hydraulics Works, known as DSI,
said today in a statement. Construction began in 1997.  The 670-megawatt arch-dam project, built by a group made up
of  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) ,  Sulzer AG (SUN) , Stucky SA, Technostroyexport of Russia
and Erg Insaat of Turkey, will be inaugurated by Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan  on Dec. 12, according to the statement.  Turkey had hydropower capacity of 19,500 megawatts at the
end of November, about a third of its total generation of 56,760
megawatts, according to the  website  of Turkiye Elektrik Iletim
AS, the state transmission utility. DSI, which manages river-
projects for the nation, will transfer the operation of the
plant to government-run producer Elektrik Uretim AS, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
