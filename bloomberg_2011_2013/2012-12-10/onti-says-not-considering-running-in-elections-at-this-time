Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said he won’t consider running in elections that may be held in
Italy as soon as February.  “I am not considering this particular issue at this
stage,” Monti said at a press conference in Oslo. “All my
efforts are being devoted to the completion of the remaining
time of the current government, which appears to be rather short
but still requires intensive application of mind and energy on
my part as well as my council of ministers”.  Monti said Dec. 8 he’ll step down as prime minister once
the budget is passed. The announcement, made after former
premier  Silvio Berlusconi ’s party withdrew support for his
government, sparked selling of Italian stocks and bonds today,
dragging European markets lower. Monti, a former European
commissioner, said today that the market reaction was normal and
investors shouldn’t fear a political vacuum in  Italy .  “I understand market reaction, they need not to be
dramatized,” Monti said, adding that he expected the next
government to be a “a highly responsible EU oriented
government, which will be in line with the huge efforts already
pursued by Italy recently in terms of budge discipline and
structural reforms.”  Elections will be held 45 to 70 days after President
Giorgio Napolitano dissolves parliament, which could happen as
soon as this month. In that interim period, Monti may remain
premier, or Napolitano may appoint a caretaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
