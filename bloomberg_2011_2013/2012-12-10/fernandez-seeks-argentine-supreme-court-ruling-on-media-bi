Argentina’s President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  asked the Supreme Court to be independent
when ruling on media legislation as  Grupo Clarin SA, (GCLA)  the
country’s biggest media company, questions its
constitutionality.  The government on Dec. 7 asked the court to revoke a
suspension on the 2009 antitrust law that would’ve broken up
Clarin’s media group.  “It’s a necessary that courts are independent not just of
the political power but also of the economic powers,” Fernandez
said yesterday at a celebration of Human Rights Day at the Plaza
de Mayo square in Buenos Aires. “If laws approved by Congress
are not respected, what kind of democracy do we have?”  Clarin won on Dec. 6 a last minute ruling that extended a
suspension on part of the media bill that was scheduled to end
on Dec. 7 and that forced Clarin to sell assets that exceed the
legal ownerships limits. The decision was a reversal for
Fernandez’s government, which orchestrated a media campaign and
public rally to celebrate the deadline set by the  Supreme Court 
back in May.  The company’s shares on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange
rose 18.7 percent last week to close at 8.31 pesos on Dec. 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
