Russian stocks traded in New York
gained on prospects Bank Rossii will move to cut  interest rates 
after reducing the cost to swap foreign currency.  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY) 
rallied after approving the sale of a stake at a premium.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. posted the longest stretch of
increases in two weeks as RTS stock-index  futures  expiring on
Dec. 17 were little changed. American depositary receipts of
 RusHydro (HYDR) ,  Russia ’s biggest renewable energy producer, jumped the
most since May 21 after it approved the issuance of 110 billion
ordinary shares to the government at a 36 percent premium to its
Dec. 7 Moscow closing price.  The central bank took a step toward the first round of
monetary easing in a year after cutting yesterday the cost to
swap foreign currency into rubles by a quarter point to 6.5
percent to help shore up the economy. Deputy Economy Minister
 Andrei Klepach  said yesterday the government lowered its growth
forecast for this year to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent, citing a
deceleration in  consumer lending  and real wage increases.  “The central bank’s decision today is a positive factor
for those who borrow money to buy shares,”  Alexander Morozov ,
the chief economist for Russia at HSBC Holdings Plc, said by
phone yesterday from Moscow. “It creates more predictability
for such investors, gives them more confidence.”  RusHydro surged 6.7 percent to $2.38 in New York yesterday.
The  stock  gained 3.4 percent to 76.01 kopecks, or 2.47 U.S.
cents, in Moscow yesterday. The company’s  global depositary
receipts  rose 4.7 percent to $2.41 in  London  yesterday, the
highest level since Nov. 23.  ‘Best-Case Scenario’  RusHydro’s board approved the additional share issue and
said the company will transfer them to the government, according
to a Dec. 10 regulatory filing. The government owned 60.5
percent of RusHydro as of June 30 according to its website. It
has injected 50.2 billion rubles into the company last week, in
exchange for the new shares.  Russian President  Vladimir Putin  delayed electricity tariff
increases before the presidential vote on March 4, hampering
Rushydro’s efforts to fund a four-year, $12.3 billion investment
plan. Putin last month signed a decree approving a government
proposal to provide RusHydro with as much as 50 billion rubles
($1.6 billion) from the budget this year and allowing the
company to issue additional shares to increase its capital,
according to an e-mailed copy of the document.  “It’s the best-case scenario for RusHydro so far,” Sergey Beiden, an analyst at Otkritie Financial Corp. who has a hold
rating on RusHydro, said by phone from Moscow yesterday. “It
excludes, at least for now, market-unfriendly approaches toward
the reform of the company.”  Oil Drops  The Bloomberg Russia-US Index climbed 1.1 percent to 96.44
yesterday, the highest level since Oct. 23. The  Market Vectors
Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund,
added 0.7 percent to $28.84, the highest close since Oct. 22.
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
futures, fell 4.1 percent to 23.54.  Futures expiring in December on the ruble showed the
currency weakening 0.1 percent to 30.806 per dollar after the
ruble gained 0.6 percent to 30.72 against the dollar yesterday.  Oil, which together with natural gas accounted for half of
Russia’s  federal budget  revenue last year, declined for a fifth
day in New York yesterday, losing 0.4 percent to $85.56 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the lowest
settlement since Nov. 15. Prices are down 13 percent this year.  Brent for January settlement added 0.3 percent to $107.33 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Urals
crude, the country’s main export blend, fell 0.1 percent to
$105.48 a barrel yesterday.  Mechel, Norilsk  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest producer of steelmaking coal,
advanced 2.9 percent to $6.43 in New York yesterday, the highest
level since Nov. 6. The ADRs settled at a 2.8 percent premium to
the company’s Moscow-listed stock, the highest since Oct. 17.
The  stock  slipped 0.4 percent to 192.1 rubles, or $6.25.  Aton Capital cut its recommendation on Mechel to sell from
hold, reducing the target price to $5 per ADR from $6.5.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) , the world’s largest producer of the
