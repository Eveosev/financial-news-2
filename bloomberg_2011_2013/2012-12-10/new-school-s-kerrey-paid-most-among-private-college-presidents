Thirty-six presidents of private,
nonprofit U.S. universities were paid more than $1 million in
2010, led by  Bob Kerrey , the former Nebraska senator and
president of the New School in New York, a study showed.  Lee Bollinger , president of  Columbia University  in New
York, with $1.93 million in total compensation, was the highest-
paid president in the Ivy League and seventh-highest overall in
2010, according to the  Chronicle of Higher Education , which
published a study of the pay of 493 private school presidents
yesterday. The average presidential compensation was $396,649 a
year, up 2.8 percent from 2009.  Kerrey, who ran the New School for a decade before
resigning in December 2010 in an unsuccessful bid to be re-
elected to the U.S. Senate, made $3.05 million. Presidents’
compensation may include bonuses, deferred pay and benefits such
as housing and cars, according to tax data. Following Kerrey on
the list is Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, New York, who was paid $2.34
million, and G. David Pollick, former president of Birmingham-
Southern College in Alabama, at $2.31 million.  Richard Levin , the president of  Yale University  in New
Haven, Connecticut, was the second-highest paid Ivy League
leader and eighth overall, making $1.62 million. Levin is
retiring in June 2013.  Drew Gilpin Faust, president of  Harvard University , in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, was paid $875,331, 47th on the
Chronicle’s list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
