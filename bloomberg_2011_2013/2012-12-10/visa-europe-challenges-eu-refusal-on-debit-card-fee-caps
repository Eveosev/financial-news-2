Visa  Europe  Ltd. challenged the
European Union’s refusal to allow it to change a 2010 cap on
debit-card transaction fees paid by retailers.  The European Commission’s July 31 decision to reject Visa
Europe’s request should be overturned, the operator of Europe’s
largest payment-card network said in an  appeal  to the bloc’s
second-highest court. The commission violated the EU’s  Charter
of Fundamental Rights  by refusing Visa Europe “the opportunity
to effectively make known its views on the relevant facts.”  The commission also “committed a manifest error of
assessment” by rejecting evidence by Visa Europe “on the basis
of flawed considerations,” the London-based company said in its
appeal, details of which were published today.  Visa Europe reduced debit-card transaction fees in 2010 as
part of a settlement of a 2009 statement of objections by the EU
antitrust regulator. In July, Visa Europe was sent another EU
 statement of objections  for “possible violations of EU
antitrust rules concerning multilateral interchange fees” for
transactions with consumer credit cards set by the company. Visa
Europe split from  Visa Inc. (V)  before the U.S. card company’s
initial public offering in early 2008.  Visa Europe declined to comment beyond confirming it had
filed the appeal.  The case is: T-447/12, Visa Europe v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
