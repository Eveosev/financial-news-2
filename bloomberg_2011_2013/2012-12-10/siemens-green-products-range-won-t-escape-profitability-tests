Siemens AG (SIE)  will subject its range of
so-called green products that are central to its growth to the
same profitability tests as older businesses as it looks to
improve returns, the manager leading the cost cuts said.  Siemens is reviewing units to identify any that lag
profitability or prospects, and its operations contributing to
the 33 billion euros ($43 billion) in environmentally friendly
products are part of the same process, Barbara Kux, board member
responsible for procurement and sustainability, said in an
interview.  “There is an end to romance when it comes to
profitability,´´ said Kux, who is scheduled to leave the Munich-
based company in November. ‘‘We apply the same criteria for
profitability and returns to our green products as we do to all
others.´´  Siemens is in the midst of its largest cost-cutting program
ever, aiming to reduce expenses by 6 billion euros by 2014.
While several of the company’s products, such as high-speed
trains or energy-saving technology for office buildings, help
customers save energy, their returns have prompted investors’
demands for Siemens to consider exiting them.  Siemens is now implementing proposals put forward by
managers to raise efficiency, including plans by infrastructure
division head Roland Busch. The company’s wind business is
aiming to return to a typical level for Siemens.  Green Goals Intact  There is no bonus just because a business is green, Kux
said.  Investors got a taste for the company’s renewed focus in
October when Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher  said he
would sell the company’s solar power operations, just three
years after creating the business.  On Nov. 8, Siemens said it will dispose of parts of its
water business, another unit contributing to the company’s green
portfolio.  While the announced disposals reduce the amount of sales
with environmentally friendly products, Kux said Siemens is
still well-positioned to reach a goal for generating 40 billion
euros in revenue with such solutions by 2014. Reaching its goal
will be a challenge, the company has said.  ‘‘The goal seems ambitious,´´ said Christoph Niesel, a fund
manager at Union Investment in Frankfurt. ‘‘Aiming for size
should not be the sole stipulation; returns must be kept in
sight.´´  Siemens has an auditor performing annual checks to ensure
the green label is more than marketing. The majority of green
products the company sells is related to energy efficiency,
where criteria demand an improvement of at least 20 percent over
rival technology to qualify.  Kux say the size and growth of the market means Siemens
will succeed.  ‘‘The market for green technologies worldwide is 2 trillion
euros today, and set to grow above 4 trillion by 2025,´´ she
said. ‘‘It’s a gigantic business with lots of potential.´  To contact the reporter on this story:
