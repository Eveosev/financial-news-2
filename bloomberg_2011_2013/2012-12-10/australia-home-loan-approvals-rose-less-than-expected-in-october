Australian home-loan approvals rose
less than economists forecast in October even after central bank
interest-rate reductions aimed at stimulating the economy and
boosting the housing market.  The number of loans granted to build or buy houses and
apartments advanced 0.1 percent from September, when they rose a
revised 1.1 percent, the statistics bureau said in Sydney today.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 18 economists
was for approvals to increase 3 percent.  Today’s data follow government reports in the past two
weeks showing economic growth slowed last quarter and mining
companies lowered forecast investment for this fiscal year. The
 Reserve Bank  of  Australia  has reduced the overnight cash rate
target six times since Nov. 1, 2011, to try to revive the
housing market to help extend a 21-year run without a recession.  “The result is a continuation of the cautiousness in the
household sector as consumers pay down debt, preventing a strong
rebound in housing finance,” Matthew Circosta, an economist at
Moody’s Analytics in Sydney, said before the release.  The Australian dollar was little changed at $1.0484 at
11:36 a.m. in Sydney after the report.  The total value of loans rose 1.8 percent to A$21.6 billion
($22.6 billion) in October.  The value of lending to owner-occupiers declined 0.2
percent, the report showed. The value of loans to investors who
plan to rent or resell homes advanced 5.5 percent.  First-home buyers accounted for 18.7 percent of dwellings
that were financed in October, down from 19.4 percent in
September and lower than 19.3 percent a year earlier, the report
showed today.  Rate Cuts  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board last week cut the
benchmark rate to 3 percent, matching the half-century low set
during the 2009 global recession. Policy makers are aiming to
rebalance the two-speed economy, where mining regions in the
north and west thrive and manufacturers, builders and retailers
in the south and east struggle.  “Recent data confirm that the peak in resource investment
is approaching,” Stevens said in a Dec. 4 statement announcing
the rate decision. “As it does, there will be more scope for
some other areas of demand to strengthen.”  The RBA has lowered borrowing costs in six moves: 25 basis
points apiece in November and December 2011, then 50 basis
points in May, 25 in June, 25 in October and 25 this month.
Still, the number of Australian construction jobs fell by 70,200
to 978,000 in the 12 months through August. Mining employment
gained by 44,600 over the same period to 271,000, government
figures show.  A Dec. 5 government report showed Australia’s economy
slowed last quarter on the weakest consumer demand in 2 1/2
years and tighter  government spending . A day earlier, data
showed home-building approvals declined more than economists
forecast in October, led by a slump in apartment projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
