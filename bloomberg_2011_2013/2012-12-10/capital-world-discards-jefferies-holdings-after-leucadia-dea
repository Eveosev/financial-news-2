Capital World Investors, the third-
largest shareholder in  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , sold its
4.9 percent stake after the New York-based investment bank
agreed to be bought by Leucadia National Corp.  Capital World said it owned no shares in Jefferies as of
Nov. 30, according to a regulatory filing today. The Los
Angeles-based investment manager  held  9.89 million shares as of
Sept. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jefferies, run by Chief Executive Officer  Richard Handler ,
agreed last month to be acquired in a stock swap with Leucadia,
its biggest holder. Ken Masson, a spokesman for Capital World in
New York, and Richard Khaleel at Jefferies declined to comment.  Capital World almost doubled its stake last year after
Jefferies fell 48 percent in 2011. The stock dropped as Wall
Street banks struggled to maintain trading revenue and as  MF
Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) ’s bankruptcy fueled speculation that
Jefferies might also be toppled by Europe’s debt crisis.  Jefferies fell 0.3 percent to $17.85 at 11:49 a.m. in New
York. The shares have gained 30 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
