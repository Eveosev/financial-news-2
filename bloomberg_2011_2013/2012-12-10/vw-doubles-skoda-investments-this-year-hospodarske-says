Skoda Auto AS, the Czech unit of
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , doubled its investments in production this year,
 Mlada Fronta Dnes  reported, citing Skoda Chief Executive Officer
Winfried Vahland.  The company invested 525 million euros ($678 million) in
the first nine months of the year to expand and modernize
Skoda’s three production plants in the  Czech Republic , the
newspaper said, citing Vahland.  Skoda is planning to unveil the new version of its Octavia,
Superb and Yeti models as well as a sports model with a working
name Spaceback, the newspaper said, citing the executive.  Vahland doesn’t expect to see some major improvement on the
European car market next year, even though the fact that
 Germany , one of Skoda’s main markets, remains stable is
positive, the newspaper cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
