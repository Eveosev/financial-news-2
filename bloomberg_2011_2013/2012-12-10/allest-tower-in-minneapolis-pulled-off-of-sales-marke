Inland American Real Estate Trust
Inc. ended its effort to sell the 57-story IDS Center, the
tallest building in  Minneapolis , about five months after putting
the property on the market.  “We have decided to hold on to this iconic asset,” Jeff
Manno, Inland’s vice president of transactions, said in an e-
mailed statement. “There isn’t and never was an urgency to sell
this property and we continue to believe in its strength in the
Minneapolis marketplace.”  Inland, based in Oak Brook,  Illinois , had been seeking a
sale of the office tower as it shifts its focus to retail,
lodging and student-housing holdings. While the company is
continuing to pursue that strategy, the IDS Center “has served
us well the last six years and we believe it will continue to do
so,” Manno said.  Demand is rising for office space in Minneapolis. The
 vacancy rate  fell to 18.2 percent in the third quarter from 19.2
percent a year earlier, according to data from  Reis Inc. (REIS) , a New
York-based research firm. Rents rose to $16.86 a square foot
from $16.55 a year earlier.  Inland bought the IDS Center in 2006 for about $277
million, the company said at the time. It hired  HFF Inc. (HF)  to
market the building in July, according to a statement from the
broker.  The skyscraper opened in 1972 and includes a retail center,
Crystal Court. It was designed by the American architect Philip
Johnson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
