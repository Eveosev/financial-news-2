A referendum on the exploration of
shale-gas in several Romanian towns and villages near the  Black
Sea  was invalidated because of a lower-than-required turnout,
 Agerpres  reported, citing local authority officials.  A minimum turnout of half of the electorate, needed to
validate the vote, wasnâ€™t met in the city of Mangalia, Mayor
Cristian Radu said, according to the Bucharest-based news
service. The turnout in Costinesti and Limanu villages reached
49.7 percent and 39.2 percent respectively, Agerpres said.  The citizens were called to vote on whether they agree or
not with shale-gas exploration through hydraulic fracturing,
after  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  announced plans to explore the area for the
resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
