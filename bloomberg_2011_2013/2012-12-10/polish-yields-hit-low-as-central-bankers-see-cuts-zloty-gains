Polish 10-year bond yields dropped
for a fourth day to a record low after two policy makers
signaled the central bank will cut rates next month and before a
report expected to show inflation is slowing.  The yield on notes due on October 2023 fell eight basis
points to 3.87 percent as of 5:19 p.m. in Warsaw, having
declined eight basis points last week. The zloty advanced 0.3
percent to 4.1082 against the euro.  The central bank cut borrowing costs for a second time in
as many months last week, reducing the main  interest rates  by a
total of 50 basis points to 4.25 percent. Poland remains in
monetary easing mode, policy maker Elzbieta Chojna-Duch said on
TVN CNBC today. A rate cut in January is almost certain, fellow
central banker  Adam Glapinski  told PAP newswire today. A report
due on Dec. 13 will show the inflation rate dropped to 2.9
percent in November, a two-month low, according to a median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 31 economists.  “Morning comments from Chojna-Duch and Glapinski confirm
prospects for an interest-rate cut in January,” Aleksandra Bluj, a fixed-income analyst at  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  in Warsaw, said in
an e-mailed report. “While the expectations are strong, the
yields may decline further.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
