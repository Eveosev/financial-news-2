Lithuanian  inflation  unexpectedly
slowed in November as the cost of transport and energy fell.  The inflation rate dropped to 2.8 percent, the lowest in
four months, from 3.1 percent in October, the  statistics office 
in the capital, Vilnius, said in an e-mailed statement today. A
Bloomberg survey of three economists had forecast an increase of
3.1 percent. Prices decreased 0.2 percent on the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
