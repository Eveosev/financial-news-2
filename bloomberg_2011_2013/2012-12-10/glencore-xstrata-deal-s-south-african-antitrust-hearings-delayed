Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , the
commodities trader that’s agreed to buy  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , extended
the deadline to complete the $33 billion deal by a month
following delays in getting regulator approval in  South Africa .  South Africa’s Competition Tribunal earlier postponed
hearings on the transaction that were due to start yesterday.
They will now take place on Jan. 18, Jan. 21-23 and Jan. 28, the
Pretoria-based antitrust body said in an e-mailed statement. The
deadline to complete the deal will be extended to Jan. 31, Baar,
Switzerland-based Glencore and Xstrata said in statements.  South Africa’s power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. has
concerns over its ability to secure timely and competitively-
priced coal after the takeover. The combined entity would
account for about 15 percent of Eskom’s coal supplies, the
utility that supplies about 95 percent of the country’s
electricity. said Dec. 7.  The postponement to the hearings was requested by Glencore
and Xstrata and relates to the scope of Eskom’s intervention in
the review, Nandi Mokoena, a spokeswoman for the tribunal, said
by phone.  Glencore on Nov. 22 won European Union approval for its
takeover of Zug, Switzerland-based Xstrata after offering to end
a zinc-purchase agreement with  Nyrstar (NYR)  NV and to sell its stake
in the company. Chinese commerce ministry approval is also
outstanding for the deal, which creates the world’s fourth-
biggest mining company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
