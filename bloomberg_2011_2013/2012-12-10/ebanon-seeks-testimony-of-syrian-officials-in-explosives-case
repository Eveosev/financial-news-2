Lebanon’s military prosecutor has
asked an investigative judge presiding over the case of former
Lebanese Information Minister Michel Samaha, who’s accused of
possession of explosives, to question two Syrian officers
allegedly involved in supplying him.  Prosecutor Saqr Saqr has asked the judge to question the
chief of  Syria ’s National Security Agency, Ali Mamlouk, and Col.
Adnan, whose last name is not known, the official Lebanese
National News Agency said today. Saqr has also instructed the
judge to consider the testimony of Syrian President Bashar al- Assad’s adviser Bouthaina Shaaban, NNA said.  The agency reported in August that bombs were found in
Samaha’s car and that they had been prepared by the two Syrians.
Judge Sami Sader, the government’s deputy commissioner at the
Military Tribunal in  Beirut , charged Samaha and the two officers
with plotting to assassinate religious and political figures,
NNA reported then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
