The lira weakened for a fourth day
as  Turkey ’s economic growth fell to the lowest in three years
and industrial production shrank more than expected, fueling
bets for an interest-rate cut this month.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent against the dollar to
1.79 by 5:40 p.m. in Istanbul, the lowest since Nov. 28, in the
longest losing streak since Aug. 30. Yields on two-year
benchmark debt fell 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
5.75 percent, trading two basis points above their record low.  Gross domestic product , the value of all goods and services
produced, advanced 1.6 percent on an annual basis in the third
quarter, the state statistics office in Ankara said on its
 website  today. That’s the slowest since a drop of 2.8 percent in
the third quarter of 2009.  Industrial production  contracted 5.7
percent, after expanding 6.2 percent in September. Output was
expected to decline 2.5 percent, according to the median
forecast of 10 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Today’s data “will support even more a relaxation of the
repo rate and the borrowing rate,” Cristian Maggio, an
emerging-market strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  in  London ,
said in an e-mail today.  A rate cut will weaken the lira to 1.80 and beyond against
the dollar, Maggio said.  The bank lowered the top-end of its so-called interest-rate
corridor by 50 basis points to 9 percent on Nov. 20, while
keeping the overnight borrowing rate steady at 5 percent and the
benchmark  interest rates  unchanged at 5.75 percent. Turkey’s
rate-setting meeting will be held on Dec. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
