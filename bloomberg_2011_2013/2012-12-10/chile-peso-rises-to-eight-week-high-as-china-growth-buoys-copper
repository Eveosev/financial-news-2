Chile ’s peso rose to an eight-week
high as the price of copper, the country’s main export, rallied
on expanding industrial output in  China .  The currency gained 0.3 percent to 475.6 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close of trading in Santiago, the strongest level since Oct.
19. Copper for March delivery rose as much as 1.5 percent to
$3.719 a pound.  Chinese  industrial production  expanded 10.1 percent last
month, topping the 9.8 percent median forecast of economists in
a Bloomberg survey. China is Chile’s biggest trade partner and
the main market for its copper, which makes up more than half
the Andean country’s exports.  “We’re breaking through a support level,” said Cristian
Donoso, a currency trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago. “Today’s a good day for commodities. Copper at $3.7
is great.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
