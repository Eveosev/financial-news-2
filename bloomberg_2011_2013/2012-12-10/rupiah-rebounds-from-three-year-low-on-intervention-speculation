Indonesia ’s rupiah gained the most
in two weeks, rebounding from a three-year low, on speculation
the central bank intervened in the market to stabilize the
currency.  Bank Indonesia  will hold its benchmark  rate  at a record-low
5.75 percent for a 10th month tomorrow, according to all 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The monetary authority
continues to reduce the local currency’s volatility in line with
its fundamentals, it said in a Nov. 8 statement on its website.
Indonesia’s  trade balance  swung to a shortfall of $1.5 billion
in October, indicating the current account will probably remain
in deficit for a fifth straight quarter.  “The rupiah tends to approach new lows, but the central
bank seeks to stabilize the exchange rate,” said Taufan Tito, a
Jakarta-based foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Rakyat
Indonesia. “Investors want the  reference rate  raised
considering the current-account deficit but it will probably be
steady this year.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.2 percent to 9,635 per dollar as
of 3:28 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest gain since Nov. 26, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It reached 9,733
earlier, the weakest level since September 2009. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, rose 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 5.5 percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due in May
2022 climbed one basis point to 5.38 percent, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
