Gasoline at U.S. service stations
dropped to the lowest level in 11 months in the past three weeks
as crude prices retreated and  refineries  came back on line after
stoppages, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The average price for regular gasoline at U.S. pumps fell
9.62 cents in the three weeks ended Dec. 7 to $3.3766 a gallon,
the survey of about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo, California-
based survey company showed. The average, now the lowest since
Jan. 6, has declined 46.09 cents a gallon over the past nine
weeks and is 59.1 cents below the year-to-date high of $3.9671
on April 6.  “Somewhat lower crude oil prices, refinery problems being
reduced and resolved one after the other and demand coming down
as it always does in the winter combined to create this drop,”
Trilby Lundberg, president of Lundberg Survey, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. “I’m expecting further drops at
the pump, maybe as much as another dime,” barring a change in
oil prices, she said.  The drop underscores how rising domestic crude production
is eroding fuel costs in the world’s biggest oil consumer seven
months after prices were headed back to $4 a gallon in the run-
up to the presidential election.  Gasoline stockpiles  rose 7.86
million barrels in the week ended Nov. 30, the most since Sept.
21, 2001, the Energy Department reported.  Futures Market  West Texas Intermediate has dropped 21 percent since
reaching a year-to-date closing high of $109.77 on Feb. 24.
Futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange fell 74 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $85.93 a barrel in the three weeks to Dec. 7.  Inventories declined 2.36 million barrels in the week ended
Nov. 30 to 371.8 million, according to Energy Department data.
Refineries ran at 90.6 percent of capacity, the highest level
since Aug. 24.  Gasoline production  jumped 5.4 percent.  Gasoline futures on the Nymex slid 11.27 cents, or 4.2
percent, to $2.5974 a gallon in the past three weeks. Futures
have dropped 24 percent since reaching a year-to-date high of
$3.4166 on March 26. They traded at $2.6274 at noon London time
today.  Oil may retreat this week on weak economic growth in  Europe 
and a stalemate in budget negotiations in the U.S. on how to
avert more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts
set for January, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Thirteen of 29 analysts, or 45 percent, forecast crude will
decrease through Dec. 14. Nine respondents, or 31 percent,
predicted a gain. Seven forecast little change. Last week, 33
percent of analysts projected an increase.  The European Central Bank this month cut its 2013 euro-area
economic forecast to a contraction of 0.3 percent from 0.5
percent growth.  L.A., New York  U.S. House Speaker John Boehner said Dec. 7 that there was
no progress in budget talks with the White House to avoid the
so-called fiscal cliff. Obama, a Democrat, has said there won’t
be a deal without an increase in taxes on upper-income
taxpayers. Republicans want to cut spending on entitlements and
other programs while keeping current tax rates in place.  Regular gasoline on Long Island, the highest price in the
lower 48 U.S. states among the markets surveyed, was about $3.85
a gallon, down 32.32 cents since Nov. 18, Lundberg said. Los
Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.68, down 12.78 cents.  The lowest price was in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , where customers
paid an average of $3.04 a gallon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
