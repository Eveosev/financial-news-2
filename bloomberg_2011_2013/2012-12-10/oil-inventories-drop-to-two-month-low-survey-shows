U.S. oil  stockpiles  probably dropped
last week to the lowest level in almost two months as refineries
ramped up fuel production, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Crude supplies declined 2.5 million barrels, or 0.7
percent, in the week ended Dec. 7 to 369.3 million, the least
since Oct. 12, according to the median of seven analyst
estimates surveyed before an Energy Department report on Dec.
12. Six of the respondents forecast a decrease and one projected
a gain.  Refinery operation rates stayed at 90.6 percent, the
highest since Aug. 24, the survey showed. Oil stockpiles fell
2.36 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 30, down for a third
week, the Energy Department reported last week.  “The overall volume of refinery crude runs is likely to
have gone up, and that’s going to help convert more crude oil
barrels into products,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at
Citi Futures Perspective in New York.  Crude oil for January delivery slid 37 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $85.56 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures are down 13 percent this year.  The Bloomberg survey also showed gasoline  stockpiles 
probably gained 2 million barrels, or 0.9 percent, to 214.1
million. All seven respondents projected an increase.
Inventories jumped 7.86 million the previous week to 212.1
million.  Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, probably rose 1.5 million barrels to
116.6 million, according to the median of responses. All seven
respondents forecast an advance. Supplies increased 3.03 million
the previous week to 115.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
