U.S. lawmakers and lobbyists who
once backed repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act are now pushing
for technical fixes to the law, and they’re getting a skeptical
reception from the measure’s advocates.  While some alterations to the act have bipartisan support
in Congress, many Democrats say they remain wary of measures
that might undermine the law that created the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and mandated regulations to curb risky
behavior by financial institutions deemed too big to fail.  “There is general agreement that technical corrections on
an 800-page bill would be appropriate,” said Lauren Kulik, a
spokeswoman for Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from  Ohio  and
a member of the Senate Banking Committee. At the same time, she
said, Dodd-Frank supporters worry that a technical change could
“morph into a substantive change.”  “Technical corrections are in the eye of the beholder,”
said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who also sits on
the committee.  Lawmakers and industry advocates are working on
categorizing which of the many proposals for Dodd-Frank changes
should be defined as technical, said James Ballentine,
executive vice president of congressional relations and
political affairs at the American Bankers Association.  “Easy and technical are not two words that go together in
this environment,” Ballentine said. “A technical fix for some
is a major issue for others and that’s what requires
discussion.”  As that discussion evolves, proponents of change to Dodd-
Frank say they see support growing in both parties.  ‘Punishing’ Banks  “The biggest difference between today and two years ago is
that lawmakers seem to be focused less on punishing the banks
and more on how to get credit flowing again,” said Jaret Seiberg, senior policy analyst at Washington Research Group, a
unit of Guggenheim Securities. “And that’s a bipartisan
perspective that could open the door to Dodd-Frank reform.”  Lisa Donner, executive director of  Americans for Financial
Reform , which advocates tighter banking regulation, said the
industry has disguised broad changes to Dodd-Frank as minor
tweaks to gain support. She said no consensus exists for
technical changes.  “People telling the story about how there’s a bipartisan
consensus are actually campaigning for significant rollbacks of
the law,” she said.  Among proposals with bipartisan support are alterations to
to the law’s derivatives provisions and a bill intended to limit
distribution of confidential bank data obtained by the consumer
bureau. Other changes, including a Republican proposal to
replace the director of that bureau with a five-member
commission, have lawmakers split along party lines.  Measures Advanced  The Republican-controlled House has already acted on some
Dodd-Frank changes proposed by financial firms. The chamber
approved a bill in March to exempt manufacturers and commercial
swap-users from collateral requirements and ease regulations on
inter-company trades. Other measures have won committee approval
and are awaiting floor votes.  The Senate, controlled by Democrats, hasn’t approved any of
those Dodd-Frank changes.  “Leadership in the House should be able to pass a ham
sandwich if they want,” Seiberg said. “It’s the Senate where
the minority party and majority party have to work together if
you want to get something passed.”  Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a South
Dakota Democrat, has asked the banking industry to define the
“technical changes” it would like to see, according to two
people involved in the discussions.  ‘Unintended Consequences’  “I am open to the idea of improving Wall Street reform by
making technical corrections and fixing unintended consequences,
but in today’s political environment there will need to be broad
bipartisan support to get anything approved,” Johnson said
during a hearing in March.  “There are some reports from the Senate that they are
willing to take a look at some of the reforms,” said
Representative Scott Garrett, a Republican from New Jersey who
sits on the Financial Services Committee. “I welcome them to
the table. They took the view for the last two years that
nothing at all needed to be changed in Dodd-Frank despite the
fact that members of their own party in the House voted on bills
out of committee and onto the floor.”  Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from  Virginia  and Dodd-
Frank supporter, said he would like to see several alterations
to the law, including an independent leader to replace the
Treasury secretary as head of the Financial Stability Oversight
Council, a panel created to spot systemic risk, as well changes
to derivatives rules.  ‘Repeal or Nothing’  “The political context is such that it is either repeal or
nothing, which is an absurd way to approach any major
legislative activity,” he said of Dodd-Frank during a speech
before the Bipartisan Policy Center on Oct. 18.  The focus on technical changes reflects a growing sense
among Dodd-Frank opponents that the measure’s repeal is all but
dead.  “The election result means the idea of repealing Dodd-
Frank is not going to happen,” said Phillip Swagel, a former
Treasury assistant secretary in the administration of President
George W. Bush and now an economics professor at the University
of Maryland’s School of Public Policy. “With that discussion
over, it should be more possible to make smaller changes.”  Mark Calabria, a former top Republican aide for the Senate
Banking Committee who now directs financial regulation studies
at the Cato Institute, said with Democrats’ gains in the
election Republicans must “begrudgingly accept” Dodd-Frank and
focus more on technical changes.  ‘Gray Area’  “There’s certainly a gray area of what’s technical and
what’s not and people will play that to their advantage,”
Calabria said.  Dodd-Frank critics had hopes for a technical corrections
bill even before law was signed by President  Barack Obama . As
the act was moving toward passage its Democratic authors,
Senator Chris Dodd of  Connecticut  and Representative Barney Frank of  Massachusetts , said there would be a future bill to
make corrections. Dodd said any 2,000-page bill is bound to be
followed by “a corrections bill that comes at some point,” and
Frank said the next bill may go beyond “technical” fixes.  After the financial-overhaul law was enacted, Democrats and
the administration attacked any effort amend the law. In May
2011, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said “dark
forces” are waging a “war of attrition” against Dodd-Frank.  Never Easy  The measure to limit how the consumer bureau shares
confidential information it collects from banks is an example of
the complications that await even bipartisan changes to Dodd-
Frank.  Republican Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina placed a
“hold” or procedural block on the bill, which was endorsed by
the consumer bureau, saying in July he would lift the obstacle
in return for a vote to repeal all of Dodd-Frank.  DeMint, who is leaving the Senate at the end of the year to
become president of the Heritage Foundation, told Politico last
week that he would remove his “hold” without the repeal vote
in light of the election results. Now, with DeMint leaving the
Senate, it is unclear whether he will stop blocking the bill,
clearing it for a quick vote. Wesley Denton, a spokesman for
DeMint, has not returned repeated calls and e-mails for comment
on the hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
