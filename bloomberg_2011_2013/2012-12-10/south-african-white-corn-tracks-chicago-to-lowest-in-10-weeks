South African white-corn futures
fell to the lowest in 10 weeks, tracking a drop in the price of
the grain in the U.S., the biggest producer. The yellow variety
also fell.  White corn for March delivery, the most-active contract,
closed 0.8 percent lower at 2,436 rand ($280) a metric ton, the
lowest since Oct. 1, on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in July, declined
2.1 percent to 2,250 rand a ton, the lowest since Nov. 13.  Corn on the Chicago Board of Trade declined 0.7 percent to
$7.3225 a bushel in early trading, the lowest price for the
most-active contract since Nov. 16. Rain forecast for Brazil and
Argentina have improved the production outlook for the two
countries that are the largest shippers of the grain after the
U.S.  “The main reason for our low prices today is because the
U.S prices went down a lot,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from the white variety is one of the country’s staple
foods, while yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in March, the most active contract, fell
0.6 percent to 3,720 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
