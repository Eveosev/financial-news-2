OAO AvtoVAZ rose to the highest
level in more than four months on expectations  Renault SA (RNO)  and
 Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  will sign a final accord this week to raise
their holding in the largest Russian passenger-car producer.  AvtoVAZ jumped as much as 10 percent and traded up 7.1
percent at 16.901 rubles at 12:11 p.m. in Moscow, the highest
since July 20. The stock surged 17 percent on Dec. 7.  Renault and Nissan will sign the agreement with state-run
Russian Technologies Corp. by the middle of this month to boost
its holding to about 50 percent, Interfax said last week.
Russiaâ€™s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service approved the deal in
September. Renault holds 25 percent in AvtoVAZ.  Renault and Nissan will jointly invest about $750 million
to take a more than 67 percent stake in a joint venture with
Russian Technologies that will in turn own 74.5 percent of
AvtoVAZ, under a deal set to be completed by 2014, the companies
said May 3.  Russian Technologies spokesman Valery Kartavtsev and
Moscow-based Renault spokeswoman Oxana Nazarova declined to
comment on the timing when called by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
