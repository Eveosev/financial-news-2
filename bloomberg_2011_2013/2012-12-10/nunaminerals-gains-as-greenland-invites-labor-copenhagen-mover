NunaMinerals A/S (NUNA) , which is looking
for gold in Greenland, rose to the highest price in 19 months in
Copenhagen trading after the arctic island passed a law making
it easier for its  mining industry  to attract foreign labor.  NunaMinerals rose as much as 16 percent to 220 kroner, the
highest since May 2011, making it today’s biggest winner in the
 Copenhagen all-share index . The stock advanced 15 percent to 217
kroner at 10:26 a.m. in the Danish capital with trading volume
at 180 percent of the three-month daily average.  The legislation, which was passed late Dec. 7, aims to make
it easier to complete large-scale projects by reducing labor
costs based on international wage levels, Greenland’s government
said in a statement. NunaMinerals, which is based in the
island’s capital city, Nuuk, is developing more than a dozen
mining prospects on the island, including deposits containing
gold, diamonds, rare earth minerals and copper.  Greenland’s Industry Minister Ove Karl Berthelsen met with
the  China Development Bank  and members of the Asian country’s
cabinet last month to discuss mining projects. Greenland, which
is part of the Kingdom of  Denmark , relies on income from fishing
and subsides from the Danish government for most of its economy.
Its government has invited mining companies and oil explorers
over the past decade to help tap its natural resources as it
seeks to diversify its economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
