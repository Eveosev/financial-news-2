Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , an  investment
company  controlled by Saudi  Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , is
seeking a loan for about $500 million to help refinance existing
debt, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal.  The three-year facility is being self-arranged by the
company with Citigroup Inc. assisting as coordinator, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private. About six banks are expected to participate in the
loan, which is due to sign mid-January, the person said.  Billionaire Alwaleed owns a 95 percent stake in the
investment company which is building a 1 kilometer high
skyscraper in Jeddah, surpassing the Burj Khalifa in Dubai as
the worldâ€™s tallest tower. Kingdom Holding said it completed the
financing for the $1.2 billion project in September, without
disclosing the amount.  The company did not immediately reply to an e-mail seeking
comment on the financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
