The U.S. regulator of Fannie Mae and
 Freddie Mac (FMCC)  should keep a closer watch on the salaries the two
government-owned mortgage finance companies pay to senior
executives, according to an auditor’s  report  released today.  “The agency’s lack of independent assessment limits its
capacity to ensure that the costs associated with senior
professional compensation are warranted,” the Federal Housing
Finance Agency Office of Inspector General said in the report.  The two companies paid 90 executives a total of $92 million
and paid another 2,000 senior professionals a total of $455
million in 2011, the report said. Median compensation to vice
presidents was $388,000, while median pay for company directors
was $205,300.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have drawn almost $190 billion
in taxpayer aid since they were taken into U.S. conservatorship
in September of 2008 when investments in risky loans pushed them
to the brink of insolvency. They’ve paid a combined $50 billion
in dividends back to the U.S. Treasury.  Kelli Parsons, a spokeswoman for  Fannie Mae (FNMA) , said it’s
“critical” for the company to pay competitive salaries.  “Our people are the reason for Fannie Mae’s significant
progress, which is benefiting taxpayers,” Parsons said in an e-
mailed statement. “A change in our ability to pay competitive
salaries could stall or reverse this progress.”  The FHFA has frozen pay at the two companies and cut the
annual pay of the chief executive officers by almost 90 percent
to $600,000 each, from about $5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
