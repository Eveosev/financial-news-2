Stephen Jackson  of the  San Antonio
Spurs  was fined $25,000 by the National Basketball Association
for making a “hostile statement” on Twitter that was directed
at Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder.   NBA executive vice president of basketball operations Stu
Jackson announced the discipline in an e-mailed statement.   Jackson yesterday apologized for his Twitter comments, in
which he threatened to go after Ibaka the next time the Spurs
and Thunder meet. “It was unprofessional and childish,”
Jackson said. “I’m not a thug, just a man who speaks his mind.
It was not appropriate. I do apologize.”   San Antonio visits Oklahoma City on Dec. 17. The Spurs and
Thunder are tied for the NBA’s best record at 17-4.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
