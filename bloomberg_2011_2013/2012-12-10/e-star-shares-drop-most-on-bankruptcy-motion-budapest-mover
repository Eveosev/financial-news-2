E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR) , a Hungarian
energy supplier, plunged the most in more than six weeks after
the company filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 8.  The shares  plummeted  15 percent to 348 forint by 10:09 a.m.
in Budapest, the biggest decline since Oct. 24. The stock has
dived 92 percent this year as the company struggled to buy back
corporate bonds at discounts.  E-Star filed for bankruptcy citing its inability to meet
payment obligations, opening the right of its creditors to
initiate liquidation proceedings, E-Star said in a statement to
the Budapest bourse on Dec. 8. The company plans to reach an
agreement with its creditors under the bankruptcy procedure to
ensure future operation, according to the statement.  “We believe E-Star’s management will offer an exchange of
bonds for stocks but the fair value of E-Star’s shares would
drop significantly if Hungarian projects were taken over by
banks,” Peter Szentirmai, a Budapest-based analyst at KBC
Securities said in an e-mailed note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
