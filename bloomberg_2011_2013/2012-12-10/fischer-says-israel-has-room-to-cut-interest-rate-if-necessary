Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer said there is room to lower the benchmark interest rate
if needed, and expressed concern over the government’s budgetary
challenges.  The central bank kept its rate unchanged at 2 percent last
month after unexpectedly cutting it by a quarter-point in
October. There are signs that economic growth will continue, the
bank said when it held the rate.  “The economy is doing well in most respects and we’re
predicting growth for next year of 3 percent,” Fischer said
today at a Tel Aviv conference. “Clearly there’s room if
necessary to cut interest rates.”  Fischer said the bank will have keep a close eye on housing
prices and could use macro-prudential measures to lessen the
impact of rate cuts on the real estate market.  The government will have to cut about 15 billion shekels
($3.9 billion) of planned spending and may have to raise taxes
in order to lower the deficit, the governor said, adding
“that’s a huge budgetary problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
