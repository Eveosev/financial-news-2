Australia â€™s east coast may face a
natural gas supply shortfall amid growing local and Asian demand
should companies in the area fail to develop reserves in time,
according to the Australian Energy Market Operator.  A large quantity of the reserves in eastern Australia is
committed to the liquefied natural gas export projects being
built in Queensland state by  BG Group Plc (BG/) ,  Santos Ltd. (STO)  and
 ConocoPhillips (COP) , the operator said in an e-mailed report.  Australia also will need to invest A$4 billion ($4.2
billion) in electricity transmission networks over 20 years,
less than an earlier forecast of A$7 billion, because of slower
energy demand growth, the market operator said in a separate
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
