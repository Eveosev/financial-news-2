Gasoline at U.S. pumps dropped as
 oil prices  declined and refineries restored production of the
motor fuel after equipment shutdowns.  The national average price for regular, unleaded gasoline
fell 4.5 cents to $3.349 a gallon today from a week earlier, the
U.S. Energy Information Administration said in the  report  posted
on the agencyâ€™s website. The price was $3.286 a year ago.  Oil prices have dropped almost $7 a barrel since the end of
September on speculation that weak economic growth will reduce
fuel demand.  Gasoline inventories  in the U.S. rose 7.86 million
barrels in the seven days ended Nov. 30, the biggest weekly gain
since Sept. 21, 2001, Energy Department data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
