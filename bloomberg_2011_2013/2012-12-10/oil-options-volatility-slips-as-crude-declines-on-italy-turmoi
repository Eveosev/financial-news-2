Crude options volatility slipped as
oil declined on concern a leadership change in  Italy  will
disrupt efforts to curb  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.53 on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange at 4:20 p.m. New York time, up from 27.65 percent on
Dec. 7.  Crude for January delivery slid 37 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $85.56 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
lowest settlement since Nov. 15. Prices are down 13 percent this
year. The February contract slipped 40 cents to $86.10.  Prices sank to a three-week low as Italian Prime Minister
Mario Monti said he will resign, while his predecessor, Silvio
Berlusconi, announced he will run for the premiership to roll
back Monti’s budget tightening.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $85 puts, which slipped 10 cents to 78 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,750 lots. March $65 puts were next, with 2,642 lots
trading hands as they fell 1 cent to 15 cents.  Bets that prices would decline, or puts, accounted for 63
percent of the electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets made up 52 percent of
the 75,076 contracts traded.  February $105 calls were the most active options Dec. 7,
with 7,167 lots exchanged. They fell 1 cent to 12 cents a
barrel. February $70 puts followed, with 3,733 lots traded. They
were unchanged at 13 cents a barrel.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
45,795 contracts. Next were January $60 puts, at 34,922 lots,
and January $110 calls with 31,399.  To contact the reporter on this story:
