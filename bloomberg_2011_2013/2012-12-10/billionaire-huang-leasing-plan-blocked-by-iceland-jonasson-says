Iceland has rejected a $200 million
property investment bid by Chinese billionaire Huang Nubo in a
decision that was “categorical,” according to Interior
Minister Ogmundur Jonasson.  Huang’s “request to purchase or acquire the right of
disposal over Grimsstadir a Fjollum has been declined and I
don’t know how clearly this has to be said in order for the man
to understand,” Jonasson said in an op-ed piece published in
today’s DV newspaper. “To ensure that nobody misunderstands the
decision of the ministerial committee, it wasn’t postponed to
take a decision on the request of Huang Nubo’s conglomerate. The
request was denied.”  Huang had planned to develop a resort and a mountain park
in Iceland through his company, Beijing Zhongkun Investment
Group Co., he said last year. The planned acquisition of 300
square kilometers (116 square miles) of land would be a platform
from which to invest elsewhere in the Nordic region, he said.  The billionaire, who has properties in California and
 Tennessee , is known for helping restore the 200-year-old
villages Xidi and Hongcun around Huangshan mountain in  China ’s
eastern Anhui province, which are now included on the UNESCO
world heritage list. The company built and operates resorts near
the villages, according to Beijing Zhongkun’s website.  Telephone calls to Huang’s office in Beijing and to Yao
Chen, a public relations official at Zhongkun, weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
