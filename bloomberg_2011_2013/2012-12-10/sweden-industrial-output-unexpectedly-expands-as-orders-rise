Swedish industrial production
unexpectedly rose in October, easing pressure on the central
bank to cut  interest rates  this month.  Industrial production  rose 0.5 percent in October, after
declining a revised 4.2 percent the previous month, Stockholm-
based  Statistics Sweden  said today. Production was  estimated  to
be unchanged, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of nine economists. Output fell an annual 4.4 percent.  The central bank has signaled it may cut its benchmark rate
later this month, after three reductions since last year to 1.25
percent. Swedish growth is slowing amid falling export demand
from the debt-riddled euro area.  Industrial orders rose 1.6 percent in the month and were
2.1 percent lower in the year, Statistics Sweden said. Export
orders rose 3.2 percent, while domestic orders fell 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
