Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, in his first speech since being anointed President Hugo Chavez’s successor, tearfully pledged his loyalty to the
president and to revamp Chavez’s currency controls.  “Even beyond our life, we will be loyal to Hugo Chavez,”
Maduro said, speaking on state television, while shedding tears
and his voice cracked. “Chavez has been and is a father to us.
He trained us in anti-imperialism and ideas of a socialist
society.”  Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader who also
serves as foreign minister, said currency controls have worked
“very well” and “could be improved and they will.”  Chavez, in a nationwide address over the weekend, said he
was throwing his “irrevocable, absolute” support behind Maduro
to lead his so-called 21st century socialist revolution if he
isn’t able to carry out his duties. Chavez made the comments
before flying to Cuba before dawn today for surgery, his fourth
in 18 months, to treat an undisclosed form of cancer that
reappeared after winning re-election in October.  Speaking at an event to support former Vice President Elias Jaua’s bid for governor of Miranda state, Maduro asked those
present to pray daily for Chavez’s health.  To contact the reporters on this story:
