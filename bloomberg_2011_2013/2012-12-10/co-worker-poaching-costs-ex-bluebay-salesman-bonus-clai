A former salesman at  Royal Bank of
Canada (RY) ’s BlueBay Asset Management lost a lawsuit seeking payment
of a 1.7 million-pound ($2.7 million) bonus after a judge ruled
he tried to recruit other BlueBay workers for a competitor.  Fahim Imam-Sadeque left London-based BlueBay in 2011 to
join Goldbridge Capital Partners, a firm founded that year by
another former BlueBay employee, Gina Germano. BlueBay canceled
Imam-Sadeque’s 2012 stock award, saying it found evidence he
encouraged other employees to come to Goldbridge during lunch
meetings, phone calls and  text messages .  “I have little doubt that Mr. Imam-Sadeque was aware his
conduct in assisting in the set-up and launch of Goldbridge in
the way he did was a serious breach of his obligations and would
have warranted instant dismissal,” Judge Andrew Popplewell in
London said in a written decision.  Royal Bank of Canada  paid 963 million pounds for BlueBay in
2010 to expand its wealth-management business. Goldbridge  opened 
in October 2011 with $100 million of funding to invest in
distressed European debt.  Imam-Sadeque’s lawyer Peter De Maria didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  “BlueBay does not enjoy litigation,” the company said in
an e-mailed statement. “The firm does, however, require its
partners, employees and ex-employees to honor their obligations
to the firm, to tell the truth and to meet certain standards of
ethical behavior.”  Imam-Sadeque, who was paid a total of 2.5 million pounds
including bonuses while at BlueBay in 2011, must make an interim
payment of 375,000 pounds to cover the company’s legal costs,
the judge said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
