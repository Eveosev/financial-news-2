The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in Asia from non-payment fell to the lowest in a
week, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased 0.5 of a basis point to 113
basis points as of 8:23 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole  SA
prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest close since Dec. 3,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 0.5 of a basis point
to 170 as of 9:23 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
index is on track for its lowest close since Dec. 5, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at
126.5 basis points as of 11:23 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Credit Agricole. The index fell 3.6 basis points last week, CMA
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
