The  Institute of International
Finance , which represents more than 450 financial companies,
appointed former U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Tim Adams as its
next managing director.  Adams, currently managing director of the Lindsey Group, an
economic consultancy in Fairfax,  Virginia , will join the
Washington-based group on Jan. 1 and take its helm a month
later, the IIF said in a statement today.  He will replace Charles Dallara, also a former Treasury
official, who announced his decision to step down in June after
leading negotiations for private creditors in  Greece ’s debt
swap.  Adams was the Treasury’s undersecretary for international
affairs in President George W. Bush’s administration from 2005
to 2007, serving as the department’s point man on  China ,
currency markets and the International Monetary Fund.  Adams was an adviser on Bush’s two campaigns for the White
House and served as Treasury’s chief of staff during his first
term. He also worked in the White House of President George H.W. Bush and co-founded the G-7 Group, an advisory firm.  “From a broad field of contenders, Tim Adams clearly stood
out,” Douglas Flint, chairman of the IIF’s board and chairman
of HSBC Holdings Plc, said in a statement. “He brings to the
IIF an enviable range of skills and experience, from both the
public and private sectors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
