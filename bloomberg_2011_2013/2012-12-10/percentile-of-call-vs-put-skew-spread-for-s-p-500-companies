The following table shows the percentile rank
over the past year for the 90%-110% skew spread, a measure of how expensive
puts, or bearish bets, are relative to calls. The data was calculated using
30-day implied volatility of  S&P 500  companies. The stocks in the screen had
a daily average of more than 500 contracts trading in the past 20 days and
an open interest of more than 10,000 options, according to data as of Dec. 7
compiled by Bloomberg. To see the skew data from the Bloomberg Function:
{IBM US <EQUITY> GV <GO>}, or use the attached screen for selections {97 <GO>}.  SOURCE: Bloomberg  Definition:
90%-110% Skew Spread: Calculated as the difference of 90% and 110%
moneyness options for 30-day implied volatility data, using the Black-Scholes
model. The implied volatility value is computed across expirations using the
Hermite spline interpolation method and across strikes using the quadratic
fitting interpolation technique.  Criteria:
All companies shown in this table had an average daily options volume
of at least 500 contracts for the past 20 days and an open interest of
more than 10,000 as of the last trading day.  -- With assistance from Cecile Vannucci and Timothy Mazzella.  To contact the reporter on this story:
