Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  said Chief
Operating Officer David E. Roberts Jr., once viewed as a
possible successor to Chief Executive Officer Clarence Cazalot,
is resigning to pursue other interests.  The resignation will be effective Dec. 14, Houston-based
Marathon said in a statement today. Lee Warren, a company
spokeswoman, declined to give his age or specify why Roberts is
leaving the company.  Roberts joined Marathon in 2006 as the senior vice
president for business development and became the executive vice
president of upstream, which includes exploration and
production, in 2008. He was named COO when the company spun off
its refining operations last year and Cazalot, 62, became
chairman and CEO.  “I’m surprised,” said Philip Weiss, an analyst at Argus
Research in New York who rates the shares at hold and owns none.
“I think of him as being highly regarded, as being a good solid
number two.”  Marathon fell 1.8 percent to $30.36 at the close in New
York. The shares, which have 16 buy and seven hold ratings from
analysts, have climbed 3.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
