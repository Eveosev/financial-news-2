Saudi National Petrochemical Co. (YANSAB) 
fell to a four-month low after the company known as Petrochem
said it had a loss of 264 million riyals ($70 million) in
October and November as its polymers plant remains shut.  The stock fell 5.6 percent to 18.6 riyals, the lowest since
July 25, at the close in  Riyadh . The shares helped push the
benchmark  Saudi Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  down 0.6 percent, the
most since Nov. 27. About 2.5 million Petrochem shares were
traded today, more than five times the three-month daily
average.  “The detail of the loss numbers for the two months may
have triggered a negative reaction from investors,” Muhammad Faisal Potrik, an analyst at Riyad Capital, said by phone today.
“As the plant is still shut down, the loss is only expected to
increase.”  Petrochem said yesterday it would delay resuming operations
of its polymers plant until January from December. The company
suspended productions at the plant Nov. 10 and said at the time
the shutdown would reflect on its  fourth-quarter results.   Petrochem’s shares have dropped 9.3 percent so far this
year, compared with a drop of 7.2 percent for the Tadawul All
Share Petrochemical Industries Index and a gain of 5.1 percent
for the benchmark  stock index . Potrik has a  buy recommendation 
on the stock while three analysts say hold and two say sell.  “I may revisit my assumptions on the stock,” Potrik said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
