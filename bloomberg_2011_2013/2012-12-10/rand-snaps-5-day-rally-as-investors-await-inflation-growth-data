The rand declined for the first time
in six days, retreating from a one-month high against the dollar
before the release of data this week expected to show that
prices are rising as the economy slows.  South Africa ’s currency retreated 0.4 percent to 8.6863 a
dollar as of 4:15 p.m. in Johannesburg, after climbing as much
as 0.4 percent on Nov. 7 to 8.6500, the strongest level since
Nov. 8. Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.35
percent.  Consumer prices in  Africa ’s largest economy rose 5.6
percent in November from a year earlier, unchanged from the
month before,  according to the median estimate of economists in
a Bloomberg survey. Mining production probably dropped 2.9
percent in October while manufacturing grew 0.3 percent,
separate surveys show.  “The inflation data will in the main reflect an elevated
price pressure environment while the manufacturing data will
confirm a weak underlying productive base,” Quinten Bertenshaw,
a Johannesburg-based analyst at ETM Analytics, said in e-mailed
comments. “It is not the kind of environment where the rand is
likely to perform particularly well.”  ETM is advising clients to buy dollars at dips below 8.65
rand.  Bond yields fell before the year’s last fixed-rate
government bond auction tomorrow, and as bondholders reinvested
interest payments due this month, according to Thando Vokwana, a
bond trader at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg.  “Reinvestment of coupons has seen bond yields,
particularly backend stock, plummet,” Vokwana wrote in a note
e-mailed to clients. Yields on 2026 securities have dropped 25
basis points since the beginning of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
