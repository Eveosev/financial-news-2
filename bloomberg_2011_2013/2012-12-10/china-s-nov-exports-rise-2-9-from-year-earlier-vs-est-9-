China ’s exports rose 2.9 percent in November from a year earlier while imports were unchanged, leaving a  trade surplus  of $19.6 billion, the customs administration said today in Beijing.  The growth in overseas shipments compares with the 9 percent median estimate of 31 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and an 11.6 percent increase the previous month.  Imports compare with the median estimate for an increase of 2 percent and a 2.4 percent rise in October. The trade surplus compared with the median projection for a $26.9 billion excess.  Reports yesterday showed industrial output rose 10.1 percent in November from a year earlier and retail sales climbed 14.9 percent, both the fastest pace since March. Inflation rebounded from a 33-month low to 2 percent. Fixed-asset investment excluding rural households increased 20.7 percent in the first 11 months of the year, a pace unchanged from the January-to-October period.
