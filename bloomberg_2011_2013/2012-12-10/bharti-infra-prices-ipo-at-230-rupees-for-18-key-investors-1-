Bharti Infratel Ltd. (BHIN) , attempting
 India ’s largest initial public offering in more than two years,
is selling 28.3 million shares to 18 key investors at 230 rupees
apiece, according to a company statement.  Bharti Infratel, the mobile tower unit of India’s largest
wireless operator, is seeking to raise as much as 45.3 billion
rupees ($834 million) in the IPO. At 230 rupees a share, the
company will raise 6.5 billion rupees ($119.5 million) from the
anchor investors, which are institutional investors required to
hold the shares for at least 30 days, the company said today.  The shares being sold to such investors represent 15
percent of the total offering, Bharti Infratel said. Demand from
anchor investors amounted to about $800 million of the shares,
two people with knowledge of the matter said before the
announcement. The IPO will be open to other investors from Dec.
11 to Dec. 14, according to the company.  Anchor investors that have been alloted shares include
Alliance Bernstein, Wellington Management Co., Columbia Acorn
International and Route One Investment Co., Bharti Infratel
said.  The share sale, the largest since state-owned  Coal India
Ltd. (COAL) ’s $3.5 billion sale in October 2010, marks the revival of
the IPO market after India’s benchmark  Sensex index  rose almost
26 percent, reaching a 19-month high on Nov. 30. The IPO of the
unit of  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  will provide an exit for companies
such as Temasek Holdings Pte,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and
 Citigroup Inc. (C) , which bought a $1 billion stake in 2007.  Other Bharti Infratel investors include  KKR & Co. (KKR) , the
leveraged-buyout firm led by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts ,
which agreed in February 2008 to invest $250 million in a deal
that valued the company at $12.5 billion.  Bharti has hired  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ,  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) ,  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Bank of America  Merrill Lynch, Enam
Securities Pvt.,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Kotak Mahindra Capital Co.,
Deutsche Bank AG and  UBS AG (UBSN)  for the tower unit sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
