(Corrects that OPEC meets this week in second paragraph of
story published yesterday.)  Iraq  plans to boost oil production to
as much as 3.8 million barrels a day in 2013, matching the
record reached in 1979, the country’s oil minister said.  The Arab nation will export 2.9 million barrels a day in
2013, from 2.6 million last month, Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi told
reporters in Vienna, where he is attending this week’s OPEC
meeting. The country aims to build a 1 million-barrel-a-day
pipeline to  Jordan , he said.  “We plan to increase production, and we may reach 3.8
million barrels a day by the end of next year, which would meet
the record high in 1979,” al-Luaibi said. The country is
pumping more than 3.4 million barrels a day currently, he said.  Iraq, which has held a payment to the Kurdistan Regional
Government for its share of exports, said it will pay the amount
only if the semi-autonomous region agrees to meet a 2013 export
target of 250,000 barrels a day and provides accounting of sales
and production since 2008, he said.  The Iraqi government will hold a roadshow on Dec. 14 in
 London  for the construction of a pipeline to export crude oil
through Jordan’s Red Sea port of Aqaba, he said. The pipeline’s
capacity will include 150,000 barrels to Jordan’s refinery in
Zarqa, al-Luaibi said.  The government’s plans include construction of a second
export pipeline through  Syria  with a capacity of 1 million
barrels, once unrest in the neighboring country ends, he said.  Iraq will pursue legal action against companies that are
buying crude smuggled from the Kurdish region, mainly through
neighboring Turkey and  Iran , he said.  The Oil Ministry plans to hold an auction for 10 natural
gas blocks in the first half of next year, al-Luaibi said. The
ministry will offer better contract terms to the companies than
those in the last round in May, when only four out of 12 blocks
were awarded, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
