Supply, demand and price of EU
allowances, United Nations Certified Emission Reductions and UN
Emission Reduction Units may not be immediately impacted by Doha
climate decisions, says Daniel Rossetto, managing director of
Climate Mundial Ltd., a London-based consulting company that
works in carbon markets. He was speaking yesterday in an e-
mailed response to questions.  EU permits for December fell as much as 3.8 percent to 6.52
euros ($8.41) a metric ton at 7:56 a.m. on  London ’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange. CERs declined 6.5 percent to 58 cents.  On the amendments to the  Kyoto Protocol  agreed in Doha:  “Kyoto has now effectively become a framework for
 developing countries  plus Kazakhstan and Ukraine to engage with
Australia’s and the EU’s carbon markets. So it will not be until
new decisions are made by the EU and Australia regarding caps
and rules under those schemes, including new qualitative
restrictions on offset units or linking agreements, that prices
will be affected.”  On ERUs:  “Getting ERUs issued out of Russia is a very time-
consuming process and the Ministry for Economic Development may
not, under Russian law, issue an ERU unless there is an
accompanying verification report produced by an accredited audit
firm. In the end the market will see that  Russia ’s procedures
for issuing Emission Reduction Units were actually very tight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
