A Maryland insurance broker was
sentenced to 15 years in prison for stealing almost $2.6 million
by submitting fraudulent bills to the Perth Amboy,  New Jersey ,
board of education.  Francis Gartland, 71, of Baltimore, also stole $216,495
from the city of Perth Amboy in payments for a nonexistent
wellness program, according to a release from the office of New
Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa.  “This crooked broker stole millions of dollars from the
Perth Amboy School District, which needed the money to educate
its children,” Chiesa said in the release. “This is the worst
type of corruption.”  Gartland pleaded guilty in April to first-degree  money
laundering  and second-degree theft by deception. He and his
companies, including Gartland and Co. Inc. and Federal Hill Risk
Management LLC, were ordered to pay restitution in the amounts
stolen. He was sentenced to state prison in New Jersey by
Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz in  Middlesex County .  Gartland was the broker for health-benefits insurance for
the board of education and acted on the board’s behalf with
insurance carriers, according to the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
