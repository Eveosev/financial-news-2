A regional referendum held in
central Romania yesterday on the resumption of mining at  Gabriel
Resources Ltd. (GBU) â€™s Rosia Montana gold mine project was invalidated
because of lower-than-required turnout, Mediafax  reported today ,
citing the Electoral Commission from Alba County.  Turnout was 43.20 percent at the referendum, below the 50
percent threshold needed to validate the vote, the Bucharest-
based news service quoted the electoral commission as saying.
About 62 percent of the citizens that cast a ballot voted in
favor of restarting the gold mine project, while 35 percent
voted against it, according to Mediafax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
