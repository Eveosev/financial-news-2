European investor confidence
increased for a fourth month in December as the  European Central
Bank ’s pledge to save the euro calmed financial markets, the
Sentix research institute said.  An  index  measuring sentiment in the euro-area economy
increased to minus 16.8 from minus 18.8 in November, the
Limburg, Germany-based institute said in an e-mailed statement
today. Economists had forecast a gain to minus 16.9, according
to the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. A
gauge of economic expectations climbed to minus 1.5 from minus
5.5, while a measure of current conditions rose to minus 31 from
minus 31.3, Sentix said.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  announced in July he would do
whatever is needed to preserve the euro. He introduced an
unlimited government bond-purchase program in September and
investors are now waiting for Spain to apply for aid from
 Europe ’s bailout fund, a condition for the ECB to intervene in
debt markets.  While Draghi hasn’t been able “to eliminate all doubts”
about the future of the euro, the ECB’s pledge “has changed the
situation for the better,”  Sebastian Wanke , senior analyst at
Sentix, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
