Iron-ore  shipments from  Australia ,
the world’s biggest shipper of the steel-making ingredient,
advanced to a record in October as a strengthening Chinese
economy boosted demand.  Exports gained 7.6 percent from September to 44.2 million
metric tons, according to government data compiled by Bloomberg.
Shipments to  China  climbed 11 percent to 34 million tons, the
data show.  China’s industrial output surged 10.1 percent in November
from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said
yesterday, after advancing 9.6 percent in October. The data
bolster prospects that the world’s second-largest economy and
the biggest buyer of iron ore is set to rebound after a seven-
quarter slowdown. Gross domestic product may expand 7.7 percent
in the three months through December from a year earlier,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Iron ore with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin  climbed  2.2 percent to $121 a dry ton on Dec. 7,
the highest since Nov. 19, according to data compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd. Prices gained 14 percent in October after
advancing 17 percent in September.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) , Australia’s third-biggest iron
ore producer, climbed 7 percent to A$4.055 as of 2:10 p.m. in
Sydney. Rio Tinto Ltd. gained 2.1 percent to A$61.42, while  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  rose 0.9 percent to A$35.05.  To contact the reporters for this story:
