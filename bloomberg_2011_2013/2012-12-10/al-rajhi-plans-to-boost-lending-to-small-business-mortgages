Al Rajhi Bank, (RJHI)  the largest Saudi
Arabian bank by market value, plans to offer more mortgages next
year and step up loans to small and medium enterprises and
project finance to diversify its portfolio.  The bank is expecting growth in lending next year similar
to this year’s, Chief Executive Officer Sulaiman Al Zaben said
in an interview in Manama, Bahrain today, without giving
details.  “I think consumers are getting too many loans now,” he
said. “We will keep lending to consumers but we want to expand
with lending in other areas,” he said.  Al Zaben said that he expects to see more mortgage lending
next year as Saudi Arabia is developing a new law. Based on
that, residential lending may rise to about $32 billion
annually, according to estimates by  Capitas Group International 
Ltd., a Saudi company focused on  Islamic finance .  Economic growth in Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil
exporter, will slow to 6 percent this year from 7.1 percent last
year, according to the World Economic Outlook by the
International Monetary Fund.  “Lending to SMEs is definitely an area where we want to
grow next year,” Al Zaben said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
