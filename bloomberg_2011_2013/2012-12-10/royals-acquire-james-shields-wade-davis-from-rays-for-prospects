The Kansas City Royals acquired
right-handed pitchers  James Shields  and Wade Davis from the
Tampa Bay Rays for four prospects, including outfielder Wil
Myers, who was voted the minor league player of the year by
 Baseball America  and  USA Today .  Shields, 30, had a 83-73 record with a 3.89 earned run
average over seven Major League Baseball seasons with the Rays
and is the franchise’s all-time leader in wins, starts and
innings pitched. He was the team’s Opening Day starter four
times, from 2008-10 and in 2012.  Shields went 15-10 with a 3.52 ERA last season, ranking
third in the American League with 227 2/3 innings pitched and
fourth with 223 strikeouts.  Davis, 27, moved to the bullpen last season after three
years as a starter and went 3-0 with a 2.43 ERA in 54 relief
appearances for Tampa Bay.  In addition to Myers, who turns 22 today, the Rays get
right-handed pitcher Jake Odorizzi, left-handed pitcher Mike
Montgomery and third baseman Patrick Leonard. Tampa Bay will
also send a player to be named to Kansas City.  Myers spent last season at the Double-A and Triple-A
levels, hitting a combined .314 with 37 home runs -- the second-
most in the minors -- and 109 runs batted in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
