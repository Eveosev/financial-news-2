A measure of job prospects fell in
November for the second time in the past three months,
indicating the U.S. job market will cool.  The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index decreased to
107.82 from 107.84 in October, the New York-based private
research group said today. The measure rose 3.3 percent from
November 2011.  “Employment growth over the next several months is likely
to slow again,”  Gad Levanon , director of macroeconomic research
at the Conference Board, said today in a statement. “Employment
growth typically lags economic growth, and with the economy
expected to decelerate in the current quarter and early 2013, a
slowdown in employment won’t be far behind.”  The report follows Labor Department data last week that
showed employers added more workers than projected in November
and the unemployment rate fell to the lowest level since
December 2008 as the workforce shrank. Faster hiring is needed
to spur consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the economy.  Payrolls rose by 146,000 last month following a revised
138,000 in October that was less than initially estimated,
the Labor Department said on Dec. 7. The median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a 85,000 advance.
Private payrolls, which exclude government agencies, grew by
147,000 after a revised gain of 189,000.  The jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent,
the Labor Department report also showed last week. Prior to
September, unemployment had been stuck above 8 percent for 43
consecutive months, the longest stretch in monthly records going
back to 1948.  Fed Policy  The lack of faster progress in the job market helps explain
why Federal Reserve policy makers are weighing additional easing
early next year to boost the economy. The central bank’s Federal
Open Market Committee meets this week.  The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market
indicators to forecast short-term hiring trends. On average, it
can signal a rebound in hiring as little as three months before
the fact and can predict job declines six to nine months in
advance, the Conference Board said.  The ETI’s drop last month was led by the surge in weekly
jobless claims in the wake of superstorm Sandy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
