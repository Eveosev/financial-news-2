The  European Central Bank ’s
 financing  to Portuguese lenders fell to the lowest level in nine
months in November.  ECB financing declined to 54.61 billion euros ($70.5
billion) from 56.09 billion euros in October, the Lisbon-based
Bank of Portugal said today on its website. That’s the lowest
since February, when financing was at 47.55 billion euros.  Portugal received a bailout in April 2011 under an aid plan
that earmarked as much as 12 billion euros for the
recapitalization of the country’s lenders. Under the program,
lenders were required to raise core Tier 1 capital ratios to 9
percent by the end of 2011 and 10 percent by the end of 2012.  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) ,  Portugal ’s biggest publicly traded
bank, in October sold the country’s first benchmark senior bank
bonds in more than two and a half years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
