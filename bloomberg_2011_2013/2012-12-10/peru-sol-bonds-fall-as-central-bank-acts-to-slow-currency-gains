Peru ’s sol-denominated bonds fell,
pushing up yields for the first time in two weeks, as central
bank efforts to slow appreciation in the local currency reduced
the debt’s allure.  The yield on the nation’s 8.6 percent bond due August 2017
climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.14
percent at 1:48 p.m. in  Lima , according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the first increase since Nov. 26. The price
fell 0.14 centimo to 123.4 centimos per sol.  The monetary authority has stepped up dollar purchases in
the spot market as the sol trades at a 16-year high. It bought
$60 million today after buying $60 million on Dec. 7, the most
in six weeks, according to data posted on its website. The bank
has purchased a record $13 billion this year as foreign direct
investment spurs growth.  “Fear of greater intervention” has probably damped demand
for the country’s bonds, said Kenneth Lam, a strategist at
Citigroup Global Markets in  New York . “The room for short-term
appreciation is becoming limited.”  The sol was little changed at 2.5715 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 2.5706 earlier today, which is the strongest
level since November 1996,  data  from Peru’s financial regulator
show.  The central bank will keep buying dollars in the  spot
market  every day while varying the amount and price of its
purchases to make it harder for speculators to predict the
currency’s moves, research director Adrian Armas said during a
Dec. 7 conference call with reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
