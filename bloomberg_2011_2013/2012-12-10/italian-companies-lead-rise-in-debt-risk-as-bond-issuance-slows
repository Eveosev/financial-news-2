Italian companies led an increase in
the cost of insuring European debt after the collapse of Prime
Minister  Mario Monti ’s government, while sales of corporate
bonds slowed.  Credit-default swaps on Enel SpA jumped 31 basis points to
246, UniCredit SpA climbed 30 to 325 and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA
rose 29 to 304, while Telecom Italia SpA was 15 higher at 292,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rome-based utility Enel
SpA’s bonds were the worst performers in Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s Euro Non-Financial Index of corporate securities.  Monti, an unelected technocrat who tried to enact changes
the previous government of  Silvio Berlusconi  was unwilling to
implement, said Dec. 8 he will resign because of parliamentary
opposition. Bond issuance slowed after last week’s busiest start
to a December since 2008, with only Belgian oil agency Apetra
and Finnish forester Tornator Oy tapping credit markets.  “Monti’s resignation demonstrates how vulnerable the cozy
suspension of disbelief on  Italy  has been,” said  Bill Blain , a
strategist at Mint Partners in  London . “It’s unlikely any new
government will be able to keep political support and enact the
much needed reforms Monti’s convinced us he’s been pushing
through.”  The yield premium on Rome-based Enel’s 3.5 percent bonds
due 2016 rose 28 basis points to 303 basis points relative to
German government debt, the biggest gap since Oct. 3, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Italy Risk  Credit-default swaps on Italy jumped 38 basis points, or 15
percent and the biggest increase in a year, to a three-week high
of 291. Swaps on Fiat SpA rose 28 basis points to 729. An
increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  “Populist forces and social unrest are mounting, and banks
are suffering from austerity, unemployment and bad loans,”
analysts led by  Alberto Gallo  at RBS wrote in a note to
investors. “Italy heads into 2013 without a stable
government.”  Yields on corporate bonds tightened one basis point last
week to 119 basis points, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s index, which tracks 948 investment-grade securities with
an average maturity of 5.4 years. The spread was 201 at the
start of the year.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed
two basis points to 482. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose one basis point to
120.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased five basis points to 158 and the
subordinated index rose seven to 270.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
