Nigeria’s police said they’re
searching for the kidnappers of Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala’s mother after she was abducted from her home in the
southern oil-rich Delta state yesterday.  Police spokesman Frank Mba in Abuja declined to comment on
whether authorities know the identity or the motives of the
kidnappers, in order to safeguard the investigation.  “The police have commenced a massive manhunt for the
perpetrators of the crime,” Mba said today by phone. “The
police must spare no effort to ensure that Mrs. Kamene Okonjo is
rescued unhurt, reunited with her family and the perpetrators
brought to justice.”  Okonjo-Iweala, who took office in August last year, has
worked to reverse expansionary budgets and backed President
Goodluck Jonathan’s move to cut a subsidy on gasoline in
January. Under her tenure, the ministry also rejected subsidy
claims by gasoline importers that weren’t verified.  The Finance Ministry doesn’t know “whether those behind
this action are the same people who have made threats against
the Coordinating Minister in the recent past or other elements
with hostile motives,” Paul Nwabuikwu, a spokesman for the
minister, said an e-mailed statement yesterday. “No possibility
can be ruled out at this point.”  The incident took place in the town of Ogwashi-Uku, the
ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
