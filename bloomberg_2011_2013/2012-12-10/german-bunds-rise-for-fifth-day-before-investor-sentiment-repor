Italian  government bonds  slumped,
with the 10-year yield climbing by the most since August, after
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said he would resign as he has lost
support in Parliament.  Two-year yields jumped to the highest level since September
as former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  and his allies
withdrew support for Monti’s government, threatening to derail
passage of the 2013 budget. Italy is due to sell bonds and bills
this week. Spanish securities also dropped while French, Belgian
and Austrian 10-year yields fell to euro-era lows. Greek bonds
advanced as the country extended the deadline for a buyback of
its debt.  “We are seeing a selloff but I wouldn’t call it a panic
yet,” said Elwin de Groot, a senior economist at Rabobank
Nederland in Utrecht,  Netherlands . “The auction this week could
be an interesting litmus test for investors. This has also
created uncertainty for Europe-wide policy making.”  Italy ’s 10-year yield rose 29 basis points, or 0.29
percentage point, to 4.82 percent at 4:22 p.m. London time after
climbing as much as 38 basis points, the most since Aug. 2. The
5.5 percent bond due in November 2022 fell 2.36, or 23.60 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,293) face amount, to 105.75.  The  two-year  yield gained 33 basis points to 2.31 percent
after rising to 2.47 percent, the highest since Sept. 27.  Most Volatile  Volatility on Italian bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets, followed by those of Ireland and  Belgium , according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  Monti said Dec. 8 he will resign due to parliamentary
opposition from Berlusconi and his allies, who had previously
backed his government. The former prime minister said the same
day he will seek the premiership in next year’s election and
criticized his successor’s “German-centric” austerity program.
Monti is undecided whether to run for a second term, la
Repubblica said today, citing a telephone call with the premier.  Italian  10-year yields  have dropped from their high of 7.48
percent reached in November 2011 as Monti’s government
implemented austerity to put the country on track to bring its
deficit within the European Union’s limit of 3 percent of gross
domestic product this year.  Italian Auctions  Italy is scheduled to auction 6.5 billion euros of 364-day
bills on Dec. 12 and zero-coupon bonds the following day.  Investors should “be prepared for some further weakness
until the auction,”  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income
strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Milan, wrote today in a note to
clients. “It is important to stress, however, that the short-
term reaction will unlikely become entrenched in prices over a
more medium term horizon.”  Greece ’s 10-year bonds gained for a third day with the
yield falling 65 basis points to 13.81 percent, the lowest since
the debt was restructured in March. The price of the 2 percent
bond maturing in February 2023 climbed 1.97 to 41.81 percent of
face value.  The nation is giving investors until midday London time
tomorrow to offer their bond holdings under their buyback
program, the Public Debt Management Agency said today on its
website. Holders of securities already tendered can’t revoke or
modify their participation, the statement said. The original
deadline was 5 p.m. on Dec. 7.  Greece was near its target in the buyback with almost 30
billion euros offered, an official at the  Finance Ministry  said
yesterday on condition of anonymity, referring to the face value
of the securities.  German Bonds  German 10-year  yields  were little changed at 1.30 percent
after dropping to 1.26 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 3.  Two-year yields were at minus 0.075 percent after declining
to negative 0.092 percent, approaching the record minus 0.097
percent set Aug. 2. A negative yield means investors who hold
the security until it matures will receive less than they paid
to buy it.  French  10-year yields  dropped to a euro-era record 1.916
percent, before being little changed at 1.95 percent. Belgium’s
10-year rate fell to an all-time low 2.06 percent and  Austria ’s
slid to as little as 1.67 percent.  Germany ’s bunds, the region’s safest securities, gained
even as report showed the nation’s exports unexpectedly
increased in October.  German bonds returned 4.3 percent this year through last
week, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Spain ’s
debt gained 4.7 percent and Italy’s earned 20 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
