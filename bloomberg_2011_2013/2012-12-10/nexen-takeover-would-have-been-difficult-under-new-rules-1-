Cnooc Ltd.’s $15.1 billion takeover
of  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  would have been “difficult” under Canada’s new
foreign-takeover rules, Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver
said.  The Nexen deal, the largest foreign acquisition by a
Chinese company, “would have been difficult because it would
have to have been an exceptional situation,” Oliver told
reporters in Toronto today.  Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  introduced new foreign
investment guidelines Dec. 7, after approving Cnooc’s bid for
Nexen and the C$5.2 billion ($5.3 billion) bid by Petroliam
Nasional Bhd., Malaysia’s state-owned energy company, for
Calgary-based natural gas producer  Progress Energy Resources
Corp. (PRQ)  The approval of Cnooc’s bid marked the “end of a trend”
of oil-sands takeovers by state-controlled companies, Harper
said.  The new guidelines, which bar state-owned companies from
buying controlling interests in oil-sands businesses except
under “exceptional circumstances,” aren’t meant to
specifically target Chinese investment, Oliver said.  State-owned companies may have “broader objectives” than
private companies to impose political interests upon businesses
they operate, he said.  After the Nexen deal closes, foreign governments will
control 10 percent of Canada’s oil sands output, Oliver said.  Nexen shares rose 14.1 percent to C$26.57 at 10:28 a.m. in
