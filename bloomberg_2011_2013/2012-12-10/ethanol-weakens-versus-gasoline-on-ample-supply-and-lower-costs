Ethanol weakened against gasoline on
ample supply and lower costs to produce the biofuel.  The difference between the two fuels widened to 24.81 cents
from 22.24 cents Dec. 7, based on futures settlement prices. The
spread has averaged 61.84 cents this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  An Energy Department report last week showed ethanol
 stockpiles  in the seven days ended Nov. 30 surged 5.4 percent to
19.3 million barrels, the highest level since July 27, while
 production  climbed 4 percent to 835,000 barrels a day, the
highest level since June 29.  “Since we saw the DOE report last week it feels like the
trade has backed off,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at
INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “Production rates are where
they need to be. Demand could be better. We have enough.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery dropped 2.5 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.35 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Nov. 15. Futures have climbed 6.7 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  added 3 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $2.525 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
jumped 3 cents to $2.425, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf climbed 2 cents to $2.48 a gallon
and on the West Coast the additive decreased 0.5 cent to $2.515.  Gasoline for January delivery gained 0.7 cent to settle at
$2.5981 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn Futures  Corn for March delivery fell 7.25 cents, or 1 percent, to
$7.30 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Ethanol producers have cut supply as corn prices jumped 12
percent this year because of the worst drought in 56 years.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from Dec. 7, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from the
sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  Companies have also faced increased competition from
imports as a 54-cent tariff on Brazilian supply expired in 2011
and distillers in that market, who use sugarcane, have cheaper
manufacturing costs, Blackford said.  Ethanol imports rose to 92,000 barrels a day in the week
ended Nov. 30, from 27,000 the previous week and 12,000 a year
earlier, Energy Department  data  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
