Halozyme Therapeutics Inc. (HALO)  gained
after a filing by partner  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  with European
regulators triggered a $4 million milestone payment.  Halozyme  gained  3.5 percent to $5.94 at the close of New
York trading. The San Diego-based company has declined 39
percent in the past 12 months.  Halozyme said two days ago that Roche had submitted a line
extension application with the European Medicines Agency for a
subcutaneous formulation of MabThera for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
That formulation of the medicine, which would shorten treatment
times, uses Halozyme technology that Roche licensed in 2006 for
as much as $612 million. Halozyme’s technology enables the
injection of large amounts of medication under the skin so
patients can receive an injection rather than an IV infusion.  “Offering a subcutaneous formulation of MabThera could
provide patients with a therapy which is less invasive, shortens
administration times and potentially reduces health-care
costs,”  Gregory I. Frost, Halozyme’s chief executive officer,
said in a statement two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
