South  Korea  is considering allowing
non-state companies to generate coal-fired power for the first
time in three decades, as it adds capacity to prevent blackouts
that cost the economy $11 billion.  “It will be good to allow a certain number of private coal
power generators,” Nam Ho Ki, the chairman of  Korea Power
Exchange , the government-run company that oversees the country’s
power supply and is helping to decide on the new policy, said in
an interview in Seoul last week. “We are positively considering
that option.”  Korea Power is aiming to decide on more than 30
applications from state and private companies to build new
plants by the end of the year, as part of its review with the
government of the nation’s energy mix, Nam said.  South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, should retain
its equal weighting between coal, natural gas and nuclear, said
Nam, who is 62 year old. And, while he can’t see the country
dropping nuclear power, neither does he foresee non-government
controlled companies entering the business, after a unit of
steelmaker Posco Group made and then withdrew an application to
build a nuclear plant.  Nam, who began his career in 1968 at  Korea Electric Power
Corp. (015760) , or Kepco, became chairman of Korea Power Exchange in
November 2011, after his predecessor resigned following
nationwide blackouts in September, the first since 2001.  Posco, Tongyang  Among private applicants for coal power plants are units of
Posco Group, Tongyang Group, SK Group, Dongbu Group, and STX
Group, who benefit from their control of the supply chain, he
said. It costs 3 trillion won to 3.2 trillion won to build a
2,000-megawatt coal generator.  “Private power generators believe they can cut costs by 20
percent to 30 percent by bringing in coal from their invested
mines or using their shipping lines,” Nam said. “We assess
that many of their intentions are commercially feasible.”  Private coal plant operators sold out to Kepco in 1982.  South Korea is vulnerable to blackouts after the government
miscalculated demand when planning power plants over the last
decade. Some projects were either canceled or delayed because
South Korea caps electricity prices to control inflation.
Monopoly power distributor Kepco has reported operating losses
since 2008. Kepco’s president resigned last month, having failed
to win a big enough increase in tariffs.  Blackout Looms  The Ministry of Knowledge Economy estimated in June 2012
that such “uncontrolled power supply reductions” cut gross
domestic product by 11.6 trillion won ($10.7 billion) each time
they occur, the equivalent of 1.1 percent of the value of goods
and services produced in the country last year.  Another blackout looms this winter because of forecasts for
unusually cold temperatures and possible supply interruptions
because of the unscheduled shuttering of two nuclear reactors on
Nov. 5. South Korea has sounded power demand alerts five times
in December after reserve capacity plunged to near or below the
4,000-megawatt safety threshold.  Two reactors at Yonggwang nuclear plant were closed to
replace components supplied with faked quality accreditation.
The chief executive officer at Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power,
which runs the plant, said Nov. 7 that he would quit after
“rectifying the mess” caused by the scandal.  National power reserves may range between 3,430 megawatts
and 4,830 megawatts this week, the ministry said Dec. 6.  Raise Prices  “A solution to resolve the power shortage is to raise
electricity tariffs and the increase should be up to the level
that people begrudge every penny,” said Nam. “There’s no other
solution for the moment, except to spread out power demand by
giving incentives. In terms of costs, power-demand management is
cheaper than building a power plant.”  Korea Power Exchange buys electricity from generators for
100 won per kilowatt-hour on average, while power generating
costs are 40 won from nuclear, 60 to 70 won from coal, and 130
to 140 won from natural gas, Nam said.  The country’s weighting on nuclear power generation will
probably remain intact, even as some presidential candidates for
the Dec. 19 election claim they would shut down reactors, Nam
said. Korea has 23 reactors with two more due to come online
next year.  “A successful candidate could restrict construction of new
reactors or shift to other fuel sources when an existing reactor
reaches its lifespan,” Nam said. “Any decision would be linked
to the burden on citizens. It’s doubtful whether a next
president could drop nuclear energy.”  Unlike  Japan , which is considering its nuclear future in
the wake of the Fukushima disaster last year, Korea doesn’t have
the power reserves to remove nuclear from its energy mix, he
said.  Different Approach  “It’s inevitable for our country to approach nuclear
energy policies differently than Japan,” Nam said. “Japan shut
down all reactors after the March disaster and conducted safety
check-ups on all of them. They could as they had abundant
reserve ratios, which exceeded 36 percent of their demand, and
their electricity tariff was three times that in our country.”  Posco (005490)  Engineering & Construction Co., a unit of Asia’s
third largest steelmaker, submitted an application to build a
reactor in Samcheok, southeast of Seoul, and then withdrew it
after the ministry selected state-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear
Power as the operator for a new reactor in that city in
September, said company spokesman Kim Hyun Joon.  “A state operator’s top priority is to avoid any accident
related to safety even as that possibility is very rare, once a
century,” said Nam. “It’s doubtful whether a private operator
can do that as a profit-seeking entity.”  Nam cautioned against increasing the weighting for natural
gas in Korea’s energy mix, despite the boom in projects to
extract gas from shale in the U.S.  “It’s not our holding. No one knows whether the U.S.
government will keep its export stance like this. It’s risky to
bet the boom would drag down gas prices significantly and
sustainably,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
