Air France-KLM Group (AF)  plans to cut
 capital spending  by a further 500 million euros ($645 million)
over the next two years as  Europe ’s biggest airline trims
investments in a push to pare debt and lift profit margins.  The outlay will be reduced by 300 million euros next year
and 200 million euros in 2014, the Paris-based company said
today in a statement, adding that  operating profit  should reach
a level equivalent to 6 to 8 percent of sales in 2015.  Air France-KLM’s Transform 2015 plan is seeking to shave 10
percent from non-fuel costs and cut net debt by 2 billion euros.
The capital-spending curbs, which may crimp jet purchases, will
pare investment next year to 1.2 billion euros, including a 200-
million euro reduction to the initial target announced in July.  “This is a necessary reduction, but given the group’s
younger fleet age versus competitors they have the flexibility
to do it,” said analyst Donal O’Neill at  Goodbody Stockbrokers 
in Dublin, who has a “buy” rating on the stock. “The Transform
plan is gathering pace and should be well on track to deliver.”  Employee Exits  Employee expenses will be reduced by 400 million euros by
2014, aided by 735 departures already secured, and the medium-
haul business should break even that year as the fleet is
reduced by 34 aircraft, Air France-KLM said prior to an investor
briefing at Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport today.  Chief Executive Officer Jean-Cyril Spinetta said in June he
would eliminate more than 5,000 jobs at the main French unit to
deliver savings he reckons are needed to guarantee survival.  The cut in capital spending is being driven by a “headwind”
of high fuel costs, “but does show the group’s determination to
deliver on targets,” said  Stephen Furlong , an analyst at Davy
Holdings in Dublin who rates the stock “underperform.”  Air France-KLM expects a 500 million-euro annual operating
loss from French medium-haul flights alone, spokeswoman Brigitte Barrand said, reiterating comments at the investor event, which
was closed to reporters. That’s unchanged from a year earlier.  Shares of Air France-KLM, which is folding the Brit Air,
Regional and Airlinair units that connect smaller cities into a
single business, traded 0.9 percent lower at 7.05 euros as of
4:20 p.m. in the French capital. They’ve gained 77 percent so
far this year, valuing the company at 2.12 billion euros.  Lufthansa, IAG  Rival carriers are also seeking to slash costs.  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Europe’s second-biggest, plans to save 1.5 billion
euros by 2015 through its Score plan, which in addition to 4,500
job cuts includes the folding of short-haul operations outside
Frankfurt and Munich into the Germanwings low-cost unit.  The Cologne-based company has also scrapped routes, frozen
capacity and delayed an upgrade of the inter-continental fleet.  At European No. 3  International Consolidated Airlines Group
SA (IAG) , the British Airways unit is seeking voluntary departures
among 2,338 senior cabin crew at  London ’s Heathrow airport and
Spanish division Iberia plans 4,500 job cuts, prompting unions
to call a six-day strike in the run up to Christmas.  Air France-KLM’s capital-spending cuts will see investment
in 2014 fall to 1.4 billion euros, reversing an increase for
that year announced on July 30, when the carrier had said it was
reining in the outlay for this year and 2013. Expenditure
totaled 2.1 billion euros in 2011.  Adopting new accounting standards for pensions will have a
1.1 billion-euro negative impact on opening equity next year,
though there’ll be no cash impact, the carrier said today.  Air France-KLM had an 895 million-euro loss in the second-
quarter, versus 197 million euros a year earlier, as it posted
charges of 368 million euros for payments linked to job cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
