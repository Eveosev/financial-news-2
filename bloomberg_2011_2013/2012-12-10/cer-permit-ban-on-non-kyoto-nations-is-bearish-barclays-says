Restrictions on the use of United
Nations Certified Emissions Reductions by countries not joining
the second period of the  Kyoto Protocol  may cause CER prices to
fall, Barclays Plc said.  Negotiators agreed last week in Doha to ban countries which
don’t commit to binding emission-reduction targets from 2013
from using CERs to meet their greenhouse-gas reduction targets.
Kyoto’s second period, known as CP2 or KP2, starts in January.  “While seemingly shrinking the market for CERs, the
post-2012 call on CERs from countries not agreeing KP2 targets
was always seen as extremely limited,”  Trevor Sikorski , an
analyst at the bank in  London , said in an e-mailed note today.
“If anything, it is bearish CER prices but with CER prices
already so low, the remaining downside is tiny.”  CERs for December fell to a record 57 euro cents ($0.74)  a
metric ton on Dec. 4 and were at 60 cents on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange as of 3:54 p.m. London time. Carbon offset and
permit prices slumped this year as the euro-area recession
damped industrial output and emissions.  Clean Development Mechanism projects may issue as many as 7
billion CERs by 2020, according to  projections  from the UN
Environment Programme’s Risoe Centre in Roskilde,  Denmark .
Companies in the European Union’s emissions-trading system may
use 1.2 billion CERs for compliance in the five years through
2012, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
