Yuan  forwards gained after China’s
central bank set a stronger fixing and reports on factory output
and consumer spending added to signs the world’s second-largest
economy is recovering.  Industrial production climbed  10.1 percent  in November from
a year earlier, and retail sales growth accelerated to 14.9
percent, beating economists’ estimates in Bloomberg surveys, the
statistics bureau said yesterday. Inflation was 2 percent,
quickening from a 33-month low of 1.7 percent in October. Export
data released today showed external demand for the nation’s
goods is weakening amid the global slowdown. The People’s Bank
of China strengthened the reference rate for the first time in
three days.  “The market is still expecting some gradual appreciation
and there is a major theme the market is playing, which is for
the year-end fixing to be a lot lower than the current level,”
said Leo Chan, head of regional foreign-exchange and interest-
rate trading in Hong Kong at ABN Amro Bank NV. “If  China  does
recover in a big way, and we are seeing some evidence of that,
we do expect a conservative 3 percent appreciation next year.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.02 percent
to 6.3145 per dollar in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, halting a two-day decline. The central bank set its
reference rate at 6.2922 versus a three-week low of 6.2930 on
Dec. 7. In offshore market, the yuan spot rate was little
changed at 6.2098 per dollar.  In  Shanghai , the currency traded at 6.2293 per dollar, the
upper limit of its 1 percent trading band, for most of the day
before closing 0.24 percent weaker at 6.2451, according to China
Foreign Exchange Trade System.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at 1.6
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The nation’s exports grew 2.9 percent last month from a
year earlier, short of the 9 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey and the 11.6 percent gain in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
