The pound strengthened for a fourth
day against the euro after Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti
said he intends to resign, boosting demand for the relative
safety of British assets.  Sterling rose against most of its 16 major peers after a
gauge of full-time hiring in the U.K. rose to a 19-month high.
Monti will try to persuade his coalition government to pass
budget legislation before handing in his “irrevocable
resignation,” President Giorgio Napolitano’s office said Dec.
8. Monti’s predecessor  Silvio Berlusconi  said on the same day he
will run for prime minister in next year’s election. U.K.
government bonds declined.  “We’re a bit risk off but we’re certainly not reaching any
sort of panic as of yet,” said Owen Callan, an analyst at
 Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Dublin. “With Berlusconi back on the scene
there’s a bit of extra uncertainty. We should see the safe
havens outperform for the first half of the week.”  The pound gained 0.2 percent to 80.44 pence per euro at
4:18 p.m. London time after appreciating to 80.33 pence, the
strongest level since Nov. 21. The U.K. currency advanced 0.2
percent to $1.6069.  Under Italian rules, an election may come as soon as
February. Monti will hand in his final resignation after making
an attempt to muster parliamentary support for the 2013 budget
law. Italy’s economy shrank for a fifth quarter in the three
months through September, a government report showed today.  U.K. Hiring  A gauge of permanent U.K. job placements climbed to 56 last
month from 55 in October, KPMG LLP and the Recruitment and
Employment Confederation said in an e-mailed report. Readings
above 50 indicate an increase. The data showed signs of
“cautious optimism,” the groups said.  Sterling has gained 1.4 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 2.6 percent and
the dollar fell 2.3 percent.  Gilts dropped for a second day, with the 10-year yield
rising three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.77
percent. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 fell 0.25,
or 2.50 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 99.82. The yield
earlier declined to 1.72 percent, the lowest since Nov. 16.  The Debt Management Office will publish tomorrow minutes of
its quarterly meeting with primary dealers and investors held
today. The debt office bases the issuance program on its
consultation with market participants to make sure it meets the
demands of the market.  U.K. government bonds returned 3 percent this year through
Dec. 7, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds gained 4.3 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
