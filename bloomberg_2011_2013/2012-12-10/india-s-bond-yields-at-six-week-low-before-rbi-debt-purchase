India ’s 10-year government bond
yields held at a six-week low before the central bank buys debt
for the second time this month to ease a cash squeeze.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will buy as much as 120 billion
rupees ($2.2 billion) of notes due in 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2026
tomorrow, according to a statement on its website. Lenders
borrowed 1.01 trillion rupees from the monetary authority’s
repurchase window on Dec. 7, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank lent an  average  of 928 billion
rupees a day in November, compared with 671 billion rupees the
previous month.  “The open-market buying is continuing to support bonds,”
said Srinivasa Raghavan, executive vice president of treasury at
 Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK)   The yield on the 8.15 percent notes maturing in June 2022
was little changed at 8.17 percent in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. Today’s rate matched the yield
touched  on Dec. 6, which was the lowest since Oct. 29. There
was no trading in the benchmark 10-year note on Dec. 7 before a
coupon payment tomorrow.  The monetary authority, which last cut the repurchase rate
by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April, will review its policy
on Dec. 18.  “Investors will wait for further cues from next week’s
policy review,” Raghavan said.  In the first purchase since June, the RBI bought 116.43
billion rupees of securities on Dec. 4, taking the total buying
so far in the fiscal year that began April to 936.43 billion
rupees.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points to 7.67 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
