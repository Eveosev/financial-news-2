(Corrects carload capacity to gallons in fifth paragraph
of story published Dec. 10.)  U.S. Class I railroads will move
more than 200,000 carloads of oil in 2012, the  Association of
American Railroads  said.  That’s up from 66,000 carloads last year, the Washington-
based industry association said in a report.  Shipments by train are becoming more efficient as different
sized cars become available to ship various crude grades that
take up more or less space depending on their density. Most cars
have a maximum weight of 286,000 pounds.  For light crude, such as  North Dakota ’s Bakken grade, the
“ideal” car has a capacity of 30,000 to 32,000 gallons (714 to
762 barrels,) according to the report. For denser, heavier
crudes, a car carries about 25,000 gallons.  As new rail cars are built, the amount of oil the average
car can hold may climb to between 30,000 and 32,000 gallons,
according to AAR, up from an average 28,000 gallons in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
