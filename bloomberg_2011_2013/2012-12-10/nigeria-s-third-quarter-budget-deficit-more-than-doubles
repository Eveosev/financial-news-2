Nigeria’s budget deficit more than
doubled in the third quarter to 459.1 billion naira ($2.9
billion), the Central Bank of Nigeria said.  The budget deficit of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-largest
economy jumped from 211.8 billion naira in the previous three
months and 161.1 billion naira in the third quarter of 2011, the
Abuja-based bank said in a Dec. 7  report  on its website.  “The deficit was financed mainly from domestic sources,
particularly through the issuance of additional Federal
Government of Nigeria bonds,” the bank said.  The country increased its target for this year’s budget
deficit to 2.97 percent of economic output in February, from a
2.77 percent target announced in December 2011, after it added
733 billion naira of spending on gasoline subsidies, according
to the Finance Ministry. The country wants to narrow the fiscal
deficit to 2.2 percent of GDP next year, according to the Oct.
10 budget proposal by President Goodluck Jonathan.  During the period, 26.2 billion naira were withdrawn from
the excess crude account “to bridge the shortfall in revenue
for the period,” leaving $9.3 billion in the account, in which
Nigeria saves revenue from crude sales higher than the budgeted
price, the bank said. The government aims to raise savings in
the account to $10 billion to provide a buffer against global
economic uncertainty.  Net foreign-currency inflows through the bank in the
quarter stood at $5.8 billion, with inflows at $14.4 billion and
outflows at $9.2 billion, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
