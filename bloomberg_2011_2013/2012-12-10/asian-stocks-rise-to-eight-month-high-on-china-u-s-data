Asian  stocks  gained, with a regional
gauge excluding  Japan  heading for its highest close in more than
a year, after U.S. jobs data topped estimates and  China ’s
factory output and retail sales signaled a quickening economic
recovery.  Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd. (551) , a maker of shoes for
Nike Inc., gained 1.7 percent in Hong Kong. Rio Tinto Group, the
world’s second-largest mining company, rose 1.9 percent in
Sydney after Chinese industrial production beat estimates.
Advantest Corp., the largest producer of semiconductor-testing
devices, jumped 3.9 percent in  Tokyo  after saying orders will
rise. Hino Motors Ltd. slid 1.3 percent after recalling trucks
in the U.S. due to a battery flaw.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  gained 0.2
percent to 458.87 as of 7:41 p.m. Tokyo time, poised for its
highest close since Aug. 4, 2011. A gauge that includes Japan
was little changed, having erased gains of as much as 0.3
percent after a report showed China’s November exports increased
at a slower pace than analysts forecast. The index climbed in
the past three weeks amid signs of recovery in the world’s two
largest economies.  “We could see a more sustained recovery in equity markets
as  China’s economy  shows signs of gradual recovery,” said  Yoji Takeda , who oversees about $1.2 billion as Hong Kong-based head
of Asian equities at RBC Investment Management ( Asia ) Ltd.
“There’s underlying uncertainty in  Europe  amid political
maneuvering in  Italy  ahead of elections.”  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said he intends to
resign, renewing concern nations in the euro currency bloc are
grappling with a deepening debt crisis. This comes ahead of a
Dec. 13-14 summit of European Union leaders to debate a road map
for the overhaul of the 17-nation region.  China Output  China’s Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.1 percent. The
nation’s exports rose 2.9 percent in November from a year
earlier, compared with the 9 percent median estimate of 31
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and an 11.6 percent increase
in October. Industrial production climbed 10.1 percent in
November from a year earlier and retail sales growth accelerated
to 14.9 percent, while inflation was 2 percent, the statistics
bureau said yesterday.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index added 0.4 percent.  Singapore ’s
Straits Times Index gained 0.2 percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index rose 0.1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index was little
changed, erasing gains of as much as 0.7 percent.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 0.1 percent, erasing
gains of as much as 0.6 percent, while the broader Topix fell
0.2 percent. The nation’s gross domestic product shrank for a
second consecutive quarter in the three months through
September, putting the nation’s economy into a technical
recession and underscoring opposition calls ahead of an election
for stronger measures to stimulate demand.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.3
percent today. The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent last week, a third
week of gains and the gauge’s longest winning streak since
August, as U.S. employment growth topped forecasts and investors
weighed prospects for a budget agreement in  Washington .  President  Barack Obama  and House Speaker  John Boehner  met
yesterday at the White House to discuss the dispute over the
U.S. budget, representatives of both said. An agreement would
help avert the so-called fiscal cliff, which could result in
more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts taking
effect next month.  Exporters to the U.S. advanced. Yue Yuen, which gets about
29 percent of its sales from the U.S., rose 1.7 percent to
HK$26.40 in Hong Kong.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and
clothes to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., added 1.1
percent to HK$13.10 in Hong Kong. Billabong International Ltd.,
Australia’s biggest surfwear maker, increased 3.5 percent to 88
Australian cents.  Metal Demand  Raw-material producers posted the biggest advance among the
10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Copper
futures advanced for a second day on speculation demand from
China, the biggest user, will increase as industrial production
accelerated.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , which gets about 31 percent of sales from
China, climbed 1.9 percent to A$61.30 in Sydney. BHP Billiton
Ltd. the world’s largest mining company, added 0.6 percent to
A$34.95.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., Australia’s third-biggest
iron-ore producer, surged 6.9 percent to A$4.05. BC Iron Ltd.
agreed to raise its stake in an iron-ore joint venture with
Fortescue for A$190 million ($199 million) to help boost its
annual production by 80 percent.  Advantest, Sumco  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 16 percent through
Dec. 7 from this year’s low on June 4 as central banks from
Europe, the U.S., Japan and China took steps to support economic
growth. The gauge traded at 14.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the  S&P 500  Index and 12.6
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Advantest Corp. jumped 3.9 percent to 1,108 yen in Tokyo.
Orders will increase to about 30 billion yen ($363 million) this
quarter and reach 70.5 billion yen for the six months ending
March 31, or the lower end of the company’s forecast, President
Haruo Matsuno said in an interview, challenging a Credit Suisse
Group AG report that predicts a decline.  Sumco Corp. (3436) , a maker of semiconductor wafers, surged 17
percent to 680 yen. Bank of America Merrill Lynch maintained a
buy rating on the stock and raised its share-price forecast to
930 yen from 820 yen, saying wafer prices will increase.  Among stocks that fell, Hino Motors slid 1.3 percent to 700
yen. The company will recall about 35,200 trucks in the U.S.
because of a battery flaw that could spark a fire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
