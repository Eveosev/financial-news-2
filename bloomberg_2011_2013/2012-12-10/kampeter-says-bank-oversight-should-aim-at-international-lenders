German Deputy Finance Minister
Steffen Kampeter said  Europe ’s future banking supervisor should
regulate international banks and leave oversight for some
national lenders to national supervisors.  “We don’t want this to be a banking mishmash,” Kampeter
said in a speech at the German Finance Ministry in Berlin today.
“In those areas where structures have proved themselves, where
business has been solid and there’s no threat of any systemic
risk, national ownership, national liability should have
priority.”  Kampeter cited the “German model,” which combines
exchange-listed lenders such as Deutsche Bank AG, savings banks
and cooperative banks, as an example for regulation that should
leave some powers to national supervisors.  Talks over a European banking supervisor bogged down in a
gathering on Dec. 4 in Brussels over how much power to give the
 European Central Bank  amid attempts by  Germany , the biggest
European economy, to shield its small banks.  Finance ministers will meet again in Brussels to tackle
divisions over euro-area bank supervision on Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
