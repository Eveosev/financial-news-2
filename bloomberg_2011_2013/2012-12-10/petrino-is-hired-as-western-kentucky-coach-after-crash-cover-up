Bobby Petrino was hired as football
coach at Western  Kentucky  University eight months after being
fired from the job at the University of Arkansas following a
motorcycle crash that injured him and a 25-year-old female staff
member.  Petrino, 51, succeeds Willie Taggart, who left the
Hilltoppers last week to become coach at the University of South
Florida. Western Kentucky was 7-5 this season and is playing
Central Michigan in the Little Caesar’s Pizza Bowl in  Detroit  on
Dec. 26.  The hiring was announced in a statement on the
Hilltopppers’  website .  Petrino was fired by Arkansas in April after he was injured
in the accident and then covered up the fact that Jessica
Dorrell, a member of his staff, was a passenger.  He later acknowledged having an “inappropriate
relationship” with Dorrell and giving her about $20,000 worth
of gifts. Dorrell resigned from her job a week after the
accident.  Petrino had a 34-17 record in four seasons at  Arkansas ,
leading the Razorbacks to a Cotton Bowl win over Kansas State.
He joined the school in 2007 after leaving the National Football
League’s Atlanta Falcons 13 games into the season.  Arkansas hired John L. Smith to succeed Petrino and went
4-8, including 2-6 in the Southeastern Conference. Smith was
replaced last week by Bret Bielema, who led  Wisconsin  to three
consecutive Big Ten conference titles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
