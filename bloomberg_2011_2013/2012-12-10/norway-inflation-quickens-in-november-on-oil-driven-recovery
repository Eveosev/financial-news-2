Norwegian underlying inflation
slowed in February as the krone’s strength pushed down the cost
of imported consumer goods.  Annual  underlying inflation , which adjusts for taxes, fees
and energy prices, slowed to 1.1 percent from 1.2 percent in
January, Oslo-based Statistics Norway said today. Prices were
estimated to rise 1.1 percent, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists. Underlying consumer
prices rose 0.7 percent in the month.  Policy makers in Norway, western Europe’s largest oil
producer, have signaled they will raise rates as soon as this
week to cap household credit growth and surging house prices.
The central bank has kept rates unchanged since March last year
in part to keep an appreciation in the krone in check.  The currency reached a record on a trade weighted basis on
Feb. 13, closing at 84.30. It’s up from 3 percent from a low
last year. A strong krone has helped keep inflation below the
central bank’s 2.5 percent target since mid-2009.  Headline inflation was 1 percent in the year and consumer
prices rose 0.7 percent in the month.  Policy makers will announce their next rate decision on
March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
