Gasoline for immediate loading in
northwest  Europe  advanced as Brent crude rallied and BP Plc
purchased barge lots.  Hedge funds and other money-managers raised gasoil bullish
bets by about 2 percent last week to the most in one month, data
from the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London showed.  Light Products  Gasoline for loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub
traded from $938 to $944 a metric ton, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That
compares with trades from $921 to $938 on Dec. 7.  Gunvor Group Ltd. sold 4,000 tons of the 7,000 tons that
changed hands. The trades, which usually comprise 1,000 to 2,000
tons, are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make
finished fuel.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to Brent, was little changed
at $4.18 a barrel as of 11:12 a.m. local time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and products broker in London.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent shrank for a third day to $3.60
a barrel, PVM data showed. That’s the least since Nov. 1 and
compares with $4.19 in the previous session.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for December delivery rose $2.75, or 0.3 percent, to
$908.50 a ton on the ICE exchange as of 12:12 p.m. local time.
January futures were at $912.50. The front-month contract
expires on Dec. 12.  That puts the market in contango for 21 trading days, which
usually signals reduced prompt demand or rising supply of fuel
for immediate delivery. It’s the longest stretch since a run
that ended in August last year.  Gasoil’s crack  fell to $14.60 a barrel versus $15.03 at
4:30 p.m. in the previous session. Brent increased 0.8 percent
to $107.90 a barrel.  Money managers’ net-long bets on ICE gasoil increased to
57,683 positions in the week to Dec. 4 from 56,652 in the
previous period, according to the ICE data. That’s the most
since Nov. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
