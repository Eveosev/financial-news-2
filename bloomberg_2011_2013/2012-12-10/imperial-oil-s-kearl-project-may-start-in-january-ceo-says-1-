Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  said the start of
its Kearl heavy oil sands project in  Alberta  may be delayed
until January because of early winter weather.  “It’s fair to say they’ve had a very early winter in the
Fort McMurray area,” Chief Executive Officer Bruce March said
following a presentation at the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers’ Investor symposium in Toronto. “We’re
fighting through that as we speak, but it’s really slowed down a
lot of the commissioning, startup activities.”  Imperial spokesman Pius Rolheiser said July 11 in an e-mail
the company planned to begin production at the Kearl site at
110,000 barrels a day by the end of this year. Production will
be sold as blended bitumen and shipped via  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s
Woodland pipeline, he said at the time.  The site is about about 44 miles (71 kilometers) north of
Fort McMurray, Alberta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
