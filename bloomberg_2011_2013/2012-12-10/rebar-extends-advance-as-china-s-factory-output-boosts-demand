Steel reinforcement-bar futures
extended the biggest weekly climb in more than two years on
speculation that a reviving economy in  China  will boost demand
for the material used in housing and infrastructure.  Rebar for May delivery rose 0.6 percent to 3,679  yuan 
($590) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the
highest price at close since Nov. 1. Futures climbed 4.6 percent
last week, the most since the week ended Oct. 15, 2010.  Daily crude steel output of major steel companies in late-
November rose 0.5 percent to 1.64 million tons compared with the
daily output in mid-November, data by China Iron & Steel
Association show. Industrial  production  climbed 10.1 percent in
November from a year earlier and retail sales growth accelerated
to 14.9 percent, while inflation was 2 percent, the National
Bureau of Statistics said.  “It will be difficult for steelmakers to trim production
or lower prices given so much optimism in the economy,” Zhang
Xin, analyst at Yongan Futures (Shenyang) Co., said by phone
from Shenyang. “We have to watch if the property market sees
real recovery or if this is just a flash in the pan,” he said.  The spot  price  of rebar rose 0.1 percent to 3,553 yuan a
ton today, according to data from Beijing Antaike  Information
Development Co. (4709)  Spot iron ore advanced 2.2 percent to $121 a dry
ton at Tianjin port on Dec. 7, the highest in three weeks,
according to data from The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
