Achmea BV won an arbitration case
against Slovakia in which the Dutch insurer claimed the country
breached investment treaties when it forbade health insurers
from making a profit.  The arbiters on Dec. 7 awarded Achmea 22 million euros
($28.4 million) in compensation for damages incurred by its
Slovak subsidiary Union AS because of the profit ban, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. The Slovak Finance
Ministry is analyzing the verdict, which it considers
unenforceable, spokesman Marek Rockar said in an e-mailed
statement on Dec. 8. It can be appealed within three months, he
added.  The ban was introduced in 2007 by the administration of
 Robert Fico , who has accused private health insurers of
profiting from public funds, which instead should be fully spent
on treatment. As the  Constitutional Court  has since ruled that
the measure contradicts the constitution, Fico’s government is
pursuing a plan to expropriate private providers and return to a
single state-owned insurer.  Two-thirds of Slovakia’s 5.4 million citizens are insured
by the state-run General Health Insurance Company. Union has
400,000 clients while Dovera, controlled by the Czech-Slovak
private equity group Penta, has 1.4 million clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
