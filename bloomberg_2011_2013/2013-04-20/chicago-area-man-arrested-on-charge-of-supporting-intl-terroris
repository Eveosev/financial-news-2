A 18-year-old Chicago-area man was
arrested by the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  late yesterday
at Oâ€™Hare International Airport on a charge of supporting
terrorism overseas.  Abdella Ahmad Tounisi, of Aurora,  Illinois , was taken into
custody without incident as he was getting on a flight for
Istanbul, the FBI said in a statement.  The bureau said he appeared in U.S. District Court today
and was charged with one count of attempting to provide material
support to a foreign terrorist organization, which is a felony.  The statement said he was traveling to Syria to join a
jihadist militant group operating inside Syria.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
