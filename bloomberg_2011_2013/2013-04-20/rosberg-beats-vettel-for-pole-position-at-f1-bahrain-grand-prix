Nico Rosberg beat out world
champion Sebastian Vettel to take pole position for tomorrow’s
Bahrain Grand Prix.  Rosberg’s qualifying time of 1 minute 32.330 seconds was
0.25 seconds faster than Red Bull’s Vettel. It gave the Mercedes
team its second consecutive pole after Lewis Hamilton topped
qualifying for last week’s Chinese Grand Prix.  Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso, Hamilton, Red Bull’s Mark Webber
and Ferrari’s Felipe Massa rounded out the six-fastest
qualifiers. Hamilton was then given a five-place penalty for a
gearbox change and will start ninth, while Webber was dropped
three places for an incident with Jean-Eric Vergne last week in
 China .  Vettel leads Lotus’s Kimi Raikkonen by three points in the
standings after three of 19 races, with Alonso nine points off
the pace in third.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
