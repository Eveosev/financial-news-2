International  tax evasion  is likely
to be a bigger focus this year under Russia’s Group of 20
presidency, International Monetary Fund First Deputy Managing
Director  David Lipton  said.  “With the mounting economic and fiscal difficulties in the
countries, it’s more consequential if someone is evading
taxes,” Lipton told reporters yesterday in Washington. “Under
the Russian presidency, there will be greater attention to the
subject.”  Global finance ministers and central bankers of the G-20,
who met in Washington in the past three days, called for
coordinated efforts to thwart international tax evasion and
urged countries to adopt automatic exchanges of tax-relevant
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
