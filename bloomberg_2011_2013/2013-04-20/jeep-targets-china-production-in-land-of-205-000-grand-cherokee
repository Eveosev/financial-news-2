Chrysler Group LLC’s newly
redesigned Jeep Cherokee is the “obvious choice” to become the
first Jeep built in China in six years and could double the
brand’s sales there, according to  Mike Manley , head of the
sport-utility line.  Jeep, which became the first western auto brand built in
China in 1983, may resume Chinese production by the end of next
year at a plant in Changsha, Manley said today in an interview
at the Shanghai Auto Show. The Cherokee on display at this show
will go on sale in the country at the end of this year as an
imported vehicle, he said.  Chrysler, which is controlled by  Fiat SpA (F) , is eager to
expand its Jeep brand in China, where it is already profitable
and where sales more than doubled last year to 46,000 units.
Jeep has remained so popular in  China  it spawned a clothing line
sold at more than 200 retail stores. That outnumbers Jeep’s 160
auto dealers in China, which Manley said he plans to double in
two years.  “Jeep is a premium brand here,” Manley said, noting the
high-end Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 sells for $205,000 in China,
three times more than it fetches in the U.S. The new Cherokee
“could double our volume here.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
