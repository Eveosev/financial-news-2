The test launch of  Orbital Sciences
Corp. (ORB) ’s new rocket was called off again, this time due to wind.  The liftoff of the unmanned Antares rocket had been
scheduled for 5 p.m. today Washington time from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Wallops Flight Facility
on Virginia’s Eastern Shore.  It was pushed to 6:10 p.m. this afternoon and then called
off for the day because of upper-level winds, Dulles, Virginia-
based Orbital Sciences said in a Twitter posting.  “We will try again tomorrow,” the company wrote. The next
launch attempt will be no earlier than 5 p.m. tomorrow.  A launch attempt on April 17 was scrubbed about 12 minutes
before liftoff because a data cable prematurely disconnected
from the rocket.  The Antares test launch would be a key milestone in the
company’s plan to begin regular cargo deliveries to the
International Space Station as early as September.  The test launch involves delivering a simulated version of
the Cygnus unmanned supply ship to orbit. The replica won’t
connect with the station.  Orbital is following billionaire Elon Musk’s Space
Exploration Technologies Corp., which last May became the first
company to dock a commercial craft at the station.  Orbital has a $1.9 billion contract with  NASA  for eight
cargo resupply flights to the space station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
