Petroleos Mexicanos said it started
up its $530 million, 300 megawatt cogeneration power plant, part
of a plan to become self-sufficient in energy generation.  The Nuevo Pemex plant in the southeastern state of Tabasco,
financed by Spain’s  Abengoa SA (ABG)  and  Mexico ’s state bank Banobras,
will save the state oil company $152 million a year by replacing
less efficient generators, the company known as Pemex said in a
 statement  on its website.  The plant is the largest of its kind in Latin America,
Pemex said. Cogeneration produces electricity from heat sources
such as steam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
