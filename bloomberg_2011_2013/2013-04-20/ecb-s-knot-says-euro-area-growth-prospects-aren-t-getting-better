The economic situation in the 17-
nation euro area isn’t getting better and the  European Central
Bank  has little room left to maneuver, European Central Bank
Governing Council member Klaas Knot said.  “The last information we have on the economy isn’t that
positive and isn’t leading to better prospects,” Knot said,
speaking to reporters late yesterday in Washington where he is
attending a meeting of the International Monetary Fund. “We
have little ammunition left so we need to ask ourselves when is
the right moment to use it,” Knot said.  With doubts growing about the ECB’s projection for an
economic recovery later this year, ECB President  Mario Draghi 
has signaled he’s looking at a range of measures, including
cutting  interest rates . ECB Governing Council member Jens Weidmann, who also heads Germany’s Bundesbank, said yesterday
that the ECB would only lower borrowing costs to a record low if
economic data worsen. The benchmark rate is currently 0.75
percent.  Knot, who is also the Dutch Central Bank President, echoed
comments made by Draghi yesterday who said the euro area hasn’t
improved since the ECB’s last meeting on April 4. The Frankfurt-
based central bank has been closely watching data as they come
in, “and so far we haven’t seen any improvement in the
situation,” Draghi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
