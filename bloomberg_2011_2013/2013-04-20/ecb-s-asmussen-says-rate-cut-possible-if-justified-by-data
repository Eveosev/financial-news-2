The  European Central Bank  has
already “done quite a lot” to help the euro-area economy and
could cut interest rates further if data show a need for it,
Executive Board Member Joerg Asmussen said.  “The effectiveness of rate cuts is limited but it’s still
possible to do this if data justified it,” he said on a panel
in Washington today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
