Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said she supports policies
announced by the Slovenian government and dismissed investors’
concern that the country will be the next euro-area nation to
receive a bailout.  “I would not trust the rumors,” Lagarde said in a news
conference in  Washington  today. The country’s prime minister,
Alenka Bratusek, “has indicated she wants to pursue
privatization, that she wants to allow for better management of
companies” close to being bankrupt and to “reinforce the
capital of Slovenian banks.”  “These 3 principles are not bad principles from which to
start,” Lagarde said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
