BP Plc (BP/) , Europe’s second-largest oil
company, said it’s reviewing plans to develop the Mad Dog 2 oil
field in the Gulf of Mexico, citing market conditions and
industry inflation.  BP is studying the existing plans and other options as it
decides how to develop the project with co-owners  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BLT)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  unit Union Oil Company of  California ,
company spokeswoman Sheila Williams wrote in an e-mailed
statement. The company, based in London, said it’s too early to
say when the details of the final plan would be approved.  BP is facing the third anniversary of the 2010 oil spill in
the Gulf of Mexico at its Macondo site, the biggest offshore
spill in U.S. history. BP is the biggest oil producer in the
Gulf and its best producing assets there are Thunder Horse,
Atlantis and Mad Dog.  “The current development plan for Mad Dog Phase 2 is not
as attractive as previously modeled,” Williams said. “BP fully
intends to develop the resources at Mad Dog Phase 2 and is
committed to moving forward with the right plan.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
