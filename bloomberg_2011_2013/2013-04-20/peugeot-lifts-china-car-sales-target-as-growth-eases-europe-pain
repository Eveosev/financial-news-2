PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest carmaker, raised its sales target in China by 11
percent after demand rose more than expected in the first
quarter, providing welcome relief to woes in its home region.  The French carmaker plans to deliver 557,000 cars this
year, up from its previous target of 500,000 because of robust
demand for the Peugeot 3008 crossover and Citroen C4L sedan,
Gregoire Olivier, the head of the company’s Asian operations,
said in an interview today at the Shanghai Motor Show.  The new 2013 sales target would give Peugeot a market share
of about 4 percent in China. That would put the company on track
to reach its goal of grabbing 5 percent of car deliveries in the
world’s largest auto market by 2015 as it seeks to catch up with
competitors.  “I’m very confident that we will reach our target” in two
years, said Olivier. “We’re well in line with our plan” on
sales and profitability per car is rising as well.  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , the world’s second-
and third-biggest carmakers, are the top sellers in China, while
Paris-based Peugeot grasps for a foothold with market share in
the country at just 3.5 percent last year. Growth in China is
crucial to Peugeot’s efforts to revive profit as the European
car market slumps to a 20-year low.  Late Surge  Peugeot is “not as late as Fiat and Renault but still,
compared to GM and Volkswagen, they’re very late” in targeting
China, Sascha Gommel, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank
AG, said by phone. Based on Peugeot’s deliveries in the country
this year, “they’re actually quite strong, with very good
volume development in the first quarter.”  The French manufacturer’s deliveries in  China  soared 31
percent to 142,000 vehicles in the first three months of 2013,
the automaker said on April 19, estimating that it accounted for
3.95 percent of the market. VW and GM had respective shares of
16 percent and 8 percent in February, according to LMC
Automotive estimates.  “In markets such as this one, you need to have at least an
8 percent share to generate some cash,” said Florent Couvreur,
an analyst at CM-CIC Securities who recommends selling Peugeot
shares. Peugeot is growing “at about the same pace as
Volkswagen this year, and this is perhaps the only market in the
world where they’re growing faster than the market itself.”  Share Gainers  The manufacturer is displaying the Peugeot 301 budget model
and Citroen C-Elysee sedan at the Shanghai show, which concludes
April 29. Sales of the models in China are scheduled to start in
the second half of this year.  “The C-Elysee and 301 seem to me to be excellent products
to gain market share” in a competition with models such as
Volkswagen’s Jetta and  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Focus, Couvreur said.  Burdened by Europe’s slowdown, the French company reported
a loss before interest, taxes and one-time gains or costs of 576
million euros ($752 million) in 2012, its first deficit in three
years, versus earnings of 1.09 billion euros in 2011.  Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin laid out a strategy
in February for Peugeot to deliver 50 percent of its vehicles
outside Europe by 2015. Peugeot made 62 percent of its
deliveries and generated 68 percent of revenue in Europe last
year. Group sales in China rose 9.2 percent to 442,000 cars and
commercial vans, reaching 16 percent of the French company’s
global total, led by the Peugeot brand.  New Dealers  The state-backed China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers is forecasting that car sales this year will rise
8.5 percent to 16.8 million vehicles. To tap that growth,
Peugeot plans to add an average of 100 dealerships a year in the
country, split roughly equally between its two brands. Peugeot
currently has about 360 stores and Citroen around 410, Olivier
said.  Citroen’s upscale DS line will operate as a stand-alone
premium brand in China in a bid to benefit from growing demand
for luxury cars in the country, he said.  Olivier, a 52-year-old engineer who graduated at the top of
his class at  France ’s elite Polytechnique engineering school in
1979, has been a member of Peugeot’s  management  board since
2007. A former executive at plane-engine and mobile-phone
producer  Safran SA (SAF)  and former CEO of Peugeot’s 57 percent-owned
Faurecia car-parts operation, Olivier has led the automaker’s
Asian operations since 2010.  Big Bet  Peugeot currently builds cars at two plants in Hubei,
China, in a joint venture set up in in 1992 with Dongfeng Motor
Co., the country’s biggest automaker. A third plant in that city
is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, allowing
the partnership to increase capacity to 750,000 by 2015 from
450,000 in 2010.  The French company signed a second venture agreement in
2011 with Changan Automobile Group Co., with the aim to produce
200,000 vehicles a year at the Chinese partner’s plant in
Shenzhen. The venture, called CAPSA, will start building the DS5
premium compact car in the second half of 2013.  Peugeot investment in Chinese activities since 2010 total
about 19.4 billion  yuan  ($3.14 billion), spokesman Jean-Baptiste Mounier said.  “They bet a lot on China, and that’s understandable,” CIC
analyst Couvreur said. “The only issue is that the dividends
they’ve got so far from their operations are less than 100
million euros, which hardly helps.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
