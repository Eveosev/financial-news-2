Support for a vote on Scottish
independence from the U.K. may be determined by the state of its
economy, the Financial Times reported.  While less than a third of Scots are committed to
supporting independence, many are still undecided and their
decision may be swayed by the performance of the economy, the
newspaper said.  Should the economy perform badly before the referendum it
would reduce support for separating from the U.K., the FT said.  Scotland  is due to hold a referendum on independence in the
fall of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
