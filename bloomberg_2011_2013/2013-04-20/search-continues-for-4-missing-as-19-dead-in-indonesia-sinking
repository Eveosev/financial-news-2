Rescue workers in  Indonesia ’s East
Kalimantan province continued searching for four people missing
after a boat capsized in a river on April 17, as the death toll
rose to 19.  Twenty-one of the 44 people aboard the boat have been
rescued, Wahyu Widhi Heranata, head of the province’s disaster
management agency office in Samarinda, said by telephone from
Jakarta today. Bodies were found as far away as 15 kilometers (9
miles) from the site of the accident, he said.  “The river’s strong current makes the search difficult and
for divers visibility underwater is practically zero,” Heranata
said. “We try to extend our search to the Sanga Sanga district
which is about 20 kilometers away.”  The boat capsized after leaking as it ferried mostly female
workers of plywood producer PT Kalamur across the Mahakam river,
Heranata said.  Indonesia has experienced numerous maritime accidents as
ferries are widely used in the world’s biggest archipelago, and
as asylum seekers sometimes brave rough seas in ill-equipped
boats bound for  Australia . In September at least eight people
died when a ferry collided with an oil tanker in the Sunda
Strait. At least 100 people died in 2011 when a boat carrying
130 sank near Maluku island east of Java.  To contact the reporter on this story:
