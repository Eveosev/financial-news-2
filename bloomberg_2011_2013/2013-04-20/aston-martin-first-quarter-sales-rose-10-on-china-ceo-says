Aston Martin, the British maker of
 sports cars  featured in  James Bond movies , posted a 10 percent
increase in global sales last quarter, driven by demand from
 China , Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Bez said.  Sales in China climbed 36 percent last quarter and the
company expects deliveries to increase 40 percent for the year,
Bez said in an interview at the Shanghai Auto Show today.
Globally, sales will probably rise slightly this year, he said.  China, already the world’s biggest auto market, is becoming
even more important for carmakers as European auto demand heads
toward its lowest level in 20 years. In the luxury space, China
will surpass the U.S. by as early as 2016 and equal that of
Western  Europe  by 2020, according to estimates at McKinsey & Co.  China will probably account for as much as 25 percent of
the company’s sales in the next three-to-five years, he said.
 Aston Martin  will increase its number of dealership in China to
more than 20 in two or three years from 14 now, he said.  Bez said he anticipates much uncertainty in Europe, for
Germany to experience a general slowdown, while demand in
southern Europe struggles to recover.  The company plans to introduce two new cars every year,
including a convertible, though it hasn’t “found the right
slot” for an SUV, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
