Federal charges against a suspect
in the  Boston  Marathon bombing that killed three and injured
more than 170 will be filed “in the coming days,” the U.S.
Attorney’s office in Boston said.  Christina Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, announced her office’s plans to begin the prosecution
just hours after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was taken into custody
following a manhunt through the suburbs of Boston. Police
captured Tsarnaev, who has yet to be charged, at a house in
Watertown, where he was hiding after an almost 24-hour chase
that shut down Boston and surrounding cities.  The suspect and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was
killed in the confrontation with police the day before, were
pursued as part of a sprawling four-day investigation following
the April 15 attack. One police officer was killed and another
injured in exchanges of gunfire during the manhunt.  The brothers are suspected of planting two bombs that
exploded about 10 seconds apart near the finish line of the
marathon.  After Tsarnaev was captured, Ortiz said the investigation
into the attack is “active and ongoing” and that authorities
will evaluate a “tremendous amount of evidence.”  “My journey and my office’s journey begins, and this
investigation will continue,” she said at a press conference.  The suspect, who police said was seriously injured, is a
patient at Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston, said
Kelly Lawman, a spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
