Portugal faces a difficult economic
outlook and may get more time to meet its targets, Dutch Finance
Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters in Washington today.  “Portugal is also facing a very, very tough economic
situation, so we have to take that into account, if necessary
allow more time also in the Portuguese case, as has been done in
other countries,’’ said Dijsselbloem, who chairs the group of
euro-area finance ministers.  Dijsselbloem said Portugal has ‘‘great commitment’’ to the
terms of its bailout program and that EU authorities are looking
forward to new proposals from the  Portuguese government .  To contact the reporter on this story:
