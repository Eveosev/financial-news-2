The  International Monetary Fund 
said it will use revamped tools to assess countries’ debt
sustainability and strengthen its method to set debt limits in
its loan programs.  The commitment is part of a checklist prepared by the
lender for finance chiefs from its 188 member nations meeting in
Washington today, in an effort to give the global recovery more
traction. The document also says “many countries” need to
spell out how they will reduce debt in the medium term.  “Lingering concerns over the future trajectory of public
and private debt highlight the importance of durable fiscal
adjustment and institutional reform,” IMF Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  wrote in the 13-page Global Policy Agenda
released today. “Even if stable, large deficits and high public
and private debt reduce potential growth and leave economies
vulnerable to shocks.”  Debt sustainability has been a key IMF requirement in
recent loan negotiations in the euro region, becoming a sticking
point with European creditors in the case of Greece and Cyprus.
The fund said in the report it would also apply lessons from
previous episodes of unsustainable debt when helping countries
detect risks to fiscal sustainability.  “In its advice and analysis, the fund will seek the right
balance between supporting growth -- including through monetary
easing -- and removing the millstone of high private and public
debt,” according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
