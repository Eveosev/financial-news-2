The European Union may need to
enact treaty changes to create a new institution to shut down
failing banks, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said.  The EU can pursue most of its banking-union strategy under
existing treaties, Dijsselbloem, who chairs the so-called
Eurogroup of euro-area finance ministers, told reporters in
Washington today.  “I know that we can push forward at least 80, 90 percent
of the project, and the final decision on having a singular
resolution authority may need to make a treaty change,”
Dijsselbloem said.  The  European Central Bank  and  Michel Barnier , the EU’s
financial services chief, have called for a European Resolution
Authority to intervene at crisis-hit banks, saying the step is
essential to untangle the fates of lenders and sovereigns.
Barnier said he will present draft legislation in June.  Dijsselbloem said there’s a difference of opinion on the
single resolution authority, with Germany calling for treaty
change and the European Commission saying they already have a
legal basis to proceed.  ‘‘I think the banking union at the moment is the most
important project for Europe and the  euro zone  in particular,”
Dijsselbloem said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
