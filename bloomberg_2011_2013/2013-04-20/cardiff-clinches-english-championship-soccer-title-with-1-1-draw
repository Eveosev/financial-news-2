Cardiff City clinched the title in
English soccer’s Championship with a 1-1 draw against Burnley.  Cardiff secured promotion to the Premier League from the
second tier earlier this week and needed just a draw to claim
the title. Craig Conway put Cardiff in front in the first half
before Burnley’s David Edgar scored in second-half stoppage
time.  The top two teams in the Championship earn automatic
promotion to the Premier League, with the third through sixth
place teams entering a playoff for another spot.  Watford beat Blackburn 4-0 to pull within four points of
second place Hull, which drew 0-0 last night with Bristol City,
with two games left. Brighton is fourth with 69 points, five
fewer than Hull, followed by Crystal Palace (67) and Bolton (66)
in the playoff places.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
