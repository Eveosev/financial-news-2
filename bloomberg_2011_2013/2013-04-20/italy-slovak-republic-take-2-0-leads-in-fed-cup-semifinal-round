2-0 leads after the opening day of the Fed Cup tennis
semifinals.  Sara Errani defeated Lucia Safarova 6-4, 6-2, and Roberta
Vinci beat Petra Kvitova 6-4, 6-1 to put Italy in front in the
best-of-five matchup in Palermo. The defending champion Czechs
must win tomorrow’s doubles match and both reverse singles to
avoid elimination.  Dominika Cibulkova beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 5-7, 6-1,
6-4, and Daniela Hantuchova beat  Maria Kirilenko  6-2, 6-4 to
