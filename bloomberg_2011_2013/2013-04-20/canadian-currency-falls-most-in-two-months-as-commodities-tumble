Canada’s dollar weakened the most
in almost two months against its U.S. counterpart as falling
commodities and slower inflation stoked bets the world’s 11th-
largest economy is faltering.  The currency fell the most since 2011 on April 15 as
commodities slid, led by gold, which had its biggest drop since
1983. The  Bank of Canada  kept its key  interest rate  at 1 percent
while cutting its full-year growth forecast to 1.5 percent,
saying economic slack will persist for two years. The  inflation 
rate slowed to 1 percent, the bottom of the central bank’s
target range. A report next week may show retail sales slowed.  “People are starting to revisit the big commodity theme,
and if you start to think the commodity theme is over, it’s
really bad news for the Canadian dollar,” said Clement Gignac,
chief economist at Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial
Services Inc., by telephone from  Quebec City . “It’s a
significant signal.”  The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 1.3 percent this week
in Toronto to C$1.0266 per  U.S. dollar . It was the biggest
weekly drop since Feb. 22. One Canadian dollar purchases 97.41
U.S. cents.  The loonie sank 1.2 percent to C$1.0256 to the greenback on
April 15 in its biggest one-day drop since Dec. 8, 2011.  Currency Bets  Futures traders increased to the highest level in more than
six years their  bets  that the Canadian dollar will weaken
against the U.S. currency, figures from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the Canadian dollar
compared with those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was
75,913 on April 16, the most since February 2007. The figure was
71,133 on April 12.  Canada ’s 10-year government bonds rose for a third week,
the longest stretch since November, pushing  yields  down three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.71 percent. Yields
touched 1.69 percent on April 17, the lowest since December. The
price of the 1.5 percent security maturing in June 2023 gained
25 cents to C$98.07.  The Bank of Canada will auction C$3.3 billion ($3.2
billion) of 1.5 percent notes on April 24. The securities mature
in August 2015.  Commodities Drop  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell 2.5
percent in its third weekly loss, reaching a nine-month low of
596.36 on April 18. Futures on crude oil, Canada’s largest
export, declined 0.8 percent to $88.01 per barrel in  New York 
and touched $85.61, the lowest level this year.  Raw materials  including oil account for about half of
Canada’s export revenue.  “We saw general decline in commodities across the board,
particularly metals, earlier in the week,” Aaron Fennell, a
futures specialist at Scotiabank’s ScotiaMcleod unit, said by
phone from Toronto. “The biggest story was the gold decline,
which sort of pushes the U.S. dollar higher, and the Canadian
dollar would probably slide a little bit with gold. But we also
saw declines in copper and aluminum and nickel and all the base
metals we like to mine in Canada.”  Gold for immediate delivery slid 9.1 percent on April 15,
the biggest daily drop since 1983, to $1,348.21 an ounce before
ending the week at $1,403.79. It traded on April 1 at $1,599.52.  Copper futures lost 6 percent on the week, while nickel
declined 4.3 percent. Aluminum fell 1.3 percent yesterday.
Miners and energy explorers that account for  8 percent  of the
Canadian economy lost more than $21 billion of their value this
week as stocks tumbled.  Export Obstacle  The central bank in its monetary policy report  singled out 
the strong Canadian dollar as an obstacle for Canadian
exporters. The strength was caused in part by the  currency
devaluation  in other countries amid monetary stimulus, it said.  Global finance chiefs handed  Japan  leeway yesterday to
reflate its stagnant economy by indicating its fresh round of
monetary stimulus doesn’t contravene an agreement to avoid a
currency war.  Meeting for the first time since the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
unleashed new measures aimed at delivering 2 percent  inflation 
within two years, Group of 20 finance ministers and central
bankers said in  Washington  those actions are “intended to stop
deflation and support domestic demand.” They echoed their
promise of February that nations will refrain from “competitive
devaluation” and avoid “persistent exchange-rate
misalignments.”  The BOJ said April 4 it plans to purchase 7.5 trillion yen
($76 billion) of bonds a month in its effort to turn around 15
years of deflation.  ‘Artificial Support’  “The Japanese are fundamentally devaluing their currency,
and it’s part of the fundamental strategy, and to a lesser
extent there’s somewhat of a race to the bottom,” said Mark Frey, chief market strategist at Cambridge Mercantile Group, a
foreign-exchange and payments provider, by phone from Victoria,
British Columbia. “It provides artificial support for the
Canadian dollar at a time when the domestic economic situation
is turning weaker.”  Retail sales in Canada slowed to 0.3 percent in February
from 1 percent the previous month, which was the highest since
September 2011, economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast before
 Statistics Canada  reports the data on April 23.  The Canadian currency fell 0.2 percent over the past month
against nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg’s
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen slid 5 percent,
 Australia ’s dollar lost 1.2 percent and the U.S. dollar declined
0.2 percent. The euro gained 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
