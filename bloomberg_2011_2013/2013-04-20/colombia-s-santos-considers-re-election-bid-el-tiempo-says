Colombia ’s President  Juan Manuel Santos  said he may run for re-election next year, daily El
Tiempo reported.  Santos, who was elected in 2010, said that if re-elected,
he would only serve for two years in a bid to extend
presidential terms to six years from the current four-year
mandate, the Bogota-based newspaper said in its  online  edition.  The government will request that Congress pass legislation
establishing six-year mandates for all elected authorities, El
Tiempo cited Santos as saying yesterday at an annual mayors
meeting in the coastal city of Cartagena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
