Italy’s parliament failed to select a president in
the fifth ballot as the country’s main parties made a last-minute appeal to
Giorgio Napolitano to accept another term.  More than 440 blank ballots were cast as of 1:06 p.m. in  Rome , with the
leading vote-getter Stefano Rodota -- the candidate of Beppe Grillo’s 5 Star
Movement -- at 210, according to TV network SKY TG24. A candidate needs 504
votes to be elected.  Today’s vote comes after Italian Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani
failed to build support for ex-Premier and former European Commission President
 Romano Prodi , who fell short of a simple majority in the fourth ballot. Bersani
announced late yesterday he will resign as PD leader after a new president is
elected.  The new president of the republic, who will replace Napolitano and serve a
seven- year term, will play a key role in ending the political impasse caused by
inconclusive elections in February that led to a hung parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
