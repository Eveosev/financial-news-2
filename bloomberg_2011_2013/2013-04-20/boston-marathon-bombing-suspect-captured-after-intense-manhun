The hunt for the second suspect in
the  Boston  Marathon bombing ended tonight when he was captured
after being surrounded in the backyard of a home in Watertown,
 Massachusetts .  Dzhokar Tsarnaev, 19, was taken into custody following an
around-the-clock manhunt just days after the attack that
transformed Americaâ€™s most storied road-race into a tableau of
mayhem and confusion.  Tsarnaev had escaped a confrontation with police last night
that killed his older brother Tamerlan. He was cornered as he
hid a boat stowed in the yard of a Watertown home.  The two brothers were suspected of planting two bombs that
exploded about 10 seconds apart near the finish line of the
Boston Marathon on April 15.  The blasts ripped through spectators, killing an 8-year-old
boy, a 29-year-old woman and a Chinese graduate student at
 Boston University . Many of the more than 170 people injured lost
their limbs, leaving sidewalks on a commercial stretch of
downtown Boston stained with blood.  The brothers were the two men seen in videos and pictures
released yesterday by the FBI showing one in a black cap and
another in a white cap on the sidewalk along the marathon route.
Dzhokar Tsarnaev was the suspect in the white hat, Massachusetts
State Police Colonel Timothy Alben said at an earlier briefing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
