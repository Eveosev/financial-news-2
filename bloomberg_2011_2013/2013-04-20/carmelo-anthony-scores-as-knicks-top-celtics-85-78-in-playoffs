Carmelo Anthony scored 36 points to
help the New York Knicks rally to an 85-78 win over the  Boston 
Celtics and take a 1-0 lead in their National Basketball
Association best-of-seven playoff series.  In the second Eastern Conference game today, the Brooklyn
Nets host the Chicago Bulls.  The Knicks were down 70-63, with one minute, 20 seconds
left in the third quarter after Paul Pierce’s 3-pointer at
Madison Square Garden. New York then scored 18 points and held
Boston to eight in the fourth quarter.  “We stayed with it,” Anthony said in a televised
interview. “We knew we were making minor mistakes. We corrected
them.”  J.R. Smith had 15 points and Raymond Felton added 13 for
the Knicks.  Jeff Green led the Celtics with 26 points, followed by
Pierce with 21 and Avery Bradley with 15.  Game 2 is April 23 in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
