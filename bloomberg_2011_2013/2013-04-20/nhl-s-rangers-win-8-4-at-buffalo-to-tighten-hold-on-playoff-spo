The  New York Rangers  scored three
goals in the final 78 seconds of the first period and went on to
an 8-4  National Hockey League  win at the Buffalo Sabres that
tightened their grip on a playoff spot.  The win gave the Rangers 50 points, two ahead of the
Winnipeg Jets for the eighth and final playoff spot in the NHL’s
Eastern Conference. Each team has four regular-season games
remaining.  The Jets today host the  New York Islanders , who are in
seventh place in the Eastern Conference with 51 points. The
Rangers next play tomorrow at home against the New Jersey
Devils.  Carl Hagelin opened the scoring for the Rangers with 78
seconds remaining in the first period last night.  Brad Richards 
and Ryane Clowe then added goals 17 seconds apart in the final
minute of the period at the First Niagara Center in Buffalo, New
York.  The Rangers made it 5-0 early in the second period when
Anton Stralman and Richards scored in a 27-second span. The five
goals came in 2 minutes, 58 seconds of playing time that
extended from the first period to the second. That set a Rangers
franchise record, breaking the old mark of five goals in 3:22
set in 1985, the team said in its game notes.  Richards scored a third goal in the final period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
