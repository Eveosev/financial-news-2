Matt Harvey allowed one run on four
hits in seven innings to lead the New York Mets to a 7-1 home
win against  Stephen Strasburg  and the Washington Nationals.  Harvey, 24, struck out seven last night and improved his
record to 4-0 this season. He has an earned run average of 0.93.  Strasburg, 24, gave up four runs in six innings at New
York’s Citi Field and fell to 1-3 this season for the Nationals.  Strasburg was the first pick in the 2009 Major League
Baseball draft. Harvey was the seventh pick in the 2010 draft.  In Toronto,  Andy Pettitte  improved to 3-0 in the New York
Yankees’ 9-4 victory against the Blue Jays. Pettitte, 40,
allowed three runs on six hits in 7 1/3 innings as the Yankees
won for the eighth time in their last 10 games.  Travis Hafner,  Vernon Wells  and Lyle Overbay all hit home
runs for the Yankees, who pulled within two games of the Boston
Red Sox in the American League East. Boston’s home game against
the  Kansas City Royals  was postponed as police conducted a
manhunt for the second suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
