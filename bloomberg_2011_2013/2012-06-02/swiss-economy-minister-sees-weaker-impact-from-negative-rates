The introduction of negative  interest
rates  in Switzerland would have an “even weaker” impact now
than the move did during the 1970s,  Le Temps  reported, citing
Swiss Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann.  The financial flows that could be controlled with such a
step would be “not very important,” Schneider-Ammann said in
an interview in today’s newspaper.  Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan said May 27 a
panel of government officials is considering measures such as
 capital controls  to weaken the Swiss franc should the euro
crisis escalate. Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said
in December a  task force  is examining options such as capital
controls and negative interest rates to curb the franc’s
strength.  The government will soon present a new package of growth
policies for 2012-2015, Schneider-Ammann said, according to Le
Temps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
