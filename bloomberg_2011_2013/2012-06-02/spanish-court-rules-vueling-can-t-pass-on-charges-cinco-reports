A court in Barcelona ruled that
 Vueling Airlines SA (VLG) , the Spanish low-cost carrier, can’t pass on
higher landing charges to clients who bought their tickets
before the price hike was announced,  Cinco Dias  reported.  The court said Vueling can’t enforce a clause in their
sales contract which allows them to charge clients extra after
the government increased fees by 19 percent at Spanish airports,
the newspaper said.  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , which last month told customers they
faced extra charges, may also be affected by the ruling, the
newspaper said.  Vueling plans to appeal the decision, Cinco Dias said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
