The management board of  Azoty Tarnow (ATT) ,
Poland’s biggest publicly traded chemicals producer, is
“strongly” against an offer from OAO Acron of  Russia .  The offer doesn’t reflect the fair value of the Polish
company and doesn’t take into account its long-term strategy,
Azoty said in a statement yesterday. The Russian fertilizer
maker bid for a 66 percent stake in Azoty at 36 zloty a share on
May 16.  Azoty closed yesterday’s trading in Warsaw at 38 zloty,
valuing the company at 2.44 billion zloty ($688 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
