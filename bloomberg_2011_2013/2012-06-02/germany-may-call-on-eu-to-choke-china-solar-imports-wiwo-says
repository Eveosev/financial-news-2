Germany  may call on the European
Union to apply high import tariffs on Chinese solar panels that
are sold at less than production costs, Environment Minister
Peter Altmaier told the  WirtschaftsWoche  busniess magazine.  Germany is trying to slow down the expansion of solar
energy to cut power prices, yet the countryâ€™s solar-panel makers
face unfair competition from subsidized Chinese manufacturers,
Altmaier told the weekly magazine. The U.S. in May raised  import
duties  on Chinese-made panels for the same reason, WiWo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
