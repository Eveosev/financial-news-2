Argentina ’s government plans to force
currency exchange houses to start quoting the U.S. dollar at
between 5 and 5.1 pesos instead of 5.9 pesos in the unofficial
parallel market, Senator Anibal Fernandez told Radio Mitre
today.  An illegal market in foreign currency has flourished since
November, when President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  ordered
that all currency transactions require tax agency approval. The
government met yesterday with the main foreign-exchange houses
and they will offer the dollar at 5.1 pesos per dollar on
June 4, Fernandez said. He didn’t elaborate on how the
government would enforce this.  Separately, La Nacion reported today that banks in
Argentina are asking clients to join waiting lists to withdraw
dollars from their own dollar-denominated bank accounts. The
newspaper didn’t cite its sources on the story.  To contact the reporters on this story:
