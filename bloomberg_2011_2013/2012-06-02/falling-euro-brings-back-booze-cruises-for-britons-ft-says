The British tradition of “booze
cruise” day trips to continental  Europe  to buy cheap beer and
wine is being revived, boosted by an exchange rate that’s seen
the pound strengthen to 1.25 euros for the first time in 3 ½
years, the Financial Times reported.  P&O Ferries Ltd. said it expects 140,000 passengers over
the four-day bank holiday weekend starting from today through
June 5, the FT said. With Queen Elizabeth II celebrating her
Diamond Jubilee and London hosting the Olympic Games this year,
many Groupe Eurotunnel SA customers are going to France to stock
up on beer and wine, the newspaper said, citing Fabienne Lissak,
a spokeswoman for the operator of the rail tunnels under the
English Channel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
