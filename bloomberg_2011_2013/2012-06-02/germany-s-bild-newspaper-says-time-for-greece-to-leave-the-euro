Greece  is reaching the endgame next
week,  Germany ’s best-selling Bild newspaper said.  Greeks are plundering their bank accounts, imports to the
country are not longer guaranteed, rumors abound of drachma
being printed and energy suppliers are no longer paid, Nikolaus
Blome, Bild’s chief political columnist, said in an editorial in
today’s edition.  “Greece is unraveling, it’s coming apart,” Blome said.
“Irrespective of how the upcoming parliamentary elections turn
out, ‘business as usual’ won’t work any more.”  Billions of euros in more aid from  Europe  can help Greece
through the next day, week or month, but it can’t bring about
the far more important new beginning that’s needed in the
economy, politics and administration. The Greek state “must be
rebuilt, like in a developing nation,” he said.  “Someone among the euro-zone leaders must finally tell the
Greeks the truth: this fresh start can only be achieved with a
radical first step,” he said. “And that means leaving the
euro.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
