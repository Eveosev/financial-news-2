Baggage handlers at  London ’s Stansted
Airport went on strike today for the third time in less than two
weeks over changes to working shifts.  About 80 out of 450 workers with Swissport International
Ltd. began a four-day strike at 5:30 a.m. local time, following
earlier two-day and one-day walkouts, a spokesman for Stansted
said today by phone. Contingency plans mean there has been no
impact on operations, he said.  Workers with the Unite union voted for the three strikes
over changes made by Swissport to scheduling of their work
shifts and holidays, according to a May 23 statement on the
union’s website. Swissport handles luggage at Stansted for
 Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , Atlasjet Havacilik AS,  TUI AG (TUI1) ’s Thomson,
Thomas Cook Group Plc and Belleair.  To contact the reporter on this story:
