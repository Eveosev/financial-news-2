 Polish Central Bank Governor Marek Belka said  Poland  won’t adopt the euro as long as the 17-
national currency fails to get a grip of the crisis, the Puls
Biznesu website reported, citing an interview.  In Poland, the danger of turbulence in public finances has
been “postponed,” Belka was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
