Kevin Garnett had 24 points and 11
rebounds for the Boston Celtics, who defeated the visiting Miami
Heat 101-91 in Game 3 of the National Basketball Association’s
Eastern Conference finals.  Miami leads the best-of-seven series two games to one. The
winner will face the  San Antonio Spurs  or the Oklahoma City
Thunder in the NBA Finals.  The Heat won Game 2 in Miami in overtime.  “We felt like we let the last one get away,”  Paul Pierce ,
who added 23 points for Boston, said in a televised interview.
“We just had to clean up some minor things. We have to go out
there and focus.”  Rajon Rondo had 21 points and 10 assists for Boston, which
had a 55-42 halftime advantage last night at TD Garden in
Boston.  Marquis Daniels, who had nine points for the Celtics,
“gave us a real lift tonight. He hasn’t really played in these
games but that’s what professionals do, they’re ready,” Pierce
said.  LeBron James  scored 34 points and  Dwyane Wade  added 18 for
the Heat. Game 4 is tomorrow in Boston.  San Antonio leads the Western Conference finals two games
to one, with Game 4 set for tonight in Oklahoma City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
