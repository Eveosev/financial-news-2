Manchester City will make a move for
Robin  van Persie  if the striker fails to agree on a new contract
at Arsenal, the  Daily Mail  said.  Van Persieâ€™s current deal expires after next season and
Arsenal is trying to sign him to an extension. The Dutchman led
the Premier League with 30 goals last seeason.  A offer of about 25 million pounds ($38 million) may be
required to sign van Persie and City manager Roberto Mancini
believes that is more realistic than the 45-million pound price
tag Napoli have put on striker Edinson Cavani, another target of
the Premier League champion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
