Oak Hill  Capital Partners LP, GI
Partners LLC and members of WaveDivision Holdings LLC’s
management agreed to buy the closely held cable-television
provider for an undisclosed price.  WaveDivision supplies cable, Internet and phone access to
more than 325,000 residential and business customers in
 Washington , Oregon and California, according to its website.  Earlier this year, the company was said to be exploring a
sale that might value it at $1 billion. The most likely bidders
for the Kirkland, Washington-based company were private-equity
firms, an unidentified person familiar with the matter told
Bloomberg News.  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter,
the companies said in a statement yesterday.  Dow Lohnes PLLC is WaveDivision’s legal counsel, while
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is providing legal
advice to Oak Hill and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is GI Partners’
legal counsel.  Royal Bank of Canada  and Waller Capital Corp., a  New York- 
based investment bank, advised WaveDivision on the transaction,
while Deutsche Bank AG and  Wells Fargo & Co . advised Oak Hill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
