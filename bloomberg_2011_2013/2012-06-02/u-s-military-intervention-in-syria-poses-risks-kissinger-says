Using U.S. military force to help
overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad may threaten
democratic and humanitarian goals, former Secretary of State
 Henry Kissinger  said in an opinion piece in the Washington Post.  Before deciding to send forces, the U.S. should consider
whether there’s a consensus on who should govern after the
overthrow, said Kissinger, who served under Presidents Richard
Nixon and Gerald Ford. Otherwise the U.S. risks getting caught
in a conflict “taking on an increasingly sectarian character,”
he said.  “In reacting to one human tragedy, we must be careful not
to facilitate another,” Kissinger wrote.  The massacre in Syria’s Houla of 108 people, 49 of them
children under the age of 10, last week prompted the ejection of
top Syrian diplomats from Western capitals. Russia is blocking
attempts in the  United Nations Security Council  to impose more
economic pressure on  Syria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
