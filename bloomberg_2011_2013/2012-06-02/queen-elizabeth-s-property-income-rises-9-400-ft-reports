Queen Elizabeth II’s property rental
income has surged 9,200 percent during her 60-year reign,
increasing at three times the inflation rate over the period,
the Financial Times reported, citing figures from the  Crown
Estate , the company that owns the monarch’s land and buildings.  The Crown Estate posted rental income of 230 million pounds
($356 million) for the year through March 2011, compared with
revenue of 2.5 million pounds in 1952, the newspaper said.  The property portfolio includes London’s Regent Street and
the U.K. seabed as far as 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the
shore. It doesn’t include Windsor Castle or  Buckingham Palace ,
which are owned by the Queen herself rather than the monarchy,
the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
