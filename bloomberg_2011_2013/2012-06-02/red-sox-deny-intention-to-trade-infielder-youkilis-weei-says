Boston Red Sox General Manager  Ben Cherington  denied a report that the team is shopping around
 Kevin Youkilis , WEEI sports radio reported.  “That’s inaccurate,” Cherington said in an e-mail to the
station. “Some teams have checked in on him. We haven’t told
any teams we plan to trade him.”  CBSSports.com reported yesterday, without citing the source
of its information, that Red Sox officials have told opponents
that they would like to trade for a pitcher.  Youkilis, 33, has been in 27 games this season while
rotating playing time with Adrian Gonzalez and Will
Middlebrooks. He has a .250 batting average with four home runs
and 12 runs batted in. Youkilis won World Series titles with
Boston in 2004 and 2007 and has spent his entire nine-year major
league career with the team.  Boston  is in last place in the American League East with a
27-25 record, three games behind division leader Tampa Bay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
