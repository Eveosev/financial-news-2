The Societe Nationale de Bois du
Gabon, a timber company controlled by the Gabonese government,
posted an increase in profit last year, Chief Executive Officer
Edmond Okemvele said in an interview.  Net income rose to 9.7 billion central African francs
($18.3 billion) in 2011 from 6.7 billion francs in 2010,
Okemvele said. The company is 51 percent owned by Gabon and the
rest is held by loggers, mostly French expatriates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
