The European Union cannot in the
short term set up a trade bloc-wide bank regulator, a central
rescue fund for lenders and a central system of guarantees for
deposits, Bundesbank Vice President Sabine Lautenschlaeger told
the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung .  Such instruments, called collectively a “Banking Union”
by their proponents, can only be set up “at the end of a long
path,” Lautenschlaeger is cited as saying in an interview. The
EU lacks a uniform set of administrative laws to create a single
bank oversight body, she said.  Creating a supra-national rescue fund for banks with cross-
border business and a central pool for guaranteeing deposits
“may imply that risks are shared” in the trade bloc, she said.
“In my opinion, that can only be a success in a fiscal union
with central controls and intervention rights.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
