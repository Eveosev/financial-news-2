Land Securities Group Plc (LAND)  has offered
to swap its 50 percent share in a shopping center in Bristol for
most of  Hammerson Plc (HMSO) ’s  London  office portfolio, the Times of
London reported, without saying where it got the information.  Hammerson, which owns Bristol’s Cabot Circus shopping
center, valued at more than 500 million pounds ($768 million)
with Land Securities, is also considering offers for part or all
of its London office blocks from bidders including Oxford
Properties and Brookfield Properties, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
