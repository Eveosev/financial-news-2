Switzerland ’s financial supervisory
authority, or Finma, is carrying out a risk assessment of banks
to prevent the financial crisis in  Europe  from spreading to the
the country’s banking industry,  Tages-Anzeiger  reported.  Finma is examining “scenarios and consequences,” though
the direct exposure for most financial institutions is “not
worryingly high,” the newspaper said, citing Finma spokesman
Tobias Lux. Finma requires counter-measures from individual
banks where necessary, including a ban on capital transfers to
countries affected by the crisis, the newspaper said, citing
Lux.  To contact the reporter on this story:
