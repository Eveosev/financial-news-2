Mobile-phone makers agreed on a new
standard for smaller SIM cards, overcoming a deadlock in which
Finland’s  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  had competing proposals.  The so-called “fourth form factor” will be 40 percent
smaller than the current smallest SIM card design, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute said in a  statement  on
its Web site, following a meeting held May 31 and June 1 in
Osaka, Japan. “It can be packaged and distributed in a way that
is backwards compatible with existing SIM card designs.”  ETSI agreed to pick Apple’s SIM card standard, beating a
proposal from Nokia, MacWorld said on its  website , citing
cardmaker Giesecke & Devrient. Spokespersons for ETSI and Nokia
couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  In March, a two-day meeting to adopt a format from
competing proposals by Apple and Nokia finished without reaching
a decision. The smartcards that identify wireless subscribers
are standardized to reduce industry costs and give consumers
freedom to switch handsets and networks. Smaller versions permit
the design of thinner phones.  To contact the reporters on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
