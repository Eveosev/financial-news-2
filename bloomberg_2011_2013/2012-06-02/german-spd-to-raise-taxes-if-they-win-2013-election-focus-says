Germany ’s main opposition Social
Democratic Party plans tax increases if it wins next year’s
federal election, its chairman,  Sigmar Gabriel , told  Focus 
magazine.  Since Germany is committed to rolling back its deficit, the
government would need to tap new tax sources to boost spending
on education, Gabriel was cited as saying in an interview.  The SPD would raise the top rate of income tax to 49
percent from 42 percent for single people earning over 100,000
euros ($124,000) per year and couples earning over 200,000
euros, Gabriel was cited as saying.  The party would also increase old-age care insurance to 2.5
percent of gross pay from 1.9 percent, boost dues on profit on
capital investments and reintroduce a  wealth tax  for the highest
earners, he said. The election is due in the fall of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
