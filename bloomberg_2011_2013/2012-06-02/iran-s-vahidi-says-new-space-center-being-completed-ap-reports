Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi
said the construction of a new space center to launch satellites
into orbit is being completed, the  Associated Press  reported,
citing the official Islamic Republic News Agency.  The comments are Iran’s first confirmation that it’s
building the center, whose location wasn’t disclosed, AP said.
The same rocket technology used to launch satellites into orbit
can be modified to make intercontinental warheads, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
