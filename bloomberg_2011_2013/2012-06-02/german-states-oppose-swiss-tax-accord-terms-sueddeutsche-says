Germany’s opposition-led states
oppose the terms of a tax accord brokered by the federal
government and Switzerland, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported,
citing talks held by the regional heads of government yesterday.  Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government needs the support of
the upper house of parliament to ratify the  tax treaty , the
newspaper said. The upper house, or Bundesrat, is dominated by
the opposition Social Democrats and Green Party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
