Germany  is set to fulfill the deficit
rules spelled out in the yet unratified Fiscal Compact in 2013,
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said in an interview with
the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung .  In the interview to be published tomorrow, Schaeuble
dismissed fears expressed by Germanyâ€™s states that the treaty
enforces deficit rules that are too strict. By next year,
Germany will already have a composite deficit that takes the
three levels of government into account, he said.  Schaeuble in the interview urged the states to back the
compact -- an international treaty -- in the upper house of
parliament where they are represented. The chamber is dominated
by opposition-led states who say the plan will force them to run
balanced budgets from 2014, conflicting with a national rule
that gives them until 2020.  The compact requires its signatories to limit their so-
called structural deficits to 0.5 percent of gross domestic
product by the medium-term. Structural budgets refer to regular
government accounts that are stripped of one-off outlays such as
 disaster relief  or stimulus spending adopted when an external
shock causes economic growth to plunge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
