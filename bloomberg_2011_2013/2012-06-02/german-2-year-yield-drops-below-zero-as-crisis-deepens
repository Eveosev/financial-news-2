German two-year note yields fell
below zero for the first time as the euro-region’s deepening
crisis saw investors willing to sacrifice any return in exchange
for holding the region’s safest assets.  The 10-year borrowing costs of  Austria ,  Belgium ,  Finland ,
 France ,  Germany  and the Netherlands dropped to records as euro-
area unemployment rose to a record and Italy missed its target
at a sale of bonds, driving investors to the region’s safer
government securities. Spanish bonds dropped for a fourth week,
pushing the 10-year yield above 6.5 percent after nationalized
lender Bankia group said it will seek 19 billion euros ($23.5
billion) of state support.  “We’ve seen German two-year yields turn negative in a
classic flight to safety,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
 London . “Investors remain concerned about the preservation of
their capital, rather than the return on it.”  The German two-year yield slid to as low as minus 0.012
percent, the first time the rate has been  negative , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield was at 0.007 percent at
4:16 p.m. London time yesterday, down four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, this week. The price of the zero percent note
due in June 2014 was at 99.985 percent of face value.  Italy’s bond yields surged after the nation missed its
maximum target for sales of five- and 10-year securities at
auctions on May 30.  Spain  is scheduled to sell bonds maturing
between 2014 and 2022 on June 7.  Unemployment Record  Spain’s 10-year yield rose 19 basis points this week to 6.5
percent, while Italian benchmark debt added six basis points to
5.73 percent.  Separate reports yesterday showed euro-region unemployment
rose to 11 percent in March and April, the most on record and
U.S. employers added the smallest number of workers in a year in
May.  A survey on May 30 showed economic confidence in the euro
area declined more than economists forecast last month to the
lowest in 2 1/2 years.  The  10-year bund  rate dropped 20 basis points this week to
1.17 percent after reaching 1.127 percent, the lowest since
Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1989. Its seven-week
decline is the longest run since May 27 last year. Two-, five-
and 30-year yields also fell to records, along with U.K. and
U.S. 10-year debt.  French 10-year yields dropped 29 basis points to 2.23
percent after falling to a record 2.071 percent yesterday. The
same day, rates on similar-maturity Austrian debt fell to 1.919
percent, Belgian yields fell to 2.743 percent, Dutch 10-year
rates retreated to 1.486 percent and Finnish yields declined to
1.385 percent, all the lowest on record.  ECB Rate  The  European Central Bank  will keep its main refinancing
rate at a record-low 1 percent on June 6, according to the
median estimate of 58 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Twelve
of the economists predict a cut of at least 25 basis points.  German debt has returned 4.7 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities have lost 5.2
percent, and Italian bonds rose 6.8 percent, the indexes show.  -- Editors: Mark McCord, Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporters on this story:
