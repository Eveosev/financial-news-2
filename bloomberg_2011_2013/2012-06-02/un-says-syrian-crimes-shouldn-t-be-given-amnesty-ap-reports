There should be no amnesty for the
most serious crimes committed in  Syria , United Nations
Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in an interview
with the  Associated Press .  Pillay was responding to a question about whether she would
oppose an agreement for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give
up power in exchange for an amnesty, AP said. While it may be
politically expedient to undertake not to prosecute, the worst
crimes shouldn’t go unpunished, Pillay said, according to AP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
