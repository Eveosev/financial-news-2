Bankia SA (BKIA)  former Chairman  Rodrigo
Rato  said the new head of Spain’s third-biggest lender
overstated losses at the institution while requesting a
“brutal” recapitalization by the state,  El Mundo  reported.  Rato said his successor, Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri,
presented possible future losses as real losses when requesting
state aid that causes serious damage to the interests of
shareholders, taxpayers and the Spanish banking industry, the
newspaper reported, citing a three-page memo Rato circulated
among board members of Bankia’s Caja Madrid unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
