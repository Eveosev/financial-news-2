Race favorite Camelot, trained by
Aidan O’Brien and ridden by his son Joseph, ran to a five-length
victory in the Epsom Derby.  Camelot, at 8-13 odds, charged down the stretch to pass
stablemate Astrology and win the nine-horse race for 3-year-olds
at Epsom Downs in Surrey, south of  London .  “This is the one everyone wants in racing,” Camelot’s co-
owner Derrick Smith told the British Broadcasting Corp. “To win
the English Derby is a dream come true.”  Having already won the 2000 Guineas, Camelot can become the
first horse since Nijinsky in 1970 to capture English racing’s
Triple Crown by winning the St. Leger Stakes in September.  It’s the third Derby win for O’Brien and the first for his
19-year-old jockey son. They are the first father-son tandem to
win the race.  Main Sequence, at 9-1, also made a late charge to beat
Astrology, at 13-2, by a head for second place.  Queen Elizabeth  was in attendance as the Derby was the
opening event of the four-day Diamond Jubilee celebrating her 60
years on the throne. Carlton House, a horse owned by the Queen,
finished third in last year’s race.  The Derby was first run in 1779 when Edward Smith Stanley,
the 12th Earl of Derby, organized a competition for himself and
his friends. It was extended to its current length five years
later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
