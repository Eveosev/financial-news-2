The U.K. unit of Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP,
the U.S. law firm that’s in bankruptcy proceedings, has
liabilities of at least $175 million, the Financial Times said,
citing the company’s last  London  partner, Mark Fennessy.  The U.K. unit was profitable and acted as guarantor to
secure the bank and bondholder debt of the U.S. firm, Fennessy
told the FT on May 29, the newspaper reported today. Fennessy
until May 28 was coordinating the winding down of Dewey’s U.K.
and French operations, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
