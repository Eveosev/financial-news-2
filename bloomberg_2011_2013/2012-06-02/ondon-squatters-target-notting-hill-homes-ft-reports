London  squatters are increasingly
targeting houses in exclusive neighborhoods, including Regents
Park, North Kensington and Notting Hill, the Financial Times
reported, citing court records for eviction orders.  Applications for court orders used to evict squatters rose
to 51 in the year to October 2011 from 25 in 2010 in Londonâ€™s
richest boroughs, the paper said. The trend is blamed on the
economic downturn, high unemployment and an increasing number of
homes owned by foreign buyers who leave them unoccupied, the FT
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
