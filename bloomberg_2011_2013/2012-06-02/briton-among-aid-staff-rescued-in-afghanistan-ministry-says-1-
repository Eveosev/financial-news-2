Helen Johnston, a British aid worker
with Swiss-based Medair, has been rescued after being kidnapped
in  Afghanistan , the U.K. government said today.  Also rescued were Moragwa Oirere, a Kenyan aid worker, and
two Afghan aid workers, the Foreign Office in  London  said in an
e-mailed statement. All four had been abducted in Badakhshan
Province in northeast Afghanistan on May 22, it said.  “They are all now safe,” the statement said. “Helen and
Moragwa are receiving support from British Embassy staff in
Kabul. The two Afghan aid workers are returning to their
families in Badakhshan.”  The Foreign Office said the rescue by coalition forces was
authorised by Prime Minister  David Cameron , who said all four
hostages were rescued safely, no British troops were injured and
a number of Taliban and hostage-takers were killed.  “It was an extraordinarily brave, breath-taking even,
operation that our troops had to carry out,” Cameron told the
British Broadcasting Corp. “I pay tribute to their skill and
dedication.”  He said the rescue should serve as a warning to terrorists
who take British nationals hostage.  “They should know if they take British citizens as hostage
we do not pay ransoms, we do not trade prisoners,” Cameron
said. “They can expect a swift and brutal end.”  In a statement issued through the Foreign Office,
Johnston’s family said they were “deeply grateful” to her
rescuers.  “We are delighted and hugely relieved by the wonderful
news that Helen and all her colleagues have been freed,” they
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
