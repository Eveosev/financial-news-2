Maria Dolores Dancausa, chief
executive officer of  Bankinter SA (BKT) , said that the measures the
Spanish government introduced to bolster the banking system risk
undermining healthy lenders,  El Mundo  reported.  The increasing provisions demanded by the government may
impose too great a burden on banks that aren’t facing future
losses and that public support for  Bankia SA (BKIA)  tilts the market
against well-run institutions that didn’t need bailing out,
Dancausa said in an interview with the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
