U.K. gilts rose for a sixth week,
pushing yields to record lows, as  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis
and signs Britain’s economy is deteriorating fueled demand for
the safest securities.  Yields on all maturities fell below 3 percent after Spain’s
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said yesterday the country was
in a “very difficult situation,” and as Greek leaders prepared
for a second general election to end a political stalemate.
Economic reports yesterday showed euro-area unemployment climbed
to a record and U.S. payrolls rose less than analysts forecast.
The pound fell for a fifth week against the dollar after U.K.
 manufacturing  shrank last month.  “Rising worries about the health of the Spanish bank
system and ongoing political risk in  Greece  have been the key
driving forces for the safe-haven rally in gilts,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a strategist in Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd., a broker for banks. “Disappointing U.K. data has been
another positive for UK government bonds.”  The yield on the  benchmark  10-year gilt fell 22 basis
points, or 0.22 percentage point this week, to 1.53 percent at 5
p.m. London time yesterday. The 4 percent bond due in March 2022
gained 2.16 or 21.60 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,594) face
amount, to 122.26. The decline in yields was the most since the
five days ended Nov. 4.  Factory Output  A gauge of U.K. factory output, based on a survey by Markit
Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply ,
fell to 45.9 from 50.2 in April,  Markit Economics  said
yesterday. U.S. payrolls climbed by 69,000 last month, less than
the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey, after a
77,000 gain in April, the Labor Department said in  Washington .  “This does not bode well for U.K. growth,” Kathleen Brooks, research director in London at Forex.com, a unit of
online currency trading company Gain Capital Holdings Inc.,
wrote in an e-mailed note yesterday. “This is a very
deflationary report, supports more quantitative easing and is
sterling negative.”  The pound slipped 1.9 percent against the dollar this week
to $1.5376 after dropping to $1.5269, the lowest since Jan. 13.
The U.K. currency declined 1 percent to 80.74 pence per euro.  Economists predict U.K. reports next week will show
expansion in services and construction slowed last month. The
 Bank of England  will announce decisions on  interest rates  and
asset purchases on June 7.  Gilts returned 3.1 percent this year through May 31,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
