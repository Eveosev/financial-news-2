Colombia’s central bank may start a
new cycle of lowering  interest rates , Carlos Gustavo Cano, co-
director of the bank, told La Republica in an interview.  The benchmark rate is now neutral, Cano is quoted as
telling the newspaper. The bank may start lowering it should the
European crisis keep deteriorating and growth in emerging
economies such as China and Brazil keep slowing while inflation
in Colombia is decelerating, he said.  The central bank is “very” concerned about the weakness
of the construction and manufacturing industries in Colombia,
Cano said, according to the newspaper. It wouldn’t make sense to
keep raising the interest rate in order to slow  consumer lending 
while damaging the rest of the economy, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
