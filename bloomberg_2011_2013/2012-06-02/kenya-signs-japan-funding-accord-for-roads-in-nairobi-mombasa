Kenya  signed agreements with Japan
for 31 billion Kenyan shillings ($360 million) in loans and
grants to improve roads, which may reduce the cost of
transporting goods, Finance Minister Robinson Githae said.  The loan for 28.9 billion shillings involves building a
road from Mombasa port’s container terminal and a bypass linking
the seaside city’s South Coast to the mainland, Githae told a
media briefing in the capital, Nairobi, today.  Kenya also will receive a grant of 1.7 billion shillings to
widen 4.7 kilometers (2.9 miles) along Ngong Road in Nairobi to
four lanes as well as put down sidewalks and drainage systems,
Githae said.  Growing investment to improve the road network in  East
Africa ’s largest economy will lead to savings for businesses and
consumers, Akihiko Tanaka, president of the Japan International
Cooperation Agency, said at the same event. Transport expenses
account for 40 percent of the price of goods in Kenya, he said.  Mombasa has the busiest port in East Africa, serving
landlocked countries including South Sudan,  Uganda  and  Rwanda .  To contact the reporter on this story:
