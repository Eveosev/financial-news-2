Heineken NV (HEIA)  moved excess cash from
Greece as a preparation for a possible exit of the country from
the euro,  Het Financieele Dagblad  reported today, citing an
unidentified spokesman.  Heineken transfers the money from euros into U.S. dollars
or pounds when possible, the Dutch newspaper reported.  The brewer expects Greece to remain within the euro area
and is still investing in the country, the spokesman is cited as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
