Treasuries rallied, pushing 10- and
30-year yields to all-time lows, after the economy added fewer
jobs in May than economists forecast, and concern festered that
the European sovereign-debt crisis may spread.  U.S. 10-year note yields  dropped below  1.5 percent for the
first time, posting the biggest weekly drop in eight months,
after the Labor Department reported U.S. employment growth was
the least in a year. Morgan Stanley said the probability of more
central bank policy stimulus reached 80 percent as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  prepared to testify before
Congress on June 7 about the outlook for the  U.S. economy .  “Given the fear in  Europe  and the weak employment number,
rates continue to press lower, beyond levels anyone expected,”
said Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim
Partners LLC, who oversees more than $125 billion from  Santa
Monica ,  California . “This event was another nail in the coffin,
which makes some sort of policy accommodation a foregone
conclusion.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  fell 29 basis points for the
week, or 0.29 percentage point, to 1.45 percent in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Traders prices. The 1.75 percent
security maturing in May 2022 gained 2 20/32, or $26.25 per
$1,000 face amount, to 102 3/4. The yield reached an all-time
low yesterday for a third consecutive day, trading at as little
as 1.4387 percent.  Long Bonds  Thirty-year bond yields declined 32 basis points to 2.52
percent, reaching as low as 2.5089 percent, below the record
2.5090 percent on Dec. 18, 2008, according to  Fed figures 
beginning in 1953. Five-year notes set a record at 0.59 percent
while seven-year debt established an all-time low 0.91 percent.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  decreased 
their net-short position in 10-year note futures by 55,112
contracts, or 40 percent, in the week ending May 29, according
to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Speculative
short positions, or bets prices will fall, still outnumbered
long positions by 81,078 contracts on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  The difference between the yields on the 10-year and 30-
year securities narrowed to almost the least since January on
reduced concern inflation will erode the value of fixed-income
assets. The gap narrowed to 108 basis points, close to the least
since January. It closed at 107 basis points on May 21 after
widening to a 2012 high of 120 basis points on May 1.  Yield Differences  The difference between the yield on the two-year and 10-
year notes, dropped to 121 basis points, the least since June
2008.  “It’s a recalibration of growth expectations, as well as a
pullback of global inflationary pressures,” said  Ian Lyngen , a
government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut .  Treasuries had their best performance last month since
August, returning 1.8 percent, reflecting the declining
stability of the 17-member euro currency amid a worsening
sovereign-debt crisis, according to indexes compiled by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. The MSCI All-Country World Index of
 shares  slid 8.9 percent in the same period. The euro declined
6.6 percent versus the dollar in May, the most since September.  U.S. 10-year yields are down from 5.3 percent in June 2007,
before the financial crisis intensified, and below the average
of 4.96 percent during the past 20 years.  Next Level  “There was supposed to be resistance at 1.50 percent, but
with a lousy employment report, it didn’t amount to much,” said
FTN Financial Chief Economist Christopher Low, the most accurate
forecaster of Treasury note yields in 2011. Resistance is an
area on a chart where pre-established orders may be clustered.  “People have been saying 1.25 percent, but the trading
over the next few days will determine if 1.25 percent is
realistic,” said Low who was the only one among 70 analysts in
a Bloomberg News survey who predicted the yield would fall to 2
percent by the end of last year.  Valuation measures show Treasuries are at the most
expensive levels ever. The term premium, a model created by
economists at the Fed, touched negative 0.96 percent. A negative
reading indicates investors are willing to accept yields below
what’s considered fair value.  The U.S. central bank sold $8.6 billion of Treasuries due
from September 2012 to April 2013 yesterday, according to the
Fed Bank of  New York ’s  website . The sales are part of its
program to replace $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its
holdings with longer maturities by the end of this month to
support the economy by keeping down borrowing costs.  Fed Speculation  Investors have stepped up speculation that added stimulus
would focus on home-loan bonds after Fed Chairman Bernanke sent
a study to Congress in January that highlighted how housing is
restraining the economic recovery.  The 69,000 jobs added last month were less than the most-
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News Survey. The median
forecast of 85 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before
yesterday’s jobs report, was for an increase of 150,000 jobs.
The  unemployment rate  rose to 8.2 percent, the Labor Department
said.  Gross domestic product climbed at a 1.9 percent annual rate
from January through March, down from a 2.2 percent prior
estimate, revised Commerce Department figures showed on May 31.  Global Outlook  “Given the outlook for the global economy and the U.S., it
looks like we’re joining Asia and Europe for a slowing of the
economy,” said Gary Pollack, who helps manage $12 billion as
head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private
Wealth Management unit in New York. “We could go to lower
levels in yields.”  German and U.K. yields fell to all-time lows after Spanish
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said the future of the euro is
at stake. German two-year note yields fell below zero for the
first time and 10-year yields on Austrian, Belgian, Dutch,
Finnish and French bonds dropped to records.  As U.S. 10-year note yields drop to record lows, they are
still yielding more than benchmark bond markets around the
world. Yields on the 10-year note are 16 basis points  higher 
than the average for comparable debt of nations from  Germany  to
 Australia , above the average of 12 basis points in the past
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ’Serious Slowdown’  “We are on the edge of a more serious slowdown than what
was otherwise anticipated coming into the data,” said
 Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.9 billion as chief
investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New
York. “On top of the European issues, the further decline in
growth here and in other parts of the world are manifesting
safe-haven buying.”  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, which represents
traders’ expectations for the rate of inflation during the life
of the bonds, fell to 2.02 percentage points, almost the lowest
since January. It touched a 2012 low of 1.9 percentage points on
Jan. 3 and a high of 2.45 percentage points on March 20.  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to
set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which gauges the average inflation rate between 2017 and 2022,
was 2.47 percent on May 30, down from a 2012 high of 2.78
percent on March 19.  “In the U.S. we have an aggressive central bank, which has
widely telegraphed that if there’s a slowing in growth they will
act,” said  Priya Misra , head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed. “That’s what to me provides a floor in
rates, not so much in real rates, but in break-evens.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
