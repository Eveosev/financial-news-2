Kenyan forces plan to seize al-
Shabaab’s last major bastion, the port city of Kismayo, by the
end of the Somali government’s transition period on Aug. 20, the
 Saturday Nation  reported, citing Chief General Julius Karangi.  Capturing Kismayo will deprive the al-Qaeda-linked militant
group of a key source of revenue, after Kenyan soldiers fighting
as part of an African Union operation seized Afmadow town
earlier this week, the Nairobi-based newspaper said today.  Kenya ’s military began an incursion into southern Somalia
in October to drive out al-Shabaab, which has waged a five-year
insurgency against the United Nations-backed administration of
President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. Kenya began the assault to
secure its borders after blaming the rebel group for the murder
of a British tourist at a luxury resort and the abduction of at
least four foreign holidaymakers and aid workers in Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
