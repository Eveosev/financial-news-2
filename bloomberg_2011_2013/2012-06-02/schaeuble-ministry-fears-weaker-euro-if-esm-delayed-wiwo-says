Germany’s Finance Ministry, led by by
 Wolfgang Schaeuble , fears the euro could weaken further against
the  U.S. dollar  -- touching the $1.10-mark -- if the euro’s new
rescue fund is delayed,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing
officials it didn’t name.  Leaders in the euro area have pledged to have the European
Stability Mechanism up and running on July 1, but the new and
permanent fund may be delayed as German lawmakers wrangle over
its approval in parliament, said the business weekly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
