Planet IB Ltd. will “not shy away”
for mounting a “hostile takeover” bid to acquire Egyptian
investment bank EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, Chief Executive Officer
Ahmed El Houssieny said today.  “I have done  Egypt ’s first corporate bond issuance,
Egypt’s first leveraged buyout, Egypt’s first securitization
transaction,” he said in a statement to Bloomberg. “I will not
shy away from Egypt’s first hostile takeover.”  Planet had said that a tender offer to buy Cairo-based EFG-
Hermes, the biggest publicly traded Arab investment bank, hinged
on the company’s management allowing Planet to conduct due
diligence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
