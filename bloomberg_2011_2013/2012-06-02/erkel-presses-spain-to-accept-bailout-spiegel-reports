German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  are urging  Spain ’s
government to take an international bailout as it struggles to
shore up the country’s banks, Der Spiegel magazine reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Spain alone cannot solve its banking troubles and Merkel
and Schaeuble want Spain to tap Europe’s temporary bailout fund,
the European Financial Stability Facility, for aid for banks,
Spiegel said.  Schaeuble pressed Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos
on a bailout during the latter’s visit to Berlin last week, and
de Guindos rebuffed him, Spiegel said.  German government experts estimate that Spain’s banking
industry will need a capital injection of 50-90 billion euros,
Spiegel said.  Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s chief spokesman, declined to
comment on the report when contacted by phone today by Bloomberg
News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
