Boston  Marathon winner Lelisa Desisa
gave his 2013 championship medal to the city as a gift to honor
the victims and families affected by the April bombing that
killed three and injured more than 260 people.  The 23-year-old from  Ethiopia  presented the medal to Mayor
Thomas Menino yesterday in what he said was a “gesture of my
solidarity with the victims of this senseless act of violence.”
It was Desisa’s first trip to Boston since the April 15 attack.  “Less than two hours after I had crossed the finish line
as this year’s champion, my joy turned to sorrow as I learned
the tragic news of the death and the injury to so many innocent
people,” Desisa said in a June 18 statement announcing the
presentation. “This day brought pain to many families and
tremendous sorrow into many homes.”  Desisa finished as the runner-up by seven seconds to
Kenya’s Stephen Sambu in yesterday’s Boston Athletic
Association’s 10-kilometer event, the city’s first race since
the Boston Marathon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
