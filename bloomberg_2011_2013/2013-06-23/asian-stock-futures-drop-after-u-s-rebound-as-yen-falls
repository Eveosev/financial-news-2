U.S. stocks fell after Chinese
equities entered a bear market on concern a cash crunch will
hurt growth. Treasuries pared losses on speculation investors
overreacted to a possible reduction of central bank stimulus.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index sank 1.2 percent at 4 p.m.
in New York, trimming an earlier drop of 2 percent. Ten-year
Treasury note yields rose one basis point after earlier jumping
to the highest level since 2011. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  of China’s
biggest companies tumbled 6.3 percent, the most since August
2009 and taking its drop from this year’s high to more than 20
percent. Copper fell to the lowest level in almost three years
and aluminum extended the longest slump since 1987.  Richard Fisher, president of the Fed Bank of  Dallas , said
investors shouldn’t overreact to the central bank’s plans to
reduce the pace of asset purchases. China’s central bank said
there’s a reasonable amount of liquidity in the financial system
and urged banks to control risks from credit expansion,
signaling no relief from a cash squeeze. The nation’s overnight
repurchase  rate  is 6.47 percent, more than double this year’s
average.  “Investors have been shaken by the concept of rising
interest rates and a reduction in stimulus from the Federal
Reserve, coupled with the uncertainty regarding effectively how
robust the Chinese central banking system is,”  Ethan Anderson,
senior portfolio manager for Rehmann Financial in Grand Rapids,
 Michigan , said by phone. His firm manages about $1.5 billion.
“We found ourselves in a headline-dependent environment, which
is difficult for investors to function.”  ‘Feral Hogs’  Global equities tumbled last week, with the MSCI All-Country World Index sinking the most in more than a year, after
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said bond buying may be scaled back
this year should risks to the U.S. economy continue to decrease.
The equity gauge has fallen 8.7 percent from its peak on May 21,
trimming this year’s gains to 2 percent.  Two Federal Reserve presidents with opposing views on how
much stimulus the U.S. economy needs today emphasized that
policy remains accommodative. Fisher, who doesn’t vote on
monetary policy this year, said in a speech in  London  that
“what we’re talking about here is dialing back.” He said,
“The word ’exit’ is not appropriate.”  Fisher, in an interview with the Financial Times published
on its website today, said investors behaved like “feral hogs”
after the June 19 comments by Bernanke.  Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota, who has
called for easier policy, said to reporters in a conference call
that the Fed must emphasize in its statement that policy will
remain accommodative “for a considerable time” after the end
of quantitative easing.  ‘Dial Back’  “Fisher’s comments seemed to dial back some of the
negative rhetoric that people had in terms of Chairman
Bernanke’s comments last week,” Michael James, a managing
director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los
Angeles, said in a phone interview. “This remains a trader and
sentiment-driven market that’s susceptible to swings in either
direction at a drop of a hat.”  All  10 industries  in the S&P 500 fell today, with raw-material and financial companies dropping the most. Bank of
America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. tumbled more than 2
percent. Boeing Co. and Hewlett-Packard Co. slid at least 2.1
percent to pace  declines  among the largest companies.  2007 Record  The S&P 500 slumped to its lowest level since April during
the day, briefly slipping  below  a 2007 closing high of 1,565.15.
The index surpassed that peak in March, recovering all its
losses from the financial crisis.  The benchmark gauge has fallen 5.8 percent since a record
on May 21, ending its longest run in more than six years of
going without a retreat of 5 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The index spent 149 days through June 21 without incurring
a 5 percent loss from a peak, the longest since a 173-day
stretch ended Feb. 20, 2007, about eight months before the
financial crisis sent the market plunging 57 percent.  The S&P 500 has also lost 3.5 percent in June, poised to
snap a streak of seven straight monthly advances, the longest
winning streak since September 2009. The index has  rallied  as
much as 147 percent from its March 2009 low.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the
measure of options on the S&P 500 known as the VIX,  added  6.4
percent to 20.11.  Volatility Index  While U.S. equity volatility reached a six-month high last
week, expected stock swings are less than half as much as peaks
in the last four years and traders are pricing in little
increase for the rest of the year. Even after the gauge of
options prices on the S&P 500 increased 67 percent since March
through last week, it would have to rise 134 percent more to
reach its average high of 44 from 2009 to 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. VIX futures expiring in six months
trade only 10 percent higher than the index.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 1.7 percent, declining
for a fifth day in the longest losing streak in 13 months. The
gauge erased its gain for the year, and extended its retreat
from the May 22 high to more than 10 percent. The volume of
shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies was 27 percent
greater than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Emerging Markets  Erste Group Bank AG slid 8.5 percent as  Austria ’s biggest
lender said it will sell about 660 million euros ($865 million)
of new shares in the third quarter to help repay state aid.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell for a fifth day to a
one-year low, losing 1.7 percent. Benchmark gauges in South
Africa, the Czech Republic, the  Philippines  and  Thailand  lost at
least 2.4 percent.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
listed in Hong Kong slid 3.2 percent. The Shanghai Composite
Index, which tracks the largest mainland market, tumbled 5.3
percent, with trading volume 11 percent higher than the 30-day
average. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its 2013 forecast for
China’s economy and said the cash squeeze is hurting growth.  Chinese banks must control liquidity risks from fast
capital expansion, especially credit, the central bank said in a
statement dated June 17 and issued today, signaling no relief to
a cash squeeze which risks exacerbating an economic slowdown.  ‘Credit Binge’  “ China  has had a credit binge for way too long,” Vasu Menon, the head of content and research at OCBC Bank Ltd. in
 Singapore , told Bloomberg TV. “The government is trying to
rebalance the economy, trying to downsize the shadow banking
system. All that means credit is going to remain fairly tight.”  Treasuries pared earlier losses as yields at the highest
levels since 2011 attracted traders. The 10-year note yield rose
one basis point to 2.54 percent after climbing as much as 13
basis points to 2.66 percent.  Bonds slid across the globe earlier on expectation that a
reduction in accommodation from the Fed will lead to an eventual
end of record low central bank borrowing rates. The yield on
 Australia ’s 10-year government bond surged 28 basis points to
4.04 percent, reaching the highest since April 2012.  Germany ’s
10-year bund yield rose nine basis points to 1.81 percent, the
highest since March 2012.  U.K. 10-year yields reached 2.59 percent, the highest in
almost 20 months, and Switzerland’s 10-year rate exceeded 1
percent for the first time since Oct. 31, 2011.  Economic Reports  The dollar declined less than 0.1 percent to $1.3123 per
euro after appreciating to the strongest level since June 5. The
U.S. currency rose earlier versus the majority of its 16 major
counterparts before U.S. reports tomorrow that economists said
will show durable-goods orders gained and house prices
increased. The U.S. currency weakened 0.2 percent to at 97.72
yen, while the Swedish krona slid to a seven-month low versus
the dollar.  Copper fell 2.3 percent to settle at $3.0285 a pound after
touching $2.9935, the lowest for a most-active contract since
July 2010. Aluminum slid for the 13th consecutive day, the
longest slump since at least June 1987.  Gold and silver fell as platinum plunged to the lowest
since November 2009. Gold futures declined 1.2 percent to settle
at $1,277.10 as Goldman Sachs trimmed its price forecasts
through 2014. Silver dropped 2.3 percent to $19.493 an ounce and
platinum slumped 2.9 percent to $1,329.10 an ounce, after
reaching the lowest level since November 2009.  Crude oil gained for the first time in four days after
three pipelines in  Alberta  were shut because of flooding. Crude
for August delivery rose 1.6 percent, the most since June 3, to
settle at $95.18 a barrel. Earlier, prices fell as much as $1.02
to $92.67 a barrel, the lowest level since June 4. Enbridge Inc.
has yet to restart the pipelines shut by a leak related to
severe flooding and hasn’t offered a timeline for service
resumption.  To contact the reporters on this story:
