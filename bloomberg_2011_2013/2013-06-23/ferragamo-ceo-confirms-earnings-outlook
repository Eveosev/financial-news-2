Salvatore Ferragamo SpA (SFER) ’s second-quarter revenue growth is in line with the first quarter’s,
justifying the Italian luxury-goods maker’s outlook for 2013
earnings growth, Chief Executive Officer Michele Norsa said.  “Growth continues to be sustained,” Norsa said in an
interview today before the Florence, Italy-based company’s men’s
fashion show in Milan. North America “continues to give
positive signals” and demand has picked up in Japan with
consumers there buying more as the yen weakens.  Ferragamo sales rose 8.6 percent in the  first quarter , or
9.6 percent excluding currency shifts.  Competitors including  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) 
and  Kering (KER)  SA-owned Gucci in April reported the weakest
quarterly sales growth in more than three years as demand
softened in Europe and Asia. Worldwide sales of luxury goods
will increase as much as 5 percent this year, about the same as
in 2012, Bain & Co. estimates.  While Ferragamo hasn’t imposed significant price increases
in  Japan , it will do so slightly for new collections to narrow
the disparity with other markets, Norsa said.  “Clients are very attentive to pricing trends,” the CEO
said. “They buy where it’s convenient.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
