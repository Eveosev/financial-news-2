Hungary’s  economic-sentiment  index
jumped to its strongest level in two years in June, driven by a
surge in optimism among businesses.  The index rose to minus 14.8, the best reading since June
2011, from minus 16.7 in May, the GKI research institute in
Budapest said in an e-mailed statement. Business confidence
increased to minus 6.9 from minus 10.5, matching the strongest
since July 2011, while the consumer-confidence gauge fell to
minus 37.3 from minus 34.4.  Business sentiment improved “palpably” in all corporate
segments, except for trading companies, and expectations for the
economy’s future performance rose significantly,’’ GKI said.  Hungary’s  economy  exited a recession in the first quarter
and the European Union on June 21 released the country from its
monitoring for budget offenders, a victory for Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban . The Cabinet will raise the financial transaction
tax and the levy on phone calls this year after introducing the
EU’s highest bank tax to ensure the  deficit  stays within the 27-nation bloc’s limit of 3 percent of economic output as inflation
hovers near the lowest levels since 1974.  Gross domestic product grew 0.7 percent from the previous
three months in the first quarter, expanding for the first time
since 2011. The Cabinet forecasts 0.7 percent growth this year,
with Orban predicting expansion of as much as 1 percent.  GKI’s indexes are calculated as a balance of positive and
negative answers to questions about the outlook for the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
