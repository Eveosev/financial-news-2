India  beat  England  by five runs in a
rain-disrupted Champions Trophy final, extending the tournament
host’s wait for its first global one-day cricket title.  Chasing a target of 130 in a match reduced to 20 overs a
side from the scheduled 50 at Edgbaston, Birmingham, yesterday,
England needed 20 off the last 16 balls with  Ravi Bopara  and
Eoin Morgan at the crease. The home team lost four wickets for
three runs and finished on 124-8.  India, which ended the eight-nation International Cricket
Council event unbeaten, added the Champions Trophy to the World
Cup title it secured in 2011. The win made Mahendra Singh Dhoni
the first national cricket captain to lead his team to victory
in all three major ICC competitions after India also won the
inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007.  “They handled the pressure really well,” Dhoni said of
his team at the post-match presentation. “People talk a lot
about technique, but good players adapt to pressure well.”  Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took two wickets for 14 and
man-of-the-match Ravindra Jadeja claimed 2-24 after scoring 33
not out off 25 balls in India’s total of 129-7.  The final, which had been scheduled to start at 10:30 a.m.
local time yesterday, was delayed until 4:20 p.m. by rain and
there were further interruptions for more showers.  Virat Kohli top scored with 43 for India, with Shikhar
Dhawan adding 31 to finish as the tournament’s top run-getter
with 363. Bopara led England’s bowlers with 3-20, including the
wickets of Suresh Raina and Dhoni in a maiden over.  England Chase  England captain  Alastair Cook  was dismissed in the second
over of his team’s run chase, caught in the slips with the score
on 3. Dhoni then stumped Jonathan Trott on 20, and Joe Root was
out for 7.  Ian Bell  was given out following a video review of another
stumping, in a close decision over whether he’d made his ground
by the time the bails were dislodged.  Morgan (33 runs) and Bopara (30 runs) lifted England to
110-4 with a 64-run fifth-wicket stand. The game then turned
when they were caught in successive balls by Ashwin off Ishant Sharma. Jos Buttler and  Tim Bresnan  soon followed, and  Stuart Broad  and  James Tredwell  failed to get to the victory target.  “It’s tough to take,” Cook said. “I’m proud of the way
the lads played, we just came up a little bit short.”  England had been seeking its first global 50-over trophy,
having lost three World Cup finals and finished as the runner-up
at the 2004 Champions Trophy. England won the World Twenty20 in
2010.  India, a two-time World Cup champion, was joint winner of
the Champions Trophy with  Sri Lanka  in 2002 in another game
disrupted by rain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
