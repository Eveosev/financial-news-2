Matomy Media Group is considering an
initial public offering in the U.S. as the developer of
technology for advertising platforms seeks to raise funds, the
vice president said.  “We are looking at opportunities,” Erez Gross, senior
vice president of mobile advertising at Matomy, said in a
 Bloomberg Television interview  on June 20 when asked whether the
company is considering an IPO. “There is great interest from
investors. We are looking around to consider what the options
are.”  Israeli companies from  Kamada Ltd. (KMDA) , a maker of treatments
for hereditary lung diseases, to Wix.com Inc., a provider of
online tools that help people create websites, are tapping
investor appetite for share sales. More than $20 billion was
raised globally through IPOs in the first quarter at a time when
trading volumes on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange are dwindling.  Matomy says it’s Israel’s largest online advertising
company with 2012 revenue of $210 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
