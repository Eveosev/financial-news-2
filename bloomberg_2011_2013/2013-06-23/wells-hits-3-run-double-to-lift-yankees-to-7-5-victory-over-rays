Vernon Wells  hit a three-run double
to lift the  New York Yankees  to a 7-5  Major League Baseball  win
over the Tampa Bay Rays.  Wells, 3-for-33 in his previous nine games, pinch-hit for
Chris Stewart with the bases loaded and two outs in the seventh
inning yesterday at Yankee Stadium.  “Through his struggles, I think his at-bats against
lefties were still pretty good,” manager  Joe Girardi  told
reporters. “We just liked the matchup. Vern’s been doing it for
a long time in big spots.”  Wells’ hit bounced above the right center wall where it hit
a fan’s glove. A fan interference ruling held Wells to a double,
though the umpires rules that all three runners could score.  “It was good to hit a ball and it not land in somebody’s
glove,” Wells said. “And it came at a great time.”  Zoilo Almonte, who played left field in place of Wells, was
1-for-2 with two walks and three runs batted in. The previous
night, he was 3-for-4 with a home run.  C.C. Sabathia (8-5) allowed five runs on six hits and
struck out two in seven innings.  Mariano Rivera  got his 26th
save after giving up one run and striking out one in the ninth
inning.  Joel Peralta (1-4) allowed three runs on one hit in 1/3
inning.  The Yankees (41-33) are in third place in the American
League East, 2 ½ games behind the Boston Red Sox (45-32) who
lost 10-3 to the Detroit Tigers last night. The Rays (38-37)
share last place in the division with the Toronto Blue Jays, six
games back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
