tumbled the most in more than a year, led by Emaar Properties
PJSC, as concern the U.S. may reduce fiscal stimulus prompted a
selloff in  emerging markets .  Emaar, the builder of the world’s tallest skyscraper,
declined to the lowest in two months and Dubai Financial Market,
the Persian Gulf’s only publicly traded stock market, slumped
5.8 percent. The DFM General Index retreated 2.6 percent, the
most since March 2012, to 2,299.78 at the close in Dubai.  Abu

11. Egypt’s EGX 30 fell 2.2 percent to the lowest in a year.  Emerging market stocks last week tumbled  5.6 percent , the
most in 13 months, as Federal Reserve Chairmen  Ben S. Bernanke 
said June 19 that the U.S. may halt bond purchases by mid-2014.
 China ’s manufacturing is shrinking at a faster pace this month,
adding to stresses in the economy and financial system after
interbank borrowing costs surged.  “Market sentiment is being negatively affected by what’s
happening worldwide, especially in emerging-market countries,”

by phone. “Chinese manufacturing data and news from the U.S.
Federal Reserve means sentiment and institutional presence will
both be weak in the coming few weeks at least.”  Yearly Performance  Dubai’s stocks are the second-best performing in 2013 among
