French President  Francois Hollande 
said he discussed the possible sale of Dassault Systemes SA-made
Rafale fighter jets with Qatar.  Dassault and Qatar are in negotiations, he said at a press
conference in the Arab emirate’s capital Doha.  France  provides
as much as three quarters of Qatar’s military hardware, Hollande
said.  The country, which shares the world’s biggest gas reservoir
with Iran, wants to replace its existing fleet of 12 Mirage
fighter jets with 24 to 36 new jets, Reuters reported June 19.
Dassault was in discussions to sell Rafale warplanes to the
United Arab Emirates in 2011.  The French President was on a two-day visit to Qatar where
he met with the Emir Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani and Prime
Minister Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabor Al Thani.  To contact the reporter on this story:
