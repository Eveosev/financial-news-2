Airways Ltd., the world’s largest cargo and freight carrier,

tighter liquidity,” said Michael Kurtz, Hong Kong-based chief
global equity strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s

easing in some geographies and cyclically improving data in
others will continue to support risk assets.”  Futures contracts on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
of mainland Chinese companies trading in Hong Kong retreated 1.1
percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded

equities gauge, retreated 12 percent from the closing level on
