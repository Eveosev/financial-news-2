Spain  advanced to a Confederations
Cup soccer semifinal against Italy after beating Nigeria 3-0 to
top its group at the eight-team event in  Brazil .  Uruguay set up a final-four meeting with the host nation by
routing Tahiti 8-0 in yesterday’s other match as the group stage
of the World Cup tuneup tournament ended with no draws for the
first time in its nine editions.  Left-back Jordi Alba scored at the start and end of the
match in Fortaleza with striker  Fernando Torres  getting the
other for world champion Spain, which defeated Italy 4-0 in last
year’s European Championship final. The win extended Spain’s
unbeaten streak in competitive matches to a record 28 games.  Abel Hernandez netted a first-half hat trick and added a
67th-minute penalty kick in Uruguay’s rout of Tahiti in Recife.
 Luis Suarez  scored twice in the last 10 minutes, while Diego
Perez and Nicolas Lodeiro got the other goals. Oceania champion
Tahiti leaves the tournament having allowed 24 goals in its
three Group B matches.  “This type of game shows the massive difference between
professional and amateur football,” Tahiti coach Eddy Etaeta,
who only had one full-time player in his squad, said on the
tournament’s website. “It’s an abyss.”  Brazil hosts Uruguay in the all-South American first
semifinal in  Belo Horizonte  on June 26, with Spain taking on
Italy the following day in Fortaleza.  The final, which will be the first title decider between a
South American and European team since Denmark beat Argentina in
1995, is scheduled June 30 at Rio de Janeiro’s Maracana stadium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
