Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC) ’s
founders, together with the Kazakh government, are preparing an
offer that values the mining company at 3.04 billion pounds
($4.7 billion), the bidding group said.  The proposal by ENRC’s  Alexander Machkevitch , Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov and the Kazakhstan government would
offer stockholders $2.65 in cash and 0.23  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  shares
for each ENRC share held, the Bidco group said today in an e-mailed statement.  Bidco is “in the advanced stages of preparing a possible
offer” equivalent to 234.3 pence per ENRC share at current
exchange rates, the newly incorporated group said in the
statement. ENRC closed June 21 at 216.90 pence, giving the iron-ore and ferroalloys producer a market value of 2.79 billion
pounds, and Kazakhmys at 269.40 pence.  The founders are seeking to take ENRC off the market five
years after it sold shares in an initial offering in London.
ENRC  shares  have fallen by almost half the past year as the
company fought corruption allegations relating to operations in
Kazakhstan and  Africa .  The bidding company has until 5 p.m. London time tomorrow
to announce a firm intention for offer or say they won’t under
U.K. takeover rules. ENRC’s founders had received a three-week
extension on June 3 to make a bid for the company.  The founding shareholders and Kazakh government, together
holding almost 54 percent, sent a letter in May to an
independent committee set up by ENRC’s board detailing an offer
at 175 pence, equal to $2.65 at the time, in cash plus 0.231
shares of 26 percent-holder Kazakhmys. That was equivalent to
260 pence a share based on a 370-pence Kazakhmys price, the
committee said May 20, concluding that the offer “materially
undervalues” London-based ENRC.  To contact the reporters on this story:
