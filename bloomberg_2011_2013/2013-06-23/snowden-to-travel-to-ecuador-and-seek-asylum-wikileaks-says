Edward Snowden, the former
intelligence contractor who has been charged in the U.S. for
disclosing classified information, will travel to  Ecuador  to
seek asylum, anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks said.  Snowden “is bound for the Republic of Ecuador via a safe
route for the purposes of asylum, and is being escorted by
diplomats and legal advisers from WikiLeaks,” the group said in
a  statement  posted on its Website.  Ricardo Patino Aroca, Ecuador’s foreign minister, said in a
posting on Twitter earlier that the government of Ecuador had
received an asylum request from Snowden, who departed  Hong Kong 
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
