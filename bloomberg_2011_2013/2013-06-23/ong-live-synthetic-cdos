My, how quickly we’ve forgotten the
lessons of the financial crisis. Even though the debt markets
have once again mispriced risk -- when  junk bonds  yield a mere 5
percent, you can be sure serious trouble is brewing -- I am
referring instead to the fact that what caused the financial
crisis remains unheeded.  For instance, the  Financial Times  recently made a big deal
of how bankers at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. tried,
and failed, to put together the first synthetic collateralized
debt obligation since the onset of the 2008 crisis. The deal
fell apart because there wasn’t enough investor demand for
various tranches of the security.  Fair enough, but any deal can go bust before it’s completed
(or afterward). The implication in the Financial Times, though,
was that synthetic CDOs exacerbated the financial crisis, so the
attempted revival of the product was a bad thing.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Just because an
innovative financial product might have played a role in a
serious market disruption doesn’t mean that the product itself
is flawed. It more likely means that the rewards bankers
received for putting these deals together led them to create
more and more of them with lower and lower credit standards.  Familiar Pattern  It’s a familiar pattern of behavior on  Wall Street : A
financial innovation introduced by one firm reaps huge financial
rewards, which leads to manic efforts by competitors to offer
their own versions. That is followed by a mad rush to cash in by
flooding the market with more of that product -- and fewer
quality controls.  Think junk bonds in the 1980s, Internet stock offerings in
the 1990s and mortgage-backed securities in the 2000s. These
innovations were quantum leaps forward in the democratization of
capital -- that is, making capital available at a lower cost to
people and companies that wouldn’t otherwise have access to it.
That’s a good thing, as  Martha Stewart  would say.  The synthetic CDO was a similar, albeit more complex,
innovation, which allowed sophisticated investors to choose
precisely the amount and kind of financial risks they wanted to
take. Thanks to a lawsuit brought against Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. by the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  in April
2010, we are familiar with the most infamous synthetic CDO of
all time: Abacus 2007-AC1. In that deal, for a $15 million fee,
Goldman arranged for hedge-fund manager  John Paulson  to bet $1
billion that a bunch of mortgage-backed securities would
default. At the same time, several European banks --including
ABN Amro Bank NV (now part of Royal Bank of Scotland Plc) and
 IKB Deutsche Industriebank  AG -- made the opposite bet that the
underlying securities would keep paying the contracted rate of
high interest.  Paulson was looking for a way to short the mortgage market,
and the European banks were looking for a way to find a higher-yielding security. What’s  wrong  with an investment bank
arranging a deal to provide willing, sophisticated customers
with the risks they want to take? Nothing.  It’s only when things don’t work out that people look for
someone to blame. But in every trade, there is a winner and a
loser. When you buy a share of General Electric Co. stock --
betting that it will go up in price -- the seller hopes its
price has peaked and that there is no more upside to be had.  Abacus Deal  Sure, Paulson ended up making $1 billion on the Abacus
deal, while RBS and IKB lost about $900 million on their bad
bets. (Goldman lost the remaining $100 million because it got
stuck with some of the long side of Abacus.) But so what? This
happens all day, every day. This is the nature of markets.  As we approach the fifth anniversary of the September 2008
panic, it is worth remembering that financial innovation didn’t
cause the problem. Of course, the crisis had no single cause --
many things went wrong nearly simultaneously -- yet some
provocations rise above the others.  Chief among them was, and remains, an incentive system on
Wall Street that rewards bankers and traders who take
asynchronous risks (heads, they win; tails, you lose) with other
people’s money. When you are rewarded with a multi-million-dollar bonus for packaging shoddy mortgages into securities and
selling them to investors around the world, that’s exactly what
you are going to do until the market tells you it can no longer
be done.  Bankers and traders did just that on Wall Street in 2005
and 2006. The music stopped in the summer of 2007 when, after
the collapse of the two Bear Stearns Cos.  hedge funds  that were
chock-full of CDOs and mortgage-backed securities, the market
shut down like a power switch.  By then, Wall Street banks had billions of these unsellable
securities on their own balance sheets. Then they made another
fateful, but perhaps inevitable, mistake: They used these
increasingly risky securities as collateral for the short-term
financing they needed to run their businesses on a daily basis.  In March 2008, and again that September, the short-term
lenders decided they no longer wanted CDOs and mortgage-backed
securities as collateral for overnight loans. The Wall Street
firms -- namely, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., Morgan Stanley and American
International Group Inc. -- that had miscalculated the risks of
these securities found themselves bankrupt or almost so. As we
know, some of them were rescued and some of them weren’t.  But they all suffered from the same affliction, which had
nothing to do with financial innovation: poor risk management
and the wrong reward system. So long live the synthetic CDO. The
truth is, five years on, Wall Street still suffers from
inadequate risk management (see: Whale,  London ) and improper
incentives. Until these problems are fixed, the next financial
crisis is inevitable.  (William D. Cohan, the author of “Money and Power: How
