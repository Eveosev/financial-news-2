Ernie Els of  South Africa  scored a
final-round 69, 3-under par, to win golf’s BMW International
Open by one shot today.  Els, a four-time major winner and current British Open
champion, led throughout the tournament in Munich and finished
on 18-under, ahead of Denmark’s Thomas Bjorn.  “It’s great to get my name on this wonderful trophy,
obviously it gives you a lot of confidence,” Els told Sky
Sports. “Wire-to-wire you’ve got the pressure, every night
you’ve got to sleep on it, guys are chasing you. So this is
quite a week for me.”  Els, 43, picked up a check for 333,330 euros ($438,000)
after his 28th win on the European Tour. He’ll defend his
British Open title in this year’s event at Muirfield next month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
