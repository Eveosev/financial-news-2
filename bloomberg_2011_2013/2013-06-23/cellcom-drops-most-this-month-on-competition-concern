Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL) , Israel’s
largest mobile phone provider, fell the most in almost four
weeks, tracking declines in its New York-traded  shares (CEL)  on
growing concern price competition will erode earnings.  Shares of the Netanya, Israel-based company dropped 1.7
percent, the most since May 30, to 32.50 shekels, or the
equivalent of $8.93, at the close in  Tel Aviv . The company’s
U.S. shares posted their first weekly decrease in five, falling
3.6 percent to $8.87 on June 21.  New wireless providers, including Golan Telecom Ltd. and
Hot Telecommunication System Ltd., have spurred price discounts
that Standard & Poor’s Maalot cited in cutting the company’s
local credit rating on June 20 to the fifth-highest investment
grade. Cellcom’s net debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization surged to a record 2.91 in the
first quarter, and sales are  forecast  to plunge to the lowest
level since at least 2004 this year, according to the average
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “There have been new, progressive startups that have come
in with pricing which has undercut the large players,” Chaim Fromowitz, an executive vice president of Bank Leumi USA, said
in a telephone interview from New York. “It’s causing them a
lot of consternation.”  Cellcom’s decline last week in New York trimmed its 2013
advance to 7.1 percent. The stock tumbled 51 percent in 2012 for
the  biggest loss  among Israeli companies traded in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
