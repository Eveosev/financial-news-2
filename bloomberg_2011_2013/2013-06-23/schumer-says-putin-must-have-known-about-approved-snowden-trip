Russian President  Vladimir Putin 
must have known about and approved the travel plans of former
U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, New
York Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said on CNN’s “ State of
the Union ” program.  Snowden left Hong Kong today after the city rejected a U.S.
warrant for his arrest. Snowden is booked on a flight to the
Venezuelan capital of Caracas through Moscow and Havana,
according to an Aeroflot official who asked not to be identified
because the information is confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
