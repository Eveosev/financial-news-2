Max Scherzer became Major League
Baseballâ€™s first 11-game winner this season as the Detroit
Tigers defeated the Boston Red Sox 10-3.  Scherzer is the first pitcher to start 11-0 since  Roger Clemens  in 1997, according to Stats LLC.  He allowed two runs on six hits, including a home run by
 David Ortiz , and struck out six in seven innings last night at
Comerica Park in Detroit.  Victor Martinez  hit a grand slam to give the Tigers a 4-2
first-inning win and Omar Infante added a two-run homer in the
seventh inning.  Allen Webster (0-2) surrendered five runs on eight hits and
struck out five in 4 1/3 innings.  The Tigers (41-32) lead the American League Central, while
the Red Sox (45-32) top the AL East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
