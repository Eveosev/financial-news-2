A bus crash killed 18 Romanian
tourists and injured 29 seriously after the vehicle skidded off
a main road in Montenegro.  The bus, enroute between Montenegro’s capital Podgorica and
Kolasin, in the north region of the former Yugoslav republic,
slid off the road around 5 p.m. yesterday and crashed about 50
meters into a gorge near the Moraca river, the government said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Seven injured passengers are currently being treated in the
intensive care unit of Podgorica’s Clinical Centre, four of
which are in critical condition, according to a report by the
Podgorica Clinical Centre. The police are still investigating
the cause of the accident, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
