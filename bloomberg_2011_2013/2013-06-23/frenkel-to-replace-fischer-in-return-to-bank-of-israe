Jacob Frenkel , chairman of JPMorgan
Chase International, will return to a position he left 13 years
ago when he succeeds  Stanley Fischer  as governor of the Bank of
Israel.  Frenkel, 70, whose appointment by Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  and Finance Minister Yair Lapid was announced in a
statement today, will take over at a time when the central bank
is contending with slowing growth and surging housing prices.
His appointment must be ratified by the Cabinet.  “In Netanyahu’s mind, he thinks the fact that someone who
is internationally well known is a prerequisite, someone who can
represent Israel internationally,”  Jonathan Katz , an economist
at HSBC Holdings in Tel Aviv, said in a telephone interview.  Fischer said he would step down June 30. Frenkel served as
governor of the  Bank of Israel  from 1991 to 2000, when inflation
was close to 20 percent.  Speaking in a January interview, Frenkel said during his
time as governor before Fischer, his main challenge was to
reduce inflation.  “We had significant engines of economic growth triggered
by a very large influx of immigrants, primarily from the Soviet
Union, an extraordinary boom of the high-technology revolution
and encouraging developments in the geopolitical sphere,”
Frenkel said in January. “Now, amid very slow growth, depending
on what part of the world one looks at, the main challenge is to
secure economic growth.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
