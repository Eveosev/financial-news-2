Millionaires in Asia outside  Japan 
will create $7 trillion in net new wealth by 2016, boosting the
share of global riches from  emerging markets , according to
McKinsey & Co.  China,  India , South Korea and  Taiwan  are the leading wealth
generators in Asia, where millionaires’ personal financial
assets will surge 15 percent a year to reach $15.8 trillion from
$9 trillion at the end of 2012, McKinsey said in a survey of
private banks.  Asia, combined with fast-growing Latin America, the Middle
East,  Africa  and central and eastern Europe, will account for
about 37 percent of an estimated $80 trillion of global private
wealth by 2016, up from 24 percent at the end of 2008.  “Asia is the highest growth region for private banks and
will continue to be so,” McKinsey said. “Most private banks
are trying to broaden their product offerings to cater to the
specific needs of an Asian clientele.”  First-generation Asian millionaires will help the region
deliver more than one third of profit sources for global private
banking by 2016. The Chinese market is “open to competition as
nearly half of  China ’s high-net-worth individuals have only a
limited understanding of private banking,” according to the
survey.  International managers with offshore units in Asia won’t
reap all the benefits of the growth as more than three quarters
of wealth is booked onshore where local banks dominate. Taking
into account lower margins on offshore assets versus onshore
assets in the region, local banks will outperform international
firms, McKinsey said.  Future Growth  Future growth in personal wealth in Asia will be slightly
lower than the 16 percent annual increase from 2008 to 2012,
McKinsey said. Asia outside Japan, the third-largest wealth
market at the end of 2012 behind North America and western
Europe, will climb to second place over the next four years.  Worldwide, the number of millionaires will rise 30 percent
to 16 million by 2016, according to McKinsey. North American
millionaires’ assets will jump 7 percent a year to $27.4
trillion by 2016 from $22.6 trillion at the end of 2012.  Millionaires’ personal wealth in western Europe will climb
4 percent annually to $15.7 trillion by 2016 from $13.7 trillion
at year end 2012, while total private wealth worlwide will rise
to $80 trillion from $60 trillion, according to the report.  The shift in wealth toward developing economies and the
need to adjust to a new generation of clients combined with a
rapid increase in tax and regulatory requirements may prompt
private banks to become more selective in their geographical
focus, client mix and services and fuel industry consolidation,
McKinsey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
