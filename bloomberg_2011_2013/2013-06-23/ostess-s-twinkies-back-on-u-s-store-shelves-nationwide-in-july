Hostess Brands LLC, the bakery
company emerging from a second bankruptcy proceeding in four
years, is preparing to resume selling its iconic snack cake, the
Twinkie, nationwide in the U.S. on July 15.  The company, which filed for bankruptcy in January 2012
less than three years after emerging from a first filing, plans
to revive its complete line of snack cakes, according to Hannah
Arnold, a company spokeswoman.  Hostess is owned by  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  and  C.
Dean Metropoulos & Co. , whose combined offer of as much as $410
million for companyâ€™s snack-cake enterprise was the only one
submitted during the bankruptcy process in March. The spongy
yellow cakes went out of production, prompting bidding wars for
boxes on auction sites like EBay.  Other Hostess products include CupCakes, Ding Dongs and Ho
Hos.  Hostess, founded in 1930, liquidated its brands, recipes,
plants and other assets after failing to reach an agreement with
striking bakers on concessions to help the company emerge from
its second bankruptcy.  The company emerged from an earlier bankruptcy in 2009
under the control of the buyout firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC and
lenders. The company, previously known as Interstate Bakeries
Corp., changed its name to Hostess Brands in October of that
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
