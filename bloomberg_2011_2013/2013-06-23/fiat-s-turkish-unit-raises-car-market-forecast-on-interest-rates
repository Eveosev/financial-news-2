Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO) , a
venture between automaker  Fiat SpA (F)  and a Turkish partner, raised
its forecast for growth in the country’s car and van market this
year to 4.1 percent as lower  interest rates  fuel purchases.  Turkish vehicle sales will probably reach 600,000 cars and
210,000 vans this year, Okan Bas, Fiat’s business director for
Turkey, said June 19 in statements embargoed for release today.
That compares with 778,000 units sold in 2012, comprised of
556,000 cars and 222,000 vans, he said. Previously Tofas, which
is part owned by  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , expected a decline to 750,000.  Turkey’s passenger-car market expanded 14 percent to
323,187 units in the first five months of this year, according
to data from the Automotive Manufacturers’ Association. That
prompted Tofas to raise the forecast even as political protests
have gripped parts of Istanbul and other cities in the past
month, Bas said.  There hasn’t been “any difference” in car sale figures
between the first two weeks of June this year and the same
period in 2012, the executive said. He said it’s too early to
comment on the full impact of the protests.  Turkey ’s central bank cut the benchmark lending rate to 4.5
percent May 16, the lowest in history.  Tofas expects to sell 105,000 units this year in Turkey
with a market share of 13 percent according to the revised
forecast, Bas said. Tofas sold 102,432 units in 2012, when its
market share was 13.1 percent, according to data from Automotive
Distributors’ Association.  Renault SA (RNO) ,  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Hyundai
Motor Co. (005380)  are among manufacturers of cars, vans, trucks and
buses that sell local and imported brands in Turkey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
