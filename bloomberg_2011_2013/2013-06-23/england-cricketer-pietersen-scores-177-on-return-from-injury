England cricketer  Kevin Pietersen 
scored 177 not out for Surrey against Yorkshire today as he came
back from injury after a three-month absence.  His run haul off 188 balls helped Surrey to a total of  353-7
declared  on day three at Headingley in reply to Yorkshire’s 433-9 declared in a rain-affected County Championship match.  Pietersen has been suffering from bruising behind his right
knee. He’s seeking to be fully fit for the start of England’s
five-Test Ashes series against Australia, starting July 10 at
 Trent Bridge , Nottingham.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
