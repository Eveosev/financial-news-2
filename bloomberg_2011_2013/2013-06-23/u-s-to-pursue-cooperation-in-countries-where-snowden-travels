The U.S. will “pursue relevant law
enforcement cooperation” in any country where former
intelligence contractor Edward Snowden travels, said Nanda
Chitre, a Justice Department spokeswoman.  “We have been informed by the  Hong Kong  authorities Mr.
Snowden has departed Hong Kong for a third country,” Chitre
said today in a statement. “We will continue to discuss this
matter with Hong Kong and pursue relevant law enforcement
cooperation with other countries where Mr. Snowden may be
attempting to travel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
