Australia  captain  James Horwill  is
free to play in next weekend’s second rugby Test against the
British and Irish Lions after being found not guilty of stamping
on an opponent in the series opener in Brisbane.  Horwill, 28, faced a disciplinary hearing for allegedly
stamping or trampling on Lions lock Alun Wyn Jones in the third
minute of Australia’s 23-21 loss to the Lions yesterday.  The teams are scheduled to meet again on June 29 in
Melbourne and July 6 in Sydney.  Judicial Officer Nigel Hampton found that “on the balance
of probabilities he could not find an intentional or deliberate
action of stamping or trampling,” the Australian Rugby Union
said in a statement.  Hampton said he could not find that Horwill was acting
recklessly when his right foot came into “glancing contact”
with the Lions player’s face.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
