Audi won the 24 Hours of Le Mans
motor race, a day after the event was marred by the death of
Aston Martin Racing Team driver Allan Simonsen.  Simonsen’s fellow Dane Tom Kristensen extended his all-time
record to nine victories in the race, along with Audi teammates
Allan McNish and Loic Duval.  McNish of  Scotland  has now  won the event three times , while
it was a first victory for  France ’s Duval. It was a fourth
consecutive Le Mans win for Audi and its 12th in the past 14
years.  “The conditions have been very difficult, and it’s been
essential to take the right decisions at the right moment,”
Audi Motorsport director Wolfgang Ullrich told the  race website .
“I offer my sincere congratulations to the drivers, who haven’t
made a single error.”  Simonsen’s car crashed off the track during the fourth lap
yesterday. The 34-year-old was treated at the scene by doctors
from the Automobile Club de l’Ouest’s Medical Service before
being taken to the Circuit Medical Center, where he died, race
organizers said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
