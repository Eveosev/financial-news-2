The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 4.16 cents in the past two weeks to
$3.5969 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended June 21 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company.  The average, which reached a year-to-date peak of $3.795 in
the period ended Feb. 22, is about 12 cents above the year-earlier price of $3.478 a gallon.  “Behind this moderate drop are regional refinery issues
coming and going,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg
Survey, said in a telephone interview. “During the same period,
crude  oil prices  declined moderately, so it is crude oil
speaking as well as retail averages regionally.”  Wholesale gasoline prices at the rack have gone through a
“regional juxtaposition” over the past month, with gasoline
tumbling in the Midwest and soaring on the West Coast, Lundberg
said. Unbranded, regular gasoline at the rack in the Midwest saw
“a relentless decline” of 51 cents a gallon from June 7 to
June 21 as refiners in the region restored supplies in the
market, she said.  West Coast  Unbranded, regular gasoline at the rack on the West Coast
jumped to more than $3.20 a gallon on June 19, up from $3.022 a
gallon on June 7, after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Torrance refinery
near Los Angeles shut its crude unit, Lundberg said. Prices had
retreated to $3.0015 a gallon by June 21, she said.  “A substantial downward correction is already occurring in
the West,” Lundberg said. The U.S. should see retail prices
remain “reasonably steady or slightly decline” unless crude
prices dramatically change, she said.  In the last two-week period, refiner margins on gasoline
dropped while retail margins recovered, allowing for some relief
at the pumps, according to Lundberg. Retailers were making about
21.63 cents a gallon on June 21, an increase of about 11 cents
from June 7, she said.  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was in  Chicago , where the average
dropped 25 cents in the past two weeks to $4.23 a gallon,
Lundberg said.  The lowest price was in Tucson, where customers paid an
average of $3.24 a gallon. Regular gasoline averaged $3.73 a
gallon on  Long Island ,  New York , and $4.07 in  Los Angeles .  Nymex Gasoline  Gasoline futures  on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell
10.98 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $2.7617 a gallon in the two
weeks ended June 21.  In the Chicago spot market, conventional, 85-octane
 gasoline  sank to a 21.5-cent discount to Nymex futures June 21
from a 60-cent premium two weeks earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Exxon returned the Joliet,  Illinois ,
refinery to service following a turnaround, easing supply
constraints in the Midwest that had boosted prices through the
early part of the month.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  rose 183,000 barrels in the week
ended June 14 to 221.7 million, a nine-week high, according to
data from the Energy Information Administration, the statistical
arm of the Energy Department.  West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex fell 2.4 percent
to $93.69 a barrel in the two weeks to June 21.  Crude  inventories  rose 313,000 barrels to 394.1 barrels in
the week ended June 14.  Refinery inputs  jumped 1.9 percent to a
six-month high.  WTI prices may continue their decline this week amid a
stronger dollar and concern that the  Federal Reserve  will reduce
stimulus efforts, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Twenty-two of 34 analysts, or 65 percent, forecast crude
will decrease through June 28, the survey showed. Six
respondents, or 18 percent, predicted an increase. Six projected
no change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
