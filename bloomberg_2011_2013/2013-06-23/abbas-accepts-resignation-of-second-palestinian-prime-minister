Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas 
formally accepted the resignation of the prime minister he
installed three weeks ago to replace the Western-backed Salam Fayyad.  Rami Hamdallah, a career academic Abbas appointed June 3 to
lead the Palestinian Authority’s Cabinet, will stay in office
until a new government under his replacement is formed, the
official Wafa news agency said today by text message.  Fayyad resigned in April, warning that the unfulfilled
pledges from donor nations and spotty tax collections created a
financial mess that undermined the government’s authority. The
former International Monetary Fund economist had been trusted by
donors and bankers because of his campaign to root out
corruption and build the foundations for a Palestinian state.  Hamdallah’s resignation leaves the Palestinian government
in limbo as U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  plans to visit
Israel and the  West Bank  again later this week. Kerry invested
considerable time in discussions with Fayyad, first on
developing a plan for renewing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
and then trying unsuccessfully to persuade him not to resign.  At the same time, it is the Palestinian president, and not
the prime minister, who decides the course of negotiations.
Talks stalled, except for three weeks in 2010, more than four
years ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
