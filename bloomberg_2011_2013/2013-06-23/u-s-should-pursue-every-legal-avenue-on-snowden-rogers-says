The U.S. must take “every legal
avenue” it has to bring Edward Snowden, the former National
Security Agency contractor who disclosed information about
government surveillance programs, back to the country, House
Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said.  Snowden, 30, left  Hong Kong  after its government declined
to detain him at the request of the U.S. government. He departed
for Russia and may be headed to Venezuela, Rogers said today on
NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  “Every one of those nations is hostile to the  United
States ,” said Rogers, a Michigan Republican.  To contact the reporter on this story:
