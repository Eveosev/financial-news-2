The event level of the Calgary
Flames’ home arena has been destroyed by flood waters, according
to Ken King, president and chief executive officer of the
National Hockey League team.  Flooding reached row 8 in the Scotiabank Saddledome, King
said on the team’s Twitter site.  “It is a total loss on the event level,” King said.
“It’s very difficult to describe millions, millions gallons of
water sitting (in the Saddledome).”  Libby Raines, vice president of building operations, said
late yesterday the water was beginning to recede and that there
didn’t appear to be any structural damage.  King said plans have begun for restoration of the building.  “We are going to be ready for the start of the season,”
King said. “We’re ordering everything, including hockey
equipment, right now.”  Calgary’s downtown is closed through the early part of this
week after swollen rivers flooded parts of the city. At least
three people died in the flooding that forced the evacuation of
75,000 residents.  Calgary imposed a state of emergency and began evacuations
on June 20, according to the city’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
