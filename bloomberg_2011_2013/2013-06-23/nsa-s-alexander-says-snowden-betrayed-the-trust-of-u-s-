Edward Snowden, the former National
Security Agency contractor who disclosed details of classified
surveillance programs, “betrayed the trust and confidence we
had in him,” National Security Agency Director General Keith B. Alexander said.  “What Snowden has revealed has caused irreversible and
significant damage to our country and our allies,” Alexander
said in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.”  Snowden, 30, left  Hong Kong  today after the city rejected a
U.S. warrant for his arrest. The documents didn’t comply with
legal requirements and thus there was “no legal basis to
restrict Mr. Snowden from leaving Hong Kong,” the Hong Kong
government said in a  statement .  Alexander said the U.S. is taking actions to prevent
contractors and systems administrators from having the ability
to leak information in the future, including systems that will
track administrators and the changing of passwords.  “Clearly the system did not work as it should have,”
Alexander said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
