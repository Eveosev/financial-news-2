Canada recorded its 11th straight
 merchandise trade  deficit in February, the longest streak in at
least 25 years, with the shortfall unexpectedly widening as
exports of metals declined.  The deficit of C$1.02 billion ($1.00 billion) followed a
January figure that was revised to C$746 million from C$237
million, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the string would end with a C$100
million surplus, based on the median of 21 forecasts.  The  Bank of Canada  softened its language about raising
 interest rates  on March 6, citing slower inflation and curbs on
exports that include a strong currency and “fiscal drag” in
the U.S. Exports won’t recover from a recession that ended in
2009 until the second half of next year, according to the
central bank.  Exports fell 0.6 percent to C$38.5 billion in February, as
shipments of metal and non-metallic minerals dropped 7 percent
to C$4.69 billion.  Imports rose 0.1 percent to C$39.5 billion,  Statistics
Canada  said.  The volume of exports declined 0.6 percent and import
volumes fell 0.4 percent, Statistics Canada said. Volume figures
adjust for price changes and can be a better indicator of how
trade contributes to economic growth.  The  surplus with the U.S.  narrowed to C$3.40 billion in
February from C$3.90 billion a month earlier. Exports make up
about one-third of Canada’s economy, with about 75 percent of
 the shipments  going to the U.S.  The 11 consecutive trade deficits is the longest streak in
Statistics Canada records that date from 1988, surpassing a
series of 10 deficits in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
