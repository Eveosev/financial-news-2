Radware Ltd. (RDWR) , an Israeli maker of
technology that helps networks run efficiently, sank the most
since 2004 in  New York  after profit trailed forecasts as sales
in China and the European, Middle East and Africa region slowed.  Shares of Radware, based in  Tel Aviv , plunged 23 percent to
$29.07 in New York, the lowest close since July. Trading volumes
were more than 20 times the daily average over the past three
months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Radware posted the
biggest drop on the  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the
largest Israeli companies traded in the U.S., which slid 0.8
percent.  First-quarter adjusted earnings dropped to 30 cents a share
from 39 cents a year earlier, or at least 10 cents lower than
Radware’s projection, the company said in a preliminary
statement today. On average, analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated profit of 43 cents. Sales of $45 million also trailed
both the company’s forecast and analysts’ estimates.  “Clearly there’s disappointment,” Alex Henderson, an
analyst at Needham & Co. in New York who rates Radware a buy,
said by phone. “Their problem is very much in Europe and China.
This was really existing customers that simply are taking longer
to put orders on projects that are ongoing.”  Radware was worst performer in the Nasdaq
Telecommunications Index today. Competitor  F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV) 
slumped 19 percent after reporting preliminary quarterly profit
and revenue that missed its forecast as North American sales
slowed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
