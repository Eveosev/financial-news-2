U.K. government bonds rose, with 10-
year yields falling to the lowest since September, as a U.S.
report showing employers added fewer jobs than economists
forecast boosted demand for Britain’s fixed-income assets.  The pound rose to a six-week high against the dollar after
the U.S. Labor Department report added to signs growth in the
world’s biggest economy is slowing.  Benchmark gilts  headed for a
fourth weekly gain, the longest run since November, amid concern
financial turmoil in Cyprus and a political stalemate in  Italy 
will re-ignite  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “There are still risks out there and investors are still
interested in safe-haven trades,” said  Peter Dixon , an
economist at Commerzbank AG in  London . “Cyprus has had a big
impact on the markets. Gilts seem massively overvalued.”  The  10-year gilt  yield fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.63 percent at 4:34 p.m. London time, the
lowest since Sept. 5. The 1.75 percent bond due in September
2022 rose 0.72, or 7.20 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
101.04. The yield has declined 14 basis points this week.  U.S. employers added 88,000 workers in March, the least in
nine months, after a revised 268,000 gain in February, the Labor
Department said. The median forecast of 87 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was for 190,000. The jobless rate fell to 7.6
percent from 7.7 percent.  Pound Gains  The pound appreciated for a third day against the greenback
as investors bet the U.S. payroll data means the  Federal Reserve 
will maintain its policy of asset purchases to push down
borrowing costs.  Sterling gained 0.7 percent to $1.5343 after rising to
$1.5363, the strongest level since Feb. 20. The U.K. currency
was little changed at 84.93 pence per euro.  The  Bank of England  yesterday maintained its asset-purchase
 target  at 375 billion pounds and kept its benchmark interest
 rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent.  The pound has still weakened 4.1 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar has gained 2.3
percent and the euro rose 0.9 percent.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , Europe’s second-largest discount carrier, said
that the depreciating pound is affecting its earnings. The
company, which today announced a pretax loss for the six months
ended March in the range of 60 million pounds to 65 million
pounds, said a weaker pound had an “adverse impact” of 30
million pounds to 35 million pounds in the period.  Gilts returned 1.4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
0.7 percent and Treasuries rose 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
