German stocks  declined as investors
awaited a monthly report on American payrolls to gauge the
strength of the world’s biggest economy.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  slumped to its lowest price in two
months amid concern the outbreak of a new strain of bird flu in
China will hurt  travel demand . EON SE and  RWE AG (RWE)  climbed at
least 1 percent as a gauge of utilities companies rose the most
among the 19 industry groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   The DAX lost 0.2 percent to 7,800.06 at 9:51 a.m. in
Frankfurt, heading for a weekly gain of 0.1 percent. The equity
benchmark has still advanced 2.5 percent this year amid
speculation that central banks will maintain their stimulus
measures. The broader HDAX Index lost 0.3 percent today.  “There is a lot of noise around the payroll figures,”
Peter Garnry, an equity strategist at Saxo Bank A/S in
Copenhagen, wrote in an e-mail. “We are close to all-time highs
in the  DAX (DAX)  and the stock market has discounted an improvement in
global economic activity. Investors need the hard data to come
in to fuel this rally.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the DAX
was 36 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Today’s non-farm payrolls report may show U.S. employers
hired a net 190,000 workers last month and the unemployment rate
held at a four-year low of 7.7 percent as demand improved at the
start of the year, according to the median economist forecast in
a Bloomberg survey. That compares with an increase of 236,000 in
February.  Bird Flu  Lufthansa,  Europe ’s second-largest airline, slid 4.1
percent to 14.31 euros. The death toll from a new strain of bird
flu in China, known as H7N9, rose to six people as authorities
in Shanghai shut several poultry markets and culled birds.  EON and RWE, Germany’s two biggest utility companies,
advanced 1.1 percent to 14.21 euros, and 1.1 percent to 29.32
euros, respectively.  Munich Re , the world’s largest reinsurer, added 2.9 percent
to 153.30 euros. HSBC Holdings Plc upgraded the stock to
overweight from underweight, citing the likelihood of a 10
billion euro cash-return program, including dividends, over the
next three years, and strong performances in the company’s
property, and casualty and life operations this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
