Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , the
operator of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, said a cooling system
for one of its spent fuel pools at the crippled nuclear station
stopped today.  Tepco, as the company is known, expects the cooling system
to resume operating by the end of today, it said in an e-mailed
statement. It would take about two weeks for the pool to reach
65 degrees Celsius (149 degrees Fahrenheit), the regulatory
safety limit, from the 15.1 degrees Celsius recorded at 2 p.m.,
it said.  The earthquake and tsunami of March 2011 caused three
meltdowns and a massive release of radiation at the Fukushima
plant, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate and leaving
neighboring areas uninhabitable for decades. Last month, a rat
caused a blackout at the plant, highlighting the vulnerability
of its power and cooling systems more than a year after the
government said its damaged reactors had been brought into a
stable state, known as cold shutdown.  The cooling system for the spent fuel pool at the No. 3
reactor was found to have stopped after a power supply alarm
went off at 2:27 p.m. today, Tepco said. The utility is
investigating the cause, it said.  The utility concluded last week that the rat had short-
circuited a switchboard at the plant, causing a power outage at
four pools used to cool spent nuclear fuel rods. Power was
mostly restored the next day before the spent fuel rods started
overheating and releasing radiation, according to Tepco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
