Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) 
climbed the most in more than four years in  Tokyo  trading,
leading gains among Japanese lenders after the central bank
announced its biggest round of quantitative easing.  The country’s second-biggest bank by market value jumped as
much as 16 percent, the biggest intraday gain since October
2008, before trading 6.3 percent higher at 4,210 yen as of 9:53
a.m. in Tokyo.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s
largest publicly traded bank, rose 5.2 percent and  Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. (8411)  gained 3.4 percent.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  surpassed 13,000 for the first
time since August 2008, a day after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  said it
will double the monetary base by the end of 2014 to end more
than a decade of  deflation . Ten-year government bond  yields 
tumbled to a record low, boosting the value of banks’ 164
trillion yen ($1.7 trillion) in holdings of sovereign debt.  “Expectations for inflation under the BOJ’s new policy
would have a positive effect on bank lending,” said Shinichiro Nakamura, a Tokyo-based analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.
“Monetary easing drives long-term interest rates lower and
that’s good news for the banks’ bond trading profit.”  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s fourth-biggest
bank by market value, surged 16 percent. Shinsei Bank Ltd.
advanced 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
