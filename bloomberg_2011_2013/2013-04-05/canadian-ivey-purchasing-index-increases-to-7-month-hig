Canada’s Ivey purchasing managers’
index  rose  to the highest in seven months, exceeding economist
projections, as measures including inventories and employment
showed expansion.  The index rose to 61.6 on a seasonally adjusted basis, the
highest since August and up from 51.1 in February, according to
a statement on the website of Western University’s business
school. Readings of more than 50 indicate an increase in
purchasing by governments and companies. The reading exceeded
the most optimistic  forecast  of 14 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The data contrasts with jobs and trade figures released
today that suggest the world’s 11th largest economy is slowing.
Employment dropped by 54,500 positions in February, the biggest
decline since the last recession four years ago, while the
merchandise trade deficit persisted for an 11th straight month.  Among related indexes, the employment figure declined to
53.1 from 55.8, while the inventories index rose to 52.9 from
43.6. The supplier delivery measure fell to 51.3 from 52.2, and
the price index dropped to 53.5 from 58.8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
