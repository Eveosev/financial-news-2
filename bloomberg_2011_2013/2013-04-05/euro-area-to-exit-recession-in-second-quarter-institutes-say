The 17-nation euro economy will exit
its recession in the second quarter as exports to the U.S. and
 emerging markets  pick up, research institutes in Germany, France
and  Italy  predict.  The economy will grow 0.1 percent in the second quarter and
0.2 percent in the third after stagnating in the first three
months of the year, the Ifo, Insee and Istat institutes said
today in a joint report.  “Demand from emerging markets will expand at an increasing
pace, reflecting monetary and fiscal easing,” and “growth in
the  United States  is also expected to be buoyant and support
euro-zone exports,” the institutes said. Private consumption
will stabilize in the second and third quarters “as a result of
a decline in inflation and more gradual fiscal consolidation
despite the persistent increase in unemployment,” they said.  The institutes forecast that inflation will slow from 1.8
percent in the first quarter to 1.6 percent in the second and
1.5 percent in the third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
