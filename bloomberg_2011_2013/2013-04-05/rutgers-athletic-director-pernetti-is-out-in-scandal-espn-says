Tim Pernetti is out as athletic
director at  Rutgers University  in the aftermath of a scandal
involving fired basketball coach Mike Rice, ESPN reported.  The Walt Disney Co. unit didn’t say whether Pernetti had
been fired or resigned. It said its story was based on
information from an unidentified person.  Jason Baum, a Rutgers athletic department spokesman,
declined to comment on Pernetti’s status in a telephone
interview. University spokesman Greg Trevor didn’t immediately
return a message left at his office.  Rice was fired this week after ESPN aired video of him
physically and verbally abusing players during practice.
Pernetti had suspended Rice for three games and fined him
$50,000 in December after viewing some of the same footage.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
