Tottenham midfielder Gareth Bale
will be out for two weeks after spraining ligaments in his ankle
in last night’s Europa League match against Basel.  Bale, defender  William Gallas  and midfielder Aaron Lennon
underwent scans today after leaving the 2-2 draw with injuries.
All three are expected to resume training in two weeks,
Tottenham said on its website.  Bale, who’s scored 22 goals this season, was carried off
the field on a stretcher after rolling his ankle while
challenging for a ball late in the match. Gallas has a strained
calf and Lennon has a bruise below his knee, Spurs said.  Tottenham is third in the Premier League with 57 points,
two more than Chelsea and four ahead of Arsenal as the teams
battle for the final two qualifying places in the  Champions
League .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
