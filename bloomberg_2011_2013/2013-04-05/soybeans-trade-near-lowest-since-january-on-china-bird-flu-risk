Soybeans traded near the lowest
since January as the death toll from a new strain of bird flu in
 China  rose, boosting concerns poultry meat consumption and feed
use in the world’s largest buyer of the oilseed may slow.  The May contract dropped 0.7 percent to $13.625 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade at 10:45 a.m. Singapore time on
volume that was 6 percent below the 100-day average for that
time of day. Futures fell yesterday to $13.61, the lowest since
Jan. 11, and are heading for a 3 percent loss this week.  Officials in  Shanghai  closed a live-poultry trading area
and began culling birds there after the H7N9 virus was detected
in pigeon samples, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported
yesterday, without citing the origin of the information. The
death toll from the new birdflu strain reached six in China, the
Washington Post reported, citing the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.  “These fears contributed to the weaker price action,”
 Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia  wrote in a report today. “Unless the virus becomes
much more widespread, we think these fears are overdone.”  The May contract for corn, which can be used in poultry
feed, was little changed at $6.2975 a bushel, set for a 9.4
percent loss this week, the most since the five days ended June
15. Wheat was little changed at $6.94 a bushel.  Total sales of wheat fell 62 percent to 315,984 metric tons
in the week to March 28, the  smallest  since Jan. 31, according
to U.S. Department of Agriculture data released yesterday.
Futures fell 3.7 percent in March, extending an 8.3 percent
plunge the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
