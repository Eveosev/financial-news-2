Chevron Corp. (CVX)  replaced pipe at El
Segundo refinery’s No. 4 crude unit in early September, Melissa Ritchie, Co. spokeswoman, said by e-mail.
* Co. collected inspection data on portions of piping at the
crude unit in Aug., determined that thickness of pipe would
allow it to remain in service
* Pipe was later replaced “out of an abundance of caution in
light of the Richmond incident,” Ritchie says
* Inspection of piping at refinery is “ongoing,” she says
