Peru’s sol-denominated bonds rose,
pushing yields to the lowest in a month, on speculation the
Federal Reserve will maintain stimulus to shore up the world’s
biggest economy, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent bond due
August 2020 fell one basis points, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.76 percent at 1:50 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the lowest since March 5. The price rose 0.04
centimo to 125.81 centimos per sol.  U.S. payrolls grew by 88,000 workers last month, the least
in nine months, adding to speculation the economy is slowing.
The U.S. central bank has been buying $85 billion of bonds each
month since the start of the year in an effort to hold down
borrowing costs and encourage economic growth.  “Portfolio managers think the second quarter will be
disappointing,” said Diego Alvarez, a bond trader at  Banco
Internacional del Peru SAA (INTERBC1)  in Lima.  Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said yesterday the
central bank would double its monthly asset purchases in a bid
to stoke inflation. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
said the ECB stands ready to cut interest rates and consider
additional measures to boost growth.  Japan’s stimulus pledge “has given a good boost to fixed
income globally,” Alvarez said.  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5820 per U.S. dollar
at today’s close, according to prices from Datatec. The central
bank bought $40 million of U.S. currency, the most in a week,
and said on its website it paid an average 2.5824 soles per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
