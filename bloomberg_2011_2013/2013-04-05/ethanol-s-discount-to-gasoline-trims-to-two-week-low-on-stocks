Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed to the lowest level in more than two weeks after the
biggest quarterly supply decline on record.  The spread, or price difference, contracted 2.91 cents to
44.66 cents a gallon, the least since March 19, two days after
the Energy Information Administration reported the first dip in
 inventories  for January-March in records going back to 2010. EIA
data also showed a year-to-date  production  rate of 12.2 billion
gallons annually, 12 percent lower than the 13.8 billion the
U.S. is required to use this year.  “You’re drawing inventory way too fast at the wrong time
of year,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in
Chicago. “Part of it is discipline on the production side.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery slipped 0.6 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $2.417 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have gained 10 percent this year.  Gasoline futures for May delivery fell 3.51 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.8636 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Kitt said ethanol stockpiles typically gain during the
first quarter of the year, before higher demand from the summer
driving season that starts on the U.S. Memorial Day weekend at
the end of May.  Production has plunged 16 percent to 807,000 barrels a day
as of last week from a record 963,000 barrels in December 2011,
data from the Energy Department’s statistical arm show.  Corn Yields  Drought in the Midwest last year battered corn yields and
sent prices for the grain to a record in August, eroding returns
to turn a bushel of corn into the biofuel.  Prices for the grain have eased 14 percent since a March 28
Agriculture Department report showed domestic corn inventories
on March 1 totaled 5.399 billion bushels, exceeding analysts’
estimates of 4.995 billion.  Corn for May delivery decreased 1 cent to $6.29 a bushel in
Chicago, the lowest level since June. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was 13
cents a gallon, unchanged from yesterday. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Kitt said ethanol prices are benefiting from lower imports
from Brazil, the biggest seller of the fuel to the U.S., where
the sugarcane harvest is under way. Sugarcane is the primary
feedstock for Brazilian ethanol, compared with corn in the U.S.  “Ethanol has its own story aside from corn,” Kitt said.  Ethanol Imports  Imports of the biofuel averaged 49,000 barrels a day last
week, down 60 percent from the record 122,000 barrels a day in
October, EIA data show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 92 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, the least since Feb. 22, EIA said, and up
from 91 percent a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.535 a gallon; in New York the biofuel jumped 3.5
cents to $2.625; in Chicago the additive slipped 0.5 cent to
$2.475; and on the West Coast, the most expensive trading locale
in the nation, it gained 1 cent to $2.685 a gallon, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf widened 1
cent to 15 cents from the lowest level in four weeks, while
Chicago’s discount to New York widened 4 cents to 15 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
