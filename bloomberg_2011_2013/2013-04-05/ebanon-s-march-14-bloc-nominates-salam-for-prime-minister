Lebanon’s March 14 alliance named a
son of a veteran politician as its choice for premier to replace
 Najib Mikati , who resigned last month, the group said in an e-
mailed statement.  March 14 lawmakers will inform President Michel Suleiman of
their decision to name lawmaker Tammam Salam for the post during
Parliamentary consultations the president will hold today and
tomorrow.  The rival March 8 bloc, dominated by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, has decided after long deliberations to back Salam,
the Daily Star newspaper reported, citing unidentified political
sources.  Salam, a U.K.-educated businessman, is the son of late
Premier Saeb Salam and has served as culture minister.  Mikati, a Hezbollah-backed billionaire, dissolved his two-
year-old administration on March 23 amid disagreements between
March 14 and March 8 groups over the rules that should govern
June’s Parliamentary elections and the reappointment of a
security chief.  To contact the reporter on this story:
