ING U.S. Inc., an insurance unit of
the largest Dutch financial-services company, expects to get
gross proceeds of about $600 million from a planned U.S. initial
public offering.  Parent  ING Groep NV (INGA)  will also sell stock in the offering,
according to a regulatory filing today. The filing didnâ€™t
specify how much in proceeds the parent expects. ING filed for
the IPO in November using a $100 million placeholder amount.  ING Groep was ordered by the European Union to sell
insurance operations, its U.S. online bank and a Dutch mortgage
lender before the end of this year as a condition for approval
of a 2008 bailout. The U.S. unit, led by ex-American
International Group Inc. executive Rodney Martin, competes with
 MetLife Inc. (MET)  and Prudential Financial Inc. selling savings
products as workers rely less on their employers for pensions.  ING U.S. also said it may issue about $1.1 billion in debt
after the IPO is completed, consisting of $700 million long-term
junior subordinated debt securities and $400 million in senior
unsecured notes.  The U.S. unit has about 13 million customers and offers
savings products and annuities in addition to  life insurance ,
according to the filing. Revenue fell 1.1 percent to $9.62
billion last year.  Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc.
are leading the sale.  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  is among the
underwriters added in the latest filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
