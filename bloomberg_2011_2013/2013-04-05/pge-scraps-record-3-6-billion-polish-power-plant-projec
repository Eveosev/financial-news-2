PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s biggest utility,
canceled a record 11.6 billion zloty ($3.6 billion) hard coal-
fired power plant project as electricity prices slumped and the
economy faces its worst slowdown in more than a decade.  State-controlled PGE signed a preliminary agreement with
 Rafako SA (RFK) ,  Polimex-Mostostal SA (PXM)  and  Mostostal Warszawa SA (MSW)  early
last year to build the 1,800-megawatt plant in Opole, Poland.
The start of the construction was delayed by protests by
environmental groups.  PGE, whose profit fell 34 percent in 2012, is reviewing
investment projects as the slowing economy pushed electricity
prices down 16 percent last year, the most among any country in
the European Union, while power demand fell for the first time
in three years, according to the country’s transmission grid.  The prices declined further 8.9 percent this year, Polish
output from more expensive hard coal-fired plants declined 7
percent in 2012, while lignite-fired units produced 3.7 percent
of energy more, according to the national grid operator.  The company needs to adjust its expansion to changing
market conditions and “better use of capital,” it said on
March 14, adding that its lignite-fired  power plants  are “best
positioned” to keep higher profitability.  PGE shares  jumped  as much as 3.2 percent to 17.02 zloty,
climbing the most since March 27, and traded 0.9 percent higher
at 16.64 zloty as of 3 p.m. in Warsaw. The stock has lost 8.7
percent this year to value the company at 31.1 billion zloty.  To contact the reporters on this story:
