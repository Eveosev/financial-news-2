Index of 24  raw materials  fell 0.7 percent to 628.26. The UBS
Bloomberg CMCI  gauge  of 26 prices slid 0.1 percent to 1,501.294.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures in  New York  surged the most in four
months, settling at a 20-month high, as cold weather helped
erase a stockpile surplus and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised
its 2013 gas price forecast.  Gas jumped 4.5 percent, the biggest one-day gain since Dec.
5, as MDA Weather Services predicted below-normal temperatures
in north-central states next week while  Texas  and the Southeast
will see hotter-than-normal readings April 15-19. Unusually cold
March weather  pushed supplies  below the five-year average for
the first time since 2011, and prompted Goldman Sachs to
increased its price outlook by 17 percent.  Natural gas for May delivery rose 17.8 cents to $4.125 per
million Btu on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest

concern that dry weather and a fruit disease will worsen crop
losses in  Florida , the world’s second-largest grower. Coffee
also rose, while sugar, cocoa and cotton slid.  Orange juice for delivery in May jumped 4.9 percent to
