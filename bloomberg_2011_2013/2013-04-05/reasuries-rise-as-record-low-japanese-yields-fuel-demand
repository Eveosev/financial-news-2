Treasuries rose, pushing yields
toward the lowest level this year, as tumbling Japanese bond
rates and a sliding yen enhanced demand for  U.S. debt .  Japan’s 10-year rate fell to a record 0.315 percent, and
the yen weakened to 97.06 against the dollar, a level not seen
since August 2009.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
yesterday doubled the BOJ’s bond purchases to 7 trillion yen a
month ($72.3 billion) as he seeks to fight deflation.  “Kuroda-san changed everything,” said Genzo Kimura, who
helps oversee the equivalent of $43.4 billion as a bond investor
in Tokyo at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co. The yield
on Japanese  government bonds  is “so low, it’s not attractive. I
bought Treasuries this week,” he said.  Benchmark U.S. 10-year  yields  declined one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.75 percent at 10:21 a.m. in  Tokyo ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The rate is two basis
points away from the lowest level this year.  The price of the 2 percent note maturing in February 2023
rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 102 7/32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
