Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s
Japan unit faces penalties after the country’s securities
watchdog found that employees attempted to manipulate benchmark
 interest rates .  The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission asked
the Financial Services Agency to take “administrative action”
against RBS Securities Japan Ltd., the watchdog said in a
 statement  in Tokyo today.  The recommendation comes two months after RBS’s Japan unit
agreed to plead guilty to  wire fraud  as part of the Edinburgh-
based bank’s $612 million settlement with U.K. and U.S.
authorities for rigging the London interbank offered rate.  From around mid-2006 to early 2010, an RBS Securities
trader and his colleagues asked employees responsible for making
yen Libor submissions to change them to favor their derivatives
transactions, the commission said. The conduct was “seriously
unjust and malicious,” it said.  In a separate violation, the SESC said RBS Securities’
chief executive officer and chief operating officer received
non-public customer information on bank branches of RBS and ABN
Amro Bank NV from May 2008 to February 2010. The branches were
consolidated in June 2009 as part of a takeover, it said.  RBS apologized to customers today, saying in a statement
that it will take appropriate steps to address the issues
raised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
