Prada SpA (1913) , an Italian maker of
$1,150 studded leather slippers, said it remains confident of
succeeding in a challenging economic climate after a policy of
cutting discounts helped profit beat analyst predictions.  Net income in the 12 months ended Jan. 31 rose 45 percent
to 625.7 million euros ($811 million) from 431.9 million euros a
year earlier, Milan-based Prada said today in a statement.
Analysts expected profit of 618 million euros, according to the
average of 29  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Fourth-quarter
profit gained 37 percent to 217 million euros.  Prada limited markdowns in the final quarter of the fiscal
year as same-store sales growth decelerated from the previous
three months, mainly because of the later timing of the Chinese
New Year in 2013. The full-price policy and new stores helped
support margins, with earnings before interest and tax widening
to 27 percent of sales from 24.6 percent a year earlier.  “The group remains confident that the strategy which has
been coherently deployed in recent years with regard to brand
positioning and retail expansion will again be a key success
factor for the forthcoming fiscal year, even in a general
economic environment that remains challenging,” Prada said. The
number of directly operated stores as of Jan. 31 rose 19 percent
from a year earlier to 461 outlets.  Stock Performance  The earnings were released after the close of trading in
 Hong Kong , where the company’s stock is listed. Prada shares
fell 1.5 percent to HK$77.10 today, giving the owner of brands
including Church’s and Car Shoe a market value of HK$197.3
billion ($25.4 billion).  “Prada represents a structural-growth story, supported by
a strong store opening plan and compelling like-for-like growth,
with substantial margin upside potential across both flagship
brands, Prada and Miu Miu,” Allegra Perry, an analyst at  Cantor
Fitzgerald  who recommends buying Prada shares, wrote in a report
last week. “We see a significant opportunity in  Asia  where the
group is under-penetrated.”  Prada proposed a dividend of 9 euro cents a share, almost
double the year-earlier payout of 5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
