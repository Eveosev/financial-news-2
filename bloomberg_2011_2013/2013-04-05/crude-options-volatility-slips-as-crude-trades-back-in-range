Crude options volatility slipped,
from a four-week high as futures dropped back into a trading
range they had broken out of on March 25.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 19.66 percent at 2:45 p.m. on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Volatility yesterday reached 20.22
percent, the highest level since March 6. Volatility for options
expiring in June sank to 19.65 percent from 20.51 percent
yesterday.  “We had really heavy volume and we saw a pop in volatility
with a lot more puts traded than calls,” said Jim Colburn, a
vice president and energy options broker at Jefferies Bache LLC
in New York. “You’re seeing a little pause in the move as you
flushed a lot of short-option players out and crude trading back
into the trading range.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery fell 55
cents to settle at $92.70 a barrel on the Nymex. From Feb. 25 to
March 22, May futures traded between $89.78 and $94.90 before
rising the next five days to an intraday high of $97.80. Prices
have fallen three consecutive days.  Puts protecting against a 10 percent drop in futures were
trading at 27.7 percent volatility, compared with 22.7 percent
for calls betting on a 10 percent rise in prices. The skew was
less than 1 percent a week ago.  Most-Active  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $90 puts, which slipped 4 cents to $1.31 a barrel on volume
of 3,147 contracts at 2:56 p.m. May $90 puts were the second-
