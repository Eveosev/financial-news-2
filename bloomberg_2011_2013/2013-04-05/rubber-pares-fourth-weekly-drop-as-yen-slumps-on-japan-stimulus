Rubber recovered from a four-month
low as the yen slumped to its weakest level since August 2009 on
expanded stimulus by the Bank of  Japan , boosting the appeal of
yen-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in September climbed as much as
2.2 percent to 264.5 yen a kilogram ($2,730 a metric ton) before
trading at 259.7 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 11:29
a.m. Futures closed at the lowest since Nov. 29 yesterday and
have declined 5.2 percent this week, a fourth weekly decline.  The yen slid against all 16 most-traded peers this week and
traded at 97.17 per dollar after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda
yesterday exceeded analysts’ estimates in announcing stimulus
measures that aim to spur annual inflation to 2 percent in two
years. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed above 13,000 for
the first time since August 2008, led by exporters such as
Toyota Motor Corp.  “The yen’s slump is the largest support to rubber,”
Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp. in
 Tokyo , said by phone today. “A weak yen is likely to expand
overseas sales of Japanese carmakers, a positive factor for
rubber demand.”  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 1.2 percent to 82.75 baht
($2.82) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . That was the lowest level since November
2009, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Financial markets in  China  are closed for a national
holiday. Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell for the first time in nine weeks by 192 tons to 117,504
tons, the bourse said April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
