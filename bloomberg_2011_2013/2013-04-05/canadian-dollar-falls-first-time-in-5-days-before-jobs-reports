The Canadian dollar fell for the
first time in five days against its U.S. counterpart before jobs
reports in the U.S. and Canada forecast to show employment
growth slowed last month  The currency fell against the majority of its most traded
peers before figures projected to show the Canadian economy
created 6,500 new jobs in March after adding 50,700 the previous
month, according to the median estimate of a Bloomberg survey of
24 economists. The U.S. added 190,000 jobs in March, down from
236,000 the month before, a separate survey of 87 economists
shows.  “If dollar/Canada continues to trade higher then I would
guess the Canadian employment number might be a soft number,
just based on what’s happened in the last three or four months
in how the currency’s moved as far as these tier-one data
releases, ” said David Bradley, director of foreign exchange
trading at Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital Inc., by phone
from Toronto.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 0.1 percent to
C$1.0133 per U.S. dollar at 7:37 a.m. in Toronto. The loonie
touched C$1.0105 per U.S. dollar yesterday, its highest point
since Feb. 19. One Canadian dollar buys 98.66 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
