Former South African President
Nelson Mandela, who’s been hospitalized for more than a week to
receive treatment for pneumonia, is “getting better and
better,” his wife Graca Machel said.  “The doctors want to be absolutely sure he’s strong enough
to go home and nothing is going to recur,” Machel said
yesterday in comments broadcast by Johannesburg-based eNCA.
“Madiba is fine,” she said, referring to Mandela by his clan
name.  Mandela, 94, was admitted to an undisclosed hospital in
 Pretoria  on March 27, less than three weeks after he stayed
overnight for a check-up. South Africa’s first black president,
who spent 27 years in prison for opposing the government under
white minority rule, had fluid drained from his lungs at the
weekend.  “He is improving continuously,” Mac Maharaj, a spokesman
for President Jacob Zuma, said in a phone interview today.
“Doctor’s haven’t indicated when he might be able to go home.
The doctors prefer to err on the side of caution.”  Mandela led South Africa for five years after the African
National Congress won the first all-race elections in 1994 that
marked the end of apartheid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
