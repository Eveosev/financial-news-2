The rupee headed for the biggest
weekly drop in a month after data showed India’s current-account
 deficit  widened to a record while capital inflows slowed.  The government will act to tackle the shortfall and to spur
foreign investment, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said April 3.
The  gap  in the broadest measure of trade was $32.6 billion in
the quarter through December, a central bank report showed March
28. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, one of nine partners in Singh’s
ruling alliance, withdrew support to the administration last
month over its approach to alleged  war crimes  in  Sri Lanka .  “The rupee will depreciate because the current-account
deficit story is pretty negative,” said Vivek Rajpal, a Mumbai-
based strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “Political uncertainty
and growth worries mean portfolio inflows are also slowing.”  The rupee lost 1 percent this week, the most since the five
days ended March 1, to 54.8225 per dollar as of 9:19 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It rose 0.1
percent today, after touching 54.8975 yesterday, the lowest
level since March 7. Nomura predicts the currency will drop to
59 by the end of 2013.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, from a week ago to
7.98 percent. The measure jumped 15 basis points today.  Slower Inflows  Global funds  boosted  holdings of Indian stocks by $1.9
billion in March, exchange data show, after adding more than $4
billion in each of the previous three months.  The economy probably expanded 5 percent in the year ended
March 31, which would be the least since 2003, the  Central
Statistical Office  predicted in February.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.88 per
dollar, compared with 55.53 at the end of last week, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable
contracts were at 55.91 versus 55.53. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  India ’s benchmark bonds due in 2022 were little changed
this week and today before the government starts its record 6.29
trillion rupee ($115 billion) borrowing program for the fiscal
year that began April 1. The  finance ministry  will offer 150
billion rupees of notes due 2020, 2026, 2032 and 2042 today,
according to a central bank statement.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 was at
7.96 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate touched a three-month high of 7.99 percent on
April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
