Lincoln National Corp. (LNC)  was among
U.S. life insurers that declined as bond yields fell after
employers added fewer jobs than forecast.  Lincoln dropped 1.7 percent to $30.87 at 4 p.m. in  New
York .  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life insurer, slipped 2.2
percent and No. 2  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  lost 2.6 percent.  Low yields pressure investment income at life and health
insurers, which hold more than $2 trillion in bonds to help back
obligations on policies. Yields on 10-year Treasuries fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.70 percent, after
the unemployment report fueled speculation the world’s biggest
economy is slowing.  “Sustained low  interest rates  present a challenge for life
insurers because of reduced reinvestment rates,”  Jay Gelb , an
analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a note to investors on April 2.
Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Lincoln,  Hartford Financial Services
Group Inc. (HIG)  and  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  are the large
life insurers “most exposed,” he said.  Hartford dropped 2.6 percent and Aflac dropped 3.9 percent.
New York-based AIG climbed 2.5 percent.  U.S. payrolls grew by 88,000 workers, the smallest gain in
nine months and less than the most-pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg survey, Labor Department data showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
