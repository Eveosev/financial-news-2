China  is on track to become  Russia ’s
biggest crude oil export market within five years after OAO
Rosneft, the world’s biggest publicly traded oil producer,
agreed to more than double shipments in exchange for loans.  Rosneft said it will deliver at least 37 million metric
tons of oil a year, or about 743,000 barrels a day, to China
National Petroleum Corp. starting from 2018, according to a copy
of the agreement obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Rosneft and CNPC signed the agreement when Chinese
President Xi Jinping came to Moscow last month on his first
state visit abroad. Xi and Russian President  Vladimir Putin  are
expanding energy cooperation and strengthening ties to counter
U.S. influence around the world.  “This is a prime example of Russia’s commitment to
China,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , a London-based analyst at VTB
Capital, said by phone today. “Russia is looking to where the
money and the market is.”  Germany  was the biggest market for Russian crude in 2011,
buying about 700,000 barrels a day, while China was fourth with
less than 400,000 barrels a day,  according  to the U.S. Energy
Information Agency.  Rosneft agreed to borrow $2 billion from China Development
Bank Corp., backed by 25 years of oil supplies, under accords
signed March 22 in the Kremlin. The company will also get
advance payments for part of the deliveries. That echoes a 2009
deal in which Rosneft borrowed $15 billion from China and OAO
Transneft, the Russian oil pipeline operator, got $10 billion as
part of contract for an initial 15 million tons of oil a year to
the Asian nation.  China Spur  Rosneft agreed to increase oil flows to China through a
spur from the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline by as much as
800,000 tons this year from an earlier planned 15 million tons.  The state-owned Russian producer may boost total supplies
from the Skovorodino-Mohe spur to 17 million tons next year and
20 million tons a year from 2015 to 2017, according to the
agreement. Supplies along that route may reach an annual 30
million tons for the 20 years from 2018.  The deal also calls for exports via other unspecified
routes of 7 million to 10 million tons a year for 10 years,
starting in 2014.  Separately, Rosneft may supply 9.1 million tons a year for
the planned Tianjin refinery, a joint venture in which CNPC will
hold 51 percent, according to the document.  To contact the reporters on this story:
