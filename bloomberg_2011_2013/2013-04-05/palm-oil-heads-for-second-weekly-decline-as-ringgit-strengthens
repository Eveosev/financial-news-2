Palm oil  fell, set for a second
weekly drop, as the Malaysian currency gained against the dollar,
reducing the appeal of ringgit-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in June dropped as much as 1.7
percent to 2,351 ringgit ($768) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, before trading at 2,362 ringgit at the
midday break in Kuala Lumpur. Futures are heading for a 0.7
percent loss this week after a 4.6 percent decline in the
previous five sessions.  Malaysia’s ringgit was headed for its biggest weekly gain
since September after Prime Minister Najib Razak dissolved
parliament on April 3, paving the way for polls to be held in
the coming weeks. The currency, which reached a seven-month low
of 3.1395 on March 18, has rallied 1.1 percent this month to
3.0613 a dollar.  “The ringgit is getting stronger and pressuring prices
lower,” Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at LT International
Futures Sdn., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur . The losses in
soybeans are also weakened prices, he said.  The oilseed, which can be crushed to make  soybean oil ,
traded near its lowest close in three months as the death toll
from a new strain of bird flu in  China  rose, increasing concerns
poultry meat consumption and feed use in the world’s largest
buyer of soybeans may slow. Beans for delivery in May declined
0.6 percent to $13.6425 a bushel. Futures closed at $13.72
yesterday, the lowest since January 4.  Soybean oil for May delivery was little changed at 48.58
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, heading for a 3.1
percent weekly loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
