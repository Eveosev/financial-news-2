Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of
the world’s largest oil refining complex, plans to borrow about
$2 billion to refinance debt, according to three people familiar
with the matter.  Mumbai-based Reliance, controlled by billionaire  Mukesh Ambani , is in talks with banks for a five-year loan, the people
said, asking not to be identified, because the terms aren’t set.
Outstanding debt at the company as of Dec. 31 was 722.66 billion
rupees ($13.2 billion), compared with 682.59 billion rupees a
year earlier, figures on its website show.  A Reliance spokesman didn’t immediately reply to e-mailed
questions seeking comment on the financing.  The company borrowed an unprecedented $5.8 billion overseas
in 2012 and will spend $27 billion in five years to build
petrochemical plants and drill wells, Deutsche Bank AG
estimates. The company, India’s second-most indebted, has $19
billion of bonds and loans outstanding, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s cash pile stood at $13.3
billion on Dec. 31, versus $8.9 billion a year earlier, the data
show.  Reliance’s shares rose 1.6 percent to 780.10 rupees in
Mumbai today. The stock has declined 7.1 percent this year,
compared with a 5 percent loss in the S&P BSE Sensex index.  Reliance was the biggest issuer of foreign-currency bonds
from  India  in 2012, and also the nation’s No. 1 borrower in the
dollar loan market, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
