Prince Fielder hit two home runs and
the Detroit Tigers beat the New York Yankees 8-3 in the Tigers’
home opener.  Eduardo Nunez, who is filling in for Derek Jeter at
shortstop as the Yankees’ captain recovers from a broken ankle,
left the game in the fourth inning, visibly in pain, after being
hit in the right biceps by a Doug Fister pitch. X-rays were
negative and Nunez is listed as day to day, the team said on
Twitter. Jayson Nix filled in at shortstop for Nunez.  Fielder had five runs batted in, hitting homers off
relievers Boone Logan and Shawn Kelley. Ivan Nova took the loss
for New York (1-3), giving up four earned runs on five hits in 4
2/3 innings.  Fister got the win for Detroit (2-2), pitching five innings
while allowing three earned runs on six hits, including a homer
by Kevin Youkilis, his first as a Yankee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
