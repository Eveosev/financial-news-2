Swiss stocks  retreated for a third
day, after falling the most in five weeks yesterday, as
investors awaited a monthly report on employment in the U.S.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA slipped 1 percent.  Dufry AG (DUFN) 
gained 0.7 percent after it signed a contract to run duty-free
shops at a Brazilian airport.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  lost 0.2 percent to 7,747.2 at 10:01
a.m. in Zurich. The equity benchmark dropped 1.4 percent
yesterday as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  warned
of risks to the euro area’s economic recovery in the second
half. The gauge is headed for a weekly drop of 0.9 percent. The
broader Swiss Performance Index also fell 0.3 percent today.  The number of stocks changing hands in the SMI was 21
percent lower than the average of the past 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Today’s non-farm payrolls data may show employers in the
world’s largest economy hired a net 190,000 workers in March and
the  unemployment rate  held at a four-year low of 7.7 percent,
according to the median forecasts in Bloomberg surveys. That
compares with an increase of 236,000 in February.  Richemont, the maker of the Cartier brand, fell 1 percent
to 72.70 francs.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the biggest maker of Swiss
watches, dropped 0.7 percent to 536 francs.  Nestle SA, the world’s largest food company which accounts
for 23 percent of  the SMI , slid 1 percent to 68.05 francs.  Dufry gained 0.7 percent to 117 francs. The Swiss operator
of duty-free stores in airports signed a 10-year contract to
