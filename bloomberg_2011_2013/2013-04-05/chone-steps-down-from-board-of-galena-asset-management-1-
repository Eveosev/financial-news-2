Cedric Chone stepped down from the
board of Galena Asset Management Ltd. to make way for non-
executive directors.  Chone continues to be portfolio manager at Galena Special
Situations Fund, according to Geneva-based spokeswoman Victoria
Dix. A filing with the U.K.’s Companies House showed his
resignation from the board was on April 1.  Special Situations is a long-only equity fund investing in
mining and energy projects, Dix said. Special Situations shares
lost 6 percent this year through February after dropping 25
percent in 2011 and 4.6 percent in 2012, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The fund’s class-B shares fell 7.7 percent, 28
percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, during the same periods.  By comparison, the  Stoxx 600 Basic Resources Index (SXPP)  of
European companies fell 4.8 percent this year through February,
after plunging 30 percent in 2011 and rising 4.2 percent last
year.  Claude Lixi, the head of Galena’s energy hedge fund, left
in January, people familiar with the departure said at the time.
Galena, a unit of Trafigura Beheer BV, also has a  metals hedge
fund , which declined in 2012 for its first annual loss since its
inception in 2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
