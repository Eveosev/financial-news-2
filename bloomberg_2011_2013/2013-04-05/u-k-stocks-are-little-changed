U.K. stocks  declined for a third day
as investors awaited a monthly report on U.S. payrolls to gauge
the strength of the world’s biggest economy.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA tracked losses
in European carriers as the death toll from a new strain of bird
flu in China rose. European Natural Resources Corp. soared after
UBS AG and Liberum Capital Ltd. recommended buying the shares.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  fell 23.77 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,320.35
at 9:31 a.m. in London, heading for a 1.4 percent weekly loss.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index dropped 0.3 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated 0.5 percent. The FTSE 100
has still rallied 7.2 percent this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed
on a compromise budget and data fueled optimism that the world’s
biggest economy is recovering.  U.K. stocks yesterday posted the biggest two-day drop since
July as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said he
sees risks to the euro area’s economic recovery.  Today’s non-farm payrolls data may show U.S. employers
hired a net 190,000 workers last month and the unemployment rate
held at a four-year low of 7.7 percent as demand improved at the
start of the year, according to the median economist forecast in
a Bloomberg survey. That compares with an increase of 236,000 in
February.  IAG (IAG) , the parent of British Airways, slid 3.7 percent to
22.9 pence.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  lost 3.9 percent to 1,054 pence. The
death toll from a new strain of bird flu in China rose to six
people as authorities in Shanghai shut several poultry markets
and culled birds.  Perform Group Plc (PER)  sank 6.3 percent to 445.5 pence. Hans
Thomas Gross is selling a 5.4 percent stake in the online sports
broadcaster, according to terms obtained by Bloomberg.  ENRC, Kazakhstan’s biggest copper producer, surged 5.1
percent to 247.2 pence. UBS and Liberum both raised their
recommendations on the shares to buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
