BlackBerry’s new Q10 smartphone, a
model that retains the company’s hallmark physical-keyboard
design, is now available for pre-ordering in the U.K., the first
country to offer the device.  “Today,  Carphone Warehouse (CPW)  customers in the  United Kingdom 
will be able to pre-order the BlackBerry Q10 on O2, Orange, T-
Mobile, Three, EE and TalkMobile,” BlackBerry said on the
company’s blog. “The handset will be available for purchase in
Carphone Warehouse stores from the end of April.”  The Q10 is the second phone to use BlackBerry’s revamped
BB10 operating system. Unlike the first model, which sported an
iPhone-like touch screen, the Q10 has the keyboard prized by
many BlackBerry loyalists. Its debut in the U.K. mimics the
rollout of the touch-screen Z10, which was released in that
country before appearing in other European nations, Canada and
the U.S.  The Waterloo, Ontario-based company said it will have
details soon on when the Q10 will appear in other markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
