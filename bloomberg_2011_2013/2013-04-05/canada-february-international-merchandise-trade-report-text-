The following is the text of
Canada’s international merchandise trade report for February
from  Statistics Canada .  Canada’s merchandise exports decreased 0.6% in February,
while imports edged up 0.1%. As a result, Canada’s trade deficit
with the world widened from $746 million in January to $1.0
billion in February.  Exports decreased to $38.5 billion, as volumes were down
0.6% and prices were flat. Overall, exports of metal and non-
metallic mineral products contributed the most to the decline.
This was partially offset by an increase in motor vehicles and
parts.  Imports edged up to $39.5 billion, as prices rose 0.6% and
volumes declined 0.4%. Increases in 7 of the 11 import sections
were mostly offset by a large decrease of energy products.  Exports to the  United States  decreased 1.1% to $28.4
billion in February, while imports were up 0.8% to $25.0 billion.
Consequently, Canada’s trade surplus with the United States
decreased from $3.9 billion in January to $3.4 billion in
February.  Exports to countries other than the United States increased
0.9% to $10.1 billion. Imports declined 0.9% to $14.5 billion.
As a result, Canada’s trade deficit with countries other than
the United States narrowed from $4.6 billion in January to $4.4
billion in February.  Metal and non-metallic mineral products section leads decline in
exports  Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products declined
7.0% to $4.7 billion in February, as prices decreased 5.9%. The
main contributor to the overall decline was exports of unwrought
precious metals and precious metal alloys, which fell 16.3%.  After three consecutive monthly increases, exports of basic
and industrial chemical, plastic and rubber products decreased
4.3% to $2.8 billion in February. Lower volumes of dyes and
pigments; petrochemicals (-23.8%) and of basic chemicals (-
19.6%) led the decline. Partially offsetting these declines were
higher exports of lubricants and other petroleum refinery
products, which rose as a result of both higher prices and
volumes.  Exports of electronic and electrical equipment declined
5.2% to $1.8 billion. Widespread decreases were recorded
throughout the section, led by lower exports of communications
and audio and video equipment as well as electronic and
electrical parts.  Exports of motor vehicles and parts rose 5.6% to $5.4
billion, led by higher volumes of passenger cars and light
trucks (+4.4%).  Rise in imports moderated by decline in energy products  Imports of motor vehicles and parts increased 5.5% to $6.8
billion in February, on higher volumes (+4.7%). The overall gain
was split between passenger cars and light trucks (+6.0%), and
motor vehicle engines and motor vehicle parts (+6.1%).  Imports of basic and industrial chemical, plastic and
rubber products rose 10.3% to $3.4 billion. The increase was led
by a 48.5% gain in volumes of lubricants and other petroleum
refinery products. Also contributing to the overall gain were
higher imports of basic chemicals, and of fertilizer, pesticide
and other chemical products.  Widespread increases led imports of  consumer goods  to rise
2.3% in February to a record high of $8.0 billion. Overall,
prices grew 1.3%, and volumes were up 1.0%.  Imports of energy products fell 19.3% to $3.5 billion, as a
result of lower volumes (-18.7%). Imports of crude oil and crude
bitumen declined 25.8% to lead the overall decrease.  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States,  Japan  and the  United Kingdom . Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula (2007=100).  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010 -
X201000311141&amp;lang=fra) .  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data are revised with the
release of the January, February and March reference months.
Revisions to BOP based data for the previous three years are
released annually in June with the April reference month.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
section with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables.  Canada ’s merchandise trade: An annual overview of 2012  In 2012, Canada’s annual merchandise imports grew at a
faster pace than its exports, rising 4.2% and 1.3%, respectively.  Total imports rose to $474.5 billion, a level 7.0% higher
than in 2008. Imports of motor vehicles and parts, up 11.7% to
$82.8 billion in 2012, were the main contributor to the annual
and four-year growth, as structural changes occurred in the
automobile manufacturing industry following the downturn in 2009.
Moreover, motor vehicles and parts’ share of total imports
reached 17.5% in 2012, compared with 16.6% in 2008 and 16.3% in
2011.  Canada’s merchandise exports rose to $462.6 billion in 2012,
the third consecutive annual gain. However, the total level of
exports was 5.1% lower than the record high reached in 2008. In
2012, two sections, motor vehicles and parts and farm, fishing
and intermediate food products, had higher export levels
compared with 2008. The annual gain in motor vehicles and parts
(+14.9%), was largely the result of higher exports of passenger
cars and light trucks. Exports of farm, fishing and intermediate
food products (+13.0%) increased as a result of favourable
weather conditions in Canada, while other major exporting
nations experienced drought conditions. Partially offsetting the
annual increase in exports was the metal and non-metallic
mineral products section, while the energy products section
recorded the largest decline from 2008 to 2012.  Canada’s annual trade balance with the world went from a
surplus of $912 million in 2011 to a record deficit of $12.0
billion in 2012. This was the result of a lower  trade surplus 
with Canada’s largest trading partner, the United States, as
well as a larger trade deficit with countries other than the
United States.  Canada’s trade surplus with the United States narrowed from
$48.9 billion in 2011 to $42.0 billion in 2012, less than half
of what was recorded in 2008. In 2012, Canada’s imports from the
United States gained 5.5%, while exports to the United States
were up 2.6%.  In 2012, the share of Canada’s exports to and imports from
the United States increased to 73.2% and 62.5%, respectively.
The exports’ share grew for the first time in 7 years, while the
imports’ share rose for the first time in 14 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
