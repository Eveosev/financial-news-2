     April 5 (Bloomberg) --  Intrade , the betting website that
halted trading last month amid a probe into suspected financial
irregularities, told customers it has found a $700,000 shortfall
in client funds as it seeks their backing for a survival plan.  The Dublin-based company uncovered the shortfall after comparing
cash on hand and in member accounts with balances on the exchange’s
system, Ronald Bernstein, who became a director in November and
is leading the rescue effort, said in an e-mail to clients this,
a copy of which was obtained by  Bloomberg News . He confirmed the
letter’s contents.  Intrade, which let people bet against one another on the
outcomes of events, such as U.S. presidential elections, stopped
taking wagers and froze member accounts on March 10 after saying
it had uncovered suspected financial irregularities. The company
is now asking members to accept immediate repayment of half
their frozen money and waive claims to the rest on the “solemn
promise” that Intrade will try to refund that later.  The company is “extremely likely to be forced into
liquidation” if members don’t support the plan, Bernstein said.
Almost all of the 40 members with the largest account balances
have agreed to support the proposal, he added. “If the group
that I have spoken with remains fully intact, I believe the
company can, in fact, remain solvent,” he said.  Investors have until April 9 to sign up to the plan, he
wrote. The company is still in “active” talks with investors
to secure its financial position, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
