Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA ,
the Italian lender engulfed by probes into alleged misconduct by
former managers, said its 2011 loss will widen by 1 billion
euros ($1.3 billion) if two so-called repos are accounted for as
credit-default swaps.  The 2011 net loss for group’s main company rises to 5.7
billion euros from 4.7 billion euros under pro-forma accounts
that restate deals dubbed Alexandria and Santorini, the bank
said in its annual report published today. The 2012 loss falls
to 2.9 billion euros from 3.1 billion euros, and net assets to
191.7 billion euros from 197.1 billion euros.  Paschi calculated the impact of a different accounting
treatment at the request of Italian regulators, which on March 8
urged financial firms to examine repo contracts “closely.” A
consumer group that challenged Monte Paschi’s bailout alleged in
a court filing in February that the bank was misrepresenting
derivatives transactions as loans.  In the two transactions that weren’t fully disclosed to
shareholders, the bank made money-losing bets on the country’s
government bonds in structured deals disguised as loans that hid
existing losses. The bank restated its accounts to reflect the
hidden losses on Feb. 6.  Bloomberg News  first reported on
Santorini on Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
