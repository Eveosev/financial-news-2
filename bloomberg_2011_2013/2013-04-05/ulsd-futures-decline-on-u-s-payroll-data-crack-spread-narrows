Ultra-low sulfur diesel slid for a
third day after U.S. employers hired fewer workers in March,
raising concern that economic growth and fuel demand is slowing.
The crack spread on Nymex narrowed.  Futures fell as Labor Department figures showed the
smallest payroll growth in nine months and the  jobless rate  at a
four-year low because the  labor force  is shrinking. Two reports
earlier this week showed manufacturing and service sectors
expanded more slowly. ULSD’s crack spread versus WTI declined 50
cents to $30.71 a barrel and its premium to gasoline narrowed.  “Today’s unemployment number is horrible,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc., an energy advisory
company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “You’re marrying lousy
economic headlines with the current trend we’ve seen in
manufacturing. Distillate is more of a link to the industrial
than gasoline, whose use tends to be discretionary.”  Ultra-low-sulfur-diesel for May delivery fell 3.5 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.9286 a gallon at 10:04 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 22 percent above the
100-day average for the time of day.  ULSD’s premium to gasoline narrowed by 1.7 cents to 4.7
cents a gallon. The fuel’s crack spread versus Brent slipped 1
cent to $18.12 a barrel.  Payrolls grew by 88,000 workers last month, after a revised
268,000 gain in February that was higher than first estimated,
Labor Department figures showed. The jobless rate fell to 7.6
percent from 7.7 percent. The  labor force participation rate 
fell to 63.3 percent, the lowest since May 1979.  Factory Index  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  factory index  fell to
51.3 from an almost two-year high of 54.2 in February, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group’s figures showed on April 1.  The ISM
index of U.S.  non-manufacturing businesses , which covers almost
90 percent of the economy, fell to 54.4 in March from 56 in the
prior month.  Gasoline for May delivery fell 1.711 cents, or 0.6 percent
to $2.8816 a gallon on volume that was 8.7 percent above the
100-day average.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 1.1 cents
to $3.625 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices are
31.1 cents below a year earlier, when prices reached a 2012 high
of $3.936.  To contact the reporter on this story:
