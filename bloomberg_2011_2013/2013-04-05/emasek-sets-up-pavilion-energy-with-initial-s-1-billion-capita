Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore ’s
state-owned investment company, has set up an energy company to
tap growing demand in Asia and focus on liquefied natural gas.  Pavilion Energy Pte has an initial authorized capital of
S$1 billion ($806 million) and will be operational in September,
Pavilion Energy said in an e-mailed statement today. The company
will be led by Seah Moon Ming, who joined Temasek as of March.  The energy company expects “to participate and invest in
various parts of the LNG value chain to ensure long term LNG
supply,” Seah said in the statement.  “These could include LNG trading; investing alongside
international oil and gas companies as partners to develop
upstream LNG projects; building of LNG storage and re-
gasification terminals; and investing in LNG shipping,” Seah
said. “Long term secure and reliable supply is critical to
success in the LNG business.”  Pavilion may invest alongside Temasek, which has been
stepping up its investments in the energy and resources sectors
over the past few years, according to the statement.  Pavilion named Hassan Marican, former CEO of Petroliam
Nasional Bhd.,  Malaysia ’s state-owned oil company also known as
Petronas, as chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
