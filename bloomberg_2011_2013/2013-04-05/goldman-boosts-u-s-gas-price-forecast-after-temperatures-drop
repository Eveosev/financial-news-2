Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
forecast for U.S. natural gas futures for the remainder of this
year on a “tightening shift” in market fundamentals after
temperatures fell last month.  Futures in New York will average $4.40 per million British
thermal units for the balance of 2013, Goldman said in a report
e-mailed today. That’s a 17 percent increase from its previous
forecast of $3.75. Cold weather in the U.S. reduced inventories
to 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of last month, from 2.5
trillion a year ago, according to the bank.  “We believe the need for more production and less need for
coal-to-gas switching will allow prices to move higher,” said
Johan Spetz, a commodity analyst at Goldman in New York. “A
return to growing production is required to balance the market
after this summer.”  Benchmark natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange climbed 15 percent in March, the most in half a year,
as cold weather increased demand and drained stockpiles in the
U.S. The contract for May delivery was at $3.96 per million
British thermal units, up 0.3 percent, in electronic trading on
Nymex today.  Goldman also opened a trading recommendation to buy call
options on gas for November 2013 at $4.20 per million British
thermal units. The bank maintained its forecast for 2014 at
$4.25, citing a possible increase in supply.  “We believe prices are likely to face resistance above
$4.25 in the near term as coal-to-gas switching is still needed
to balance the market,” Spetz said. “Net, we expect U.S.
natural gas production to be flat year-on-year in 2013 before
returning to close to 2 billion cubic feet a day growth in 2014
year-on-year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
