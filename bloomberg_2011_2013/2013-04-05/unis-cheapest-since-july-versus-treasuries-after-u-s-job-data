U.S. municipal yields are the
highest since July compared with  interest rates  on Treasuries,
as local debt trailed a fixed-income rally spurred by a weaker-
than-projected labor report.  Yields on benchmark munis due in 10 years were  1.93 percent 
at 10 a.m. in  New York , compared with  1.69 percent  for
comparable-maturity Treasuries, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The ratio between the two interest rates is  114 percent , the
highest since July 25.  Treasuries gained after the Labor Department reported that
payrolls grew by 88,000 workers in March, the least in nine
months. The median forecast of 87 economists in a Bloomberg
Survey called for an increase of 190,000. The  unemployment rate 
fell to 7.6 percent, the lowest since 2008.  Issuers from  California  to Florida plan to sell $10.1
billion of debt next week, the most  issuance  since December,
Bloomberg data show. The cheapening of munis relative to
Treasuries will help localities find buyers, said Clark Wagner,
fixed-income director at First Investors Management co. in New
York, which manages $1.6 billion of munis  “If we go into next week with this market tone, it will be
a lot easier to get the deals done,” Wagner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
