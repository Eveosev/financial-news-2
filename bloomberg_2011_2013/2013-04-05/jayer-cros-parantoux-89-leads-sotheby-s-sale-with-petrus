A case of Vosne-Romanee Cros
Parantoux 1989 from Burgundy winegrower Henri Jayer priced to
fetch as much as 44,000 pounds ($67,000) is among leading lots
at a  Sotheby’s  auction in London this month.  The sale on April 17 also contains six magnums of Chateau
Petrus 1990 Pomerol carrying a top estimate of 28,000 pounds,
five bottles of Richebourg 1987 Jayer for as much as 18,000
pounds and a case of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 Pauillac
priced to fetch as much as 30,000 pounds, according to  Sotheby’s (BID) 
online catalog.  The London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has rallied 10
percent since November, when it touched its lowest level since
March 2010. A 0.3 percent gain in March was its fourth straight
increase and followed a February advance of 2.9 percent. A
recovery in Bordeaux first-growth wines such as Lafite has
helped boost the index.  A case of Jayer’s Cros Parantoux 1989 wine sold for HK$1.82
million ($234,000) at a Christie’s International Plc sale in
 Hong Kong  in February 2012, as Chinese demand for Burgundies was
surging. A similar 12-bottle lot sold for $90,750 at a
Christie’s auction in  New York  in April last year.  One case of Lafite 1982 sold for 34,500 pounds at a
 Christie’s  auction in London in February, while another with
more variable wine levels in the bottles fetched 23,000 pounds
at the same sale.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
