Former Treasury Secretary  Lawrence Summers  said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that he
expects healthy economic growth in the U.S. this year and next
and doesn’t see a “need to panic” over a March employment
report that shows slowing  job creation .  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

Treasury secretary and national economic director for President
Obama. Thank you for being with us, Dr. Summers.  LAWRENCE SUMMERS: Good to be with you, Al.  HUNT: Disappointing March jobs report. What are the chances
that the economy is losing momentum after a strong start?  SUMMERS: It wasn’t a great report. Probably better than it
looked. The previous month’s numbers were revised upwards. The
average workweek was pretty good. The  unemployment rate  went
down. But it’s hard to feel better after the report than one
felt before.  There was a sense that the first quarter might come in
above 3 percent. I don’t -- I don’t think we’ve got growth above
3 percent locked in for the year by any means. But I don’t think
we need to panic over this report by any stretch. I think the
basic momentum of an economy that is growing and is growing at a
rate that is closing the unemployment gap, that’s probably still
there, but we certainly could use more confidence, we certainly
could use more demand, we certainly could use fiscal policy
being in a different place.  HUNT: If we don’t achieve 3 percent growth this year, what
do you think we will achieve? And what will - what - what will
we achieve next year?  SUMMERS: My guess is still that we’re going to be north of
2.5 percent this year and that it’s going to accelerate into
next year.  HUNT: Above 3 percent next year?  SUMMERS: You’ve got a good chance for above 3 percent next
year. You’ve got a number of things. You’ve got housing, which
is really starting to turn. You have a stock market that’s been
robust, it’s created wealth, that’s going to drive spending. You
have consumer balance sheets that have improved. People are less
in debt. You have an energy sector that’s got a lot of
opportunity in it in the United States in a way that most people
didn’t expect.  HUNT: But you’ve generally supported the  Federal Reserve ’s
quantitative easing. How soon do you think the central bank
needs to ease off? And how real is the worry that ultimately --
not short term -- ultimately it’ll lead to serious inflation?  SUMMERS: Old Treasury secretary habits die hard, Al, and so
I’m not going to prescribe or describe regarding the Fed. It is
still the case right now that the risks in the United States of
the kind of mistake we made in 1937 or the kind of mistake
that’s been made repeatedly in  Japan , where you never get all
the way back to normal, are greater than the risks of what was
the case in the  United States  in the 1970s, where you misjudged
the situation and let there be stagflation.  But, look, you’ve got to be watching it every minute.
You’ve got to be watching all the indicators on inflation, all
the indicators on tightness in labor markets, tightness in
product markets, and at the Federal Reserve, you have to be
thinking very carefully about exit strategy, as well as entrance
strategy --  HUNT: You mentioned -  SUMMERS: --  so it’s a -- it’s a very complicated balance
that needs -- that needs to be struck, but, yes, I do think at
this point the risks of slowdown still significantly exceed the
risks of an acceleration of inflation. But anyone who is
completely serene about either I think is making a real mistake.  HUNT: You mentioned Japan. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  just took a
really radical step, more radical than the Fed, with the --
first of all, was it the right step, do you think? And their
goal is to dampen down or end deflationary expectations, while
still producing an increase to a manageable inflation rate of
about 2 percent. Do you think it’ll work? And was it a right
move?  SUMMERS: I think the impulse to discontinuity was right in
Japan. The path they were on wasn’t working for them. Debt was
rising, and prices were falling. The economy was falling. It was
like the old Al Gore thing about what’s up should be up and
what’s down should be down, and it was exactly the reverse in --
in Japan.  Whether this -- they are really in uncharted territory, and
I think the world’s going to learn a lot from their experiment,
Al. I do think they were right to be moving -- moving strongly,
and I think on the evidence of the Japanese stock market, on the
evidence of expectations in Japan over the last several months,
you’d have to say that there’s a positive verdict on what
they’ve been doing so far, but when you’ve had macro-
economically irresponsible policies in the past, they often
produce benefits that are very great for the first number of
months and, like coiling a spring, provide for problems later.  So I think that it’s a -- it’s a bold -- it’s a bold
experiment they’ve undertaken in Japan.  HUNT: Let’s shift to  Europe , where there is austerity,
which I think you think has been overdone or it’s a mistake. I
guess what I really want to ask you is, what are the
consequences? Could democracies be threatened by this all pain
and no gain for a long time?  SUMMERS: You know, could -- could this all work out? If you
look at what markets are pricing, they’re certainly assigning
much less risk to Italy and  Spain  than they were nine months ago
or a year ago, and that has got to say that something there is -
- is working. But it seems to me the awkwardness with which they
handled the Cyprus situation has got to have created a
substantial sense of unease in Europe, and that is something
that I think is worth worrying about.  HUNT: Let me come back home again. Corporate or individual
income tax reform, do you think either has a chance? What are
the prospects?  SUMMERS: I don’t think either is an odds-on bet at this --
at this point. I do think that it’s -- of all the propositions
that there are, probably there are none that would command
support across a wider range of economists than the idea that a
broader base and a lower rate is fairer and makes the economy
grow --  HUNT: But -- but not likely to happen.  SUMMERS: -- makes the economy grow better. But you’re
better at political prognostication than I, Al, and I wouldn’t
be betting on it.  HUNT: President Obama’s budget came out. Does he have the
right mix of entitlements cutbacks and tax hikes? Would you
alter it a little bit? And you see what’s happened in the last
couple years. Do you think there’s any prospects for a grand
bargain?  SUMMERS: I think President Obama’s budget is -- doesn’t
have all the elements that he would prefer; it certainly doesn’t
have all the elements that I would prefer, all the mix that many
people on his side would prefer. But I think it’s a budget that
will remove a lot of excuses for those who do not want to
negotiate.  HUNT: You think Republicans will eventually have to
negotiate?  SUMMERS: You know, what they’ll decide to do, I wouldn’t
presume to try to judge. But President Obama’s budget is
balanced. It recognizes that entitlements have to be part of an
ultimate solution. It recognizes that civilian spending has to
be part of a solution.  HUNT: Dr.  Larry Summers , thank you so much.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
