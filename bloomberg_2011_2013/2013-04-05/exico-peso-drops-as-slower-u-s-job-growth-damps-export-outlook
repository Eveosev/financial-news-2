Mexico ’s peso tumbled as U.S.
employers hired fewer workers than forecast in March, hurting
prospects for the Latin American nation’s top export market.  The peso fell 0.6 percent to 12.3740 per  U.S. dollar  at
7:26 a.m. in Mexico City, after earlier touching 12.4 per
dollar, the weakest intraday level since March 27. The drop
pared the peso’s decline this week to 0.4 percent. It is still
up 3.8 percent in 2013, the most among 16 major dollar
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  Payrolls in the U.S. grew by 88,000 workers, the smallest
gain in nine months and less than the most-pessimistic
projection among 87 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, Labor
Department data showed today in  Washington . The median forecast
called for a 190,000 gain. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its
exports to the U.S., its northern neighbor and partner in the
 North American Free Trade Agreement .  The peso “is responding to the non-farm payrolls data,”
Roberto Galvan, a currency trader at Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA,
said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. “No one in the
market expected this.”  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.91 percent today, within
three basis points of the March 13 record low, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.59 centavo to 145.29
centavos per peso, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
