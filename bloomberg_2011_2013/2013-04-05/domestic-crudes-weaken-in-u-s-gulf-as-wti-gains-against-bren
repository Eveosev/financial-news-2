Gulf of Mexico  crudes weakened
against West Texas Intermediate as the domestic benchmark
strengthened by almost $1 a barrel against Brent.  WTI gained 87 cents to a discount of $12.21 a barrel
against Brent, the marker for international grades shipped to
the U.S., after euro-area retail sales fell in February and a
prediction by Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the
 International Energy Agency , that oil demand will be “less than
it was before” in the next few months.  When Brent drops versus WTI, it typically weakens the value
of U.S. grades that compete with foreign crudes priced against
Brent.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened $1.40 to
$15.75 a barrel at 12:06 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet dropped 50 cents to
trade at $15.50 over WTI.  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI dropped by 70 cents to $11.10 a
barrel, while Poseidon lost $1.10 to $10.90 over the benchmark.
The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur content
than Mars and Poseidon, narrowed by 75 cents to $14.  Bakken crude delivered at Clearbrook,  Minnesota , weakened
25 cents a barrel to a $1.25-a-barrel premium to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
