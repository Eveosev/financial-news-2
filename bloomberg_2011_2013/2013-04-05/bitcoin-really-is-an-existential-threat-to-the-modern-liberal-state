So far, Bitcoin is not a big deal. Its total value in circulation was  $1.4 billion  as of this week. That's equivalent to the currency stock of a small nation -- somewhere between Iceland and Uruguay -- and just  one-thousandth  of the total value of U.S. dollars in circulation. The volume of  transactions  in Bitcoin is growing only slowly, relative to the  massive increase in demand  for the currency: This discrepancy is strong evidence that Bitcoin’s rise is a speculative bubble. Nonetheless, Bitcoin raises some interesting questions. One is whether it might undermine the modern state -- which, for many of its libertarian-anarchist advocates, is the whole idea.  Technology  enabled governments  to grow more powerful and more centralized in the 19th and 20th centuries, as Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, has argued. The intriguing possibility is that technologies of the 21st century -- such as Bitcoin -- might push the other way.  Physical cash is used in a rapidly shrinking share of transactions:  27 percent  in 2011, 23 percent by 2017, and so on, according to Javelin Strategy & Research, a financial-services research firm. The central banks of  Sweden  and  Nigeria  have both declared goals of a cashless economy. In Europe, the volume of non-cash transactions is forecasted to rise by  7 percent  per year, despite economic stagnation. What's going on? First, a global shift to mobile payments and credit and debit cards. Second, a rise in online retail -- one that could put  15 to 20 percent  of all retail sales online in the U.S., U.K., China, and Europe, according to  Bain & Company . Electronic payments aren't new. Bitcoin's only innovations are its status as an independent currency and its decentralized network design. But those differences might make Bitcoin -- or rather, crypto-currency in general -- an existential threat to the modern liberal state. If widely adopted, crypto-currencies would cripple government in three central functions: taxation, police and macroeconomic stabilization. That is exactly what Bitcoin's biggest fans are  hoping . If Bitcoin remains on the fringes, then the state is safe. The question is, if it shows signs of becoming a widely used currency, what could governments do to crush it? The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the wing of the U.S. Treasury Department that investigates money laundering,  said  last month that it has the authority to regulate transactions involving both Bitcoin and U.S. dollars under the Bank Secrecy Act. These inter-currency exchanges appear to be the best foothold for regulation. Governments could require records of all purchases and sales of Bitcoin, for instance.  But this approach has severe limits. There are, by design, no direct avenues for government to interpose itself in Bitcoin-only transactions. Government does have some enforcement leverage over the individuals and businesses. Bitcoin transactions have a real-world side. The problem, though, is that the usual mechanisms for detection and enforcement are very weak against Bitcoin. Ask the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Bitcoin presents “distinct challenges for deterring illicit activity,” according to a leaked intelligence assessment that was prepared in April 2012. "Bitcoin is unique because it is the only decentralized, P2P network-based virtual currency,” the FBI’s Cyber Intelligence and Criminal Intelligence Sections wrote. “The way it creates, operates, and distributes bitcoins makes it distinctively susceptible to illicit money transfers.” Bitcoin may be a bubble that will burst. If it does, other forms of digital cash will come along. The state was intimately involved in  the development of money  -- but that was before networked computers. In the next chapter of the history of currency, money might very well turn on its creator, and roll back government.  (Evan Soltas is a contributor to the Ticker.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
