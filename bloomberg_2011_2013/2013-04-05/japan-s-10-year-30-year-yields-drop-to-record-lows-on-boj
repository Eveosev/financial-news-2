Japan ’s government bonds fell,
pushing up 10-year yields from a record low on speculation
recent gains on the securities were excessive.  Bond futures plunged, causing the Tokyo Stock Exchange to
issue circuit breakers twice for the contracts. Yields on 10-
and 30-year debt earlier sank to record lows following the  Bank
of Japan (8301) ’s decision yesterday to extend the maturity of
securities it buys to 40 years and double monthly purchases.
Twenty-year yields touched the lowest level in a decade.  “The market will remain volatile for some time,” said
Shuichi Ohsaki, strategist Tokyo at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. “There’s a clash of interest between those who are
expecting further gains and those who want to take profits.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 0.505 percent at 2:31 p.m.
in  Tokyo , after earlier falling as much as 14 basis points to
0.315 percent, the lowest on record, according to Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery slid 1.60 to 144.44
after earlier reaching 146.44, the highest on record.  The 14-day relative strength index on the contracts reached
the 70 level yesterday that some traders see as a sign an
asset’s price may reverse direction after rising too rapidly.  Yields on 30-year bonds had touched 0.925 percent, the
lowest on record, while the 20-year rate reached 0.845 percent,
a level unseen since June 2003. The 30-year yield fell 2 1/2
basis points to 1.225 percent from yesterday, and 20-year rates
were little changed at 1.135 percent.  The BOJ said yesterday it will buy 7.5 trillion yen ($77.8
billion) of bonds a month and extend the average maturity of the
debt it purchases to seven years from about three years. The
central bank “temporarily suspended” the self-imposed rule to
keep the value of its bond holdings below the amount of cash in
circulation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
