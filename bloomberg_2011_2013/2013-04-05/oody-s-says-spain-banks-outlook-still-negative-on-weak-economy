The outlook for Spain’s banks
remains negative as recession threatens to push up loan defaults
across all asset classes in the euro area’s fourth-largest
economy, Moody’s Investors Service said.  “The main driver of the outlook is the rating agency’s
expectation that the banks will continue to operate in a
recessionary environment burdened by high levels of non-
performing assets that are expected to significantly deteriorate
further,” Moody’s said in a statement today.  An economic slump entering its sixth year is driving up
loan defaults for banks already struggling with the impact of
low interest rates and  weak credit  demand.  Bad loans  as a
proportion of total lending stand at 10.8 percent after about
160 billion euros ($208 billion) of credit  turned sour  since
early 2007 amid the country’s property crash.  Moody’s said it’s monitoring the impact of legal rulings
and government decisions that could affect Spain’s 600 billion-
euro stock of mortgages. The Spanish government announced
proposals in January that may widen the scope for partial
mortgage debt forgiveness, while the European Court of Justice
ruled against Spain’s legal framework, which it considered to be
in violation of consumer protection laws.  Any potential increase in residential mortgage losses
“could challenge the solvency of a much broader group of banks
than those having suffered from the real estate crisis and could
increase the negative rating pressure for most Spanish banks,”
Moody’s said.  Funding Reliance  Moody’s said its outlook on Spanish banks, which has been
negative since 2008, also took into account their high reliance
on funding from the European Central Bank, their credit
exposures to the Spanish government and their restricted access
to funding markets.  “Improved bank-capital levels, partly because of current
recapitalization efforts, do not fully offset these sources of
rating pressure, especially if the economy does not improve
notably during 2013,” Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
