Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the world’s largest
maker of fuel from coal, is considering the sale of its gas
assets in the island-state of  Papua New Guinea .  “Sasol is considering divesting from Papua New Guinea,”
Alex Anderson, a spokesman, said in an e-mailed response to
questions. “We are currently engaging interested parties.” The
Johannesburg-based company started exploring for natural gas in
Papua New Guinea during 2008.  Sasol is also in discussions to sell its 50 percent-stake
in Iranian unit Arya Sasol Polymer Co. which it co-owns with
Pars Petrochemical Co. of Iran, a unit of National
Petrochemical. Sasol wrote down the unit’s value by 1.97 billion
rand ($215 million) for the six months through December.  The U.S. and the European Union are pressuring Iran to end
its nuclear program, which they say is aimed at developing an
atomic weapon.  Iran  denies it is trying to make military
devices, saying its nuclear research is for civilian use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
