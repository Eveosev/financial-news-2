European authorities will consider
the impact on sovereign finances of the proposed merger between
 National Bank of Greece SA  and  Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) , European
Commission spokesman Olivier Bailly said today.  Bailly said he could not confirm reports in the Greek media
that the so-called troika administering the country’s bailout is
blocking or slowing the planned merger between the two banks. In
comments to reporters in Brussels, he said the merger would
receive extra layers of review linked to  Greece ’s 130 billion-
euro ($168 billion) second bailout.  “When it comes to a country under financial assistance, of
course we have to make sure that this will not have an impact on
the level of defict and debt of the concerned country,” Bailly
said. “We have to go beyond just the assessment of the EU rules
related to mergers and we have to also integrate the possible
impact on the public deficit or the public debt, especially if
the state concerned would like to increase its share in the
future entity.”  The troika, which is made up of the European Commission,
the  European Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund ,
is currently in talks with officials in Athens about Greece’s
program. Bailly declined to provide details on the discussions.  Greece has proposed state aid for banks including National
Bank and Eurobank, which still needs EU approval. The proposed
merger is not yet under formal review by the EU’s competition
agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
