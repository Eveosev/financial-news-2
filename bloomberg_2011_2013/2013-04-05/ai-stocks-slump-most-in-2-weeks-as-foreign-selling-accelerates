Thailand ’s  stocks  tumbled the most
in two weeks after a selloff by global funds weakened the
outlook of the nation’s equities.  The  SET Index (SET)  slid 2.6 percent to close at 1,489.53, the
biggest decline in Asia after the Hong Kong’s benchmark  gauge .
The Thai measure sank 4.6 percent this week, capping its
steepest weekly loss since March 22.  PTT Pcl (PTT) , the nation’s
largest company by market value, dropped 1.6 percent to the
lowest level in four months after oil declined.  Overseas  investors  sold a net 3.08 billion ($105 million)
of Thai equities yesterday, the biggest outflow since March 20,
according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. Thai stocks
erased losses yesterday after the nation’s anti-corruption
agency dismissed a case against Prime Minister Yingluck
Shinawatra and the central bank ruled out the possibility of
property-price controls.  “Sentiment in the Thai stock market is really subdued,”
Jitra Amornthum, the head of research at Finansa Syrus
Securities Pcl, said by phone today. “Local individual
investors are concerned that outflow of overseas funds may
accelerate.”  Some investors may also sell stocks ahead of the long
weekend break amid concerns about the widening bird flu
infections in  China  and tensions in the Korean peninsula, Jitra
said. Thai financial markets will be closed on April 8 for a
public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
