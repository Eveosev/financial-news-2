Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , the largest maker of
online social games, was sued by a shareholder after executives
were allowed to sell stock early for more than $200 million,
while sales by lower level employees and outsiders were blocked.  Wendy Lee, a former Zynga product manager, contended that
after a Dec. 16, 2011, initial public offering, substantially
all  shareholders , including all officers and directors, were
barred from selling shares for 165 days.  That “lockup” was waived the following March for some
executives, who sold more than 40 million shares in a secondary
offering, Lee said in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint made
public today in Wilmington.  While those higher-echelon officials were allowed “to cash
out early,” Zynga’s board “did not extend the same opportunity
to Zynga’s non-executive and former employees,” Lee said.  Executives “nearly doubled the proceeds from their sales”
by being allowed to sell early. By the time the lockup on other
investors expired, “Zynga’s share price had dropped 49.3
percent,” Lee said. She acquired 30,000 shares at $3.805 each,
and sold them at $3.15, according to court papers.  Stephanie Hess, a Zynga spokeswoman, declined to comment on
the lawsuit.  Lee’s suit came as San Francisco-based Zynga announced that
Chief Executive Officer  Mark Pincus  lowered his salary to $1 to
cut costs. His pay in 2011 totaled $1.68 million, according to
filings. Pincus founded Zynga in 2007.  Lee is seeking to proceed on behalf of non-executive
shareholders, and asked the court to order those who benefited
from early sales to pay damages.  Zynga rose 10 cents to $3.55 today in Nasdaq Stock Market
 trading . The shares had fallen 71 percent in the 12 months
before today.  The case is Lee v. Pincus, CA8458, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
