The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  against non-payment tumbled the most in seven months,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index slid 11 basis points to 95 as
of 9:29 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices. That
brings the gauge to its lowest level since before the record
earthquake that devastated the nationâ€™s northeast on March 11,
2011, according to data provider CMA. The measure is poised for
its lowest close since Nov. 29, 2010, and its biggest one-day
drop since Sept. 7, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 1 basis point to 119
as of 10:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking Corp.
prices. The benchmark has ranged from 102.3 basis points to
127.5 this year, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 121.5 basis points
as of 8:33 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The measure has ranged from 100.5 to 122.3 since
Dec. 31, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
