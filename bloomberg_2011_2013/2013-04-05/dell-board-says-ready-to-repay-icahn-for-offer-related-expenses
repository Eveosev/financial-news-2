Dell Inc. (DELL)  said it’s willing to
reimburse billionaire  Carl Icahn  for expenses he incurs in the
process of bidding for the computer maker.  Icahn is offering $15 a share in cash for as much as 58.1
percent of Dell’s stock, according to a March 25 statement.
Blackstone has offered to pay at least $14.25 a share to current
investors with an option to hold onto some of their stake
through a so-called equity stub.  The board, which has said it will seek the best possible
offer for the company, is reimbursing the expenses of potential
acquirers to encourage any and all bids. The bids by Icahn and
Blackstone may be superior to  Michael Dell  and Silver Lake’s
$24.4 billion buyout plan, putting more pressure on them to
sweeten their offer for the computer maker.  Dell’s board sent a letter to Icahn today in response to
his request for expense reimbursement, saying it was willing to
do so if he commits contractually to work “within our process”
and not threaten litigation or a proxy fight. It said the
reimbursement offer is under the same terms granted to
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and Silver Lake Management LLC.  Regardless of any decision by Icahn on this proposal,
Dell’s board said it would be willing to open the company’s
books to Icahn.  Michael Dell, who founded the PC provider in his Texas dorm
room in 1984, needs to ensure majority control so he can pursue
his plan to  retool  the struggling company as a maker of data-
center gear and software for corporations, without the scrutiny
of public investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
