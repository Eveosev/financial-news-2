Chile’s second-largest mobile
operator,  Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones SA , fell to a
five-month low after agreeing to a $400 million Peruvian
acquisition that will result in a dividend cut.  The company known as Entel retreated 1.8 percent to 9,628
peso at 11:20 a.m. in Santiago, the lowest level on a closing
basis since Oct. 12. The Ipsa benchmark index fell 0.8 percent.  Entel, based in Santiago, agreed to buy Nextel Peru, a unit
of Reston, Virginia-based  NII Holdings (NIHD)  Inc., according to a
 regulatory filing  yesterday. Entel said it will pay for the
acquisition partly by reducing its dividend payout to 50 percent
of profit. The payout ratio was previously 80 percent, according
to Banco Santander SA.  “While in the long run the acquisition might create value,
the short run is likely to be challenging,” Santander analyst
Nicolas Khaliliyeh said in an e-mailed note today. “We expect a
slightly negative market reaction.”  NII shares surged 12 percent in New York to $5.11.  Nextel Peru’s profit margins are lower than Entel’s, and
improving them will be a “major challenge,” Santiago-based
brokerage IM Trust SA said in an e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
