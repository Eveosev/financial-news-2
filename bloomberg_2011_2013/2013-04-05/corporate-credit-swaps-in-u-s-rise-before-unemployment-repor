A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk rose as investors awaited employment data in the worldâ€™s
biggest economy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, added 0.7
basis point to a mid-price of 88.6 basis points at 7:54 a.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Payrolls probably increased at a slower pace in March, a
Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  is expected
to show. Employers hired a net 190,000 workers last month after
taking on 236,000 in February, according to the median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The  jobless rate  remained
at 7.7 percent, the lowest since December 2008, the survey
showed.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
