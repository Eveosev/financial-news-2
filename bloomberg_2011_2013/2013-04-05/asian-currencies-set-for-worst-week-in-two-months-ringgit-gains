Asian currencies fell the most this
week since January as policy makers from the  Philippines  to
Japan proposed measures that tend to weaken their exchange rates.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said yesterday it would double monthly
bond buying to 7 trillion yen ($73 billion) to fight deflation
and South Korea’s presidential office signaled it favors lower
borrowing costs. The yen slumped to an August 2009 low today,
making its exports cheaper than those from Korea and Taiwan. The
Philippine central bank is considering steps to spur capital
outflows, Governor Amando Tetangco said this week, while data
signaled the  U.S. economy  is starting to cool.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index declined 0.2
percent since March 29, the most since the week ending Jan. 25.
South Korea’s won slumped 1.8 percent to a seven-month low of
1,131.69 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Philippine peso dropped 0.8 percent to 41.162 and India’s
rupee depreciated 1.1 percent to 54.885, the most in a month.  “ Japan ’s surprisingly big size of stimulus sparked a
strong bout of dollar buying,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a Seoul-
based currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. “Concerns over a
global economic recovery also weighed on emerging-market
currencies this week.”  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s most-
active currencies excluding the yen, has retreated 1.4 percent
from a 16-month high of 118.89 on Jan. 18.  Competing Exports  Taiwan’s central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan said March 28
that the island’s and Japanese exports are 38 percent similar,
compared with 83 percent for South Korean and Japanese shipments.  Manufacturing in the U.S. trailed economists’ forecasts in
March and unemployment in the euro-area held at a record 12
percent in February, official reports showed this week.
Employers in the world’s largest economy added 190,000 workers
last month versus 236,000 in February, according to a Bloomberg
survey before a Labor Department report today.  North Korea  said on April 3 that it will restart all
facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear site shut by a 2007
disarmament accord. Overseas funds pulled a net $625 million
from the Korean stock market this week through yesterday.  “Geopolitical risk from the North Korean threat is likely
to weigh on the won for an extended period of time,” said Suh Dae Il, an analyst at KDB Daewoo Securities Co. in  Seoul .  India’s rupee slid after the central bank said March 28
that the current-account  deficit  widened to a record $32.6
billion in the final quarter of 2012, from $22.6 billion in the
preceding three months.  Ringgit Rallies  Malaysia’s ringgit rallied 1.2 percent to 3.0570 per dollar
from March 29 after Prime Minister Najib Razak dissolved
parliament on April 3 and called for national elections. The
currency reached a seven-month low of 3.1395 on March 18.  “Elections are probably going to be held before the end of
April and we expect to see funds coming back,” said Wee-Khoon
Chong, a rates strategist in  Hong Kong  at Societe Generale SA.
“The risk-reward is still favoring the incumbent to continue
another term.”  Elsewhere in Asia,  China ’s  yuan  advanced 0.13 percent to
6.2030 per dollar and touched a 19-year high of 6.1986 on April
2 before markets closed for holidays yesterday and today.
Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.4 percent to 9753, Taiwan’s dollar
lost 0.2 percent to NT$29.925 and the  Thai baht  declined 0.1
percent to 29.31 per dollar. Vietnam’s dong was steady at 20,933.  To contact the reporters on this story:
