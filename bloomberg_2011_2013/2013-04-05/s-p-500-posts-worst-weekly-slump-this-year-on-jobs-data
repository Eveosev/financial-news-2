U.S. stocks  fell for the week,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the biggest drop this
year, as data on jobs, services industries and manufacturing
sparked concern the economic recovery may be slowing.  Energy and raw-materials producers declined at least 2.2
percent among 10 S&P 500 groups after commodity prices slumped.
Phillips 66 and Tesoro Corp. plunged more than 9.1 percent as
 refiners (S5OILR)  retreated amid a government proposal aimed at cutting
the sulfur in gasoline. Hewlett-Packard Co. tumbled 7.8 percent,
the most in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Humana Inc. surged
13 percent, leading gains among medical insurers, after the
industry won an increase in a key Medicare payment rate.  The S&P 500 slipped 1 percent to 1,553.28 over the five
days, after reaching a record close of 1,570.25 on April 2. The
Dow declined 13.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 14,565.25. The 30-
stock gauge capped its worst weekly loss in two months as data
showed the nation added less than half the number of jobs
economists forecast in March.  “The report confirms that belief that the market has been
driven up by monetary policy rather than better fundamentals and
therefore the market may well have to digest a slower pace of
economic growth from the year on,” David Pearl, who helps
manage $27 billion as co-chief investment officer at Epoch
Investment Partners Inc. in New York, said in a phone interview.  Economic Reports  Equities fell during the week as reports showed American
employers hired the fewest workers in nine months in March,
manufacturing expanded less than forecast and a gauge of U.S.
service industries fell more than economists’ estimates.  Among global economic reports, a Bank of  Japan  index showed
pessimism among large manufacturers and data on South Korean
exports and  China  factory output trailed forecasts. The BOJ
strengthened its stimulus program, while the European Central
Bank President Mario Draghi signaled the bank will keep monetary
policy loose for an extended period.  The  S&P 500 (SPX) ’s decline trimmed its gain for the year to 8.9
percent after the index added 10 percent in the first quarter.
The gauge has surged 130 percent from a 12-year low in 2009 as
companies reported better-than-estimated  earnings  and the
Federal Reserve embarked on three rounds of bond purchases to
stimulate the economy.  Alcoa Inc. unofficially kicks off the first-quarter
earnings season on April 8. Analysts project profits at S&P 500
companies fell 1.8 percent in the period, the first year-over-
year decrease since 2009, according to estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Analysts had predicted a 1.2 percent increase when
surveyed in January.  ‘Muted’ Expectations  “Expectations are muted,” Jeff Burchell, a fund manager
with Toronto-based Aston Hill Financial Inc., which oversees
C$6.74 billion ($6.63 billion) in North America, said in a phone
interview. “No one is expecting great growth across the board.
What we’ll see is OK to good earnings.”  Stocks of companies closely tied to economic growth led the
retreat for the week. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index fell the
most in 10 months, losing 3.3 percent. The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY) 
slumped 3 percent, its biggest slide since June.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against losses
in stocks, jumped 9.6 percent to 13.92. The gauge, known as the
VIX, is down 23 percent for the year.  Energy and raw-materials producers tumbled as the S&P GSCI
Index of 24  commodities  fell for six straight days, the longest
streak since May. Oil slumped 4.7 percent, capping its biggest
weekly drop in six months.  Halliburton Co., an oil services company, erased 4.5
percent to $38.60 and Chesapeake Energy Corp. declined 3.2
percent to $19.75. U.S. Steel Corp. slid 11 percent to $17.28
and Alcoa retreated 3.3 percent to $8.24.  Refiners Drop  Phillips 66, the largest U.S. independent refiner by
revenue since its spinoff from ConocoPhillips last year, dropped
11 percent to $62.31. Tesoro slid 9.1 percent to $53.24.  Refiners in the S&P 500 tumbled 9.2 percent as a group, the
worst slump since 2011. The Environmental Protection Agency
proposed rules aimed at cutting the sulfur in gasoline. The
changes will require an additional $10 billion in infrastructure
investment and $2.4 billion in annual operating costs, according
to the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group.  Computer and software makers  fell the most  among 10 S&P 500
groups, sinking 2.5 percent. Hewlett-Packard tumbled 7.8 percent
to $21.97 after an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
downgraded the shares. The company said Ray Lane is stepping
down as chairman and two other directors are leaving in the
second board overhaul in two years, underscoring shareholders’
dissatisfaction with the company’s performance.  Apple’s Apology  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  slipped 4.4 percent to $423.20. Chief Executive
Officer  Tim Cook  apologized for the company’s iPhone warranty
and repair policies in China after receiving criticism from
state-run media over customer service in its second-largest
market.  F5 Networks Inc. plunged 18 percent to $73.21 for the
biggest loss in the S&P 500. The maker of data-management
equipment reported preliminary quarterly profit and revenue that
missed its forecast as North American sales slowed.  Airlines fell, as the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index slumped
8.3 percent, the biggest weekly retreat since July. Delta Air
Lines Inc. plunged 13 percent, the most in almost two years, to
$14.39, while US Airways Group Inc. lost 7.4 percent to $15.72.  The two carriers during the week blamed congressionally
mandated budget cuts for shortfalls in a benchmark revenue gauge
in March. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said government spending on air
travel probably fell as much as 30 percent in the past month
amid so-called sequestration cuts.  Nasdaq’s Acquisition   Nasdaq (NDAQ)  OMX Group Inc. dropped 11 percent to $28.76. The
second-biggest operator of U.S. equity exchanges agreed to buy
eSpeed, an electronic platform for trading U.S. Treasury bonds,
for as much as $1.23 billion, depending on sales goals. Moody’s
Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s warned Nasdaq’s debt
rating may be lowered.  Medical insurers rallied after the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services decided to do away with a planned rate
reduction. Instead, insurers will receive a 3.3 percent increase
in the rate that determines the payments they get for running
the government’s Medicare Advantage plans.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. gained 8.6 percent to $62.10, the
highest level since 2006. Humana, the second-largest private
Medicare insurer, posted its biggest weekly gain since April
2009, adding 13 percent to $78.27.  Best Buy  Best Buy Co. surged 15 percent to $25.45. Samsung
Electronics Co., stepping up a battle with Apple, will staff
mini-stores at Best Buy’s U.S. locations to showcase how its
tablets, smartphones and televisions work together.  Facebook Inc. rose 7.1 percent to $27.39. The company
released software that makes it easier to access Facebook
features -- such as friends’ photos, messages and status updates
-- on a mobile device’s home screen.  While the  bull market  in U.S. equities entered its fifth
year last month, gains have been led by companies whose earnings
are less tied to economic swings.  Health-care (SPXL1) , consumer-staples
and utility stocks jumped more than 13 percent among S&P 500
groups so far in 2013. Cyclical stocks, including technology and
raw-materials producers, added no more than 1.7 percent as a
group.  Cheap Cyclicals  The rally in defensive stocks has driven the  price-to-
earnings  ratio for companies in the three groups to an average
16.9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compared
with the S&P 500’s multiple of 15.3 and exceeded the ratio of
14.8 for technology stocks and 15.7 for raw-materials producers,
the data show.  Cyclical stocks are now too cheap to pass on, said Epoch
Investment’s Pearl. His firm has recently added to holdings in
technology, industrial and raw-materials companies.  “Even if the market slows down, the valuation disparity is
so great that you could make money owning the economic sensitive
stocks because we’re still in a recovery,” he said. “It’s just
not a robust recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
