A shooting incident at a daycare in
Gatineau,  Quebec  has left two men dead, while none of the
children were harmed, police said.  Police evacuated all 53 children from two homes that make
up the daycare after shots were fired, Mario Harel, chief of
Gatineau Police, said in a briefing with reporters broadcast on
the RDI television network.  One man died on the scene, where a hunting rifle was found,
while the other died in the hospital, according to RDI. The
shooting was the culmination of a personal dispute, the
spokesman said.  Gatineau lies across the Ottawa River from  Canada â€™s capital
city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
