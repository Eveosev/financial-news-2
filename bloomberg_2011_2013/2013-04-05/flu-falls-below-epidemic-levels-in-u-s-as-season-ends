The annual flu season has ended in
the U.S., as the number of people seeing doctors because of the
virus or dying from it fell below epidemic levels last week, the
U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said.  About 1.8 percent of doctor visits during the week ended
March 30 were for complaints of influenza-like symptoms, such as
fever, coughs and sore throats, the agency said. That’s below
the national baseline of 2.2 percent. Influenza was responsible
for 7.4 percent of all deaths during the week, including one
child, less than the epidemic threshold, the CDC reported  The flu hit the U.S. earlier than normal this year, making
its entrance the third fastest in the past decade. Early fears
of a severe outbreak ebbed as the virus peaked, then plummeted,
according to the CDC’s weekly  Flu Tracker . One hundred and
eleven children died from influenza during the season, the
agency said.  The World Health Organization and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration have recommended the viruses that should be
included in the vaccine for the coming 2013-2014 season.  A new strain of bird flu that emerged in China has led to
six deaths, with authorities in Shanghai ordering the slaughter
of birds at a local market linked to the outbreak. There is no
evidence yet that the virus can move from person-to-person,
which would speed its spread, according to the World Health
Organization. There are 14 confirmed cases of the new H7N9
infection thus far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
