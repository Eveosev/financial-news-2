European stocks  slumped the most in
five months as U.S. employers hired fewer workers than forecast
and airline shares fell as a bird flu spread in  China .  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group and  International Consolidated
Airlines Group SA (IAG)  tumbled more than 6 percent amid speculation
the rising death toll from a new strain of bird flu in China
will hurt demand for travel. Daimler AG and Xstrata Plc paced a
selloff in carmakers and materials companies. National Bank of
Greece SA and Eurobank Ergasias SA sank more than 11 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  lost 1.5 percent to 287.23 at
4:31 p.m. in London, the largest decline since Oct. 23. The
gauge has retreated 2.2 percent this week, the most since
November, as U.S. reports on jobless-benefit claims and service-
industry growth also fell short of forecasts. The measure has
still climbed 2.7 percent this year.  Today’s jobs data provides a “little dose of realism,”
said Justin Urquhart Stewart, who helps oversee about $6.8
billion at Seven Investment Management Ltd. in  London . “If you
join the dots together, the economy is getting slower. There
will still be growth, but it’s at a lower, slower level.
Therefore, the market shouldn’t get too far ahead of itself.”  U.S. payrolls grew by 88,000 workers in March, the smallest
gain in nine months. That missed the median economist for an
advance of 190,000 in a Bloomberg Survey and followed a revised
268,000 increase in February.  Korea Concern  In  North Korea , the government asked  Russia  and other
states to consider evacuating their diplomats from the capital,
Pyongyang, as tensions mount with its southern neighbor. A
crisis is escalating after the communist nation threatened to
wage nuclear war on the U.S. and  South Korea .  Portuguese Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  faces a
Constitutional Court ruling on the legality of some elements in
this year’s budget that may challenge the government’s ability
to meet deficit targets. President Anibal Cavaco Silva and
various political groups asked the court in January to review
some points of the budget, including taxes on pensions.  No date is set for the ruling, and no one was immediately
available at the court’s press office to comment on reports in
Portuguese media including Expresso newspaper that the ruling
could be announced as soon as today.  “With the concerns that we have seen in  Europe , and now
 Korea , there are enough reasons to take home some profit,” said
Urquhart Stewart.  National benchmark indexes fell in all 18 markets in
western Europe today, except  Italy . Germany’s DAX retreated 2.1
percent and France’s CAC 40 declined 1.8 percent. The U.K.’s
 FTSE 100 (UKX)  slid 1.6 percent.  Airlines Decline  Air France lost 7.5 percent to 6.76 euros, leading a gauge
of  travel companies  in the Stoxx 600 to the biggest slump in
more than 18 months. As the death toll in China from the new
bird flu strain, known as H7N9, rose to six people, authorities
in  Shanghai  shut several poultry markets and culled birds in an
effort to contain the virus.  IAG sank 6.6 percent to 235.6 pence in London and  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  tumbled 5.1 percent to 14.16 euros in Frankfurt.  EasyJet Plc retreated 6 percent to 1,031 pence, the biggest
drop in 13 months, even as Europe’s second-largest discount
carrier cut its first-half pretax loss forecast amid a surge in
late bookings for Easter.  The world’s airlines suffered a $10 billion loss a decade
ago on the SARS outbreak that killed 774 people in 2002 and
2003. At the peak of the outbreak, carriers including including
Singapore Airlines and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific, cut more than
1,150 weekly flights.  Daimler Drops  Daimler paced a selloff in carmakers, dropping 2.3 percent
to 41 euros in  Frankfurt . Bayerische Motoren Werke AG declined
1.9 percent to 66.26 euros, while Renault SA slid 1.5 percent to
49.65 euros in Paris trading.  Basic-resources companies  also fell, sending an industry
gauge lower for a seventh straight week, the longest losing
streak in 13 years. ArcelorMittal retreated 3 percent to 9.23
euros, Xstrata Plc slid 3.3 percent to 1,016 pence and Glencore
International Plc dropped 3.2 percent to 337.55 pence.  National Bank of Greece slid 11 percent to 52 euro cents
and Eurobank plunged 21 percent to 15 cents, the lowest prices
ever in Bloomberg data going back at least 14 years. European
authorities will consider the impact on sovereign finances of
the Greek banks’ proposed merger, European Commission spokesman
Olivier Bailly said.  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  plummeted 7.2 percent to 207 pence, the
biggest decline in nine months, as Deutsche Bank AG downgraded
the U.K. gambling operator to hold from buy.  Telecom Italia  Telecom Italia SpA climbed 1 percent to 58.4 euro cents,
extending yesterday’s 7.8 percent advance, as the company said
it’s examining a possible merger with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.’s
Italian division, H3G SpA.  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. gained 3.4 percent to
243.2 pence as analysts at both UBS AG and Liberum Capital Ltd.
raised their recommendation for the mining company to buy. UBS
cited recent share price weakness while Liberum said capital-
raising concerns were now priced into the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
