Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index dropping to its lowest level since December on
concern an outbreak of bird flu that has killed six people in
 China  may cause an epidemic.  China Southern Airlines Co., Asia’s biggest carrier by
passenger numbers, plummeted 12 percent as the outbreak of avian
flu may limit travel to the region. China Resources Land Ltd.,
the second-biggest mainland property firm traded in Hong Kong,
dropped 4.8 percent as developers declined more than any other
index group. Techtronic Industries Co., a maker of power tools
that counts North America as its biggest market, slid 3.7
percent as U.S. jobless claims rose the most since November.  The Hang Seng Index slid 2.4 percent to 21,812.67 at 1:05
p.m. in Hong Kong. Only one stock rose on the 50-member gauge,
which is headed for a 2.2 percent weekly decline. The Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index of mainland shares retreated 2.8 percent
to 10,456.76. Hong Kong trading resumed after a public holiday
yesterday, while China’s markets are closed today.  “We are pretty much in a panic mode from a possible
epidemic from the new bird flu in China.” said Jackson Wong,
vice president at Hong Kong-based brokerage Tanrich Securities
Co., noting the selloff in Hong Kong was probably worsened
because Chinese markets are closed for a holiday. “Investors
cannot sell A-shares today so the only thing they can do is sell
their H-share counterparts.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 6.2 percent from Jan. 30 through
April 3 as China and Hong Kong stepped up measures to curb
property prices and Cyprus’s banking woes spurred concern that
 Europe ’s debt crisis is far from resolved.  Volume Swells  Volume on the benchmark Hang Seng Index was about 59
percent greater than the 30-day average for the time of day. The
gauge traded at 10.5 times estimated earnings, down from a
multiple of 11.6 on Jan. 30. That compares with 14.1 times for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.5 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Six people have died from a new strain of bird flu that
emerged in eastern China, and authorities detected the virus in
pigeon samples collected at a marketplace.  Shanghai , China’s
financial hub, has reported six of the 14 human cases of the
H7N9 strain of avian influenza confirmed by local authorities
since the country’s health ministry disclosed the first cases
last month, China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported
yesterday.  China Southern retreated 12 percent to HK$3.72. Air China
Ltd., Asia’s biggest carrier by market value, fell 11 percent to
HK$5.95.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , the Hong Kong-based
airline dropped 4.4 percent to HK$12.24.  Bird Flu  “If the bird flu continues to grow, no one will want to
take Chinese airlines,” Wong said of the moves. “That’s added
to the selling pressure.”  Developers led declines by industry groups on the benchmark
index on the avian flu threat and after billionaire investor
 George Soros  said China has a property bubble in an interview
with CNBC in Hong Kong today. China Resources Land slid 4.8
percent to HK$20.85. Country Garden Holdings Co., a Foshan-based
developer fell 5.2 percent to HK$3.81. Hang Lung Properties Ltd.,
the Hong Kong-based company investing more than $8.5 billion
building malls in mainland China, fell 3.7 percent to HK$29.05.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  slid 0.2 percent. The gauge
added 0.4 percent yesterday as central banks in  Japan  and Europe
reassured investors that they will keep economies awash in cash
to bolster growth.  U.S. Employment  U.S. jobless claims rose by 28,000 to 385,000 in the week
ended March 30, the highest since Nov. 24, Labor Department
figures showed yesterday. The median forecast of 47 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a drop to 353,000. A U.S.
government report today is forecast to show a gain of 190,000 in
U.S. payrolls last month, following a 236,000 advance in
February, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Techtronic slid 3.7 percent to HK$18.06. Li & Fung Ltd., a
supplier of clothes and toys to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target
Corp., fell 3.2 percent to HK$10.22.  Hang Seng Index futures slid 2.6 percent to 21,773. The  HSI
