Ukraine’s government  imposed  a quota
on imports of coking coal, used to make steel, and banned
inbound shipments of coke this year to aid domestic producers.  Coking-coal imports were set at 10.2 million metric tons
this year, according to a decree published today on the
cabinet’s website.  Local producers supply about 37 percent of the nation’s
coking coal, the  Interfax-Ukraine  news agency said, without
citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
