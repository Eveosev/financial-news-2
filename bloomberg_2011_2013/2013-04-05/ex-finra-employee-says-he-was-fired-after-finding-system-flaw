A former Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority employee filed a whistle-blower suit in
federal court, claiming he was fired after detecting a flaw in a
Finra’s risk-rating system that allowed large broker-dealers to
be over-leveraged.  Joseph Sciddurlo, 58, claimed in the suit filed today that
he worked as a principal examiner for Finra in 2010 when he
discovered that the regulator’s system allowed large firms to
circumvent a Securities and Exchange Commission rule limiting
leverage to 15 times net capital.  Sciddurlo was initially “commended for his financial
expertise and asked to design a better risk-rating methodology
with respect to broker-dealers,” he claimed in a complaint
filed in federal court in  Manhattan . Later, he was downgraded,
placed on probation and fired in May 2011, without a legitimate
reason, Sciddurlo said.  In the suit, Sciddurlo claimed Finra illegally
discriminated against him on the basis of age and fired him for
threatening to disclose the risk-rating flaw to other regulators
and to the public. He’s seeking at least $25 million in damages.  Michelle Ong, a spokeswoman for Washington-based Finra, had
no immediate comment on the suit.  The case is Sciddurlo v. Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, 13-cv-02272, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
