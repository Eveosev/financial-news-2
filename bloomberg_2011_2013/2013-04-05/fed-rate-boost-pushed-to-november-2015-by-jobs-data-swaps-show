Swaps traders have pushed back
expectations for the  Federal Reserve ’s first interest-rate
increase since adopting extraordinary monetary stimulus to about
November 2015 after a government report showed slower-than-
forecast jobs growth in March.  The forward rate on overnight index swaps, or OIS, for that
month is 38.6 basis points. That is the point where the market
is pricing in a 0.25 percentage point increase above the current
rate. The target range for the central bank’s effective funds
rate is zero to 25 basis points. A basis point equals 0.01
percentage point.  That compares with yesterday, when OIS showed July 2015 as
the likely date for a rate increase at 39.3 basis points. On
March 11, when the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield closed
at  2.06 percent , its high for 2013, the market was projecting a
rate increase for March 2015 with OIS priced at 45.3 basis
points.  “Today’s movement is significant because of the change in
expectations around the Fed because of the payrolls number,”
said Joe Abate, a strategist at Barclays Plc, one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the central bank.  Fed Measures  The Fed cut its benchmark rate for overnight loans between
banks to between zero and 25 basis points in December 2008 as
credit markets froze in the wake of the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The central bank purchased $2.3 trillion
of securities between November 2008 and June 2011, and currently
buys $85 billion of bonds a month to combat deflation concern
and stimulate investment in risk assets.  Ten-year  note yields  fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.69 percent at 1:21 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They touched 1.68
percent, the lowest level since Dec. 12.  Nonfarm payrolls grew by 88,000 workers last month, the
least in nine months, even as the  unemployment rate  declined to
7.6 percent, the Labor Department said. Economists had forecast
a 190,000-job gain and a steady jobless rate at 7.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
