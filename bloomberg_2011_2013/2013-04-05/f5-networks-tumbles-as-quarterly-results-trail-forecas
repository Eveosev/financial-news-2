F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV)  fell the most in
more than two years after the maker of data-management equipment
reported preliminary quarterly profit and revenue that missed
its  forecast  as North American sales slowed.  The  shares  slid 19 percent to $73.21 at the close in New
York, for the biggest one-day decrease since January 2011. They
have dropped 25 percent this year, as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index advanced 8.9 percent.  F5 Networks, which  counts  technology and telecommunications
companies among its customers, said sales in the latter segment
fell “significantly” during its second quarter that ended
March 31. Customer hesitancy prevented the Seattle-based company
from closing “certain forecasted deals,” Chief Executive
Officer John McAdam said on an earnings call yesterday.  “The slowdown in orders was pronounced in North America
and to a lesser extent EMEA while Asia-Pacific and  Japan  came in
roughly as planned,” McAdam said.  Preliminary  revenue  was $350.2 million, compared with the
company’s forecast of as much as $380 million, according to a
statement yesterday. Analysts had estimated an average of $375.8
million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Preliminary  profit  excluding expenses such as stock-based
compensation was $1.06 to $1.07 a share, the company said. F5
Networks had forecast as much as $1.24, and the average of
analysts’ estimates was $1.23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
