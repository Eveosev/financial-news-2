Thailand  plans to sell as much as 7
million metric tons of rice from inventories to fund a grain
purchase program, Commerce Minister Boonsong Teriyapirom said.  The grain from state reserves will be sold to foreign
governments and through auctions for domestic use and exports,
Boonsong told reporters in Nonthaburi province, outside Bangkok
today. Governments of  China ,  South Korea ,  Nigeria  and  South
Africa  have shown interest to buy grain, while the quantity and
timing of auctions will depend on prices, he said.  Stockpiles in Thailand jumped after Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra started buying from farmers in 2011, fulfilling an
election pledge to boost rural incomes. Rice, the staple for
half the world, has fallen 15 percent from a three-year high of
$18.54 per 100 pounds in September 2011 in Chicago as
inventories tracked by the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture
Organization swell to a record, curbing food costs.  “The key question is at what price the government will
sell,” said  Concepcion Calpe , the secretary of the United
Nations’ Food & Agriculture Organization’s inter-governmental
rice group. “If sold through tenders, the prices will have to
be substantially lower than those at which rice was purchased,
implying large losses to the Thai government.”  Global inventories advanced 7.2 percent to a record 173.11
million tons in 2012-2013 as production beats consumption for an
eighth season, according to the FAO. Milled reserves in Thailand
may jump 40 percent to 18.2 million tons in 2013, the agency
forecast in February. Thai rice exports tumbled 37 percent to
6.73 million tons in last calendar year, according to the
Ministry of Commerce.  Weaken Prices  “The government will have to subsidize,” said Samarendu
Mohanty, a senior economist at the Philippines-based
International Rice Research Institute. “It’s likely to weaken
global prices.”  Rough rice for delivery in May climbed 0.4 percent to
$15.730 per 100 pounds on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 6:27
p.m. in Bangkok. Futures have advanced 3.5 percent this year.  The Ministry of Commerce expects to return 180 billion baht
($6.1 billion) to the government through sale from stockpiles
and will not seek additional funds to continue the rice purchase
program in 2013-2014, Boonsong said.  “We will use proceeds from the rice sale as a revolving
fund for buying rice in the next crop,” Boonsong said. Losses
from the program may not exceed 80 billion baht a year, he said.  Thailand decided to extend rice purchase program for the
second harvest this year, maintaining purchase price for
unmilled white rice at 15,000 baht a ton, Spokesman Tossaporn
Serirak said March 31. The government has bought about 30
million tons of unmilled rice since the program started in
October 2011, government data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
