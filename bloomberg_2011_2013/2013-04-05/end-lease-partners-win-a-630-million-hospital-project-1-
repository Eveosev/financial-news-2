Lend Lease Group,  Australia ’s
biggest property developer, is among three companies selected to
develop a A$630 million ($656 million) hospital in Bendigo in
central Victoria state.  Lend Lease, its infrastructure development business Capella
Capital, services company Spotless Group Ltd. and engineering
company  Siemens AG (SIE) , based in Munich, will work with the state
government in a public-private partnership, Sydney-based Lend
Lease said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange
today.  The project follows successful bids for a 200 million euro
($259 million) hospital project in Treviso,  Italy , and the A$2
billion Sunshine Coast University Hospital in Queensland state
last year. Operating profit after tax at Lend Lease’s Australian
business rose 47 percent in the six months to Dec. 31.  Lend Lease will invest 50 percent of the equity in the
Bendigo hospital project alongside Siemens, it said today. The
372-bed hospital will have 10 operating theaters and a cancer
and mental health unit, it said.  Site works on the project will start in mid-2013 following
financial close in May, Lend Lease said.  Lend Lease shares rose 2 percent to A$10.30 at the close of
trading in Sydney, extending gains this year to 11 percent. That
compares with an increase of 5.2 percent in the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
