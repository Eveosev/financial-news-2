Gasoline and diesel on the  spot
market  in the U.S. Gulf Coast weakened as  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
prepared to resume fuel production at its Deer Park refinery in
Texas after a month-long turnaround.  The 340,000-barrel-a-day plant near Houston is restarting
units and is expected to be at full rates by as early as this
weekend, said a person with knowledge of the work, who asked not
to be identified because the information isnâ€™t public.  The refinery was scheduled to begin work March 4 on a crude
unit, coker and a sulfur recovery unit, a person with direct
knowledge of the schedule said Feb. 15.  Reformulated gasoline , or RBOB, in the region weakened by
0.62 cent to 7 cents a gallon less than futures on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 2:03 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The premium for  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the Gulf
shrunk by 0.25 cent to 0.5 cents a gallon more than Nymex
futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , fell 71 cents to $22.42 a
barrel. The same spread based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil rose
19 cents to $7.32 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
