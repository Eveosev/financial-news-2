Nigerian sovereign bonds were added
to a $1.7 trillion local-currency emerging-market index by
 Barclays Plc. (BARC)   Ten Nigerian bonds were included in the index on April 1,
Jodie Gray, a London-based spokeswoman for Barclays, said by e-
mail today. The debt has a weighting of 0.97 percent at
yesterday’s close, Gray said. Ten Romanian bonds were also
included in the gauge.  Barclays said in November it would add the two nations’
debt to the index after reviewing changes in marketplace and
polling investors on governance and market accessibility.
Eligibility criteria include having a minimum market size
equivalent of $5 billion, while each bond must have at least
$300 million outstanding and a minimum 12 months to maturity.  The addition follows Nigeria’s inclusion to JPMorgan Chase
& Co.’s emerging-market bond index series in October. JPMorgan
predicted adding the debt of Africa’s biggest oil producer to
its indexes would lure $1.5 billion to the West African nation.  Yields on Nigeria’s bonds due January 2022 have dropped 193
basis points, or 1.93 percentage point, to 10.91 percent since
the end of September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
