University of Louisville coach  Rick Pitino  would make $425,000 extra this year -- on top of a $5.7
million pay package -- by leading his favored Cardinals to the
championship of the men’s national basketball tournament.  Pitino’s bonus for winning the National Collegiate Athletic
Association title represents about 70 percent of the $600,000
annual salary that university President James Ramsey is getting
this year.  Pitino, 60, isn’t the only coach with a big payoff at
stake. Wichita State’s Gregg Marshall, who has a $1.25 million
salary, can make as much as $576,000 in bonuses for a national
title, while Michigan’s John Beilein, who earned $1.8 million
this season, can make as much as $175,000 extra.  “There is no fiscal sanity,” said Dave Ridpath, associate
professor of sports management at Ohio University in  Athens  and
president-elect of the Drake Group, a network of college
professors who advocate for academic integrity in sports. “You
are paid to coach and are expected to be competitive. Why are
you getting a bonus for doing something that is really
expected?”  Employment contracts were obtained by filing open records
requests with the universities. Syracuse, the other Final Four
team this year, is a private institution and not required by law
to provide employee contracts.  School representatives for Pitino, Beilein and Marshall
didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview. Ramsey was
traveling and unavailable.  Pitino has put Louisville in a position to win its first
NCAA basketball championship since 1986. Las Vegas oddsmakers
have made the Cardinals a 5-7 favorite to take the title,
meaning that a $7 wager would earn a bettor a $5 profit if
Louisville wins.  Research Spending  Ramsey became university president in 2002. By 2012, the
school had more than doubled spending on research to $196.4
million annually, increased its six-year graduation rate to 52
percent from 33 percent and almost doubled its  endowment  to
$724.4 million.  University professors started 49 companies, up from six,
the school has increased the number of endowed chairs and
professorships to 150 from 87, and has generated 1,346 patent
applications up from 259.  “He starts at 6:30 in the morning, you see him at an
alumni event at 10 p.m., and he never forgets a name,” Joe
Steffen, a biology professor who chairs Louisville’s faculty
senate, said in an interview. “What he’s done to grow this
university has been immeasurable. I’ve witnessed that from
behind the scenes.”  Pitino, now in his 12th season at Louisville, took over a
team that finished 12-19 in 2000-2001 and has led it to three
NCAA tournament semifinals.  Kentucky Championship  The only coach in NCAA history to take three different
schools -- Providence College,  Kentucky  and Louisville -- to the
NCAA tournament semifinals, he won a national championship with
Kentucky after the 1995-1996 season and lost the title game the
following year.  Pitino received $3 million in base pay this year and $2.7
million in deferred compensation that had been building since
2010. Had he left the school, he wouldn’t have received the
deferred payment, according to his contract.  Comparing the effect Pitino and Ramsey have on the
Kentucky-based school with 15,893 undergraduate students,
“Ramsey would win hands down,” Steffen said.  However, Pitino runs one of the money-making sports
programs at the school and is rewarded for it, he said.  “It sounds outlandish, but he can command that partly
because of market forces and partly because football and men’s
basketball generate the money to pay the bills for our other 20
athletic programs,” Steffen said.  Big East  Pitino earned bonuses of $50,000 each for winning the Big
East tournament and tying for the Big East regular-season title,
and another $175,000 for advancing to the NCAA semifinals. An
NCAA championship would add $150,000. He can earn additional
bonuses for academic achievement and coach of the year honors.  Ramsey received a base salary of $329,740 from the state
for serving as president, and an additional $270,260 in money
that was privately raised for running the University of
Louisville Foundation, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit that raises
and invests funds for university research, endowments and other
needs.  He can earn a bonus of $150,000 toward his retirement if he
reaches goals the trustee and foundation boards set for him, and
he can earn a retention bonus every two years of $500,000.  Ramsey turned down annual pay raises and bonuses from 2008
to 2010 and donated his 2011 bonus to the university.  To contact the reporter on this story:
