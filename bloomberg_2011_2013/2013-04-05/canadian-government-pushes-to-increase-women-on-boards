The Canadian government has created
an advisory council to push for an increase in the number of
women on corporate boards of directors.  “Businesses with more women on their boards are more
profitable and routinely outperform those with fewer,” Rona Ambrose, federal minister of public works and for the status of
women, said today in Toronto.  The 23-member council, which includes Linamar Corp Chief
Executive Officer Linda Hasenfratz,  TransAlta Corp. (TA)  CEO Dawn Farrell and former Deputy Prime Minister  John Manley , will make
recommendations in about six months on how best to influence
governance committees and increase diversity.  Other members of the council include Janet Ecker, president
of the Toronto Financial Services Alliance, Charles Winograd,
non-executive chairman of TMX Group Ltd. and former Canadian
auditor-general Sheila Fraser.  While sectors such as finance and telecommunications have
among the best representation of women on boards,  Canada ’s oil
gas and mining industries still lag, Ambrose said. Only 7
percent of mining and oil and gas companies have women
participating on boards, about half the national average, she
said.  “There are areas that do need to increase their
participation of women on corporate boards, but they also come
with realistic challenges,” Ambrose said in a telephone
interview.  Ambrose declined to name specific companies that are
lagging in the oil and gas and mining sectors. She said there
are about 800 women that are “board ready” to serve Canadian
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
