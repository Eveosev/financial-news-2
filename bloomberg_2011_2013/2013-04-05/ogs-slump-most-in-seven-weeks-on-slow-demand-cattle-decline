Hog futures fell, heading for the
biggest decline in seven weeks, on speculation slowing economic
growth will curb demand for U.S. pork. Cattle also dropped.  U.S. payrolls grew by 88,000 workers in March, the smallest
gain in nine months and less than the most-pessimistic forecast
in a Bloomberg survey, Labor Department data showed today. The
“disappointing” employment report doesn’t help meat demand,
said Doug Houghton, an analyst at Brock Associates.  “Everybody’s watching for the seasonal increase in demand,
and we’re really not seeing it yet,” Houghton said in a
telephone interview from  Milwaukee . “The pork supplies look
ample” compared to demand, he said.  Hog futures for June settlement declined 1.5 percent to
90.625 cents a pound at 9:43 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that level would be the biggest slump for a
most-active contract since Feb. 14. The commodity was up 7.3
percent this year through yesterday.  Cattle futures for June delivery slipped 0.3 percent to
$1.2205 a pound. A close at that level would leave prices down
1.9 percent this week.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement dropped 0.4
percent to $1.4535 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
