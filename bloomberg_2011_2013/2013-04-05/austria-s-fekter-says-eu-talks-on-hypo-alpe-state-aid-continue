Austria will continue European Union
talks on Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank International AG’s restructuring
plan, Finance Minister Maria Fekter said after a meeting with
the bloc’s top antitrust official.  Fekter told journalists in Brussels today she had a
“constructive” meeting with EU Competition Commissioner
 Joaquin Almunia  concerning the nationalized lender.  Fekter was seeking more time to sell Hypo Alpe assets in
Austria,  Italy  and the former  Yugoslavia , as well as
Kommunalkredit Austria AG, another nationalized bank, two people
familiar with the ministry’s plans said yesterday.  “We had an exchange on details with which we can now
continue to work,” Fekter said. “It was a very good discussion
and this will now be continued by experts.”  Hypo Alpe was nationalized in 2009 and has been supported
by the government with 1.76 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in
capital injections and additional bond guarantees. The aid
requires approval from Almunia.  Kommunalkredit, a municipal lender whose 2008 bailout has
cost taxpayers more than 2 billion euros, has to be sold by June
under the EU’s conditions for state aid approval.  Austria  had
until the end of March to report on its progress with the bank’s
privatization plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
