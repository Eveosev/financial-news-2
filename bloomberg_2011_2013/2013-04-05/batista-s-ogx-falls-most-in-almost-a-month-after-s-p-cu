OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes ,
the oil company controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , fell the
most in almost a month after a ratings cut by Standard & Poor’s.  OGX, based in Rio de Janeiro, dropped 14 percent to 1.71
reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest decline
since March 11. The shares tumbled 26 percent this week, the
 most  in the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index. Bonds due in 2018 fell
6.3 percent to 75.20 cents on the dollar, the lowest since March
27.  The explorer is producing a fraction of expected volumes at
its first oil project after it encountered more difficult
geology than it was expecting at the Tubarao Azul field off the
coast of Rio. The company will probably need to raise cash for
its 2014 investment program because production revenues don’t
cover costs, S&P said in an April 3 report. It lowered its
rating on OGX to B- from B and may cut it again this year.  The B- rating is six levels below investment grade and
indicates the company is vulnerable to adverse business,
financial and economic conditions.  OGX had $1.7 billion in cash at the end of 2013 and plans
to spend $1.3 billion this year, the company said in a March 26
earnings release. OGX may need to raise $1 billion from Batista
through a put option or sell assets to cover spending next year,
S&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
