(Corrects to say measure announced today will affect  tax
revenue  next year in second paragraph.)  Brazil ’s President  Dilma Rousseff 
has implemented a series of measures since taking office to
boost domestic demand and protect industry from imports.  April 4: Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  announces payroll tax
cuts for 14 additional sectors including transportation and
social communications. The measure will take effect next year
and reduce 2014 tax revenue by 5.4 billion reais ($2.7 billion).  The government also expands the number of companies that
can pay less tax by basing levies on profit expectations.  April 2: Rousseff publishes a presidential decree eliminating
the IOF tax on loans for the purchase, production and leasing of
capital goods.  Dyogo Oliveira, the finance ministry’s deputy executive
secretary, also announces the government is cutting 1.88 percent
of the IOF tax charged on private banks’ loans financed with 20
percent of some reserve requirements that were set aside to
stimulate infrastructure projects. Private banks will be able to
sell the portfolio of infrastructure loans to national
development bank BNDES, if desired.  April 1: The  finance ministry  extends until the end of the year
a tax cut on car sales that would have expired. The so-called
IPI tax on cars was scheduled to increase from 2 percent to 3.5
percent on April 1. The measure will cost the government 2.2
billion reais ($1.1 billion) in tax revenue from April to
December.  March 9: Rousseff announces the elimination of the 9.25 percent
PIS/Cofins taxes on staple foods. The measure, which will reduce
tax revenue by 7.3 billion reais annually, is intended to
increase consumption of food and other goods while helping to
boost economic growth. Rousseff also eliminated the IPI tax for
soap and sugar.  Dec. 27, 2012: Brazil’s central bank eases  reserve requirements 
on large banks. Banks with a minimum of 6 billion reais in total
equity that provide credit for capital-goods investment may
deduct as much as 20 percent of reserve requirements for their
so-called “on call” deposits that can be withdrawn at any
time.  Dec. 24, 2012: Rousseff’s Cabinet chief Gleisi Hoffmann
announces reduction of taxes on income from profit sharing
programs.  Dec. 19, 2012: Mantega announces the extension of IPI tax cuts
for automobiles, furniture, appliances and other goods through
June, though at lower levels. Tax cuts for automobiles will ease
gradually from January to June, and in February for other goods.
Tax cuts for some goods, such as trucks and washing machines,
will remain in place.  Mantega also announces that retailers, excluding
supermarkets, will be exempt from payroll taxes starting in
April. This brings the number of sectors receiving the tax
benefit to 42.  Dec. 18, 2012: The central bank eases reserve requirements on
short dollar positions. Financial institutions will be required
to collect reserve requirements on short dollar positions above
$3 billion, up from the previous $1 billion level.  Dec. 6, 2012: Ports Secretary Leonidas Cristino announces a plan
to increase private investment in the port system. The plan
entails a new regulatory framework and investment of 54.2
billion reais through 2017, and includes a line of financing for
port investments at the long-term lending rate, known as TJLP,
plus up to 2.5 percent with a three-year grace period. The ports
of Manaus, Porto Sul,  Espirito Santo , Ilheus and Imbituba will
be offered for private concession.  Dec 5, 2012: Mantega announces that state development bank BNDES
in January will cut its TJLP lending rate to 5 percent from 5.5
percent. He also says BNDES will extend for another year by 100
billion reais an emergency credit line established during the
2009 credit freeze to fund the purchase of capital goods.
Private banks can join the lending program by counting up to 15
billion reais in loans against deposits they’re required to hold
at the central bank.  The central bank reduces the maturity of foreign loans
subject to a 6 percent tax to one year from two years.  Dec. 4, 2012: Mantega announces exemption of payroll tax and
reduction of other taxes for civil construction. The tax relief
for the sector totals 2.85 billion reais annually and the

on loans under advanced payment agreements if they mature within
5 years.  Oct. 24, 2012: Rousseff announces an extension until year-end
