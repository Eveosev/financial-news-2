Natural gas futures in New York
surged the most in four months, settling at a 20-month high, as
cold weather helped erase a stockpile surplus and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. raised its 2013 gas price forecast.  Gas jumped 4.5 percent, the biggest one-day gain since Dec.
5, as MDA Weather Services predicted below-normal temperatures
in north-central states next week while  Texas  and the Southeast
will see hotter-than-normal readings April 15-19. Unusually cold
March weather  pushed supplies  below the five-year average for
the first time since 2011, and prompted Goldman Sachs to
increased its price outlook by 17 percent.  “We have a little Friday surprise by Goldman,” said  John Woods , president of JJ Woods Associates and a Nymex floor trader
in New York. “This market does have the potential to move
upward. We have an extended period of cold weather and it has
taken away the surplus we had.”  Natural gas for May delivery rose 17.8 cents to $4.125 per
million Btu on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement price since August 2, 2011. Volume was more than
double the 100-day average at 2:39 p.m.  The futures climbed 2.5 percent this week, the seventh
straight weekly increase, the longest such streak since the
period ended Oct. 30, 2009. Prices are up 23 percent this year.  The discount of May contracts to October narrowed 2.9 cents
to 8.9 cents, the least for this time of the year for comparable
contracts since 2003.  Rigs Decline  Price gains accelerated after Baker Hughes Inc. said the
number of  rigs drilling  for gas fell to the lowest level since
May 1999. The count tumbled 14 this week to 375.  “The cold weather in March means the 2012/13 winter will
end up in line with historical averages, despite the mild
weather in December,” Johan Spetz, an analyst with Goldman
Sachs in New York, said in a report dated yesterday. Spetz
raised his estimate for gas prices this year by 65 cents to an
average $4.40 per million Btu.  The tightening supply-and-demand balance means prices will
have to move higher in the second half of the year to spur
production growth after the summer, he said. “We now expect
prices will need to average $4.50 per million Btu in the second
half of 2013 to bring on the production growth required to
balance the market.”  Goldman recommends buying $4.20  call options  on November
2013 gas futures, which at the time of the report’s publication
were valued at 31 cents, Spetz said.  Options Volatility  May $3.80 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They slipped 2.8 cents to 1.6 cents per
million Btu on volume of 2,250 contracts as of 3:02 p.m. Puts
accounted for 61 percent of options volume.  Implied volatility for at-the-money gas options expiring in
May was 28.68 percent at 2:45 p.m., up from 27.06 percent
yesterday. June options volatility was 27.84 percent, up from
26.53 percent.  MDA forecasts show that unusually cold weather in the parts
of the Midwest next week will shift westward by the middle of
the month while the eastern half of the lower 48 states heats
up. The average temperature in Minneapolis on April  The low temperature in  Chicago  on April 12 may be 35
degrees Fahrenheit (2 Celsius), 6 below normal, with a high of
54 degrees, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
 Pennsylvania . By contrast the high in  Dallas  may rise to 82
degrees on April 15, 5 above normal.  ‘Bull’s Dream’  “You’ve got winter and summer at the same time, which is a
natural gas bull’s dream and a natural gas bear’s nightmare,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
Chicago. “The fact that storage is below the five-year average,
you are going to see prices go up.”  U.S. stockpiles fell by 94 billion cubic feet to 1.687
trillion cubic feet during the week ended March 29, bucking the
five-year average change for period of an increase of 4 billion,
the Energy Information Administration said yesterday. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a decline of 91 billion.  Supplies were 2.1 percent below the five-year average for
the week, posting a deficit against the historical norm for the
first time since August 2011, according to data from the Energy
Department’s statistical unit. A  deficit  versus year-earlier
levels widened to 32 percent from 27 percent the previous week,
the most in EIA records going back to 2005.  Stockpile Outlook  The next two EIA supply reports may show drawdowns in gas
stockpiles before they begin to build up again, said Woods. His
early estimate for next week is a drop of 20 billion based on
this week’s cold snap. The five-year average change is a gain of
15 billion, government estimates show.  Inventories typically start to increase from April through
October to prepare for the next heating season, the peak months
for U.S. gas consumption.  Spetz sees supplies at the end of October peaking at 3.65
trillion cubic feet, which EIA data shows would be the  lowest
level  for the time of year since 2008.  U.S. marketed production in 2013 will increase 0.7 percent
to a record 69.6 billion cubic feet a day, the slowest pace of
growth in eight years, the EIA said in its March 12 monthly
 Short-Term Energy Outlook .  To contact the reporters on this story:
