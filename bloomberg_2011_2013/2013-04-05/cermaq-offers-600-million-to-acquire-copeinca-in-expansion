Cermaq ASA (CEQ) , a Norwegian state-
controlled fish farming company, offered to buy  Copeinca ASA (COP)  for
3.49 billion kroner ($600 million) as it expands in  Peru .  The company secured control of more than 50 percent of the
shares and will make a voluntary offer for the remainder, Cermaq
said in a statment today. The offer of 59.7 kroner a share was
accepted by shareholders holding 22.7 million stocks and will be
paid 40 percent in cash and 60 percent in shares.  “This transaction, when completed, will strengthen
Cermaq’s position as an integrated marine protein company with a
significant global market position in marine raw materials
which are essential for the salmon industry” Chief Executive
Officer Jon Hindar said in the statement.  The combined company is expected to benefit from annual
synergies in the range of 250 million kroner to 270 million
kroner and the deal is expected to be “accretive” to earnings
per share in 2013, the company said. Copeinca had sales of $314
million last year and operating profit of $75 million.  Cermaq also purchased 11.7 million Copeinca shares through
a directed issue of new shares, as well 852,993 Treasury shares,
giving it control of 50.7 percent of the share capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
