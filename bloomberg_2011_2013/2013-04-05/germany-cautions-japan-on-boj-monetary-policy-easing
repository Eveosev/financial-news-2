The  Bank of Japan ’s move toward
record monetary easing can’t be a substitute for government
policies to overhaul the economy, German Finance Ministry
spokesman Martin Kotthaus told reporters in Berlin today.  Japan  in a Group of 20 accord has agreed to “avoid
anything in which one uses monetary policy to gain any economic
or export advantages,” Kotthaus said at a regular government
press conference when asked to comment on BOJ policy.  “Monetary policy can indeed be used to achieve certain
things, but can never be a substitute for structural reforms,”
Kotthaus said. “And the Japanese have already said that they
will decisively tackle the necessary reforms in their country,”
which is to be welcomed, Kotthaus said.  The BOJ said it will double the monetary base by the end of
2014 through purchases of  government bonds  in Japan’s biggest
round of asset purchases. The yen dropped to 97.19 per dollar,
the lowest since 2009, before trading at 96.22 as of 1:20 p.m.
in Berlin.  “I do believe that the international orientation, the
joint international decisions on that matter, are quite clear,”
Kotthaus said. “Reforms must be made,  monetary policy  can’t be
a substitute.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
