Gold fell for a fourth day, nearing
its first  bear market  since 2008, as investors reduced asset
holdings amid optimism a global economic recovery will curb
haven demand. Silver traded near an eight-month low.  Gold for immediate delivery declined as much as 0.3 percent
to $1,549.62 an ounce and was at $1,551.08 at 2:10 p.m. in
Singapore. Prices touched $1,540.29 yesterday, the lowest since
May 30, and are set for a second weekly drop. Bullion tumbled
18.4 percent from a record close of $1,900.23 in September 2011,
nearing the 20 percent that typically defines a bear market.  Holdings of gold-backed  exchange-traded  products have
contracted 7.5 percent this year to the lowest level since
August, data compiled by Bloomberg show. If ETPs outflows gain
momentum, prices are likely to struggle in the coming sessions
until a new catalyst emerges, Barclays Plc said yesterday. A
 bull market  in  equities  entered its fifth year last month, with
the  S&P 500  more than doubling from its bottom in 2009.  “There seems to be an overarching sense of complacency
about the world economic picture,” said  Gavin Wendt , a director
at Mine Life Pty. in Sydney. “There’s a pervading view that
gold’s run is over, get out of gold and start putting your money
into the share market.”  Gold ETPs stood at 2,435.35 metric tons yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Standard & Poor’s
500  Index (SPX)  rose to a record on April 2, after rallying 10 percent
in the first quarter as gold dropped 4.6 percent.  Bond Buying  Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  said yesterday
that the U.S. central bank should be prepared to alter its $85
billion monthly pace of bond buying based on changes in the
economic outlook. That supports a proposal by St. Louis Fed
President  James Bullard  to reduce the pace of purchases as the
economy improves or expand it if the economy weakens. Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said last month policy makers are considering
this strategy to “appropriately calibrate” its policy.  Gold for June delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,549.70 an
ounce on the Comex in  New York . Prices dropped to $1,539.40
yesterday, the lowest for a most-active contract since May 30.  Spot silver fell as much as 0.6 percent to $26.7925 an
ounce, set for a fourth weekly slump, and was at $26.8188.
Prices touched 26.6488 yesterday, the cheapest since July 24.  Platinum was little changed at $1,522.50 an ounce, poised
for a fourth weekly decline. Palladium gained 0.3 percent to
$729.05 an ounce, set for a weekly drop.  To contact the reporter for this story:
