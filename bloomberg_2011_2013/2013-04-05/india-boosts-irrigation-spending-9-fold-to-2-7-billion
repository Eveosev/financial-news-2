India , the second-biggest producer
of rice and wheat, plans to increase spending on irrigation
projects to boost water supplies to farms nine-fold to 150
billion rupees ($2.7 billion) over the next five years.  The south Asian country will also build additional micro-
irrigation projects and canals by 2017 to ensure more efficient
use of water, G. Mohan Kumar, special secretary in the ministry
of water resources, said today in New Delhi.  About six percent of the 60 million hectares of irrigated
farmland in India has drip and sprinkler equipment, according to
 Jain Irrigation Ltd. (JI) , Asiaâ€™s biggest irrigation-equipment maker.
Eighty percent of the water available in India is used in
agriculture and less than 10 percent by factories, Kumar said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
