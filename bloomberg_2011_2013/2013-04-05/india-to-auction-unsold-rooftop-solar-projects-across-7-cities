India , which plans to raise solar
capacity eightfold by 2017, will auction projects for setting up
grid-connected photovoltaic systems on rooftops across seven
cities in the next two weeks.  The government received bids for half the planned 10
megawatts of rooftop solar capacity in the first round that was
completed on April 3, prompting the sale of unsold capacities,
said Tarun Kapoor, joint secretary at the ministry of New and
 Renewable Energy , in a phone interview today.  Azure Power India Pvt.,  Thermax Ltd. (TMX)  and SEI Green
Technology Pvt. won contracts to set up a total 5 megawatts of
rooftop photovoltaic capacity across the cities of Bangalore,
Chennai, New Delhi and Gurgaon, according to a ministry
 statement .  The government will seek bids for unsold capacities in the
first round and for similar projects in Hyderabad, Jaipur and
Greater Noida, Kapoor said.  In December, India said it will set up 9,000 megawatts of
grid-connected solar plants by 2017, more than eight times its
current capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
