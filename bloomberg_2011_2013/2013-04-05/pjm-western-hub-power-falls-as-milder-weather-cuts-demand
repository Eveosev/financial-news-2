Wholesale electricity on the eastern
U.S. grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC slid for the first
time on five days as a cold snap gave way to milder weather.  Spot prices covering on-peak hours dropped 31 percent, the
most since March 19. The operator of the 13-state grid
stretching from  New Jersey  into  North Carolina  and Illinois
predicted a drop in demand today. Temperatures will be more
seasonal across the region following lower-than-normal readings
earlier in the week, according to AccuWeather Inc.  Electricity at PJM’s benchmark Western Hub, which includes
prices from  Pennsylvania  to  Washington , fell $18.19, or 33
percent, to $37.76 a megawatt-hour at 2:15 p.m. from yesterday’s
on-peak average, according to the grid operator. On-peak hours
run from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.  The high today in Washington may be 63 degrees Fahrenheit
(17 Celsius), 1 below normal, compared with yesterday’s high of
50 degrees, 11 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College , Pennsylvania.  PJM predicted  power usage  across the grid would peak during
the hour ended at 9 a.m. Demand rose to 95,834 megawatts at 8:10
a.m., 6.2 percent lower than yesterday’s peak of 102,182
megawatts.  Spot power gained in  New York  and New England.  New York City prices increased for the fourth time this
week, rising $6.70, or 16 percent, to $48.19 a megawatt-hour
from yesterday’s on-peak average, according to the  New York
Independent System Operator Inc.   On-peak prices  on the six-state grid from Connecticut to
Maine rose $12.12, or 32 percent, to $53.93 a megawatt-hour from
the previous day’s average, the first gain in three days, ISO
New England Inc. data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
