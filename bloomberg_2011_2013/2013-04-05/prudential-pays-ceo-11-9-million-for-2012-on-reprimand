Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer by market value, paid Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam 7.8 million pounds ($11.9 million) in 2012 even after he
was reprimanded by the British regulator.  Thiam, 50, received a 1 million-pound salary, 2 million
pounds in bonus and 4.4 million pounds in long-term incentives
for performance periods ending in Dec. 31, 2012, London-based
Prudential said today in its annual report. The firm paid its
directors 35.2 million pounds last year compared with 31.4
million pounds in 2011, it said.  The Ivory Coast-born French national last week became the
first serving CEO of a  FTSE 100 (UKX)  company to receive a public
reprimand from the U.K. regulator for not informing it of the
insurer’s $35.5 billion bid for  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  early enough in
2010. Prudential was fined 30 million pounds. The insurer, which
competes with AIA selling  life insurance  in  Asia , has risen
almost  90 percent  in London trading since the deal failed three
years ago as Thiam boosted sales, profits and dividends.  “The excellent results delivered in 2012 build on strong
financial performance over recent years,” Andrew Turnbull,
chairman of Prudential’s remuneration committee, wrote in the
report. “This has generated significant returns for
shareholders over the period 2010 to 2012 through share price
growth and dividends paid.”  The firm’s 2010 performance share plan will be paid in
full, Turnbull wrote.  Prudential’s operating profit rose 25 percent to 2.53
billion pounds in 2012, beating analyst estimates, on higher
earnings in Asian countries such as Indonesia, Singapore and
Malaysia. Thiam raised the company’s full-year dividend 16
percent to 29.19 pence a share. That’s 53 percent more than when
he joined the firm in 2009.  The firm’s U.S. CEO Mike Wells was the second-highest paid
director after Thiam in 2012, receiving 6.6 million pounds, with
almost half in long-term incentives.  Michael McLintock , CEO of
Prudential’s fund management arm, M&G, received 5.3 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
