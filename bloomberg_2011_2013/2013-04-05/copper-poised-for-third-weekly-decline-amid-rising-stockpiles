Copper traded near an eight-month
low, poised for a third weekly drop, on concern that growth is
slowing in  China , the biggest user, and as global inventories
continued to climb.  Metal for delivery in three months fell 0.2 percent to
$7,428.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 11:03 a.m.
in Seoul. Prices are down 1.5 percent this week and yesterday
touched the lowest since Aug. 3. Futures for May delivery were
little changed at $3.3555 a pound on the Comex in  New York .
Markets in China are closed today for a national holiday.  Inventories tracked by the LME rose for a 34th session to
579,175 tons, daily exchange figures showed. That’s the most
metal since October 2003. Reports this week showed an official
gauge of Chinese manufacturing for March came in lower than
analysts forecast, while euro-area services output shrank more
than initially estimated last month.  “Questions about growth in China and continued problems in
 Europe  will likely cap gains for now,”  RBC Capital Markets  said
in a report e-mailed today. “Falling bonded warehouse stocks of
copper along with rising physical premiums in China will likely
prove supportive through the second quarter.”  Stockpiles in bonded warehouses in China will fall by
80,000 to 100,000 tons in April, Macquarie Group Ltd. said in e-
mailed report on April 4. Prices won’t fall sustainably below
$7,000 a ton until 2014, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in an e-
mailed report today.  Workers at Chilean copper mines owned by BHP Billiton Ltd.
and Anglo American Plc are preparing protests to push for
greater  job security  at a time when a strike at a port is
restricting exports by 60 percent after Angamos port workers
started protests March 16.  On the LME, lead and nickel rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
