Google Inc. (GOOG)  is returning the
Frommer’s travel-guide brand to its founder, while keeping the
other content it acquired from publisher  John Wiley & Sons Inc. (JW/A) 
in August.  Google, the world’s largest Internet-search engine,
acquired Frommer’s last year, adding about 350 travel guides and
the Frommers.com travel-planning website. Terms of the deal
weren’t disclosed at the time.  The content from Frommer’s, which has been integrated with
Google’s services, will be retained, Google said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. The search provider is offering more of its
own content to Web surfers by adding information on hotels and
restaurants around the world, a bid to attract users and
advertisers from sites such as  Yelp Inc. (YELP)  and  TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP)   “We’re focused on providing high-quality local information
to help people quickly discover and share great places, like a
nearby restaurant or the perfect vacation destination,” Google
said. “That’s why we’ve spent the last several months
integrating the travel content we acquired from Wiley.”  Founder Arthur Frommer will license “certain travel
content” from Google, the company said. Google also bought
restaurant-guide publisher Zagat Survey LLC in 2011, integrating
it with its own social network, Google+.  Google shares declined 1.4 percent to $795.07 at
yesterday’s close in  New York . The stock has gained 12 percent
this year. TripAdvisor rose less than 1 percent to $49.52 and
Yelp climbed 2.7 percent to $23.67.  To contact the reporter on this story:
