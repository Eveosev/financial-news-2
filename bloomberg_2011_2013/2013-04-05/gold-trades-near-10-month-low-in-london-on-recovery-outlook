Gold traded near a 10-month low in
London on mounting confidence the global economy is
strengthening and as investors awaited U.S. jobs data. Silver
was near its lowest since July.  A Labor Department report today will probably show U.S.
payrolls increased in March, economists said. Gold is down 7.4
percent this year as global equities trade about 2 percent below
a more than four-year high. Bullion is set for the biggest
weekly drop in seven and is nearing a bear market even as the
 Bank of Japan (8301)  yesterday increased bond purchases and European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned that he sees risks to
 Europe ’s recovery.  “The bearish market sentiment feels much more severe than
the actual decline in prices,” Joni Teves, an analyst at UBS AG
in London, wrote today in a report. “Today, the focus is on
March U.S. nonfarm payrolls. The threat for gold is that a
strong print would give enough ammunition to the market for
another push lower. A significantly weaker-than-expected
employment number could also spark a powerful upside response.”  Gold for immediate delivery lost 0.2 percent to $1,551.48
an ounce by 9:40 a.m. in London. It reached $1,540.29 yesterday,
the lowest since May 30, and is down 3 percent this week.
Futures for June delivery were little changed at $1,551 on the
Comex in New York. Futures trading volume was 37 percent below
the average in the past 100 days for this time of day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bullion slipped this year after 12 straight annual gains as
Federal Reserve policy makers debated the pace of stimulus. A
close at $1,520.18 in  London  would be a 20 percent drop from the
peak reached in September 2011, the common definition of a bear
market.  Jobs Data  Today’s nonfarm payrolls data may show U.S. employers hired
a net 190,000 workers last month and the unemployment rate held
at a four-year low of 7.7 percent, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Payrolls rose 236,000 in February.  Silver for immediate delivery lost 0.3 percent to $26.8869
an ounce in London, after reaching $26.65 yesterday, the lowest
since July 24. Prices entered a bear market this week and are
down 11 percent this year. Palladium added 0.1 percent to
$728.28 an ounce, after dropping to a more than four-week low of
$722.73 yesterday. Platinum was 0.3 percent higher at $1,527.60
an ounce. It reached $1,509.60 yesterday, the lowest since
August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
