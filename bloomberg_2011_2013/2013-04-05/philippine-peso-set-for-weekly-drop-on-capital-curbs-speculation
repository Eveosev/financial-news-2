The Philippine peso headed for its
biggest weekly drop since August on speculation policy makers
will tighten measures to curb capital inflows.  Government bonds 
rose after inflation unexpectedly slowed last month.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said
today the central bank will monitor fund flows, especially after
the nation was raised to investment grade by  Fitch Ratings  last
week. The monetary authority will probably relax rules on
foreign-currency transactions this month to encourage outflows,
he said on April 2. Global investors bought $1 billion more
local stocks than they sold this year, compared with $430
million in the same period of 2012, and the currency is 4
percent stronger than it was 12 months ago.  “Worries about further capital-inflow measures is one of
the factors dragging the peso lower,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a
strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “In the short
term, the peso should hover around current levels.”  The peso fell 0.8 percent this week to 41.162 per dollar as
of 4:10 p.m. in Manila, the biggest loss since the five days
ended Aug. 17, Tullett Prebon Plc prices showed. It was little
changed today and touched 41.235 earlier, the weakest level
since Dec. 27.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, surged 77 basis points,
or 0.77 percentage point, this week to 4.55 percent.  Consumer prices  gained 3.2 percent from a year earlier,
official data showed today, while the median forecast of
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  was for a repeat of
February’s 3.4 percent increase.  The yield on the 9.125 percent notes due September 2016
decreased eight basis points to 2.53 percent today, according to
Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
