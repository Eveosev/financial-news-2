Temperatures in the eastern U.S. are
expected to rise by mid-April,  MDA Weather Services  said.  From  New Hampshire  to Florida and as far west as Texas,
temperatures are expected to be 5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to
4 Celsius) above normal from April 15 to 19, while cooler air
dominates the West, said MDA, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  April, the first full month of the Northern Hemisphere
spring, is the start of a transition to warmer weather, when
more energy is used to cool, rather than heat, homes. Until heat
builds in the summer, the impact of the weather on energy prices
is less noticeable. About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas
for warmth.  The area from  Arkansas  eastward through Tennessee and into
the mid-Atlantic states, including the cities of Washington,
Baltimore and Philadelphia, may have temperatures 8 to 14
degrees above normal in April 15 to 19, MDA said.  Temperatures in the Pacific Northwest and western Canada
may drop to 3 to 4 degrees below normal, with readings in
Alberta  8 to 14 degrees lower than the 30-year average.  The normal average temperature on April 11 in  New York City 
is 51 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius), according to MDA. In
Boston, itâ€™s 47; in Chicago, 47; in Houston, 69; in  St. Louis ,
56; and in Burbank,  California , 62.  To contact the reporter on this story:
