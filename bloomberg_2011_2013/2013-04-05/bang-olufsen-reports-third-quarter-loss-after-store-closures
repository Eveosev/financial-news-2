Bang & Olufsen A/S (BO)  reiterated it
will lose money this financial year as the Danish maker of
luxury stereos and television sets reported a third-quarter loss
after store closures and weak demand in  Europe .  Bang & Olufsen reported a net loss of 90.7 million kroner
($15.7 million) in the three months through February, compared
with a profit of 17 million kroner in the same period a year
earlier, the Struer, Denmark-based company said in a statement
today. Analysts had estimated a loss of 87.7 million kroner,
according to a survey compiled by Bloomberg.  The company is in the second year of a five-year plan that
aims to triple revenue and restore profitability to levels from
before the financial crisis by closing stores in Europe and
expanding in  emerging markets . Third-quarter sales declined to
654.6 million kroner from 766.3 million kroner and the gross
margin fell to 34.9 percent from 38.3 percent as capacity costs
jumped 27 percent to 343 million kroner.  “The quarter was negatively impacted by the accelerated
transformation of our retail network, as we transition to fewer,
more productive stores in Europe,” Bang & Olufsen Chief
Executive Officer Tue Mantoni said in a statement.  Bang & Olufsen repeated the outlook it gave on March 22,
when it warned it will post a loss as wide as 200 million kroner
before interest and tax in its fiscal year that ends May 31. The
company today also said that John Bennett-Therkildsen, head of
operations, will retire next summer and be replaced by Folkert
Boelger, who is currently head of global procurement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
