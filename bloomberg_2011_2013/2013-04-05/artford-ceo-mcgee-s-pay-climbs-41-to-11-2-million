Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG)  Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee’s compensation climbed
41 percent last year as the insurer’s stock rebounded.  Compensation was $11.2 million, including a bonus of $2.35
million, compared with $7.94 million in 2011 when he got no
award from the incentive plan, according to a regulatory filing
today from Hartford, which is based in the Connecticut city of
the same name.  McGee has been retreating from life coverage and annuities
to limit risks tied to equity markets and interest rates, and
has been narrowing the company’s focus on property-casualty
coverage and group benefits. The stock rallied 38 percent in
2012 after dropping 39 percent a year earlier.  “Mr. McGee demonstrated strong leadership by taking bold
actions to reposition the company for future growth and long-
term shareholder value creation,” Hartford said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
