     April 5 (Bloomberg) --Japanese stocks surged, with the

two years, after Haruhiko Kuroda announced unprecedented
stimulus in his first policy meeting as Bank of  Japan  governor.  Real-estate shares climbed the most among the 33 Topix

said Ryota Sakagami, chief strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities
in Tokyo. “The  Bank of Japan (8301)  and the government are working
together to push up asset prices. The BOJ has given the
impression that it will act if the market were to go down, so it
doesn’t look like there will be a correction.”  The Nikkei 225 has rallied 48 percent since mid-November,
the biggest jump among major equity gauges, amid bets policy
makers would make good on Kuroda’s pledge to do “whatever it
takes” to beat deflation. The advance has increased the  value
