Cia. de Saneamento do Parana  will
develop 659 million reais ($330 million) of water and waste-
treatment projects with government financing, the southern
 Brazil  water utility’s biggest investment in 50 years.  Sanepar, as the utility is known, will build 25 projects
through 2016 including a 26-meter-high (85-foot) dam on the
Miringuava River and three water reservoirs in Londrina, a
spokeswoman said today in a telephone interview.  The Ministry of Cities is studying how much government
financing will be committed to each project under its PAC 2
economic program, she said. Lenders including state-controlled
Caixa Economica Federal and government-run Banco Nacional de
Desenvolvimento Economico e Social may provide as much as 95
percent of project costs.  “We are making our biggest investment in 50 years to keep
Parana in the forefront” of sanitation services in Brazil,
Sanepar President Fernando Ghignone said in an April 2
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
