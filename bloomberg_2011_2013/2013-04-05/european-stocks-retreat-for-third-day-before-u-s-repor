European stocks declined for a third
day, led by a selloff in airlines, before a report on American
payrolls. U.S. index futures also fell, while Asian shares
climbed.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA led airlines
lower, falling 5.1 percent, amid concern an outbreak of bird flu
in  China  will hurt travel demand.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.3 percent to 290.8 at
8:51 a.m. in  London , extending its retreat so far this week to 1
percent. Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures lost 0.2 percent
today while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
