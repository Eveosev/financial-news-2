Total SA (FP)  bought a cargo of Forties
crude in the North Sea market, bringing its total to seven since
March 27.  Daily shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk
crudes from the region, which make up the Dated Brent benchmark,
will increase by 1.5 percent in May from this month, loading
programs obtained by Bloomberg News show.  North Sea  Vitol sold the Forties shipment for loading April 22 to
April 24 at 25 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window. That’s unchanged from a trade yesterday.  BFOE crude loadings are scheduled to rise to 893,548
barrels a day in May versus 880,000 barrels in April, according
to a tally of the four loading plans. Ekofisk shipments will
decline while the other three blends all show an increase.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days narrowed by 4 cents to a discount of 25 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $104.73 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $105.84 in the previous session. The June
contract was at $104.66, a discount of 7 cents to May.  A threatened labor strike in Norway, western Europe’s
biggest oil and gas producer, risks disrupting a fifth of the
country’s petroleum output.  Norway’s LO and YS unions will order more than 17,000
private-sector workers off the job from 6 a.m. on April 8 should
state-backed mediation fail this weekend. Strikers would include
more than 300 workers at two coastline bases that supply 18 oil
platforms and rigs, possibly forcing them to close within days,
according to the LO-affiliated Industry Energy union.  Mediterranean/Urals  No bids or offers were declared for Russian Urals crude,
according to the survey of Platts. The grade was bid in the
Mediterranean yesterday at discounts of 70 cents to $1 a barrel
to Dated Brent and last traded at minus 90 cents on Feb. 22.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed 11 cents to 75 cents a barrel, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the least since Feb. 4. In northwest
Europe, the  discount  was at $2.15 a barrel, compared with minus
$2.20 in the previous session.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend was $3.60 a barrel more
than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s
unchanged from yesterday and is the most since Oct. 6, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
