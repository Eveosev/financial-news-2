Admiral Group Plc (ADM) , the U.K. motor
insurer that owns confused.com, started joint ventures with two
law firms after the government banned the practice of selling
details of customers who have been in an accident.  Admiral will form the partnerships with law firms Lyons
Davidson and Cordner Lewis Solicitors beginning May 1, the
Cardiff, Wales-based firm said today in a statement. The
government on April 1 banned so-called referral fees paid to
insurers.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  outlawed the fees as part of
an attempt to bring down the cost of motor insurance, which has
climbed by more than a third over the past four years as claims
soared due to the success of lawyers working on contingency fees
and spurious injuries. By bringing the legal services in-house,
Admiral gets to maintain revenue from successful legal claims
against other insurers.  “This is about protecting a revenue stream from law firms
that has just become outlawed,” said  Kevin Ryan , a London-based
analyst at  Investec Plc (INVP)  with a sell rating on the stock. “The
challenge will now be to charge the customer for using the
service.”  The ventures will not make a “material contribution” to
Admiral’s profit in the foreseeable future, the insurer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
