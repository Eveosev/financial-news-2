Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Following an increase the previous month, employment
declined by 55,000 in March, all in full time. The unemployment
rate rose 0.2 percentage points to 7.2%.  Despite the decline in March, employment was 1.2% or
203,000 above the level of 12 months earlier, with the increase
mainly in full-time work. Over the same period, the total number
of hours worked also rose by 1.2%.  Provincially, employment declined in Quebec, British
Columbia and  Alberta , and edged down in Ontario. The only
province with an increase was Nova Scotia.  In March, there were fewer people employed in three
industries: accommodation and food services, public
administration and manufacturing. At the same time, there was
little change in the other industries.  There were 85,000 fewer private-sector employees in March,
while the number of self-employed rose by 39,000 and the number
of public-sector employees was little changed. Compared with 12
months earlier, the number of private-sector employees increased
by 1.0% or 111,000, while the number of self-employed was up
2.1% or 55,000 as a result of the gains in March. Public-sector
employment was little changed over the 12-month period.  Employment in March decreased among people aged 25 to 54,
while there was little change among youths and people aged 55
and over.  Provincial summary  Employment in  Quebec  declined by 17,000 in March, and the
unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage points to 7.7%. Despite
this decrease, employment in the province was 1.6% above the
level of 12 months earlier, compared with a national growth rate
of 1.2%.  Employment in British Columbia was down 15,000, offsetting
most of the increase in February. This pushed the unemployment
rate up 0.7 percentage points to 7.0%. Compared with 12 months
earlier, employment in the province was little changed.  In Alberta, there were 11,000 fewer people employed in
March, the first notable decline in more than two years. The
unemployment rate in the province rose 0.3 percentage points to
4.8%, still one of the lowest in the country. While there were
fewer people working in March, Alberta experienced employment
growth of 1.7% on a year-over-year basis.  In Ontario, employment edged down by 17,000 in March,
following an increase of 35,000 the month before. The
unemployment rate held steady at 7.7%, a result of fewer people
participating in the labour force. Year-over-year employment
growth in the province was 0.8%.  Nova Scotia  was the only province with an employment
increase in March, up 2,900, following a similar increase the
month before. The unemployment rate in the province was 9.5%.
Despite the recent gains, employment was little changed compared
with 12 months earlier.  While employment in Saskatchewan was little changed in
March, the province experienced the strongest year-over-year
growth in the country, at 4.6%. The unemployment rate was 3.9%
in March, still the lowest among all provinces.  Industry employment  In March, there were notable employment declines in
accommodation and food services, public administration and
manufacturing.  Employment in accommodation and food services fell by
25,000, offsetting an increase the month before. This left
employment in the industry similar to the level of 12 months
earlier.  Public administration employment decreased by 24,000 in
March, leaving employment in this industry down slightly from 12
months earlier.  The number of workers in manufacturing declined by 24,000
in March, following a similar decrease the previous month.
Employment growth in the spring of 2012 was followed by losses
since the summer, leaving employment in this industry down 2.8%
from 12 months earlier.  Employment declines among people 25 to 54  Among people aged 25 to 54, employment declined by 47,000,
equally divided between men and women. Compared with 12 months
earlier, employment for this age group was up 0.6% or 68,000.  Employment among those aged 55 and over was little changed
in March. On a year-over-year basis, employment among people in
this age group rose by 4.2% or 135,000, partly a result of
population ageing.  Among youths aged 15 to 24, employment was also little
changed in March, while their unemployment rate increased 0.6
percentage points to 14.2%, as more youths searched for work.
Employment among youths has been on a slight upward trend since
August 2012.  Quarterly update for the territories  The Labour Force Survey also collects labour market
information about the territories. This information is produced
monthly in the form of three-month moving averages. The
following data are not seasonally adjusted; therefore,
comparisons should only be made on a year-over-year basis.  In the first quarter of 2013, employment and the
unemployment rates in Yukon and the  Northwest Territories  were
similar to those of the first quarter of 2012. The unemployment
rate was 7.6% in Yukon and 8.0% in the Northwest Territories in
the first quarter of 2013.  In Nunavut, employment increased by 700 in the first
quarter of 2013, compared with the same quarter in 2012, and the
unemployment rate fell from 15.3% to 11.4% over the same period.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a
result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends
observed over longer time periods. Estimates for smaller
geographic areas or industries also have more variability. For
an explanation of sampling variability of estimates and how to
use standard errors to assess this variability, consult the
‘Estimates quality’ section of the publication Labour Force
Information (71-001-X).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted estimates, which facilitates comparisons by removing
the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends ( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc -
cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=fra) .  Each year, the LFS revises its estimates for the previous
three years, using the latest seasonal factors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
