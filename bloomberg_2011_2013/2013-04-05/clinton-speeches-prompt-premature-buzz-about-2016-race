Hillary Clinton fans looking to the
stage of New York’s Lincoln Center today for signs of her 2016
presidential ambitions came away empty-handed.  The former secretary of state, addressing the  Women in the
World Summit  -- her second speaking appearance this week --
stuck strictly to the theme of the “unfinished business” of
advancing opportunities for women and girls in the U.S. and
around the world.  “Too many otherwise thoughtful people continue to see the
fortunes of women and girls as somehow separate from society at
large,” Clinton said. Peace and prosperity are advanced
globally when more doors are opened to women and everyone has a
stake in the cause, she said. “No country can achieve its full
economic potential when women are left out or left behind.”  Those close to Clinton say the more public presence doesn’t
mean she’s planning to run, even as that possibility casts a
shadow over other potential Democratic candidates seeking to lay
the foundation for their own campaigns.  “I get all the enthusiasm there is for her to run,” Mo Elleithee, a top spokesman for Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid,
said in an e-mail. “But my advice to everyone is to calm down.
If she decides to reconsider and look at the race, I think
she’ll do so at the appropriate time. There’s no rush.”  Clinton has said she has no plans for a second presidential
run. She also hasn’t ruled it out.  Her body language will be closely watched by the political
community in the months, and years, ahead for any signal that
she’s approaching a decision. Supporters have already formed a
super-political action committee to back a possible bid.  ‘Fastest Car’  James Carville, who managed the 1992 campaign of her
husband, President Bill Clinton, yesterday sent an e-mail appeal
for the group saying “it isn’t worth squat to have the fastest
car at the racetrack if there ain’t any gas in the tank -- and
that’s why the work that Ready for Hillary PAC is doing is
absolutely critical.”  Since it was created in January, the Ready for Hillary PAC
is seeing on average about 1,000 grassroots supporters a day
sign up to back the effort to get Clinton to run for president,
the group said in an April 1 statement. Ready for Hillary has
more than 54,000 followers on Twitter and more than 100,000 e-
mail addresses in its database.  ‘What’s Next’  About a dozen supporters with Ready for Hillary signs
gathered outside the Lincoln Center, where Clinton was
introduced by Tina Brown, editor in chief of Newsweek/Daily
Beast Co.  “The big question about Hillary is what’s next,” Brown
said.  A survey released last month of U.S. voters by Hamden,
Connecticut-based  Quinnipiac University , showed Clinton
dominating in match-ups against hypothetical Republican
presidential opponents.  The poll showed Clinton leading New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 45 percent to 37 percent; Republican Florida Senator
Marco Rubio, 50 percent to 34 percent; and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the party’s 2012 vice-presidential nominee,
50 percent to 38 percent. The survey of 1,944 registered voters
was conducted Feb. 27-March 4 and had a margin of error of plus
or minus 2.2 percentage points.  Obama Primary  Clinton also was viewed as the frontrunner years ahead of
the 2008 election, before she faced a relatively unknown U.S.
senator from Illinois named  Barack Obama . Then a U.S. senator
from New York, Clinton lost the Democratic nomination that year
to Obama, who picked her as his first secretary of state.  The potential of a Clinton candidacy in 2016 presents
unique challenges for other potential Democratic candidates such
as Vice President Joe Biden, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and
Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley, said Linda Fowler, a
government professor at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New
Hampshire.  “These guys can’t raise money right now, but they can
start showing up in early primary states and get known,” Fowler
said. “On the one hand she is in the way, and yet she provides
some cover for them to do some quiet spade work.”  Fowler said Clinton likely will need to make a decision
within the next year if she wants to have enough time to build a
top-notch campaign and grassroots fundraising operation.  “You can’t do it just with large donors, so you do need
more time to create the small-donor base,” she said.  Campaign Rigors  Clinton will have to decide whether she wants to go through
the rigors of another presidential campaign, Fowler said. She
will turn 69 about two weeks before the 2016 election, younger
than Republicans Ronald Reagan or John McCain during their
presidential primary bids.  The former first lady has done just enough in the political
arena to keep potential donors and supporters intrigued by the
historic potential of backing a candidate who could become the
first woman president.  Clinton has addressed the Women in the World Summit every
year since its inception in 2010.  While she focused much of her speech on the struggles of
women in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Africa and the Middle East and
issues of poverty, illiteracy and slavery, Clinton closed with
an emphasis on the work that needs to take place in the U.S.,
such as equal pay for equal work.  “For too many American women, opportunity, and the dream
of upward mobility, the American Dream, remains elusive,” she
said. “I look forward to being your partner in all the days and
years ahead.”  The two-day event brings together women from around the
globe, from business and world leaders to grassroots activists
and dissidents.  Hollywood Speakers  The event features a lineup of powerful women, including
Oprah Winfrey and U.S. United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice, as
well as actresses Meryl Streep and Eva Longoria.  Clinton’s speech earlier this week, her first since
finishing her service as secretary of state, focused on
advocating women’s rights globally and was delivered at the
Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards in Washington.  Besides her speeches, she also released a video last month
in which for the first time she announced support for same-sex
marriage. She’s also embarking on a lucrative public speaking
tour and working on her next book.  On the Republican side, potential 2016 candidates are
already scheduling trips to Iowa, the state that traditionally
hosts the first primary season voting. Senator Rand Paul of
Kentucky will headline a May 10 state party fundraising dinner,
and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is scheduled to deliver a
speech at another party function less than two weeks later.  Paul is also scheduled next month to address the Republican
party in New Hampshire, the state that historically has followed
the Iowa caucuses.  To contact the reporters on this story:
