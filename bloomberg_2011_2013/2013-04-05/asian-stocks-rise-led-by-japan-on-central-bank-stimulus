Asian  stocks  rose, with Japanese
shares surging to the highest closing level in 4 1/2 years,
after the Bank of  Japan ’s new governor announced unprecedented
monetary easing to end two decades of economic stagnation.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  surged 1.6 percent to
12,833.64, after earlier climbing above 13,000 for the first
time since August 2008, as the yen fell against all its major
peers. Exporters Toyota Motor Corp. jumped 3.4 percent and Canon
Inc. rose 1.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 2.6
percent amid concern an outbreak of bird flu that has killed six
people in  China  may cause an epidemic.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.4 percent to 134.11
as of 3:12 p.m. in  Tokyo , paring this week’s drop to 1.1
percent. Benchmark stock indexes fell  outside Japan . Hong Kong’s
market reopened today, while markets in China and  Taiwan  remain
closed for a holiday.  “It’s a typhoon of cash globally,” said Jason Brady, a
fund manager who helps oversee about $84 billion in assets at
Thornburg Investment Management Inc. in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
“Central banks everywhere are doing the exact same thing. You
have to believe that all of this printing or all of this
stimulus is actually going to lead to sustainable economic
growth.” He spoke in a Bloomberg TV interview with  Susan Li .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index fell 1.3
percent to 461.89, taking its loss this week to 2.3 percent.
 Australia ’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  declined 0.5 percent, Sinagpore’s
Straits Times Index retreated 0.3 percent and New Zealand NZX 50
Index advanced 0.1 percent.  South Korea’s  Kospi index  slid 1.6 percent, heading for the
largest weekly decline in 10 months, as the risk of conflict
with North Korea spurred capital outflows.  BOJ, ECB  The Bank of Japan yesterday boosted its stimulus program,
saying it will double the monetary base within two years.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi yesterday signaled
the ECB will keep monetary policy loose for an extended period
and that further easing is possible if economic conditions
deteriorate. The Federal Reserve last month said it will
continue buying U.S. securities at a rate of $85 billion per
month, and will keep buying until the labor market improves
“substantially.”  An expansion of monetary easing at the Bank of Japan may
trigger “an avalanche” in the yen as Japanese put money
elsewhere in anticipation of sustained currency depreciation,
billionaire investor  George Soros  said.  Toyota Motor, the world’s largest carmaker, advanced 3.4
percent to 5,090 yen and Canon gained 1.5 percent to 3,290 yen.
The yen earlier weakened to 97 per dollar for the first time
since August 2009. A decline in the currency boosts the value of
Japanese export earnings when repatriated from abroad.  Japanese Banks  Japanese  banks  and property companies rose as optimism grew
that action by the country’s central bank and government will
increase asset prices. Mizuho Financial Group Inc. jumped 1.5
percent to 209 yen and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.
surged 4.8 percent to 4,150 yen.  Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801)  climbed 13
percent to 3,310 yen.  Trading volume on the Nikkei 225 was more than double the
30-day average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) , the regional benchmark gauge,
climbed the past five months as Japanese shares increased on
speculation the nation will deploy more stimulus and amid signs
the U.S. economy is recovering.  That left the gauge yesterday trading at 13.3 times average
estimated earnings compared with 14.1 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.5 times for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  slid 0.2 percent. The gauge
added 0.4 percent yesterday as central banks in Japan and Europe
reassured investors that they will keep economies awash in cash
to bolster growth.  U.S. Jobs  A U.S. government report today is forecast to show a gain
of 190,000 in U.S. payrolls last month, following a 236,000
advance in February, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The jobless rate probably probably remained at 7.7
percent.  Seven & I Holdings Co. (3382)  surged 10 percent to 3,400 yen, the
highest since 2008, after the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience-
store brand said a weaker yen and adding stores in Japan and
overseas will help boost profit to a record this year.  China Southern Airlines Co., the country’s biggest domestic
carrier, lost 7.6 percent to HK$3.91 in Hong Kong and  Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  slid 4.1 percent to HK$12.28. Six people
have died from a new strain of bird flu that emerged in eastern
China as authorities detected the virus in pigeon samples
collected at a marketplace.  ‘Panic Mode’  “We are pretty much in a panic mode from a possible
epidemic from the new bird flu in China.” said Jackson Wong,
vice president at Hong Kong-based brokerage Tanrich Securities
Co., noting the sell-off in Hong Kong was probably worsened
because Chinese markets are closed for a holiday. “Investors
cannot sell A-shares today so the only thing they can do is sell
their H-share counterparts.”  PetroChina Co. (857) , Asia’s biggest company by market value,
sank 3.9 percent to HK$9.88 in Hong Kong and Cnooc Ltd., China’s
No.1 offshore producer of oil, lost 4.4 percent to HK$14.28.
Crude oil traded near a two-week low and is headed for its
biggest weekly drop since October after U.S. inventories climbed
to a 22-year high, raising concerns that slower economic growth
may weaken fuel demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
