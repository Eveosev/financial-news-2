Treasuries gained, pushing 10-year
note yields to the lowest level in almost four months, as a
weaker-than-expected jobs report added to speculation that
growth in the world’s biggest economy is slowing.  Yields on the benchmark note dropped the most in a week
since August after payrolls grew by 88,000 workers last month,
the least in nine months, even as the unemployment rate
declined, the Labor Department said. Yields have fallen as
gauges of company hiring and U.S. services industries trailed
estimates. Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators
increased their net-long position in five-year note futures to a
more than six-month high.  “It really puts the trajectory of the economy in
question,” said William Larkin, a fixed-income money manager
who helps oversee $500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc.
“It makes Treasuries very attractive. It puts the Fed’s
statements at an elevated level -- the next employment report is
going to be highly sensitive.”  Ten-year note  yields  fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.71 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They touched 1.68
percent, the lowest level since Dec. 12. The price of the 2
percent note maturing in February 2023 rose 14/32, or $4.38 per
$1,000 face value, to 102 1/2.  Futures Trading  Speculative long positions in the  five-year note , or bets
prices will rise, outnumbered short positions by 157,564
contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade in the week ending April
2, rising 24 percent from a week earlier, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. That’s the highest
since Sept. 21.  Yields on five-year debt fell one basis point to 0.7
percent.  Net-long positions in  10-year note futures  also rose,
outnumbering short positions by 110,692  contracts , the most
since the week ending March 1.  The 10-year yield traded below its  200-day moving average 
of 1.74 percent for the first time since Jan. 2 after closing
below its 100-day moving average of 1.83 percent on April 3 for
the first time since Dec. 11. Moving averages are indicators of
momentum.  The  yield  on the 30-year bond touched 2.84 percent, the
lowest level since Dec. 12. It traded below its 200-day moving
average of 2.9 percent for the first time this year.  Yield Curve  The difference between the yields on two-year and 10-year
notes, called the yield curve, narrowed to 1.48 percentage
points, the lowest level since Dec. 31. It dropped from a 2013
high of 1.82 percentage points reached on March 8, the date of
the last payrolls report.  The 14-day  relative strength  index for 10-year note yields
indicated rates may not fall much further. The index touched
27.8, below the level of 30 indicating a reversal of direction
may be imminent.  “It’s not going to alter the Fed’s approach,” Richard Schlanger, a vice president at Pioneer Investments in  Boston  and
a member of a group managing $20 billion in fixed-income
securities, said of the jobs report. “I think they’re very
concerned, obviously, with the decline in the participation
rate.”  The  unemployment rate , derived from a separate survey of
households, dropped to 7.6 percent versus a forecast to hold at
7.7 percent, according to the Bloomberg survey median. The
figure, the lowest since December 2008, reflected a 496,000
decline in the size of the labor force.  February Revision  The growth in payrolls followed a revised 268,000 gain in
February that was higher than first estimated, Labor Department
figures showed. The median forecast of 87 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg projected an advance of 190,000.  The economy added an average of 179,000 people a month to
nonfarm payrolls in 2011 and 2012, Labor Department data show.
The  jobless rate  had stayed above 8 percent since February 2009
until it broke the trend in September.  The U.S. central bank has been buying $85 billion of bonds
each month since the start of the year, $45 billion in
Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage debt, in an effort to
hold down borrowing costs and encourage economic growth. It has
kept its benchmark  interest-rate  target for overnight lending
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to
support the economy.  Rate Increase  Policy makers reiterated March 20 the rate will stay  near
zero  as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and
inflation is projected to be no more than 2.5 percent. They said
the purchases will continue until employment improves.  Swaps traders have pushed back expectations for the Fed
first interest-rate increase since adopting extraordinary
monetary stimulus to about November 2015 after slower jobs
growth in March. Yesterday, OIS showed July 2015 as the likely
date for a rate increase.  The central bank’s next policy meeting is scheduled for
April 30-May 1.  The yield on Treasury 10-year notes fell earlier this week
as investors sought U.S. debt as policy makers in  Japan  and the
euro zone promised more easing.  New  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said yesterday
the central bank would double its monthly asset purchases in a
bid to encourage inflation, while European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi said the ECB stands ready to cut interest
rates and consider additional measures to boost growth as the
region’s sovereign-debt crisis enters its fourth year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
