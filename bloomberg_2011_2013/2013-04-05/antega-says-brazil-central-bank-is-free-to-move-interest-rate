Brazil’s interest rate is not frozen
and the central bank has freedom to raise or cut it as judged
necessary, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said yesterday.  Analysts covering Brazil expect policy makers to raise
 interest rates  by 1.25 percentage points to 8.50 percent by
year-end, according to the latest central bank survey of about
100 economists, published April 1.  “The central bank can raise the rate and cut the rate when
it thinks it’s necessary,” Mantega said during an interview
with  Miriam Leitao  broadcast by Globonews. “It can be done at
any time,” he said.  According to Mantega, the Selic can vary less than it has
in the past as Brazil has a “more efficient” monetary policy
today, with “more civilized” interest rates.  “It doesn’t need to go as high as it did in the past, if
it needs to go up,” Mantega said. “I’m not saying rates should
go up”  Brazil ’s consumer prices rose 6.43 percent in the 12 months
through mid-March. Monetary policy makers have kept borrowing
costs at a record-low 7.25 percent since October to revive an
economy growing at the slowest two-year pace in more than a
decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
