The  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s move to expand
monetary easing may trigger “an avalanche” in the yen as
Japanese put money elsewhere in anticipation of sustained
 currency depreciation , billionaire investor  George Soros  said.  Calling the expanded stimulus “a sensation” and “a very
daring undertaking,” Soros said policy makers may not be able
to arrest the fall in the yen and capital flight as the new
policy was adopted after 25 years of mounting government
deficits and failure to rejuvenate the economy.  “What  Japan  is doing is actually quite dangerous because
they’re doing it after 25 years of just simply accumulating
deficits and not getting the economy going,” Soros said in an
interview with CNBC in Hong Kong today. “If the yen starts to
fall, which it has done, and people in Japan realize that it’s
liable to continue and want to put their money abroad, then the
fall may become like an avalanche.”  The BOJ’s new Governor Haruhiko Kuroda laid out plans for
Japan’s biggest round of quantitative easing, expanding the
central bank’s balance sheet by 30 percent of gross domestic
product between now and the end of 2014.  “If what they’re doing gets something started, they may
not be able to stop it,” Soros said.  The yen touched the weakest since August 2009 against the
dollar and fell as much as 0.8 percent lower to 97.06 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
