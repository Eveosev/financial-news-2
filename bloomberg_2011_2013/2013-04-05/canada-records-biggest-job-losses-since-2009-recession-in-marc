Canada ’s biggest  employment  loss
since the recession four years ago and an unexpected trade
deficit underscore how the world’s 11th largest economy is being
hobbled by weak global demand.  The drop of 54,500 positions reported today by  Statistics
Canada  offset a 50,700 gain in February, and lifted the
 unemployment rate  to 7.2 percent from 7 percent. The merchandise
trade deficit for February was the 11th in a row, marking the
longest streak in records dating to 1988.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  has said a rebound in
exports and business investment will lead growth through next
year as consumers struggle with record debt loads. The country’s
currency fell the most on an intraday basis in nine months on
today’s figures, coupled with a weaker-than-expected U.S. job
report that suggested continued weakness in the country that
buys three-quarters of Canada’s exports.  “In the Canadian numbers there was no silver lining
whatsoever,” said  Avery Shenfeld , chief economist at  CIBC World
Markets  in Toronto. “We aren’t yet getting enough lift to
exports, as today’s data shows, to compensate for a much less
exciting domestic housing market.”  The Canadian dollar fell after the employment and trade
reports, dropping as much as 1.1 percent, the most since June.
It traded down 0.4 percent to C$1.0163 at 4:38 p.m. in Toronto.
One dollar buys 98.39 U.S. cents. Bonds rose, with the yield on
the 10-year government benchmark falling 5 basis points to 1.74
percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite   Index (SPTSX)  fell 31.20
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,331.85 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark gauge lost 3.3 percent this week, erasing its gain for
the year amid concern over global economic growth that has
pressured oil and metal prices.  Slowing Output  The report brings the labor market more in line with other
parts of the economy, where  output growth  slowed to a 0.6
percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter and inflation has
lagged the central bank’s 2 percent target since May.  “As bad as the headline was, there wasn’t much below the
surface to make it better,”  Robert Kavcic , senior economist at
Bank of Montreal, said by telephone from Toronto. “We were
pretty suspicious with what we had seen in the last four
months,” he said, referring to improvements in the job market.  Full-time employment fell by 54,000 in March while part-
time work declined by 400 positions, according to the report
from Ottawa-based Statistics Canada.  Private companies cut 85,400 workers and public-sector
employment fell by 7,700. Workers designated as employees by
Statistics Canada fell by 93,100 while self-employment increased
by 38,700.  Accommodation and food service fell by 24,900 jobs in
March, followed by cuts of 24,300 in public administration and
24,200 in manufacturing.  Plant Closing  A.O. Smith Corp. said April 3 it will close a residential
water heater plant in Fergus, Ontario, with 350 workers. The
Milwaukee-based company said in a statement the industry was
“burdened with overcapacity for a number of years,” adding
“we have been facing a challenging economic environment as a
Canadian manufacturer.”  The U.S. employment report for March was also weaker than
forecast, with Labor Department figures showing payrolls rose by
88,000, less than half the amount forecast by economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  Canada’s February trade deficit of C$1.02 billion ($1.00
billion) followed a January figure that was revised to C$746
million from C$237 million, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a C$100
million surplus, as well as an employment gain.  Exports fell 0.6 percent to C$38.5 billion in February, as
shipments of metal and non-metallic minerals dropped 7 percent
to C$4.69 billion. The surplus with the U.S. narrowed to C$3.40
billion from C$3.90 billion a month earlier.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he is “disappointed”
with the job loss, calling it “a snapshot in time” in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
