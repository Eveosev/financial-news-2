U.S. stock futures extended losses
after government data showed the nation added less than half the
number of jobs that economists forecast last month, spurring
concern about the strength of the labor market.  Payrolls grew by 88,000 workers last month, the smallest in
nine months, after a revised 268,000 gain in February that was
higher than first estimated, Labor Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast of 87 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg projected an advance of 190,000. The
jobless rate fell to 7.6 percent from 7.7 percent.   Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in June
retreated 1 percent to 1,538 at 8:31 a.m. in  New York . The
equity benchmark gained 0.4 percent yesterday, trimming its
weekly decline to 0.6 percent, as Japan’s central bank increased
its stimulus program. Contracts on the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  fell 134 points, or 0.9 percent, to 14,397 today.  The  bull market  in U.S. equities entered its fifth year
last month. The S&P 500 has surged 131 percent from a 12-year
low in 2009 as companies reported better-than-estimated  earnings 
and the  Federal Reserve  embarked on three rounds of bond
purchases to stimulate the economy. The  S&P 500  and the Dow
closed at record highs on April 2.  Alcoa Inc. unofficially kicks off the first-quarter
earnings season on April 8 when it reports its financial results
after equity markets close, the first Dow average company to
report.  Earnings at S&P 500 companies decreased 1.9 percent in the
first three months of the year, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. That would mark the first year-over-year
decrease in profit since 2009. Energy company earnings fell the
most with a drop of 6.6 percent, the estimates show, as oil
traded at at an average of $94.36 a barrel during the period
compared with $103.03 in the first quarter of 2012. Profit at
technology companies declined 4.1 percent for the second-biggest
drop, the data show.        To contact the editor responsible for this story:
