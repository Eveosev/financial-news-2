Sundance Resources Ltd. (SDL) , which said
last month a A$1.14 billion ($1.2 billion) takeover bid by
Sichuan Hanlong Group may be scrapped, concluded a period of
discussions with its suitor.  The outcome of the good faith consultation with the Chinese
company is being documented and an announcement is expected on
April 9, Perth-based Sundance said today in a statement. The
companies entered a five-day consultation period under the terms
agreement after Hanlong missed a March 26 funding deadline.  Closely-held Hanlong’s billionaire Chairman Liu Han
reportedly is in police custody after going missing last month.
Sundance needs an investment of $4.7 billion for its Mbalam
project located on the Cameroon and Republic of Congo border.  “Sundance has concluded in principle the outcomes of the
matters discussed with Hanlong in the good faith consultation
period,” according to the statement. “This requires
ratification and signature by the parties and includes a
requirement for translation into Chinese and execution in
 China .”  Sundance asked for a share trading halt to be extended to
April 9. The shares were suspended on March 19 after trading at
21 cents in Sydney, below Hanlong’s offer of 45 cents a share.
That signaled investors don’t expect the deal to succeed.  Hanlong, which holds about  14 percent  of Sundance,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, in August cut its bid
for Sundance by 21 percent to 45 cents. Sundance shares have
fallen more than 46 percent since Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
