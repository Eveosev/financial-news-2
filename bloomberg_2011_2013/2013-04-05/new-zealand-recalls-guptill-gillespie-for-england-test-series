New Zealand recalled Martin Guptill
and Mark Gillespie for next month’s Test cricket series in
 England , adding them to the squad that secured a 0-0 home draw
when the teams met in March.  Top-order batsman Guptill returns after recovering from
thumb surgery, while fast bowler Gillespie’s form in domestic
competitions warranted his reselection, New Zealand Cricket said
in an e-mailed statement. Paceman Ian Butler was omitted after
being on standby against England last month.  New Zealand is scheduled to play two Tests in England
starting May 16 and May 24. The teams will then meet in three
one-day matches before competing in June’s eight-nation
Champions Trophy, where they are drawn in the same group.  Black Caps selectors also named a 15-man one-day squad
today featuring the callup of former Australia wicketkeeper-
batsman Luke Ronchi and the returns of injured bowlers Daniel Vettori and Mitchell McClenaghan.  TEST SQUAD: Brendon McCullum (captain), Trent Boult, Doug
Bracewell, Dean Brownlie, Peter Fulton, Martin Guptill, Mark
Gillespie, Tom Latham, Bruce Martin, Hamish Rutherford, Tim
Southee, Ross Taylor, Neil Wagner, BJ Watling, Kane Williamson.  ONE-DAY/CHAMPIONS TROPHY SQUAD: Brendon McCullum (captain),
Trent Boult, Grant Elliott, Andrew Ellis, James Franklin, Martin
Guptill, Mitchell McClenaghan, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills,
Colin Munro, Luke Ronchi, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, Daniel
Vettori, Kane Williamson.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
