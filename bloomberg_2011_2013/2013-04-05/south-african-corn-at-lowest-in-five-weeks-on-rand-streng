South African corn prices dropped to
the lowest in more than five weeks as the rand gained against
the dollar, making locally produced grain cheaper.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
closed 2.9 percent lower at 2,075.80 rand ($227) a metric ton in
Johannesburg, the lowest since Feb. 26. The yellow variety for
delivery in the same month decreased 2.1 percent to 2,058 rand a
ton.  The rand strengthened against the dollar yesterday after
central banks in  Japan  and  Europe  reassured investors they will
keep economies awash in cash to bolster growth. It gained a
further 0.2 percent to 9.1452 per dollar by 2:21 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  “The rand strengthened since yesterday and it influenced
the prices,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South
Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as  animal feed .  Wheat for May delivery decreased 0.7 percent to 3,379 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
