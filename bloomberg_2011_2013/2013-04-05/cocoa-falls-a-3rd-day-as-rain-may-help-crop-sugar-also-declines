Cocoa fell for a third day in London
on speculation rain is helping boost crop prospects in  Ivory
Coast , the world’s largest grower. Sugar also declined.  The Daloa region, which accounts for about a third of Ivory
Coast production, had three times more rain from March 21-31
than a year earlier, according to the National Meteorological
Service. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities is
down 3.3 percent this week, heading for the biggest weekly
decline since October.  “There was some concern dry weather would have a negative
effect in Ivory Coast so the rain may be easing those
concerns,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG
in  Frankfurt , by phone today. “Cocoa is getting caught up with
selling of many commodities.”  Cocoa for July delivery dropped 0.9 percent to 1,439 pounds
($2,191) a metric ton by 10:25 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
Prices in  New York  fell 0.8 percent to $2,125 a ton, the fourth
consecutive decline.  European cocoa usage in the first quarter probably fell 2
percent to 7 percent from a year earlier, Marex Spectron Group
Ltd. said in a report today, citing “estimates.” The European
Cocoa Association reports April 17 on the cocoa grindings. The
U.S. report due April 18 may show anywhere from a 5 percent drop
to 5 percent gain year-over-year, Marex said.  White, or refined, sugar retreated 0.2 percent to $489 a
ton and raw sugar fell 0.3 percent to 17.62 cents a pound.  Robusta coffee slipped 0.5 percent to $2,046 a ton and
arabica beans were down 0.5 percent to $1.3885 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
