Canadian stocks  declined, sending
the benchmark index toward its biggest weekly drop since May,
after the country’s employment fell the most in four years and
U.S. jobs data missed economists’ forecasts.  Enbridge Inc. and Niko Resources Ltd. declined more than
1.7 percent as oil sank. Toronto-Dominion Bank slipped 1.4
percent. Manulife Financial Corp. dropped 2.2 percent, extending
its losing streak to three days. Centerra Gold Inc. jumped 4
percent after the metal rebounded from a 10-month low.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 76.86
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,286.19 at 11:40 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark gauge has lost 3.6 percent this week, erasing its
gain for the year amid concern over global economic growth that
has pressured oil and metal prices.  “It’s the job number and the fact that the Canadian market
has been so beaten up and battered and bruised, it’s tapping out
here,”  Barry Schwartz ,  fund manager  with Baskin Financial
Services who helps manage about C$500 million ($490 million),
said in a phone interview from Toronto.“We cannot seem to get
any traction in terms of commodities, and all of a sudden the
banks have given up their gains.”  Canada ’s unemployment rate rose for the first time in five
months, to 7.2 percent from 7 percent, and the surprise decline
of 54,500 jobs in March offset a 50,700 gain in February,
government data showed today. Economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News  projected a 6,500 job gain and 7 percent unemployment,
according to median forecasts.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. jobs data showed payrolls grew by 88,000 workers in
March, the smallest in nine months and less than half the total
expected by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Crude fell for a third day on concern the disappointing
U.S. jobs data signal weaker economic growth for the world’s
largest consumer of oil. Gold futures jumped in  New York  as
investors sought safety after the hiring slowdown.  Bank stocks contributed most to the benchmark Canadian
index’s decline. The S&P/TSX Financials Index fell 1 percent,
its third day of losses that have erased most of the gauge’s
gain for the year.  Toronto-Dominion Bank, the nation’s second-largest lender,
slipped 1.4 percent to C$80.89. Manulife Financial dropped 2.2
percent to C$14. Bank of  Nova Scotia  retreated 1.2 percent to
C$57.05.  Energy stocks declined 0.2 percent as  oil prices  headed for
the biggest weekly drop in six months. Crude lost 0.9 percent to
$92.38 a barrel. Enbridge sank 2.4 percent to C$45.30 and Niko
Resources declined 1.7 percent to C$6.21.  Raw-materials producers had the best performance among 10
groups in the S&P/TSX after gold headed for the biggest advance
in three weeks. The metal rose 0.9 percent to $1,565.80.
Centerra jumped 4 percent to C$5.96 and Torex Gold Resources
Inc. climbed 2.7 percent to C$1.70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
