Brazil ’s swap rates fell the most in
three weeks on speculation a struggling global economy will help
curb inflation and allow the central bank to refrain from
raising borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 declined
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 8.45 percent at
10:23 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the biggest drop since March 14. They
are down five basis points this week. The currency appreciated
0.2 percent to 2.0107 per  U.S. dollar , extending its advance
since March 29 to 0.6 percent.  Commodities fell today as the U.S. payrolls report showed
employers hired fewer workers than forecast, fueling speculation
that slowing growth in the world’s largest economy will dim
prospects for Brazil. Central bank President Alexandre Tombini
said in Senate testimony this week that board members will wait
for March inflation figures and other data before deciding on
the next policy steps.  “The drop in commodities may help reduce inflation,”
Paulo Gala, a strategist at Fator Corretora in Sao Paulo, said
in a telephone interview. “Tombini himself said in the Senate
that the drop in wholesale prices should be passed on to
consumer prices.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
