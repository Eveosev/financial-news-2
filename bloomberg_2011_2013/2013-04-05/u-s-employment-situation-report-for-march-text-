Following is the text of the March
employment report from the Labor Department.  Nonfarm payroll employment edged up in March (+88,000), and
the  unemployment rate  was little changed at 7.6 percent, the  U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Employment grew in
professional and business services and in health care but
declined in retail trade.  Household Survey Data  Both the number of unemployed persons, at 11.7 million, and
the unemployment rate, at 7.6 percent, were little changed in
March.  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for
adult men (6.9 percent), adult women (7.0 percent), teenagers
(24.2 percent), whites (6.7 percent), blacks (13.3 percent), and
Hispanics (9.2 percent) showed little or no change in March. The
jobless rate for Asians was 5.0 percent (not seasonally
adjusted), little changed from a year earlier.  In March, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless
for 27 weeks or more) was little changed at 4.6 million. These
individuals accounted for 39.6 percent of the unemployed.  The civilian  labor force  declined by 496,000 over the month,
and the labor force participation rate decreased by 0.2
percentage point to 63.3 percent. The employment-population
ratio, at 58.5 percent, changed little.  The number of persons employed part time for economic
reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers)
fell by 350,000 over the month to 7.6 million. These individuals
were working part time because their hours had been cut back or
because they were unable to find a full-time job.  In March, 2.3 million persons were marginally attached to
the labor force, essentially unchanged from a year earlier. (The
data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were not in
the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and had
looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not
counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in
the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 803,000
discouraged workers in March, little changed from a year earlier.
(These data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged workers
are persons not currently looking for work because they believe
no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.5 million
persons marginally attached to the labor force in March had not
searched for work for reasons such as school attendance or
family responsibilities.  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment edged up in March
(+88,000). Over the prior 12 months, employment growth had
averaged 169,000 per month. In March, employment increased in
professional and business services and in health care, while
retail trade employment declined.  Professional and business services added 51,000 jobs in
March. Over the past 12 months, employment in this industry has
grown by 533,000. Within professional and business services,
accounting and bookkeeping services added 11,000 jobs over the
month, and employment continued to trend up in temporary help
services and in several other component industries.  Job growth in health care continued in March, with a gain
of 23,000, similar to the prior 12-month average. Within health
care, employment increased by 15,000 in ambulatory health care
services, such as home health care, and by 8,000 in hospitals.  Construction employment continued to trend up in March
(+18,000). Job growth in this industry picked up this past fall;
since September, the industry has added 169,000 jobs. In March,
employment continued to expand among specialty trade contractors
(+23,000). Employment in specialty trade contractors has
increased by 128,000 since September, with the gain about
equally split between the residential and nonresidential
components.  Within leisure and hospitality, employment in food services
and drinking places continued to trend up in March (+13,000).
