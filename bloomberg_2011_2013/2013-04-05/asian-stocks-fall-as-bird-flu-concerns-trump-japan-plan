Asian stocks fell this week as a
fatal bird flu outbreak in China outweighed a surge in  Japanese
shares (TPX)  sparked by unprecedented stimulus from the  Bank of
Japan ’s new leadership.  Air China Ltd., Asia’s biggest carrier by market value,
plunged 12 percent, amid concern a strain of bird flu that has
killed six people in China may become an epidemic. Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, jumped 4.7 percent as the
yen fell against all its major peers.  Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303)  surged
19 percent as investors bet that more monetary easing from the
BOJ will boost loan demand and asset prices.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.5 percent to 133.49 this
week, erasing last week’s gain. Shares jumped in Japan after the
BOJ said it will double the monetary base by the end of 2014 in
its biggest round of quantitative easing.  “We are pretty much in a panic mode from a possible
epidemic from the new bird flu in China.” said Jackson Wong,
vice president at Hong Kong-based brokerage Tanrich Securities
Co. “When you look at the Japanese stimulus program it will
only help Japan for the time being, especially short term.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  has added about 3.6 percent
this year, less than half the gains on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, amid concern China will move to cool its property market.
Asia’s benchmark trades at 13.4 times average estimated earnings,
compared with multiples of 14 for the S&P 500 and 12.3 for the
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Whatever It Takes’  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) , the best performing major
equity gauge this year, finished the week at highest level since
Sept. 1, 2008, adding 3.5 percent. The measure has rallied 48
percent since mid-November amid bets policy makers would make
good on new BOJ Governor  Haruhiko Kuroda ’s pledge to do
“whatever it takes” to beat deflation.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index rose 0.3 percent, its second
consecutive weekly advance.  Every other major market in Asia fell.  Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index (AS51)  dropped 1.5 percent this week, its fourth straight
weekly decline. Singapore’s Straits Times Index slid 0.3 percent.  South Korea’s Kospi Index declined 3.9 percent as North
Korea moved a missile to its eastern coast, possibly for
training and test-firing, and warned it’s poised to conduct a
“smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear strike.”  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 2.6 percent to its
lowest level since November as China yesterday reported six
deaths from a new strain of bird flu. The  Shanghai  Composite
Index, which was closed the last two days, fell 0.5 percent on
the week.  Shanghai closed several live poultry trading markets and
began culling all birds in a market where a pigeon sample was
found contaminated with the H7N9 bird influenza virus, according
to the local government’s website. The city, China’s financial
hub, has reported four of the six H7N9 deaths.  Air China  Air China fell 12 percent to HK$6.05.  China Southern
Airlines Co. (1055) , Asia’s biggest carrier by passenger numbers,
retreated 13 percent to HK$3.87. Chinese and Hong Kong
developers also fell on the news with China Resources Land Ltd.,
sliding 3.2 percent to HK$21.00.  An expansion of monetary easing at the Bank of Japan may
trigger “an avalanche” in the yen as Japanese put money
elsewhere in anticipation of sustained currency depreciation,
billionaire investor  George Soros  said in an interview with CNBC
on April 5.  Toyota jumped 4.7 percent to 5,090 yen this week in Tokyo.
Mazda Motor Corp. rose 6.1 percent to 298 yen. Nissan Motor Co.
added 7 percent to 968 yen.  Shinsei Bank surged 19 percent to 253 yen. Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest lender, advanced 8.8
percent to 607 yen. Mitsui Fudosan Co., Japan’s largest property
company by revenue, surged 25 percent to 3,310 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
