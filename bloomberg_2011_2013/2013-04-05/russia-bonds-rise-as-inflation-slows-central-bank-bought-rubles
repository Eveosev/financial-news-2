Russia ’s ruble-denominated debt rose
as inflation slowed, increasing the chance of rate cuts. The
ruble snapped four days of declines after the central bank
reported the first foreign currency sales since November.  Benchmark bonds due February 2027 rallied, reducing the
yield eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.20
percent, the lowest level since Feb. 28. The notes are poised
for their best week since Jan. 11 with the yield down 15 basis
points. The ruble gained 0.1 percent against Bank Rossii’s
dollar-euro basket to 35.7115. The central bank said it bought
30 million rubles ($950,531) on the open market on April 3,
confirming that it is intervening after the ruble slid beyond
35.65 to the basket.  Inflation in Russia slowed to 7 percent in March from 7.3
percent in February, the Federal Statistics Service said
yesterday. Policy makers on April 2 left the benchmark
refinancing rate at 8.25 percent for a seventh month, while
cutting some borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
