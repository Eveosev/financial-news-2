Turkish  bond yields  dropped for a
third day as Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said  interest
rates  of about 6 percent are too high.  “We’ve pulled down interest rates from as high as 63
percent to about 6 percent since 2002,” Erdogan said in a
speech at the stock exchange in Istanbul. “This is still high.
I hope we will be lifting the pressure of interest on consumers
by decreasing it further.”  The comments, which came two days after central bank
Governor Erdem Basci said a “measured rate cut” may be in
store, sent yields on two-year lira bonds tumbling as much as 12
basis points to 6.04 percent. They were down seven basis points
at 6.09 percent at 2:40 p.m. in Istanbul today, set for the
lowest close since March 18. The weekly decline at 26 basis
points is the steepest since Jan. 11.  “Yields were already on the decline, and the statement
seems to have strengthened the trend,”  Haluk Burumcekci , chief
economist at Burgan Securities in Istanbul, said in a phone
interview. “But the real catalyst is the signal given by the
central bank on short-term interest rates.”  The central bank’s benchmark  repo rate  is 5.5 percent,
while the overnight lending rate and the overnight borrowing
rate, which comprise Basci’s interest rate corridor, are 7.5
percent and 4.5 percent, respectively.  Moderate Response  The central bank’s real effective exchange rate, which
measures the lira against an inflation-weighted basket of
currencies used by  Turkey ’s trading partners, rose to 119.95 in
March from 119.75 the previous month, the central bank said
yesterday. A reading between 120 and 130 could prompt a
“moderate” response, Basci said April 3. The lira appreciated
0.1 percent to 1.8005 per dollar today.  The rate cut outlook is despite  inflation  accelerating to
an annual 7.29 percent in March, exceeding the median forecast
for 7.03 percent in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
