Hedge funds’ combined holdings in
gold futures rose the most this month as continued U.S. monetary
stimulus spurred investors to sell short contracts and sent
prices toward the first quarterly advance in a year.  The net-long position in bullion jumped 12 percent to
78,654  futures and options  in the week ended Sept. 24, the most
since Aug. 27, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show. Long wagers gained 1.8 percent and short bets fell 17
percent, the biggest drop in four weeks. Combined net-long
 holdings  across 18 U.S.-traded commodities climbed 1.7 percent,
the first gain in September.  Gold rose 8.4 percent this quarter after a slump into a
 bear market  in April spurred sales of coins, jewelry and bars.
The  Federal Reserve  refrained from trimming bond buying this
month, surprising investors. The pace of purchases could remain
steady at $85 billion a month into January as policy makers wait
for more signs of economic recovery, Fed Bank of Chicago
President  Charles Evans  said Sept. 27. Bullion rose 70 percent
from December 2008 to June 2011 as the central bank bought debt.  “The Fed has made it clear that the economy is weak, and
the stimulus spigot will be open full-bore,” said  John Stephenson , who helps oversee about C$2.7 billion ($2.6 billion)
at First Asset Investment Management Inc. in Toronto. “That
means they’re continuing to inject more into the  money supply ,
and that is a bullish argument for gold.”  More Gains  Futures rose 0.5 percent to $1,339.20 an ounce on the Comex
in  New York  last week. Gold rebounded 13 percent since reaching
a 34-month low on June 28. It is still down 21 percent for the
year, poised for its first annual retreat since 2000, as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value. The
contract for delivery in December slid 0.9 percent to $1,327 at
1:30 p.m. in New York.  Seventeen traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect
prices to rise this week, with seven bearish and three neutral.
That’s the second consecutive bullish weekly survey, the first
back-to-back positive outlook since July.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
fell 0.4 percent last week and the MSCI All-Country World Index
of equities slid 0.6 percent. The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , a
gauge against 10 major trading partners, slipped 0.1 percent,
and the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index gained 0.5 percent.  Government Shutdown  Most analysts surveyed by Bloomberg Sept. 18-19 said they
now expect the Fed to wait until a December meeting to reduce
monthly bond buying. An August survey showed analysts forecast a
cut in September. Future purchases will depend on changes in
economic data, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Sept 18. U.S.
monetary stimulus and a budget debate among lawmakers that may
lead to a government shutdown means gold prices may rise in the
near term, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the same day.  The U.S. faced an impasse over raising the debt ceiling in
2011 before Congress approved a plan to head off a default. Gold
reached a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6, 2011. The Fed’s  balance
sheet  swelled to a record $3.73 trillion after three rounds of
so-called quantitative easing. Bullish gold bets more than
doubled since reaching a six-year low in June, CFTC data show.  Gold will probably resume declines into next year as the
 U.S. economy  improves, banks including Goldman, Citigroup Inc.
and Morgan Stanley say. The Fed’s decision on tapering was only
“deferred,” and bullion may average $1,270 in the last quarter
of 2014, Barclays Plc said Sept. 27.  Consumer Spending  The U.S. economy grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in
the second quarter after expanding 1.1 percent in the first
three months of the year, and  consumer spending  rose in August
for the fourth straight month, Commerce Department reports
showed last week.  Bullion  holdings  in exchange-traded products fell 27
percent this year, erasing $58.9 billion from the value of the
assets. Investors amassed a record 2,632.5 metric tons in
December. The ETP hoard climbed amid concern that stimulus would
spur inflation. U.S. consumer prices grew at a 1.5 percent
annual rate in August, compared with a 10-year average of 2.4
percent, Labor Department data showed Sept. 17.  “Evidence of an improvement within the global economy as
well as financial stability within the credit markets is a
negative for the gold investor,” said Chad Morganlander, a
 Florham Park , New Jersey-based fund manager at Stifel Nicolaus &
Co. whose company oversees about $130 billion of assets. “As
the economy and the financial system heals itself, gold will
continue to underperform other speculative asset classes.”  Commodity Inflows  Gold funds had inflows of $399 million in the week ended
Sept. 25, according to  Cameron Brandt , the director of research
for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which tracks
money flows. Money managers added $536 million to commodity
funds, the EPFR data show.  The net-long position in crude oil fell 2.1 percent to
275,098 contracts, the lowest since July 2, the CFTC data show.
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade, declined 1.7
percent to $102.87 a barrel last week. Crude inventories grew by
2.64 million barrels in the seven days ended Sept. 20, the first
increase in four weeks, the Energy Information Administration
reported Sept. 25.  Investors are holding a net-long position in copper of
5,284 contracts, up from net-short holding of 3,807 contracts a
week earlier. Futures gained 8.7 percent since June, snapping
three straight quarters of losses.  A measure of net-long  positions  across 11 agricultural
products climbed 11 percent to 299,877 futures and options. The
S&P GSCI Agriculture  Index (BUSY)  of eight commodities added 2.1
percent last week, the biggest increase since July 12.  Cattle Wagers  Bullish cattle  wagers  climbed 38 percent to 39,155
contracts, the biggest gain in six weeks, CFTC data show. Prices
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rose for an eighth straight
session Sept. 27, the longest rally since November 2008, on the
prospect of shrinking U.S. herds.  The S&P GSCI gauge climbed 92 percent from the end of 2008
through June 2011 as record stimulus by the Fed improved demand
for grains, metals and energy products. The U.S. economy will
expand 2.7 percent next year, from 1.6 percent in 2013,
according to the median of as many as 81 economist estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The anticipation is there will be some level of growth
improvement from continued liquidity and  government spending 
coming from QE will ultimately find its way into raw-material
prices,” said Jeffrey Sica, who helps oversee more than $1
billion of assets as the president of Sica Wealth Management in
Morristown,  New Jersey . “It would be positive for commodity
demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
