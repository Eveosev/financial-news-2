A car bomb exploded in a crowded
market today in  Peshawar , killing as many as 34 people and
injuring 74 in the third attack in a week targeting the northern
 Pakistan  city.  “The Kasa Khawani Bazaar was the target,” Feroz Shah,
spokesman for Peshawar’s deputy commissioner, said by phone.
“Initially we thought it was a suicide bomb attack, but later
it became clear, with a car parked in the center of the
market.”  The death toll was confirmed by Shaukat Yousafzai, health
minister for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, who said eight to 10
of the injured are in critical condition.  The latest attack comes two days after 17 government
employees died in an explosion on a bus, and a week after 81
worshipers were killed when two  suicide bombers  struck the
city’s All Saint’s Church on Sept. 22.  Television networks including Geo and Dawn News showed
video footage of shops in flames inside the market, as people
helped the injured to medical assistance. Nine people in a
single family are among the dead, Geo reported.  “Between 200 kilograms to 225 kilograms of bomb material
was used in this attack,” Shafqat Malik, head of the city’s
bomb disposal unit, said at a press briefing broadcast live on
the Geo channel. “This was home-made, combustible material used
in the attack with the intention of causing massive collateral
damage.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
