U.K. financial services firms must
wait an average of almost six months for approval from the U.K.
markets regulator, double the time it took five years ago.  There is an average wait of 25.8 weeks for a new bank or
brokerage to gain approval from the Financial Conduct Authority,
according to statistics compiled by London-based law firm
Reynolds Porter Chamberlain published today. The average wait in
the second quarter of 2008 was 13.9 weeks.  The FCA, formerly known as the Financial Services Authority
until April, had outlined plans in March to cut in half the time
it took startup banks to get approval.  “Such are the delays in getting approval from the
regulator that many very viable financial services businesses
never get off the drawing board”, said Richard Burger, a lawyer
at RPC. “If the FCA continues to scrutinize new startups much
more rigorously than its predecessor, then we can expect to see
long authorization times becoming a big problem.”  The 25.8 week wait is the second-longest in the last five
years, according to RPC. In the second quarter of 2012 new firms
had to wait an average of 25.9 weeks.  “We’re constantly seeking to improve the efficiency of the
authorisation process but there is a balance to be struck
between speed on the one hand and protecting consumers and the
wider financial system on the other,” the FCA said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
