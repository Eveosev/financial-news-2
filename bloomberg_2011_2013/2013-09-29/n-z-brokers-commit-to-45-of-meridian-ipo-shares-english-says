New Zealand brokers have committed
to buy about 45 percent of the Meridian Energy Ltd. shares
available in an initial public offering, Finance Minister Bill English said.  Bids on behalf of existing clients reached 565 million
shares, English said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
offer of 1.26 million shares opens today. New Zealand applicants
will pay no more than NZ$1.60 a share, with the first
installment set at NZ$1.  New Zealand’s government is seeking to raise about NZ$2
billion ($1.7 billion) from the sale of as much as 49 percent of
Meridian, the nation’s largest power generator. The sale is the
second in a program expected to raise NZ$5 billion.  “The initial pre-commitment from New Zealand brokers just
one week after the offer document was lodged is pleasing,”
English said. “Feedback from brokers has been supportive of the
offer, with Meridian’s strong forecast dividend yields, the
price cap and the enhanced dividend yield provided by the
installment payment structure, proving to be attractive.”  The gross yield based on an offer price range of NZ$1.50 to
NZ$1.80 a share is 7.4 percent to 8.9 percent in 2013-14 and 8.2
percent to 9.8 percent a year later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
