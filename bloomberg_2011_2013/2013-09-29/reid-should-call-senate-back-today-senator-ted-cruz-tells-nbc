Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
“should call the Senate back in today” to deal with
legislation passed by the House early this morning that ties an
extension of government funding through Dec. 15 to a delay of
the 2010 health-care law, Senator Ted Cruz said.  “There’s no reason the Senate should be home on
vacation,” said the Texas Republican, who wants to defund
Obamacare, speaking NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  Reid, a Nevada Democrat, in effect, told the American
people to “go jump in a lake” and is forcing the government
into a shutdown, Cruz said. “I hope he backs away from that
ledge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
