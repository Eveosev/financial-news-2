Norwich won 1-0 at Stoke today for
its second victory this season in English soccer’s Premier
League.  Jonny Howson got the goal in the 34th minute. His low shot
beat goalkeeper Asmir Begovic’s dive as Stoke paid the price for
being sloppy in possession.  Later today, Sunderland hosts Liverpool in the Black Cats’
first league game since the firing of coach Paolo Di Canio
He was dismissed Sept. 22 after Sunderland picked up only one
point from the first five league games.  Yesterday, Arsenal moved two points ahead of Tottenham at
the top of the table with a 2-1 win at Swansea.  Defending champion Manchester United was upset 2-1 at home
by West Brom, and has seven points from six games, its worst
start for 24 years. Manchester City lost 3-2 at Aston Villa, and
Chelsea drew 1-1 at Tottenham. Fulham lost 2-1 at home to
Cardiff, Hull defeated West Ham 1-0, and Southampton had a 2-0
victory over Crystal Palace.  Everton, the only unbeaten team in the league, hosts
Newcastle tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
