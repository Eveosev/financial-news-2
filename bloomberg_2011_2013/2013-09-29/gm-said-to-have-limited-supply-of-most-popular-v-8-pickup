General Motors Co. (GM) , introducing its
first redesigned pickups since 2006, can’t make enough of the
most popular versions of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC
Sierra, according to three people familiar with the effort.  Demand for the trucks is exceeding a supplier’s ability to
produce certain drivetrain parts for the 5.3-liter V-8 engine,
the most popular size, and GM is limiting how many dealers can
order, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the matter is private. While one of the people said the
issue could be resolved soon, another said it could take longer
than a couple of months. They declined to identify the supplier.  The Silverado and Sierra are the high-volume, fat-margin
centerpieces of GM’s wave of 18 new or redesigned models for the
U.S. market. Full-size pickups generate $8,000 to $10,000 in
gross profit each, and Detroit-based GM needs to resolve the
shortage quickly to get the most out of its redesigned trucks
before  Ford Motor Co. (F)  brings out a new F-150 next year.  “This is a window of opportunity for GM given the strong
pickup market and the new Ford truck which launches in fall
2014,” Alan Baum, an industry consultant at Baum & Associates
in West Bloomfield, said in an e-mail.  The constrained supply is most noticeable to dealers
accustomed to ordering only V-8 trucks, one of the people said.
The 5.3-liter V-8 is produced at GM plants New York,  Canada  and
 Mexico .  ‘Temporary Thing’  Dealers always want more of the “hot new truck,” said
Terry Rhadigan, a GM spokesman. “It’s a temporary thing.” A
dealer ordering 10 of the 5.3-liter pickups is getting eight of
them, he said. “It’s almost an oxymoron to call it a constraint
at 80 percent.”  GM fell 1.1 percent to $35.97 at the close in New York. The
shares have gained 25 percent this year, outpacing the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index’s 18 percent rise.  U.S. car and light truck sales sold at a seasonally
adjusted annualized rate of 16.1 million in August, the fastest
pace since October 2007, according to researcher Autodata Corp.
GM had said U.S. light-vehicle deliveries this year would total
as much as 15.5 million, a figure its chief economist, Mustafa Mohatarem, said this month will be exceeded. The 16-million
annual sales rate is “here to stay,” he said.  GM’s pickups generated an estimated 16 percent of the
company’s global earnings before interest and taxes last year
and the redesigned versions could  boost EBIT  by more than $1
billion in 2013, according to a Citigroup Inc. estimate.  Engine Options  GM plans to offer the light-duty version of the new pickups
with three engine options, a 4.3-liter V-6, 5.3-liter V-8 and
6.2-liter V-8. The smaller engine began production in August and
the larger V-8 doesn’t arrive in showrooms until later this
year. The 5.3-liter engine made up about 80 percent of the
previous truck’s sales and was expected to be the same going
forward, Baum said.  “Given that the 6.2 is late-availability and the 4.3 is
obviously not as capable as the 5.3, it is a significant issue”
to have limited availability of that engine, Baum said. “That
said, their production volume to date has been strong. The
volume they have been able to achieve as they were making the
changeover” has been impressive.  GM has made the fuel efficiency of its V-8 a key peg of its
marketing during this year’s introduction of the new truck.  The 2014 Silverado with a 5.3-liter V-8 engine and two-wheel drive is  rated  by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
as getting 23 miles (37 kilometers) per gallon in highway
driving. Ford’s 3.5-liter, six-cylinder turbo 2013 F-150 is
rated at 22 mpg on the highway while a flex-fuel version of the
vehicle gets a 23 mpg rating from the EPA. A flex-fuel 5-liter
V-8 F-150 gets a 21 mpg rating for highway driving.  To contact the reporter on this story:
