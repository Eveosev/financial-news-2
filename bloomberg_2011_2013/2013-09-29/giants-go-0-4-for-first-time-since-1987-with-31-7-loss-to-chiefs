The  New England Patriots  improved
to 4-0 for the first time in six years with a 30-23 victory
against the  Atlanta Falcons , while New York’s Giants and Jets
each lost by by more than three touchdowns.  Tom Brady  threw two touchdown passes as the Patriots opened
a 30-13 fourth-quarter lead and held on for the win last night
at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The Falcons scored 10 points in
the final five minutes to pull within a touchdown and reached
New England’s 10-yard line before  Matt Ryan ’s fourth-down pass
fell incomplete with 35 seconds left.  “We’ve got to do a better job of finishing out the game,
but we did a good job of putting ourselves in that position with
a 17-point lead with six minutes to go,” Patriots coach  Bill Belichick  said at his postgame news conference.  New England is among four unbeaten National Football League
teams after four regular-season games, joining the  Kansas City
Chiefs ,  Denver Broncos  and  Seattle Seahawks . The Chiefs rolled
to a 31-7 win over the New York Giants, who are 0-4 for the
first time since 1987, while the Broncos cruised to a 15th
straight regular-season win as  Peyton Manning  threw four
touchdown passes in a 52-20 rout of the Philadelphia Eagles.  The Seahawks pulled out a 23-20 road win against the
Houston Texans on Steven Hauschka’s 45-yard field goal in
overtime after Seattle erased a 17-point second-half deficit.  One more team will be 4-0 after tonight, as the Miami
Dolphins visit the New Orleans Saints in a matchup of 3-0 teams.  The Tennessee Titans rolled past the New York Jets 38-13
yesterday as Jake Locker threw three touchdown passes before
leaving with a hip injury that kept him in a local hospital
overnight. Jets rookie quarterback Geno Smith had four
turnovers, including a fumble that was recovered for a score.  Bears Denied  The Detroit Lions (3-1) held on for a 40-32 win to prevent
the visiting Chicago Bears starting with four victories for the
first time in seven years. The San Diego Chargers (2-2) topped
the Dallas Cowboys (2-2) 30-21 as  Philip Rivers  threw for more
than 400 yards and three touchdowns.  The Washington Redskins picked up their first win of the
season after an 0-3 start, scoring 24 unanswered points in a
24-14 victory over the Oakland Raiders (1-3).  In a matchup of 0-3 teams at Wembley Stadium in London,
Matt Cassel tossed a 70-yard scoring pass to  Greg Jennings  and
 Adrian Peterson  ran for touchdowns of 60 and seven yards as the
Minnesota Vikings beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 34-27.  In a showdown between Ohio rivals Cincinnati and Cleveland,
the Browns beat the Bengals 17-6 to leave both teams with 2-2
records.  Elsewhere in Week 4 it was Buffalo 23, Baltimore 20;
 Arizona  13, Tampa Bay 10; and Indianapolis 37, Jacksonville 3.  Patriots Survive  The Patriots opened the second half by outscoring the
Falcons 20-3 last night in Atlanta, snapping a 10-10 tie as
Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Kenbrell Thompkins,
LeGarrette Blount rushed for a 47-yard score and  Stephen Gostkowski  kicked a pair of field goals.  The Falcons rallied, getting an 11-yard touchdown pass from
Ryan to Tony Gonzalez and then a field goal after recovering an
onsides kick. Atlanta got the ball back again with under two
minutes left as Brady fumbled at the Falcons’ 38-yard line. Ryan
threw a 49-yard pass to Julio Jones on the next play before the
Falcons’ drive stalled, dropping them to 1-3 on the season.
Atlanta went 13-3 last year.  In Denver, the Broncos put up their highest point total of
the season as Manning completed 28-of-34 passes for 327 yards.
He has 16 touchdown passes without an interception as the
Broncos have averaged 44.8 points a game in their 4-0 start.  Broncos’ Scoring  Wes Welker and  Demaryius Thomas  each had two touchdown
catches for Denver, while Trindon Holliday scored on a 105-yard
kickoff return and Steven Johnson returned a blocked punt 17
yards for a touchdown.  In Kansas City, the Chiefs were nursing a 10-7 lead before
Dexter McCluster returned a punt 89 yards for a touchdown with
1:34 left in the third quarter.  Alex Smith  threw fourth-quarter
touchdown passes to Jamaal Charles and Dwayne Bowe, leaving the
Giants as one of four 0-4 NFL teams.  “Our inability to do anything with the ball in the second
half, there’s no excuse for that,” Giants coach  Tom Coughlin 
said at his postgame news conference.  Since the NFL playoffs expanded to the current 12-team
format in 1990, only one team has reached the postseason after
starting the season with four straight losses.  In Nashville, the Titans jumped out to a 24-6 halftime lead
behind three touchdown passes from Locker.  All three scores came after turnovers by Jets’ quarterback
Smith, who also fumbled in the end zone when he was sacked in
the opening minutes of the fourth quarter. The Titans didn’t
have a turnover for the fourth straight game and are now the
only team in the NFL without a giveaway.  Week 4 play began Sept. 26 with the San Francisco 49ers
winning 35-11 at the St. Louis Rams. The  Green Bay Packers  and
Carolina Panthers were off this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
