Egypt expects to receive more aid
from Gulf countries, beyond the $12 billion already pledged by
the  United Arab Emirates , Kuwait and  Saudi Arabia , Egyptian
Central Bank Governor Hisham Ramez said.  Ramez, speaking to reporters today in  Abu Dhabi , also said
foreign currency reserves cover about four months of imports and
that the local market is regaining confidence in the economy.  “The support we’re getting from the Gulf countries is very
important, very helpful, and we appreciate it very much, but we
can’t live depending on this,” Ramez said.  Egypt’s credit growth is about 9 percent will quicken
“once the economy starts moving,” Ramez said. The central bank
has already received $7 billion in aid since the army’s ouster
of President Mohamed Mursi, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
