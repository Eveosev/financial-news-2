Senate Majority Whip  Dick Durbin , a
Democrat from  Illinois , said he thinks there will be a
government shutdown.  “I predict the Senate is going to reject this House
overture that was sent to us last night,” Senator Dick Durbin,
a Democrat from Illinois, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation”
show.  Durbin said only way to avoid a government shutdown is for
House to pass “a clean CR to keep the government in business
and not hurt the economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
