The  New York Rangers  sent forward
Chris Kreider to their American Hockey League affiliate, the
Hartford Wolf Pack, as they trimmed their roster to 24 active
players for opening day.  Kreider on April 16, 2012, became the first player in more
than two decades to win the National Collegiate Athletic
Association championship and debut in that year’s  National
Hockey League  playoffs.  The Rangers in February recalled Kreider, 22, a day after
they demoted him to the AHL team.  New York, which went 1-5 during the preseason, begins the
regular season Oct. 3 at the Phoenix Coyotes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
