Metro-North Railroad is offering
8,600 free park-and-ride spaces in Westchester County and the
Bronx to help commuters traveling to  Manhattan  as its New Haven
Line remains disrupted from a power failure.  “We’re getting back to some level of normalcy,”
 Connecticut  Governor Dannel Malloy said today during a news
briefing. He said the transit system carried over 50 percent of
its normal ridership, with more than 1,000 passengers standing
on trains.  Park-and-ride spaces were set up at Orchard Beach, Yankee
Stadium, Rye Playland and Kensico Dam, the  Metropolitan
Transportation Authority  said in a statement. The MTA operated
as many as 72 shuttle buses from the locations, starting at 5
a.m., to connect riders with other MTA services.  “If you have the option of working from home, this is a
great time to use that,” said Malloy, a 58-year-old Democrat.
“I’m not asking people to forgo their living.”  Full service may be restored by Oct. 8.  Amtrak , which was
also affected, said it will resume limited Acela service today.  Service on the line between Grand Central Station and New
Haven, Connecticut, was disrupted on Sept. 25 by a downed power
cable.  It’s at least the second major disruption on the line this
year. On May 17, two trains collided near the Bridgeport-Fairfield border, injuring at least 75. As many as 30,000 Metro-North users had to find alternative commutes for five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
