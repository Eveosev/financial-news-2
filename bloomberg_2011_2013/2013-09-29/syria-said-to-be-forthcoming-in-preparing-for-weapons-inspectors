Syrian authorities have been
efficient in preparations for the team of inspectors of the
 Organization  for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, that
will arrive in Damascus Oct. 1.  The cooperation from the Syrians was forthcoming and there
is no reason to doubt their intentions, OPCW officials, who
asked not to identified for security reasons, told reporters
today in  The Hague . A team of about 20 OPCW staff will travel to
Damascus tomorrow and will meet Syrian authorities the following
day, the officials said.  The United Nations  Security Council  Sept. 28 unanimously
approved a breakthrough agreement to eliminate all of Syria’s
chemical weapons. The Security Council voted after the Executive
Council of OPCW, the world body in The Hague that monitors
compliance with a global treaty banning the munitions, adopted a
blueprint to verify, remove, and destroy Assad’s arsenal of
sarin and other chemical weapons by mid-2014.  The time line for the team is “challenging” while
security on the ground is an issue, the officials said.  “This decision sends an unmistakable message that the
international community is coming together to work for peace in
 Syria , beginning with the elimination of chemical weapons in
that country,” OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said in a
statement Sept. 28 following the adoption of the UN blueprint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
