results will start to be announced after polls close.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho ’s term in office ends in
2015 and he’s backed by his  Social Democratic Party  and the
smaller conservative CDS party, which together have a majority
of seats in parliament. The Socialists are the biggest
opposition party in parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
