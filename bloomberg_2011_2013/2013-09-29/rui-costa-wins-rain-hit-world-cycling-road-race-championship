Rui Costa of  Portugal  won the men’s
cycling world road race title today after several top riders
abandoned the rain-lashed event.  Costa, 26, beat Spain’s Joaquim Rodriguez in a sprint
finish. Another Spaniard, Alejandro Valverde, was third after
the 272-kilometer (169-mile) event in Florence. Costa had a time
of 7 hours, 25 minutes, 44 seconds.  The entire eight-man British team, including  Tour de France 
champions Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, failed to finish
after heavy rain led to a series of crashes.  Another Tour de France champion,  Cadel Evans  of Australia,
Chris Horner of the U.S., this year’s Tour of Spain winner, and
Colombia’s Nairo Quintana, second in this year’s Tour de France,
also didn’t finish.  “Even before going out on to the circuit there were
crashes everywhere. It’s just the weather, it hadn’t let up all
day,” Froome, who pulled out after Wiggins and compatriot  Mark
Cavendish  crashed, told the British Broadcasting Corp. “It had
been raining solidly and all the drains started flooding, and in
some points on the road it was quite deep with water. People
were trying to move up on the sides but were getting stuck in
the gutters, causing most of the crashes.”  Last year’s champion, Philippe Gilbert of Belgium, came
ninth.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
