Tunisia ’s ruling Ennahda party said
it would step down only after consensus on a new charter and an
election timetable are agreed to, disputing reports it had
agreed to be replaced within weeks by a nonpartisan government.  The denial came hours after Bouali Mbarki, the assistant
secretary general of the UGTT, the country’s top labor union,
said the Islamist party had accepted an initiative stipulating,
among other points, that the current government would resign
within three weeks of the start of a national dialogue.  That Ennahda accepted the activation of the initiative
“implies that the government announces its resignation
concurrently with the start of national dialogue,” Mouldi
Jendoubi, the UGTT’s deputy-secretary General was cited as
saying by Tunisia’s state-run TAP news agency.  Ennahda executive committee member Nour Eddin Arbaoui said
by phone that the party’s position on the conditions for handing
over power hadn’t changed and the prime minister’s office said
“no formal announcement” was made about accepting the
initiative, according to TAP.  The differing interpretation of what the Islamist party had
agreed to underscored the rifts that have paralyzed progress in
the birthplace of the Arab Spring, particularly after the
assassination of a politician in July, the second such killing
in five months.  Ennahda, which won the largest share of seats in the
parliament and is part of a governing troika of parties, has
faced criticism over its handling of the economy and what the
opposition sees as a lax response to rising extremism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
