Andy Pettitte  threw a complete-game
five-hitter in the final outing of his 18-year Major League
Baseball career as the  New York Yankees  beat the Houston Astros
2-1.  Pettitte, 41, a former Astro who grew up and lives in the
Houston area, drew several standing ovations at Minute Maid Park
last night after allowing one earned run while throwing a
season-high 116 pitches to capture his first complete game since
Aug. 16, 2006. He struck out five and walked two, ending the
contest with a J.D. Martinez ground out to third base, stranding
a player on first.  Pettitte, who on Sept. 20 said he’s retiring, raised his
record to 11-11 this season, becoming the only pitcher in major-league history to play more than 15 years without having a
losing season.  “It’s absolutely mind-boggling,” Pettitte said in a
televised interview on the YES Network about throwing a complete
game to end his career. “It just couldn’t end any better.”  Pettitte retires with a 256-153 record and a win total that
ranks 42nd in major-league history.  Leading 2-1 in the bottom of the ninth, Pettitte allowed a
two-out, two-strike single to Chris Carter, prompting a quick
visit to the mound from Yankees manager  Joe Girardi . With
prompting of teammates, Pettitte told Girardi that he wanted to
stay in the game.  Pettitte’s outing came two days after closer  Mariano Rivera , the sport’s all-time leader in saves, pitched his final
game at Yankee Stadium. Rivera, who also is retiring, told
reporters yesterday that he would not be pitching in the series
in Houston, according to YES.  Five Championships  Rivera and Pettitte, along with shortstop  Derek Jeter  and
catcher  Jorge Posada , in 1995 joined a Yankees’ team that went
on to win World Series titles in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000 and
2009.  Pettitte said he spoke to Rivera, known as Mo, just after
pitching the complete game, the 26th of his career.  “I told Mo, ‘See, I might be able to finish some games off
if you’re not out in the bullpen,’” Pettitte said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
