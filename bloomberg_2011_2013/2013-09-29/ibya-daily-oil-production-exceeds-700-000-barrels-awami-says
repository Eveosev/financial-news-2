Libya’s oil production exceeded
700,000 barrels a day, nearly 45 percent of installed capacity,
on higher output from the western region, said Oil Ministry
Measurement Director Ibrahim Al Awami.  The Hamada oil field resumed operations this weekend,
adding 8,000 barrels a day to the North African nation’s crude
production, he said in a telephone interview today.  Protests staged at energy facilities since July by workers
and guards brought production from the eastern  oil fields  to a
near halt. Libya in August produced 575,000 barrels a day, the
lowest level since the 2011 overthrow of  Muammar Qaddafi . The
country has the capacity to produce 1.55 million barrels daily,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Hamada field is sending crude to the Zawiya export
terminal, in western Libya, said Awami.  The field is operated by the Arabian Gulf Oil Co. that is
also producing 23,000 barrels a day from fields in the eastern
region, including Sarir, one of Libya’s largest, and Messla.
Agoco has the capacity to produce 425,000 barrels a day, its
spokesman Abdeljalil Mayuf said in February.  “Current production from Sarir and Messla keeps some oil
flowing in the pipelines, averting a complete shutdown,” said
Awami. Their production is supplying the 20,000 barrel-a-day
refinery in the eastern city of Tobruk, he said.  Libya ’s main producing fields now are El Feel (Elephant),
Sharara, Wafa, Brega, Al Jurf and Bouri, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
