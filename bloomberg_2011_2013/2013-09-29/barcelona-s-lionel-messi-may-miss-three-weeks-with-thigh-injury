Barcelona’s four-time world soccer
player of the year Lionel Messi will be out for up to three
weeks with a thigh injury sustained in yesterday’s 2-0 win at
Almeria.  “Tests carried out this morning have confirmed a small
muscle injury in his right thigh,” the team said on its
website. Messi will miss games against Celtic, in the  Champions
League , and Valladolid, in the Spanish league, before a break
for international matches.  Messi scored the first goal as Barcelona kept its perfect
start to the season with a seventh consecutive win.  Atletico
Madrid  also has full points after a 1-0 win at Real Madrid.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
