The average earnings of directors
of companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market in
 London  rose by almost 12 percent in the past year, according to
a report by  Incomes Data Services .  Median total earnings advanced 5 percent with salaries
rising 3.6 percent, the employment research company said today
in an e-mailed statement. Total earnings for directors of all
small companies increased 4.9 percent on average.  “There are signs that the earnings of directors at small
companies are gathering momentum,” Steve Tatton, editor of the
report, said in the statement. “AIM companies are starting to
show signs of growth alongside the broader economic recovery in
the U.K.”  Companies in Britain have been under mounting pressure to
curb executive remuneration amid an investor revolt dubbed the
shareholder spring. The U.K.’s top 100 CEOs received a 10
percent median increase in total awarded remuneration, according
to a survey earlier this year by proxy voting agency Manifest
and London-based pay consultants  MM&K .  Most directors of AIM companies didn’t receive a bonus last
year, while only 2.7 percent got a long-term incentive plan,
Incomes Data Services said. AIM companies make salary a higher
proportion of total earnings because of the greater potential
for volatile revenue and share-price performance, IDS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
