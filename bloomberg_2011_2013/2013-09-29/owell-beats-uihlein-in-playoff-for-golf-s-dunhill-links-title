David Howell beat Peter Uihlein of
the U.S. in a playoff to win golf’s Alfred Dunhill Links
Championship, his first European Tour crown in seven years.  Howell shot a final-round 67 at  St. Andrews , Scotland, as
he and Uihlein, with a 69, finished on 23-under par in
regulation play. The Englishman clinched victory with a birdie
putt at the second extra hole.  “It’s incredible, the sun is shining and the crowd have
come out,” Howell told the European Tour website. “I have
never played in an Open Championship here but to win a golf
tournament as a professional at the home of golf is quite
amazing and I am really thrilled.”  Howell’s fifth European Tour title came with a check of
495,000 pounds ($798,000). His last tour win was at the 2006  PGA
Championship .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
