Nufarm Ltd., Australia’s largest
supplier of agricultural chemicals, said farmers should welcome
foreign investors to boost competition for their assets.  “It’s a global business, you cannot get away from that,”
Doug Rathbone, managing director of Melbourne-based Nufarm, said
yesterday on the Financial Review Sunday program on  Channel
Nine . “If we close the gate to foreign investment, how do
growers and farmers who want to transact in their business get a
fair price?”  The remarks come as  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) , the
Decatur, Illinois-based company that is the world’s largest corn
processor, awaits approval for its planned A$2.2 billion ($2
billion) takeover of  GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC) , an Australian grain
handler. The buyout for A$12.20 a share, which must be approved
by Australia and China, would give ADM control over seven of the
eight ports that ship grain in bulk from Australia’s east coast.  Australian investors haven’t been “particularly enamored”
of agriculture, Rathbone said.  ADM agreed to buy GrainCorp in April to add a company that
is benefiting from growing demand from Asia. The proposal
underscores a push by companies including  Glencore International
Plc (GLEN)  and Hong Kong-based commodity trader Noble Group Ltd. to
target agricultural assets, betting on rising demand from Asia
as living standards and diets improve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
