The U.K. will spend hundreds of
millions of pounds hiring hundreds of computer experts to allow
the nation to launch cyber attacks if necessary.  “In response to the growing cyber threat, we are
developing a full-spectrum military cyber capability, including
a strike capability,” Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said in
an e-mailed statement. “Increasingly, our  defense budget  is
being invested in high-end capabilities such as cyber and
intelligence and surveillance assets to ensure we can keep the
country safe.”  The creation of the Joint Cyber Reserve will represent a
significant increase in the number of reservists employed in
cyber security, the defence ministry said.  Recruiting will start in October and target three groups:
regular personnel leaving the armed forces; current and former
reservists with the necessary skills; and individuals with no
previous military experience but with technical knowledge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
