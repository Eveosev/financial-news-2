The  Cleveland Indians  clinched one
of the American Leagueâ€™s two wild-card places with a 5-1 win
over the Minnesota Twins in their final regular-season game.  The Tampa Bay Rays assured themselves of at least a tie for
the other AL wild-card berth with a 7-6 win against the Toronto
Blue Jays.  The Rays (91-71) will take the second spot if the Texas
Rangers fail to beat the Los Angeles Angels in their final game
of the Major League Baseball season today.  A win for Texas would leave them tied with the Rays,
setting up a playoff at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas,
tomorrow to determine which team plays the Indians (92-70) two
days later in  Cleveland .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
