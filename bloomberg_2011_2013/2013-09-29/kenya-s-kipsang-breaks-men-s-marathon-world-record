Wilson Kipsang broke the men’s
marathon world record in Berlin, becoming the third Kenyan to
set the mark in the German capital in the past decade.  Kipsang, 31, completed the 26.2-mile (42-kilometer) course
in  2 hours, 3 minutes and 23 seconds  yesterday, taking 15
seconds off his countryman Patrick Makau’s time in the same race
 two years ago .  The past five men’s world marathon records have been set in
Berlin, with  Kenya ’s Paul Tergat starting the streak in 2003.
Haile Gebrselassie of  Ethiopia  produced back-to-back world marks
there in 2007 and 2008.  “Ten years ago, I watched Paul Tergat break the world
record in Berlin, and now I have achieved the dream,” Kipsang
was cited as saying by the International Association of
Athletics Federations. “Looking at my marathon progress and
career so far, I still think I have the potential to run faster.
Anything under 2:03:23 would do.”  Kipsang’s time was the ninth marathon world record to be
set in Berlin in both men’s and women’s events.  Kenyan duo Eliud Kipchoge and Geoffrey Kipsang finished
second and third in the men’s race yesterday in 2:04:05 and
2:06:26, respectively  Florence Kiplagat of Kenya won the women’s race in 2:21:13,
with countrywoman Sharon Cherop second and Irina Mikitenko of
 Germany  third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
