The  University of Southern
California  fired football coach  Lane Kiffin  after the Trojans
lost seven of their past 11 games.  Athletic Director Pat Haden told Kiffin, 38, he was out
when the team arrived in Los Angeles early today following
yesterday’s 62-41 loss at  Arizona  State, USC said in a statement
on its website.  The Trojans are 3-2 this year and have lost both their
opening games in  Pac-12 conference  play for the first time since
2001. Last year, USC became the first school in nearly 50 years
to begin the college football season as the No. 1 team in the
country and end it unranked as it lost five of its last six
games. Kiffin leaves USC with a 28-15 record.  Four months after Kiffin’s arrival at USC in January 2010,
the  National Collegiate Athletic Association  stripped the
Trojans of 30 football scholarships over three seasons and
barred them from the postseason for two years following a four-year investigation. A year later, the school lost its appeal
against the sanctions, which also included the loss of its 2004
national championship.  Kiffin at age 31 became the youngest coach in the  National
Football League ’s modern era when he joined the Oakland Raiders
before the 2007 season. He was fired on Sept. 30, 2008, with a
5-15 record and joined the University of Tennessee two months
later.  Kiffin lasted one season with the Volunteers before moving
to USC as the successor to  Pete Carroll , who resigned after nine
seasons as Trojans coach to join the Seattle Seahawks. Kiffin
was offensive coordinator at USC from 2001-06 under Carroll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
