French presidential candidate
 Francois Hollande  said he is opposed to transferring Greek
sovereignty to the European Union or anyone else, according to
an interview in the Greek newspaper Real News.  The Greek government should be accountable to its people
for the options it chooses to overcome the economic crisis,
Hollande said in the interview. He said the second bailout
package for  Greece , although a positive step forward, was not
enough and without economic development it only buys time, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
