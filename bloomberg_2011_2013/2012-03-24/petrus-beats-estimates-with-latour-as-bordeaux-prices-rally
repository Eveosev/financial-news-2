Chateau Petrus 1988 Pomerol and
Latour 2000 Pauillac both beat estimates at a  Sotheby’s (BID)  auction
in a sign that Bordeaux prices are rallying and demand continues
for rarer Burgundies.  A case of Bordeaux right-bank Petrus fetched 12,338 pounds
($19,580) including a 17.5 percent buyer’s premium at Sotheby’s
in London. Twelve bottles of first-growth Latour 2000 went for
10,575 pounds. These had been given upper hammer-price
valuations of 10,000 pounds and 9,000 pounds respectively.  This London auction underlined the recovery in investor
demand for selected clarets after last year’s slide. The
Bordeaux-based  Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index (LXFW50)  has risen 3 percent
since the start of 2012. It is little changed since early March
after gains in January and February that snapped a six-month
drop, as Chinese collectors focused more on Burgundies and
second-tier Medocs rather than Bordeaux first-growths such as
 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild .  “The market has broadened,” said  Stephen Williams ,
founder of the London-based Antique Wine Company. “Prices of
Lafite reached a level that was unsustainable. We see a much
more conventional market growing in  Asia .”  The most expensive Bordeaux lots in the Sotheby’s sale were
six magnums of Chateau Le Pin 1990 that fetched 28,200 pounds
and a rare 12-bottle case of the same wine that sold for 25,850
pounds. The auction raised 2.76 million pounds, with 98 percent
of 892 lots successful.  Henri Jayer  Among the Burgundies, three bottles of Henri Jayer Vosne-
Romanee Cros Parantoux 1990 sold to an Asian bidder for 42,300
pounds, more than double their presale estimate and the top
price for the sale on March 21.  Jayer, who died in 2006, was one of Burgundy’s most revered
wine-makers. His Cros Parantoux, from a 2.5-acre premier cru
vineyard that was an artichoke field in World War II, has
acquired trophy status after a case of the 1985 vintage fetched
a record HK$2.06 million ($265,645) at  Christie’s International 
in  Hong Kong  last month.  “This Burgundy has a status similar to Romanee-Conti in
Asia at the moment,” Stephen Mould, Sotheby’s London-based
senior director of wine, said in an interview. “Though it’s
always been a rare and expensive wine, that result in Hong Kong
may have had an influence. More names are coming into play,
which is healthy.”  Chambertin Bottles  Armand Rousseau  is another top Burgundy maker attracting
Asian interest. Lots containing four dusty bottles of Rousseau’s
1959 Chambertin sold just above estimate to an Asian buyer for
25,300 euros ($31,172) and 21,850 euros each at Christie’s in
Paris on March 22.  Of the more than $54 million of wine sold in auction rooms
so far this year by the four largest houses  Acker , Sotheby’s,
Christie’s and  Zachys , $27.25 million was raised in Hong Kong,
more than $11 million in  London  and about $7 million in  New
York . The London total exceeded $14 million if sales by Bonhams
and Spectrum Group International Inc. are included, closing the
gap with Asia.  “Market sentiment has improved in the first two months of
2012 and it now seems likely that the correction has run its
course,”  Miles Davis  and William Beck, partners in London-based
Wine Asset Managers LLP, said in a monthly market report e-
mailed March 13. “While it is difficult to say whether we are
now at the start of the next prolonged period of growth, the
return in confidence required for that to happen is more
evident.”  Investors’ attention has focused on the Bordeaux 2009
vintage in recent weeks as U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker 
published his revised assessments of the top wines, leading to
price gains for those producers assigned higher scores.  “The 2009 vintage is very expensive and most brands
command large premiums,” Davis and Beck said. “After the hype
has died down, the medium-term upside must surely be greater for
the high-quality back vintages.”  (Guy Collins and Scott Reyburn write about the art and wine
