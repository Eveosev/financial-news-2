Japan ’s government will ease
regulations on renewable-energy projects to encourage businesses
to increase use of alternative power sources such as solar and
wind, the Nikkei newspaper said.  The Cabinet is expected to approve a set of measures on
March 30 that would make it easier for companies to put solar
panels on roofs and cut the time it takes to do environmental
impact studies for building  wind turbines , the newspaper said,
without saying where it obtained the information.  Power shortages have been a challenge for Japan as 52 of
the nation’s 54 nuclear reactors have been shut in the aftermath
of the meltdowns at  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-
Ichi plant. Kansai Electric Power Co. has said electricity
supply may fall short of peak summer demand by as much as 25
percent in the western region of Kansai, which accounts for
about a fifth of Japan’s economy.  Facilities that generate solar power are currently subject
to restrictions because they are treated as factories, making
businesses unprofitable unless companies choose locations where
land is cheap, the Nikkei said. Changes to the regulations would
make it more affordable to set up solar panels on roofs in high
rent areas around  Tokyo  and Osaka, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
