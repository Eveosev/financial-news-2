(Corrects name of BayernLB unit in second paragraph.)  German savings banks have pulled
out of a deal on restructuring  Bayerische Landesbank (BLGZ)  which may
endanger European Union approval of the lender’s state bail-out,
according to a person familiar with the talks.  The banks have backtracked on an agreement on their level
of contributions toward a restructuring plan that would have
included the sale of its LBS Bayern mortgage lending unit, the
person said on condition of anonymity today because the talks
aren’t public.  Their withdrawal may endanger a deal with EU Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia , who told the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
last week that EU officials were close to an agreement with the
bank’s owners, which include the German state of Bavaria, on the
terms for EU approval of BayernLB’s bailout.  The  European Commission , the EU’s executive arm in
Brussels, is examining the restructuring measures of lenders
that needed state aid during the financial crisis. While
regulators approved  Germany ’s bailout packages for HSH Nordbank
AG and  WestLB AG (WESTLB)  last year, they are still holding discussions
with Munich-based BayernLB.  The bank is Germany’s second-biggest state-owned lender,
and the last of the nation’s so-called Landesbanken to await the
EU’s verdict on its bailout conditions.  The commission has required banks to shrink balance sheets
and sell off assets to compensate for the harm to competition
arising from state aid. As a last resort, it can force
authorities to recoup the aid they have provided.  To contact the reporters on this story:
