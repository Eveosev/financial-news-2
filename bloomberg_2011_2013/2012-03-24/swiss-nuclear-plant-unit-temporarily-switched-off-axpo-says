A unit of the nuclear power plant
in Beznau,  Switzerland , has been temporarily shut down, operator
Axpo Holding AG said.  The plantâ€™s Block 2 was switched off because of a
malfunction in the main reactor pump, Axpo said in a  statement 
on its website yesterday. The repairs may take several days, the
operator said. At no point was there any risk to the population,
Axpo added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
