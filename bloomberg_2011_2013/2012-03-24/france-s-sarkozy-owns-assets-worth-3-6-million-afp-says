French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said he owns assets worth 2.7 million euros ($3.6 million),
 Agence France-Presse  said, citing a report by the country’s
Constitutional Court.  Sarkozy, who is running for re-election in May, said he
holds no real-estate or market assets, the news service said. He
declared his wealth mainly stems from two life insurance
contracts, a stake in a law firm and several collections of
watches, statues and autographs, AFP reported.  Sarkozy is required by law to declare his wealth before the
ballot and the court has to make it public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
