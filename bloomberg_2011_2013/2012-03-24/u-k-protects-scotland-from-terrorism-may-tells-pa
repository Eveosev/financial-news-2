Scotland  is better protected from
terrorism if it stays part of the U.K., Home Secretary Theresa May told the Scottish Conservative conference, according to the
Press Association.  “Working together we are fighting the scourge of
international terrorism,” she told the conference in Troon,
Scotland, according to the news service.  Alex Salmond , who runs Scotland’s semi-autonomous
government, plans a vote on independence in the second half of
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
