German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
the  Christian Democratic Union  are open to concessions on the
euro-area rescue pact in order to win approval from opposition
parties, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said on its website today,
without saying where it got the information.  Volker Kauder , parliamentary chief of the CDU and its
Bavarian Christian Social Union sister party, wants to meet next
week with counterparts from the Free Democrats, Social Democrats
and Green Party, the newspaper said, citing unidentified
political sources.  Some sort of financial-market participation in the cost of
the euro crisis is among points the CDU is ready to discuss, the
newspaper said. The CDU isnâ€™t open to Germany being the only, or
one of only a few, European Union countries to implement a
financial-transaction tax, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
