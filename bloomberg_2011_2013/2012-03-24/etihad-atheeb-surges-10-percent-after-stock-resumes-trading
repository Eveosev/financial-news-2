Etihad Atheeb Telecom Co. (EAT)  rose 10
percent, or the maximum fluctuation allowed in a trading
session, as the Saudi phone company resumed trading after a 10-
month suspension.  The  shares  advanced to 13.60 riyals at 11:01 a.m. in
Riyadh. The price of the stock was amended to 12.40 riyals after
shareholders approved a plan on Aug. 6 to lower the capital of
the Riyadh-based company and on Jan. 14 to raise it, the Saudi
Stock Exchange said in a statement on March 21.  The Saudi markets regulator suspended trading in Atheebâ€™s
shares from May 25, 2011 after the company reported a wider loss
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
