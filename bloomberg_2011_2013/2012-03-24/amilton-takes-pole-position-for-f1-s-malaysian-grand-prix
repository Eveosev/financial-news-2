Lewis Hamilton  will start in the
pole position for a second straight Formula One race at
tomorrow’s Malaysian Grand Prix after qualifying just ahead of
McLaren teammate  Jenson Button .  Hamilton posted a lap time of 1 minute, 36.219 seconds to
lead qualifying at the Sepang International Circuit today, 0.15
seconds faster than Button. Record seven-time champion  Michael Schumacher  of Mercedes was third-fastest and Red Bull’s Mark Webber fourth.  It’s the highest qualifying position for Schumacher since
he returned in 2010 after three years away. “We definitely have
a much-improved car compared to last season,” Schumacher, 43,
told a televised news conference. He hasn’t won a race since his
return.  Defending champion Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull will start
in fifth place. Kimi Raikkonen, fifth-fastest for the Lotus team,
will start 10th after getting a five-place penalty because his
car needed a new gearbox. Teams are required to use gearboxes
for at least five straight races under series rules.  Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa will start in eight and
12th place, respectively, on the 24-car starting grid after
their Ferraris were more than 1.3 seconds off the pace.  Button won the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in
 Melbourne  on March 18. Vettel was second and Hamilton third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
