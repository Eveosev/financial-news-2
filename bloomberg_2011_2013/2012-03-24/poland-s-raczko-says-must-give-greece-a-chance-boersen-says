The European Union should “give
 Greece  a chance” and consider offering additional aid if the
troika deems it necessary,  Boersen-Zeitung  cited Andrzej Raczko,
a member of the Polish central bank’s management board, as
saying in an interview.  Raczko said he expects growth in the euro area to return in
2013, according to the newspaper. Poland may adopt the euro
“when we see strong signals that the problems within the euro
zone are solved,” the newspaper quoted him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
