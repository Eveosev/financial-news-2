The U.K. plans to introduce
measures to stop individuals avoiding tax by channeling their
income through companies,  Danny Alexander , the chief secretary
of the Treasury, told the Times in an interview.  The Treasury has found hundreds of examples of people being
paid “off the payroll,” Alexander said, according to the
Times, allowing them to pay the U.K. corporation tax rather than
a higher income tax rate.  “I launched an investigation,” Alexander told the
newspaper. “Everyone should pay the right amount of tax.”  The Times didn’t report what measures are under
consideration or when they might be put in place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
