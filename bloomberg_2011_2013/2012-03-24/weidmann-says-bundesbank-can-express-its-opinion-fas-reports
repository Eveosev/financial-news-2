Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said it’s important for central banks to be able to express
independent opinions,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung 
said, citing an interview.  “If we as the Bundesbank have an opinion, we will say
it,” the newspaper quoted Weidmann as saying in an e-mailed
preview of an interview to be published tomorrow. “It can’t
always be only about calming the markets.”  The independence of the Bundesbank and its European
counterparts “can’t be called into question just because it
seems convenient during the European crisis,” the newspaper
cited Weidmann as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
