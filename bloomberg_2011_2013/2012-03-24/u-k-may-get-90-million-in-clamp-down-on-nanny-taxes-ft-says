The U.K. may claim an additional 57
million pounds ($90 million) in  tax revenue  by finding families
who avoid tax by paying their nannies in cash, the Financial
Times reported, citing Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.  About 6,000 nannies surveyed in a 2009 report said they
worked without tax or national insurance payments on their
average salaries of 27,000 pounds, the newspaper said, implying
a tax evasion of 57 million pounds. Parents who aren’t paying
the tax may face fines of as much as 46,000 pounds, the
newspaper said.  “It’s not particularly hard to find them,” the HMRC said,
according to the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
