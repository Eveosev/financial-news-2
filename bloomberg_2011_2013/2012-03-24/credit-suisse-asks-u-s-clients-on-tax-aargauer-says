Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  asked U.S.
clients to confirm they filed their 2010 United States tax
return,  Aargauer Zeitung  said, citing unnamed employees and an
Switzerland-based client with both U.S. and Swiss citizenship.  The lender also asked U.S. clients to disclose the name of
their tax consultants, the newspaper said, adding that Credit
Suisse sent letters to as many as 4,000 clients. The bank will
end its relations with account holders who don’t disclose the
details by April 23, the newspaper said.  The letters were sent as part of the bank’s efforts to
ensure its clients comply with U.S. tax regulations, Credit
Suisse spokesman  Marc Dosch  said via phone. He declined to
comment on the number of letters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
