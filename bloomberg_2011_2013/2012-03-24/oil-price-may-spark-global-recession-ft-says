High  oil prices  are the biggest
risk to the global economy and may cause a recession, the
Financial Times quoted International Energy Agency chief
economist  Fatih Birol  as saying.  Current price levels are on average higher than in 2008
when the oil price hit a record of $147 a barrel, Birol said
yesterday in a speech in London, according to the newspaper.  The European Union will spend $502 billion on net imports
of oil this year, the U.S. $426 billion and China $251 billion,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
