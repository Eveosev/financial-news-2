Greggs Plc (GRG) , a maker of baked goods,
will lobby the U.K. government to prevent a budget proposal to
tax hot food sold in bakeries and supermarkets, the Journal
 reported , citing Chief Executive Officer Ken McMeikan.  Greggs and other bakers will meet with the Treasury to
discuss the proposal during a consultation period, the newspaper
reported. The talks are to last six weeks, the Journal cited
McMeikan as saying. The introduction of such tax would have “a
big impact,” McMeikan said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
