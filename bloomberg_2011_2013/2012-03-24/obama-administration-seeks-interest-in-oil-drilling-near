The Obama administration is seeking
input from the oil and gas industry to explore drilling off the
coast of south-central  Alaska , according to a statement from the
U.S. Department of Interior.  The administration said its  “request for interest” is a
step in the planning for a potential oil and natural gas lease
sale in the Cook Inlet.     The rising cost of gasoline
threatens to slow the U.S. recovery and is emerging as an issue
in the 2012 presidential campaign. President  Barack Obama  spent
two days last week promoting development of alternative energy
sources, a favorite of environmentalists, while also echoing
Republican calls to expand the use and production of fossil
fuels.  The Interior Department said its request for interest
“does not indicate a decision to lease in the Cook Inlet
planning area.”  The effort is “part of our commitment to increasing safe
and responsible oil and gas production as part of an all-of-the-
above energy strategy for America,” Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  said in a statement given to reporters traveling on Air
Force One as President Barack Obama flew to  South Korea  to
attend the Nuclear Security Summit.  The  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management  won’t make a decision
about any potential lease sale before completing the 2012-2017
leasing program and determining whether there is adequate
interest in holding the sale and conducting further
environmental reviews.  To contact the reporter on this story:
