More than half the 222,990
participants in a  Hong Kong  mock election rejected all three
candidates who are competing to be the city’s chief executive in
a ballot today, Radio Television Hong Kong reported, citing  Hong
Kong University .  Some 121,000 of the participants, or 55 percent, in the
mock election said they didn’t support any of the three men
vying to be chief executive, Hong Kong University’s Public
Opinion Program said, according to RTHK.  Among participants who did pick a candidate, 17.8% chose
Leung Chun-ying, 16.3% selected  Henry Tang , and 11.4% went for
Albert Ho, RTHK said, citing Hong Kong University.  The mock election was held March 23 and 24. Participants
could vote in booths at Hong Kong University or online.  A 1,193-member committee of billionaires, including Hong
Kong’s richest man  Li Ka-shing , lawmakers and academics cast
their votes for the three candidates starting at 9 a.m. today at
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center. Leung, the
favorite in opinion polls, and Tang, a former chief secretary,
secured the most nominations.  The next chief executive will be the last to be chosen by a
narrow group in the former British colony, with China having
pledged to introduce universal suffrage in 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
