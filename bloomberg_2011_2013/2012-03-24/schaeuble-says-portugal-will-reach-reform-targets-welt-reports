German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he has “great trust” in Portugal’s ability to
meet “necessary reform targets,”  Welt am Sonntag  reported.  Portugal will return to a “path to growth,” the newspaper
cited the minister as saying in an e-mailed preview of an
article to be published tomorrow. Portugal is on track to
receiving its next rescue payment of about 15 billion euros ($20
billion) in April, Welt am Sonntag cited a report by the
European Central Bank, European Commission and  International
Monetary Fund  as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
