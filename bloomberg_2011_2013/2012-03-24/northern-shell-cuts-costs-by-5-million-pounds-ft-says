Northern & Shell Plc, owner of the
U.K.  Daily Star  tabloid, plans to slash costs by 5 million
pounds ($7.9 million), the Financial Times reported, without
saying how it got the information.  The company may cut about 70 job cuts and senior management
held talks with trade unions yesterday, the newspaper said.
Northern & Shell currently has nearly 500 employees, according
to the FT.  Executives at the media company are also considering
whether to keep the Sunday edition of the Daily Star, following
the launch of  News Corp. (NWSA) â€™s Sun on Sunday last month, according
to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
