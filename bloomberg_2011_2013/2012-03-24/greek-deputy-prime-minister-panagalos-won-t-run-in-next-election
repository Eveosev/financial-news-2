(Corrects spelling of Pangalos’s name in headline and
second paragraph.)  Greek Deputy Prime Minister
Theodoros Pangalos said he won’t run in the nation’s next
general election, which is likely to occur in April or May.  “I will not be a candidate in the election,” Pangalos
said in an interview broadcast on state-run  NET TV  today. “I am
74 years old and have been in parliament for 32 years.”  Pangalos told NET that Pasok and  New Democracy , the
country’s two largest parties currently supporting the interim
government of  Lucas Papademos , are unable to govern together
even after they agreed to implement economic and structural
reforms.  Pangalos, who holds a law and economics degree, was deputy
prime minister under the government of  George Papandreou  and
retained the post under Papademos. He has served as transport
and communications, foreign and culture minister under previous
Pasok governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
