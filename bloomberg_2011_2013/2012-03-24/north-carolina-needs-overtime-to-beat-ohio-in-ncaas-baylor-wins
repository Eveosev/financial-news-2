Top-seeded  North Carolina  needed
overtime to defeat 13th-seeded Ohio 73-65 and avoid an upset in
the menâ€™s national college basketball tournament.  Tyler Zeller  had 20 points and 23 rebounds for the Tar
Heels (32-5) in the Midwest Regional semifinals at the Edward
Jones Dome in St. Louis. North Carolina will play either Kansas
or North Carolina State in the regional final.  Walter Offutt had 26 points before fouling out in overtime
for the Bobcats (29-8). Offutt scored on a layup with 26 seconds
remaining in regulation time to tie the game at 63-63 and then
missed a free throw that would have completed a three-point play
and given Ohio the lead.  The Tar Heels were playing without starting point guard
Kendall Marshall, who fractured his right wrist earlier in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  In the South Regional, third-seeded Baylor (30-7) opened
the game with a 22-4 run and never trailed in its 75-70 win
against Xavier to reach the regional final against either top-
seeded Kentucky or No. 4  Indiana .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
