German 10-year bunds posted their
biggest weekly gain this year as signs that global growth is
slowing boosted demand for the euro area’s safest assets.  Two-year notes also rose the most since December after
industry data showed euro-region manufacturing and services
shrank more than economists forecast.  Spain ’s 10-year yields
climbed for a third week after Citigroup Inc. chief economist
 Willem Buiter  said the nation faced an increasing risk of
requiring a debt restructuring. Greek securities maturing in
February 2023 fell to their lowest since the nation secured the
largest debt restructuring in history.  “People still aren’t wholeheartedly convinced that all
 Europe ’s problems are solved,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income
strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in  London . “There
are still some clear implementation risks around Europe, and
that’s keeping an underlying bid in bunds.”  The German 10-year yield fell 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, in the week to 1.87 percent at 4:11 p.m.
London time yesterday. That was the steepest decline since the
period ending Dec. 16. The yield rose 26 basis points the
previous week, the most since Nov. 25.  The 2 percent bond due January 2022 rose 1.51, or 15.10
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,323) face amount, to 101.060. The two-
year note yield was at 0.24 percent, from 0.33 percent a week
ago, the biggest five-day drop since Dec. 16.  Chinese Manufacturing  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing fell to 48.7 in March
from 49.3 in February, London-based Markit Economics said March
22. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. A preliminary
index of  China  manufacturing from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics dropped to 48.1 from 49.6 in the previous month.  Spain is at “a greater risk than ever before” of a debt
restructuring, Buiter said in an interview with  Tom Keene  and
Ken Prewitt on Bloomberg Radio on March 21. “Spain is the key
country about which I’m most worried.” The country has “moved
to the wrong side of the spectrum,” he said.  Spain’s  10-year (GSPG10YR)  bonds have fallen for nine of the past 10
days, with the yield rising 19 basis points last week to 5.39
percent. The yield on similar-maturity Italian  debt  rose 20
basis points to 5.06 percent.  The yield on Greek securities due February 2023 rose to
20.16 percent from 18.45 percent on March 12, when the bonds
began trading.  German Confidence  A report next week will show German business confidence
stayed close to a seven-month high this month, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the data is
released March 26.  Prices rose 0.4 percent in  Germany  in March, after gaining
0.9 percent the previous month, the Bundesbank will say in a
provisional estimate on March 28, according to a separate
survey.  The European Financial Stability Facility bailout fund sold
a total of about 7.5 billion euros of six-month, five-year and
20-year debt this week. Germany will auction 3 billion euros of
12-month bills on March 26, while Spain, France and  Italy  also
plan to sell short-term debt.  German bunds have lost 0.4 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italian bonds have added 12
percent and Spanish securities 0.5 percent.  -- Editors: Mark McCord, Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporters on this story:
