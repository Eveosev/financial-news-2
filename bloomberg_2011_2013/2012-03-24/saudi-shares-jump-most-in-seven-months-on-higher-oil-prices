Saudi Arabian shares advanced the
most in seven months as rising  oil prices  lifted petrochemicals
companies and offset weaker-than-estimated U.S. housing data.  The Tadawul All Share Index climbed 1.8 percent, the
steepest increase since Aug. 13, to 7,675.61, at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Riyadh. Ten shares rose for every stock that fell. The
152-member index has gained 20 percent this year.  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR) , a Saudi lender part-owned by Credit
Agricole SA, surged the most in a year.  Saudi Basic Industries
Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest petrochemicals maker, gained for a
second day.  “Investors are optimistic about petrochemical exports with
oil prices rising,” said Turki Fadaak, head of research at
Riyadh-based Albilad Investment Co.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 1.4 percent to settle at
$106.87 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday.
It touched $108.25 a barrel, the highest intraday price since
March 2, after Reuters reported Iranian oil exports will drop by
300,000 barrels a day this month because of tighter sanctions.  A Chinese manufacturing index dropped this month while
euro-area services and manufacturing output shrank more than
forecast. In the U.S., new home sales fell for a second month in
February and purchases of previously owned houses missed
economists’ expectations.  Banque Saudi soared 5.7 percent, the biggest advance since
March 26, 2011, to 46.50 riyals. Sabic gained 0.9 percent to 107
riyals, the highest price since July 25.  Etihad Atheeb Telecom Co. (EAT)  rose 10 percent, or the maximum
fluctuation allowed in a trading session, to 13.60 riyals as the
Saudi phone company resumed trading after a 10-month suspension.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
that opens on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
