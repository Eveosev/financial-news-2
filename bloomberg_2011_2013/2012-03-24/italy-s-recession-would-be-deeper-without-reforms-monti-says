Italy ’s recession would be deeper
without the reforms its government is implementing, Prime
Minister  Mario Monti  said.  “I cannot promise growth in 2012, but less recession,”
Monti said at a conference in Cernobbbio, Italy, today. “Italy
is not in a brilliant situation and the emergency stage cannot
be solved in a year.”   The government action allowed spreads to narrow, helping
banks, companies and families, Monti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
