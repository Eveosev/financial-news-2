A Belgian parliamentary committee
investigating the failure of  Dexia SA (DEXB)  will recommend that
lenders should be forced to put firewalls between their retail
and investment arms, Le Soir reported, citing lawmakers involved
in the talks.  The committee, which completed its work yesterday, will
also call for the creation of a European Union-wide banking
regulator and for curbs on the ability of elected officials to
hold management positions at banks, the paper said.  Dexia, based in Brussels and Paris, is being broken up
after last year losing access to short-term funding. The bank
has said that disposal losses, additional writedowns on Greek
bonds and a slide in the value of other government debt depleted
its  shareholders’ equity .  The bank in February reported a  record loss  of 11.6 billion
euros ($15.4 billion) for 2011, compared with profit of 723
million euros for the prior year. Dexia’s own funds dropped to a
negative 2.02 billion euros from 1.13 billion euros at the end
of September.  The committee’s report is non-binding and will be debated
in parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
