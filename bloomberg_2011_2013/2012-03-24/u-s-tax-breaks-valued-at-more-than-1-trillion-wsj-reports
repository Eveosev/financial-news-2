The value of U.S. tax breaks
exceeds $1 trillion, which may give both parties potential areas
to cut costs and alleviate the cost of changing the  tax code ,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a study.  The Congressional Research Service report found the biggest
tax break is likely to be valued at $164 billion annually in
2014 and is on employer-provided health insurance, while
employer-provided pensions are the second-biggest exclusion at
about $163 billion, the newspaper said.  The study said the most that might be gained in additional
 tax revenue  from eliminating tax breaks was $150 billion,
because of political opposition and technical hurdles, the
newspaper said.  Lawmakers might only be able to reduce tax rates by one or
two percentage points for the top individual rate, the Journal
said, citing the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
