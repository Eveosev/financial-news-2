Drew Stafford scored two goals for
the  Buffalo Sabres  in their 4-1 defeat of the National Hockey
League’s Eastern Conference-leading  New York  Rangers.  The Rangers (46-21-7) are atop the conference with 99
points, 12 points more than the second-seeded  Boston Bruins . New
York, which already has clinched a playoff spot, leads the
Atlantic Division by one point over the  Pittsburgh Penguins .  Buffalo is third in the Northeast Division, five points
behind Boston and ninth in the conference, 17 points behind New
York.  Travis Turnbull gave the Sabres a 1-0 lead three minutes,
14 seconds into the second period last night at Madison Square
Garden in New York. Brian Boyle tied the game at 1-1 six minutes
later before Stafford scored his first goal with just more than
six minutes to go in the period.  Rangers coach John Tortorella said Stafford’s first goal
“really killed us.”  “We gave that one up when we had full control of the puck
and really maybe a chance to score another goal ourselves,” he
said.  Tyler Ennis and Stafford added goals in the final six
minutes of the third period for the Sabres (36-29-10).  To contact the reporter on this story:
