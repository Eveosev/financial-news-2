German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  have abandoned their
opposition to combining the two euro-area rescue funds,  Der
Spiegel  reported, citing unnamed government officials.  The two German leaders have agreed that the permanent and
temporary rescue funds may be “held in operation” for a
transitional period, the magazine said in an e-mailed preview of
its article. Two variations are in discussion, Spiegel said.  One possibility would add some 200 billion euros ($265.3
billion) in temporary European Financial Stability Facility
funding already promised to  Greece , Portugal and Ireland to the
500 billion euros planned under the permanent European Stability
Mechanism, the magazine said. The second option would allow the
funds to run parallel at a full combined capacity of 940 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
