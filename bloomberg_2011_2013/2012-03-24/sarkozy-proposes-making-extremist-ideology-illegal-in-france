French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said he will propose new rules to fight terrorism, including a
law that would make it unlawful to “propagate and praise
extremist ideology.”  Campaigning in Reuil-Malmaison, France, Sarkozy said he
would increase security measures after an Islamic terrorist
killed seven people this month. The president, who is running
for re-election in the May ballot, also promised to crack down
on illegal immigration.  Socialist candidate  Francois Hollande , holding a meeting on
the island of Corsica, blamed Sarkozy for not improving security
in France in five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
