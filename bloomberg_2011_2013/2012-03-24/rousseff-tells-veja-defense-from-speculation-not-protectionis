Brazil  has to defend itself from
speculative foreign capital inflows, which is different than
protectionism, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said in an
interview published in  Veja magazine  today.  The speculation isn’t a matter of “aggression” by
developed economies toward emerging markets such as Brazil,
though more a consequence of those nations trying to jump-start
their economic recoveries, Rousseff is quoted as telling the Sao
Paulo-based publication in its March 28 edition.  When the  European Central Bank  increases liquidity in the
market by 1 trillion euros, the president said, it can’t expect
countries to do nothing to stem the speculation that leaves no
benefit behind for the emerging-market nation.  Rousseff is quoted as saying she agrees with Brazilian
industrialists who say taxes are too high and keep local
companies from competing globally. She vowed to reduce the tax
burden so investment can increase, though the article didn’t
provide more specifics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
