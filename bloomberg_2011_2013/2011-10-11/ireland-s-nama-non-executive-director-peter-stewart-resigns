Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency said Peter Stewart, a financial consultant, resigned as a
non-executive of the agency.   Stewart, a partner with O’Donovan Stewart, Chartered
Accountants, said in a statement this is “an important juncture
for my decision, particularly with the completion of the review
of the structures of NAMA by the former chief executive of HSBC,
 Michael Geoghegan .”  The review should result in “significant changes to the
structures of the agency,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
