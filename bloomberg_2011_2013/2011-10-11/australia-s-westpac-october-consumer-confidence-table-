Following is the table for  Australia ’s October
consumer confidence index from Westpac Banking Corp. and the Melbourne
Institute released in Sydney. Beginning February 2007 Westpac has resumed
reporting seasonally adjusted figures. Monthly calculations are based on the 
data provided by the Melbourne Institute.  Note: Westpac has resumed reporting seasonally adjusted figures, noting that
research indicated monthly changes in January were generally significantly
larger than monthly changes during the rest of the year. As a result a new
methodology has been adopted to filter raw data and is the new consumer
sentiment index.              Sources: Westpac Banking Corp., Melbourne Institute  To contact the reporter on this story:
