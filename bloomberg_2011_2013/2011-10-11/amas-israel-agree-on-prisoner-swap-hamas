The Palestinian Hamas movement and
 Israel  have reached an agreement with Egyptian mediation to free
captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in exchange for hundreds
of prisoners in Israeli jails, Hamas officials said.  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  called an
emergency Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem to approve the deal.
Netanyahu sees a real possibility that it will lead to the
release of Shalit after five years of captivity in the  Gaza
Strip , said a government official who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the Cabinet is still studying the agreement.  “We fully confirm that an agreement on Shalit’s deal was
reached with Israel and the implementation will be in the coming
few days after finishing all other arrangements,” said Abu
Obeida, a spokesman for the Hamas armed wing known as the
Izzedein al-Qassam Brigades, speaking in a telephone interview
from Gaza.  The deal was previously reported by  Al Arabiya , which said
Israel had agreed to free 1,000 prisoners in exchange for
Shalit. Musa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, said reports
that an agreement had been struck were true, without giving
further details.  Shalit was seized by militants connected to Hamas and other
Palestinian groups in a June 2006 attack on an Israeli army
outpost on the border with Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas.
The Islamic movement is considered a terrorist organization by
Israel, the U.S. and the European Union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
