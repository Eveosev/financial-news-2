The yield on Dubai Holding
Commercial Operations bond and on  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) ’s sukuk
fell as  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES)  said it will take over Dubai Bank.  The rate on Dubai Holding’s 4.75 percent bond maturing
January 2014 dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to 17.86 percent, the lowest in a week, at 11:12 a.m. in Dubai.
The yield on Emaar’s 8.5 percent sukuk maturing August 2016 fell
eight basis points to 8.94 percent, according to Bloomberg
prices.   Dubai Bank, an Islamic lender owned by Dubai Holding LLC
and Emaar, was rescued by Dubai’s government in May after loan
losses increased. Dubai Holding, a company owned by Dubai’s
ruler, held a 70 percent stake in Dubai Bank, while Emaar owned
the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
