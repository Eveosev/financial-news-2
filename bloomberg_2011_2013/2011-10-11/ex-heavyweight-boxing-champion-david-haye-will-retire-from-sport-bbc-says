Former heavyweight champion David
Haye, who lost his World Boxing Association championship belt in
a defeat to Wladimir Klitschko in July, is to retire from the
sport, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Haye e-mailed the British Boxing Board of Control to say
that he did not want to renew his license, the board’s secretary
Robert Smith  told BBC Radio 5 Live .  Haye, who previously said he would not box beyond age 30,
is 31 in two days. Smith told the  BBC  that Haye “has been very
good to the sport and we wish him well.”  The Briton was beaten in a unanimous decision by Ukraine’s
Klitschko in Hamburg in a title unification fight. There was
speculation Haye might have delayed retirement to fight
Klitschko’s brother Vitali, holder of the World Boxing Council
title, the BBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
