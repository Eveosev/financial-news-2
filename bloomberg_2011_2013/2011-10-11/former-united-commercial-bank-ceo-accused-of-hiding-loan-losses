Two former United Commercial Bank
executives were accused by the Securities and Exchange
Commission of misleading investors about loan losses during the
financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.   Thomas Wu, the former chief executive officer, and Ebrahim
Shabudin, the operating chief, concealed loans that led to the
the bankâ€™s public holding company UCBH Holdings Inc. to
understate 2008 operating losses by at least $65 million, or
about 50 percent, the SEC  claimed .   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
