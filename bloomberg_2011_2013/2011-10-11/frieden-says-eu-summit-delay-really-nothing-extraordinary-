Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc
Frieden said the decision to postpone a European Union summit on
the debt crisis by five days to Oct. 23 is “really nothing
extraordinary.”  “There’s no obvious solution,” Frieden told reporters in
Luxembourg today. “There are several options that must be
examined from the technical and political points of view. The
more time we have within a reasonable timeframe, the better our
chances of coming up with something efficient that helps to
solve the ongoing market turbulence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
