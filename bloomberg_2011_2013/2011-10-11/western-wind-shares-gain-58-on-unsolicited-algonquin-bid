Western Wind Energy Corp. (WND) , a
Vancouver-based renewable energy developer, staged its biggest
rally in more than a decade after Algonquin Power & Utilities
Corp. made an unsolicited bid of C$2.50 a share to buy the
company.  Western Wind jumped 58 percent to C$2.10 in Toronto, the
largest increase since June 14, 2001.  Western Wind, which is developing wind and solar power
projects in the U.S. and  Canada , has a 120 megawatt wind farm
becoming operational in three months that will bring returns to
shareholders “well above” the Algonquin offer, Western Wind
said today in a statement.  “This is an extremely low-ball bid to purchase 100 percent
of the common shares of Western Wind Energy,” the company said
in the statement, which recommended that shareholders “ignore”
the offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
