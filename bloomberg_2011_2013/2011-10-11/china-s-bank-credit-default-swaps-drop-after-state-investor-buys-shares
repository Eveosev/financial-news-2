Credit-default swaps insuring
 China ’s bank debt fell after state-run Central Huijin Investment
Ltd. started buying stock.  The cost of protecting debt of  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  against
non-payment for five years declined 13.5 basis points to 297.5
basis points as of 4:17 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data
provider CMA. Contracts on China Development Bank Corp.’s debt
fell 8.2 to 330.1. A decrease signals improving perceptions of
credit quality.  Central Huijin, set up to hold the government’s stakes in
the banks, boosted its holdings after valuations sank below
levels during the global financial crisis. The arm of China’s
sovereign wealth fund began buying shares of  Agricultural Bank
of China Ltd. (601288) , Bank of China,  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  and
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. from today and will
continue with “related market operations,” it said on its
website, without providing further details.  Five-year contracts protecting Chinese government debt
against default fell 2.1 basis points to 154.5 basis points
yesterday, the lowest level since Sept. 21, according to CMA,
which compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The contracts were quoted 9 basis points lower today at
147.5 as of 2:20 p.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc prices show. A close of 147.5 would be the lowest since
Sept. 21, CMA prices show. Contracts protecting the debt of
Export-Import Bank of China against non-payment fell 15.8 to
280.2 basis points, CMA prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
