Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
Latin America’s largest publicly traded utility, will bid for a
21.5 percent stake in EDP Energias de Portugal SA by Oct. 21,
Chief Executive Officer Jose da Costa Carvalho Neto said.  Eletrobras, as the utility is known, will get  project
financing  from Brazil’s national development bank, or BNDES, he
told reporters today in Sao Paulo. The company doesn’t plan to
sell shares or bonds, Costa Neto said. Eletrobras and BNDES will
meet this week to decide the amount of the financing.  “We have our limit, but we are not getting into this to
lose,” Costa Neto said, declining to comment on the value of
the bid. “It is a great opportunity.”  The stake, being sold by the  Portuguese government , is one
of the measures the government pledged in exchange for a 78
billion-euro ($112 billion) bailout from the European Union and
the  International Monetary Fund  earlier this year.  Lisbon-based EDP, which has a market value of 8.76 billion
euros, is Portugal’s largest electricity company. EDP declined
to comment, according to an e-mailed response to Bloomberg News.  Banco Santander SA is advising Eletrobras on the bid  Eletrobras rose 42 centavos, or 1.9 percent, to 22.25 reais
