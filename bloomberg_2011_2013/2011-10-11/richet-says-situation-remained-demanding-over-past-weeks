European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said the situation remained “demanding”

said at a hearing in Brussels today. “Sovereign stress has
moved from smaller economies to some of the larger countries.
The crisis is systemic and must be tackled decisively.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
