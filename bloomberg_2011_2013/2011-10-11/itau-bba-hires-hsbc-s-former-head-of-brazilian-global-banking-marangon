Marcelo Marangon, the former head of
global banking in Brazil for  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , said he was
hired by Banco Itau BBA SA to handle the company’s newly created
unit serving large corporations.  Banco Itau BBA, the wholesale arm of  Itau Unibanco Holding
SA (ITUB4) , is segregating the 100 so-called ultra-large companies from
the 850 large ones, said Marangon, an executive director who
oversees six directors and 24 bankers at the Sao Paulo-based
lender.  “The idea is to give more attention to the large companies
and grow aggressively our credit and services to them,”
Marangon said today in a phone interview. Previously, the large
corporate area included all of Itau BBA’s 950 largest clients
and was headed by Nicolas Chacur, who left the bank.  Banco Itau BBA also hired Solange Vieira, the former
president of  Brazil ’s civil aviation agency, to head the
project-finance unit, she said.  “This was a division and now has the status of a
directory,” Vieira said in a phone interview from Rio de
Janeiro, adding that she plans to hire staff.  Vieira already has created four units: energy; logistical;
industry and mining; and oil and gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
