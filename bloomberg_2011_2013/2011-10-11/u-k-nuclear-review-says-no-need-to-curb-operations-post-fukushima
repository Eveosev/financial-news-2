The U.K.’s nuclear inspector
published its final assessment of the country’s reactors, seven
months after a Japanese earthquake and tsunami crippled the
Fukushima complex, raising questions about the safety of atomic
plants worldwide.  The  review  found no reason to curtail the operation of U.K.
operating sites, according to an e-mailed statement today. There
are no “fundamental weaknesses” in the U.K. nuclear licensing
system or the “safety assessment principles” that underpin it,
the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
