James Morsink, the head of the
International Monetary Fund’s mission to  Lithuania , said “it’s
possible but not my central scenario” that the Baltic country
can meet the euro adoption criteria next year to qualify for a
currency-switch in 2014.  Lithuania needs to cut its  budget deficit  and slow
inflation to qualify for the euro, Morsink said today at the
British Chamber of Commerce in Vilnius, Lithuania. The country’s
real exchange rate, which was overvalued before the economic
crisis in 2008, is now “in line with fundamentals,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
