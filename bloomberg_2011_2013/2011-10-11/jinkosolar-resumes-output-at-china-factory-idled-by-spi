JinkoSolar Holding Co., a Chinese
maker of solar panels, resumed production at a cell factory
after completing upgrades and reviewing policies following a
chemical spill that prompted protests by local villagers.  A temporary waste-storage unit at Jinko’s factory in
Haining,  China , released fluoride into a small water channel
after heavy rains, the Jiangxi-based company said today in a
statement.  The manufacturer of solar cells and modules said Sept. 19
that waste containing fluoride was swept from the plant into a
nearby river following the rains. Shares of the company fell the
most ever that day when the company suspended operations.  JinkoSolar’s American depositary receipts rose 6.1 percent
to $7.12 as of 10:08 a.m. in  New York . The shares have dropped
65 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
