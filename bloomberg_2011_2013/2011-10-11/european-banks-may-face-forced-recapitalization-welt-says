European governments are considering
setting banks a deadline for boosting their capital levels, the
German newspaper Die Welt  said , citing an unidentified person
involved in the negotiations.  Under the plan, governments would force banks to accept
public funds to increase their capital after the deadline has
expired, the newspaper said today. For a public-funding
guarantee to calm markets, European Union countries would have
to act jointly, the newspaper cited the person as saying.  While there is no agreement on the proposal at this time, a
decision may be taken within the next two weeks, the newspaper
cited unidentified people involved in the negotiations as
saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
