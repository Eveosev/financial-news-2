Top Glove Corp. plans to buy land in
 Cambodia , Malaysia and Indonesia to develop rubber plantations
to meet its own latex needs, it said in a statement today.  The company also expects demand for gloves to remain
“robust” in the longer term, it said. Its profit drop in the
fiscal fourth quarter was due to the higher latex cost and the
weaker dollar against the ringgit, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
