Norway’s relations with  China  are at
a “low point” after last year’s Nobel Peace Prize and need to
improve, Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told  Dagens
Naeringsliv .  While trade between the two countries has increased in
2011, a lack of political influence in China limits the support
that can be provided by Norwegian authorities to businesses,
Stoere told the Oslo-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
