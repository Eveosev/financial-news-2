Qatar Railways Co. delayed the first
tender to build a rail network across the Persian Gulf emirate
to the third quarter of next year, the company’s chief executive
officer said.  The company, which had planned to issue its first tender by
the end of this year, decided more detailed studies of the
project were needed, Saad Al-Mohannadi told reporters in the
Qatari capital Doha today.  The network linking stadiums around the country for the
2022 soccer  World Cup  is scheduled to be built over the next 10
years and will include a line connected to nearby Bahrain via a
yet-to-be-built bridge. The rail system will cost 130 billion
riyals ($38 billion) to construct, Geoff Mee, the company’s
deputy chief executive officer said June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
