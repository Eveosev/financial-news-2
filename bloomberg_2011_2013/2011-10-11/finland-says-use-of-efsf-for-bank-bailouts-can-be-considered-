Finland  still regards European bank
bailouts using the bloc’s rescue mechanism as a last resort,
Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen’s aide Matti Hirvola said.  The recapitalization of banks is primarily the task of
owners, then the bank’s home state bears the responsibility for
the institutions’ solvency and finally the use of the European
Financial Stability Facility “can be considered” as a last
instance, Hirvola said by phone today.  The comments follow a report on a Finnish government
website suggesting that Urpilainen wants Finland to reject
outright ever using the EFSF to rescue banks in the region. That
report was misleading, Hirvola said. The country this month
secured a collateral deal to appease bailout-weary voters,
though the deal was a watered-down version of a cash arrangement
sought in August.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
