Peru ’s benchmark overseas borrowing
costs fell the most in 17 months as optimism that European
leaders will stem the region’s debt crisis boosted demand for
emerging-market bonds.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
securities  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 22 basis points, or
0.22 percentage point, to 239, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.
That’s the steepest drop since a decline of 23 basis points in
May 2010.  “It’s an unwind of extreme pessimism,” said Siobhan Manning, head of Latin American strategy at RBS Securities Inc.
in Stamford, Connecticut. Investors have been shifting away from
more liquid securities such as U.S. Treasuries into higher-
yielding emerging-market assets “now that there has been a
build-up of diplomatic pressure for Europeans to come up with a
more consistent approach to their issues,” Manning said.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said Oct. 9 they will deliver a plan to
recapitalize European banks and address the Greek debt crisis by
the Nov. 3 Group of 20 summit.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7310 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7280 yesterday.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bonds due August 2020 fell two basis points to 5.78 percent,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Peru will expand a fiscal stimulus program that equals 0.5
percent of gross domestic product as the probability the world
will enter a recession has increased, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
