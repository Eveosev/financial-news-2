Bulgaria lowered its 2012 economic
growth forecast to 2.5 percent as expansion in western Europe is
slowing, Finance Minister  Simeon Djankov  said.  The revision was prompted by growth-estimate cuts in
Germany, Bulgaria’s biggest export destination, Djankov said in
an interview with BTV television station in Sofia today. The
 Finance Ministry  will have its 2012 budget draft ready to submit
to the Cabinet next week, he said.  “My preliminary estimates for next year’s growth are
around 2.5 percent,” Djankov said. “Our previous 2012 forecast
was for 4.2 percent. This is definitely not going to happen,
given what’s going on abroad.”  Bulgaria’s economic recovery slowed to the weakest in three
quarters from April through June, mirroring easing growth across
the European Union amid the euro area’s debt crisis. The EU buys
about 60 percent of  Bulgaria ’s exports. Second-quarter gross
domestic product growth slowed to 2 percent from 3.3 percent in
the previous three months, while seasonally adjusted GDP
advanced 0.3 percent in the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
