Yanbu National Petrochemicals Co. (YANSAB) , a
unit of  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , said third-quarter profit
more than doubled on higher volumes and petrochemical prices,
beating analysts’ estimates.  Net income rose to 827.94 million riyals ($220.6 million)
from 356.2 million riyals a year earlier, the Yanbu-based
company known as Yansab said in a  statement  to the  Saudi bourse 
today. The median estimate of five analysts was for 871 million
riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit rose because of “an increase in production and
sales quantities, combined with an improvement in sales prices
of most of the products,” Yansab said in the statement. Nine-
month earnings per share were 4.461 riyals, compared with 1.988
riyals a year earlier, the company said.  Saudi Arabian petrochemical makers are benefiting from
strong demand for fertilizers and petrochemicals from Asian
countries as oil traded about $90 a barrel in the third quarter.
Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co., also a unit of Saudi Basic
Industries, said on Oct. 9 that third-quarter profit doubled on
higher product prices.  Saudi petrochemical producers are likely to expand output
by 32 percent from a combined 53.2 million metric tons a year in
2009 to 70.2 million tons six years later, the  National
Commercial Bank  said in an e-mailed forecast last month. The
kingdom would account for 9.2 percent of global supply in 2015,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
