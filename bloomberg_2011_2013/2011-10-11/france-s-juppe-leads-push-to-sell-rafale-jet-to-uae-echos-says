French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe 
is leading negotiations to sell 60 Rafale fighter jets to the
United Arab Emirates, les Echos reported, without citing anyone.  Juppe was named to head the effort after a September 27
meeting in Paris between President Nicolas Sarkozy and Abu Dhabi
Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the newspaper said.
 France  is trying to secure its first sale of the Rafale, made by
Dassault Aviation.  A deal with the UAE may be announced as early as the Dubai
air show in mid-November, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
