The Slovak government will tie
todayâ€™s vote on the expanded euro bailout fund to a no-
confidence vote after a junior coalition member rejected a
compromise to allow the measure to pass, said Prime Minister
 Iveta Radicova .  She told reporters that the vote on the European Financial
Stability Facility will be repeated should it be rejected today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
