Latvia’s 2011 budget deficit will be
below the goal of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product, said
Mark Griffiths, the  International Monetary Fund ’s mission chief
for the Baltic country.  “The good news is both sides expect the number to be below
the program target for this year,” Griffiths told journalists
in Riga today.  Latvia’s economy grew 5.6 percent in the second quarter,
the most in 3 1/2 years, after contracting by almost a quarter
since 2008 following the end of a credit-fueled real-estate
bubble. The government was forced to turn to a group led by the
European Union and the IMF for a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.2
billion) loan in 2008 after the second-biggest Latvian bank
needed a state rescue.  “We do think it’s very important for the government to aim
at a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP next year and to meet the
Maastricht criteria,” Griffiths said, referring to rules that
determine whether a country is able to adopt the euro. “We need
to meet this in a strong and sustainable way, not through odd
measures, but through genuine, lasting measures.”  Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis’s Unity Party, the
Zatlers’ Reform Party and the  National Alliance  agreed late
yesterday to form a three-party government with 56 seats in the
100-member parliament that favors further austerity and adoption
of the euro in 2014. Latvia plans to complete its lending
program this year, and the final review mission will take place
at the end of this month, according to the  Finance Ministry .  The IMF has a “number of serious concerns” about the
government’s decision to invest 57.6 million lati ($110.8
million) in AirBaltic AS, Griffiths said. The state owns 52.6
percent of the unprofitable airline while Baltic Aviation
Systems has 47.2 percent.  “We need to make sure that public money is not wasted,”
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
