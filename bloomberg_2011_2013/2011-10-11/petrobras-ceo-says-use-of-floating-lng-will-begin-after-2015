Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, delayed plans to use floating
natural-gas plants supplied by  Saipem SpA (SPM) ,  Technip SA (TEC)  and  SBM
Offshore NV (SBMO)  until after 2015, said its chief executive officer.  Petrobras has chosen to use pipelines to transport gas from
fields in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean to maximize the
fuel’s value, CEO Jose Sergio Gabrielli told journalists today
in London. A new pipeline will be online before the end of 2014
and Petrobras may use the floating plants after 2015 to help
develop the largest oil discoveries in the Western Hemisphere in
more than 30 years, he said.  Gabrielli said two bids were “attractive,” without naming
the companies. The plants, which cost more than $3 billion,
convert the gas into a liquid for transportation by ships.  Petrobras had been reviewing bids from  France ’s Technip,
SBM Offshore of the Netherlands and Italy’s Saipem to build
floating natural-gas units.  Petrobras rose 0.2 percent to 18.95 reais at 2:43 p.m. in
Sao Paulo trading. The stock has fallen 31 percent this year,
more than the 23 percent decline in Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa
index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
