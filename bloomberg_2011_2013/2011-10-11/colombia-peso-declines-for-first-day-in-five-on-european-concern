Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields higher for the first day in six, amid concern European
officials may fail to halt the region’s sovereign-debt crisis
before it spreads to banks.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
7.49 percent. The bond’s price fell 0.233 centavo to 120.185
centavos per peso.  European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet warned
of threats to the financial system as the conflict among
political leaders intensified over how to extricate Europe from
the debt crisis. Trichet’s message came before Slovakian
lawmakers voted on the euro region’s retooled bailout fund.
While Slovakia’s largest opposition party rejected the measure
in a first vote today, Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said the
revamped fund will likely be passed in a separate vote later
this week.  “Everyone’s focused on what may come out of  Europe ,” said
Francisco Chaves, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage
Corredores Asociados SA. “Just as we had gains in the market
yesterday, today we see some corrections amid concern on how
this continues to evolve.”  The peso rose 1.2 percent to 1,914.75 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,936.90 yesterday. It has dropped 6.1 percent in the last
month, the worst performance after the Chilean peso among the
six most traded currencies in  Latin America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
