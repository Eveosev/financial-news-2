Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, may report a slowdown in its earnings
recovery after the lightweight metal used in beverage cans and
aircraft erased all this year’s price gains.  Third-quarter net income will be 22 cents a share, compared
with 9 cents a year earlier, according the average of 15
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s 21 percent
less than analysts estimated a month ago.  “Aluminum was just starting to have its day in the sun in
the first and second quarters,”  Jorge Beristain , a Greenwich,
Connecticut-based mining analyst at Deutsche Bank AG who has a
“hold” rating on the shares, said in an interview. “Now the
stool has been pulled out from the aluminum price. That creates
a very tough headwind.”  The price drop is undermining efforts by Chief Executive
Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  to boost earnings at Alcoa. The New
York-based company cut thousands of jobs and closed smelters
since the plunge in commodities during the financial crisis in
2008 led to three successive quarterly losses.  Alcoa, the first company in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  to issue earnings, will report after regular trading on
North American markets closes today. Alcoa rose 2.1 percent to
$10.30 at 11:04 a.m. in New York. The shares have dropped 33
percent in 2011, the worst performer on the Dow Jones after Bank
of America Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.  Mike Belwood, an Alcoa spokesman, declined to comment
before the earnings were released.  Growth Doubts  Citigroup Inc. cut its estimate for Alcoa’s earnings to 19
cents a share from 23 cents in a note dated yesterday, citing
lower aluminum prices and higher costs for raw materials such as
caustic soda.  Alcoa’s smelters would likely post a loss in the fourth
quarter if spot aluminum prices averaged 99 cents a pound
($2,182.55 a metric ton) for the full quarter, Brian Yu and
Jonathan Sullivan, analysts at Citigroup, wrote in the note.  Aluminum for immediate delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell 15 percent in the third quarter. It fell 1.7
percent to $2,185 at 11:01 a.m. New York time, down 11 percent
for this year. The metal traded at $2,772 a metric ton on April
28, its highest since Aug. 21, 2008.  The European debt crisis and doubts about global economic
growth have reduced aluminum demand growth and suppressed
prices, Lloyd O’Carroll, an analyst at Davenport & Co. in
Richmond,  Virginia , said in a Sept. 21 note.  Commodities Plunge  O’Carroll, who has a “buy” recommendation on Alcoa, cut
his 2011 growth prediction for U.S. aluminum shipments to 9.5
percent, or 20.7 billion pounds, from 10.5 percent previously.  Alcoa’s earnings were 66 cents in the second quarter of
2008, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and
the financial crisis sent commodity prices tumbling. They
haven’t exceeded 32 cents since. The company posted three
consecutive quarters of losses through June 30, 2009. It has cut
20,080 jobs since June, 2008, according to Bloomberg data. In
2010, it permanently shut 295,000 tons of capacity at smelters
in  Maryland ,  North Carolina  and  Indiana .  Earnings of 23 cents would compare with 31 cents in the
three months through June. That would be the first quarter-on-
quarter drop in Alcoa’s earnings in a year. Third-quarter sales
gained 18 percent to $6.24 billion, according to the average of
nine analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Rusal Drops  “The decline in aluminum prices should be the largest
negative for earnings sequentially,” O’Carroll said.  Rival aluminum producers are also feeling the pressure.
Russia’s United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest, said Oct. 5 it
will reduce production at its higher-cost smelters. Rusal has
fallen 43 percent this year. Norway’s  Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY) ,  Europe ’s
third-largest producer, said in July it would cut jobs and
capacity this year because of lower construction demand.  Alcoa, which has operations in 31 countries, produced 3.59
million tons of aluminum and sold it at an average price of
$2,356 a ton in 2010, according to filings.  The company is a fully integrated aluminum producer. It
mines bauxite, an ore that contains aluminum, and refines it
into alumina, the raw material used by aluminum smelters. As
well as selling aluminum to industrial users, Alcoa also makes
products such as can sheet and components for cars and aircraft.  Earnings will rise should commodity prices recover. Alcoa
is “very levered” to the aluminum price, Beristain said. The
metal will average $2,550 a ton next year, according to the mean
of 15 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The metal
averaged $2,173 last year and $2,488 so far this year.  Aluminum demand may continue rising, driven by  China , the
biggest consumer of the metal. Global use will increase 12
percent this year, Kleinfeld said in July. Aerospace demand will
climb 7 percent this year, automotive will gain 4 percent to 8
percent, and commercial construction will rise 1 percent to 3
percent, Alcoa said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
