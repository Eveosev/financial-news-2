Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM) , the fifth-
largest Canadian gold producer by market capitalization,
increased production by about 11 percent in the third quarter,
helped by better performances at mines in  Finland  and the
Canadian arctic.  Agnico-Eagle, based in Toronto, produced 265,978 ounces in
the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with 239,328 ounces in
the second quarter, it said in a statement.  “The higher level of production is largely due to improved
performance at Kittila and Meadowbank,” the company said.
“Further improvements in gold production and operating
performance are anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2011.”  Agnico-Eagle will spend C$25 million ($24.3 million) this
year, up from an initially budgeted C$20 million, to tackle
water-inflow and ground-subsidence problems at its Goldex mine
in  Quebec , the company said.  Water flowing into the mine lowered the water table and may
have affected the integrity of the rocks. The mine and
processing facilities are operating normally, Agnico-Eagle said.  The company expects to spend another C$20 million in 2012
on monitoring and remediation of the problem and will reassess
the situation every three months.  The issues at Goldex “appear to be potentially more
serious than initially assumed,” David Haughton, a Toronto-
based analyst at Bank of Montreal, wrote in a note to clients.  Agnico-Eagle rose 2.6 percent to C$60.74 in Toronto. The
shares have fallen 21 percent this year.  The four largest Canadian gold producers by market value
are Barrick Gold Corp., Goldcorp Inc., Kinross Gold Corp. and
Yamana Gold Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
