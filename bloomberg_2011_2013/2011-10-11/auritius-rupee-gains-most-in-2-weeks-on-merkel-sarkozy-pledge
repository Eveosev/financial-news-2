Mauritius’s rupee appreciated the
most in more than two weeks against the dollar after  Europe 
pledged to support the biggest banks, increasing demand for
high-yielding emerging- and frontier-market assets.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s currency advanced as much
as 1 percent to 28.95 per dollar, the most since Sept. 28, and
traded 0.7 percent higher at 29.05 by 12:07 p.m. in Port Louis,
the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close at
this level would be its highest since Oct. 3. Versus the euro,
the currency of its main trading partner, the rupee appreciated
1.1 percent to 39.5283.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
Nicholas Sarkozy on Oct. 9 set an end-of-month deadline to
deliver a plan to recapitalize Europe’s banks and address
 Greece ’s debt crisis. France and  Belgium  agreed to break up
Dexia SA, with the Belgian federal government paying 4 billion
euros ($5.5 billion) for the consumer-lending unit.  “The European Union leaders have been able to buy two more
weeks from the markets to set their house in order,” analysts
at  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the country’s largest lender by
market value, said in an e-mailed note to clients today. “It is
hoped that the outcome will live up to expectations.”  Mauritius, an open economy with a population of 1.3 million
people, is a net buyer of food and fuels, with 67 percent of
import bills denominated in dollars. Europe is the country’s
main source of tourist arrivals and largest buyer of
manufactured goods, according to  Statistics Mauritius .  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 28.101 to 28.2681
and the selling prices declined to 29.6091 compared with 29.7097
yesterday, according to  exchange rates  published today on the
Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
