Taiwan’s dollar rose the most since
April and  government bonds  fell, pushing the five-year yield to
a two-month high, as a pledge by European leaders to tackle
their debt crisis helped shore up demand for riskier assets.  Benchmark stock indexes rallied across  Asia  today after
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President Nicholas
Sarkozy pledged at the weekend to deliver a plan to recapitalize
European banks and address  Greece ’s sovereign-debt crisis by Nov.
3. The island’s exports rose 9.9 percent in September from a
year earlier, following a 7.2 percent increase in August, the
government reported on Oct. 7. Local financial markets were
closed yesterday for the National Day holiday.  “Sentiment was hugely boosted today following the
consensus reached by German and French leaders,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.
“It seems investors are slightly more optimistic about the
global economy.”  Taiwan ’s dollar appreciated 0.5 percent to close at
NT$30.348 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It touched NT$30.29, the strongest level since Sept.
22.  The yield on the government’s 2 percent bonds due July 2016
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.05 percent,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show. That’s the highest
rate for benchmark five-year debt since Aug. 17.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.394 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
