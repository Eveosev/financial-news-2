Tanzania’s shilling weakened against
the dollar amid increased demand for the U.S. currency from oil
importers and manufacturers.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy fell
0.1 percent to 1,702.50 per dollar by 2:56 p.m. in  Dar es
Salaam , the commercial capital. It closed at 1,700.50 yesterday.  “We saw some customers particularly oil importers and
manufactures demand dollars later in the day,” Eric Chijoriga, a
trader at National Bank of Commerce Ltd., said by phone from the
city. “Generally the market has been quiet today with few trade
deals.”  The Tanzanian shilling has weakened 13 percent against the
dollar so far this year as inflation surged to a 15-month high
of 14.1 percent in August on rising food and energy costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
