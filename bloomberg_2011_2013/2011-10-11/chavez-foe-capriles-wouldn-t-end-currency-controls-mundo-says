Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez
likely opponent in next year’s elections said he wouldn’t
dismantle currency controls if he came into power,  El Mundo 
reported.  Henrique Capriles Radonski, the current governor of Miranda
state and frontrunner to win an opposition primary to choose a
candidate, said he wouldn’t end the system of a fixed rate for
the bolivar against the dollar if he couldn’t guarantee the
 exchange rate  wouldn’t jump, according to the Caracas-based
daily.  The issue of companies that have been expropriated by
Chavez’s government would have to be addressed on a case-by-case
basis, El Mundo quoted Capriles as saying. Inflation would be
tackled by increasing the supply of goods, Capriles said,
according to El Mundo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
