Richard Gere ’s vintage guitar and
amplifier collection brought in $936,438 at Christie’s in New
York today.  The top lot was a 1960 Gibson Les Paul that fetched
$98,500, surpassing its presale high estimate of $90,000. The
winning bid came by telephone. The room was full of quiet guitar
aficionados, including musician  Steve Miller  and redhead model,
singer and songwriter Karen Elson.  “You are being too quiet,” said auctioneer Andrew
McVinish. “If you want to rock ‘n’ roll -- rock ‘n’ roll.”  The 107-lot group, amassed by the “Pretty Woman” male
star since he was a kid, was expected to realize about $1
million. Only 4 percent of the lots failed to find buyers.  “Without ever thinking I was putting a collection
together, there seems to be one,” Gere said in his catalog
statement. “I just bought what I liked, what sounded good --
what played well.”  An active philanthropist for  Tibet  and HIV-AIDS education,
Gere has said the proceeds will go to causes he supports.  Other notable guitars in the sale included a 1931 Martin D-
28 that fetched $62,500, in the middle of its presale range of
$50,000 to $70,000.  A 1934 archtop made by John D’Angelico and later owned and
played by James D’Aquisto, two of the premier New York luthiers,
sold for $20,000, above its top estimate of $15,000.  A 1958 Gibson Flying V sold for $74,500, also within its
estimate range of $60,000 to $90,000.  After placing the winning $9,500 bid ($11,875 with the
buyer’s premium) on a Gibson ES-335TD with Sunburst finish,
Scott Forman hollered: “Yes!”  B.B. King  “It’s gorgeous and the sound is amazing,” said the  New
York  ophthalmologist. “B.B. King plays a guitar he calls
‘Lucille.’ It’s the same model.”  What attracted him to the sale was the quality of guitars
not the provenance.  “It’s not about Richard Gere. It’s about the instrument,”
Forman said. The sale prices include the buyer’s commission; the
estimates don’t.  Miller, who sat in the back of the room wearing sunglasses,
kept his paddle idle. His appearance at Christie’s was being
filmed for a documentary titled “Burst: In Search of a Perfect
Guitar,” about his quest to find a pristine 1959 Les Paul
Standard Sunburst.  “I wasn’t tempted by anything,” he said. “I have 450
guitars.”  Gere, who won a Golden Globe for his performance in the
movie version of “ Chicago ,” studied trumpet as a child and is
a self-taught guitarist and pianist.  A March auction of  Eric Clapton ’s guitars, amplifiers and
other memorabilia at Bonhams in New York raised $2.2 million for
the musician’s  Crossroads Centre Antigua , for drug and alcohol
rehabilitation, almost four times its presale total of $400,000
to $600,000. The priciest item was a 1948 Gibson L-5P guitar
that fetched $82,960.  To contact the reporter of this story:
