Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.,
the world’s largest crop-nutrient maker by market value, led
fertilizer stocks higher after Credit Suisse Group AG increased
its estimates for nutrient prices on “robust” grain demand.  Potash Corp. climbed 6.5 percent to C$49.44 in Toronto,
while Plymouth, Minnesota-based  Mosaic Co. (MOS) , the world’s largest
maker of phosphate fertilizer, rose 4.3 percent to $55.77 in  New
York .  “The outlook for grain prices looks robust,” London-based
analyst Lars Kjellberg said today in a note to clients.  Kjellberg expects the price of granular potash, a form of
potassium, in the U.S. Midwest to rise to $557 per short ton
this year, up from a previous estimate of $546, according to the
note. Diammonium phosphate on the U.S. Gulf Coast will rise to
$631 a metric ton, more than the previous estimate of $603.  Kjellberg expects higher fertilizer prices to lift
industry-wide net profit by 3 percent this year, 17 percent next
year and 23 percent in 2013, buoyed by robust grain prices and
tight supplies of crop nutrients.  The price of urea, a nitrogen-based fertilizer, in the U.S.
cornbelt will rise to $475 a ton this year, up from a previous
estimate of $462.  “On the back of the recent market sell off, valuations for
the fertilizer sector look highly compelling,” Kjellberg said
in the note. “We recommend investors take advantage of the sell
off to build a position in the sector.”  Potash Corp. is based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
