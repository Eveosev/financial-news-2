OpenLink Financial Inc., a provider
of financial software, set the initial  interest rate  on $375
million of loans it’s seeking to support Hellman & Friedman
LLC’s acquisition of the company from  Carlyle Group , according
to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  A $325 million term loan will pay 6.5 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.
Libor, a rate banks charge to lend to each other, will have a
1.5 percent floor.  Lenders are offered a one-year soft-call protection of 101
cents, said the person. That means OpenLink would have to pay 1
cent more than face value to refinance the debt during the first
year.  The Uniondale, New York-based company is also seeking a $50
million revolving line of credit that will pay 6.5 percentage
points more than Libor. The lending benchmark will have a 1.5
percent minimum.  OpenLink is proposing to sell the  term loan  and revolver at
96 cents to 97 cents on the dollar, the person said, reducing
proceeds for the company and increasing the yield for investors.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the deal and lenders
must submit commitments by Oct. 25 in  New York .  Judith Peterson, a spokeswoman for OpenLink, didn’t respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
