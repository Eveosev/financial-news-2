Daily exports of North Sea Troll
crude oil for November will increase by 17 percent from this
month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The schedule comprises 12 cargoes of 600,000 barrels, one 1
million-barrel shipment and one 300,000-barrel. That amounts to
8.5 million barrels, or 283,333 barrels a day, compared with
241,935 barrels a day this month, according to the plan.  Exports of Aasgard will increase to nine 855,000-barrel
cargoes in November, one more than this month, according to a
separate program. That will total 7.695 million barrels, or
256,500 barrels a day, compared with 220,645 barrels a day in
October.  Statoil ASA,  Norway â€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the two fields.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
