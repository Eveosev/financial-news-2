Bank of England  policy maker  Adam
Posen  said economies will benefit more if global authorities
take a “double barreled” approach to policy in addition to
central banks easing monetary policy.   “You can do better by trying to address credit problems
directly in addition to what you do with old-fashioned
quantitative easing,” Posen said in a Bloomberg News interview
in New York today. While QE can have a positive impact, “that
doesn’t mean that’s the only thing you can do.”  “In the U.K., we’re doing more QE and hoping to do more in
terms of small business lending,” he said. “In the U.S., you
want a double barrelled punch -- you want more QE and you want
some structural addressing of the real-estate problems.”  He also said the world is going “into a situation where
inflation is going to be lower than it should be and where
growth is lower than it should be.”  That means “you can have
more growth without causing runaway inflation and that’s why you
want to act.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
