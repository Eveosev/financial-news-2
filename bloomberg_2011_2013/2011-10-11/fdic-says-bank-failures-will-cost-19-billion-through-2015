U.S.  bank failures  through 2015 will
drain $19 billion from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. fund
for covering losses from shutdowns, the agency said in an update
of its reserve ratio projections.  The $19 billion figure reported by the FDIC today is a
decrease from the estimated $23 billion needed to cover bank
failures in 2010, reflecting both the slowing rate of bank
shutdowns and the impact of assessment increases imposed by the
FDIC to bolster the Deposit Insurance Fund.  The fund, pushed into deficit by the wave of failures
stemming from the 2008 credit crisis, turned positive as of June
30 after seven consecutive quarters of negative balances.  “The assessment that the insurance fund remains on the
path to recovery and on track to meet the goals established by
Congress is welcome news,” FDIC Acting Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg said in a statement. “As we seek to stay on track,
it’s important to always be mindful of the challenges we face
and ongoing risks to the insurance fund.”  Under current projections, FDIC assessment rates will boost
the insurance fund to 1.15 percent of insured deposits in 2018,
according to the agency’s statement. The regulator is required
by the Dodd-Frank Act to increase the ratio to 1.35 percent by
Sept. 30, 2020.  Today’s report shows that the FDIC may have gone farther
than it needed to in increasing assessments, according to  James Chessen , chief economist for the  American Bankers Association .  “The FDIC had set aside $17.7 billion for possible bank
failures losses at the start of 2011, twice what the actual
losses are likely to be this year,” Chessen said in a
statement. “Banks are paying $13.5 billion in yearly premiums
to the FDIC, which is far in excess of the yearly costs expected
by the FDIC over the next several years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
