Serbia’s inflation rate probably
fell below 10 percent in September and will decrease further
through the rest of the year, the Belgrade-based  Economics
Institute  said.  The rate probably dropped to 9.4 percent in September from
10.5 percent August, said Vladimir Vuckovic, head of the
Institute’s research team. It may then fall to 9.1 percent in
October and 8.9 percent in November on weak aggregate demand and
stabilized food prices, he said. The rate stood at 14.7 percent
in April.  “We’re in a kind of recessionary environment and that
works against price increases,” Vuckovic said, presenting the
Institute’s monthly report on  macroeconomic analysis and trends .
Serbia’s Statistics Office will issue the official data on
September inflation tomorrow.  January-November industrial output is seen growing 2.8
percent against the same period a year earlier, while the
eleven-month retail trade in constant prices may contract 14.9
percent, according to the Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
