Most U.K. stocks fell, halting the
biggest four-day advance for the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  since November
2008, amid uncertainty that Slovakia will ratify the expansion
of the euro area’s bailout fund.  Mining companies led the drop, paced by Eurasian Natural
Resources Corp. and  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , as base metal prices
tumbled in  London . BG Group Plc retreated as  China  extended a
value-based tax on sales of oil and natural gas and crude oil
fell. Bank shares limited declines.  The benchmark FTSE 100 slid 3.3, or 0.1 percent, to 5,395.7
at the close in London as three stocks fell for every two that
rose. The FTSE All-Share Index was little changed while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index declined 1.3 percent in Dublin.  The rally “has stalled after some hesitation on  Slovakia ’s
part about approving an extension” of the bailout fund, said
Christopher Purdy, trader at Spreadex Ltd. in St. Alban’s,
 England . “This hesitation casts further doubt over how long a
set of states with vastly differing opinions can operate in
concert.”  The FTSE 100 had surged 9.2 percent over the previous four
days as German and French leaders pledged to create a plan in
three weeks to recapitalize banks in  Europe . A planned
reinforcement of the European Financial Stability Facility, the
bailout fund known as the EFSF, faced a vote today in Slovakia’s
parliament. Slovakia is the only country that hasn’t ratified
the fund.  Miners Fall  Antofagasta slid 1.6 percent to 1,077 pence, falling for
the first time in five days. ENRC lost 2.3 percent to 625 pence
and Anglo American Plc slid 1.1 percent to 2,391 pence.  Copper led base metals lower as Chinese export growth waned
in September. Copper for delivery in three months fell as much
as 4.5 percent to $7,159.75 a metric ton. Aluminum, zinc, tin,
nickel and lead also declined.  Cairn Energy Plc declined 1.4 percent to 293.7 pence as
crude oil fell from its highest level in more than two weeks in
 New York . Tullow Oil Plc slid 0.8 percent to 1,397 pence.  BG Group slipped 0.6 percent to 1,307.5 pence. China said
it will extend a value-based tax on sales of oil and natural gas
starting next month to help save energy in the world’s fastest-
growing major economy.  Banks limited losses on the FTSE 100 today, led by Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc which gained 2.8 percent to 25.30
pence. Barclays Plc rose 2.1 percent to 175.7 pence and Lloyds
Banking Group Plc increased 1.6 percent to 36.28 pence.  Rockhopper’s Finds  Elsewhere,  Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH)  surged 13 percent to
191.25 pence. Its shares saw a volume 2 1/2 times the average in
the last three months. The company, which explores for oil to
the north of the Falkland Islands, raised its estimate of oil
resources at the Sea Lion field. It said the field may hold 844
million to 1.4 billion barrels of oil. In August, the company
estimated resources in the range of 608 million to 1.3 billion
barrels.  Mothercare Plc surged 9.2 percent to 210.2 pence after the
children’s clothing retailer said Chief Executive Officer Ben Gordon will step down. The company last week warned that trading
was “well below” forecasts.  CSR Plc (CSR)  dropped 5.8 percent to 183.4 pence after Citigroup
Inc. downgraded the U.K. semiconductor maker to “sell” from
“neutral,” citing “very strong competition” in digital
television from  Taiwan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
