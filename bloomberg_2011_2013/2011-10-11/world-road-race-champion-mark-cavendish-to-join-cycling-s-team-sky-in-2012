Mark Cavendish , who last month
became the first Briton to win cycling’s World Road Race title
in 46 years, will join Team Sky in 2012.  The 26-year-old sprint specialist, known as the Manx
Missile, is changing teams as HTC-Highroad is being disbanded
because it cannot find long-term sponsorship.  “Mark is the greatest sprinter of his generation and is
well on his way to becoming the greatest of all time,” Team
Sky’s Principal Dave Brailsford said in a  statement . “He is a
rider of exceptional talent who has proved his pedigree at the
very highest level of our sport.”  Cavendish won the green jersey for topping the points
competition at this year’s Tour de  France , claiming five stage
victories including on the final day as the race concluded with
the traditional ride along the Champs-Elysees in Paris.  He has a total of 20 stage wins in cycling’s premier event
and a further 10 in Grand Tour events the Giro d’Italia and
Vuelta a Espana.  Cavendish was led through by current Team Sky members Ian
Stannard and Geraint Thomas in the final stages of the Sept. 25
World Road Race event. World time trial silver medal winner
Bradley Wiggins is also on the Team Sky roster.  “Mark’s signing is another statement of our intent for
next year and beyond,” Wiggins said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
