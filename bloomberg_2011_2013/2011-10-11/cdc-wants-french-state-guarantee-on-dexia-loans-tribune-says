France ’s state-owned Caisse des
Depots et Consignations is seeking a state guarantee on  Dexia SA (DEXB) 
loans that it’s being asked to take over in order to protect its
AAA credit rating, La Tribune reported, without citing anyone.  The newspaper cited unidentified people close to CDC as
saying that it’s being asked to assume loans worth between 20
billion euros and 40 billion euros from Dexia’s French municipal
lending unit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
