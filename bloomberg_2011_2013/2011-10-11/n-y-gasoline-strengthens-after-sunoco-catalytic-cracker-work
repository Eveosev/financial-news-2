Gasoline gained in New York after
 Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  started work on a fluid catalytic cracker at the
Marcus Hook refinery in Pennsylvania.  Work on the gasoline-making unit is expected to take about
four days and resulted in minor emissions today, according to
Kevin Sunday, a spokesman for the  Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection .  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 0.88 cent to 13.88 cents a gallon at 2:18 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained
6.23 cents to $2.8876 a gallon.  Sunoco shut part of the unit for the maintenance, said
Kevin Sunday, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.  Thomas Golembeski, a Sunoco spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. The plant has a capacity
of 194,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The premium for the same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  shrank 2.25
cents to 2.5 cents a gallon.  Chalmette Refining LLC’s plant in Chalmette, Louisiana, is
operating normally after a unit outage late yesterday, according
to a company spokesman.  There was no impact on production from the incident, said
Will Hinson, the spokesman. “Operations in this unit were
restored several hours later,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
