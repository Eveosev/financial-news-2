The euro approached a three-week
high versus the dollar before European Commission President  Jose Barroso  presents proposals on bank recapitalization after
Germany and  France  pledged to draw up a plan by early November.  The shared currency was 0.3 percent from the highest since
Sept. 21 against the yen as European Union and International
Monetary Fund officials indicated  Greece  will get an 8 billion-
euro ($10.9 billion) loan next month, saying the nation has made
“important progress.”  South Korea ’s won fell from a two-week
high after a government report showed foreign direct investment
in the country fell last quarter.  “The market is definitely putting its faith in the ability
of the euro-area authorities to have something concrete in place
by the end of the month and that is helping support euro,” said
Emma Lawson, a currency strategist at National Australia Bank
Ltd. in Sydney.  The euro traded at $1.3651 at 8:19 a.m. London time from
$1.3640 yesterday, after rising to $1.3699 on Oct. 10, the
strongest level since Sept. 21. The currency was at 104.69 yen
from 104.55 yen, after reaching 104.99 yen on Oct. 10. The
dollar bought 76.68 yen from 76.65 yen.  Barroso said yesterday he hoped the European Commission’s
proposals would be an “important contribution for the European
Council and the euro-area summit on Oct. 23.”  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the
government will meet commitments to international creditors to
deepen pension and wage cuts, promising parliamentary approval
for the draft 2012 budget, which was passed at the finance
committee level yesterday.  Slovakia Vote  Gains in the euro were tempered as Slovakia’s opposition
leader said lawmakers must find a way to approve  Europe ’s
enhanced bailout fund, which was rejected yesterday amid a
dispute over the future of Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova .
Slovakia is the only euro-area country yet to approve the plan.  The won snapped a three-day gain versus the dollar as the
Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said foreign direct investment in
the country dropped 24.6 percent from a year earlier to $2.21
billion, the first decline in a year.  “The markets are swinging back and forth in tandem with
progress or setbacks in Europe’s plans to stem the crisis,”
said Park Joo Hyung, a Seoul-based currency dealer at Korea
Exchange Bank. “The Slovakia rejection threw cold water on
sentiment again. This, together with importers’ dollar demand,
is driving the won lower.”  The won weakened 0.2 percent to close at 1,166.85 per
dollar after advancing to 1,160.80 yesterday, the strongest
since Sept. 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
