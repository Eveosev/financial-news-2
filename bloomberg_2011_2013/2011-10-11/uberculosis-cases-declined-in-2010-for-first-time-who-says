The number of people who fell ill
with tuberculosis dropped from 2005 to 2010, the  World Health
Organization  said  today  in its first report to show a decline in
cases of the world’s second-deadliest infectious killer.  New cases of the bacterial infection dropped to 8.8 million
in 2010 from a peak of 9 million in 2005, the Geneva-based
agency said in an e-mailed statement. Deaths from TB dropped to
1.4 million from 1.8 million in 2003, according to the agency.  “This is cause for celebration,” United Nations
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said in the statement. “But it is
no cause for complacency. Too many millions still develop TB
each year, and too many die.”  A $1 billion shortfall in 2012 funding for fighting the
disease threatens to undo progress as drug-resistant forms
spread, the WHO said. Only about 16 percent of patients with
multidrug-resistant TB were reported to have received treatment
last year, according to the report.  AIDS is the world’s biggest infectious killer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
