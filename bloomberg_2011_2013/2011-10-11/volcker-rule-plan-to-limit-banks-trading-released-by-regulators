U.S. regulators are seeking comment
on proposed rules that would bar deposit-taking banks from
engaging in proprietary trading for their own accounts and from
owning or sponsoring  hedge funds  or private-equity funds.  The so-called Volcker rule, a Dodd-Frank Act provision
named for former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker , was
released today as a joint proposal by the Fed, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
agencies will take comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking
through Jan. 13, according to the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
