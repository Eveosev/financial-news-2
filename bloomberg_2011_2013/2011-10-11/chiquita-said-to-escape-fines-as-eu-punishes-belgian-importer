Leon Van Parys NV, a banana
importer, may be fined as soon as tomorrow for fixing prices
with  Chiquita Brands International Inc. (CQB) , which will escape a
penalty, according to two people with knowledge of the case.  Chiquita, the world’s biggest banana producer, won’t be
punished because it was first to cooperate with regulators, said
the people who can’t be identified because the decision isn’t
public. No other companies are involved in the cartel, they
said.  Chiquita, based in Cincinnati, avoided EU fines for blowing
the whistle in a similar case in 2008. Dole Food Co. and Fresh
Del Monte Produce Inc. were fined about 60 million euros ($82
million) for fixing the price of bananas with Chiquita. The two
companies rejected claims that they shared commercially
sensitive information, arguing that they were required to
exchange trade data under the EU’s system of setting import
volumes and duties.  Leon Van Parys, based in Antwerp,  Belgium , didn’t respond
to a phone call outside regular office hours. The company
imports bananas to  Europe  using the brand name Bonita.  Ed Loyd, a spokesman for Chiquita didn’t immediately
respond to a phone and an e-mail message seeking comment. The EU
declined to comment.  Cartels are “the top priority” for the EU’s antitrust
authority because they harm consumers and companies, EU
Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  has said. The
regulator  levied  3 billion euros in fines on 70 companies for
price-fixing last year, according to the antitrust chief.  To contact the reporter on this story:
