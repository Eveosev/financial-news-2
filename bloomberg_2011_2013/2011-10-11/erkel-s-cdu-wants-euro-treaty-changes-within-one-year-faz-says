German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Christian Democrats aim to change the European treaties within
one year,  Frankfurter Allgemeine  reported, citing an interview
with Hermann Groehe, the party’s general secretary.  The euro region member states should implement a German-
style debt brake, while violations of the European Stability and
Growth Pact should be punished through the European Court of
Justice, Groehe was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
