Hyundai Oilbank Co.,  South Korea ’s
fourth-biggest refiner, began construction of a site to store
oil and petrochemical products as part of its plan to become a
regional fuel distributor.  Construction of the storage facility at Ulsan harbor,
southeast of Seoul, will cost 100 billion won ($86 million),
Seoul-based Hyundai said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  The company plans to store oil from domestic suppliers and
handle cargoes in transit from Japan and  Singapore , Chief
Executive Officer Kwon Oh Gap said in the statement. The Ulsan
facility, which will include a 300,000-kiloliter tank, may be
completed in the second half of 2013, according to the statement.  Hyundai will be the first domestic refiner moving into
commercial oil-storage as South Korean oil-processing plants
diversify their businesses. The company is owned by Hyundai
Heavy Industries Co., the world’s biggest shipbuilder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
