CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s largest
utility, will focus on building two new reactors at the Temelin
nuclear plant, upgrading domestic power stations and building
wind farms in Poland, Romania and  Germany .  Extending the 2,000-megawatt Temelin site will be the
company’s “absolute priority” this decade, Chief Executive
Officer Daniel Benes said today at a press conference in Prague.  CEZ’s focus shifted from foreign acquisitions to the
domestic market last year. The utility will now be
“consolidating its operations in Bulgaria, Albania, Romania and
other eastern European markets while investing only into
renewable resources like wind farms and hydropower stations
abroad,” Benes said.  CEZ expects to have 3,000 megawatts installed in renewable
resources outside of the  Czech Republic  by 2016, Benes said.
“Profit from foreign renewable energy sources will serve to
finance the construction of new reactors at Temelin,” he said.  The foreign unit’s earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization will exceed 10 billion koruna
($549 million) this year, division director Tomas Pleskac said
at the conference. The company expects a similar result next
year.  The 2010 dividend from CEZ’s foreign operations will be
about 10 million koruna, Pleskac said. The company is still
considering leaving  Turkey , he said.  CEZ shares erased an earlier gain of as much as 1.3 percent
and were down 0.1 percent to 711 koruna at 12:34 p.m. in Prague.  To contact the reporters on this story:
