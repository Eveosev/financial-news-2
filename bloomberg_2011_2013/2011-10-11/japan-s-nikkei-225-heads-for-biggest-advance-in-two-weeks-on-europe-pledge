Japanese stocks rose for a third day,
with the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average headed for its biggest gain in
two weeks, after German and French leaders pledged to support
European banks and stem the region’s debt crisis.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-
largest publicly traded lender, climbed 2.3 percent. Mazda Motor
Corp., which gets almost 20 percent of its revenue from  Europe ,
jumped 4.8 percent.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest oil explorer by
market value, climbed 3.2 percent after crude prices advanced.  The Nikkei 225 rose 2 percent to 8,776.16 at the 11 a.m.
trading break in Tokyo, set for the biggest gain since Sept. 27.
The broader Topix gained 1.9 percent to 755.87, with almost six
shares rising for each that fell.  Japan ’s Stock markets were
closed yesterday for a national holiday.  “Europe is starting to take some concrete steps toward
recapitalizing its banks,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior
strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co.,
which oversees the equivalent of $84 billion. “That’s driving a
rebound in the market.”  The Topix has lost about 16 percent this year amid concern
U.S. growth is sputtering and Europe’s debt crisis will damage
the banking system. The decline has cut the price of shares on
the index to 0.89 times estimated book value, near the lowest
since March 2009.  Europe Debt  Stocks advanced in Japan today following a rally in U.S.
and European stocks that drove the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
up 3.4 percent yesterday, the biggest gain since August. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index also climbed, capping its biggest four-
day rally since November 2008.  Shares rose after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President Nicholas Sarkozy pledged at the weekend to
deliver a plan to recapitalize Europe’s banks and address
 Greece ’s sovereign-debt crisis by Nov. 3.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial rose 2.3 percent to 2,129 yen
today. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest
publicly traded lender, gained 2.4 percent to 336 yen.  “There is hope that if a comprehensive European bank
package is announced, the damage on the real economy will be
less than currently expected,” said Belinda Allen, a senior
investment analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management in Sydney, which oversees about $145 billion. “That
would be better news for global growth and commodity demand.”  Mazda, Ricoh  Exporters to Europe advanced after the region’s shared
currency appreciated to as high as 104.99 yen today in  Tokyo 
from 102.90 at the close of  stock trading  on Oct. 7.  Mazda jumped 4.8 percent to 154 yen. Office-equipment maker
Ricoh Co., which gets more than 20 percent of its revenue in
Europe, climbed 4.6 percent to 667 yen. Nissan Motor Co., a
carmaker that gets about 80 percent of its sales overseas, rose
2.6 percent to 719 yen.  Japanese shares also advanced after a U.S. jobs report last
week suggested the world’s biggest economy may not be headed for
recession, Mitsubishi UFJ Asset’s Ishigane said. U.S. employers
added 103,000 jobs in September, compared with a median forecast
of 60,000 in Bloomberg survey of economists.  “It looks like the  U.S. economy  isn’t going to fall back
into recession so soon,” Mitsubishi UFJ Asset’s Ishigane said.
“The jobs market isn’t as bad as it looked.”  Energy companies gained after  oil prices  advanced to the
highest since Sept. 21. Inpex gained 3.2 percent to 485,500 yen
and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., the nation’s second-largest
oil explorer by market value, increased 3.2 percent to 2,907 yen.  Fanuc Corp., a maker of industrial robots, contributed the
most to gains on the Nikkei 225, jumping 4.6 percent to 11,480
yen. The Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc. said on Oct. 7 that the
company will be added to the Topix Core 30 index after Oct. 31.
Fanuc will replace Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility at the
center of worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl.  To contact the reporters on this story:
