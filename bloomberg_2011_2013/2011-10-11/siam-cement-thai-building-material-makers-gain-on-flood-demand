Siam Cement Pcl (SCC)  paced gains in
shares of Thai construction-material producers on speculation
demand will surge after the nation’s worst floods in more than
half a century.  Siam Cement, the nation’s largest producer, climbed 5.5
percent to 290 baht at 11:42 a.m. local time, set for the
highest close since Sept. 22.  Siam City Cement Pcl (SCCC) , the second-
biggest maker, rose 5.6 percent to 226 baht.  Tipco Asphalt Pcl (TASCO) ,
the largest asphalt maker, surged 7.3 percent to 55.5 baht, set
for the highest close since April 28.  “Investors are looking to buy shares of companies that
will benefit from a jump in demand in the aftermath of the
flooding,” Sasikorn Charoensuwan, head of research at Phillip
Securities (Thailand) Pcl in Bangkok, said by phone today.
“Home-improvement and building materials will be in great need
as the damage from flooding has been quite severe.”  At least 269 people have been killed and 2.4 million
displaced as a result of heavy monsoon rains that have deluged
the country since July 25, the Department of Disaster Prevention
and Mitigation said today.  Home Product Center Pcl (HMPRO) , the country’s biggest home-
improvement materials retailer, increased 3.4 percent to 9.25
baht, poised for a record close.  Chonburi Concrete Product Pcl (CCP) ,
a producer of concrete walls, blocks and products, advanced 4.5
percent to 2.34 baht.  To contact the reporter on this story:
