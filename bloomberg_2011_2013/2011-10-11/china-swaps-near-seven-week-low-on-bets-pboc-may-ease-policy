China ’s interest-rate swaps fell to
a seven-week low amid speculation the central bank will start
relaxing monetary policy to shield the economy from  Europe ’s
debt turmoil and a sputtering U.S. recovery.  China’s growth will slow in the third and fourth quarters
although the pace won’t decline “excessively,” the Economic
Information Daily reported today, citing Wang Wenbo, deputy
director of the statistics department at the National Bureau of
Statistics. The benchmark money-market rate declined for a
second day as demand for funds eased after last week’s National
Day holiday.  “While our core scenario is for a stable monetary policy,
risks are clearly on the downside given the past tightening,”
said  Frances Cheung , senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in
 Hong Kong . “Should the economic environment warrant some kind
of easing, previous tightening can be quickly reversed.”  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost to receive the
seven-day repurchase rate, sank two basis points to 3.68 percent
in  Shanghai  as of 4:27 p.m. local time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 3.67 percent in intraday
trading, the lowest since Aug. 19. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The seven-day repo rate, a gauge of funding availability in
the financial system, fell 24 basis points to 4.20 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The People’s Bank of China sold 10 billion yuan ($1.6
billion) of one-year bills at an auction today. The yield was
unchanged from the last sale at 3.584 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
