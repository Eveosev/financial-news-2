Europe  can’t withstand another
crisis in the banking system, Finland’s Prime Minister  Jyrki
Katainen  said in an e-mailed statement of comments to be made in
parliament today.  Europe must act to protect countries and “fundamentally
solid banks” from serious risks of contagion, Katainen said.
“Finland and Europe couldn’t withstand another banking system
crisis nor the plunge of new countries into the vortex of the
financial crisis.”  Countries that lost the confidence of markets can earn it
back by responsible fiscal policies, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
