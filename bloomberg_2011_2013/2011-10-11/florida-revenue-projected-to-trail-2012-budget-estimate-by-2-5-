Florida  forecast revenue to trail
estimates by $1.57 billion over two years, joining at least two
dozen states that have projected fiscal 2013 shortfalls.  The revenue outlook announced today by legislative
forecasters may mean the state will be forced to cover another
deficit in the coming fiscal year. Lawmakers have closed $17.8
billion of gaps since 2009.  “The pace of the housing and employment recovery has
significantly slowed,”  Amy Baker , the Legislature’s chief
economist, said today in Tallahassee about the latest revenue
estimate. “The adjustments to the forecast indicate an economy
that is still in the throws of an abnormally slow recovery.”  States may face “widespread” budget cuts this year if
revenue falters, driven by a sagging economy,  Fitch Ratings  said
last week. In its fiscal 2012 first quarter, California revenue
fell $705 million shy of forecasts, Controller John Chiang said
yesterday, raising the chance of automatic spending cuts
affecting universities and services to the elderly and disabled.  Although no further Florida budget cuts are expected this
year, wide-ranging reductions are likely for 2013, state
Representative Denise Grimsley, a Sebring Republican, said last
week. Grimsley, who heads the Legislature’s budget commission,
made the comment after lawmakers were told that the shortfall
next year may reach $2.25 billion.  Lawmakers’ Guidance  “The allocations you’re going to receive more than likely
are going to be less than last year,” she told budget
subcommittee leaders on Oct 6. “It’s going to be another
challenging year for us.”  Collections for the current fiscal year are expected to
fall $599.6 million, or 2.5 percent, below March forecasts. In
2013, revenue will likely trail estimates by $968.3 million, or
3.8 percent, Baker said, citing the report from the forecasters.  To close a $3.8 billion gap in this year’s $69.2 billion
total budget, the state cut payroll costs by 3.6 percent,
reduced spending for schools and began requiring workers to
contribute 3 percent of their salaries toward pensions.  Florida’s reduced revenue forecasts reflect a slowing U.S.
economic recovery from the longest recession in seven decades
and a weak housing market, Baker said in an interview.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg in September forecast U.S.
growth at 2.2 percent next year, down from 3 percent in March.  2012 Buffer  Revenue in fiscal 2012 may trail March estimates by no more
than $273.8 million without creating a deficit, according to a
long-range financial  outlook  adopted by Grimsley’s budget panel
in September. In the first three months of fiscal 2012, which
began July 1, Florida collected about $106 million less than
estimated for the budget, Baker said.  Even before fiscal 2012, 24 states had projected about $46
billion in fiscal 2013 budget gaps, the  Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities , a nonprofit research organization in
 Washington , said in a June report. The group, which focuses on
issues affecting lower-income Americans, said Florida has closed
deficits of $17.8 billion since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
