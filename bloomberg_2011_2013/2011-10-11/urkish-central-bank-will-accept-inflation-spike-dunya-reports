Turkey ’s central bank will accept
faster inflation this year as the price for rebalancing the
economy in favor of exports, Dunya newspaper reported, citing
Hakan Kara, head of the bank’s research department.  The weaker lira may add about 3.5 percentage points to
inflation, Kara said in a speech in Istanbul, according to the
newspaper. More than half of the impact has already been felt
and it will subside in the first quarter of next year, he said.  A slowing economy will limit the second-round effects of
the price rises and the bank is confident of meeting its 2012
inflation target of 5 percent, Kara said.  Trying to drive the rate below 5 percent is “not very
rewarding or effective,” Kara said, answering a question on
what the bank believes is Turkey’s structural rate of inflation,
Dunya said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
