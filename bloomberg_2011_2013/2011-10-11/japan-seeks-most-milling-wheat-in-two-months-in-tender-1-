Japan  is seeking to buy 129,163
metric tons of milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia 
in a regular tender on Oct. 13, the largest volume in two
months, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
said.  Shipment is set from Dec. 1 to Dec. 31, Toshiki Tojo at the
ministry’s grain-trade division said today by phone. The volume
sought is the biggest since Aug. 11, when the government bought
135,846 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 2.6 million tons through
regular tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16 million
tons in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
