Serbia’s foreign-exchange reserves
rose 938.3 million euros ($1.27 billion) to 11.36 billion euros
in September, mostly due to the country’s $1 billion debut
Eurobond sale.  The Sept. 22 sale of 10-year Eurobonds contributed 724.3
million euros to the increase, while 146.5 million euros came
from new mandatory deposits from commercial lenders. Another
28.4 million euros was the inflow from loan facilities and
foreign donations, the Belgrade-based National Bank of Serbia
said in an e-mail today.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , expanded to 6.55 billion euros from 5.81 billion euros in
August, the  Narodna Banka Srbije  said.  On the spending side, the Balkan country paid 80 million
euros to service debt in September and another 7 million euros
for continuing compensation to individuals whose savings were
frozen in the early 1990s.  The size of September’s reserves equaled 446 percent of M1
money supply, or more than eight months of imports and 1,515
percent of short-term debt, the bank said.  Interbank trading volumes fell in September to 2.1 billion
euros from 2.42 billion euros in August, pushing January-
through-September trade volumes to 15 billion euros, the bank
said. The dinar gained a nominal 0.4 percent against the euro in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
