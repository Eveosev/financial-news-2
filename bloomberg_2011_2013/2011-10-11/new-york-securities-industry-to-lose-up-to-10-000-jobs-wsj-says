New York â€™s securities industry may
lose as many as 10,000 jobs by the end of next year, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing a report by state comptroller
 Thomas DiNapoli .  The industry has lost 22,000 jobs since 2008 and the loss
of another 10,000 will be a serious blow to state and city
budgets, DiNapoli was cited as saying; bonuses are also likely
to shrink because of less profit in the industry, the newspaper
reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
