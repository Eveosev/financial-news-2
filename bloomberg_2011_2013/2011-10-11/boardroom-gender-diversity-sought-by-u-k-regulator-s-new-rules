Britain’s accounting regulator is
changing reporting rules for companies listed on the country’s
stock exchanges in a “flexible” effort to increase boardroom
gender diversity without using legal requirements.  Amendments to the  Financial Reporting Council ’s corporate-
governance rules will require companies to report each year what
steps have been taken to implement their boardroom-diversity
policies and explain failures to comply, the watchdog said today
in a statement. The new provisions will apply to financial years
beginning on Oct. 1, 2012.  Britain’s “comply or explain” approach to certain
boardroom rules “can deliver a flexible and rapid response and
is therefore preferable to detailed legal regulation,” Sarah Hogg, the FRC’s chairman, said in the statement.  The new rules, proposed in May by former U.K. trade
minister  Mervyn Davies , add to changes made to the code last
year to make boardrooms more accountable to shareholders, such
as calling for directors to be re-elected annually at companies
listed on the U.K.’s FTSE 350 index. Those amendments were the
first since the bailouts of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and Northern Rock Plc during the
financial crisis.  The FRC said gender diversity also strengthens board
effectiveness by reducing the risk of “group-think,” making
better use of talent and “keeping companies in touch with their
customers,” according to today’s statement. The regulator will
also start including gender as a factor when evaluating a
board’s effectiveness, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
