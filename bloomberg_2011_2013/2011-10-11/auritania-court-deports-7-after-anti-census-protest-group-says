A court in Mauritania ordered seven
foreigners to be expelled after their alleged participation in
an anti-census demonstration last month in Nouakchott, the
capital, according to a group that organized the protest.  Wane Abdul Birane, coordinator of the Don’t Touch My
Nationality organization that protests the population count,
said the foreigners included five Senegalese, one person from
 Mali  and one from  Guinea . They did not take part in the
demonstration on Sept. 29, he said by phone today.  They will be deported immediately, according to Dahmane
Ould Beirouk, director of communications in the Interior
Ministry. On Sept. 30, he said the protests led to the arrests
of 56 people, including 13 foreigners.  Birane’s group claims questions asked on the census survey,
which started in May, discriminate against black Mauritanians.
On Sept. 27, two people were killed in protests against the
census in the southern city of Maghama, 570 kilometers (354
miles) from Nouakchott.  To contact the reporter on this story:
