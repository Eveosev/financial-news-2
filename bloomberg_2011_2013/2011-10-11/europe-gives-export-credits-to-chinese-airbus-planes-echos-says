France , Germany, and the U.K. are to
offer export-credit guarantees for Airbus aircraft assembled in
China,  Les Echos  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Export-credit agencies Coface in France, Euler Hermes in
Germany, and ECGD in Britain, will provide credit guarantees for
A320 single-aisles planes built at an Airbus factory in Tianjin,
China, the newspaper said.  It didn’t specify the amount of credit to be covered by the
guarantees. Chinese customers now buy 20 percent of European
Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.’s Airbus production,  Les Echos 
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
