The U.S. Northeast may cool just
enough to produce an “above-normal” demand for natural gas and
heating oil in about two weeks, said  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  In his 11- to 15-day forecast for Oct. 21 to Oct. 25,
Rogers predicts the mid-Atlantic, Northeast and eastern  Canada 
will all be cooler than normal while the Great Plains region
will be warmer.  “This should provide above-normal early season heating
demand, but no major chill is expected,” Rogers said today in a
note to clients.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants use
about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  In his 6- to 10-day outlook for Oct. 16 to Oct. 20, Rogers,
based in Bethesda,  Maryland , predicts the Northeast and
southwestern U.S. will be about 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.6
Celsius) warmer than normal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
