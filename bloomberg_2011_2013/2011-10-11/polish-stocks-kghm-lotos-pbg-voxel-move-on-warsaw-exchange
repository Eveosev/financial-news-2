Poland’s WIG20 Index fell 0.2
percent to 2,273.40, falling for the first day in five.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, fell 1.1 percent to 141.4 zloty,
retreating for the first time in five days. Copper declined on
concern about the outlook for demand in top global consumer
 China , where figures due this week may show slower growth in
exports.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)   fell 1.4 percent to 24.17 zloty
after Mariusz Machajewski, the chief financial officer, said
Poland’s second-largest oil refiner won’t be able to reach its
forecast of 1 billion zloty ($314 million) in 2011 net income at
the current zloty rate, which pushes up the value of its foreign
debt.  PBG SA (PBG)   jumped 4.1 percent to 83 zloty, extending
yesterday’s 8.9 percent gain. The construction company, the
worst-performing stock in the WIG20 Index this year, raised its
sales forecast by 30 percent to about 3 billion zloty ($942
million) and earnings before interest and taxes by 13 percent to
about 260 million zloty yesterday.  Voxel SA (VOX PW) slumped 24 percent to 14.5 zloty as the
provider of medical diagnostic services started trading on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange’s NewConnect market for smaller companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
