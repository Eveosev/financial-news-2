Indonesia  will maintain 2012
subsidized-fuel prices at this year’s level, Melchias Mekeng,
head of the parliament’s budget committee, said during a meeting
with the government in Jakarta today.  Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo  and the committee agreed
to the pricing structure, Meking said. They also agreed to keep
the volume of subsidized fuel at 40 million kiloliters, valued
at 123.6 trillion rupiah ($13.8 billion), as previously
proposed, Vice Finance Minister Anny Ratnawati told reporters
after the meeting.  Indonesia’s central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark
interest rate today for the first time in more than two years to
spur growth as the global recovery weakens and inflation slows.  Bank Indonesia lowered the reference rate by a quarter of a
percentage point to 6.5 percent, joining emerging-market nations
 Brazil , Turkey, Russia and Pakistan in reducing borrowing costs
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
