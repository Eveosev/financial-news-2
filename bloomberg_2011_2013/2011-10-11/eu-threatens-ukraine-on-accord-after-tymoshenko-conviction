Ukraine put a planned trade and
association agreement with the European Union at risk by jailing
former Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko , the EU said.  The EU is “deeply disappointed” with the conviction for
abuse of power, European Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic
 told reporters  in Brussels today. It “risks having profound
implications for the EU-Ukraine bilateral relationship including
for the conclusion of the association agreement, our political
dialogue and our cooperation more broadly.”  The EU called on Ukraine “to ensure a fair, transparent
and impartial process in any appeal.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
