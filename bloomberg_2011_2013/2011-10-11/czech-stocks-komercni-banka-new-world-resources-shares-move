The Czech Republic’s PX stock index

4:28 p.m. close in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  , Societe Generale SA’s Czech
unit, slumped 2.9 percent to 3,420 koruna, the biggest decline
in a week. European stocks fell and the euro weakened against
the dollar amid uncertainty that  Slovakia  will ratify an

coal producer, slid 1.7 percent to 136.71 koruna, snapping a
four-day rally.  Europe ’s benchmark coal derivatives declined 0.4
