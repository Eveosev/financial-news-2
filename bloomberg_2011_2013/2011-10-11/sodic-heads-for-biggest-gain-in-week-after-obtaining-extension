Six of October Development &
Investment (OCDI)  Co. headed for the biggest gain in more than a week
after the Egyptian government granted it an extension to acquire
building permits.  Shares of the Egyptian luxury real-estate developer also
known as Sodic jumped 3.9 percent to 13.5 Egyptian pounds,
heading for the biggest daily gain since Oct. 2. Egyptâ€™s
benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  gained 1.2 percent.  The state-run New Urban Communities Authority gave the
company six months to obtain building permits for the remaining
undeveloped portion of its land in west Cairo, Sodic said today.
The authority is still reviewing the three-year development
schedule for the area, representing 19 percent of the west Cairo
land plot owned by Sodic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
