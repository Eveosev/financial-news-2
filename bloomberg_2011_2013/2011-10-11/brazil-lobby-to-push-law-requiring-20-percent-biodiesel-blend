A Brazilian lobbying group that says
it has support from almost half the nation’s lawmakers will push
to quadruple the nation’s biodiesel market.  The Parliamentary Front for the Defense of Biodiesel will
press the government to issue a new regulation next year that
will require diesel sold in the nation as of 2020 to be a blend
of 80 percent diesel and 20 percent biodiesel. Diesel now sold
in  Brazil  contains 5 percent biodiesel.  “We’ll work with the executive and ministries to drive
this,” Congressman Jeronimo Goergen, who will act as president
of the group, said yesterday in an interview. “There’s enough
raw material here to support a higher blend.”  Brazil has 67 biodiesel plants with capacity to produce 6.4
billion liters of fuel a year, regulator Agencia Nacional do
Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis said on its  website .
Last year the country consumed about 2.4 billion liters,
according to ANP.  The Parliamentary Front, which will be formally established
on Oct. 19, will find support from 270 members of Brazil’s lower
and upper houses, according to Goergen, who belongs to the
Progressive Party. Brazil’s Congress has 594 members, he said.
