EBay Inc. (EBAY) , trying to lure
developers, merchants and consumers to its PayPal system, will
unveil a service that lets people use their accounts in
different Web stores without having to register at each one.  The new feature, called PayPal Access, will be announced
tomorrow at a San Francisco conference focused on EBay’s new
 X.commerce platform , an arm of the business aimed at developers
and merchants, said Anuj Nayar, an X.commerce spokesman.  EBay Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe is trying to ward
off rival payment systems and get more consumers to use PayPal
as a substitute for credit cards. The company is counting on the
X.commerce technology to attract e-commerce sites and shoppers
to PayPal by making buying and selling easier online.  “You can create an account wherever you’re shopping
without giving the merchant your information,” Nayar said in an
interview. By relying on PayPal developers to handle the
innovation, Web retailers can make their sites easier and more
functional without doing it themselves, he said. “These
retailers don’t have the time and resources necessary to figure
it all out.”  PayPal Access would need cooperation from retail partners,
something it doesn’t yet have, he said.  EBay shares rose 53 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.83 today.
The company’s stock has gained 18 percent this year.  Magento System  This week’s conference is aimed at the almost 800,000
developers who design software for EBay and PayPal, as well as
Magento, an e-commerce platform that helps merchants manage
payments, inventory and customer relationships online. EBay
announced an application store for that system today called
Magento Connect, letting programmers create and sell software.
EBay acquired the Magento business earlier this year.  EBay also will update its RedLaser application, a company
it acquired in June 2010 that allows mobile users to scan bar
codes. The newest version will let consumers pay for products
they scan over their phones, Nayar said.  PayPal had 100.3 million active registered accounts at the
end of the second quarter, up 15 percent from the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
