(Corrects story after Reuters withdraws earlier report.)  Ugandan lawmakers haven’t voted yet
on whether to postpone the completion of  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) ’s sale
of stakes in its interests in the East African country, Reuters
reported.  Legislators have also yet to agree on whether to impose a
moratorium on new petroleum accords until a new industry law is
created, the news agency said.  Reuters withdrew an earlier report stating that votes on
the two motions had taken place.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
