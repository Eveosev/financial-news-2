Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said
new housing starts rose in September on a jump in multiple-unit
projects.  Starts rose 7.3 percent to 205,900 units at a seasonally
adjusted annual pace, the Ottawa-based agency said. The August
figure was also revised to 191,900 from 184,700. Economists
forecast a September reading of 190,000, according to the median
of 19 responses to a Bloomberg News survey.  Demand for homes has been fueled by low borrowing costs,
with the average five-year fixed mortgage rate at 5.19 percent
in the last two weeks of September, matching a low set in
November. Further gains may be restrained by tighter mortgage
requirements imposed by regulators in response to record levels
of consumer debt.  “While the prevailing environment of low  interest rates 
will provide additional support to the housing market, the
exhaustion of pent-up demand is nevertheless expected to
translate to a slower pace of activity,”  David Tulk , chief
Canada macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities
unit, said in a note to clients.  In urban areas, multiple-dwelling starts increased 14
percent to 118,000 units, on gains in British Columbia,  Quebec 
and on the east coast, CMHC said today. Single-family projects
fell 1.5 percent to 67,900 units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
