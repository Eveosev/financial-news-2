Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said Federal Reserve purchases of Treasuries are damaging
the country’s fiscal discipline and the U.S. is taking advantage
of the dollar’s “monopoly” as the main reserve currency.  “Maybe our American colleagues know better, but back in
the day, this wasn’t how they were advising us to act,” Putin
said in an interview with Chinese state media in Beijing today.
“America is being parasitic with the dollar’s monopoly
position. I didn’t say that it’s a parasite on the world
economy.”  Putin said the U.S. should work together with  Europe  and
and the so-called BRICS -- Brazil, Russia, India,  China  and
 South Africa  -- during Group of 20 meetings to find solutions to
global imbalances.  Russia , which has the world’s third-largest
reserves, has reduced its holdings of U.S. government debt by 43
percent from a record high on Oct. 31, 2010, to $100.2 billion
as of July 31, Treasury data show.  An announcement by Germany and France that they intend to
support the euro is a “positive signal” as Europe struggles to
resolve its debt crisis, Putin said. Troubles there are
primarily political because Greece only represents 2 percent of
the European Union’s economy, he said.  European leaders will need to show “courage” to
concentrate their political forces on finding a solution,
“because the people in those countries aren’t very happy,”
Putin said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
