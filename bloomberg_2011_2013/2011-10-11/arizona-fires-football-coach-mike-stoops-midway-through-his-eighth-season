The  University of Arizona  fired
football coach Mike Stoops midway through his eighth season, two
days after the Wildcats fell to their fifth straight defeat,
against the previously winless Oregon State.  Defensive Coordinator Tim Kish will take charge for the
remainder of the season while a search for a replacement is
conducted, Athletic Director Greg Byrne told reporters.  “Now is the time for new leadership and direction,”  Byrne
said  last night. “We will make the best decision for Arizona
football and we are open to a variety of candidates.”  Stoops, 49, went 41-50 after being named the 28th coach in
the 108-year-old program’s history in November 2004. He leaves
with the Wildcats 1-5 this season and in last place in the six-
team Pac-12 South division.  Stoops guided the Wildcats to three straight bowl
appearances through 2010, when  Arizona  peeked at No. 9 in the
Associated Press poll on Sept. 18. The team began 7-1 last
season before losing their last five games, including a 36-10
defeat to Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl.  “I am very proud of the Wildcat football program and the
many accomplishments we have enjoyed,” Stoops said in a
statement. “Topping that list is our qualifying for consecutive
bowl games the last three seasons for only the second time in
school history.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
