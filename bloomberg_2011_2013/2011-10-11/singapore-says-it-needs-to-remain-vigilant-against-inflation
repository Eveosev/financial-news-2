Singapore said it needs to remain
vigilant against a resurgence in inflationary pressures even as
it expects price gains to moderate toward the end of 2011.  “A stable  Singapore dollar  is an anchor of stability for
our small, open economy,” the government said in a statement
today to elaborate on the plans presented by the city-state’s
president in parliament yesterday. “Continued judicious
management of the effective exchange rate of the Singapore
dollar against a trade-weighted basket of currencies will help
dampen inflationary pressures while supporting economic growth
in an uncertain and volatile external environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
