The U.S. corn harvest was 33 percent
complete as of Oct. 9, compared with 21 percent at the same time
a week earlier and the previous five-year average of 32 percent,
the Department of Agriculture said.  An estimated 51 percent of the soybean crop was harvested,
up from 19 percent a week earlier and the five-year average of
46 percent for the date, the USDA said today in  report .  About 59 percent of the winter-wheat crop was planted,
below the five-year average of 67 percent, according to the
report. A week earlier, 42 percent of the crop had been sown.
The USDAâ€™s weekly crop progress report was delayed to today
because government offices were closed yesterday for Columbus
Day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
