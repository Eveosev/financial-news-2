The Australian dollar declined
against the U.S. currency after Slovakia’s ruling coalition
failed to end a dispute over participation in a euro-area
bailout fund, damping demand for higher-yielding assets.  The  New Zealand  dollar fell against most of its 16 major
peers after government financial statements showed the nation’s
 budget deficit  was wider in the fiscal year ended June 30 than
earlier forecast. Losses were limited for the South Pacific
nations’ currencies as Asian stocks gained.  “Risk-correlated currencies could trade sideways over the
next month as we wait for more positive developments out of
Europe,” said Roland Randall, a Singapore-based strategist for
rates and foreign exchange at TD Securities Inc., who expects
the Australian dollar could fall as low as 92 U.S. cents. “A
bigger budget deficit does weaken the outlook for New Zealand at
a margin and therefore make it more vulnerable to rising risk
aversion.”  Australia ’s dollar declined to 99.66 cents at 2:47 p.m. in
Sydney, from 99.88 cents in  New York  yesterday. The currency
dropped 0.2 percent to 76.40 yen. New Zealand’s dollar slid 0.2
percent to 78.21 U.S. cents from yesterday. The kiwi lost 0.2
percent to 59.98 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
