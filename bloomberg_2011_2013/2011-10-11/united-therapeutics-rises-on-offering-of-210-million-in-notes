United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR) â€™s shares
rose the most in almost a year after the biotechnology company
said it will offer $210 million of convertible senior notes to
qualified institutional buyers and buy back shares.  The company, seller of treatments for cardiovascular
diseases, gained 5 percent to $39.74, the biggest increase since
Oct. 28.  The offering of the notes due 2016 may include an option
for the initial purchaser to buy as much as an additional $40
million, the  Silver Spring , Maryland-based company said in a
statement today.  United said it expects to reduce future stock dilution
through a convertible note hedge transaction. The company also
said it will buy back as much as $212 million in shares as part
of a $300 million repurchase program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
