Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  advanced 2.3 percent to
3,531.75, rising for a second day.  Banks: PT Bank Mandiri (BMRI IJ),  Indonesia ’s biggest
lender by assets, increased 3.2 percent to 6,450 rupiah and PT
Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI IJ), the largest by revenue, climbed
3.3 percent to 6,250 rupiah.  The Indonesian central bank unexpectedly cut today its
benchmark  interest rate  for the first time in more than two
years to spur economic growth as the global recovery weakens and
inflation slows.  Energy companies: PT Energi Mega Persada (ENRG IJ), the
nation’s second-largest listed oil company, rallied 3.2 percent
to 129 rupiah. PT Medco Energi Internasional (MEDC IJ), the
biggest, rose 4.8 percent to 2,200 rupiah. Oil futures climbed
to a two-week high, advancing 2.9 percent to $85.41 a barrel in
 New York  yesterday. Crude last traded at $84.58 a barrel.  PT Bumi Resources (BUMI IJ), Indonesia’s biggest coal
producer, climbed 3.1 percent to 1,980 rupiah, the highest close
this month. The company said it sold coal to an East Asian buyer
at $133 a metric ton. Bumi said on Oct. 6 that it sold coal at
an average price of $93 a ton in the third quarter.  PT Solusi Tunas Pratama (SUPR IJ), a developer and builder
of telecommunication towers, surged 7.4 percent to 3,650 rupiah
on its trading debut. The company raised 340 billion rupiah ($38
million) in an initial public offering this month to invest in
new towers and acquisitions.  PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (PTBA IJ), the state-owned
coal producer, jumped 9 percent to 15,100 rupiah, the biggest
rally since June 1, 2009. The shares rebounded from an 18
percent drop this month through yesterday after gains in  oil
prices  raised speculation the plunge was excessive, according to
Andrian Tanuwijaya, an analyst at Jakarta-based PT Trimegah
Securities. A higher oil price increases the appeal of
alternative fuels such as coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
