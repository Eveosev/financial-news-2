Ghana ’s cedi rebounded from the
weakest on record and headed for the biggest gain in more than
five months as the central bank sold dollars.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
appreciated 0.8 percent to 1.6150 per dollar as of 2:47 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, reversing a decline to 1.6325, the weakest
since at least March 1994, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A close at this level will be the cedi’s biggest gain
since April 28.  “The central bank was in the market selling some U.S.
dollars today,” Lourens Harmse, a Johannesburg-based currency
trader at Absa Capital Ltd.. wrote in an e-mailed comment. “The
volume could not have been more than the usual amounts.”  The  Bank of Ghana  sold more than $100 million today to meet
requests from  oil companies  and lenders’ clients, Adams Nyinaku,
head of treasury at the Accra-based bank, said in a telephone
interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
