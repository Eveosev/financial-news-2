Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker didn’t mean to signal in an Austrian television
interview that haircuts on  Greece  could exceed 60 percent, a
spokesman said.    Juncker instead meant that haircuts could exceed the 21
percent already agreed in July, said Guy Schuller, a spokesman
for the Luxembourg government, by telephone today.   Asked yesterday to comment on speculation that losses to
investors will exceed 21 percent and may instead be between 50
percent and 60 percent, Juncker told Austrian television “we’re
talking about even more.” He didn’t comment further in the
interview.   To contact the reporter on this story:
