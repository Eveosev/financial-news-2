Saudi Arabian Mining Co., the state-
run producer known as Ma’aden, posted a third-quarter profit
because of higher  gold prices  and lower taxes.  Net income was 27.4 million riyals ($7.3 million) after a
loss of 200,000 riyals a year earlier, the company said in a
 statement  to the  Saudi bourse  today. The median estimate of two
analysts was for a profit of 61 million riyals, according to
data on Bloomberg.  Ma’aden, whose main focus is gold mining, is expanding by
adding three new business lines, including aluminium and
phosphate, to tap rising demand for chemicals used in
agriculture and the lightweight metal to make beverage cans and
aircraft. A joint venture between Ma’aden and New York-based
 Alcoa Inc. (AA)  started construction at an alumina refinery in Ras Al
Khair, Alcoa said on Aug. 10.  Profit was achieved as gold prices rose, sales increased
and Islamic social taxes, or Zakat, fell, according to the
statement. The average gold price was $1,703 an ounce in the
third quarter compared with $1,227 an ounce in the year-earlier
period. Gold traded at $1,671 an ounce at 9.34 a.m. in  Riyadh .  Ma’aden shares fell 0.4 percent to 25 riyals in Riyadh
yesterday, valuing the company at 23.1 billion riyals. The stock
has gained 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
