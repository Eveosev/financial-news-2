Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) ’s Sabine Pass
terminal in Louisiana is scheduled to receive a cargo of
liquefied natural gas Oct. 18, according to vessel tracking data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The tanker LNG Pioneer can move as much as 138,000 cubic
meters of LNG, the data showed. That’s about 2.97 billion cubic
feet of gas, equivalent to 4.5 percent of estimated daily U.S.
gas production.  The Sabine Pass facility can regasify and send out 4
billion cubic feet a day of natural gas to pipelines, making it
the biggest LNG terminal in  North America .  Another ship, Aamira, is arriving at  Repsol YPF SA (REP) ’s
Canaport LNG terminal in  Canada  on Oct. 19, according to the
 Saint John Port Authority .  The terminal, in Saint John,  New Brunswick , can put as much
as 1.2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas into pipelines.
Repsol,  Spain ’s largest oil producer, owns 75 percent of
Canaport while Saint John-based Irving Oil Corp. owns 25
percent.  LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back into a gas.  The following table shows LNG tankers scheduled to arrive
in North America, according to the tracking data. Vessel
capacity is converted to billion cubic feet of natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
