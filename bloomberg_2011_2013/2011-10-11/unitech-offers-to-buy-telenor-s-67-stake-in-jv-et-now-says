Telenor ASA (TEL)  rose to its highest
in five months in Oslo trading after Indian television
channel ET Now reported that partner  Unitech Ltd. (UT)  offered
to buy Telenor’s 67 percent stake in their Indian phone
venture Uninor.  Telenor, the Nordic region’s largest phone company,
added as much as 3.8 percent to 95.4 kroner, the highest
intraday price since May 19, and was trading up 0.6 percent
at 92.45 kroner as of 10:56 a.m.  Telenor, which has units in Pakistan and Bangladesh,
opened the  India  unit with Unitech in 2009. Unitech has
blocked a rights issue proposed by Telenor. Tanuja Kehar, a
Unitech spokeswoman, would neither confirm or deny the bid
when contacted by Bloomberg News. Tor Odland, a Telenor
spokesman, said he had “no particular comment” on today’s
report and added that the company’s position on financing
remains the same.  “I struggle to believe that Telenor are sellers,”
 Robin Bienenstock , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co., said by phone today. “They seem to have greater
ambitions in India. Were that to happen it would be very
good for the stock and would make shareholders very happy.
I would encourage the CEO of Telenor to embrace a good
offer, but my guess is that he won’t.”  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
