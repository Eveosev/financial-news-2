Foreign direct investment into  South
Korea  declined 24.6 percent in the third quarter, the first drop
in a year, damped by the European debt crisis and a downgrade of
the U.S. credit rating.  Investment totaled $2.21 billion in the three months to
Sept. 30, down from $2.93 billion a year earlier, the Ministry
of Knowledge Economy said in an e-mailed statement today. The
preliminary data don’t include short-term capital inflows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
