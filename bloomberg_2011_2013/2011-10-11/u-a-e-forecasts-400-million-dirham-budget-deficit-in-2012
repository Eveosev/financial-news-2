The proposed  United Arab Emirates 
federal budget for next year will include a 400 million-dirham
($109 million) deficit,  state-run WAM reported  after Cabinet
ministers approved the spending plan today.  The projected shortfall compares with a federal deficit of
3 billion dirhams in the current budget, which was approved by
the Federal National Council in December.  Revenue for 2012 is forecast at 41.4 billion dirhams and
spending at 41.8 billion dirhams, according to the  news agency .
The 2011 budget included revenue of 41 billion dirhams. Social-
services spending for next year is expected to be 19.7 billion
dirhams, an increase from the 15 billion allocated for 2011.  While the U.A.E. has been spared the level of social unrest
that toppled the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt , it has taken
measures to appease people in outlying areas. The government
said in June it would allocate 7 billion dirhams of its budget
to housing loans for citizens to maintain “social stability.”
In March, the government announced a 5.7 billion-dirham package
of water and infrastructure projects in the northern emirates.  WAM didn’t say whether the 2012 budget gives a projected
oil price on which the latest budget is based for the U.A.E.,
which controls about 7 percent of the world’s crude supply.  The government boosted spending for health care and higher
education by 100 million dirhams in the spending plan, WAM said.
Government-affairs spending, which include defense, justice,
foreign affairs and the interior ministry, will account for 42
percent of the budget, or 17.5 billion dirhams. Spending on
infrastructure, including roads, schools and hospitals, will
total 600 million dirhams.  The economy is forecast to grow 3.3 percent this year and
3.8 percent in 2012, the  International Monetary Fund  said in
September.  The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven emirates
on the  Persian Gulf  -- the capital of  Abu Dhabi , Dubai, Ajman,
Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujeirah and Umm al-Quwain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
