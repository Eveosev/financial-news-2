Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., which
resumed trading in May after a five-year suspension, advanced
for the first day in as sell-offs by long-time shareholders
slowed down.  Shares in  Kenya ’s only publicly traded retailer climbed as
much as 5.3 percent to 8.90 shillings before trading 1.8 percent
higher at 8.60 shillings by 10:45 a.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  “We have seen the tail-end of the selling pressure of the
people who are selling after holding the stock for so long,”
 Aly-Khan Satchu , chief executive officer of Rich Management, a
Nairobi-based  investment adviser  to high-net-worth individuals,
said in a phone interview today.  The company went into receivership in June 2006 with debts
of 2.2 billion shillings ($21 million), of which 957 million
shillings was owed to  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB)  and PTA Bank
Ltd. The receivership ended in March 2010, after most of the
company’s debts were cleared and others converted into shares.
The shares resumed trading May this year.  “Consumers are price sensitive; I can see a move to get
better value for money and I think Uchumi is delivering a better
deal for your shilling,” Satchu said.  Kenya is struggling to bring down an inflation rate that
soared for the 11th month to 17.3 percent in September, more
than triple its 5 percent goal. Investors and lawmakers have
criticized the central bank for failing to curb inflation after
it lowered the benchmark  interest rate  to a record low in
January and then reversed the decision two months later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
