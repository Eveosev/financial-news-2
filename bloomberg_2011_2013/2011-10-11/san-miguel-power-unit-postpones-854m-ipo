San Miguel Corp. (SMC) ’s power unit
delayed an $854 million initial public offering that would have
been the Philippines’ biggest first-time share sale, said two
people with knowledge of the matter.  San Miguel ’s SMC Global Power Holdings Corp.’s put the IPO
on hold because of volatile markets, said one of the people, who
declined to be identified as the decision hasn’t been made
public.  The Philippines’ securities regulator last month approved
SMC Global Power’s plan to sell up to 519.8 million shares at as
much as 71 pesos apiece. Including options to expand the IPO, it
might have raised as much as 36.9 billion pesos ($854 million),
according to a Sept. 26 filing by SMC Global Power.  That would have made it the largest IPO in the country,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. SM Investments Corp.
raised about 28.8 billion pesos in 2005 in a first-time share
offering, and Cebu Air Inc.’s 2010 IPO collected 23.3 billion
pesos.  Proceeds from the deal will fund expansion projects,
including new  power plants  and the purchase of existing ones,
SMC Global Power said in the Sept. 26 filing.  San Miguel, which started as a brewer in 1890, eight years
before the Philippines’ declared independence from  Spain , has
been expanding into other industries to boost returns to three
times the 7 percent it used to earn from food and drinks alone.
Oil refining unit  Petron Corp. (PCOR)  accounts for about a third of the
Philippine oil market, while SMC Global controls 17.5 percent of
the nation’s power generation capacity.  San Miguel in August agreed to buy three Exxon Mobil Corp.
units in  Malaysia  for $610 million in its first purchase of
overseas oil assets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
