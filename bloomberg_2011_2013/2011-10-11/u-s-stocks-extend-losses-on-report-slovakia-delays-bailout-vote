U.S. stocks extended losses
following a Wall Street Journal report that Slovakia has delayed
its vote on enhancing the European bailout fund, fueling concern
the region’s debt crisis will worsen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent to
1,192.09 at 12:52 p.m. in  New York  after drifting between gains
and losses for most of the day.  A repeat vote on enhancing the rescue fund is unlikely to
take place on Wednesday and may be held later this week, the
newspaper reported on its website, without citing anyone.
Slovakia is the only nation that hasn’t approved the measure.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
