Telenor ASA (TEL)  had no comment today
after ET Now television channel reported that  Unitech Ltd. (UT) 
offered to buy its 67 percent stake in their Indian phone
venture.  “We have no particular comment,” Tor Odland, a Telenor
spokesman, said by phone today. “Our position remains as
previous in terms of the financing question.”  Unitech has opposed Telenor’s efforts to implement a rights
issue to put more money into the venture.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
