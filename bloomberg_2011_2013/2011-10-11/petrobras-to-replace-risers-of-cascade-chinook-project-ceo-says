Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazilâ€™s
state-controlled oil producer, plans to replace the faulty
risers in its Cascade Chinook deepwater project in the Gulf of
Mexico, Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli told
journalists today in London.  Technip SA (TEC)  will provide the new risers, Gabrielli said.
Petrobras aims to have the Cascade Chinook project onstream by
the end of the year, according to Gabrielli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
