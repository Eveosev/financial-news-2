 Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos
said lawmakers should back the European Financial Stability
Facility, the euro region’s enhanced bailout fund, this week.  He was speaking to Parliament today, where lawmakers were
expected to reject the EFSF bill, which was tied to a no-
confidence vote against Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova .  “There is likelihoood that the bailout fund will
eventually be approved this week, one way or the other,” Miklos
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
