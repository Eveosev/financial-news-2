The Financial Services Authority
can’t use a pair of e-mails as part of an investigation into
Keydata Investment Services Ltd., after a judge said the
electronic data was covered by the attorney-client privilege.  The e-mails sent by Keydata founder Stewart Ford and other
directors to legal advisers was obtained unlawfully, Judge Ian
Burnett in  London  said today. The judicial review has forced the
FSA to suspend its four-year-old investigation into Keydata,
which was forced into administration in 2009.  “This episode, along with the FSA continually ignoring its
own guidance and procedures in its investigation into Keydata,
raises serious questions about the regulator’s own conduct,”
Ford’s solicitor Harvey Knight said. He said the FSA should
review its procedures in light of the ruling.  Keydata was placed under the control of administrators at
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC in June 2009 amid an FSA
investigation into the company, which had managed as much as 2.8
billion pounds ($4.4 billion) before it failed. Today’s ruling
is the first time an FSA-initiated probe has been the subject of
a successful judicial review, Keydata said in an e-mailed
statement.  FSA spokeswoman Andrea Kinnear said the judge ruled that
another six e-mails weren’t covered by privilege.  “There will be a further hearing in due course to
determine remedy,” she said in an e-mailed statement today.  The FSA was investigating the sale and marketing of
investment products at the Reading, England-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
