Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) , the
fourth-largest U.S. cable company, said Chief Executive Officer
Mike Lovett will step down on April 30, 2012, or earlier.  Lovett, 50, will remain CEO as Charter searches for a
successor, the company said in a statement today. Lovett joined
Charter in August 2003 and was named president and CEO in April
2010 after serving as the company’s executive vice president and
chief operating officer.  Charter, which emerged from bankruptcy in November 2009,
may post its first quarterly profit next month since Lovett took
over as CEO, according to the average estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The St. Louis-based company lost 80,000
video subscribers last quarter, its largest decline since
bankruptcy, as the economy and competitors to  cable television 
eroded its customer base.  “With Charter on strong footing, I believe this is the
right time for me to move on to the next chapter of my career,”
Lovett said in the statement. The company declined to comment on
Lovett’s future.  The decision to leave was Lovett’s, according to Anita Lamont, a company spokeswoman. More than 32 percent of the
company’s tradable equity is owned by private-equity firm Apollo
Global Management LLC. Marla Sheiner, an Apollo spokeswoman,
didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
