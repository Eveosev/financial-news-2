India ’s 10-year bonds rose for the
first time in nine days on speculation yields at the highest
level in three years will lure investors.  The yield has climbed 27 basis points since the finance
ministry said Sept. 29 it will borrow 32 percent more than
earlier planned in the six months ending March 31. Bonds gained
on speculation the central bank will refrain from boosting
borrowing costs at a policy review this month as  Europe ’s debt
crisis threatens to hurt the global economy.  “There was probably some value buying as yields have risen
sharply in recent days,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income
trader at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “There was also
some hope that the central bank may pause raising  interest
rates .”  The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April 2021 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.71 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
price increased 0.26, or 26 rupees per 10,000 rupee face amount,
to 94.22.  The finance ministry will sell a record 4.7 trillion rupees
($96.3 billion) of securities in the year ending March 2012,
compared with an earlier estimate of 4.17 trillion rupees, R. Gopalan, secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, said
last month.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has increased the repurchase rate
six times this year to 8.25 percent to damp inflation that has
held above 8 percent for 20 months. The next policy review is on
Oct. 25. The wholesale  price index  may have risen 9.75 percent
in September, according to the median of estimates of 17
economists in a Bloomberg survey before the data is published on
Oct. 14.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell 19 basis points to 7.90 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
