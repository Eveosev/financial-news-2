The European Systemic Risk Board,
the region’s risk watchdog, said national authorities should
tighten rules governing foreign-currency lending.  “High levels of foreign currency lending may have systemic
consequences for the countries concerned as well as potential
for cross-border contagion,” the ESRB said in an e-mailed
statement today.   In a number of recommendations released today, the agency
said borrowers should be given the appropriate information to
make decisions and credit institutions should properly
incorporate foreign-currency lending risks into their internal
risk-management processes.  “Regarding excessive credit growth induced by foreign
currency lending and the possibility of the emergence of asset
price misalignments, national authorities are recommended to
further tighten their rules on foreign currency lending,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
