U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
rose more than average last week as mild weather limited demand
for the heating fuel, according to analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Inventories gained 102 billion cubic feet, or 3 percent, to
3.511 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Oct. 7, based on the
median of eight estimates. The five-year average increase for
the week is 72 billion, according to Energy Department data.
Supplies climbed 90 billion cubic feet a year earlier,  Temperatures were in a normal range in the U.S. Northeast
last week and were above normal in the Midwest, according to
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland . The low in
 New York  on Oct. 5 was 53 degrees Fahrenheit (12 Celsius), 1
degree below normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State
College ,  Pennsylvania .  “The weather was pretty warm last week,” said Eric Bickel, an analyst at Summit Energy Services Inc. in Louisville,
 Kentucky , a subsidiary of Schneider Electric SA. “The supply
side of the equation continues to provide upside to the storage
number.”  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 83 billion
to 112 billion cubic feet. The department’s weekly supply report
is scheduled for release Oct. 13 at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Stockpiles rose 97 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Sept. 30 to 3.409 trillion cubic feet, the Energy Department
reported last week. The five-year average increase for the week
is 74 billion cubic feet. Inventories were 0.8 percent above the
five-year average, wider than a surplus of 0.2 percent the
previous week, according to the department.  Marketed gas production will average 65.79 billion cubic
feet a day in 2011, up 6.4 percent from 61.83 billion last year,
the Energy Department said in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook, released Sept. 7.  The total of about 24 trillion cubic feet for the year
would be the highest in department records going back to 1900.  Natural gas for November delivery fell 18.5 cents, or 5.1
percent, to $3.481 per million British thermal units last week
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices today rose 7.5 cents
to $3.616.  To contact the reporter on this story:
