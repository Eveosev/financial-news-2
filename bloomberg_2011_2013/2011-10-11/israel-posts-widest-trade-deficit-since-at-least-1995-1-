Israel  posted its widest trade
deficit since at least 1995 as imports rose.  The gap, excluding polished diamonds, ships and aircraft,
widened to a seasonally adjusted $1.9 billion in September from
$1.7 billion the previous month, the  Jerusalem-based Central
Bureau of Statistics  said on its website today. Imports rose 3.5
percent to $5.5 billion, while exports increased 1.1 percent to
$3.7 billion.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  cut the benchmark
interest rate for the first time in 2 1/2 years on Sept. 26,
joining countries including Turkey and Brazil in reducing
lending costs on the threat of a global slowdown. Fischer
lowered the rate by a quarter point to 3 percent.  The rate cut followed a Sept. 22 announcement that the
central bank had reduced its forecast for Israeli economic
growth next year to 3.2 percent from 3.9 percent, citing
increased uncertainty about the global economy and a decline in
the rate of growth in world trade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
