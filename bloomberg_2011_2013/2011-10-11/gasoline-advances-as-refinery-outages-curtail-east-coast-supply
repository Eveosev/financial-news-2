Gasoline rose to a three-week high
on speculation fuel output will decline as refinery shutdowns
and maintenance curb supply on the U.S. East Coast.  Futures gained as refinery rates probably fell 0.78
percentage point to 86.9 percent last week, according to the
median estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.
Sunoco Inc. shut a fluid catalytic cracker for repairs at its
Marcus Hook refinery in  Pennsylvania , according to state
regulators.  “People think we’re going to cut down utilization rates
and you’ll have tighter supplies,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for November delivery gained 5.23 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $2.7476 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after touching $2.6685. It’s the highest
settlement price since Sept. 16.  The November contract’s premium to December futures widened
to 7.12 cents from 6.29 cents yesterday.  ConocoPhillips stopped production at its Trainer,
Pennsylvania, refinery Sept. 30, saying if it couldn’t find a
buyer, the plant would be shut permanently in six months.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.3 percent at
3:49 p.m. in  New York , after falling as much as 0.6 percent
earlier.  Heating oil for November delivery rose 0.02 cent to settle
at $2.9041 a gallon on the exchange.  Supplies of diesel and heating oil in the U.S. probably
fell 500,000 barrels last week, according to the median estimate
of 15 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News. Gasoline
stockpiles were unchanged.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
U.S. inventories at 11 a.m. on Oct. 13 in  Washington .  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.1
cent to $3.396 yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
