Central Huijin Investment Ltd.’s
announcement that it has started buying shares of  China ’s four-
biggest banks will bolster the stock market, according to China
International Capital Corp.  “We should expect at least some relief on selling pressure
from this move by Huijin, if history is a guide,” Hao Hong, a
Beijing-based global equity strategist, said in a report to
clients. Central Huijin, a unit of China’s sovereign wealth
fund, started acquiring stock in  Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China (601398)  Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp.,  Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd. (601288)  and  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  yesterday, according to a
statement on its website.  On Sept. 18, 2008, Central Huijin announced it would buy
shares of ICBC, Construction Bank and Bank of China, spurring a
21 percent rally for the Shanghai Composite Index within a week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
