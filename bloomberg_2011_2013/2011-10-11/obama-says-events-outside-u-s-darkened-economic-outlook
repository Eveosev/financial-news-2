President  Barack Obama  said the
European debt crisis and disruptions caused by the tsnuami in
Japan are among the forces tht have “darkened the outlook” for
the  U.S. economy .  Obama also cited the “fiasco” of the extended debate over
raising the federal debt ceiling as harming growth. The
president is in Pittsburgh addressing a meeting of his council
on jobs and competitiveness, which is presenting recommendations
to spur hiring.  Among its recommendations is an initiative to attract $1
trillion in foreign direct investment within five years and
