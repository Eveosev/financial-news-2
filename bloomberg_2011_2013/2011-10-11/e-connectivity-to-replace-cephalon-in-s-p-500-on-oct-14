TE Connectivity Ltd. will replace
 Cephalon Inc. (CEPH)  in the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index after the close
of trading on Oct. 14, S&P said in a release today.  The change is being made because Cephalon is being acquired
by  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  in a deal expected to
close around that date, S&P said.  TE Connectivity, which is based in Schaffhausen,
 Switzerland , and manufactures automotive and aerospace products,
has a market value of $13.3 billion. Its shares have fallen 13
percent so far this year through the close of regular trading
today. The stock rose 6.8 percent to $32.78 as of 5:27 p.m. in
 New York  in after-hours trading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
