Japan will be prudent and monitor
global trends in overseeing its U.S. bond holdings, said  Seiji Maehara , policy chief for the ruling  Democratic Party  of Japan.  Japan needs to take balanced action as the world economy’s
interdependence is growing, Maehara told reporters at the World
Knowledge Forum held in Seoul today.  China and Japan are big holders of U.S. debt and Japan will
be prudent in its investment decisions, he said in Japanese
translated into Korean. China held $1.174 trillion of U.S.
Treasuries and Japan owned $915 billion as of July, according to
the U.S.  Treasury Department .  Maehara said he expects the U.S. will also cautiously
consider how to recover confidence in the dollar as the world’s
reserve currency given the severe difficulties facing the  U.S.
economy  and stock market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
