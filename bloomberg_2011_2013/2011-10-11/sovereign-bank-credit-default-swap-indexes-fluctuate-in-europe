The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and financial debt fluctuated, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments rose was unchanged at 322 basis points at 12:30 p.m.
in London. An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of
 credit quality ; a decline, the opposite.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased five basis points to 242 and the
subordinated index climbed eight to 488, reversing earlier
declines, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 10.5
basis points to 767. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings fell one basis point to
178.5 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
