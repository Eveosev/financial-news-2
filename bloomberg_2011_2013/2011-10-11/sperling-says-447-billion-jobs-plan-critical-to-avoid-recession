A Senate vote today on a $447
billion jobs package is crucial to heading off a potential
double-dip recession, a top economic adviser to President  Barack Obama  said.  “We’re sitting here looking at projections of 9 percent or
higher unemployment next year, we’re looking at projections of
weak growth, we’re looking at members of Congress willing to
take a risk of even having a double-dip recession and doing
nothing,”  Gene Sperling , head of the White House National
Economic Council, said on CNBC.  “This has overwhelmingly Democratic support,” Sperling
said of the jobs proposal. When asked if it would pass, he
responded, “You’re going to have to ask the Republicans.”  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, has
scheduled a test vote later today on the legislation, which
faces resistance from Republicans and some Democrats on its tax
and spending provisions. Sixty votes will be needed to move the
legislation forward; the Democrats control 53 seats in the
Senate.  Earlier today, Obama’s senior adviser,  David Plouffe , said
on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that if the jobs bill fails in
the Senate, “that would be a tragedy for the country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
