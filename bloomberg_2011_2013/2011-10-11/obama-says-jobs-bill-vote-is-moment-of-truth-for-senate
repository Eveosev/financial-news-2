President  Barack Obama  said the
Senate faces a “moment of truth” tonight in a procedural vote
on his $447 billion jobs plan.  “Today’s the day when every American will find out where
their senators stand on this jobs bill,” Obama said today in
remarks at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Local No. 5 Training Center in Pittsburgh.  Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, has
scheduled a test vote this evening on the legislation, which
faces resistance from Republicans and some Democrats on its tax
and spending provisions.  Obama said earlier Democrats may have to break up the
proposal and seek passage of individual provisions that can get
enough support in the House and Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
