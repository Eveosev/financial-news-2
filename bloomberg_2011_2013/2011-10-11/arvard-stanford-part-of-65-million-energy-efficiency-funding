     Oct. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Harvard University ,  Stanford
University  and Dartmouth College are among 33 schools that
raised more than $65 million for a revolving fund that will pay
for energy-efficiency upgrades at campus facilities.  Energy-efficiency projects reduce utility bills, generating
enough savings to pay for upgrades, according to an e-mailed
statement from the  Sustainable Endowments Institute , the
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based nonprofit group that organized
the Billion Dollar Green Challenge.  Under the Green Challenge, which will be introduced today,
the institute is calling on other colleges, universities and
nonprofit groups to invest as much as $1 billion in self-managed
funds to finance energy-efficiency projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
