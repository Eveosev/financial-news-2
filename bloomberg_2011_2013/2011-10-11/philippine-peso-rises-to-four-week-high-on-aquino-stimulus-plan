The Philippine peso rose to a four-
week high after the government announced an economic stimulus
plan to bolster flagging growth.  The currency appreciated for a fifth day after President
 Benigno Aquino  approved the fiscal package late yesterday, and
his spokesman Ricky Carandang said details will be announced
tomorrow. Government data today showed exports dropped 15.1
percent in August from a year earlier, the most since September
2009, and more than the 6.1 percent decline forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “The government hasn’t spent enough to boost growth and
businesses are looking forward to the stimulus,” said Marc Bautista, head of research in Manila at Metropolitan Bank &
Trust Co. “We still have large inflows from remittances, so a
stimulus should also support sentiment” on the peso, he said.  The currency advanced 0.5 percent to 43.183 per dollar as
of 10:17 a.m. in  Manila , and reached 43.180, the strongest level
since Sept. 14, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The peso has
gained 2.4 percent since hitting an eight-month low of 44.215 on
Oct. 4.  The Philippine government posted a  budget surplus  in August,
helping narrow the eight-month deficit to 34.5 billion pesos
($799 million), from 228.104 billion pesos in the same period in
2010. The full-year target is a shortfall of 300 billion pesos.
The  Philippines  may lower its economic growth estimates, Budget
Secretary Butch Abad said in a phone interview yesterday,
without elaborating.  Bonds Rise  The yield on the government’s 8 percent bonds maturing in
July 2031 dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to
6.88 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. The
price rose 1.27, or 127 pesos per 10,000 pesos face amount, to
111.988.  Dollar bonds also climbed. The yield on the 9.5 percent
securities due October 2024 fell six basis points to 5.08
percent, the lowest level since Sept. 21, according to prices
from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. The price increased 0.75,
or 75 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 141.75.  The government plans to buy back $1.5 billion of foreign-
currency bonds, including the 2024 notes, on Oct. 13 to manage
liabilities. About $17.5 billion of debt are eligible for tender,
Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima told reporters yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
