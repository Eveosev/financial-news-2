The U.K. government is to allow some
trucking companies to use longer trailers for a 10-year trial
period to boost freight capacity on Britain’s roads.  The Department of Transport will permit the use of 900
trailers with a maximum length of 15.65 meters (51.3 feet)
instead of the 13.6 meters currently allowed, it said in a
 statement on its website  in  London  today. Another 900 trailers
that are 1 meter longer than the current norm will also be
licensed. They won’t be allowed to exceed the 44 metric-ton
weight limit for trucks.  The longer vehicles will provide as much as 13 percent more
loading space, allowing fewer journeys to transport the same
amount of goods without compromising safety, the ministry said.
It said the measure would provide a 33 million-pound ($52
million) boost to the haulage industry.  “By allowing companies to use one truck where they may
have previously needed to send two, we can help the sector
improve efficiency and save money -- which should in turn
benefit consumers,” Roads Minister Mike Penning said in the
statement. “Independent research showed the potential
environmental, safety and congestion benefits of longer trailers
and this voluntary trial will give industry the opportunity to
demonstrate how this works in practice.”  Stobart Group Ltd. (STOB) , which operates more than 2,200 trucks,
welcomed the government announcement.  “We see considerable opportunities for the meter option
within our operations,” Chief Operating Officer William Stobart
said in an e-mailed statement  To contact the reporter on this story:
