Acciona SA (ANA)  completed construction of
a 56-megawatt wind park in Tuppadahalli,  India , making it the
biggest Spanish wind developer in the country.  The 58 million-euro ($79 million) facility, financed by
Chennai-based Infrastructure Development Finance Co., brings
Acciona’s total wind-generating capacity in India to 86
megawatts, Acciona said in an e-mailed press release.  The power from 34 1.65-megawatt turbines will be sold to
state-owned utility Mangalore Electricity Supply Co.  Acciona’s portfolio of projects in India has a load factor
of 37 percent compared with an average of 21 percent for wind
parks in the country, the company said, citing data from
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. All the plants are part of the
United Nations’ Clean Development Mechanism that issues carbon-
emission permits to projects in the developing world that reduce
greenhouse-gas emissions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
