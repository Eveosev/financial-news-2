Givaudan SA (GIVN) , the world’s largest
maker of flavors and fragrances, gained as much as 1.7 percent
in Zurich trading after pushing through price increases to
combat raw-material inflation.  The maker of the fragrance for  Marc Jacobs ’s Lola climbed
to as much as 758 Swiss francs and was trading up 1.4 percent at
755.5 francs as of 10:30 a.m. local time, even as  Switzerland ’s
benchmark SMI index dropped 0.5 percent.  Givaudan is sticking to its forecast that price increases
will mitigate half the impact of more expensive raw materials
this year and fully cover them next year, it said today. Third-
quarter sales gained 5.4 percent to 966 million francs ($1.07
billion) in local currencies, the Vernier, Switzerland-based
company said. Analysts predicted 983.8 million francs, though in
local currency, sales were broadly in line with estimates.  “The company has the power to raise prices,” Celine Pannuti, a London-based analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove, said in a
note to clients. “Pricing is likely to accelerate in the full
year 2012 as the company should continue to ramp up price
increases.” Pannuti rates Givaudan “overweight.”  Givaudan reiterated a mid-term forecast to expand at about
double the pace of the 2 percent to 3 percent growth expected
for the wider market. Expansion in  Asia  and  Latin America  is
part of Chief Executive Officer Gilles Andrier’s strategy to
generate half of sales in faster-growing emerging markets by
2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
