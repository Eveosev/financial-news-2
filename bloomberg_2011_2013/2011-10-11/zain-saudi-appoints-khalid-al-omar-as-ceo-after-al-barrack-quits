Zain  Saudi Arabia , a unit of Mobile
Telecommunications Co. of  Kuwait , appointed Khalid Al-Omar as
chief executive officer after Saad al-Barrak resigned.  The board of directors accepted the resignation of al-
Barrak as a board member, managing director and chief executive
officer, the company said in a statement to the  Saudi bourse 
today.  Al-Omar will take over as the Riyadh-based mobile telephone
operator’s “managing director and chief executive officer until
the upcoming general meeting," according to the statement. The
shareholders will consider appointing Bader Nasser al-Kharafi as
a successor to al-Barrak, it said without specifying in which
role.  Zain Saudi’s parent company Zain Group last month failed to
sell a 25 percent stake in its Saudi unit to Kingdom Holding Co.
and Bahrain Telecommunications Co. The deal fell through becuase
lenders refused to transfer debt guarantees from Zain to
purchasers, Al Watan newspaper reported on Oct. 4, citing Zain
Saudi’s Chairman Prince Hussam al-Saud.  The shares closed 1.7 percent lower at 5.95 riyals in
 Riyadh  today. The stock has tumbled 23 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
