A measure of how much European banks
pay to fund in dollars declined to the lowest in more than three
weeks as lawmakers in Slovakia vote on the euro area’s enhanced
bailout fund.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks pay
to convert euro payments into dollars, fell to 66 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate as of 4:39 p.m. in  London ,
from 67.5 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the smallest gap since Sept. 16.  Slovakia’s approval of the revamped European Financial
Stability Facility is needed to enact the plan to prevent
contagion from the debt crisis that has spread from  Greece .
 European Central Bank  President  Jean-Claude Trichet  warned today
that the sovereign crisis has reached a “systemic dimension.”  There is “hope that we are just weeks away from a having
comprehensive strategy to recapitalise the banks and restore
confidence in Europe,” Colin Tan, a credit analyst at Deutsche
Bank AG in Sydney wrote in a note.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap fell to 93 basis
points under Euribor, compared with 95 yesterday. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps was 71 basis points, compared with 89 basis points on
Sept. 23 when the rate was the widest since March 2009.  ECB Deposits  Overnight deposits at the European Central Bank increased to
the highest in more than a year. Banks parked 269 billion euros
($367 billion) at the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from 256
billion euros on Oct. 7. That’s the highest since June 2010 and
compares with a year-to-date average of 58 billion euros.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.570 percent from 1.567
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor rose to 1.191 percent from
1.185 percent.  The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 23rd day to 0.398 percent from 0.394 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 10, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, rose to 39.2
basis points from 39.8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
