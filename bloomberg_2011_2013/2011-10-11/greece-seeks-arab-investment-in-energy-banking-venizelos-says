Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the country will in coming days issue a call for
tenders to develop the Hellenikon airport site on the outskirts
of  Athens .  Venizelos said there were opportunities for Arab investment
in energy, renewable energy as well as banking since Greek banks
were part of the European banking system and stable and secure.
He said Greeceâ€™s plans to sell stakes in  Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE) 
and Depa, the national gas company, could draw Arab investment
and build ties between Greece and the Arab world. He spoke in
Athens today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
