Aker Solutions ASA (AKSO) ,  Norway ’s biggest
oil platform maker, fell the most in two months in Oslo trading
after announcing additional costs from delays to deliveries of
subsea systems to  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  in Brazil.  The company will book extra costs of 400 million kroner
($70 million) to 500 million kroner in the third quarter, the
Oslo-based company said today in a statement.  The shares fell as much as 10.2 percent, the most since
Aug. 12, and were down 9 percent at 54.2 kroner as of 5:08 p.m.
local time.  The company said delivery schedules for all major subsea
production systems on order from Petrobras are “substantially”
delayed in part because of “prolonged execution time” and
measures to improve quality. The company’s second-quarter profit
dropped 70 percent partly due to delays in  Brazil .  “Our performance is hampered by high activity in Brazil,”
Oeyvind Eriksen, executive chairman of  Aker Solutions , said in
the statement. “Suppliers to the oil industry in the region are
facing lack of resources. But parts of the reason for our delays
are also very specific to Aker Solutions and our manufacturing
site in Curitiba.”  A review will be done during October to verify the cost
estimates and to ensure all risks and opportunities for
improvement have been “fully quantified,” Aker Solutions said.
The company will give a further update on Nov. 3, when it
presents its third quarter results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
