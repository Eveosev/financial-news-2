Israeli  government bonds  fell for a
fourth day pushing yields to a two-week high on speculation the
central bank will hold rates this month as the economy is
estimated to expand 4.9 percent this year.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit bond due
January 2022 rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 4.66 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, matching the
level on Sept. 27. Two-year  interest-rate  swaps, an indicator of
investor expectations for rates over the period, jumped seven
basis points to 2.77 percent.  The economy will probably expand 4.9 percent this year,
from 4.8 percent in 2010, the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said today. The estimate outpaces most advanced
economies, which are forecast by the  International Monetary Fund 
to grow an average 1.6 percent. The Bank of  Israel  will leave
the rate at 3 percent this month according to 13 of 16
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “As long as growth remains robust in the 5 percent range,
it will be harder for the  Bank of Israel  to cut rates,” Terence Klingman, the head of research at Meitav Brokerage in Tel Aviv
said by telephone. “Much depends on what happens in  Europe  and
how this will affect the Israeli economy.”  Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer lowered the
benchmark interest rate for the first time in 2 1/2 years on
Sept. 26, citing the worsening global outlook. Three of the 16
economists surveyed expect another 25 basis-point cut this
month.  Slowing Inflation  European Union and International Monetary Fund officials
indicated today  Greece  will get an 8 billion-euro ($11 billion)
loan next month under a 110 billion-euro bailout. European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  warned of threats to
the financial system as the conflict among political leaders
intensified over how to extricate Europe from the debt crisis.  Second-quarter growth was 3.7 percent compared with a
previous estimate of 3.5 percent, the statistics office said
today. Investment in fixed capital will drive 2011 growth, it
said  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the period, dropped three basis
points to 173, implying annual inflation of 1.73 percent. The
yield on inflation-linked bonds due June 2013 rose less than one
basis point to 1.15 percent.  Inflation likely eased in September as food costs declined
following consumer protests and as end-of-summer sales brought
down apparel prices. Annual inflation slowed to 3.2 percent from
3.4 percent, according to the median estimate of 17 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The statistics bureau is scheduled to
release the data Oct. 14.  The shekel strengthened for a second day, gaining 0.3
percent to 3.6815 per dollar at 4:50 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The Tel-
Bond 40 index of corporate bonds climbed 0.4 percent.  Israeli markets will be closed until Oct. 16 for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
