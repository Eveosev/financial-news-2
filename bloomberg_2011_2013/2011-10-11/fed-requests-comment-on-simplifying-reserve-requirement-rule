The  Federal Reserve  requested
comment today on proposed rules that would simplify so-called
Regulation D, a rule focused on reserve requirements for banks.  The proposals are “intended to simplify the administration
of reserve requirements and reduce administrative and
operational costs for both  depository institutions  and Reserve
Banks,” the Fed said today in a statement in Washington.  The rules would create a common two-week maintenance period
for all depository institutions, set up a “penalty-free band”
around reserve balance requirements and eliminate the
contractual clearing balance program. The Fed is seeking comment
within 60 days of the proposed rule’s publication in the Federal
Register.  To contact the reporter on this story:
