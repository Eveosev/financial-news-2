Manssor Arbabsiar, one of two men
accused of plotting to kill  Saudi Arabia ’s ambassador to the
U.S., was ordered held without bail after his initial court
appearance in Manhattan federal court.  Arbabsiar, 56, will plead not guilty, his court-appointed
lawyer, Sabrina Shroff said after court.  Magistrate Judge Michael Dolinger ordered Arbabsiar held in
U.S. custody and approved Shroff’s request that her client
receive medical attention.  The Justice Department earlier today accused  Iran  of
sponsoring a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in a
conspiracy involving a secret Iranian military unit and a
citizen of the Islamic Republic with a U.S. passport.  Arbabsiar and Gholam Shakuri were charged with
conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, in this case
plastic explosives, to murder Ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir and
attack Saudi installations in the U.S. in a plan hatched this
year. Targets included “foreign government facilities
associated with Saudi Arabia and with another country,” the
U.S. said in a criminal complaint.  While Shakuri remains at large, Arbabsiar was arrested
Sept. 29 at  New York ’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.  If convicted of all charges, Arbabsiar faces as long as
life in prison.  To contact the reporters on this story:
