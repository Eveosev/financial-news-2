New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
today endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney,
saying he will be the best person to lead the country.  “America cannot survive another four years of Barack
Obama,” Christie said at a joint news conference with Romney in
Lebanon, New Hampshire.  Christie, who last week anounced he wouldn’t run in the
2012 presidential race, cited Romney’s experience as a former
governor of  Massachusetts  and as a venture capitalist. Romney is
“an executive who has used executive power,” Christie said.
The endorsement was “an easy decision for me,” he said.  Romney and seven presidential rivals will square off in a
debate tonight on the economy and jobs. The event starts at 8
p.m. at  Dartmouth College  in Hanover, and is sponsored by
Bloomberg News and the Washington Post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
