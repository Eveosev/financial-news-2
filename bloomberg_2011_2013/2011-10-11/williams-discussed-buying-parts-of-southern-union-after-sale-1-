Williams Cos. asked  Energy Transfer
Equity LP (ETE)  if it would sell some of  Southern Union Co. (SUG) ’s
pipelines after Energy Transfer buys Southern Union later this
year.  Williams Chief Executive Officer Alan Armstrong e-mailed
Energy Transfer CEO Kelcy Warren on Sept. 2, asking if the
companies could discuss some of Southern Union’s assets.
Williams was interested in Southern Union’s Citrus Corp.
subsidiary, which owns 50 percent of the Florida Gas
Transmission Co., along with the Trunkline system that runs from
the  Gulf of Mexico  to  Michigan , and the Panhandle system that
runs from Texas and Oklahoma to the Midwest, according to a
filing from Energy Transfer today.  The Southern Union board agreed to allow the discussions on
Sept. 5. The two companies ended the talks Oct. 9 after they
were “unable to reach an agreement,” the filing said.  Williams and Energy Transfer have been competing to buy
Houston-based Southern Union since June. Energy Transfer has
increased its offer twice to outbid Williams, most recently to
$5.1 billion. A date for a shareholder vote has not been
released. The transaction would be the largest purchase of a
pipeline company in the U.S. this year, according to Bloomberg
data.  Jeff Pounds, a spokesman for Williams in Tulsa,  Oklahoma ,
said the company would not comment. Vicki Anderson Granado, a
spokeswoman for Dallas-based Energy Transfer, said the company
would not comment beyond the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
