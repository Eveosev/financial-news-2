European Central Bank Governing
Council member Yves Mersch said some financial-market segments
lack liquidity to operate smoothly.  European finance ministers “are very keen to regulate OTC
derivatives, to forbid naked short selling and so on,” Mersch
said in a speech in Luxembourg today. “One element I would
recommend ministers ought not to forget is that some of these
programs provide to markets the necessary depths and
liquidity.”  “It’s exactly what is lacking in financial products,”
Mersch said. “We do not have the profoundness, the depths and
the liquidity that is needed in the markets in order for those
markets to perform smoothly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
