U.S. Army Lieutenant General Robert
Lennox said the Army’s share of planned defense spending cuts
may translate to between $12 billion and $14 billion a year.  Overall defense spending is projected to decrease some $450
billion over the next decade. That means the proposed cuts to
the Army’s share of the budget will “come to the neighborhood”
of between $12 billion and $14 billion a year, said Lennox,
appearing on a panel at the annual conference of the Association
of the U.S. Army in  Washington .  The Army already plans to shrink the number of active-duty
soldiers to about 520,000 from about 570,0000 today. Because the
size of the force can’t be reduced quickly enough to offset
spending reductions, “the brunt of those cuts will come in
modernization and training,” said Lennox, deputy chief of staff
for weapons programs. “It’s just math.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
