A strike by customs workers in
 Kuwait , OPEC’s fifth-largest oil producer, may reduce available
cargoes for the largest crude tankers, according to shipbroker
and consulting firm Lorentzen & Stemoco AS.  About six tankers were prevented from leaving Kuwaiti ports
yesterday as customs employees seeking higher salaries began
industrial action, Fahad al-Ajmi, a union board member, said by
phone today.  “If the strike persists through the week and beyond, there
will be fewer very large crude carrier cargoes,” Thomas Zwick,
an analyst at Lorentzen in Oslo, said by e-mail today.  Kuwaiti crude exports total about 2.5 million barrels a
day, more than enough to fill one VLCC, and the “current strike
could therefore adversely affect this market,” said Zwick.
Daily returns for VLCCs hauling Middle East oil to  Asia 
strengthened today to minus $5,041, according to the London-
based  Baltic Exchange , which assesses freight rates on
international routes.  Global oil-tanker demand will advance 4.9 percent this year
to 144.6 million deadweight tons, according to Clarkson Research
Services Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest shipbroker. That’s
less than its projected 8.1 percent expansion of the fleet to
173.1 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
