The following table is a historical
summary of Bank  Indonesia ’s monetary policy decisions.  The central bank targets the  Bank Indonesia  rate which is 
used as a reference for bill sales and was introduced in
July 2005.    Since Bloomberg started surveys for Bank Indonesia’s 
reference rate in December of 2005, there have been a total
of 71 rate decisions by the bank, of which 11 were unexpected,
resulting in the survey matching the actual rate decision 84.5%
of the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
