The head of  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  said
the world has altered “dramatically” for the lender after the
“painful” discovery published yesterday that it had to clean
up its balance sheet and announce a loss for this year.  “For us, the world has changed dramatically and we have
learnt something very painfully,” Chief Executive Officer
Andreas Treichl told European Union lawmakers discussing new
banking rules in Brussels today. “We have lent too much to many
people and to many governments who cannot afford to take on so
much money.”  Erste, eastern Europe’s second-biggest lender, said
yesterday that it expects to post a full-year loss of as much as
800 million euros ($1.1 billion) because of writedowns and
provisions totaling 1.6 billion euros. It won’t pay a dividend
for 2011 and shelved for at least a year a plan to repay 1.2
billion euros of aid from the Austrian government.  “We have decided as a little savings bank in central
 Europe  that we have spent too much money on a bank in  Romania ,
that we have given too many Swiss franc mortgage loans to
clients in  Hungary , that it was a mistake to lend money to
governments by the way of credit default swaps,” he said. “We
cleaned it up in one go yesterday, and I tell you it was painful
-- but I feel a lot better today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
