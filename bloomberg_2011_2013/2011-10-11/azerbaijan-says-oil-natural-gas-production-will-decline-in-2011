Azerbaijan â€™s oil and natural gas
output will decline in 2011 from a year earlier, the  Finance
Ministry  said in a report on its website today.  Oil production will slum 10 percent to 45.6 million metric
tons and gas output will decline 3.4 percent to 25.3 billion
cubic meters, the ministry said without giving a reason for the
decline.  The State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, also known as Socar, had
earlier attributed the fall in oil output to increased safety
measures at the BP Plc-operated Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field
following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  The Finance Ministry also said that 2012 gas production
will grow 12 percent to 28.3 billion cubic meters, while oil
output will almost stay flat with 46 million tons next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
