Czech Property Investments AS will
sell corporate and project bonds in the first half of next year,
and will apply for a  credit rating  by year-end.  The bonds will be sold to retail and institutional
investors. The sale is part of an overall bond-sale plan valued
at 250 million euros ($340 million) to 300 million euros, Chief
Executive Officer Zdenek Havelka said at a press conference in
Prague today. The first tranche of three to five-year bonds may
be issued in May, after CPI’s full-year results, the CEO said.  “We’re evaluating different ways of selling the notes
including a retail sale,” Havelka said. “We hear from lenders
that demand from retail investors is on a rise so at the end the
retail may present a significant part.”  CPI expects to acquire assets worth 18 billion koruna ($989
million) this year, bringing the total value of its assets to 55
billion koruna by the end of 2011, it said today.  The company’s total debt may total to 25 to 27 billion
koruna by the end of the year, Havelka said. The debt ratio to
capital is “very good” and low leverage is a reason why CPI
plans to issue bonds, Havelka said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
