Billionaire investor  George Soros 
and 100 supporters, including politicians, managers and
economists, called for immediate measures to solve the European
debt crisis,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing a letter to the heads
of the 17-nation currency bloc.  The signatories, among them former German Foreign Minister
 Joschka Fischer , former German Finance Minister Hans Eichel,
Emma Bonino, an Italian former minister for European Affairs,
and Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European Studies at
Oxford University, wrote that national solutions for the debt
crisis would inevitably lead to an European collapse, the
newspaper said. Current measures are coming too late, are not
sufficient and may trigger global tensions on financial markets,
Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
