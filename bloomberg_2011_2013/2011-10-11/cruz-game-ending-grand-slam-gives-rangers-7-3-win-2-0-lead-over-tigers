The  Texas Rangers  took a 2-0 lead
against the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship
Series as Nelson Cruz hit the first game-ending grand slam in
postseason history to secure a 7-3 win in 11 innings.  “The fans got me excited,” Cruz said in a televised
interview. “We battled the whole game. The bullpen did a really
good job. My teammates never gave up.”  Cruz, who hit a leadoff home run in the seventh inning to
tie the game 3-3, sealed the win with no outs in the 11th off
Ryan Perry, who came in to start the inning, giving up three
singles before Cruz’s homer.  Mike Adams, the sixth  Texas  pitcher, went one inning for
the win at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas.  The best-of-seven Major League Baseball series now moves to
Detroit’s Comerica Park for as many as three games and will
return to Texas if necessary for Games 6 and 7 on Oct. 15 and 16.  The winner moves on to the  World Series  against the
Milwaukee Brewers or the  St. Louis Cardinals . The second game of
the National League Championship Series is tonight in Milwaukee,
with the Brewers trying to take a 2-0 series lead.  Ryan Raburn accounted for all of Detroit’s runs with a
three-run homer off Texas starter Derek Holland in the third
inning. Five Texas relievers held the Tigers scoreless for 8 1/3
innings.  Texas took the lead in the first inning on run-scoring
doubles by  Josh Hamilton  and Adrian Beltre off Detroit starter
Max Scherzer, who allowed three runs on six hits and struck out
six in six innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
