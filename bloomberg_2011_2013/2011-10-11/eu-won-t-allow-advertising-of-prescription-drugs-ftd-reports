The European Union said
pharmaceutical companies remain prohibited from advertising
 prescription drugs , the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
citing an unpublished draft law.  Companies such as Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH or Bayer AG
will be allowed to give more information to patients at their
request, though advertising of products for treating asthma or
diabetes on television or radio, or in print media, remains
prohibited, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
