The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment fell,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 14 basis points to 211.5 basis
points as of 8:40 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. That’s on track for the lowest level
since Sept. 21, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 12 basis points to
197 as of 11:18 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. A close of 197 would be the lowest since Sept. 21,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 10 basis points to 202.5
as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. That’s on
track for its lowest close since Sept. 30, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
