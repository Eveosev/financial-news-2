Fletcher Building Ltd. (FBU)  slumped the
most in almost 14 years after  New Zealand ’s largest construction
company said first-half profit is likely to fall 10 percent from
a year earlier because of weak residential
and commercial markets in New Zealand and  Australia .  “In New Zealand, no material improvement in trading
conditions is expected in the first half and the timing of a
sustained and meaningful recovery beyond that is uncertain,”
the Auckland-based company said in a statement. “In Australia,
there is a clear risk that residential and commercial
construction activity will remain around the current low level
for the balance of the 2012 year.”  Fletcher shares tumbled 98 cents, or 12 percent, to NZ$6.92
at the 5 p.m. close, extending its loss the past six months to
26 percent. It was the biggest fall since Oct. 28, 1997. The
benchmark NZX 50 index fell 2.1 percent.  Recent increases in building approvals are yet to flow
through to housing starts, while there is a delay to
reconstruction of Christchurch where earthquakes the past year
have wrecked homes, shops and office blocks, the nation’s
largest supplier of wall board, timber and cement, said  Net income in the six months ending Dec. 31 is likely to be
less than the NZ$166 million ($130 million) in the year-earlier
period, Fletcher said.  Still, full-year profit excluding unusual items is expected
to be similar to NZ$359 million in the 12 months ended June 30,
2011, reflecting the inclusion of Crane Group which was acquired
earlier this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
