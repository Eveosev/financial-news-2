Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) ’s planned
long-haul budget unit may have four planes in service next year
as it targets flights to Australia,  China  and Europe.  The fleet may jump to 14  Boeing Co. (BA)  777-200s by the end of
2016, according to tender documents for the yet-to-be named
carrier on Singapore’s Air website. The budget unit will have
about 400 seats on each 777, compared with the 323 fitted in the
two-class 777-200s operated by Singapore Air’s mainline unit.  The new Singapore-based airline will operate a “no-frills
model” with low fares and customers paying extra for services
such as entertainment, according to the tender briefs. Singapore
Air, the world’s second-largest carrier by market value, is
creating the new unit as it loses leisure travelers at its home
airport to AirAsia X Sdn. and  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) ’s Jetstar.  Audrey Tan, a spokeswoman for the budget unit, said the
airline is yet to make any final decisions on its fleet or
timing of its first flight. Campbell Wilson, a 15-year Singapore
Air veteran, is leading the discount carrier, which is being run
as a separately managed unit.  The tender documents were for in-flight entertainment and
wireless connections for the new carrier, which is currently
named New Aviation Pte.  In addition to its namesake brand, Singapore Airlines also
owns regional carrier Silk Air and has agreed to increase its
stake in short-haul budget carrier  Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd. (TGR) 
to about 49 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
