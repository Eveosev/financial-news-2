Atlantic City  casino gambling
revenue fell 0.6 percent in September as competition from
casinos and slots in neighboring states continued to attract
gamblers.  Betting returns shrank to $294.7 million from a year
earlier,  New Jersey â€™s Division of Gaming Enforcement said today
on its  website . Slot machine revenue at the 11 casinos declined
1.9 percent and table game winnings rose 2.7 percent.  New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie  this year offered
greater state assistance in return for overhauled regulations to
help limit losses in Atlantic City. He created a state-run
tourism district in the area encompassing the casinos and the
Boardwalk and redirected gaming tax revenue to improve the city.  Gambling in the second-biggest U.S. casino market after  Las
Vegas  fell to $3.57 billion in 2010 from a peak of $5.2 billion
in 2006.  For the nine months through September, revenue in Atlantic
City slid 7.8 percent to $2.6 billion from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
