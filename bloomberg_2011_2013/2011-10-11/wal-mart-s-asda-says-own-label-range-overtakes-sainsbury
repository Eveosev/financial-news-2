Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s Asda chain
has overtaken  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  in the U.K. market for own-label
products, Chief Executive Officer Andy Clarke said today.  “For the first time in our history, our private-label
market share is ahead” of Sainsbury, the executive said in a
speech at the IGD conference in London. “And we’re only building
on that momentum.”  The grocer revamped its mid-tier priced “Chosen By You”
range last year, after 4,000 items including ready-made meals
were tested by consumers before they reached shelves. The line
is now the fastest-growing own-label range in the U.K., Clarke
said. Asda’s private-label products also include the higher-
priced “Extra Special” line and value-orientated “Smart Price”
range.  The retailer hasn’t changed its strategy since Tesco’s Big
Price Drop campaign, Clarke said.  “We are still very committed to Asda price guarantee,”
through which the grocer promises to be 10 percent cheaper than
rivals, he said. “We’re going to continue to invest in price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
