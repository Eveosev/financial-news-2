Iran  and Iraq have set up a joint
“security committee” to fight the rebel Party for a Free Life
in Kurdistan or PJAK, the state-run  Fars  news agency reported,
citing the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.  The two countries will cooperate to counter PJAK “and its
forces on Iraq’s northern borders,” according to a statement by
Maliki’s office today, Fars said without giving details of what
measures will be taken.  Members of PJAK regularly clash with Iranian security
forces along the country’s north-western border. The group seeks
autonomy for Iran’s Kurdish areas and is affiliated with the
Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, which has origins in  Turkey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
