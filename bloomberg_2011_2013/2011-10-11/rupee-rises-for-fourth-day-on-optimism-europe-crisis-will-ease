India ’s rupee fell the most in more
than two weeks as renewed concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
worsening prompted investors to favor the dollar’s relative
safety over emerging-market assets.  The currency retreated from this month’s strongest level of
48.8675 per dollar, reached earlier today, after European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the region’s
debt crisis now threatens the financial system. The rupee also
declined on speculation some domestic banks bought the
greenback, said J. Moses Harding, executive vice president at
IndusInd Bank Ltd.  “The underlying trend is bearish given the European
concerns and we see tremendous demand for dollars when the
rupee” strengthens past 49, Mumbai-based Harding said.  The rupee weakened 0.7 percent to 49.3275 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 49.97 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 49.55 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
