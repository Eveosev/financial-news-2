European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet rebuffed criticism that the bank is printing
money as it buys  government bonds  from distressed euro region
countries.  “This criticism is completely inaccurate,” Trichet said
in an interview with Germany’s Welt newspaper to be published
tomorrow. “We are fiercely independent of governments and
pressure groups. We are totally devoted to our primary Treaty
mandate of  price stability ,” he said, according to a transcript
provided by the ECB.  Trichet reiterated his call to fully implement the
decisions taken by European leaders on July 21 to shield the 17-
nation currency bloc against further market tensions. The ECB
considers it not “appropriate” to grant the European Financial
Stability Facility a bank license and governments should
“provide appropriate leveraging of the fund,” Trichet said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
