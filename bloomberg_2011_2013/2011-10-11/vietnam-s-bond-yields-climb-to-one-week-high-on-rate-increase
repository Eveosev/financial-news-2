Vietnam’s five-year bonds dropped
for a second day, pushing the yields to the highest level in
more than a week, after the central bank increased a benchmark
 interest rate  for the first time since May. The dong fell.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam raised on Oct. 7 its refinancing
rate to 15 percent from 14 percent with effect from yesterday to
slow Asia’s fastest inflation. Consumer prices rose 22.4 percent
last month from a year earlier, official data show.  “Yields on  government bonds  go up with interest rates,”
said Luu Hai Yen, Hanoi-based fixed income analyst at Thang Long
Securities Joint-Stock Co.  Yields on five-year government debt rose one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.42 percent, the highest level
since Sept. 29, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  The dong dropped 0.1 percent to 20,868 per dollar as of
4:35 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vietnam ’s central bank weakened the dong-dollar reference
rate today for the fourth time this month, fixing it at 20,668
per dollar from 20,653 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the official rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
