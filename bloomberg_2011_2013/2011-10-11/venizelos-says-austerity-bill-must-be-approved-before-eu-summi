Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said a law on new pension and wage cuts and layoffs
for state workers must be approved by Parliament before a summit
of European Union leaders on Oct. 23.  “Voting through this law will shield the country,”
Venizelos told lawmakers at the first discussion of the law at a
committee hearing in  Athens  today. He said a final vote on the
law would be held some time next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
