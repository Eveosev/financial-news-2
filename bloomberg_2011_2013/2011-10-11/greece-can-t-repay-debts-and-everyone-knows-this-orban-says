The euro area may be engulfed in a
crisis in the next two months similar to the one the U.S. faced
in 2008, Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said.  “There is a serious risk the October 2008 U.S. financial
crisis will be repeated in the euro area this fall,” Orban said
in a speech in Parliament today. “It’s obvious that the
European banking system needs to be fully recapitalized.”  European leaders yesterday pushed back a crisis summit on
dealing with Greece’s debt woes and shielding banks from the
fallout amid German plans for a deeper-than-planned writedowns
of Greek bonds. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed the largest
bankruptcy in U.S. history on Sept. 15, 2008, triggering
economic turmoil that thrust the U.S. and the euro area into
recessions and forced countries including Hungary to obtain
bailouts to avert defaults.  “Everyone knows that  Greece ’s debts can’t be repaid,
though it’s not customary to speak as harshly about this as I
just did,” Orban said.  European leaders delayed their Oct. 18 meeting until Oct.
23.  Europe  needs a strategy for shoring up banks before
unstitching a July accord to cut Greek bond values by an average
of 21 percent, Belgian Prime Minister  Yves Leterme  said
yesterday. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker
yesterday said the writedowns may exceed 60 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
