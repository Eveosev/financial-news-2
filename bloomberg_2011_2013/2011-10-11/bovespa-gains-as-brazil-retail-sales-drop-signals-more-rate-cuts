The Bovespa stock index climbed to a
two-week high as homebuilders and consumer stocks gained after
 Brazil  retail sales declined more than forecast, signaling the
central bank may continue to cut  interest rates .  Consumer goods company Hypermarcas SA led gains by stocks
that depend on domestic demand. PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos &
Participacoes, Brazil’s biggest homebuilder by revenue, reached
its highest price in three weeks. OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA rose after Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista 
increased his stake to 62.5 percent from 61 percent, according
to the oil company’s press office.  The Bovespa rose 1.1 percent to 53,838.47 at the close of
trading. Forty-one stocks gained on the index, while 24 fell.
The real weakened 0.1 percent to 1.7645 per  U.S. dollar .  “Retail sales were lower than expected,” Marcio Cardoso,
a partner at Titulo Corretora de Valores, said in a telephone
interview from  Sao Paulo . “The central bank is trying to avoid
a steep economic slowdown, so it’ll probably keep cutting
interest rates. But volatility will remain high until the crisis
in Europe is solved.”  Retail sales in Brazil fell 0.4 percent in August from a
month earlier, the national statistics agency said in  Rio de
Janeiro . Sales were forecast to decline 0.1 percent, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 34 economists.
Sales rose 6.2 percent from a year ago, trailing a median
estimate of 6.9 percent.  Yields on most Brazilian interest-rate futures contracts
fell after the report was released. Yields on the contract due
in January 2013, the most traded today in Sao Paulo, declined
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.46 percent.  Hypermarcas, OGX  Hypermarcas advanced 2.9 percent to 8.39 reais. PDG Realty
jumped 3.7 percent to 6.79 reais, the highest since Sept. 19.
OGX rose 3.1 percent to 12.29 reais.  The Bovespa earlier fell as much as 0.9 percent, swinging
between gains and losses at least nine times during the first 90
minutes of trading, after European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet warned of threats to the financial system as the
conflict among political leaders intensified over how to
extricate  Europe  from the debt crisis.  The Bovespa entered a  bear market  in July after plunging 20
percent from its 2010 bull-market peak. The measure has since
extended that drop to 26 percent and trades at 8.9 times
analysts’ earnings estimates, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That compares to a ratio of 9.5 for MSCI Inc.’s gauge of
21 developing nations’ equities.  Traders moved 6.34 billion reais ($3.6 billion) in stocks
in Sao Paulo today, compared with a daily average this year of
6.3 billion reais, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
