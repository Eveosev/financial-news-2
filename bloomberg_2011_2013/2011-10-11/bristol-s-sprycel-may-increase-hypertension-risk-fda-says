Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) ’s leukemia
drug Sprycel may increase the risk of a rare condition that
causes high  blood pressure  in the lungs’ arteries, U.S.
regulators said today.  Health-care providers should evaluate patients for signs of
underlying cardiopulmonary disease before starting Sprycel,
chemically known as dasatinib, and during treatment. If
abnormally high blood pressure known as pulmonary arterial
hypertension is confirmed, patients should discontinue the
medicine, according to the safety  announcement  from the  Food and
Drug Administration.   Twelve cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension tied to
Sprycel were confirmed from New York-based Bristol’s
pharmacovigilance database. No fatalities have been reported.
High blood pressure can cause the heart to work harder and
eventually become weak and lose its ability to pump enough blood
through the lungs, the FDA said.  “Patients with PAH during Sprycel treatment were often
taking other medications at the same time or had other co-
existing medical conditions,” FDA said.  The agency estimated that 32,882 patients worldwide have
taken Sprycel for Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic
myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The drug was
approved in June 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
