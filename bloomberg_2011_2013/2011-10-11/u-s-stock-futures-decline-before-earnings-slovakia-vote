Most U.S. stocks advanced, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index posted its smallest move since
August, as optimism about third-quarter corporate earnings
overshadowed concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, rose 2.1
percent ahead of its results.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  added at least 1.4 percent to pace gains
among companies most-tied to the economy.  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  jumped 4.3
percent as Credit Suisse Group AG said valuations for fertilizer
shares are attractive.  AMR Corp. (AMR)  rose 7.1 percent as  American
Airlines  joined its bigger U.S. peers with deeper seating cuts.  Almost seven stocks rose for every five that fell on U.S.
exchanges at 4 p.m. New York time. The S&P 500 added 0.1 percent
to 1,195.54. The benchmark gauge traded within a 1 percent range
between its high and low level for the day, the narrowest since
July 26. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated 16.88
points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,416.30 today.  “The markets have shrugged off some of the pessimism,”
Peter Tuz, who helps manage about $800 million as president of
Chase Investment Counsel Corp. in Charlottesville,  Virginia ,
said in a telephone interview. “We’re seeing a recovery in
groups that have really taken it on the chin. Only time will
tell if earnings won’t be quite as bad as we all feared.”  The  S&P 500  has fallen as much as 19 percent from its
three-year high in April through Aug. 3, on a closing basis,
amid concern about Europe’s debt crisis. Gauges of financial,
commodity and industrial shares in the index slumped more than
26 percent during that period. The S&P 500 last week rose from
the threshold of a  bear market , and yesterday rallied 3.4
percent, on optimism Europe will tame its crisis.  Earnings Season  Earnings per share for the S&P 500, excluding financial
companies, rose 14 percent in the third quarter, according to
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Still, it’s the
smallest gain since the end of 2009, the data showed.  Alcoa, the first company of the Dow to report results for
the third quarter, climbed 2.1 percent to $10.30 in regular
trading. The shares tumbled 4.8 percent to $9.81 at 5:08 p.m.,
after the earnings were released. The largest U.S. smelter of
aluminum reported third-quarter profit that trailed analysts’
estimates as production costs increased.  Excluding restructuring costs, earnings were about 14 cents
a share, New York-based Alcoa said in a statement. The average
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 22 cents.
Sales increased 21 percent to $6.4 billion. The average of nine
analysts’ estimates was for $6.23 billion.  Economic Outlook  Aluminum for immediate delivery on the London Metal
Exchange has declined 11 percent in 2011, erasing earlier gains,
amid concerns about the economic outlook in the U.S. and  Europe ,
hampering Alcoa’s efforts to boost earnings.  Benchmark gauges fell earlier today after European Central
Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the debt crisis
threatens the financial system. S&P said it no longer sees 2012
as a “turnaround year” for Spanish banks and the rating
company expects problematic assets to “continue accumulating
during 2012 and potentially into the first months of early
2013.”  After the close of regular U.S. trading, Slovak lawmakers
failed to approve an overhaul of Europe’s bailout fund, toppling
the government. Smer, the largest opposition party, which didn’t
back the legislation today, will support the changes in a second
vote, ensuring it will pass, party leader  Robert Fico  told
reporters in the capital Bratislava. Slovakia is the only
country in the 17-nation euro area that hasn’t ratified the
measures.  ‘ Systemic Risk ’  “The key overhang is the systemic risk,” Eric Teal, chief
investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares Inc., which
manages $4 billion in Raleigh,  North Carolina , said in a
telephone interview. “Given the shock that occurred in 2008,
investors are focused on capital preservation as opposed to
identifying opportunities. Some relief might unfold as we head
into earnings season.”  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth added 1 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average, a proxy for the economy, gained 0.7 percent. The KBW
Bank Index rose 0.6 percent. Apple increased 3 percent to
$400.29. Bank of America climbed 1.4 percent to $6.37.
Caterpillar jumped 1.9 percent to $80.66.  Fertilizer producers advanced after Credit Suisse said the
industry’s valuations “look highly compelling.” Mosaic added
4.3 percent to $55.77.  CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF)  climbed 4.6
percent to $146.81.  AMR Surges  The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index of 10 stocks gained 2.8
percent. AMR surged 7.1 percent to $2.71. The fourth-quarter
capacity reduction of 3 percent means that 2011 costs for flying
each seat a mile will increase “modestly” beyond the forecast
of as much as 10.1 percent provided on Sept. 21, Fort Worth,
Texas-based American said yesterday in a statement.  Companies in the S&P 500 least-tied to economic growth
retreated. Gauges of utility and telephone providers in the
benchmark gauge lost at least 1 percent.  Solar shares tumbled after Raymond James Financial Inc. cut
estimates for the group, citing “drastically” reduced pricing
and margin assumptions.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  fell 6.5 percent, the
most in the S&P 500, to $55.91.  SunPower Corp. (SPWRA)  slid 2.5 percent
to $8.24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
