Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  wants to pass amnesties on unpaid taxes and fines for
illegal construction to revive the economy and gain voters’
support, la Repubblica reported, citing an unidentified member
of his party.  Tax and property amnesties may help Berlusconi’s People of
Freedom Party win in Italy’s next elections, Berlusconi told his
ally, according to the Rome-based newspaper. Berlusconi also
said Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  has “an ideological
bias” against the amnesties, Repubblica reported.  On Oct. 7 Berlusconi’s office denied that the government
was considering a plan for an amnesty on tax evasion or other
transgressions as part of efforts to improve public finances.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
