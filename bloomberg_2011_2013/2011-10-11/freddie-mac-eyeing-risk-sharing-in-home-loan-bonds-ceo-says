Freddie Mac  may start using a type
of securitization that it issues in its apartment-lending
operations to off-load some of the credit risk on home loans,
Chief Executive Officer Charles E. Haldeman said.  The government-supported mortgage-finance company’s so-
called K series multifamily bonds, in which it guarantees only a
senior-ranked class of the debt, have been “wonderfully well-
received by the marketplace,” Haldeman said today at the
Mortgage Bankers Association’s annual conference in Chicago.  The company has issued more than $9 billion of the
securities in the past two years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac is discussing the
idea of conducting similar deals tied to home loans with its
regulator, the  Federal Housing Finance Agency , Haldeman said.  “Our hope is that through working with FHFA we can take
some of what we’ve learned in the multifamily business and apply
it to the single family business,” he said. “We’re still in
the talking phase,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
