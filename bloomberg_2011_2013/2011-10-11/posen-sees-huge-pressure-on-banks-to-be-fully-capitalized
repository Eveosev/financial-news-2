Bank of England  policy maker  Adam
Posen  said there will be “huge pressure” to reduce the size of
banks and recapitalize them.   “There’s going to be huge pressure to get national banks
or subsidiaries down in size and fully capitalized,” Posen said
at a conference in  New York  today. “We’re going to end up de
facto with several forms of ring fencing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
