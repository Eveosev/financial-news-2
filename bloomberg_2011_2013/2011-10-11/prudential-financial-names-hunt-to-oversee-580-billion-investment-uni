Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, named David Hunt of McKinsey &
Co. to run the investment operation with more than $580 billion
under management.  Hunt will be chief executive officer of Prudential
Investment Management effective Nov. 9, replacing Charles Lowrey, who was promoted in February to lead U.S. operations for
the Newark, New Jersey-based insurer, the company said today in
a statement distributed by Business Wire.  Rivals including Aflac Inc. and MetLife Inc., the largest
U.S. life insurer, named new fund managers this year as low
 interest rates  pressured fixed-income investments. Hunt will
oversee bonds, real estate and equity holdings and mutual-fund
and wealth-management businesses, the company said.  Hunt has a “breadth of institutional and wealth-management
experience in the U.S. and internationally,” Lowrey said in the
statement.  At McKinsey, Hunt worked in  Japan ,  Europe  and the Middle
East, advising clients on portfolio management and product
distribution, according to Prudential. He previously led the
firm’s North American commercial and investment-banking
practice. He has a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University
and a master’s degree in business administration from the
University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
