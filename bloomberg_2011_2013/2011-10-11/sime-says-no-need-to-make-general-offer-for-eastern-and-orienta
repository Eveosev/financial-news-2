Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME)  is not obliged to
make a mandatory general offer for Eastern and Oriental Bhd.,
the company said, following a review by the Securities
Commission.  Sime, which bought a 30 percent stake in Eastern and
Oriental, wasn’t acting in concert with Terry Tham Ka Hon, and
as such a general offer obligation would not arise, according to
the securities regulator’s findings, Sime said in a statement
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
