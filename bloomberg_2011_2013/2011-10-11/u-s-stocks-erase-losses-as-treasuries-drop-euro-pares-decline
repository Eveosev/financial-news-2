U.S. stocks erased losses as an
advance in commodity and technology shares helped the market
overcome an early drop triggered by concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
will worsen. Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year note yields to a
one-month high, before $66 billion in note and bond auctions
this week.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,196.31 as of 10:32 a.m. New York time after slumping as much
as 0.6 percent. The 10-year note’s yield climbed nine basis
points to 2.17 percent as trading resumed following the Columbus
Day holiday. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities pared its drop to
0.5 percent after retreating as much as 1.3 percent. The euro
was down 0.2 percent at $1.3611, recovering from an earlier 0.6
percent slide.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
