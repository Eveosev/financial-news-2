Australia ’s lower house of
parliament today passed Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s plan to
curb  carbon emissions  to reduce the country’s reliance on coal.  Australia plans to make about 500 polluters pay A$23 a ton
for their carbon emissions starting next year before switching
to a cap-and-trade system three years later. Gillard’s carbon
tax is due for a vote in the upper house Senate next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
