Senior members of German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s coalition will take decisions on Oct. 21 on
topics including tax reductions, personal data retention,
infrastructure financing and immigration, the  Rheinische Post 
newspaper reported, citing undisclosed government officials.  Leaders of the three coalition parties and their
parliamentary groups will also discuss the stabilization of the
euro and regulation of financial markets, the newspaper said
today. The meeting aims to set the government’s agenda in the
run-up to the 2013 federal election, it said.  Merkel will hold a preparatory meeting with leaders of her
Christian Union block late on Oct. 20, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
