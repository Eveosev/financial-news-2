The Joint Organization Data
Initiative, an association supervised by the world’s biggest
gathering of energy ministers, plans to publish data on natural
gas supply and demand by October 2012.  The group, backed by the International Energy Forum, aims
to put out the information “by this same time next year,” Dr.
Said Nachet,  executive director , said today in Beijing. JODI
will also gather information from governments on expansions in
exploration, refining and natural gas, he said.  “The industry is forward looking,” he said at a press
conference today. “Perceptions about possible shortages in the
future will also influence the market in the short term.”  The Riyadh-based Energy Forum represents 87 countries
including China, the U.S. and  Saudi Arabia , which account for
about 90 percent of  global oil  and gas supply and demand.  JODI was established by organizations including Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation, Eurostat, International Energy
Agency, Latin American Energy Organization, Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, and United Nations Statistics
Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
