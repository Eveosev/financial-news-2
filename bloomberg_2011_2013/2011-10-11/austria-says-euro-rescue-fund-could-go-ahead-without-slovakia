The European rescue fund could be
expanded even without Slovakia’s parliament supporting the
decision today, Austrian Vice ChancellorMichael Spindelegger
told reporters in Vienna today.  “There are two options,” Spindelegger said before the
government’s weekly meeting in the Austrian capital. “Either
we’ll do it anyway, and create a rescue program without
Slovakia, or we’ll have a completely new situation to deal
with,” he said.  Spindelegger also said that it is “counterproductive”
when German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  meet in bilateral summits to determine the
euro’s fate. “It can’t be that two are telling everybody in
advance what’s going to happen in the European Union or the euro
area,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
