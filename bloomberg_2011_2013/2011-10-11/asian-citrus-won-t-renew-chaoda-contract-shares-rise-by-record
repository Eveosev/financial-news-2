Asian Citrus Holdings Ltd. (73) , an
operator of orange plantations in China, rose by a record in
Hong Kong after saying it won’t renew a contract with a company
owned by a man accused of insider trading.  The stock climbed 23 percent, the biggest gain since its
debut in November 2009, to HK$5.52 as of 1:35 p.m. on the city’s
stock exchange. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 3.1
percent.  Asian Citrus won’t renew the fertilizer supply agreement
with Fujian Chaoda Group after the contract expires in June
2012, according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange
yesterday. Fujian Chaoda is 95 percent owned by Chaoda Modern
Agriculture (Holdings) Ltd. Chairman Kwok Ho, it said.  Kwok, Chaoda Chief Financial Officer Andy Chan, and
Fidelity Management’s George Stairs were accused by Hong Kong’s
financial secretary of  insider trading , according to a notice
released by the tribunal on Sept. 28.  Asian Citrus decided not to renew the contract with Fujian
Chaoda in order to “enhance the group’s corporate governance
and minimize any dispensable connected transactions,” according
to yesterday’s statement.  Boston-based Fidelity Investments conducted a thorough
internal review of the matter in 2009 and believes that Stairs
didn’t violate any laws or regulations, according to spokesman
 Vincent Loporchio . Kwok and Chan have disputed the allegations,
said Chaoda Modern.  To contact the reporter on this story:
