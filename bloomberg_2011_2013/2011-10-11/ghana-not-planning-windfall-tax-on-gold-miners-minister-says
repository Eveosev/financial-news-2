Ghana , Africa’s second-biggest gold
miner, has no immediate plans for a so-called windfall tax on
producers of the precious metal, said Deputy Finance Minister
Seth Terkper.  The price of gold is “volatile” and a windfall tax may
affect companies that invested in Ghana when the commodity’s
price was lower and now want to recoup their costs, he said in
an interview in Accra, the capital, today.  “Some might have incurred losses in the early stages of
production so we can’t just charge extra taxes on the spur of
the moment,” he said.  Ghana changed the royalty rate that it charges mining
companies to a fixed 5 percent from a previous range of 3
percent to 6 percent, Dan Owiredu, president of the Ghana
Chamber of Mines, said in May.  South Africa ’s  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Newmont Mining
Corp. (NEM)  of Greenwood, Colorado, have so-called stability
agreements fixed at 3 percent.  South Africa is the continent’s top producer of the metal.
Earlier today, Reuters cited Finance Minister Kwabena Duffuor as
saying Ghana is in talks with gold miners about extra taxes,
including the possibility of a windfall tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
