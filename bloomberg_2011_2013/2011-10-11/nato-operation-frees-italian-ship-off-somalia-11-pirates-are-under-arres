A NATO operation led by the U.S. and
the U.K. freed an Italian ship off  Somalia , rescuing its crew
and capturing 11 pirates who hijacked it yesterday, the Italian
Foreign Ministry said.  NATO forces under the command of Italian Admiral Gualtiero
Mattesi stormed the ship and freed its 23 crew members, who hail
from Italy, Ukraine and  India , the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement from Rome. The crew “managed, despite the dramatic
circumstances, to steer the ship toward the International
Traffic Recognized Corridor,” the ministry said.  The ship, called the Montecristo, was carrying scrap iron
from Liverpool,  England , to Vietnam when it was hijacked about
620 miles (1,000 kilometers) east of the Somali coast, the
shipping company D’Alesio Group said yesterday. A Japanese
military escort accompanied it through the  Gulf of Aden , and the
ship was attacked after the escort had left, a spokesman for
D’Alesio said.  The Savina Caylyn, an Italian-flagged oil tanker, and the
Rosalia D’Amato, another Italian ship, were hijacked in the same
region by pirates on Feb. 8 and April 21 respectively. Neither
has yet been released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
