Asian stocks rose, sending a
regional index toward its biggest four-day advance since March
2009, as Chinese lenders surged after a state-owned  investment
company  bought bank shares and Japanese equities climbed on
resuming trade from a holiday.  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  surged 7.7 percent in Hong Kong after
Central Huijin Investment Ltd. said it began buying shares of
the four biggest national banks.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  China ’s No. 1
offshore oil explorer, climbed 3.9 percent as a pledge by
Germany and France to support Europe’s banks spurred commodity
prices.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , the Japanese trading company that gets
about 43 percent of sales from commodities, gained 1.8 percent
in  Tokyo .  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s largest exporter of consumer
electronics, jumped 5.7 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.7 percent to 115.64 as
of 7:25 p.m. in Tokyo as commodity prices also advanced after
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicholas
Sarkozy pledged at the weekend to deliver a plan to recapitalize
the  Europe ’s banks and address Greece’s debt crisis by Nov. 3.
More than four stocks rose for each that fell on the gauge.  “There is hope that if a comprehensive European bank
package is announced, the damage to the real economy will be
less than currently expected,” said Belinda Allen, a senior
investment analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management in Sydney, which oversees about $145 billion. “That
would be better news for global growth and commodity demand.”  Book Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 17 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 5 percent loss for the  S&P
500  and a 14 percent decline for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 11.6 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 12 times for the
S&P 500 and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  Companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index trade at about 1.3
times book value, compared with 2 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4
times for the Stoxx 600.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 2 percent today
as the nation’s markets resumed trading following a public
holiday.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index jumped 2.4 percent, while
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.6 percent and South
Korea’s Kospi Index climbed 1.6 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.6 percent
today, with declines deepening after European Central Bank
president Jean-Claude Trichet said the region’s debt crisis has
reached a “systemic dimension.”  In  New York  yesterday, the gauge rose 3.4 percent, its
biggest rally since August, with all 10 industry groups
advancing. The S&P 500 last week rebounded from the threshold of
a  bear market  on optimism Europe will tame its debt crisis and
after U.S. economic data improved.  China Banks Surge  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index completed its biggest four-day
gain since 2008 yesterday.  Bank of China surged 7.7 percent to HK$2.65 in Hong Kong
after Central Huijin began buying shares in the nation’s four
biggest banks following a drop in valuations to below levels
reached during the global financial crisis.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  jumped 13 percent to
HK$2.99. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. rose 6.7
percent to HK$4.31 and  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  rallied 5.8
percent to HK$5.11.  Commodity producers rallied after copper futures for
December delivery climbed 2.9 percent on the Comex in New York
yesterday, while crude oil for November delivery gained 2.9
percent. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals, including copper and aluminum, added 1.7

gold and silver, surged 4.4 percent to 296,500 won in  Seoul  and
Cnooc added 3.9 percent to HK$13.72 in Hong Kong.  “Commodity prices and stocks fell sharply over the last
few months on worries Europe would blow up, causing a collapse
in global growth,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
almost $100 billion under management. “The pledges from Merkel
and Sarkozy help provide confidence that this won’t happen.”  Sony jumped 5.7 percent to 1,496 yen in Tokyo. Daewoo
Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., a South Korean
shipbuilder that gets 98 percent of its revenue overseas,
advanced 2.9 percent to 24,750 won in Seoul.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a Hong Kong-listed global clothing
retailer, advanced 12 percent to HK$11 after hedge fund Lone
