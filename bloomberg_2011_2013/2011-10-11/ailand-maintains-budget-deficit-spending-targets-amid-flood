Thailand â€™s government maintained its
 budget deficit  and spending targets for the fiscal year started
Oct. 1, and asked state agencies to set aside money to help the
economy recover from nationwide floods.  State agencies have been asked to set aside 10 percent of
their investment and operating budgets to help aid the economy
once the floods subside, Worawit Jumpeerath, head of the Budget
Bureau, told reporters in Bangkok today. The budget deficit and
expenditure for fiscal 2012 remain unchanged, Worawit said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
