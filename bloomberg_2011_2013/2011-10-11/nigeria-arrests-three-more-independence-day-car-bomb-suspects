Nigeria’s State Security Service
said it arrested three additional suspects in connection with a
double car-bombing on  Independence Day  last year that killed 12
people in Abuja, the capital.  Investigators recovered three vehicles, more than 650
rounds of ammunition and three pistols from the suspects,
Marilyn Ogar, a spokeswoman for the service, said in an e-mailed
statement today. The suspects include a banker who allegedly
handled financial transactions related to the bombings for  Henry
Okah , the accused mastermind of the attacks, Ogar said.  Okah is facing terrorism charges in  South Africa  for his
alleged involvement in the incident. South African law allows
trials of alleged terrorists arrested or resident in the country
no matter where their acts were committed.  The bombs were detonated close to where Nigerian President
Goodluck Jonathan was celebrating the country’s 50 years of
independence.  The Movement for the Emancipation of the  Niger Delta , the
main armed group in the southern Niger River delta, claimed
responsibility for the Abuja bombing.  Charles Okah, the brother of alleged rebel leader Henry
Okah, and four others are facing charges of terrorism and
treason in federal court in Abuja over the Independce Day
bombings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
