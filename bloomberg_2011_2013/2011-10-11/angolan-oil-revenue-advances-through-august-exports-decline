Angola’s revenue from oil exports
increased 44 percent in the eight months through August on the
back of higher crude prices, according to data from the
country’s  Finance Ministry .  Revenue climbed to $24.95 billion from $17.33 billion in
the same period a year ago,  the Finance Ministry said in a
posting on its website . The numbers include revenue from
Sonangol EP and taxes charged to  oil companies  operating in
Africa’s second-largest crude producer after Nigeria.  The average price for exports rose to $108 a barrel so far
this year from $75.40 a year earlier. Shipments fell to about
1.6 million barrels a day from 1.8 million, the data showed.  Angola will not reach its target of 1.9 million barrels a
day in 2011 as the country tries to recover offshore production
in some blocks that fell by the end of last year, Oil Minister
Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos said June 7. He said the
nation, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, was comfortable with prices for Brent crude of $114
to $115 a barrel.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , BP Plc and  Total SA (FP)  are among oil
companies operating in Angola.  To contact the reporter on this story:
