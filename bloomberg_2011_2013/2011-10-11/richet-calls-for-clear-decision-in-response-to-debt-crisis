European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said that there needs to be a clear decision
by governments in response to the region’s debt crisis.  “It is a matter of urgency that all authorities act in
unison to safeguard financial stability,” Trichet told
lawmakers in Brussels today. The “crisis is systemic and must
be tackled decisively.”   On moves to aid municipal lender Dexia SA, Trichet said
that “it’s extremely important that the decisions taken are
implemented immediately in the three countries concerned.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
