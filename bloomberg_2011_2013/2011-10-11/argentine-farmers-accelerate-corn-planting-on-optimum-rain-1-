Corn farmers in  Argentina , the
world’s second-largest exporter, may finish sowing in the main
producing region by the end of the month after rain allowed
growers to speed up planting, the Rosario Cereals Exchange said.  Producers have planted about half the corn crop and can
resume sowing after a few days of “fantastic” precipitation,
said Cristian Russo, an agronomist at the Rosario exchange. The
main corn- and soybean-growing areas received as much as 80
millimeters (3.1 inches) of rain in the past four days, the
exchange said on its  website  today.  Some farmers were expected to halt or slow down planting
until at least November after a month of below-average rainfall,
the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said Oct. 3.  The main growing
region may receive more rain in the next few days, Russo said in
a telephone interview from Rosario today.  Rainfall since Oct. 7 was “almost optimum” for the
country’s crops, he said. “Now the conditions are right” to
finish planting by the end of the month, he said.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 4.5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $6.095 a bushel at 9:36 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The U.S. is the world’s biggest corn producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
