OPEC’s crude-oil production dropped
last month as  Saudi Arabia  and  Nigeria  reduced output, according
to the group’s secretariat.  The 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries bound by quotas produced 27.24 million barrels a day
in September, Vienna-based OPEC said today in its monthly oil
market report. Output fell from 27.31 million in August, the
group said, citing secondary sources for the data.  Saudi Arabia, the group’s largest producer, pumped 9.59
million barrels a day in September, down 1.3 percent from the
previous month, partly as domestic industrial demand dropped,
according to the report.  “Given the decline in oil use by the industrial sector,
Saudi oil demand was slightly weaker this summer,” OPEC said.  OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
announced its biggest-ever supply cuts in late 2008 amid a
collapse in global demand. The decision capped production at
24.845 million barrels a day for all members except  Iraq .  The group’s compliance with those cuts rose to 43 percent
in September from a revised 41 percent in August, according to
Bloomberg calculations. Compliance percentages are based on
combined output from the 11 members that committed to reduce
from a base rate in September 2008 of 29.045 million barrels.  OPEC’s production including Iraq fell by 77,400 barrels a
day to 29.9 million barrels in September, the data show. Iraq is
exempt from the quota system.  The group’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran ,
Iraq, Kuwait,  Libya , Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
