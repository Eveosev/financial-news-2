Oil dropped for the first day in six
in  New York  after Slovakian lawmakers rejected a planned boost
to the euro region’s bailout fund, aimed at taking the region’s
debt crisis.  Crude for November slid as much as 61 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $85.20 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and was at $85.26 at 9:14 a.m. Sydney
time. The contract yesterday gained 0.5 percent to settle at
$85.81 a barrel.  Slovak lawmakers need to vote again “as soon as possible”
on an overhaul of the enhanced bailout mechanism, Prime Minister
Iveta Radicova told reporters in Bratislava.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
