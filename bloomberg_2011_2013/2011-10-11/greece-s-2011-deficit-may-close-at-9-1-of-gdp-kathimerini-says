Greece ’s 2011 budget deficit may be
9.1 percent of gross domestic product, according to a European
Union,  European Central Bank  and International Monetary Fund
mission, Kathimerini said.  The so-called troika, which completed its fifth review of
the country’s economy, found Greece will miss the original
target of 7.5 percent of GDP as well as a revised target of 8.5
percent for this year in the 2012 budget draft, the Athens-based
daily reported, without citing anyone.  Greece has enough cash reserves to last to the end of the
year and possibly the start of next year, in part due to revenue
from extraordinary levies, the newspaper said.  <a href="www.kathimerini.gr">Click here for web link</a>  To contact the reporter on this story:
