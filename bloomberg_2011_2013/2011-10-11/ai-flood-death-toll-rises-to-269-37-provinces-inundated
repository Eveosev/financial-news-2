At least 269 people have been killed
as a result of seasonal monsoon rains that have hit  Thailand 
since July 25, the Department of Disaster Prevention and
Mitigation said on its website.  About 37 of Thailand’s 77 provinces remain underwater, the
agency said.  “The influence of a tropical depression remains very
strong in the central and eastern regions,” the agency said.
“That will cause more heavy rain in Bangkok and eastern regions
over the next few days.” Rain in the country’s northern regions
has subsided, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
