Bank of England  policy maker  David
Miles  said the Monetary Policy Committee voted to extend its
emergency bond-purchase program as the outlook for demand and
inflation in the U.K. economy is weaker than a couple of months
ago.  “The assessment was made that the news that had come
through in the last few weeks meant that the outlook for demand
in the U.K. was that much weaker,” Miles said in an interview
broadcast on CNBC’s website today. “Commodity prices had fallen
and therefore the inflation pressures in the U.K., more likely
than not, a year to 18 months down the road, looked just weaker
than they had in August.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
