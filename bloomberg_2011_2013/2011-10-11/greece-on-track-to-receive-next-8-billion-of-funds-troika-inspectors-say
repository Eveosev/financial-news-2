A European Union,  International
Monetary Fund  and European Central Bank team of inspectors said
 Greece  has overall made important progress in fiscal
consolidation, according to an e-mailed statement from the
European Commission’s offices in Athens on completion of a
review of the country’s economy.  “The success of the program continues to depend on
mobilizing adequate financing from private sector involvement
(PSI) and the official sector,” the statement said. ‘‘Ongoing
discussions on PSI together with assurances provided by European
leaders at their July 21 summit suggest that the program remains
fully financed.’’  Once the Eurogroup and the IMF’s Executive Board have
approved the conclusions of the fifth review, the next tranche
of 8 billion euros will become available, most likely, in early
November, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
