The  Las Vegas  Strip’s recovery
faltered in August as casino gambling fell 8.7 percent on a
decline in baccarat revenue.  Strip betting declined to $496.9 million, Nevada’s Gaming
Control Board said today in an e-mail. Revenue rose 5.2 percent
in the first eight months of 2011 from a year earlier.  Las Vegas has been staging an uneven recovery from a record
two-year drop in gambling and conventions. Baccarat revenue,
which rose to a record in August 2010, was a main contributor to
the total revenue drop in August 2011, according to  Joseph Greff , an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York.  “Backing out baccarat results, total win on the Las Vegas
Strip was actually up 4.7 percent in August,” Greff said in a
note today. “We believe our gradual recovery thesis for the LV
Strip remains intact.”  The four biggest casino operators on the Strip --  MGM
Resorts International (MGM) , Caesars Entertainment Corp.,  Las Vegas
Sands Corp. (LVS) , and  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  -- have said a recovery was
under way in their most recent earnings calls.  “I do feel like Las Vegas is coming back, albeit slowly,”
 Sheldon Adelson , chairman and chief executive officer of Las
Vegas Sands, said in a Sept. 21 interview with Bloomberg News.
“The gaming propensity in one respect has gone down in the
 United States , and has gone up because more foreigners,
particularly Asians, are coming to Las Vegas.”  Convention Bookings  A rise in conventions, which help Strip hotels fill their
rooms midweek, may be key to a Las Vegas recovery, according to
Investment Technology Group Inc.’s Sept. 8 industry report. Las
Vegas had begun to benefit from an upswing in business travel,
which started in late 2009, as conventions tend to book hotels a
year or more in advance, the report said.  Gambling revenue for all  Nevada  casinos dropped 6.1 percent
to $886.9 million in August, the board said. Monthly proceeds
for Clark County, which includes downtown Las Vegas as well as
the Strip, declined 6.7 percent to $752.2 million.  Visitors to Las Vegas increased 2.8 percent to 3.29 million
in August, the Las Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority said
today in a separate  report . Room rates rose
11 percent to $97.11 from a year earlier, the authority said.  That marks 18 straight months of increases in both,
according to the report.  Las Vegas Sands rose 1.1 percent to $45.08 at 3:12 p.m. in
New York trading, while MGM increased 2.5 percent to $9.83. Wynn
Resorts fell 0.2 percent to $139.43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
