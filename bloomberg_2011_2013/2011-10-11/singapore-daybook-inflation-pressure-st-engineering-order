Singapore ’s government said it needs
to remain vigilant against a resurgence of inflationary
pressures even as it expects price gains to moderate toward the
end of 2011.  “A stable  Singapore dollar  is an anchor of stability for
our small, open economy,” the government said in a statement to
elaborate on the plans presented by President Tony Tan in
parliament on Oct. 10. “Continued judicious management of the
effective exchange rate of the Singapore dollar against a trade-
weighted basket of currencies will help dampen inflationary
pressures while supporting economic growth in an uncertain and
volatile external environment.”  WHAT TO WATCH:
