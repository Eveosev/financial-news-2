Jim Chanos , founder of  New York- 
based hedge fund Kynikos Associates, said he kept his bearish
bets on European bank stocks after regulators banned new short
sales for some financial companies in August.  “We were short the European banks going into the ban so
we’ve remained short,” Chanos said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
