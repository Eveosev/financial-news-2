OAO Severstal may receive less than
2 percent of cash payments agreed in March for the sale of three
 steel mills  in the U.S. amid a dispute with buyer Renco Group
Inc.,  American Metal Market  reported.  Severstal, Russia’s second-biggest steelmaker, in March
sold mills at Warren in Ohio, Wheeling,  West Virginia  and
Sparrows Point in Maryland to Renco for $1.2 billion, including
$125 million in cash and the rest in debt, according to a
regulatory filing at the time.  Renco is seeking to reduce the cash component of the deal
to $1.9 million, and Severstal has filed a claim in the federal
District Court in New York to dispute this, American Metal
Market said Oct. 6.  Natalia Ivanova, a Severstal spokeswoman in Moscow,
declined to comment. Bette Kovach, a spokeswoman for Renco’s
steel unit in  Maryland , couldn’t immediately be reached by
telephone in calls made outside of normal office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
