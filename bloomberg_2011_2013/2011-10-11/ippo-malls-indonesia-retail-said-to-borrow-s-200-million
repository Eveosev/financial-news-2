Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust,
which invests in shopping malls across Southeast Asiaâ€™s biggest
economy, has completed a S$200 million ($156 million) term loan,
said a person familiar with the matter.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) ,  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN)  and  UBS AG (UBSN)  joined the so-called club loan, the
person said. The three-year facility comprises a S$150 million
tranche and a S$50 million portion.  The loan pays a margin of 400 basis points more than the
Singapore interbank offered rate and proceeds will be used to
refinance debt, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
