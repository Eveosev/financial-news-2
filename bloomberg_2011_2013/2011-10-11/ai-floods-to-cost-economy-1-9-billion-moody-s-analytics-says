Thailand ’s flooding will probably
cost the nation’s economy $1.9 billion, Fred Gibson, an
associate economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a note today.
The inundation will disrupt industrial production and increase
near-term inflation, he said. Moody’s Analytics kept its Thai
economic growth estimate at 3.7 percent for 2011 and 3.9 percent
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
