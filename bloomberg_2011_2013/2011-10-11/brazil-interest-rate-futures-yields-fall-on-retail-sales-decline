Yields on Brazilian  interest-rate 
futures contracts fell after a report showed retail sales fell
more than forecast in August.  Yields on the contracts due in January 2013 fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.44 percent as of 9:46
a.m.  Sao Paulo  time. Trading in futures contracts suggests
traders are betting the central bank will lower the benchmark
interest rate at least 50 basis points at its Oct. 19 policy
meeting, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  August retail sales fell 0.4 percent, lower than the median
forecast of a 0.1 percent decline in a Bloomberg survey of 34
economists and compared with an increase of 1.4 percent in July.
Sales rose 6.2 percent from a year ago, the national statistics
agency said.  “Domestic consumption is indeed decelerating,” said  Zeina Latif , a senior economist with RBS Securities Inc. in Sao Paulo.
“Today’s data helps vindicate the central bank’s move in
August. There are some chances for the central bank to
accelerate the pace of interest rate cuts.”  The central bank unexpectedly lowered the benchmark
interest rate a half percentage point to 12 percent on Aug. 31
on concern the slowing global economy would crimp growth in
 Brazil .  The real lost 1.1 percent to 1.7825 per dollar, from 1.7632
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
