Irish energy minister Pat Rabbitte
said the government “reckoned” that 3.6 billion euros of
spending cuts and tax rises in 2012 will be enough to reach the
deficit target of 8.6 percent of gross domestic product.  In an interview with Dublin-based broadcaster RTE, Rabbitte
said that was the “advice” the government had received.  To contact the reporter on this story:
