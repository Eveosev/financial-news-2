Jim Chanos , founder of New York-
based hedge fund Kynikos Associates, said he’s betting against
 Vale SA (VALE3)  and other commodity-related companies with ties to
China.  Vale, the world’s biggest iron ore producer and a major
China exporter, is building “a fleet that is larger than the
U.S. Navy,” Chanos said today at the GAIM/GMA conference in New
York. Rio de Janeiro-based Vale shipped about 41 percent of its
total iron ore and pellet sales to China in the first quarter.  “Vale is one of the more aggressive miners that has
capital expenditure closely tied to China,” Chanos said in an
interview.  Chanos said he’s also betting against cement producers,
without naming them, and reiterated that he’s shorting Chinese
banks and property developers.  In short sales, investors sell shares they don’t own,
hoping the price will fall. If it does, the investors buy shares
at the cheaper price, return them to their owners and pocket the
difference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
