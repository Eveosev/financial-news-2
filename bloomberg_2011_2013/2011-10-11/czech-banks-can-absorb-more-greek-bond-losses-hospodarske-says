Czech banks could absorb further
writedowns on Greek bonds without a major impact on their
earnings or lending,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Henri Bonnet of  Komercni Banka AS. (KOMB)   “It is possible that private investors will be required to
shoulder a possible 50 percent reduction in the value of Greek
bonds and we will have to adapt,” Bonnet told the newspaper.
“More writedowns on Greek bonds would be unpleasant, but would
have no significant impact on domestic banks’ earnings. Their
lending capacity would not suffer either.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
