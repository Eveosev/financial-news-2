Voestalpine AG (VOE) ’s Chief Executive
Officer Wolfgang Eder said the European debt crisis will likely
harm the outlook for the region’s steel sector,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing an interview.  The uncertainty due to market tensions “is beginning to
affect the real economy,” Eder was quoted as saying. He expects
the European steel production to stagnate in the next two years,
according to the report.  While Voestalpine has some contingency plans ready in case
the economy is cooling significantly, the company’s capacity
utilization is at 100 percent until the end of the year, the
newspaper quoted Eder as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
