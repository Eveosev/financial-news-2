The European Union’s top banking
regulator is telling lenders to achieve a 7 percent core Tier
One capital ratio as part of a review, Reuters reported, citing
banking and regulatory sources.  The European Banking Authority demanded that banks achieve
a significantly stronger capital position and may need to raise
about 100 billion euros ($136 billion), Reuters said. It hasn’t
been determined what assets will be counted as core Tier One.  Banks must submit data through the end of June to the
regulator by the end of today, Reuters said.  A spokeswoman for the EBA declined comment on the Reuters
story when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
