Tesco Plc (TSCO)  Chief Executive Officer
 Philip Clarke  said his biggest concern is a shortage of talent
rather than weakening consumer demand.  “People are focused on what isn’t good, but I just see
opportunities and I see a shortage of skill, I see a shortage of
talent,” the head of the world’s third-largest retailer said at
the Institute of Grocery Distribution conference in London
today. “ Consumer confidence  is falling all over the world, but
that’s always been a challenge we’ve had to face.”  The Cheshunt, England-based grocer, which has more than
2,800 domestic stores, will invest about 1.6 billion pounds
($2.5 billion) in the U.K. this year, Clarke said, adding that
he’s never known a time of “so many opportunities.” Tesco will
spend more outside its home market, though the U.K. needs to be
“cherished,” with decisions made locally, he said.  “Sometimes you have to put aside just the pursuit of
profit in the market in order to get back in tune with the
nation, which is what Big Price Drop and other things that are
coming in the second half of the year” are about, the CEO said.  Tesco’s 500 million-pound ($782 million) price campaign
involves 3,000 everyday items. The retailer said last week that
it won’t increase profit in the second half, which is “very
unusual for Tesco,” Clarke said.  Joanne Denney-Finch, CEO of the IGD, told the conference
that supermarkets are up against “the low-growth economy,
sustainability, scarce resources, inflation, the squeeze on
household budgets, the promotional merry-go-round.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
