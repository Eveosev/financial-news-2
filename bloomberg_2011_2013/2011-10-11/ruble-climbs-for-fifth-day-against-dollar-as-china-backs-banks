The ruble strengthened against the
dollar, poised for its longest winning streak in three months
after Urals crude oil jumped yesterday and a Chinese state-run
fund said it began buying shares of the nation’s biggest banks.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 31.4256 per
dollar as of 10:32 a.m. in Moscow, a fifth day of gains. That’s
the longest winning streak since July 4, the data show. The
ruble advanced 0.5 percent to 42.8207 per euro, leaving it 0.4
percent stronger at 36.5514 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  China ’s state-run Central Huijin Investment Ltd. started
buying the banks’ shares yesterday, according to a statement on
its website, bolstering emerging-market assets. Urals crude,
 Russia ’s main oil export blend, climbed 2.9 percent to $107.49 a
barrel yesterday, the highest close since Sept. 21.  Investors pared bets the Russian currency would weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing it at 31.8728 per
dollar in three months.  Russia’s dollar Eurobond due 2020 was little changed,
leaving the yield steady at 5.173 percent. The yield on
government dollar debt due 2015 declined eight basis points to
4.04 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
