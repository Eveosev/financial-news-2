The recent decline in  Kenya ’s
foreign-exchange reserves is largely because of sales by the
central bank to support the shilling, Central Bank of Kenya
Governor Njuguna Ndung’u told reporters today in Nairobi.  Kenya’s reserves declined to $3.73 billion last week from
$3.78 a week earlier, the central bank said on Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
