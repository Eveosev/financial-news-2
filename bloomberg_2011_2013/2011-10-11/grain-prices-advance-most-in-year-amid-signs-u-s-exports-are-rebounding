Corn increased, extending the
largest advance since June 2010, on signs last month’s 23
percent slump may have attracted buyers seeking to build
stockpiles.  Corn inspected for export rose 8.7 percent from a week
earlier to 31.8 million bushels in the week ended Oct. 6, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said. The corn inspected included
4.7 million bushels bound for  China , the second-largest user of
the grain, the USDA said. The department will today release its
latest supply-and-demand report on corn and other crops.  “The lower prices generated some buying interest,”
 William Adams , a portfolio manager at Resilience AG in Zurich,
said today by e-mail. “Russia may enact its export tariffs
again. Not a bad environment if you are a seller. The potential
USDA revisions and government jaw-boning are making the market
afraid to get caught short.”  Corn for December delivery rose 6 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$6.51 a bushel at 10:36 a.m. London time on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, after jumping 6.6 percent yesterday, the biggest closing
gain for a most-active contract since June 30, 2010.  Mexico , the second-largest corn importer, bought 261,200
metric tons of corn from U.S. exporters, the department said.  “Export business is forecast to return with values at
these levels,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , wrote in a report today. That
outlook “was vindicated by the big purchase” of U.S. corn by
Mexico, he said.  Global Inventories  Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.1 percent to
$6.6125 a bushel in Chicago. It jumped 8.1 percent yesterday,
the biggest closing gain for a most-active contract since Oct.
8, 2010.  Soybeans for delivery in November fell 0.2 percent to
$12.33 a bushel, after closing 4.9 percent higher yesterday,
also the biggest advance since Oct. 8, 2010.  About 51 percent of the soybeans planted in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower and shipper, had been harvested as of
Oct. 9, up from 19 percent a week earlier, the USDA said
yesterday. About 56 percent of the U.S. crop was in good to
excellent condition as of Oct. 9, compared with 54 percent a
week earlier, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
