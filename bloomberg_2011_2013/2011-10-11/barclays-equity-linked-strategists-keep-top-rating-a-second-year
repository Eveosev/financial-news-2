among equity-linked strategists in Institutional Investor
magazine’s annual survey, beating teams from  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)   Evren Ergin and Venu Krishna won the top ranking for a
second year in the category for equity derivatives and
convertible bonds, according to Institutional Investor’s annual
survey of fund managers. The team led by Marko Kolanovic,
JPMorgan’s global head of equity derivatives strategy, was in
second place for a second year, while Bank of America’s group
run by Benjamin Bowler and Tatyana Hube was third.  The equity-linked securities category was created last
