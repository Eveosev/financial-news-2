Corn fell in  Chicago  on speculation
the U.S. may raise its global supply estimate tomorrow,
intensifying competition among exporters. Wheat advanced.  Inventories of corn will probably reach 120.5 million
metric tons at the end of this season, higher than last month’s
117.4 million-ton projection by the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture , according to the average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Investors should close out positions
until the report’s release, said economist  Dennis Gartman .  “Zero positions are the order of the day,” he said in his
daily Gartman Letter. “Discretion is the far, far better part
of valor here.”  Corn for December delivery declined 4.5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $6.005 a bushel by 10:45 a.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain reversed a gain of as much as
0.7 percent and retreated for a second session in three.  Ukraine, set to become the world’s third-biggest corn
exporter, will probably ship about 10 million tons of grains
overall in the first half of this marketing year, Volodymyr
Lapa, an analyst at the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club, said
yesterday.  Wheat for delivery in December rose 3.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $6.15 a bushel. Milling wheat for November delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris was unchanged at 184 euros ($250)
a ton.  Soybeans for delivery in November fell 2 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $11.755 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
