Atlantic City  casino gambling
revenue fell 0.6 percent in September, marking more than three
years of decline, as competition from casinos and slots in
neighboring states continued to attract gamblers.  Betting returns shrank to $294.7 million from a year
earlier,  New Jersey ’s Division of Gaming Enforcement said today
on its  website . Slot machine revenue at the 11 casinos declined
1.9 percent and table game winnings rose 2.7 percent.  The drop was the smallest in more than a year, according to
New Jersey Casino Control Commission data. Revenue in Atlantic
City has been declining for 37 consecutive months. New Jersey
Governor  Chris Christie  this year offered greater state
assistance in return for overhauled regulations to help limit
losses in Atlantic City.  “We think results will continue to remain soft, given our
view of increased competition/alternatives for customers at
nearby jurisdictions,”  Joseph Greff , an analyst at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in  New York , wrote in a note today.  Christie’s reforms included creation of a state-run tourism
district in the area of the casinos and the Boardwalk and
redirecting gaming tax revenue to improve the city.  Gambling in the second-biggest U.S. casino market after  Las
Vegas  fell to $3.57 billion in 2010 from a peak of $5.2 billion
in 2006.  For the nine months through September, revenue in Atlantic
City slid 7.8 percent to $2.6 billion from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
