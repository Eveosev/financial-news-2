Ezri Namvar, a  Los Angeles 
businessman and real-estate developer, got a seven-year prison
term for stealing $21 million from clients who deposited the
funds with his firm for tax-free exchange transactions.  Namvar, 59, was sentenced today in Los Angeles federal
court and ordered to pay $21 million in restitution, U.S.
Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said in a statement. He was found
guilty of four counts of  wire fraud  after a jury trial in May.  Namvar misused the money from real-estate transactions that
four clients deposited with his company,  Namco Financial
Exchange Corp. , for safekeeping until it was reinvested,
according to prosecutors.  He used $21 million of the $25 million entrusted to him for
unauthorized purposes including paying creditors of his
 investment company ,  Namco Capital Group Inc. , according to the
government.  Marc S. Harris , a lawyer for Namvar, said that he will file
an appeal and that he’s optimistic that it will succeed.  “We are very disappointed with the sentence,” Harris said
in a phone interview.  The case is U.S. v. Namvar, 2:10-cr-01055, U.S. District
Court, Central District of  California  (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
