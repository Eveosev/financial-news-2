South Korea ’s unemployment rate held
near a three-year low last month as the service sector,
wholesalers and retailers hired more workers.  The jobless rate was at 3.2 percent in September, compared
with 3.1 percent in August, Statistics Korea said today in
Gwacheon, south of Seoul. That matched the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 10 economists.  South Korea’s central bank will extend tomorrow a pause in
interest-rate increases as weakness in European economies and
the U.S. threatens demand for the nation’s exports, according to
a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Economist  Nouriel Roubini 
told a forum in Seoul yesterday that  Europe ’s response to its
debt crisis risks being “too little, too late.”  “Labor market conditions remain tight,” Wai Ho Leong, a
senior regional economist at  Barclays Capital  in  Singapore , said
before the release. “Still, the central bank will stand pat, on
escalation of financial market turmoil.”  The won rose 0.6 percent to 1,164.50 per dollar as of 3
p.m. close in Seoul yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,160.80, the strongest level
since Sept. 23. The benchmark Kospi stock index gained 1.6
percent.  The seasonally unadjusted jobless rate was at 3 percent in
September, unchanged from August, today’s report showed. The
number of employed people increased by 264,000, or 1.1 percent,
to 24.318 million last month from a year earlier.  Employment in manufacturing fell 1.2 percent from a year
earlier, while the number of people self-employed or working in
the public-service sector increased 2.5 percent.  The number employed in the electricity, transportation,
telecommunication and finance sectors rose 6.1 percent, while
jobs in the agricultural, fishery and forestry industries
declined 3.3 percent.  The health and welfare service sector added 120,000 jobs
while wholesalers and retailers added 88,000 jobs in September
from a year ago, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
