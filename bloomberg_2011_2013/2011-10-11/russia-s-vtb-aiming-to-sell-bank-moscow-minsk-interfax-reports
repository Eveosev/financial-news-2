reported.  Four potential buyers are interested in  Bank Moscow-Minsk ,

of VTB’s Belarus  subsidiary , declining to provide their names.  VTB will integrate Bank Moscow-Minsk with its Belarusian
unit if the sale fails, Ivanov was cited as saying by Interfax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
