Colombia may pare next year’s local
bond auction plan as quickening economic growth bolsters  tax
revenue  and reduces the government’s financing needs, said
Public Credit Director German Arce.  “If there are any surprises, these will be positive in
fiscal terms,” Arce said in an interview today in his Bogota
office. “We’ve had a good year in terms of tax revenue and the
economy is growing at a good pace.”  The government will announce new figures for its 2012
financing program in December, Arce said. A reduction in the
plan would be the second this year. Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry trimmed last month the planned offerings to 18.6
trillion pesos ($9.7 billion) from an initial 20 trillion pesos
after a debt swap lowered financing needs.  Colombia ’s central bank raised its 2011 economic growth
forecast in July to as high as 6.5 percent even as  Europe ’s debt
crisis prompted banks from UBS AG to Citigroup Inc. to cut their
forecasts for the global expansion. The surge in growth likely
will push tax revenue this year to 81.2 trillion pesos, up from
a previously expected 75.3 trillion pesos, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said on Oct. 7.  Colombia has no plans to begin meeting its 2012 financing
needs by auctioning more local bonds, known as TES, after this
year’s issuance program ends this month, according to Arce.  Yield Forecast  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
today to 7.49 percent. That’s up from a record low of 7.19
percent reached Sept. 8.  The government’s “good fiscal accounts” is also helping
drive down yields, said  Andres Pardo , the head analyst at
financial services holding company Corp. Financiera Colombiana,
known as Corficolombiana. Yields on the government’s peso bonds
will fall below 7 percent by the end of 2012, he said.  Colombia will grow 4.8 percent in 2012, compared with 5
percent in 2011, according to Pardo.  The South American country plans to sell yen-denominated
bonds next year as part of an effort “to diversify its investor
base,” Arce said. The government last sold bonds in  Japan  in
2009, when it issued 45 billion yen ($587 million) of 10-year
bonds to yield 2.42 percent.  Arce also said Colombia has no plans to repatriate dollar
funds held abroad.  Echeverry said in April that the government would create an
overseas fund with as much as $1.2 billion from dollars bought
in the local market through the end of 2011 in a bid to ease the
peso’s rally earlier this year. Arce declined to say how much
the government has bought so far.  “Those dollars are for our funding needs abroad,” Arce
said.  Colombia has $900 million of 10 percent dollar bonds due in
January 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
