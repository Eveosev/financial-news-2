Ghana, Africaâ€™s second-largest gold
producer, is in talks with producers of the precious metal about
extra taxes after gold prices increased, Reuters reported.  The West African nation is considering a number of options
including the possibility of a windfall tax, the news agency
said, citing Finance Minister Kwabena Duffuor. Any new tax would
form part of the 2012 budget to be presented to Parliament next
month, Reuters said, citing Duffuor.  Gold companies operating in Ghana include units of
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
