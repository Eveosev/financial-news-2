Forecasts from  Andrew Garthwaite ,
global equity strategist at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , will be
included in Bloomberg’s weekly survey of Standard & Poor’s 500
Index projections.  Doug Cliggott, the Boston-based U.S. equity strategist, had
been included in the survey since September 2010. His year-end
forecast for the S&P 500 of 1,100 was the lowest among 12
strategists in the Bloomberg poll. Garthwaite, based in London,
projects the measure will end this year at 1,180 and next year
at 1,260. It closed at 1,195.54 today. The average estimate in
the survey is 1,278.  To contact the reporter on this story:
