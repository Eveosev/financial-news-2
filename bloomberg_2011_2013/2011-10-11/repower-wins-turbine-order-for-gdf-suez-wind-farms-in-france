Repower Systems SE, a German wind
turbine maker, won an order to supply its machines to two wind
farms in  France  owned by  GDF Suez. (GSZ)   The producer, a unit of Asia’s third-largest turbine maker
Suzlon Energy Ltd. of  India , signed a contract to supply 23
units of 2.05 megawatts each with La Cie du Vent, a GDF Suez
unit, Hamburg-based Repower said today in an e-mailed statement.
Financial details weren’t disclosed.  They will be used at the La Bretelle and Echalot farms in
Burgundy, “the most important projects that our company has
ever built in France,” Jean-Francois Innocenti, head of
construction at the GDF Suez unit, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
