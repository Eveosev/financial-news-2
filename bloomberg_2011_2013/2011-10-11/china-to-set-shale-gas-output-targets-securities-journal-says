China  aims to produce 6.5 billion
cubic meters of shale gas annually by 2015 under a government
plan to be released soon, the China Securities Journal reported,
citing an official at state-owned China National Petroleum Corp.  The nation will target 80 billion cubic meters of annual
shale-gas output by 2020 under the plan drafted by the National
Energy Administration, the newspaper said, citing Song Xiaodan,
a deputy chief economist at CNPC’s planning department.  China, which currently doesn’t produce any shale gas
commercially, aims to triple the use of natural gas to about 10
percent of energy demand by 2020 to rely less on more polluting
coal and oil. The country may have 1,275 trillion cubic feet (36
trillion cubic meters) of shale gas, 48 percent more than the
U.S., the Washington-based Energy Information Administration
said in a report in April.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386)  and Henan Provincial Coal
Seam Gas Development and Utilization Co. won exploration rights
in the country’s first auction of shale-gas blocks, the Ministry
of Land and Resources said in July. A second auction will be
held in the fourth quarter, Zhang Dawei, deputy director of oil
and gas strategy research at the land ministry, said yesterday.  --Jing Yang. Editors: Ryan Woo,  Paul Gordon .  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
