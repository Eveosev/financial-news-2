Rupert Murdoch ’s sons, James and
Lachlan, should be removed from News Corp.’s board in a
shareholder vote next week, Egan-Jones Proxy Services said.  Two other directors, Natalie Bancroft and Arthur M. Siskind, should also be removed in the Oct. 21 vote, Egan-Jones,
a shareholder adviser, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The directors’ lack of independence and oversight was
“very publicly visible” in a phone-hacking scandal at the
company’s now-closed News of the World newspaper, Egan-Jones
said in the statement. Another advisory firm, Institutional
Shareholder Services, yesterday recommended that 13 of the
board’s 15 members, including Murdoch and his sons, be removed.
Glass Lewis & Co., another advisory firm, has said the company
needs a more independent board.  Murdoch holds 40 percent of the company’s Class B voting
shares, making it difficult to enact board changes that differ
from his wishes. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a friend of the
Murdoch family, owns 7 percent of voting shares.  The 168-year-old News of the World was closed in July
following the phone-hacking allegations.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
 News Corp. (NWSA)  units in providing financial news and information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
