Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, won an extra 60 days to negotiate an end to a
dispute over about 4 billion reais ($2.3 billion) of unpaid
taxes, a government official familiar with the talks said.  Brazil ’s National Mineral Production Department, or DNPM,
will likely end the talks with Vale on the overdue mining
royalties in December, said an official at the agency, who asked
not to be named because the talks aren’t public. Negotiations
started in August and had originally been scheduled to end this
week. An official at Rio de Janeiro-based Vale’s press office
declined to comment.  Brazil is seeking to tighten its grip over mining after
boosting control of the oil industry last year. In addition to
claiming overdue levies, the government is preparing a bill to
increase mining taxes.  Vale Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira and Energy and
Mining Minister Edison Lobao met in August to discuss the
overdue royalties dispute.  Roger Agnelli  was replaced by
Ferreira in May amid government criticism that the company
didn’t invest enough in steel production and fired too many
workers during a 2009 recession in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
