China ’s stock-index futures rose,
signaling the benchmark index may rebound from the lowest level
in more than two years, after China’s state-run investment arm
said it began buying shares of the nation’s four biggest banks.  Futures on the CSI 300 Index expiring in October jumped 2.9
percent to 2,644 as of 9:16 a.m. local time.  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd.,  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) ,
 Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  and  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  may rally
after Central Huijin Investment Ltd. acquired their shares.  “Central Huijin’s move shows the government’s intention to
save the market, which is close to a bottom,” said Yang Delong,
a  fund manager  at China Southern Fund Management Co., which
oversees $21 billion. “This will help boost companies with
record low valuations such as banks and automakers in the short
term.”  The  Shanghai  Composite Index slipped 0.6 percent to
2,344.79 yesterday, the lowest since March 25, 2009. The CSI 300
Index lost 0.9 percent to 2,557.08. The Shanghai Composite has
tumbled 17 percent this year as the government raised interest
rates and reserve-requirement ratios for banks to cool inflation
that’s at the highest level in almost three years. The stock
measure is valued at 10.8 times estimated profit, the lowest
level on record, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg.  Central Huijin will continue with “related market
operations,” the unit of China’s sovereign wealth fund said,
without providing details on how much it will invest and whether
it will buy the shares in  Hong Kong  or Shanghai.  ‘Some Relief’  Central Huijin bought 14.6 million Shanghai-listed A shares
in ICBC, 7.38 million yuan-denominated shares of Construction
Bank, 39.1 million shares in AgriBank and 3.5 million shares in
 Bank of China , the four lenders said in separate statements to
the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.  The announcement will bolster the stock market, according
to China International Capital Corp.  “We should expect at least some relief on selling pressure
from this move by Huijin, if history is a guide,” Hao Hong, a
Beijing-based global equity strategist, said in a report to
clients.  The Shanghai Composite jumped 21 percent in a week after
the government said it would buy shares of the three largest
lenders on Sept. 18, 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., the government also cut  interest rates  for the
first time in six years, allowed most banks to set aside smaller
reserves and scrapped a tax on equity purchases.  Banks’ Performance  The CSI 300 Financials Index has fallen 16 percent this
year on speculation that some of the $3.5 trillion in new loans
made since the end of 2008 may sour as the world’s fastest-
growing economy slows. ICBC, the nation’s biggest lender, has
dropped 6 percent this year, extending last year’s 21 percent
slide. The stock trades at 6.73 times estimated earnings,
compared with the record low of 6.67 set on Sept. 26, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  PetroChina Co., the nation’s largest oil producer, may drop
after the government said it will extend a value-based tax on
oil and natural gas sales to the entire nation starting next
month to help conserve energy use in the world’s fastest-growing
major economy and boost local government revenues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
