FIM Ltd. and directors Carlo Grosso
and Federico Ceretti, defendants in a $975 million lawsuit
brought by the liquidator of  Bernard Madoff ’s firm against
Kingate Global Fund Ltd., asked a U.S. district judge to decide
whether trustee  Irving Picard  has a right to bring common-law
claims against them in light of a ruling in the HSBC Holdings
Plc case that threw out about $9 billion of Picard’s claims.  Grosso and Ceretti, Italian citizens living in London, and
FIM, incorporated in the U.K., said a district judge should also
decide whether Picard can sue them using U.S. law, according to
a court filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
