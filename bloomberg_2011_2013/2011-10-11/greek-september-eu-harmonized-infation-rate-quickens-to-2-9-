Greece ’s inflation rate rose in
September for the first time in six months after restaurants
started charging a higher sales tax.  The inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, increased to 2.9 percent from 1.4 percent in
August, the first annual increase since March, the Hellenic
Statistical Authority said in a statement from Athens today.
Using Greek methods, the rate was 3.1 percent.  Prime Minister George Papandreou’s government increased
sales tax on restaurants by 10 percentage points to 23 percent
as part of a package of measures approved in June to reduce the
 budget deficit  and continue receiving EU-led rescue funds. The
tax came into effect last month, helping push up an inflation
rate that had dropped steadily since peaking at 5.7 percent in
September of last year on previous  sales-tax  increases.  Prices for hotels, cafes and restaurants rose an annual 2.7
percent in September from 0.6 percent in August, today’s report
showed. Alcohol and tobacco costs increased 6.2 percent from 1.7
percent in the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
