Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said today’s statement from an EU-led mission on the
Greek economy was “balanced, practical and positive.”  “The next step isn’t just the payment of the sixth tranche
but the completion and activation of the July 21 decisions and
the start of a new program which gives a definitive and
convincing response to the major issue of the long-term
sustainability of public debt,” he said in an e-mailed
statement from the Athens-based Finance Ministry.  Venizelos said it was important to meet commitments to
creditors before the loan was disbursed, and possibly before EU
leaders meet on Oct. 23.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
