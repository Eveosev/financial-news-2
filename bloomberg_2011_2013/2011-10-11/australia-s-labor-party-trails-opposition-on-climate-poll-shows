Australia ’s opposition Liberal-
National coalition leads Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s Labor
government for the first time in a Newspoll survey as the party
judged better able to fight  climate change .  Support for the  Labor Party  on climate change fell to 28
percent, while backing for the coalition rose to 31 percent,
according to the survey published today in the Australian
newspaper. The opposition also holds the lead on the issue of
processing asylum-seekers, with support at 44 percent, compared
with 17 percent for Labor, the poll shows.  Australia’s parliament this week is due to vote on the
prime minister’s plan to introduce the country’s first tax on
greenhouse gas emissions to reduce its reliance on coal, as well
as proposed legislation on handling of asylum-seekers.  Gillard continues to trail  Tony Abbott  as the preferred
prime minister, with support at 35 percent, compared with the
opposition leader’s 40 percent, according to the poll, which had
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points and was
conducted Oct. 7 through Oct. 9. Backing for Labor increased to
29 percent from 26 percent, while the coalition’s support
climbed to 49 percent from 48 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
