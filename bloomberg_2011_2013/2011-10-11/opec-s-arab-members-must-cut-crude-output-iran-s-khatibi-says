Arab OPEC members that boosted crude
exports to make up for reduced supply from  Libya  need to cut
production as the North African nation increases output, Iran
OPEC governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi said.  Certain members should return to the production level they
had prior to the Libyan crisis, in line with suggestions from
the group’s Secretary-General Abdalla el-Badri, Khatibi said,
without identifying the nations, according to the state-run  Mehr 
news agency.  There is no shortage in the global oil market and the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries won’t need to
change current quotas when it next meets on Dec. 14 in Vienna,
Khatibi said, according to the report.  Iran is OPEC’s second-largest producer after  Saudi Arabia 
and holds the group’s presidency this year. When the group last
gathered on June 8,  Iran  and five other members rejected a Saudi
proposal to raise output by 1.5 million barrels a day and the
meeting ended without agreement for the first time in at least
20 years. OPEC’s Arab members are Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
 Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
