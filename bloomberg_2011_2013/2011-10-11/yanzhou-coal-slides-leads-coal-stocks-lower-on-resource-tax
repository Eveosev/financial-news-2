Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. led declines
by coal producers after the government announced higher resource
taxes on coking coal.  Yanzhou Coal,  China â€™s fourth-biggest coal producer, lost 3
percent to 28.37 yuan as of 11:09 a.m. Shanghai time, set for
its biggest drop since Sept. 19. Yangquan Coal Industry Group
Co. retreated 5.9 percent to 22.60 yuan.  On a volume basis, China will levy a tax of 8 yuan to 20
yuan on every metric ton of coking coal sold starting next
month, the government said on its website. The tax on coking
coal is 8 yuan a ton currently, according to Anna Yu, a  Hong
Kong  based energy analyst with ICBC International Research Ltd.
Coking coal is an ingredient used in steel-making.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
