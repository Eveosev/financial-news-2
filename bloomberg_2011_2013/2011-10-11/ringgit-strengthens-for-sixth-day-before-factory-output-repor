Malaysia ’s ringgit strengthened for
a sixth day, the longest winning streak since April, before data
today that may show factory output rebounded.  Industrial production climbed 0.4 percent from a year
earlier in August after contracting 0.6 percent in July,
according to the median forecast of 16 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The prediction comes after exports rose in August
at the fastest pace in four months and Prime Minister Najib Razak said economic growth may accelerate in 2012. A pledge by
policy makers in Europe to contain the region’s debt crisis
spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  “Confidence has returned to the market following
intensified efforts by policy makers in  Europe  to resolve their
debt problems,” said Syhiful Zamri, director of investment,
research and advisory at Kenanga Investors Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“These efforts will further support Malaysia’s economic
growth.”  The ringgit appreciated 0.6 percent to 3.1085 per dollar as
of 8:49 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency reached a high of 3.1050, the strongest
since Sept. 19.  The  European Central Bank  said governments should use the
440 billion euro ($600 billion) European Financial Stability
Facility to insure a portion of new bonds issued by debt-
strapped nations. That would leverage the amount available to
protect member states from the region’s debt crisis.  Malaysia’s gross domestic product will increase as much as
6 percent next year after climbing a maximum 5.5 percent in
2011, Prime Minister said in his annual budget speech on Oct. 7.
The deficit is forecast to narrow to 4.7 percent of GDP from 5.4
percent. The country’s statistics department will release the
factory-output data at 12:01 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .  Government bonds  fell yesterday. The yield on the 4.262
percent note due September 2016 gained one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.33 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
