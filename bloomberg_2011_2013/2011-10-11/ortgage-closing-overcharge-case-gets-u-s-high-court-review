The U.S.  Supreme Court  agreed to
clarify the scope of a federal law aimed at protecting home
buyers from being overcharged by companies that provide real
estate settlement services.  The justices today accepted an appeal from a group of
Louisiana consumers seeking to sue Quicken Loans Inc. over fees
they paid at their mortgage closings.  The home buyers say Quicken charged as much as $1,100 in
“loan discount fees” without providing the  interest-rate 
reduction those fees typically bring.  The fight at the high court centers on a provision in the
1974 Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act that bars settlement
providers in at least some cases from collecting money for
services they didn’t perform.  The question for the justices is whether that provision
applies only when two companies split the disputed fee -- as in
the case of a kickback. A New Orleans-based federal appeals
adopted that reading of the statute in throwing out the suit
against Detroit-based  Quicken , putting it at odds with other
courts around the country.  The Obama administration urged the Supreme Court to accept
the home buyers’ appeal and overturn the lower court ruling.  Quicken said in a statement that the suit’s underlying
premise is wrong.  “It is undisputed that the loan discount points collected
in this case were earned and resulted in a lower interest rate
for the borrowers,” the company said.  Quicken is a unit of closely held Rock Holdings Inc.  The case is Freeman v. Quicken, 10-1042.  To contact the reporter on this story:
