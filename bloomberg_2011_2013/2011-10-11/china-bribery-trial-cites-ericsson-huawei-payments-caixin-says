A former Chongqing official who
later became a China Mobile Communications Corp. executive
allegedly took bribes from Ericsson AB and Huawei Technologies
Co. in exchange for awarding contracts, Caixin Online reported.  Shen Changfu is accused of accepting a total of 36.2
million yuan ($5.7 million) dating to at least 1996, when he was
Chongqing Telecom Bureau deputy director, Caixin reported,
citing prosecutors at a trial that began yesterday in the
southwestern city. Shen also was president of China Mobileâ€™s
local branch.  Ross Gan, a spokesman for Shenzhen-based Huawei, declined
to comment on the Caixin report when contacted by Bloomberg News
today. Melody Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Ericsson, said
she had no information immediately available on the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
