Gold declined from a two-week high
as investors awaited a vote in Slovakia to approve the European
bailout fund.  Bullion for immediate delivery shed as much as 0.6 percent
to $1,666.65 an ounce, after climbing to $1,684.63 an ounce, the
highest level since Sept. 23. It traded at $1,668.25 at 4:10 p.m.
in Singapore. The metal jumped 2.4 percent yesterday, the most
since Sept. 8. Futures for December were little changed at
$1,669.90 an ounce.  “A plan to end  Europe ’s debt crisis is bearish for gold,
however until investors believe whatever plan they have is going
to work, gold will be supported,” Wang Xiaoli, chief investment
strategist at Citic Futures Co., said in an e-mail today.  Slovakia is the only country in the 17-nation euro area
that hasn’t ratified a planned reinforcement of the European
Financial Stability Facility. The nation’s four-part coalition
yesterday failed to resolve a dispute with rebel lawmakers,
threatening to delay measures to stem Europe’s debt crisis.  U.S. stock futures declined and the euro was little changed
after reaching a three-week high against the dollar yesterday as
Slovakia’s parliament prepared to vote. German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  pledged at the
weekend to deliver a plan by Nov. 3 to stem the debt crisis.  “We’re in the peak seasonal demand period now and that
should also help buoy  gold prices ,” said Wang, who was ranked
fifth in a Futures Daily and Securities Times poll of  China  gold
analysts.  In  India , the world’s largest consumer, the peak-demand
period began in August with Eid, continues in October with
Diwali, and is followed by the traditional wedding season. In
China, the second-biggest buyer, demand typically picks up
during the National Day holidays at the start of October through
till the Lunar New Year in January.  Cash silver lost 0.9 percent to $31.8237 an ounce after
climbing 1.5 percent to $32.565 an ounce. Spot platinum was
little changed at $1,521.75 an ounce, while palladium dropped
0.9 percent to $610.13 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
