Iranian members of parliament will
submit a motion to the assembly’s presiding board today to
impeach the country’s finance minister over a $2.6 billion bank
fraud,  Mehr  reported, citing one of the lawmakers.  About 25 deputies have signed the proposal and more are
expected to join, Nader Ghazipour said yesterday, according to
the state-run  news agency . The motion cites minister Shamseddin
Hosseini’s “incompetence in managing the country’s economic and
banking affairs,” Ghazipour said.  Seven state and private banks have been linked to the
fraud, the biggest in the country’s history. The case involved
the forging of letters of credit from Bank Saderat, which is
partly state-owned, to secure loans that were used to buy state-
owned companies. More than 30 people have been detained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
