Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  is set to
sell a 1 billion-pound portfolio of commercial real estate loans
for about 650 million pounds, or 35 percent less than their face
value, the Herald said, without saying where it got the
information.  The bank received more than 10 offers for the portfolio and
has reduced the number of bidders to fewer than five, the
Glasgow-based newspaper said.  Lloyds has already taken a writedown on the loans and is
not expected to make a further loss if it sells them for 650
million pounds, the paper said.  Lloyds is trying to dispose of a legacy book of real estate
loans, many of them acquired when it bought HBOS Plc during the
credit crunch, the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
