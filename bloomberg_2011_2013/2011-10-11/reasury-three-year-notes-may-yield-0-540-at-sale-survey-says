The Treasury Department’s $32
billion sale of three-year notes may draw a yield of 0.540
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 11 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 22 primary dealers.  The amount being offered is unchanged from the previous 12
sales of the maturity. The notes, which mature in October 2014,
yielded 0.550 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1
p.m. New York time. Last month’s auction of three-year notes
drew a record low yield of 0.334 percent.  The Sept. 12 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.15, compared with an average of 3.17 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 35.7 percent of the notes at the
September sale, compared with 47.9 percent at the August
auction. The average for the past 10 offerings is 35.8 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 10.6 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 12.8
percent for the past 10 auctions.  Three-year notes have returned 2.8 percent this year,
compared with a gain of 8.2 percent for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Treasury is selling $66 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It’s due to auction $21 billion of 10-year securities
tomorrow and will sell $13 billion of 30-year debt on Oct. 13.  The entire  amount being raised  this week is new cash, with
none of the proceeds dedicated to redeeming maturing securities,
according to the Treasury Department.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
