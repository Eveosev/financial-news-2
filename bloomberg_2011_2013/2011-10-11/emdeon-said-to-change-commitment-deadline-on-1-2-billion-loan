Emdeon Inc. (EM) , the provider of billing
systems and software for health-care companies, moved up the
commitment deadline for a $1.2 billion  term loan  B it’s seeking
to finance the company’s buyout by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) ,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  Investors have until Oct. 13 at 12 p.m. in New York to
submit commitments, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. The Nashville,
Tennessee-based company was originally seeking responses by Oct.
14.  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and SunTrust Banks Inc. are arranging
the deal, the person said. The banks plan to distribute the debt
to investors Oct. 14. The deal is expected to close and fund the
week of Oct. 31.  Emdeon is also seeking a $125 million revolving line of
credit maturing in five years.  Christine Anderson , a Blackstone spokeswoman, declined to
comment. Amanda Woodhead, an Emdeon spokeswoman, didn’t respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  A term loan B is mainly bought by non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank-loan mutual funds and
hedge funds. In a revolving credit, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
