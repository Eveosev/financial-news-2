An Indian court ordered  Wockhardt
Ltd. (WPL) , a maker of diabetes drugs, to pay 3.15 billion rupees ($64
million) to holders of its foreign currency convertible bonds
following a default, Bloomberg UTV reported today.  The settlement, including interest and a redemption
premium, should be made in five installments in the eight months
to August, the television channel said, citing the Bombay High
Court order. Failure will result in the appointment of a
liquidator for the company, the channel said.  The ruling clears the way for Mumbai-based Wockhardt to
proceed with the sale of its nutrition unit to  France ’s Danone
for 250 million euros ($340 million). The court had earlier
blocked the sale pending resolution of a case filed by creditors
after default.  Danone (BN)  announced the deal in August.  Wockhardt rose 10.2 percent to 443.80 rupees at 2:30 p.m.
Mumbai time, set for the biggest gain since Nov. 15. The
benchmark BSE  India  Sensitive Index was little changed.  A group of three bondholders including U.S. hedge fund QVT
Financial LP and an overseas unit of India’s  Sun Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (SUNP)  filed the petition after Wockhardt defaulted on
the convertible bonds that matured in October 2009.  The court ordered Wockhardt’s chief financial officer to
provide an affidavit within two weeks specifying the payment
schedule, the channel said. Creditors were also allowed to
withdraw 1.15 billion rupees deposited by the company, as
ordered by the court earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
