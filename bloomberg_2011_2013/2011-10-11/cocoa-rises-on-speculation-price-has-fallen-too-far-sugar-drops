Cocoa climbed in  London  on
speculation the price has fallen too far after the commodity
retreated 7.3 percent in the past month. Sugar and coffee slid
as commodities declined.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-short positions, or bets that prices will fall, both
in London and New York cocoa. Commodities slid on concern’s
 Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials fell as much as 1.1 percent.  “Chicago wheat, cocoa and soy meal are the most heavily
oversold relative to historical net spec positions,” Paul Deane, an economist at  Australia  & New Zealand Banking Group,
wrote in a report e-mailed today.  Cocoa for December delivery climbed 0.3 percent to 1,712
pounds ($2,674) a ton by 9:57 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
Cocoa for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to $2,652 a ton on
ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Net-short positions on cocoa fell by 376 contracts, or 12
percent, in the week ended Oct. 4 from a week earlier on ICE
Futures U.S., according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. In London, money managers cut their net-short
by 626 contracts, or 11 percent, from a week earlier, data from
NYSE Liffe showed.  Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology atmospheric indicators
continue to hover around la Nina thresholds. The weather
conditions, if formed, are likely to be weaker than in 2010-11,
it said. La Nina helped boost crops to a record in top producer
 Ivory Coast  and second-ranking Ghana last season.  Philippines Exports  White, or refined, sugar for December delivery fell 1.9
percent to $667.40 a ton in London. Raw sugar for March delivery
slid 1.8 percent to 25.80 cents a pound in New York.  The  Philippines  expects to export a total 600,000 tons of
sugar to the U.S. and other markets in the current crop year,
the Sugar Regulatory Administration said in an e-mailed
statement today. Local sugar inventory is at more than 200,000
tons as of October, which will be enough to cover demand for
this month and next, the state agency said.  Robusta coffee for November delivery retreated $36, or 1.8
percent, to $1,916 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Arabica coffee for
December delivery was down 0.5 percent at $2.252 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
