Serbia ’s parliamentary speaker said
it would be no surprise if national elections are called before
March because it is evident that campaigning has already begun.  “Strictly speaking, elections need to be called by March
11 at the latest and held by May 11,” Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic
told reporters in parliament in Belgrade today. “But I won’t be
surprised if it happens sooner.”  It will be up to politicians to decide whether a six-month
election campaign is what Serbia needs, she said, adding it
makes no difference to her whether the vote is held in December,
January or March. Under the constitution, the president must
disband parliament and call elections.  The Cabinet of Prime Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic , representing
a coalition of three main parties and a dozen smaller groups, is
the first to last its full term since pro-Western and reform-
oriented parties ousted  Slobodan Milosevic  in 2000.  President Boris Tadic dismissed opposition calls earlier
this year for early elections, arguing that an early vote was
not in the country’s best interest ahead of an European
Commission opinion on whether the nation has made sufficient
efforts to qualify for membership talks. The Commission will
unveil its decision tomorrow around noon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
