Siemens AG (SIE) , the European engineering
company rocked by a bribery scandal in 2006 and 2007, said it
replaced the head of its Brazilian subsidiary with immediate
effect because of compliance violations.  The German company, based in Munich, named Paulo Ricardo Stark to succeed Adilson Antonio Primo, according to a statement
today. An internal investigation had uncovered “a serious
violation of Siemens guidelines occurred within Siemens Brazil
prior to 2007,” the company said.  Chief Executive Officer Peter Loescher stepped up internal
compliance at Siemens after a bribery scandal that haunted the
company for years, cost about $3.2 billion and felled two of his
predecessors. Siemens was investigated in at least a dozen
countries, in the biggest bribery case in post-war  Germany .  For decades, Siemens had paid kickbacks and bribes to win
contracts such as a commuter rail project in Venezuela, mobile-
phone networks in Bangladesh, power plants in Israel and
traffic-control systems in Russia. Siemens in 2008 agreed to pay
$1.6 billion to settle probes in the U.S. and Germany.  Siemens, which ousted more than 600 employees from 2007 to
2009 for faults linked to compliance, investigated almost 2,200
possible violations in the wake of the scandal. The number was
lower last year, according to  Peter Solmssen , the board member
responsible for compliance at Siemens.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
