Ethanol gained the most in three
months as corn prices surged the most in more than a year.  The biofuel gained 4.4 percent in  Chicago  after the
Department of Agriculture reported U.S. exporters sold 261,200
metric tons of corn to  Mexico , the world’s second-biggest buyer
after  Japan . Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7
billion last year, USDA data show.  “With corn being limit-up today, that had the biggest
correlation to ethanol,” Chris Wilson, an economic analyst at
First Capitol Risk Management in Galena,  Illinois , said in a
telephone interview.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 11 cents to
settle at $2.63 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. It was
the largest gain since July 5.  Corn futures for December delivery climbed the exchange
limit of 40 cents, or 6.6 percent, to $6.45 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest advance since June 2010.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 4.5
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.835 a gallon, and on the West Coast
the biofuel added 4 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.845, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 3.5 cents, or 1.3 percent,
to $2.775 a gallon, and in Chicago the additive climbed 5 cents,
or 1.9 percent, to $2.69, Bloomberg data show.  Gasoline for November delivery gained 5.23 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $2.7476 a gallon in New York. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
