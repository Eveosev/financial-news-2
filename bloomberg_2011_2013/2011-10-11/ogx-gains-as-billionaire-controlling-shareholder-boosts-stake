OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA
rose to a two-week high in Sao Paulo trading after the oil-
exploration company’s controlling shareholder, Brazilian
billionaire  Eike Batista , said he will increase his stake.  OGX rose 31 centavos, or 3.4 percent, to 12.32 reais at
11:55 a.m. New York time, more than the 1 percent rise in the
Bovespa index. Earlier, the stock climbed to 12.35 reais, the
highest since Sept. 27. OGX is the second-biggest gainer on the
Bovespa today, after LLX Logistica SA, Batista’s logistics
company.  Batista bought 545 million reais ($311 million) of
structured notes that can be converted into OGX shares, which
will boost his stake in the Rio de Janeiro-based company to 62.5
percent from 61 percent, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday. The stock has fallen 38 percent this year after the
company postponed the start of oil output to as late as December
from the middle of the year because of delays receiving a
production platform.  OGX has had 100 percent success exploring for oil in
 Brazil ’s Campos Basin and aims to reach output of 750,000
barrels a day in 2015. OGX has oil assets in Brazil and  Colombia 
and plans to buy additional exploration areas in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story
