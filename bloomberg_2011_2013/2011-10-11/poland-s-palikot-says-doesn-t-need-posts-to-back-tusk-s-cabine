Janusz Palikot, the former vodka
distiller whose Palikot Movement will be the third-largest party
in  Poland ’s parliament after winning 10 percent of the vote in
Oct. 9 elections, said today he’s ready to back incumbent Prime
Minister Donald Tusk’s government without joining the cabinet.  The only condition for the Palikot Movement supporting Tusk
is for the latter to appoint non-party experts to head some
ministries in the new government, Palikot told reporters at a
news conference in Warsaw.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
