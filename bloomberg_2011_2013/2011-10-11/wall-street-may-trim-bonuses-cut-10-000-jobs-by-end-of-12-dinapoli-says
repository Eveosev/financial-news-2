Wall Street may give out smaller
bonuses for the second straight year and shed almost 10,000 jobs
by the end of 2012 as Europe’s debt crisis slows the economy,
New York Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said.  Member firms of the New York Stock Exchange earned $9.3
billion in the first quarter, about half of the $20 billion  New
York City  projected they’d earn for all of 2011. Since then,
profits have dropped sharply and are unlikely to reach $18
billion for the year, DiNapoli said in a  report  today.  “The securities industry had a strong start to 2011, but
its prospects have cooled considerably for the second half,”
DiNapoli said. “It now seems likely that profits will fall
sharply, job losses will continue, and bonuses will be smaller
than last year.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is down about 5.5 percent
this year after gaining 12.8 percent in 2010. Stocks retreated
today on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen.  After adding 9,900 jobs between January 2010 and April
2011, the securities industry shed 4,100 positions through
August and may lose another 10,000 by the end of 2012, DiNapoli
said. Each job gained or lost in the industry creates or
eliminates three other jobs in New York City and state, he said.  Salary Disparity  The biggest global banks are trimming jobs the fastest
since 2008 as companies seek to improve profitability,
regulators boost  capital requirements  and a weakening economy
squeezes revenue. Firms have announced more than 120,000 cuts
this year, while hiring in some markets or businesses, data
compiled by Bloomberg Industries show.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest U.S. lender by assets,
said Sept. 12 it will eliminate 30,000 jobs in the next few
years under a project to remove about $5 billion in annual
costs.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said in July that it will cut
about 1,000 jobs after its second-quarter drop in trading
revenue was bigger than analysts estimated.  More Wall Street finance professionals expect bonuses to
fall than rise over the next three years, according to an
eFinancialCareers.com survey released yesterday. About 80
percent of the 1,098 people who responded to the e-mailed query
in the U.S. said they don’t expect bigger bonuses over the next
three years, with 46 percent expecting them to shrink.  In 2010, the average salary in the securities industry rose
16.1 percent to $361,330, 5.5 times higher than the average
private-industry salary, DiNapoli said. The industry accounted
for 23.5 percent of all wages paid by businesses while making up
5.3 percent of jobs.  Tax Contribution  Wall Street  contributed about 7 percent of city tax revenue
in fiscal 2011, almost half of the prerecession level of 13
percent, according to DiNapoli. The comptroller said one in
eight jobs in the city, and one in 13 in the state, is
associated with Wall Street.  Shrinking bonuses and a smaller securities industry
workforce threaten New York state’s and New York City’s tax
haul, DiNapoli said.  “Given the current weakness, collections are likely to
fall short of city and state targets in their current fiscal
years and may decline by more the following year,” DiNapoli’s
statement said.  The state’s budget deficit estimate for fiscal year 2013 is
now $2.4 billion, up from a $2 billion gap projected earlier
this year when the Legislature approved the 2012 budget,
DiNapoli said on former Governor  David Paterson ’s daily talk
show on NewsTalk Radio 710.  DiNapoli said he added the $400 million to the deficit
“upon factoring in what’s happening on Wall Street.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
