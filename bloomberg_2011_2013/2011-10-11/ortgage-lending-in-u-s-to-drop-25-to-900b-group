Home lending in the U.S. will
probably decline 25 percent to $900 billion next year, according
to an estimate from the  Mortgage Bankers Association .  Lower refinancing activity will drive the drop, while loans
for home purchases will be little changed at about $400 billion
as property sales remain subdued, the trade group said today in
a statement released at its annual conference in Chicago.  The association has predicted declines in refinancing
activity for three years because of its forecasts of rising
 interest rates ,  Jay Brinkmann , its chief economist, told
reporters in a presentation. The average rate on a typical 30-
year mortgage instead fell to a record low 3.94 percent last
week, according to housing-finance firm  Freddie Mac , reflecting
lower bond yields amid concern Europe’s sovereign crisis will
spread and the Federal Reserve’s latest debt-buying plan.  “One of these years, I guess we’ll get it right,”
Brinkmann said. “It’s really difficult to forecast interest
rates in this environment” because of the Fed’s involvement in
the  debt market , which has been intended to spur growth and
support housing.  At its annual conference a year ago, the Washington-based
Mortgage Bankers Association predicted $996 billion of home-loan
originations this year, which would have been the lowest amount
since 1996. It now forecasts $1.2 trillion for 2011. Lending
totaled $1.6 trillion last year, after peaking at about $4
trillion in 2003, according to the group’s data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
