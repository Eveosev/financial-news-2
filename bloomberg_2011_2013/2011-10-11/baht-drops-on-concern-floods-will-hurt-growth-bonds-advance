Thailand ’s baht fell, reversing
earlier gains, on concern the nation’s worst floods in more than
half a century will erode economic growth.  Government bonds  rose.  Thailand’s exports may expand at a slower pace in the
fourth quarter partly as floods disrupt manufacturing and
transportation, the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce
said. The  finance ministry  slashed its growth forecast for the
economy yesterday after flooding forced companies including
Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s third-largest automaker, and the
world’s two biggest makers of high-end cameras, Canon Inc. and
Nikon Corp., to suspend production.  “With the closure of factories and halting of production,
there’s concern floods will not only hurt the export outlook but
also the employment situation,” said Tohru Nishihama, an
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .
“You don’t want to buy the baht now.”  The baht dropped 0.3 percent to 30.96 per dollar as of 3:46
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency earlier touched 30.82, the strongest level since Sept.
23, after data from the Thai Bond Market Association showed
global funds bought $157 million more Thai government notes than
they sold in the last two days.  Thailand’s economy will expand 3.7 percent this year, the
finance ministry said yesterday. That compares with a range of
3.8 percent to 4.3 percent forecast last month.  The yield on the government’s 5.25 percent bonds due May
2014 dropped eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to
3.41 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
rose to 104.482 from 104.281 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
