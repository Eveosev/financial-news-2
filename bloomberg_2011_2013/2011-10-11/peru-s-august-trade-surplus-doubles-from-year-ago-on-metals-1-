Peru’s trade surplus more than
doubled in August from the same month a year earlier as rising
copper, gold and coffee prices drove exports to a record.  The Andean country posted a trade surplus of $1.16 billion
in August, compared with $448 million a year ago and $1.25
billion in July, the country’s National Statistics Institute
said today in an e-mailed report.  Exports climbed 54 percent to $4.53 billion. Imports rose
35 percent to $3.4 billion, led by crude oil, soybean,
automobiles and televisions, the agency said.  The Peruvian sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7300 per  U.S.
dollar  at 11:02 a.m. in  New York , from 2.7280 yesterday.  The nation’s trade surplus will probably fall to $4.3
billion next year from $7.4 billion this year because of lower
metal prices, central bank President Julio Velarde said Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
