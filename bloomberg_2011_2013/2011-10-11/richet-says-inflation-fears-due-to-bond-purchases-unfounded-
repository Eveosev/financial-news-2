European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said fears that the bank’s government bond
purchases may create price pressures are “totally unfounded.”  “The purchase of Treasuries on the secondary market, is
not at all a quantitative easing programme. We are rigorously
withdrawing all the liquidity which is provided,” Trichet said
in an interview with  Germany ’s Welt newspaper to be published
tomorrow. “We are fully credible to deliver  price stability 
over the next 10 years, according to observers and market
participants,” he added, according to a transcript provided by
the ECB.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
