Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the United Arab
Emirates’ biggest construction company by market value, had its
price estimate cut 14 percent at Deutsche Bank AG.  “Arabtec’s year-to-date new orders have been light while
margin compression has been sharp, which we believe is the new
reality as competition increases,” analyst Athmane Benzerroug
wrote in a report to clients dated yesterday. “In the near
term, we neither see margin upturn nor significant improvement
in backlog.”  The price estimate was reduced to 1.2 dirhams from 1.4
dirhams with a “hold” recommendation at the bank.  Deutsche Bank said it continues to prefer  Drake & Scull
International (DSI)  over Arabtec because of “strong backlog growth,
healthier balance sheet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
