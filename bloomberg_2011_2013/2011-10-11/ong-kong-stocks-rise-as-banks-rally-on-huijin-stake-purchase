raising its share of ownership, and I think that’s a very
positive signal, not just for the banking sector but more
broadly for the global economy,” said  Philip Poole , global head
of macro and investments strategy at HSBC Global Asset
Management. “What’s most important for markets is to stabilize
sentiment.”  The Hang Seng Index sank 21 percent this year, making it
the worst performing developed-market benchmark index outside

measures and Europe’s debt crisis will derail global growth.  Companies on the index traded at 9.7 times forecast

together to be more supportive for the markets,” said HSBC’s
