Uganda ’s shilling headed for the
weakest closing level in 18 years as manufacturers bought
dollars to import raw materials.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy
depreciated 0.9 percent, the most in a week, to 2,890 at 1:05
p.m. in the capital, Kampala. A close at this level would be the
weakest since at least June 1993, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We are seeing dollar demand in the  interbank market ,”
Faisal Bukenya, the head of currency trading at Barclays Bank
Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “The banks are trying
to fulfill underlying demand and we have seen the manufacturing
sector aggressively buying the dollar.”  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee exporter has
slipped 20 percent this year to the dollar, making it the
second-worst performer after Kenya’s shilling, which has dropped
23 percent. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to
a more than 18-year high of 28.3 percent in September from 22
percent in August, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said on Sept.
