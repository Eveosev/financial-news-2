Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said
his decision to return to the presidency next year will
strengthen Russia’s political system.  “The decision that we took with Medvedev is absolutely
right and won’t weaken but will strengthen the system of
government in Russia,” Putin said in an interview with Chinese
state media in Beijing today. “We are counting on the support
of the electorate.”  Putin, 59, said on Sept. 24 he’ll seek to return to the
presidency in March elections, pushing aside his protege,  Dmitry Medvedev , who replaced him in the Kremlin for four years because
of a constitutional ban on three consecutive presidential terms.  Two more six-year terms would give Putin 24 years as
Russia’s head of state, making him the longest-serving leader
since the Soviet Union’s  Josef Stalin .  To contact the reporters on this story:
