Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, rose 44 percent in
the second half of September, industry association Unica said.  Output climbed to 2.84 million metric tons in the last two
weeks of the month, from 1.97 million tons in the year-earlier
period, Unica said in an e-mailed statement today.  Cane growers in the Center South, where about 90 percent of
the country’s sugar and ethanol is produced, harvested 36.7
million tons, up 35 percent from the 27.2 million tons reaped a
year earlier.  Ethanol output rose 7.7 percent to 1.62 billion liters (427
million gallons) in the period.  Mills in the region processed 52 percent of the cane into
sugar, up from 45 percent in the year-earlier period. The rest
was processed into ethanol.  In the harvest so far, growers have produced 26 million
tons of sugar and 17 billion liters of ethanol, a decrease of
4.2 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Sugar-cane output has
dropped 7.4 percent to 412 million tons, Unica said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
