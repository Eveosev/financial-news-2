Gold futures fell from a two-week
high as traders awaited a vote by Slovakian lawmakers on the
euro region’s retooled bailout package.  Slovakia is the only country that hasn’t agreed to the
enhanced European bailout fund. Gold prices surged to a record
$1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6 as  Europe ’s escalating debt crisis
boosted demand for a haven. The metal then tumbled, falling 11
percent last month, as increasing risks to global growth
prompted investors to sell most commodities.  “It’s not clear yet whether gold will behave like a
commodity or as a safe-haven investment once the bailout package
is announced,” Jon Nadler , an analyst at Kitco Inc. in
 Montreal , said in telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery declined 0.6 percent to
settle at $1,661 at 1:58 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . Earlier,
the metal reached $1,686.70, the highest since Sept. 23.  Prices also fell today as a stronger dollar eroded demand
for the metal as an alternative. The greenback rose as much as
0.6 percent against a basket of six major currencies.  “We are seeing profit taking ahead of the Slovakia
voting,” David Meger, the director of metal trading at Vision
Financial Markets in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“The strength in dollar is also pushing gold down.”  Silver futures for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$31.998 an ounce. The metal climbed 3.2 percent yesterday.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery dropped 0.4 percent to $1,518.80 an ounce,
declining for the second time in three sessions. Palladium
futures for December delivery retreated 1.6 percent to $604.30
an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
