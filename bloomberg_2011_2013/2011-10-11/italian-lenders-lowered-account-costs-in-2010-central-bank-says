The cost of holding and managing
bank accounts in  Italy  fell 3 percent in 2010 as clients reduced
transactions and lenders cut charges, the  Bank of Italy  said.  The average cost declined to 110.20 euros ($149.9) from
113.6 euros in 2009, the Rome-based central bank said today in a
report based on a survey on 11,114 clients at 176 banks. Almost
59 percent of costs consisted of fixed fees, 25 percent of
variable fees and the remaining 16 percent of overdraft charges,
the report showed.  The decline “was due to lower charges for managing
securities, interest payments, mailing bank statements and other
communications” as well as fewer transactions by clients, the
central bank said. The drop “did not affect some important
kinds of fixed charges, such as the annual fee, or variable
ones, such as the cost of wire transfers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
