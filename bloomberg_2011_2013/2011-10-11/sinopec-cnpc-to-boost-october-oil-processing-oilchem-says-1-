China Petrochemical Corp. and China
National Petroleum Corp., the nation’s biggest refiners, will
increase daily oil processing by 4.5 percent this month from
September, according to Oilchem.net.  The state-controlled refiners will process as much as 30.5
million metric tons of crude, or 979,000 tons daily, Oilchem.net
reported today, citing a survey of 66 plants with a combined
capacity of 440 million tons a year compiled by the Shandong-
based industry  website . That’s equivalent to about 7.2 million
barrels a day.  Sinopec Group, as China Petrochemical is known, will
process 573,000 tons a day, down 0.2 percent from September,
while CNPC will refine 406,000 tons daily, up 12 percent, as
plants reopen after maintenance, Oilchem.net said.  Processing volumes will rebound “noticeably” next month
after Sinopec Group starts the Jiujiang and Luoyang plants after
repairs, according to Oilchem.net.  --Jing Yang, Winnie Zhu. Editors: Ryan Woo, Christian Schmollinger.  To contact the reporters on this story:
