Late last month, the Hindu newspaper published  an interview  with Parveena Ahangar, the chairperson of an organization with one of the strangest and saddest names: the  Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons in Kashmir . The persons who "disappeared," now numbering in the thousands, were all Kashmiri youths. Picked up by the police or the Indian Army over the last two decades, they were never seen again, and remain alive in public memory only because of the collective will of their grieving parents. For years, the parents of the disappeared have tried not to make the traumatic connection between their missing sons and unofficial reports of bodies buried secretly, sometimes by the dozen, by Indian security forces after "encounters" with alleged militants in the  restive, unhappy and highly militarized Kashmir Valley . In turn, the Indian state denied that it killed anybody other than militants, and insisted that the missing had escaped across the Kashmiri border into Pakistan. But in August, after years of pressure from reports circulated by the  parents' association  and the  International People’s Tribunal on Human Rights , the Indian state was  forced to acknowledge  for the first time that there were more than 2,000 unidentified people buried in mass graves at different sites in Kashmir. Many of them had been labeled as "foreign militants," but the  Jammu and Kashmir  State Human Rights Commission said that more than 500 bodies had been identified by Kashmiri family members. The Indian Express reported: Held since 1947 by India as its only Muslim-majority state, Kashmir is claimed by  Pakistan , and has been wracked since 1990 by a violent insurgency, partly sponsored by Pakistan, that has matured over the years into a  homegrown intifada  -- the word is  used self-consciously  by Kashmiris -- that has largely abandoned the use of guns in an effort to distinguish itself from the bloodshed of the past. The disclosure of the mass graves, corroborated by several  macabre interviews  with undertakers in Kashmiri newspapers, was an  embarrassment  to both the Indian government and to the government of the state, which is run by the "pro-India" National Conference but effectively concedes power on the ground to the Indian Army. But the real constituency for whom these reports should act as an eye-opener is the 1 billion or so Indian citizens in the rest of the country, most of whom have never been to Kashmir, understand its problems through the distorted lens of the mainstream national media, and maintain a narrowly nationalist position toward Kashmiri demands for azadi, or independence. For instance, when  Arundhati Roy , the Indian writer and dissident, publicly backed the Kashmiri demand for independence last October, the response from the BJP, the main opposition party in Parliament, was to  demand Roy's arrest  and declare that "anyone speaking against  India  should be hanged." The arrogance and hubris of that statement is shared by a large section of Indian opinion, and badly needs puncturing. Very simply, no state can call itself a democracy that has kept such a large number of its citizens captive in a state of a permanent emergency for so long and that, as the reports on mass graves prove, has nurtured so many murky secrets. As much for the legitimacy of its own self-image as a democratic citizenry as out of sympathy for the rights of Kashmiris, Indian public opinion needs to ask harder questions of the government about the efficacy of the approach to the Kashmir issue. The public also needs to interrogate (and perhaps force to be rescinded) the laws and statutes that have allowed India to behave, effectively, like a police state in the northernmost corner of its domain, even as it works with evident pride to refine and improve democratic functioning elsewhere in the country. Most draconian among these legal exceptions is an emergency law called the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, or AFSPA, which has been in place in Kashmir for more than 20 years and gives the military the kind of authority that it might enjoy in a police state. As the Kashmiri writer Basharat Peer, who wrote a  striking essay  last year describing the Kashmiri experience of the Indian occupation, explained in a piece on the issue of mass graves in  Foreign Policy : This explains why women such as  Parveena Ahangar , who have lost their sons to the long dark night of the hydra-headed insurgency-occupation-independence movement, continued last month to insist that the official acknowledgment of mass graves was of no utility unless it resulted in changes in the law. On Sept. 26,  Vinay Kumar  reported  in the Hindu : So Ahangar would have been heartened to hear about the  cross-country rally  to protest against the AFSPA, starting in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, on Oct. 16. It will end 11 days later more than 3,000 kilometers (1,800 miles) away in north-eastern Manipur, another state where the Act is in force and has been  misused  to blur the line between insurgents and dissenters. A workable template for what may serve as a vision of political justice in Kashmir has for more than six decades eluded India, Pakistan, and the  United Nations , largely because of the self-interest and caprice of the two great powers of the subcontinent. But in the meantime, Kashmiris would surely appreciate if the state demonstrated a commitment to justice at least in the legal sense of the word. The abandonment of this value, building up over the years, has resulted in the dreadful and damning testimony of the bones and skulls in mass graves in 2011.
