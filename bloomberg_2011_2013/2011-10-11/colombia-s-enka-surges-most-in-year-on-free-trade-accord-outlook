Enka de Colombia SA (ENKA) , a Medellin-
based synthetic fibers producer, rose the most in a year as
investors bet the company will benefit from pending free trade
deals with the U.S., the European Union and South Korea.  Shares rose 13 percent to 12.2 pesos at 3 p.m. Bogota time,
the steepest advance since October 2010.  “Enka exports a lot to Europe and  Asia , including
shipments of fish nets and tires,” said Jorge Zuniga, analyst
at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest brokerage. “With all the
free trade accords on the table, the company is going benefit.”  Leaders in the U.S. House and Senate plan to hold votes
Oct. 12 on three bills that would implement trade agreements
including with  Colombia .  Colombia plans to sign a free trade agreement with the
European Union in April and finish negotiating a trade deal with
South Korea this year, according to e-mailed statements last
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
