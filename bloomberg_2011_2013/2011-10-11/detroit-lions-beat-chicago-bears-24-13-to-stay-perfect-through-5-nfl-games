The  Detroit Lions  beat the  Chicago 
Bears 24-13 to stay perfect through five National Football
League games, their best start to the season in 55 years.  The Lions scored two second-half touchdowns last night
while limiting Chicago to one field goal after trailing 10-7 at
halftime in  Detroit ’s first Monday night game in 10 years.  The Lions haven’t had a better start to the season since
they went 6-0 in 1956. Following a 24-20 loss to Chicago on Dec.
5, Detroit has won nine straight games, the longest active
streak in the league and the first time the team has won that
many games in a row since 1953-1954. The turnaround comes three
years after Detroit became the only team in NFL history to fail
to win in a 16-game regular season.  Calvin Johnson put the home team ahead in the second
quarter at Ford Field in Detroit when he caught a 73-yard
scoring pass from Matthew Stafford. Robbie Gould cut the deficit
with a 44-yard field goal and Chicago took the lead 71 seconds
before halftime when quarterback  Jay Cutler  connected with
Kellen Davis on a 9-yard scoring play.  Stafford found Brandon Pettigrew with an 18-yard touchdown
pass in the third quarter to make it 14-10 for the Lions.  Less than five minutes later, no Chicago defender managed
to lay a finger on Jahvid Best as he sprinted 88 yards for the
second-longest scoring run in franchise history behind Bob
Hoernschemeyer’s 96-yard dash against the New York Yanks on Nov.
23, 1950. It was also the second-longest rushing touchdown ever
surrendered by the Bears.  Field Goals  Gould’s second field goal of the game, from 49 yards, cut
the deficit to eight points with 4:07 to play and Jason Hanson
completed the scoring with a 31-yard field goal for Detroit with
just under two minutes remaining.  The  Green Bay Packers  are the only other undefeated team in
the league, while the Bears drop to 2-3 with their second road
loss of the year.  The Lions next face the  San Francisco 49ers  on Oct. 16,
while the Bears play the  Minnesota Vikings  the same day.  San
Francisco  has won three straight games, while the Vikings two
days ago beat the Arizona Cardinals 34-10 to improve to 1-4 and
avoid matching their worst start to the season, set in 1962.  To contact the reporter on this story:
