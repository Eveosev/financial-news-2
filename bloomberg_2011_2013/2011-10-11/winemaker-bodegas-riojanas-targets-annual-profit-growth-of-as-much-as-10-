Bodegas Riojanas SA (RIO) , a Spanish
producer of Rioja wine founded in 1890, expects full-year
earnings to climb from a year earlier as promotions and lower
operating costs offset a battered domestic market.  The Cenicero, Spain-based company may report net income
growth of between 5 percent and 10 percent, Chairman Luis Zapatero said in a telephone interview today. Last year’s profit
climbed about 6 percent to 700,000 euros ($952,000) on sales of
15.3 million euros.  “The second half is going to be clearly better than the
first half, which was a bit negative,” Zapatero, 76, said. “We
especially forecast an increase in the fourth quarter according
to the data we have now.” During the first half, sales dropped
13 percent and profit sank 18 percent.  The company’s promotions and marketing efforts to woo
Spanish consumers hit by the highest unemployment in  Europe  have
pushed wine prices down more than 15 percent in the industry,
Zapatero said, adding that his company is within the average.
The impact on profitability has been offset by higher volumes
and cost cuts across the board, he added.  About 85 percent of the company’s sales come from its Rioja
wines, which include Vina Albina and Monte Real. Vina Albina
reserve costs about 14 euros in a store. In  Spain , reserve wines
are kept for a minimum of three years before being sold.  Even as Bodegas Riojanas targets full-year growth, “the
Spanish market remains weak,” Zapatero said. “The financial
situation both in Spain and Europe is worrisome.”  Bodegas Riojanas shares have dropped 17 percent this year
to 5.90 euros, valuing the company at 32.1 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
