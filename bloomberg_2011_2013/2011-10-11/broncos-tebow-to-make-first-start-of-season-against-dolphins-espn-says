Denver Broncos quarterback  Tim Tebow 
will make his first start of the season on Oct. 23 against the
 Miami Dolphins , ESPN reported citing unidentified players on the
team.  The Broncos have been told that Tebow, 24, will start for
the team following its bye week, ESPN said. Tebow replaced
starter Kyle Orton in the third quarter of the Broncos’ 29-24
loss to the San Diego Chargers last weekend, running for a
touchdown and throwing for another score.  Broncos spokesman Patrick Smyth said coach John Fox will
address the quarterback situation later today.  Tebow played in nine games last year, his rookie season in
the  National Football League , when he completed 50 percent of
his passes and combined for 11 touchdowns rushing and passing.
He was 1-2 as a starter in the team’s final three games.  Tebow helped the University of  Florida  to two Southeastern
Conference titles and two national championships in four
seasons, and graduated as the only player in college football
history to rush for 20 touchdowns and throw for 20 touchdowns in
the same season. The Dolphins will honor the 2008 Gators’
national championship team at halftime of their game against the
Broncos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
