U.S. Gulf crude premiums increased
as the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent
widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent November contracts increased
$1.38 to $24.92 a barrel in  New York . The spread settled Sept. 6
at a record margin of $26.87.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened $1.10 to
$28.35 a barrel at 4:11 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained $1.80 to
$28.05.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend grew 85 cents to $24.10 a barrel while Poseidon
strengthened 90 cents to $23.65 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased $1.25 to $23 a
barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to 70
cents a barrel below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium increased 40
cents to $26.50 above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $8.80 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 80 cents to
$10 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
