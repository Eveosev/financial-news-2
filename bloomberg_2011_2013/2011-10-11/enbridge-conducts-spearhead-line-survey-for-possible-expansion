Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  is conducting survey
work along the Spearhead crude oil pipeline in Will County,
 Illinois , to gather information for potential expansions and
maintenance, according to a company spokeswoman.  “If such a market-driven expansion or an integrity
maintenance project moves forward, we will make formal
announcements and begin a detailed consultation and regulatory
review process,” Lorraine Little, an Enbridge spokeswoman,
wrote in an e-mail. “At this point, however, we are merely
gathering survey and environmental information,”  Enbridge is considering expansions to its main crude oil
pipelines totaling about $3 billion, including a project called
Flanagan South, Steve Wuori, president of liquids pipelines at
Enbridge, said at an Oct. 4 conference in Toronto.  The 650-mile Spearhead, which runs to Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
from Flanagan, Illinois, has an average annual capacity of
190,000 barrels a day, according to a company  website .  The line “goes down to Cushing, probably paralleling our
existing Spearhead Pipeline that now moves crude to Cushing,”
he said.  Enbridge began shipping Western Canadian crude through
Spearhead to Cushing, the delivery point for New York Mercantile
Exchange oil futures, in 2006, after reversing the flow of the
line.  “The flows over the Spearhead pipeline have become a
critically important connection between the Midwest and the
Midcontinent markets,” analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led
by  David Greely  in New York, said Oct. 4 in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
