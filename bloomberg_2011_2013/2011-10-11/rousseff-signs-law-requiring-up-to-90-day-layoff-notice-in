Brazil â€™s President  Dilma Rousseff 
signed a law requiring employers to give up to 90 days notice
before firing workers.  The rule, approved by Congress last month, obliges
companies to give employees three additional days of notice on
top of the current mandatory 30 days for every year they have
worked at the company up to a maximum of 90 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
