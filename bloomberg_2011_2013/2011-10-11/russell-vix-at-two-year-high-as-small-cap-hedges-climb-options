The cost of options to protect
against losses in smaller U.S. companies has risen to a two-year
high against Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts on concern
they will fare worse should the economic slowdown intensify.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Russell 2000  Volatility
Index is priced 12.60 points higher than the CBOE Volatility
Index, or VIX, which tracks contracts on the S&P 500. That’s the
most since the record 12.84 points set in April 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap has widened from this
year’s low of 2.93 on July 13.  Analysts cut profit projections for Russell 2000 companies
this year on concern they are more vulnerable to slowing U.S.
growth because they derive less revenue from outside the
country, said  Barry Ritholtz , who oversees about $300 million as
chief executive officer of New York-based FusionIQ. Russell 2000
Index stocks, with a median market capitalization of $431
million, have lost 19 percent since July 22, compared with an 11
percent loss in the  S&P 500 , where the value is $10.5 billion.  “Small caps have the least ability to absorb the
punches,” Ritholtz said during a telephone interview on Oct. 7.
“They tend not to be global, they tend to be more concentrated
in a sector or industry, and are more dependent on a single
product.”  ‘Everything Necessary’  The options index for the Russell 2000 fell 5.6 percent to
45.62 yesterday, while the S&P 500 derivatives gauge dropped 8.8
percent to 33.02, after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
European leaders will do “everything necessary” to ensure that
banks have adequate capital. On average during the past eight
years, the Russell index has been 6.54 points higher than the
S&P 500 gauge, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Russell 2000 VIX fell 2.7 percent to 44.37 today, while
the VIX declined 0.5 percent to 32.86.  The Russell 2000 has surged 12 percent and the S&P 500 has
risen 8.7 percent since Oct. 3, the biggest rallies over the
same amount of time since 2009, on optimism European leaders
will take action to end the crisis. The small-cap index has done
worse in 2011 than the large-company measure, dropping 13
percent versus a 5 percent drop.  Analysts have raised 2011 earnings estimates for the S&P
500 by 4.8 percent since the start of the year and reduced them
by 10 percent for the Russell 2000, according to average
projections compiled by Bloomberg. For 2012, they increased
forecasts by 3.6 percent for the large-stock measure and cut
them by 2.6 percent for the small-company gauge, the data show.  “Small-cap stocks tend to be viewed by asset allocators as
a higher-risk asset class,” Chip Miller, the U.S. small-cap
equity strategist at UBS AG in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a
telephone interview yesterday. “Their earnings are more
volatile, and they tend to be more economically sensitive.”  More Growth  Even after analysts cut projections, they see Russell 2000
companies posting 38 percent and 40 percent earnings growth in
2011 and 2012, according to the average estimates. That’s double
and triple the projected rates for the S&P 500, the data show.
For  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index, the forecast for next
year’s growth is 19 percent.  “People hear ‘small’ and immediately think high-risk,
which is a very naive way to look at the market,”  Dan Veru , who
oversees $3.4 billion as chief investment officer at  Fort Lee ,
New Jersey-based Palisade Capital Management LLC, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. “We’re very bullish on small
caps. These stocks have some of the same growth attributes as
emerging-market stocks with a heck of a lot less risk.”  Small caps are less able to endure a global slowdown than
S&P 500 stocks, according to Scott Tapley, who helps oversee
$2.5 billion at 1st Source Investment Advisors Inc. in  South
Bend ,  Indiana .  North American Focus  The median company in the Russell 2000 takes in all of its
revenue from  North America , compared with 74 percent in the S&P
500, financial reports compiled by Bloomberg show. Cash at
Russell 2000 companies represents 32 percent of total debt,
compared with 37 percent for the S&P 500, giving smaller stocks
less of a cushion should the economy contract, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Small caps have more to lose because their balance sheets
are weaker relative to large caps,” Tapley said in a phone
interview yesterday. “I’ve been adding to larger, dividend-
paying, bulletproof multinationals. They’re not going away.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
