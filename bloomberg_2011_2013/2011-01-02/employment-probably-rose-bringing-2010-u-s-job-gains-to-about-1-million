Employment probably rose for a third
month in December, bringing U.S. payroll growth last year to
about 1 million and pointing to further improvement in the labor
market in 2011, economists said before a report this week.  A projected 140,000 gain in December payrolls is the median
forecast of 61 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the
Jan. 7 report from the Labor Department. The unemployment rate
may have eased to 9.7 percent from 9.8 percent. Other reports
may show faster growth at the nation’s factories and service
industries last month.  Bigger employment and income gains may help boost sales at
companies like Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., allowing the expansion to
become well-rooted. Even with the labor market improvement in
2010, it will take years to make up for the 8.4 million jobs
lost during the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  “Things are improving but it’s a gradual momentum that’s
building,” said  Michelle Meyer , a senior economist at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Global Research in  New York . “It all
comes back to the labor market and so far the jobs recovery has
been disappointing.”  Estimates for the increase in December payrolls ranged from
95,000 to 215,000 after a 39,000 rise a month earlier and a
172,000 gain in October.  Private payrolls, which exclude government agencies, rose
by 155,000 last month after a 50,000 November gain, the survey
showed. Including the projected increase for December, companies
added about 1.3 million workers last year, the most since 2006.  Indications the economy is improving and will create the
conditions for further employment growth helped fuel gains in
the stock market last year at the same time companies reported
stronger earnings.  Stocks Surge  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 13 percent in 2010
after a 23 percent jump in 2009, making it the biggest two-year
advance since the Internet-bubble rally of 1998 and 1999.  Even with the pickup in hiring, the jobless rate has shown
few signs of declining. December is forecast to be the 17th
month in which unemployment has been 9.5 percent or higher. For
all of 2010, joblessness likely averaged 9.7 percent, the worst
year since 1982.  States and municipalities with growing budget gaps are
cutting spending and reducing headcount.  Florida  may cut 5
percent of its state workforce to save costs, Governor-elect  Rick Scott  said in an interview Dec. 3 on Bloomberg Television’s
“InBusiness With Margaret Brennan.”  ‘Jobs Go Away’  “Our government has grown too fast compared to the private
sector,” said Scott, 58. “When that happens, jobs go away, so
we have to reduce the size of government.”  High unemployment explains why  Federal Reserve  policy
makers said they need to follow through on their plan to
purchase an additional $600 billion of assets by June.  “The economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate
that has been insufficient to bring down unemployment,” Fed
officials said in a statement after their Dec. 14 policy
meeting. Minutes of the Fed’s Open Market Committee meeting will
be released Jan. 4.  The struggling labor market is also a reason why President  Barack Obama  negotiated an accord with Congress to pass an $858
billion bill extending all Bush-era tax cuts for two years. The
bill also continues expanded unemployment insurance benefits
through 2011 and cuts payrolls taxes by 2 percentage points.  “While it appears that the economic environment has
stabilized and is perhaps improving, persistent high
unemployment and uncertainty in the economy could continue to
pressure consumers and affect their spending,” Steven Temares,
chief executive officer at Union, New Jersey-based Bed Bath &
Beyond, said on a teleconference with analysts Dec. 22. Still,
“we remain cautiously optimistic,” he said.  Holiday Sales  The improvement in the labor market has been enough to
generate more sales for retailers. Holiday purchases jumped 5.5
percent, the best performance since 2005, said MasterCard
Advisors’ SpendingPulse, which measures retail sales by all
payment forms. That compared with a 4.1 percent gain a year
earlier. The numbers include Internet sales and exclude
automobile purchases.  Factories continue at the forefront of the expansion that
began in June 2009, while service industries from finance to
retail and business consulting are improving.  The Tempe, Arizona-based Institute for Supply Management’s
factory index rose to 57 in December, the highest in seven
months, from 56.6 the prior month, economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast the group will report tomorrow. A reading
higher than 50 signals growth.  ISM’s gauge of service industries, which make up about 90
percent of the economy, may rise to 55.7 in December, the
highest since May 2006, from 55, economists forecast before the
Jan. 5 report.
