Treasuries rose, pushing the yield on
the 10-year note to almost record lows, as concern mounted that
a possible Greece exit from the euro may worsen the region’s
debt crisis, boosting haven demand for  U.S. government debt .  Treasuries  remained higher  after a $35 billion sale of
five-year notes drew a record-low auction yield of 0.748
percent, compared with the previous record low of 0.88 percent
in December. The U.S. will sell seven-year debt tomorrow, the
final of three note sales totaling $99 billion. The Federal
Reserve purchased $6.5 billion of securities in two operations
as part of a program to lower borrowing costs.  “Everything is being driven by the flight-to-quality bid
that’s being generated out of the fear and uncertainty around
 Europe ,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New
York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for institutional
investors. “It’s pushing people into the safest and most liquid
assets.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.74 percent at 4:59 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2022 rose 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face amount, to
100 1/8.  Current five-year note yields fell two basis points to 0.73
percent, while 30-year bond yields eased five basis points to
2.82 percent.  Auction Statistics  The auction yield matched the average forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s primary
dealers. Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 42.6 percent of the notes,
compared with an average of 44.4 percent for the past 10 sales.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.99,
versus an average of 2.93 for the previous 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 6.5 percent of
the notes, compared with an average of 12 percent at the last 10
auctions.  “The market rallied all the way into the auction, there
was no concession, and a lot of people were forced to buy ahead
of the auction so the auction results were a little soft,” said
 John Briggs , a U.S. government bond strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , a primary dealer. “With 10-year yields so close to
historical lows and the market being held here due to
uncertainty in Europe, if you don’t have to trade right here,
you don’t trade. You preserve capital for better opportunities
one way or the other.”  Debt Returns  Five-year notes have gained 1.02 percent this year,
matching the gain for the broader Treasury market, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  This week’s note offerings, combined with the May 17
auction of $13 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, will raise $52.9 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.1 billion.  Treasuries rose earlier as European leaders prepared to
meet for a summit in Brussels to address the region’s debt
crisis. The 10-year note yield dropped as low as 1.71 percent,
approaching the record 1.67 percent set on Sept. 23.  The “level to watch” on the 10-year note yield would be
the record low,  Tom Fitzpatrick  and Shyam Devani, technical
strategists at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a research note. “A
breach of that would be a real concern as it would open the way
for the 1.2 percent area.”  German Sale  Refuge from the region’s crisis also drove investor demand
at an auction in  Germany , which received bids for more than the
maximum 5 billion-euro ($6.3 billion) target at a note sale,
with the yield falling to a record.  Germany, the only country in the euro area with a stable
outlook on its AAA rating, sold 4.56 billion euros of two-year
securities carrying a zero-percent coupon for the first time,
Bundesbank data showed today. The securities were sold to yield
0.07 percent. The country offered a fixed interest payment of
0.25 percent when selling similar-maturity notes on April 18.  German 10-year bond yields dropped to a record-low 1.376
percent.  U.K. government yields on two-, five- and 10-year notes
declined to record lows, after  Bank of England  minutes showed
the decision to pause stimulus was a “finely balanced” one for
some policy makers.  The Fed purchased $1.8 billion of Treasuries due from
August 2022 to May 2030 in its first operation today, according
to the Fed Bank of  New York ’s  website . The central bank also
purchased $4.7 billion of securities maturing from May 2018 to
May 2020 in its second operation as part of a program to replace
$400 billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings with longer
maturities to support the economy by keeping down borrowing
costs.  The 10-year rate will be 2.45 percent by year-end, a
Bloomberg survey of banks and securities companies shows, with
the most recent forecasts given the heaviest weighting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
