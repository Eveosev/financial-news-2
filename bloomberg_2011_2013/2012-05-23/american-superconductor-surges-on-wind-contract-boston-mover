American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
supplier of wind-turbine components, rose the most in more than
a month after winning a contract to supply 100 megawatts of
electrical systems to Indiaâ€™s Inox Wind Ltd.  American Superconductor rose 13 percent to $3.99 a share at
the close in  New York , the most since April 11.  Inox designed a two-megawatt wind turbine using American
Superconductor technology in 2009 and today ordered 50 of its
electrical control systems to use in turbines this year, the
Devens, Massachusetts-based company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
