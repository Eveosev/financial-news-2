A rebound in the rate of turnover
among chief executive officers at the world’s largest companies
last year indicates growing confidence about a global recovery,
the Financial Times said, citing a study by Booz & Co.  The study found 355 of the 2,500 biggest companies by
market value, or 14 percent, replaced their CEOs in 2011,
compared with 290 the year before, the newspaper said.
Historically, more companies have tended to stick with their
CEOs during market slumps to avoid the uncertainty created by
hiring a new leader, Booz said, according to the FT.  Booz also found more than 20 percent of CEOs were outside
hires, compared with 14 percent in 2007, the newspaper said.
That’s also a trend that can coincide with emergence from a
recession, the FT said, citing Senior Partner Gary Neilson, one
of the report’s authors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
