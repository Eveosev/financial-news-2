Red Hat Inc. (RHT) , the largest seller of
the open-source Linux operating system, fell after an analyst at
Piper Jaffray & Co. projected a slowdown in billings growth.  The Raleigh, North Carolina-based company declined 3.4
percent to $54.43 at the close in New York, for the third-worst
 performance  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The  stock  has
climbed 32 percent this year.  Billings, a predictor of revenue, “could lack the
explosiveness seen in the fourth quarter,” said  Mark Murphy , an
analyst at Piper Jaffray in  San Francisco , in a note today.
“The macroeconomic climate has degraded since Red Hat issued
guidance in March.”  As Red Hat works to expand its offerings for customers who
want to access data over the Internet using so-called cloud
computing, the company is also dealing with the impact of
fluctuations in foreign currencies and the European debt crisis,
Murphy said. He has an overweight rating on shares, the
equivalent of a buy recommendation, and a target price of $63.  “While billings growth should decelerate this year, we
continue to believe Red Hat is favorably positioned into the
secular trends of cloud computing, open source, virtualization
and unstructured data, and should continue gaining market
share,” Murphy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
