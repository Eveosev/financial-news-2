Monoprix  Tunisia , an affiliate of the
French  supermarket  giant, will open 10 stores in  Libya  by the
end of 2013, after uprisings in both countries further delayed
earlier plans, the companyâ€™s general manager said today.  Work on the 50 million Tunisian dinar ($25.2 million)
project has begun and the first store will open in the Libyan
capital, Tripoli, before the end of the year, Adel Ayed said in
a telephone interview.  Ayed said the company is working with Libyan partner, the
Hosni Bay Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
