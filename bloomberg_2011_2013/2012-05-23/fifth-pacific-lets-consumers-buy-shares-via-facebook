Fifth & Pacific Cos., the apparel
retailer formerly named Liz Claiborne Inc., says customers can
now buy shares in the company via its brands’  Facebook (FB)  pages and
on its website without paying fees.  The New York-based owner of the Kate Spade,  Juicy Couture 
and Lucky Brand labels is the first company to join a social-
media and Web platform developed by Loyal3 Holdings Inc. that
allows consumers to buy stock in their favorite brands with
three clicks, the two companies said in a statement today.  The ownership plan will foster customer loyalty, Fifth &
Pacific Chief Executive Officer Bill McComb said in the
statement. The platform seeks to “democratize” the equities
market, making stock ownership possible for tens of millions of
people, Loyal3 CEO Barry Schneider said.  Fifth & Pacific dropped 0.5 percent to $12.33 at the close
in  New York . The shares have climbed 43 percent this year.  Loyal3, which operates a registered broker dealer Loyal3
Securities Inc., is based in  San Francisco .  To contact the reporter on this story:
