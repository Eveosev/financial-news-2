Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said an exit by Greece from the euro
zone would probably not cause a big setback for the U.S. or
European economies, Reuters reported.  “I’m one that thinks that Greece could exit, and it could
be handled in an appropriate way without causing too much
damage, either in Europe or in the U.S.,” Bullard said,
according to Reuters.  The St. Louis Fed official said he believes the  European
Central Bank  is committed to backing the region’s banking
system, reducing the risks to the U.S. financial system and
economy, the news service reported. Bullard repeated his view
from last week that the Fed may need to raise its target rate in
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
