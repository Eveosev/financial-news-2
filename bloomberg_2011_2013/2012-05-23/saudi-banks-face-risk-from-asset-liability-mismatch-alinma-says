Saudi Arabia ’s banks face the biggest
risk from a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities and
need to find “creative” ways to bridge the gap, the chief
executive officer of  Alinma Bank (ALINMA)  said.  The mismatch needs to be monitored and can be bridged by
issuing long-dated securities like Islamic bonds, Abdulmohsen Al Fares, told reporters at a conference in Riyadh today. Some
foreign banks cut lending in Saudi Arabia after the debt crisis
in Europe which is creating “opportunities for local banks as
well as for others like Asian banks,” he said.  Short-term  demand deposits  make up almost 60 percent of the
kingdom banks’ overall deposits, according to data from the
 Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency . Banks may have to turn to bonds
amid the fastest pick-up in lending to the private sector in
three years. Loans to private businesses grew 13 percent in the
year to March, SAMA data shows.  Saudi Arabia’s banks are benefiting from an increase in
government revenue and spending, which will be the highest ever
this year, and overall bank lending in 2012 should keep pace
with first-quarter loan growth of 10 percent, Al Fares said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
