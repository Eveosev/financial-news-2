Al Arafa Investments & Consulting (AIVC) 
headed for the highest close since March after  Commercial
International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI)  said it may purchase a stake in one
of the clothing exporter’s units.  The shares of Egypt’s biggest publicly traded clothing
maker climbed 5.7 percent to 37 cents, headed for the highest
close since March 12, at 1:41 p.m. in Cairo. The benchmark  EGX
30 Index (EGX30)  gained 0.9 percent.  The country’s biggest publicly traded lender started due
diligence on retail-clothing unit Concrete, Ashraf Khalil, the
bank’s head of investor relations said today.  Al Arafa said in March a “leading” Egyptian bank has
offered to buy 38 percent of Concrete, valuing the unit at 400
million Egyptian pounds ($66 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
