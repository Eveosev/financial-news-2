Ocado Group Plc (OCDO) , the U.K.’s largest
online grocer, rose the most in almost a month in London trading
after saying second-quarter sales growth accelerated and its
automated warehouse is operating at record levels of capacity.  The shares climbed as much as 7.3 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since April 27. They were ahead 1.5 percent to
103.3 pence at 8:43 a.m. Ocado has almost doubled in value this
year.  Sales growth increased 13 percent in the 12 weeks ended May
13, the Hatfield, England-based retailer said today. Revenue had
gained 11 percent in the first quarter. Construction of a second
warehouse in Dordon is on track with testing to start over the
summer, the statement shows.  Ocado  was forced to hire temporary
staff last year and introduced some manual picking of products
as it sought to improve capacity at its automated warehouse.  “Positively, the next major development in Hatfield, a
piece of highly automated picking machinery, has started to go
live,” said Andy Wade, an analyst at Numis Securities with a
buy recommendation. The addition of the second warehouse is
“game-changing,” he added. “We remain confident in the Ocado
business model.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
