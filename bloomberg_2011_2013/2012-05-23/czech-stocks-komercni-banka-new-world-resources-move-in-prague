The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell 0.5 percent to 878.1 at the close in Prague, snapping three
days of gains.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)   retreated 0.9 percent to 3,245
koruna, its lowest in two weeks. Lenders were among the biggest
stock decliners today as concern deepened that European leaders
meeting today won’t contain the region’s debt crisis.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, slumped 2.9 percent to 102 koruna, the lowest in
almost three years. Commodities fell, sending Europe’s benchmark
