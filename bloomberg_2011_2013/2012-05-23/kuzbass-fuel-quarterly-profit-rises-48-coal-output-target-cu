Kuzbass Fuel Co., a Russian producer
of coal for power stations, said first-quarter profit rose by 48
percent as sales increased.  Net income was 888 million rubles ($28.4 million), compared
with 601 million rubles a year earlier, the Kemerovo-based
company said today in a statement. Revenue climbed 27 percent to
6.65 billion rubles.  The company cut its second-quarter output target by 2
percent to 1.88 million metric tons due to unfavorable export
prices, the statement shows. The company expects 2012 revenue
and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization to be at last year’s level.  “Volume demand and possibly prices will be constrained in
most export markets for the remainder of 2012 due to the ongoing
economic turmoil and corresponding contraction of gross domestic
product in the Euro area,” Kuzbass Fuel said.  The company’s first-quarter Ebitda fell 18 percent from the
previous three months to 1.12 billion rubles, Kuzbass fuel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
