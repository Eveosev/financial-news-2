Italian  consumer confidence  plunged
to the lowest in more than 15 years in May as Prime Minister
 Mario Monti ’s austerity drive deepens the recession in  Europe ’s
fourth-biggest economy.  The confidence index fell to 86.5, the lowest since the
data series began in 1996, from a revised 88.8 in April,
national statistics office  Istat  said in Rome today. Economists
forecast a reading of 89.5, according to the median of 12
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Monti is implementing 20 billion euros ($25.5 billion) of
spending cuts and tax increases to fight the debt crisis,
measures that have brought record gasoline prices and helped
push the economy into its fourth recession since 2001.  Italy ’s
economy will shrink 1.5 percent this year as corporate
investment and domestic demand decline, Istat said yesterday in
its annual report. That compares with the government’s forecast
for a 1.2 percent contraction.  Household consumption and corporate investment will this
year decline 2.1 percent and 5.7 percent respectively, Istat
Chairman Enrico Giovannini said in Rome yesterday. Italian
business confidence declined to a two-year low in April amid
concern that the recession may worsen.  Benetton Group SpA (BEN) , the nation’s largest clothing company,
said on May 15 that its first quarter revenue fell 5.5 percent
amid a worsening economic outlook in its main markets, including
Italy. Chief Executive Officer Biagio Chiarolanza said he does
not expect a quick economic recovery.  Italy’s gasoline consumption dropped 16.1 percent in April
to 675,000 metric tons from 805,000 tons a year earlier,
according to data posted on the Ministry of Economic
Development’s website on May 15.  In a bid to stem a debt crisis that threatens the single
currency’s survival, European leaders will meet in Brussels over
dinner today seeking to allay concerns that  Greece  may quit the
euro, putting Spain and Italy at risk as well.  Istat originally reported April  consumer confidence  at 89.  To contact the reporter on this story:
