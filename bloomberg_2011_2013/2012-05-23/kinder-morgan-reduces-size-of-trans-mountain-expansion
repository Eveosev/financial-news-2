Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP) 
reduced the size of its planned expansion of the Trans Mountain
pipeline by 12 percent to 750,000 barrels a day because fewer
shippers than expected have committed to the oil conduit.  The project’s capacity is 100,000 barrels smaller than
previously planned and will cost $4.1 billion, down from the $5
billion announced in April, according to a statement from the
Houston-based company today.  The final commitments were less than previously expected
because some oil shippers that expressed interest in using the
pipeline failed to obtain their boards’ approval, according to
the statement. The April figure was based on preliminary
commitments, Andrew Galarnyk, a spokesman, said in a telephone
interview.  Kinder Morgan wants to more than double the 715-mile (1,150
kilometers) line’s capacity from 300,000 barrels a day to ship
crude from the  oil-sands  region of Alberta to the port of
Vancouver on Canada’s Pacific Coast. The government of Prime
Minister  Stephen Harper  has said exporting crude produced from
the oil sands to foreign markets is a national priority.  Kinder Morgan shares fell 0.6 percent to $79.77 at the
close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
