Ethanol futures in  Chicago  rebounded
from a one-week low as a heat wave threatens to damage the corn
crop and raise production costs.  Prices jumped on concern that hot weather forecast to
blanket the corn-rich U.S. Midwest Memorial Day holiday weekend
will harm crops. The grain is the primary feedstock for ethanol
production in the U.S.  “You have the weather and you have a tight supply of
corn,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. in Chicago. “With that, ethanol was higher.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 0.4 cent to settle
at $2.135 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding
from the steepest decline since Jan. 12 and the lowest price
since May 15. Ethanol has fallen 3.1 percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf sank 6
cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.175 a gallon and on the West Coast
the biofuel decreased 3.5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.34,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slipped 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
$2.12 a gallon and in  New York  the additive dropped 3 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $2.205.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 1.1 percent to close at
$6.035 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Yesterday, the price plunged 5.7 percent, the biggest decline
since Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
