Queensland’s Greg Inglis scored a
record-breaking try as his team beat New South Wales 18-10 in
the opening game of Australian rugby league’s State of Origin.  Inglis scored his 13th Origin try in the 73rd minute at
 Melbourne ’s Etihad Stadium last night to put the Maroons 16-10
up. The score was allowed after several video replays amid the
Blues’ protests that he hadn’t touched down fairly. Inglis was
previously tied on 12 tries with Dale Shearer.  Earlier, Darius Boyd scored two tries for Queensland, which
is seeking a record-extending seventh straight series win.
Johnathan Thurston added six points for the Maroons.  Akuila Uate and Michael Jennings, who was sin-binned after
a brawl in the first half, got the Blues’ tries. Todd Carney
added a conversion for New South Wales, which last won a series
in 2005. The Maroons regained the initiative after a strong
start by their opponents.  “We just know that if we stick to our game plan we can
come away with a win,” Queensland captain  Cameron Smith  said in
a televised interview.  Queensland has now won 14 of the 19 matches since beginning
its run of series victories in 2006. New South Wales hosts Game
2 on June 13 at Sydney’s ANZ Stadium, with the best-of-three
Australian interstate contest concluding July 4 at Suncorp
Stadium in Brisbane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
