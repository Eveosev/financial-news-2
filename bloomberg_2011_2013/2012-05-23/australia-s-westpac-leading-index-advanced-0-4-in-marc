An Australian index of leading
economic indicators advanced in March as gains in stocks and
dwelling approvals offset weakness in materials prices and
overtime.  The index, a gauge of future economic growth, rose 0.4
percent from a month earlier to 284.6,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and
the Melbourne Institute said in a statement in Sydney today.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  this month
reduced the  overnight cash-rate target  to 3.75 percent from 4.25
percent, the deepest reduction in three years, a decision
forecast by two of 29 economists. The nation’s house prices
declined in the three months through March in the longest losing
streak in at least a decade. Stevens aims to buttress the
housing market, support jobs and boost confidence.  Westpac’s leading index tracks eight gauges of activity,
including company profits and productivity, to give an
indication of how the economy will perform over the next three
to nine months. The coincident index, a measure of the current
state of the economy, rose 0.5 percent in March to 273.7, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
