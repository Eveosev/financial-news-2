England  batsman  Kevin Pietersen  was
fined an undisclosed sum for comments he made on Twitter about
television commentator Nick Knight, the England and Wales
Cricket Board said.  The governing body held a disciplinary hearing yesterday
after Pietersen criticized the Sky Sports commentator, a former
England opener, during the first Test against the West Indies by
writing “Can somebody please tell me how Nick Knight has worked
his way into the commentary box for the Tests?? Ridiculous.”  The cricket board said in a statement it imposed the fine,
part suspended for 12 months, after finding that the comments
were “prejudicial to the interests of the ECB and a breach of
the England player conditions of employment.”  In January,  Sky Sports  agreed a new four-year deal to
broadcast live international and domestic cricket in England
from 2014-2017.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
