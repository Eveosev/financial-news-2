The  Green Bay Packers  signed former
Miami Dolphins defensive end Phillip Merling, who started only
three games since being selected in the second round of the 2008
National Football League draft.  The 6-foot-5, 315-pound Merling has totaled 66 tackles and
3 1/2 sacks in 46 NFL games.  The highlight of Merling’s time in Miami came as a rookie
when he had a 25-yard interception return for a touchdown
against the  New York  Jets in a season-ending win that helped the
Dolphins clinch a division title.  The Packers didn’t disclose terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
