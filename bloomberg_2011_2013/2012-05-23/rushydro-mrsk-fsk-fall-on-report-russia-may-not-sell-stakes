OAO RusHydro,  Russia ’s largest power
producer, Federal Grid Co. and OAO MRSK Holding fell after
Interfax news agency reported that the state may not sell stakes
in the companies.  RusHydro dropped 8.4 percent to 77.31 kopeks by the close
in Moscow. MRSK fell 9.7 percent to 1.852 rubles, the biggest
decliner on the Micex today. Federal Grid, the country’s high-
voltage power transmission monopoly, also known as FSK, lost 9.2
percent to 20.48 kopeks.  Russia added OAO Rosneft, RusHydro, Federal Grid and MRSK,
the managing company for interregional power distributors, to
its list of strategic assets, which may preclude the government
from privatizing them, Interfax reported, citing a decree by
President  Vladimir Putin .  “The news is negative for all the stocks affected,” Alfa
Bank analysts led by Alexander Kornilov said in an e-mailed note
today. “This effectively means that under Russian law the
privatization of any portions of these stakes is possible only
after a special presidential decree.”  The government owned 60.38 percent of RusHydro as of March
31, according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
