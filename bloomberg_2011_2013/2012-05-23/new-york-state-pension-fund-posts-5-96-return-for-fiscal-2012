The  New York  State  Common Retirement
Fund,  the third-largest U.S. public pension, earned an estimated
5.96 percent on investments in the fiscal year that ended March
31, Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said.  The fund’s estimated value of $150.3 billion is the highest
since fiscal 2009, when the global financial crisis began,
DiNapoli said in a statement e-mailed today.  The pension fund’s investments in U.S. stocks, which
account for 38 percent of its holdings, returned 6.9 percent.
Fixed income, about a quarter of all investments, gained 9
percent, while private equity generated 8.3 percent and non-U.S.
equities lost 6.4 percent. Real estate returned 17.6 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  index of stocks rose 5.7 percent
in the same period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 California Public Employees’ Retirement System , the largest U.S.
pension, returned 1.9 percent in the nine months ending March
31, according to a  summary  posted on its website May 7.  “Over the last three years, the fund has experienced
strong gains during a period of economic instability,” DiNapoli
said in the statement. “We remain one of the strongest pension
funds in the country, providing retirement security to more than
1 million New Yorkers.”  The fund had 101.5 percent of the money needed to pay its
obligations in 2010, better than any other state, according to
an annual study by Bloomberg Rankings. It had a 90 percent
funding level at the end of fiscal 2011, Eric Sumberg, a
DiNapoli spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. New York’s
pension plan provides benefits for state and local government
retirees.  In September 2010, the fund lowered its assumed long-term
investment rate of return to 7.5 percent from 8 percent.  -- With assistance from Michael B. Marois in  Sacramento .
