Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  fell the
most in more than a year in Tokyo trading as a Nikkei newspaper
report prompted speculation the world’s biggest automotive
microcontroller maker may struggle to return to profit.  The chipmaker dropped as much as 15 percent, the biggest
decline since March 2011, to 246 yen before trading at 264 yen
as of 11:15 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Renesas expects to announce plans by July to cut jobs and
consolidate plants after posting a loss last fiscal year on
slumping sales of its system chips used in digital appliances,
the Nikkei reported, without saying where it got the information.
The Kawasaki city, Japan-based company’s largest shareholders
are  NEC Corp. (6701) ,  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  and  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)   “It would be hard for investors to buy companies that are
having a hard time getting out of an unprofitable structure,”
Makoto Sengoku, a Tokyo-based market analyst at Tokai Tokyo
Securities Co., said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
