Mitt Romney  moved closer to capturing
the number of delegates required to win the Republican
presidential nomination with victories in yesterdayâ€™s Arkansas
and Kentucky primaries.  After capturing the 75 delegates at stake in those two
states, Romney has 1,067 of the 1,144 delegates needed for the
nomination, according to an Associated Press tally. The
nomination will be formally conferred at the Republican National
Convention Aug. 27-30 in Tampa, Florida.  The 65-year-old former Massachusetts governor may surpass
the required number on May 29, when 152 delegates will be
awarded in the Texas primary. The primaries end June 26 when
Utah votes.  Romney had 68 percent of the vote in Arkansas with all
precincts reporting, according to the AP. Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas and former Senator  Rick Santorum  of Pennsylvania
each had 13 percent and former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich 
of Georgia had almost 5 percent.  In Kentucky, Romney had 67 percent of the vote with all
precincts reporting, according to the AP. Paul, whose son Rand Paul was elected to the Senate from the state in 2010, had
almost 13 percent, followed by Santorum with 9 percent and
Gingrich with 6 percent; another 6 percent were uncommitted.  Challenge for Obama  Results in the Democratic primaries in Arkansas and
Kentucky underscored the political difficulties President  Barack Obama  faces in each state.  In Arkansas, with all precincts reporting, Obama had 58
percent of the vote to almost 42 percent for John Wolfe, a
Tennessee lawyer who qualified for the ballot.  In Kentucky, with all precincts reporting, Obama had 58
percent of the vote to 42 percent for an uncommitted slate of
delegates.  Obama lost both states to Republican  John McCain  in 2008,
Arkansas by 20 percentage points and Kentucky by 16 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
