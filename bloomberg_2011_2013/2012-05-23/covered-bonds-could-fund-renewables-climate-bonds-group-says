Covered bonds, backed by borrowers’
assets and usually carrying lower costs than unsecured bank
debt, could be used to help fund climate-protection projects
including renewable energy, the Climate Bonds Initiative said.  “A renewable-energy covered-bond market could be kick-
started with the use of guarantees by agencies such as the
 European Investment Bank ” while legislation on climate covered
bonds is being developed, Sean Kidney, London-based executive
chairman of the initiative, said today in a  statement  on its
website. His group in November set a quality standard for debt
securities that may help expand the class of assets to be known
as climate bonds.  Covered bonds usually receive higher credit ratings than
unsecured debt issued by banks, the initiative said. That’s
because bond investors have a claim over a dedicated “cover
pool” of assets, as well as a general claim against the issuer
itself.  Issuers are obliged by law to over-collateralize the cover
pool and replace any impaired or matured assets, according to a
report on the initiative’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
