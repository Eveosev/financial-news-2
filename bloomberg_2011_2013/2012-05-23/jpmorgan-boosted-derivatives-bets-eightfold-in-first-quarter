JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  increased bets
on  credit derivatives  on investment-grade debt eightfold in the
first quarter, the period when the bank says it built trading
positions that have produced at least $2 billion of losses.  JPMorgan had sold $83.6 billion more of the derivatives
than it bought as of March 31, according to a  Federal Reserve
report dated May 17 . That compares with a $10.7 billion
difference as of Dec. 31, according to an  earlier report . The
reports don’t provide details on specific trades or bank units
that contributed to the positions.  The latest report provides a glimpse of New York-based
JPMorgan’s total derivatives-trading at the end of March, more
than a month before the bank disclosed the trading loss. Reuters
reported on the Fed data earlier today.  While the bank had a $101.3 billion position on derivatives
expiring more than five years from now, it had a negative $53.8
billion position on derivatives maturing within one year,
according to the latest Fed report. JPMorgan had a $35.1 billion
position in derivatives maturing between one and five years as
of March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
