Citypoint, a 36-story  office tower  in
the City of London financial district, may be sold in 2014 after
talks to restructure the loan used to buy the building
collapsed, according to a regulatory filing.  A Beacon Capital Partners Inc. fund defaulted in January on
429 million pounds ($675 million) of loans secured by the
building, less than a mile from the  Bank of England , according
to a filing to the Irish Stock Exchange by Ulysses (European
Loan Conduit No. 27) Plc, which issued bonds backed by the debt.  Beacon had held talks with noteholders since November about
restructuring the company’s debt. The property should be sold in
July 2014, when the loan is due to mature, because property
values in the City are expected to be rising by that point,
broker  Knight Frank  LLP said in the filing. The building may
fetch about 491.7 million pounds at that time, it said.  The loan is hedged with an interest-rate swap that matures
in 2017. The potential penalty for breaking that swap was 111.5
million pounds in April, according to the filing. The building
may sell for from 386.8 million to 511 million pounds if it’s
sold in 2017, according to Knight Frank.  Boston-based Beacon investment unit CityPoint Holdings I
Ltd. is the borrower, according to the loan prospectus. Nobody
at Beacon’s London office was immediately available for comment.
Beacon senior managing director Paul Stanford had not replied to
an e-mail seeking comment at the time of writing.  Citypoint has 707,000 square feet (66,000 square meters) of
space. The original building, constructed as BP Plc’s global
headquarters, was redeveloped in 2001.
