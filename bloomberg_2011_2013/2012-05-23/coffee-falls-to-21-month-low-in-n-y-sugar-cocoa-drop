Coffee futures sank to a 21-month low
on mounting concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is eroding demand
prospects as exporters boost sales in  Brazil , the world’s
largest grower. Sugar and cocoa also slid.  Global coffee output may outpace demand by 5.3 million bags
in the year that starts in October, Rabobank International said
May 21. The crop in  Colombia , the largest producer of arabica
beans after Brazil, will improve in the second half of the year
and will rise in 2013 from this season, the head of the National
Federation of Coffee Growers said yesterday. The Brazilian real
extended losses to a three-year low. Global equities fell on
signs the European crisis is worsening.  “There’s too much coffee,” Maria Lopez-Calleja, a broker
with INTL FCStone in Miami, said in a telephone interview.
“There’s also much uncertainty surrounding  Greece ’s possible
exit from the euro and who would follow after that.”  Arabica coffee for July delivery plunged 4.4 percent to
settle at $1.669 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after reaching $1.651, the lowest for a most-active
contract since July 28, 2010.  The price has dropped 26 percent this year, making it the
worst performer among the 24 raw materials tracked by the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, which today slumped as much
as 2.3 percent.  ‘Limited’ Upside Potential  While the commodity “has reached my downside target of
$1.65 a pound” for the near term, its “upside potential will
be limited by the advancing harvest in Brazil,”  Boyd Cruel , a
commodity analyst for Vision Financial Markets in  Chicago , said
in a telephone interview.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery fell 1.5 percent to
19.51 cents a pound on ICE, after touching 19.36 cents, the
lowest since Aug. 27, 2010. The sweetener posted its fourth
straight decline, the longest slide in three weeks.  India ’s rupee dropped to a record low. The country is the
world’s biggest producer of sugar after Brazil.  Weakening currencies in India and Brazil “translate into
cheaper sugar becoming available,” Jeff Bauml, a senior vice
president with broker R.J. O’Brien, said in an e-mail.  Cocoa futures for July delivery fell 2.5 percent to $2,124
a metric ton in  New York , the third straight decline. Earlier,
the price reached $2,100, the lowest since April 12.  In London futures trading, robusta coffee, refined sugar
and cocoa also retreated on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
