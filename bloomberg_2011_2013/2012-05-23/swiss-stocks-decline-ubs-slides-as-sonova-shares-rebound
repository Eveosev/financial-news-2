Swiss stocks  fell, snapping a two-day
rally, as investors awaiting a meeting of European Union leaders
in Brussels grew more concerned that Greece will be forced to
leave the euro.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s second-largest
lender, declined 2.3 percent, following European banks lower.
 Swatch Group AG (UHR)  and Cie. Financiere Richemont SA slumped more
than 4 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  retreated 1.6 percent to 5,817.91 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Zurich, extending  this year’s decline to
2 percent . The gauge gained 1.9 percent over the past two days
amid speculation that China and the euro area will act to
bolster economic growth. The Swiss Performance Index lost 1.5
percent today.  “Today’s decline confirms the bearish environment,” said
 Michael Scholz , an equity strategist at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf,
Germany. “Since the gains in the past two days neutralized the
oversold extreme, there’s now room for new lows.”  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 10 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brussels Meeting  The leaders of the EU meet in Brussels today to discuss the
sovereign-debt crisis that has wiped about $4 trillion from
equity markets worldwide this month.  The  U.S. economy  will probably tip back into recession next
year if Congress doesn’t address an impending “fiscal cliff,”
the  Congressional Budget Office  said.  The nonpartisan agency said in a report yesterday that the
world’s largest economy would contract at an annual rate of 1.3
percent in the first half of 2013 if lawmakers allow the George
W. Bush-era tax cuts to expire as scheduled and $1.2 trillion in
 government spending cuts  take effect in January.  Credit Suisse declined 2.3 percent to 19.02 Swiss francs.
The company bought $690.6 million of debt from the Federal
Reserve Bank of  New York ’s Maiden Lane III LLC portfolio, the
district bank said late yesterday.  Financial shares declined, with  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) 
slipping 2.7 percent to 30.49 francs and  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest life insurer, dropping 2.1 percent to
81.95 francs. Zurich Insurance Group AG decreased 2.3 percent to
200.10 francs.  Swatch, the world’s largest watchmaker, lost 4.8 percent to
375.50 francs and Richemont, the owner of the Cartier brand,
retreated 4.2 percent to 56.25 francs.  Oridion Systems Ltd. (OSL)  gained 1.5 percent to 20.90 francs,
its biggest advance in seven weeks, after its shareholders
approved a merger with Covidien Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
