ZAO Sibur Holding, Eastern Europe’s
biggest petrochemicals producer, dropped a plan to build a
pipeline from West Siberia to the Baltics because of the
company’s growing need for products used for refining in
Siberia,  Vedomosti  reported, citing an unidentified Sibur
representative.  The pipeline would have transported 5.5 million metric tons
of liquefied petroleum gas for sale through Baltic Sea ports,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
