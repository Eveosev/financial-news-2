A Senate Democrat said President
Barack Obama’s administration hasn’t adequately informed
Congress about Pacific-region trade negotiations and introduced
legislation to improve communications about the talks.  “The majority of Congress is being kept in the dark as to
the substance of” the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations,
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee’s panel on international trade, said today in a
statement.  The U.S. Trade Representative’s office is negotiating a
deal with  Australia , Brunei, Chile, Malaysia,  New Zealand , Peru,
 Singapore  and Vietnam. Negotiators met this month near Dallas,
and will resume talks in San Diego in early July.  A 2002 law designating a group of lawmakers to consult with
the U.S. trade office has resulted in less communication on
trade between USTR and most congressional offices, Wyden said.  His bill would require USTR “to provide documents related
to trade negotiations to members of Congress and their staff
upon request,” according to a copy of the legislation.  USTR officials didn’t immediately have a comment on Wyden’s
bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
