A woman aboard a diverted  US Airways
Group Inc. (LCC)  flight who said she had a device implanted in her
body won’t be charged, the U.S.  Justice Department  announced.  Lucie Zeeko Marigot, 41, a French citizen and native of
Cameroon, will be handed over to immigration authorities and
returned to France, according to a statement from the U.S.
attorney’s office in Maine.  The flight from Paris to  Charlotte , North Carolina, was
diverted yesterday to Bangor, Maine after Marigot gave a flight
attendant a note written in French that said she had “an object
in her body that is out of my control,” according to the
Justice Department statement.  When the flight attendant asked whether the object might be
harmful, Marigot said she didn’t know. Two doctors on board the
plane examined Marigot and determined she didn’t have any
visible scars indicating a device had been implanted, the
Justice Department said.  The  Boeing Co. (BA)  767 jet landed safely and the subsequent
investigation found no explosives or dangerous items in her
luggage or aboard the plane, according to the statement.  Marigot appeared today before a federal magistrate judge in
Bangor where federal prosecutors said no criminal complaint
would be filed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
