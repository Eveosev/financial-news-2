Spain  will defend its European
Championship soccer title without forward  David Villa , who was
the tournament’s leading scorer four years ago.  Villa, who’s scored 51 goals in 82 games for Spain, told
national team coach Vicente Del Bosque yesterday that he’s not
fit to play in the June 8-July 1 tournament after breaking his
leg while playing for Barcelona at December’s Club World Cup.  “After not getting in the final training and development
required, David Villa spoke with Del Bosque, who relayed that
although it was Villa’s wish to be with the team in Poland and
Ukraine, his physical condition is not as good as would be
desirable,” the Spanish soccer federation said in a statement
on its website.   Del Bosque is scheduled to name his squad on May 27 and
will also be without defender  Carles Puyol , who had knee surgery
May 12. Spain opens its title defense against Italy on June 10
in Gdansk, Poland, before facing the Republic of Ireland four
days later and Croatia on June 18 in its other Group C games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
