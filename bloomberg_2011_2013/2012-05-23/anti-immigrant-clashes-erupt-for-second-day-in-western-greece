Clashes broke out for a second day in
the western port of Patras,  Greece ’s third-largest city, between
residents and police amid rising tensions after the stabbing
death of a Greek man.  “There were small clashes, small episodes today but not as
bad as yesterday,” police spokesman Athanasios Kokkalakis said.  Eight police officers were injured in yesterday’s clashes
as residents  threw rocks  and molotov cocktails at authorities
blocking access to a shuttered factory where illegal immigrants
were staying. Police responded with tear gas.  The violence was sparked by the stabbing death on May 20 of
a 30-year-old Greek man by three suspects who police said are
illegal immigrants. One of the men, an Afghan, has been
arrested, Kokkalakis said.  Those involved in the clashes included supporters of anti-
immigrant party  Golden Dawn . The group entered Parliament for
the first time in the May 6 election as it capitalized on rising
frustration among austerity-hit Greeks against rampant illegal
immigration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
