Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the
nation’s fourth-biggest lender, dropped the most in more than
three weeks on concerns a planned bonus share offer will dilute
the value of the stock.  The stock fell 0.7 percent, the most since April 27, to
14.35 shillings as of the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Co-op Bank, as the lender is known, plans to issue one
bonus share for every five held, the Nairobi-based bank said on
May 17. Shareholders will vote on the proposal at an annual
general meeting on May 25.  “The impact of the bonus is not reflected on the current
share price,” Francis Mwangi, head of research at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.
Standard Investment valued Co-op Bank at 12.37 shillings last
month, Mwangi said.  In the full year to December, Co-op Bank said net income
increased 17 percent to 5.36 billion shillings ($62.9 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
