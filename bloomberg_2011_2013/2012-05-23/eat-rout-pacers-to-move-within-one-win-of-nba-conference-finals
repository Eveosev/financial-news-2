The Miami Heat handed the  Indiana
Pacers  a 115-83 mauling to move within one victory of reaching
the Eastern Conference finals in the National Basketball
Association playoffs.  The Heat led 49-40 at halftime and extended the advantage
to 19 points with one quarter to play at AmericanAirlines Center
in Miami. LeBron James led the home team with 30 points, 10
rebounds and eight assists, while  Dwyane Wade  contributed 28
points. Miami made 61 percent of its field-goal attempts.  “This was a total team effort,” Wade said in a televised
interview. “But it’s good for me to get two games in a row like
this.”  Miami leads the best-of-seven series by three games to two
and can eliminate the Pacers with a victory in Indianapolis in
Game 6 on May 24.  The series winner will play the  Boston Celtics  or the
Philadelphia 76ers for a place in the NBA Finals. That series
resumes tomorrow in Philadelphia with the Celtics leading 3-2 in
games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
