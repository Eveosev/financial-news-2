Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) , which extracts
potash from the Dead Sea to make fertilizer, said first-quarter
profit rose 3 percent as product prices increased.  Net income gained to $288.9 million from $279.7 million a
year earlier and revenue increased to $1.55 billion from $1.53
billion, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Europe, Asia and  North America  were the company’s main
markets, with 43 percent of exports going to Europe and 19
percent to Asia and North America respectively.  Sales of potash to  South America  “increased
significantly,” the company said, reflecting higher sales to
Brazil, compared with the first quarter of 2011. Potash sales to
Asia declined, reflecting a slowdown in the rate of shipments to
 India  and delays in the signing of new supply contracts with
Chinese customers.  A number of extreme weather events, including drought in
China, Europe and the Americas, and cold weather in Europe hurt
crop yields, leading to higher prices for grain in early 2012,
the company said in the statement. Farmers apply potash, a form
of potassium, to their fields to help strengthen plant root
systems making their crops more resistant to drought.  The company said it would pay a dividend of $200 million
for the quarter on June 26.  The shares fell 1 percent to 39.80 shekels at 10:19 in Tel
Aviv, the lowest intraday level since May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
