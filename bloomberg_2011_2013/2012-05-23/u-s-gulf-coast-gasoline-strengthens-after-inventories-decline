Gasoline on the  Gulf Coast 
strengthened after a government report showed a 2.3 percent
decline in regional inventories.  Total  gasoline stocks  in Padd 3 dropped 1.64 million
barrels to 69.2 million barrels last week, Energy Department
data released today showed.  The discount for regular, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf
Coast narrowed 6.37 cents to 14.13 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:02 p.m. Prompt
delivery fell 7.17 cents to $2.6603 a gallon.  Motiva Enterprises LLC is operating its new 330,000-barrel-
a-day crude unit at the  Port Arthur , Texas,  refinery  at 30
percent of capacity and expects to exceed 90 percent by May 31,
two people with knowledge of operations said.  The plant, which began introducing feed to the unit in
April, has ramped up processing to 100,000 barrels a day and
will have it close to full capacity at the end of the month,
said the people, who declined to be identified because they
arenâ€™t authorized to speak for the company.  Gasoline imports to the East Coast fell 15 percent to
533,000 barrels a day, government data showed. Stocks of the
fuel in the region fell 74,000 barrels to 53.6 million.  The same fuel in  New York  Harbor widened its discount 1.13
cents to 8.63 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
