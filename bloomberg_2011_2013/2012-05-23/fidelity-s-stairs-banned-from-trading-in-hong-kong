Former Fidelity Management & Research
Co. portfolio manager George Stairs was banned from dealing in
any securities in Hong Kong for two years for selling shares of
 Chaoda Modern Agriculture Holdings Ltd. (682)  using inside information
about a placement.  The Hong Kong Market Misconduct Tribunal, which announced
the sanction today, didn’t make orders to deprive Stairs of the
losses he avoided because the  insider trading  was executed on
behalf of his funds.  The sanction against Stairs compares with the 7.2 million-
pound ($11.3 million) fine the U.K.’s Financial Services
Authority slapped on U.S. hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc. and
its owner,  David Einhorn , in January for insider trading. Like
Einhorn, Stairs had argued that he didn’t agree to restrict
himself from trading in exchange for material non-public
information, and that he thought the information was already
public knowledge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
