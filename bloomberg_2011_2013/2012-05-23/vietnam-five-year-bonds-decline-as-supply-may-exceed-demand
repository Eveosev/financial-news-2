Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
fell for a second day on speculation the supply of new
securities may exceed demand, prompting the government to accept
higher yields. The dong was steady.  The State Treasury will offer 10 trillion dong ($480
million) of bonds at an auction on May 29, according to a
statement on Hanoi Stock Exchange’s website today. Vietnam
Development Bank, a state-owned lender, will offer 5 trillion
dong of three- and five-year debt on May 25.  “Supply is increasing,” said Hoang Thanh Tam, head of the
fixed-income department at Vietnam Maritime Commercial Joint-
Stock Bank in Hanoi. “People want to take profits right now.”  Five-year  yields  rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 9.69 percent, according to a daily fixing rate from
banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since May
8. Yields have fallen 286 basis points this year.  The dong traded at 20,850 per dollar as of 5:50 p.m. in
Hanoi, the same as yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
