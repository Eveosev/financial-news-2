Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  hired
Daniele Iacovone as head of loan market distribution in London,
according to an e-mailed statement from the bank.  Iacovone will report to Lloyds’ head of loan markets, Simon Allocca, and be tasked with merging the lender’s separate loan
distribution operations.  Previously, Iacovone ran his own private investment
vehicle, Iacovone Investments LLC, which invested in distressed
real estate deals in the U.S. Before that he worked for  Barclays
Capital  in the telecom and media financing team and as head of
global loan sales, according to the statement.  “Daniele brings a wealth of loan sales experience to the
bank and this will be of immense value to our clients,
particularly at the current time when markets are exceedingly
challenging,” Allocca said in the statement. “Bringing
together our distribution efforts into one team will provide a
greater overview and insight into the changing market sentiment
and dynamics.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
