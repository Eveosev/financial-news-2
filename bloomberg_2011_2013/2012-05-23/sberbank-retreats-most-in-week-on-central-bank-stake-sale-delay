OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) , Russia’s biggest
lender, fell the most in almost a week after RIA-Novosti
reported the central bank won’t rush its stake sale.  Sberbank’s ordinary shares lost 4.9 percent to 78.75 rubles
by the close in Moscow, the biggest decline since May 17.  Russia’s central bank won’t speed up its sale of a stake in
Sberbank because it’s not “fiscally motivated” to hasten the
transaction, RIA Novosti reported late yesterday, citing Bank
Rossii First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  speaking in
London. Lenders run or part-owned by the state control more than
half of the banking industry’s assets, the Deposit Insurance
Agency estimated last year.  “This adds to the negative sentiment,” Max Shein, chief
strategist at Broker Credit Service in Moscow, said by phone.
“Investors were hoping that the central bank’s stake sale would
support Sberbank’s shares.”  President  Dmitry Medvedev  ordered the government and
central bank in March to formulate proposals by Sept. 1 for
lowering state holdings in lenders to less than 50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
