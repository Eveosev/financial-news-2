Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said the country’s nationalization of  BFA-Bankia (BKIA)  gives
the government a freer hand as it decides how to deal with other
lenders that its bank-rescue fund has seized.  The nationalization on May 9 of Spain’s third-biggest
lender “opens new possibilities,” de Guindos told reporters
yesterday in  Madrid , without giving details. Since the state
takeover, the government has “more possibilities to act, to
combine and to analyze,” he said.  Even as the government started the process to auction
CatalunyaCaixa, a lender formed from a merger of savings banks,
de Guindos said the government now has “more options” for it
and other failed lenders.  The takeover of BFA-Bankia, followed by a new set of
provisioning rules announced for banks two days later, was
 Spain ’s fourth attempt in three years to restore investors’
confidence in the financial system. The government will
recapitalize BFA-Bankia with as much public money as is
necessary, de Guindos told a parliamentary committee yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
