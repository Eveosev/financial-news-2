National Football League owners voted
to make wearing thigh and knee pads mandatory for players
starting with the 2013 season.  The proposal still requires approval from the NFL Players
Association, which said in a statement that “any change in
working conditions is a collectively bargained issue.”  “We always look forward to meeting with the NFL to discuss
any and all matters related to player health and safety,” the
NFLPA said.  NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  said the league has talked
about making the pads mandatory for at least three years and
discussed the issue with the union as recently as the spring.
Goodell said the technology has improved and the pads are more
protective and allow better performance.  Football players at the high school and college level are
required to wear thigh and knee pads.  “Every other level of football requires these pads and the
NFL doesn’t,” Goodell said at a news conference. “We think
that’s part of sending the right message.”  NFL owners yesterday in Atlanta also approved a two-week
extension of the league’s trade deadline that allows teams to
exchange players through the eighth week of the regular season.
Additionally, owners approved a rule allowing one player from
each club’s injured-reserve list to be added back to the active
roster at a certain point in the season,  NFL.com said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
