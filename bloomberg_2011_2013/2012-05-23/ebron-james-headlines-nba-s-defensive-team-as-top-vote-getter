LeBron James of the  Miami Heat  was
selected to the National Basketball Association’s All-Defensive
first team after receiving the most votes of any player.  James, who was also named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player
this season, is joined on the squad by forward Serge Ibaka of
the Oklahoma City Thunder, guards Chris Paul of the Los Angeles
Clippers and Tony Allen of the Memphis Grizzlies, and center
Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic.  James averaged 1.9 steals and 6.4 defensive rebounds to
lead the Heat, who allowed the fourth-fewest points in the NBA
this season while ranking third in forced turnovers and fifth in
opponent field goal percentage.  James received 24 first-team votes and 53 points from the
league’s 30 head coaches, who selected the first and second
units by position and weren’t permitted to vote for players on
their team. Ibaka, who led the NBA with an average of 3.65
blocks a game, was second with 20 first-team votes.  New York  Knicks center Tyson Chandler made the NBA’s All-
Defensive second team with guards Rajon Rondo of the Boston
Celtics and Kobe Bryant of the  Los Angeles Lakers , and forwards
Luol Deng of the  Chicago Bulls  and Kevin Garnett of Boston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
