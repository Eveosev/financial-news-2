Crude-oil options volatility rose for
the first time in three days as underlying futures slipped below
$90 a barrel.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.44 at 1:38 p.m., on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up from 25.21 percent yesterday.  “We broke below $90 and everything is pretty well bid
right now,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in  New York . “Earlier we were seeing action in
August $105 calls and July $100 calls.”  Crude oil for July delivery fell $1.91 to $89.94 a barrel
at 1:41 p.m. on the Nymex. Today was the first time the front-
month contract had fallen below $90 since November.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were July $80 puts, which rose 17 cents to 33 cents a barrel at
2:09 p.m. with 3,419 lots trading. July $100 calls were the
second-most active options with 2,901 lots changing hands as
they fell 13 cents to 15 cents.  Puts accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic

traded, with 10,021 lots changing hands. They fell 3 cents to 11
cents a barrel. The next-most active options, July $100 calls,
