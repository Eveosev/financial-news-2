The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH) 
fell to a four-month low, retreating 1.8 percent to 32,887.45 by
the close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active equities in the
market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified miner that
makes up about 8 percent of the index, dropped the most in more
than two weeks, falling 2.8 percent to 265.84 rand. Copper fell
in London on concern the euro-region debt crisis may threaten
economic expansion in China, the world’s biggest consumer of the
metal.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL)  , the world’s biggest resources
company, slid 2.7 percent to 222.51 rand.       Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  , the fourth-biggest miner
of the metal, fell to the weakest in seven years, sliding 10
percent to 9.69 rand. The company said it will use stockpiles to
meet production targets at its fire-damaged Mimosa mine in
Zimbabwe. Separately, spot platinum retreated.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , the fourth-largest producer of
the metal, declined for the first time in five days, slipping
1.7 percent to 104.73 rand. Gold fell for a second day in London
as concern about Europe’s debt crisis boosted the dollar and cut
the metal’s appeal as an alternative asset.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the second-biggest
producer of the metal, fell to a three-year low, dropping 3.9
percent to 135.25 rand. The company said it is applying for a
court interdict to get miners to return to work.  Mr Price Group Ltd. (MPC)  , a South African clothing,
furniture and linen retailer, fell the most in more than three
years after full-year earnings missed estimates as trading space
remained flat. The stock slumped 5.4 percent to 96.48 rand.  Taste Holdings Ltd. (TAS)  , a consumer brand holding
company, rose the most in four months, climbing 6.4 percent to
2.34 rand. Earnings per share adjusted for one-time items
increased 16 percent to 12.4 cents in the year through February
and it raised its dividend by 39 percent to 4.6353 cents a
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
