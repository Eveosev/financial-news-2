Oando Plc (OANDO) , a Nigerian energy company,
dropped for a fourth day, retreating to the lowest price in
almost nine years, after full-year profit disappointed
investors, according to Lambeth Trust and Investment Co.  The stock dropped 5 percent to 14.99 naira by the close in
Lagos, the commercial capital, the lowest price since August
2003. The shares have retreated 13 percent in the past four
sessions.  Net income for the 12 months through December declined 74
percent to 3.67 billion naira ($23 million), Oando said May 21,
which was “below investors’ expectations,” David Adonri, chief
executive officer of Lambeth Trust, said by phone today, also
citing a lack of a dividend announcement.  “The stock will fall massively further because investors’
confidence in the company is very low now,” he added, without
saying how far it could decline.  Oando expected a drop in profit for 2011 after a 9.62
billion naira write-off, Chief Executive Officer Wale Tinubu
said on April 10, citing “impairment of assets,” costs of
acquisitions and other charges.  The fall in profit “is a sign that the business is not
being properly managed,” Adonri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
