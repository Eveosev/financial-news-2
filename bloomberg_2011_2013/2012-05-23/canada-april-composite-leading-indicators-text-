Following is the text of
 Canada â€™s leading indicators report from  Statistics Canada .  The composite leading indicator rose 0.3% in April,
matching the increase in March. This was the 10th consecutive
monthly increase. Of the 10 components, 7 advanced in the month.  The components related to household demand supported the
increase in April, led by a rise in housing starts. Both
furniture sales and sales of other durable goods posted a third
monthly gain. The financial components remained positive, as did
employment in services. The average workweek, however, declined
after being flat in the two previous months. The United States
leading indicator rose for the third straight month, supported
by its financial components and building permits.  In manufacturing, new orders fell for the second month in a
row, while the ratio of shipments to inventories was unchanged.  Note to readers  This is the final release of the composite leading
indicator, which is being discontinued.  To contact the reporter on this story:
