New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech coking-coal producer, extended this month’s decline as
growing concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening drove
investors from commodities and other riskier assets.  The stock traded down 0.6 percent to 104.4 koruna by 10:13
a.m. in Prague, after earlier sliding as much as 1.9 percent.
NWR has declined 17 percent so far in May, poised for its worst
month since September last year.  Europe’s benchmark coal futures contracts fell 1.9 percent
to $98.5 a metric ton in the Netherlands, the lowest price in 20
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
