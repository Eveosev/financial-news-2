Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX) , the U.S. miner
that said yesterday it’s still trying to finalize $625 million
of loan and credit facilities, had its credit rating cut by
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.  The rating was reduced to CCC from B- and was kept on watch
negative, S&P said today in a statement. A CCC rating is eight
levels below investment-grade.  Patriot said yesterday it hired the private-equity company
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and was still talking with Citigroup Inc.,
Barclays Plc and Natexis to strengthen its finances. The St.
Louis-based company dropped a record 35 percent in New York
trading yesterday after Debtwire reported that it fielded formal
pitches from restructuring advisers.  The shares rose 22 percent to $2.66 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
