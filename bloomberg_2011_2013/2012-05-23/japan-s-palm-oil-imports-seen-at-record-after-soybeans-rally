A rally in soybeans is spurring  Japan ,
Asia’s second-largest buyer, to seek record imports of  palm oil ,
which is displacing  soybean oil  in margarine to potato chips.  Imports of the tropical oil may expand to 600,000 metric
tons from last year’s 557,937 tons, said Yoshinori Komura,
managing director of the Japan Oilseed Processors Association.
Soybean crushing may decline more than 3 percent to 2 million
tons from 2011, he said in an interview in Tokyo yesterday.  Food producers are facing difficulties in passing on higher
raw-material costs to consumers as the world’s third-biggest
economy is mired in deflation. Soybean’s 14 percent rally this
year, coupled with a strong yen against the dollar, boosted
demand for palm oil as soybean oil makers including  Nisshin
Oillio Group Ltd. (2602)  and  J-Oil Mills Inc. (2613)  proposed raising
wholesale prices in April, the first increase in a year.  “Palm oil consumption in Japan is expanding while demand
for vegetable oils is declining,” said Masayuki Kumagai, head
of the oil and fat division at the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries. “Palm oil is increasingly used as a
substitute for soy oil or rapeseed oil.”  Malaysia Exports  Record purchases by Japan will boost palm oil exports from
Malaysia, the second-biggest producer, which supplied 95 percent
of imports last year. Reduced soybean imports will mean lost
sales for the U.S., the largest shipper, which supplied 67
percent of Japan’s purchases in 2011.  Soybean futures in  Chicago  reached $15.125 a bushel on May
2, the highest level since July 2008, as drought damaged crops
in Brazil and Argentina, the second- and third-biggest exporters.
Soybeans traded at $13.7275 a bushel at 1:06 p.m. in Tokyo.  China , the largest importer, increased purchases from the
U.S. as supply from South America declined. Chinese imports are
forecast to expand 8.9 percent to 61 million tons in the year
starting October, representing more than 60 percent of global
shipments, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Palm oil futures in Malaysia have lost 3.8 percent this
year, while the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials
has decreased 3.1 percent. Palm oil fell 1.7 percent to 3,057
ringgit ($974) a ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives Exchange.  “Palm oil consumption in margarine production is rising as
manufacturers are looking for cheaper raw-materials,” said
Tsutomu Ueda,  executive director  for Japan Margarine, Shortening
and Lard Industries Association.  Margarine, Soy Oil  Palm oil consumption in Japan’s margarine production
increased 1.2 percent to 52,572 tons in 2010, while soy oil use
dropped 12 percent to 10,643 tons, association data show.  Japan’s production of soy oil declined 14 percent to
401,455 tons last year, while imports of palm and palm-kernel
oils increased 3.5 percent to 649,604 tons, according to the
agriculture ministry.  Japan’s soy oil output also decreased on weaker demand for
local soymeal, said Kazufumi Aramoto, secretary general for the
Japan Oil & Fat Importers & Exporters Association.  Soybeans are crushed to produce oil and soybean meal, a
source of protein for livestock. Demand for imported soymeal
expanded as the yen’s rally to a postwar record against the
dollar reduced purchasing costs for Japanese feed mills.  Japanese imports of soymeal climbed to a record 2.20
million tons last year from 2.19 million in 2010, according to
the agriculture ministry. India was the largest supplier with
1.3 million tons, followed by the U.S. with 376,556 tons.  “I can’t see any factors that will revitalize soybean
crushing in the near term,” Aramoto said. “Japanese
manufacturers may have tough times ahead as their plants are
running well below capacity, threatening earnings.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
