A strike by Brazilian subway workers
demanding wage increases paralyzed  South America ’s biggest city
with record traffic jams as police used gas bombs to disperse
protests by metro-users at rush hour.  Military police arrested at least two people after about
2,000 protestors demonstrated against the interruption of
services at the Itaquera subway station by blocking roads,
hurling rocks, and slashing tires of buses, Globo News reported
today.  Traffic jams stretched for 249 kilometers across the city,
exceeding the previous record of 191 kilometers when heavy rains
flooded the streets in 2004, according to daily newspaper  Folha
de S. Paulo .  “The best way out of this impasse is, without a doubt, for
the metro to negotiate quickly with the metro workers and attend
to our fair demands,” the  Sao Paulo  metro workers’ union said
in a  statement  on its website today. The union rejected the
subway operator’s offer of a salary increase in a May 16
meeting.  Sao Paulo’s public transport operator SPTrans is offering
emergency transport services beginning today, according to a
statement on its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
