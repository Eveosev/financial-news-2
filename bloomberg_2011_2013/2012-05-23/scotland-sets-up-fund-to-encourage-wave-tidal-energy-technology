Scotland  opened an 18 million-pound
fund ($28 million) to bids from developers of wave and tidal
energy technology to spur business in the nascent industry.  The Marine Renewables Commercialisation Fund will announce
successful bids by the end of the year, the Scottish government
said in an e-mailed statement today. The fund is part of a 35
million-pound investment by the government over three years.  “This new fund will be critical to tackle the next set of
challenges and innovate to drive down costs of both wave and
tidal power,” Stephen Wyatt from the Carbon Trust, which is
working with the government on the fund, said in the statement.  Energy from waves now costs about $445 a megawatt-hour and
tidal power $402 a megawatt-hour, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Those figures compare with the
cost of coal-fired power of about $78 a megawatt-hour.  Scotland plans to effectively source all of its power from
renewable sources by 2020. The country has the potential to
provide as much as 25 percent of  Europe ’s tidal power, and a
10th of its wave power, according to the government. Scotland
currently gets about 35 percent of its power from clean energy.  Scotland awarded 500,000 pounds of its 70 million-pound
National Renewables Infrastructure Fund to support development
of a dock near Glasgow as a hub for making clean energy systems.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
