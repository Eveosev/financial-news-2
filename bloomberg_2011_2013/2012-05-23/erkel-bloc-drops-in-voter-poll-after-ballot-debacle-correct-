Support for German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s governing Christian Democratic bloc slid in a weekly
voter poll after her party suffered its worst election result
since World War II in a May 13 ballot.  The  Christian Democratic Union  and its Bavarian sister
party, the  Christian Social Union , were backed by 31 percent of
voters in the Forsa poll for Stern magazine and RTL published
today. That’s down from 35 percent in last week’s poll,
conducted before the vote. Backing for the opposition Social
Democrats and Greens rose 1 percentage point to 40 percent.  Merkel, the dominant figure in more than two years of debt-
crisis fighting in  Europe , is losing ground at home as divisions
outside  Germany  deepen over her campaign for austerity in debt-
swamped euro-member states. The chancellor heads to a Brussels
summit today unable to stifle calls for measures she opposes,
including euro bonds, the use of European money to recapitalize
banks, a bigger rescue fund and extra time for struggling
countries to cut spending.  Merkel stood firm on her debt-crisis policy on May 14, a
day after the CDU’s defeat in Germany’s most populous state
helped the Social Democrats tighten their grip on the country’s
regional governments, saying voters didn’t reject budget
austerity for the currency union.  Today’s tally was the worst poll result for Merkel’s bloc
since October, after support rose as high as 38 percent in
February. Research institute Forsa surveyed 2,002 people from
May 14 to May 18, with a margin of error of as much as 2.5
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
