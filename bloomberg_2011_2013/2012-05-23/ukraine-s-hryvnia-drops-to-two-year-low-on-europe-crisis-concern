The hryvnia depreciated for a seventh
day against the dollar, poised for its longest losing streak
since December 2008, on speculation uncertainty about  Europe ’s
debt crisis is damping demand for the country’s debt.  The Ukrainian currency lost 0.7 percent to 8.11 per dollar
as of 10:46 a.m. in the capital, Kiev, heading for the weakest
closing level since February 2010. The former Soviet republic’s
$1 billion of dollar-denominated debt due November 2016 fell for
the first time in three days, increasing the yield by three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.47 percent.  European leaders are meeting in Brussels today to discuss
the region’s debt crisis that has wiped more than $4 trillion
from equity markets worldwide this month. The yield spread on
Ukrainian bonds over the emerging-market average has jumped 10
basis points this month to 466 basis points.  “Non-residents cut their share in Ukraine’s treasury bills
last week from 4.2 billion hryvnia to 3.2 billion hryvnia as the
government repaid some debt,” Vladislav Sochinsky, treasurer at
Citigroup Inc.’s Ukrainian unit, said by phone. “They did not
reinvest, but converted the hryvnia into dollars because
concerns over the euro-zone crisis strengthened while
expectations for global economic growth worsened.”  Sochinsky predicts the hryvnia will rally over the next few
days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
