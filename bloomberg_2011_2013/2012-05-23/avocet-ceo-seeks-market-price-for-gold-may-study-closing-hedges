Avocet Mining Plc (AVM) , a gold producer in
Burkina Faso, said it would rather sell its output at market
prices than fixed rates and may consider closing the hedge book
it inherited in 2009.  “If there was a way that we could close it out in some
fashion, in the right market conditions, we would consider it,
but it’s a big number,” Chief Executive Officer Brett Richards
said in an interview in London. “If I had my way we would be
unhedged. I would like full exposure to the gold price.”  Gold producers can sell future output at fixed prices to
lock in profit or secure loans, and can reduce hedges by buying
back contracts. Avocet was among gold miners to buy back part of
its hedged production last year as prices for the precious metal
headed toward an 11th annual gain.  The London-based company spent about $40 million reducing
its forward sales by 20 percent in July and extended the
delivery of its remaining hedged production by four years. It
now has 8,250 ounces of hedged output per quarter, compared with
25,000 ounces previously.  Avocet inherited the hedge book when it bought Wega Mining
ASA for 53 million pounds ($83 million) in 2009, gaining control
of the Inata gold mine in  Burkina Faso . The company’s hedge
lasts until June 2018 with gold sold at $950 an ounce.  “If there is optionality where we could close it out, or
close part of it out, on the back of some other corporate
activity then I see value in that,” Richards said yesterday.
“On its own it would be very hard to crystallize a $130 million
liability today.”  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the biggest producer of the metal, and
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU)  have also cut forward sales after the
hedges forced them to sell their output below market rates.
Barrick spent almost $5 billion to eliminate such contracts.  Avocet is targeting annual gold production of about 160,000
ounces at Inata this year at a cost of $800 to $850 an ounce.
The company plans an expansion of the mine, which will be
completed in 2013 and boost annual output to 240,000 ounces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
