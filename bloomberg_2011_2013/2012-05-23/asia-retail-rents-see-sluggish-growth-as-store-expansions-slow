Asia-Pacific retail rent growth
“remains sluggish” as  Europe ’s debt crisis causes retailers to
put expansion plans on ice, said property broker  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)   An index of 16 Asia-Pacific market rents recorded an
increase of 0.4 percent in the three months ended March 31 from
the prior quarter, CBRE said in an e-mailed report. Hong Kong’s
average prime rents rose 1.9 percent, slowing from the 3.3
percent growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011, while
rents across south-east  Asia  and in Australia and New Zealand
fell 0.3 percent.  “The sluggish rate of growth was due to domestic retailers
exercising more caution towards further expansion amid the still
uncertain economic outlook,” CBRE said in the report. Other
factors included resistance to high rents demanded by landlords
and rental discounts offered for space in new projects,
according to the report.  While Asian economies are expected to expand by about 6
percent in 2012, similar to last year, they still face risks
from the European debt crisis, the  International Monetary Fund 
said in April. Retail sales growth across Asia Pacific excluding
 Japan  slowed to 11.6 percent in the first quarter from a year
ago, compared with a 13.7 percent expansion in the previous
three months, CBRE said.  While retailers still expanded and entered new cities
during the quarter, the pace of growth slowed, according to the
report. Luxury brands continued to push into new markets,
particularly in Greater China,  Hong Kong  and Singapore, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
