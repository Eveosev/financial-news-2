McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s largest
restaurant chain, sold $900 million of bonds including a seven-
year portion with a coupon that matched a record low, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company sold $500 million of 0.75 percent three-year
notes to yield 45 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $400 million of 1.875 percent seven-year debt
with a spread of 88 basis points to equal the record coupon set
by International Business Machines Corp. on May 8, the data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Big Mac seller, which claimed the lowest yield on 30-
year debt almost four months ago, is borrowing money as it plans
to hire 70,000 people in  China  this year, almost doubling its
workforce there, and accelerates new store openings in the Asian
nation to compete with Yum! Brands Inc.’s KFC and Pizza Hut.  McDonald’s paid a 3.7 percent coupon on its $500 million of
30-year bonds sold Feb. 2, a record low for the maturity,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities traded
at 97.4 cents on the dollar to yield 3.85 percent May 18,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Proceeds from today’s offering may be used for general
corporate purposes, according to a person familiar with the
offering who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly about the deal. The debt  may be
rated  A2 by Moody’s Investors Service and an equivalent A by
 Standard & Poor’s , the person said.  Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and  Wells Fargo & Co . managed the
sale for the  Oak Brook , Illinois-based company, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
