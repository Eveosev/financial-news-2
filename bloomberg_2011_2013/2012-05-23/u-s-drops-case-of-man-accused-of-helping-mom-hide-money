Federal prosecutors in New York
dropped an indictment of a  San Francisco  man charged with
helping his mother hide $11.3 million at Swiss bank  UBS AG (UBSN)  from
tax authorities and smuggling $450,000 into the U.S.  The office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in  Manhattan 
dropped an October 2010 indictment charging Samuel Phineas Upham
with one count of conspiracy to commit  tax fraud  and three
counts of aiding in the preparation of false tax returns. Upham
pleaded not guilty after his arrest on Nov. 29, 2010, in San
Francisco.  “Based on a review of circumstances and information
pertaining to this defendant acquired subsequent to the filing
of the indictment, the government has concluded that further
prosecution of the defendant would not be in the interests of
justice,” prosecutors said in a May 18 filing in federal court
in  New York .  Upham’s mother, Sybil Nancy Upham, was charged in April
2010 and pleaded guilty seven months later. Prosecutors have
charged about 50 U.S. taxpayers with tax crimes since 2009, when
UBS avoided prosecution by paying $780 million and admitting it
helped thousands of Americans evade taxes. The U.S. also charged
more than 20 offshore bankers, attorneys and advisers.  Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for Bharara, declined to
comment on the decision to drop the case against Samuel Upham.
His attorney, Michael J. Gilbert of Dechert LLP, didn’t
immediately return a call today seeking comment. Upham couldn’t
immediately be located for comment.  ‘Family Member A’  The indictment accused Upham of conspiring to defraud the
 Internal Revenue Service  by helping a relative identified as
“Family Member A” prepare tax returns that failed to declare
as much as $11.3 million at UBS, the largest Swiss bank. Stuart Abrams, Upham’s attorney at the time, said the family member was
the Upham’s mother.  In November 2010, Sybil Nancy Upham pleaded guilty to one
count of conspiracy and subscribing to false tax returns in
2004, 2006 and 2007 that failed to disclose her UBS accounts.  She admitted that in 1993, she opened a UBS account under
the name of a sham Liechtenstein foundation. Working with a
Swiss financial adviser, she opened a second account in 2005 in
the name of a sham Hong Kong corporation, she admitted. By 2007,
her accounts were worth more than $11 million, she admitted.  Liechtenstein Bank  After June 2008, she said she moved $8.6 million to a small
Liechtenstein bank. She also admitted she “caused large sums of
currency” to be smuggled into the U.S. She paid a $5.5 million
civil penalty and is awaiting sentencing.  The indictment of Samuel Upham charged that in May 2005, he
visited UBS offices in Zurich and withdrew $150,000 in cash that
he smuggled into the U.S. He also withdrew $300,000 in cash in
December 2007 and smuggled it into the U.S., prosecutors
charged.  Upham prepared his mother’s tax returns from 2005 to 2007,
helping her fail to reported $1.98 million in income from her
UBS accounts and avoid $502,884 in taxes, according to the
indictment. Those returns were filed between December 2007 and
April 2008, according to the indictment.  The case is U.S. v. Upham, 10-cr-01028, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
