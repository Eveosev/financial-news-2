U.K. manufacturing demand fell to the
weakest this year in May and the outlook “deteriorated
sharply,” the  Confederation of British Industry  said.  An index of  factory orders  dropped to minus 17 from minus 8
in April, the employers’ group in London said in a report today.
That’s the lowest since December. A gauge of export orders
slipped to minus 12, the lowest since January, from minus 10.  The  International Monetary Fund  said yesterday that
 Britain’s economy  faces “large” risks from the euro-area debt
crisis and may require further stimulus from the  Bank of England 
and the government. While the central bank stopped expanding
stimulus this month, Governor  Mervyn King  has said that the U.K.
is in “turbulent waters.”  The CBI’s gauge of expected output for the next three
months slumped to minus 3 in May, the lowest since December,
from 24 in April, while a measure of expected selling prices
rose to 12 from 7. An index of stocks stocks fell to 13 from 14.  The CBI conducted the survey of 451 manufacturers between
April 25 and May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
