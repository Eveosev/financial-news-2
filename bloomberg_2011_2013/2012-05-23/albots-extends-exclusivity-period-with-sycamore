Talbots Inc. (TLB)  extended its exclusivity
agreement with Sycamore Partners LP for an additional day as it
considers the private-equity firm’s $215 million buyout offer.  The exclusivity period will expire tomorrow, the Hingham,
Massachusetts-based company said today in a statement.
Sycamore’s most recent offer was for $3.05 a share.  Talbots said earlier this month that it was considering the
offer after rejecting a previous bid of $3 a share as
“substantially” undervaluing it. The company has posted seven
straight quarters of year-over-year sales  declines  after it
alienated its traditional older female customers by trying to
attract younger shoppers.  The shares climbed 9.9 percent to $2.55 at the close in  New
York . Talbots has dropped 4.1 percent this year.  Talbots first entered the exclusivity agreement on May 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
