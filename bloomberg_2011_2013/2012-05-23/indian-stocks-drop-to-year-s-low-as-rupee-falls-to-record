India’s benchmark stock index fell to
near its lowest level this year as the rupee’s decline to a
record renewed concern the government will find it difficult to
control inflation and the fiscal deficit.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the nation’s largest mobile-phone
operator, slumped to its lowest level in about two years.  Tata
Power Co. (TPWR) , the largest private utility, tumbled to its lowest
price since January after unexpectedly reporting a loss, partly
due to currency losses. The rupee touched an all-time low of
56.2213 per dollar today.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, retreated 0.5
percent to 15,948.10 at the close, its lowest level since Jan.
9. The 30-stock gauge has lost 13.5 percent from its Feb. 21
high, exceeding the 10 percent slump that signifies a correction
to some investors.  “Currency is the biggest issue,” Ambareesh Baliga, chief
operating officer at Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. in Mumbai, told
Bloomberg UTV today. “This could lead to inflation which is not
demand led, but currency-led. If the fiscal deficit slips
further we could possibly see the rupee at 58 to 60 a dollar and
calculations will go haywire.”  Concern  India ’s outlook has worsened because of trade and
fiscal deficits, policy gridlock, elevated  consumer prices  and
faltering global growth has made the rupee the worst-performing
Asian currency this quarter. Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said
yesterday the government needs to take “difficult” steps to
curb spending and boost revenue as his Congress party and its
allies marked the third anniversary of their government.  ‘Investor Confidence’  Foreign funds  have pulled out a net $71 million from local
shares this month, after becoming net sellers in April for the
first time in 2012, data from the regulator show. Still, their
investments of a net $8.7 billion into local equities so far
this year is a record for the period, the data show.  The rupee’s slide “should be a wake-up call for Indian
authorities,”  Geoff Lewis , head of investment services at
JPMorgan Asset Management in  Hong Kong , said on Bloomberg UTV
today. “They really need to be more proactive in regaining or
sustaining investor confidence. India has some macro-economic
problems and yet very little of the $9 billion of the portfolio
flows has left the country. Investors are watching carefully.”  The rupee declined 1.1 percent to 56.0050 per dollar at the
5 p.m. close, extending this quarter’s loss to 9.2 percent, the
worst performance among Asian currencies. A weak currency rupee
fuels inflation by raising the cost of oil in a nation that buys
80 percent of its crude from overseas.  VIX Jumps  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, jumped 11 percent to 27.13,
the highest level since March 6. The Nifty lost 0.5 percent to
4,835.65. The BSE 200 Index too fell 0.5 percent. A total of 715
million shares traded on the BSE and NSE yesterday, 21 percent
less than the 12-month daily average.  Bharti Airtel plunged 4.4 percent to 282.1 rupees, its
lowest price since July 8, 2010. Tata Power lost 1.9 percent to
88.65 rupees, its lowest close since Jan. 2, after reporting an
unexpected loss due to an impairment provision for its Mundra
plant and currency losses. Group loss was 6.29 billion rupees
($114 million) in the March quarter, compared with a profit of
6.25 billion rupees a year earlier.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage
lender, slid 1.1 percent to 635.5 rupees, ending a four-day
advance.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the largest developer, retreated 1.2 percent
to 183.9 rupees.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the biggest
copper and zinc producer, decreased 1.5 percent to 94.35 rupees,
extending this week’s fall to 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
