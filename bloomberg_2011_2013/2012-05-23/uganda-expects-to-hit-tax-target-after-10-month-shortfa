Uganda  expects to reach its tax
revenue target of 6.2 trillion shillings ($2.5 billion) in the
2011-12 financial year even after a shortfall in the first 10
months, said Richard Kamajugo, the commissioner for customs.  The tax authority collected 4.96 trillion shillings against
a target of 5.34 trillion in the 10 months through April, as
high  interest rates  discouraged importers from borrowing to
clear their goods through customs, Kamajugo told reporters today
in Kampala, the capital. Some major banks charge an interest of
27.5 percent to 28.5 percent on loans.  “We still expect to meet our target, the deficit is not
insurmountable,” he said. “We have observed improved financial
results especially from the banking sector which is a major
contributor to corporate tax.”  Deposits at Uganda’s commercials bank grew 11 percent to
8.9 trillion shillings last year, while profit climbed to 488.3
billion shillings from 268.7 billion shillings a year earlier,
according to the central bank’s website.  Uganda, East Africa’s third-biggest economy, collects about
13 percent of gross domestic product in taxes, according to the
 finance ministry . Donors fund at least 30 percent of the
country’s budget, Kenneth Mugambe, an official at the ministry,
said on April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
