Authorities of the Republic of
Yakutia, part of which lies in  Russia â€™s Arctic zone, banned
sales of spirits in stores from 8 p.m. till 2 p.m. to combat
alcohol addiction, RIA Novosti said.  The restriction will cover all alcoholic drinks, including
beer, with strength of more than 5 percent. Starting January
next year, the ban will cover beer with an alcohol content of 5
