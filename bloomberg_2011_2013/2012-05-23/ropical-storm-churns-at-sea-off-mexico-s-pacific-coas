Tropical Storm Bud churned at sea off
 Mexico ’s southern Pacific coast with top winds unchanged at 40
miles per hour (65 kilometers per hour), the National Hurricane
Center said.  The storm was moving northwestward at 12 mph about 420
miles south-southwest of the resort port of Manzanillo, Mexico,
the Miami-based center said today in a 2 a.m. PDT  advisory .  Bud is expected to turn north and then to the northeast
toward the coast in the next day or two, the NHC said. Some
strengthening is forecast over the next 48 hours though the
storm is not expected to near hurricane strength nor come ashore
as was forecast earlier this week, the NHC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
