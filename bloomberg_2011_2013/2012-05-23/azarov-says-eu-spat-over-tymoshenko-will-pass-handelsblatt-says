Ukrainian Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said differences with the European Union over the
prosecution of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko will pass,
as cooperation in the fields of energy and armaments is more
important,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview.  Azarov said he wants a 10-year, three-party contract for
the transport of gas between Russia, the EU and Ukraine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
