Canada’s dollar weakened against its
U.S. counterpart for a second day as concern increased before a
European Union leaders’ meeting and a government report forecast
to show retail sales rose in March.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, slumped after
Greece’s former Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  told the Wall
Street Journal there is a risk, however unlikely, that the
nation will leave the euro. The currency’s drop was limited
before the sales report, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m.  “We’ll take our cues from what is going on in Europe, as
it dictates  market sentiment , but for now it seems pretty
negative,” said Matthew Perrier, Toronto-based director of
foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal. “The reaction as far as
the Canadian dollar is concerned has been fairly limited.”  The currency weakened 0.2 percent to C$1.0225 per  U.S.
dollar  at 7:47 a.m. in Toronto. It fell to as low as C$1.0238,
after reaching C$1.0247 on May 21, the weakest level since Jan.
16. One Canadian dollar buys 97.80 U.S. cents.  Canadian retail sales rose 0.3 percent in March after
declining 0.2 percent in the previous month, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
