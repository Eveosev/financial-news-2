Brazil ’s economy grew at a moderate
pace in the first months of 2012, the central bank said in its
regional economy  report  published on its website.  The “relative recovery” was fueled by retail sales and
robust domestic demand, the bank said.  Brazil’s economic expansion faltered in the first quarter
even as policy makers cut  borrowing costs  to near record lows,
reduced taxes on home appliances and directed the state
development bank to boost lending. The seasonally adjusted
economic activity index, a proxy for gross domestic product,
fell 0.35 percent in March after drops in January and February.  Economists reduced their forecasts for 2012 growth after
the most recent data were released May 18. GDP will rise 3.09
percent this year, down from a forecast of 3.20 percent the week
before, according to a weekly central bank survey of about 100
economists at financial institutions, released May 21.  Policy makers have reduced benchmark borrowing costs by 3.5
percentage points since August, more than in any other Group of
20 nation, to 9 percent. Interest-rate futures contracts show
traders betting the rate will fall to 8 percent later this year.  Prices rose less than analysts forecast in mid-May,
climbing 0.51 percent, compared with a median estimate of 0.56
percent among economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
