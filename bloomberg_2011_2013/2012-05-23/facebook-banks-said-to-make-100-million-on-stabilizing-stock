Facebook Inc. (FB) â€™s underwriters for its
initial public offering made gains of about $100 million through
their work to stabilize the shares in public trading, said a
person familiar with the matter.  The gains will be shared by all banks on the IPO syndicate,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
process was private.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  will use some of the gains
to reimburse clients who lost money because of glitches in trade
execution, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
