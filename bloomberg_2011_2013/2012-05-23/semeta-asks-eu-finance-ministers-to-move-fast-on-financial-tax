European Union Tax Commissioner
Algirdas Semeta urged speedy action on proposals to impose a
broad financial transaction tax throughout the 27-nation bloc.  “It is now in the hands of  Europe ’s finance ministers to
reach a quick decision on the commission’s proposal,” Semeta
said in a statement today after the European Parliament adopted
its opinion on how to design such a tax, which lawmakers said
should move forward even if only some nations want to adopt it.
EU tax proposals do not require legislative approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
