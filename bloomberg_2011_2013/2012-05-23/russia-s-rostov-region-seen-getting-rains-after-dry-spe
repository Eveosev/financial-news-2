Rain and hail are forecast to start
falling tomorrow in Russia’s southern Rostov region, the  Federal
Hydrometeorological Center  said.  Wind speeds as high as 20 meters a second (45 miles an
hour) are expected to accompany the rains, the center said on
its website today. The region harvested 7.7 million metric tons
of grain last year, or about 8.2 percent of Russia’s total crop.  Parts of the region, which lacked rains for about a month,
will retain high wildfire risks today and tomorrow, the center
said. Such risks will be present also in the Volgograd and
Astrakhan regions and Republic of Kalmykia in three days to May
25, the forecaster said. Those areas are located in the Southern
Federal District, which accounted for more than 24 percent of
 Russia ’s grain crop last year with about 22.7 million tons of
cereals harvested, according to state statistics.  Rains will boost soil moisture and while hail “is always
dangerous,” it probably will be localized, Anna Strashnaya,
head of agrometeorological forecasts at the center, said by
phone in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
