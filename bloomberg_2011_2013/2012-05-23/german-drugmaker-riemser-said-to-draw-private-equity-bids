Riemser Arzneimittel AG, one of
eastern  Germany ’s largest drugmakers, is drawing interest from
buyout firms including Warburg Pincus LLC, Montagu Private
Equity LLP and Triton Advisers UK Ltd., according to people
familiar with the process.  The company, based on the island of Riems, near Greifswald,
may fetch as much as 300 million euros ($379 million), said the
people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. Jefferies Group Inc., which is running the sale, may
select a shortlist of bidders by the end of the month, said the
people.  Riemser Chief Executive Officer Michael Mehler confirmed
that the drugmaker is talks with a “selected group” of private
equity and strategic investors, without providing further
details. He declined to comment on the timing or the price of a
potential deal.  Riemser, which is owned by the Braun family, GE Healthcare
Financial Services and TVM Capital, employs more than 600
people, has sales of more than 115 million euros, and exports to
more than 72 countries, according to its website. It focuses on
oncology, dermatology, dental products and anti-infectives.  Warburg and Montagu declined to comment. A representative
of Triton was not immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
