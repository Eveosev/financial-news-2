The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rebounded on speculation their declines to the lowest
levels this year were excessive.  The so-called kiwi gained against all of its major peers
after data showed New Zealand’s trade surplus rose in April.
Demand for the South Pacific currencies was limited after
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  said following a European Union summit
that Germany stands by its opposition to jointly issued common
bonds, deepening concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  “The markets have been excessively pessimistic,” said
Kengo Suzuki, a foreign-exchange strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho
Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest bank by market
value. “We’re seeing some buying back in the Aussie and kiwi
because they’ve been falling too rapidly.”  Australia’s dollar added 0.2 percent to 97.62 U.S. cents as
of 3:38 p.m. in Sydney from the close in  New York  yesterday,
when it touched 96.90, the weakest since Nov. 25. It rallied 0.2
percent to 77.61 yen. New Zealand’s currency gained 0.4 percent
to 75.26 U.S. cents, after sliding to 74.57 yesterday, the
weakest since Nov. 28. The kiwi bought 59.83 yen, 0.4 percent
stronger than yesterday’s close.  The Australian dollar’s 14-day relative strength index
against its U.S. counterpart was at 26 today, below the 30 level
that signals to some traders an asset’s price may rebound. The
gauge for the kiwi was at 25.  New Zealand’s exports exceeded imports by NZ$355 million
($267 million), from a revised NZ$186 million in March, the
statistics office said today in Wellington.  New Zealand’s Budget  Separately, the government said it projected a narrower
 budget surplus  in 2015. The operating surplus will be NZ$197
million in the year through June 2015, compared with a
previously forecast NZ$370 million, Finance Minister  Bill English  said in a fiscal plan released today in Wellington. The
budget balance will improve from a NZ$8.44 billion deficit this
year as the government curbs new spending and sells assets to
limit debt.  Prime Minister John Key’s government forecasts the nation’s
gross domestic product will grow by 3.4 percent in the fiscal
year to March 2014.  In  China , a private survey showed the nation’s
 manufacturing  may shrink for a seventh month in May, adding to
bets that the government will take further steps to spur growth.  The 48.7 preliminary reading for a purchasing managers’
index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today
compares with a final 49.3 for April. If confirmed on June 1, it
would mark the longest run of below-50 readings since the global
financial crisis.  China is  Australia ’s biggest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-largest export destination.  ‘Aggressive Policy Easing’  “We now expect more aggressive policy easing from
Beijing,” such as lowering reserve ratios, cutting  interest
rates  and increasing fiscal stimulus, said Khoon Goh, a
Sigapore-based senior foreign-exchange strategist at  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  “We could see the second quarter
being the bottom if they do all those things,” supporting the
Aussie and kiwi, he said.  Australia’s bonds rallied, pushing the yield on the 10-year
note down by one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.15
percent. It touched 3.058 percent on May 18, the lowest in data
compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1969.  New Zealand’s  two-year swap rate , a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, was unchanged at 2.385 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
