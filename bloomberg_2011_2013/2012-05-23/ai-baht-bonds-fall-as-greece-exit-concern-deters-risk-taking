(Corrects Papademos comment in fifth paragraph)  Thailand ’s baht dropped for a third
day and government bonds fell as concern mounted  Greece  will
exit the euro, deterring risk-taking.  The currency declined the most in a week after exchange
data show international investors sold $74 million more local
shares than they bought in the first two days of this week. A
government report on May 25 will say exports rose 6.4 percent in
April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 18.3 percent,
resulting in a trade deficit of $2.9 billion, according to
Bloomberg surveys of economists.  “Investors are becoming risk averse and selling riskier
assets amid lingering concern over Greece,” said Minori Uchida,
chief analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  Tokyo .
“In terms of Thailand’s recovery from the floods, it boosts
imports but external demand is not strong enough to increase
exports as much. It could be baht negative in the long run.”  The baht slumped 0.4 percent to 31.50 per dollar as of 8:44
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
reached 31.53 earlier, the weakest level since May 16. The
currency may drop to around 32 by the end of June, Uchida said.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52 percent.  Greece’s former Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said that
while it is unlikely the nation will leave the euro, it’s still
a risk, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal
yesterday.  Thailand will sell 7 billion baht ($222 million) of bonds
due 2032 and 8 billion baht of floating-rate notes due 2016
today. The yield on the 3.25 percent security due June 2017 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.57 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Thai  government bonds  look cheap,” Barclays Capital
strategists Rohit Arora, Kumar Rachapudi and  Ju Wang  wrote in a
research note released today. “For today’s auction, we expect
strong demand for the 20-year bond.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
