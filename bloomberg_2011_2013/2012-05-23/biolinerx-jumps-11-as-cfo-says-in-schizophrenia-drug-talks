BioLineRx Ltd. (BLRX)  rose the most since
February after the biopharmaceutical company said it’s in talks
with larger drugmakers interested in developing an experimental
schizophrenia pill.  The shares rose as much as 11 percent, the most since Feb.
6, to 1.06 shekels. They traded at 1.01 shekels at 2:52 p.m. in
Tel Aviv.  The drug improved patients’ cognitive function in a mid-
stage trial in 2010 and the company expects results from a more
advanced study next year, Chief Financial Officer Philip Serlin
said. Partnership talks will probably “heat up” then, he said.  BioLine, based in Jerusalem, says its BL-1020 drug may turn
out to help patients function better in daily life while anti-
psychotic medicines such as  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s Seroquel and
 Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s Risperdal help quell schizophrenia symptoms
such as hearing voices or violent outbursts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
