MetLife Inc. (MET) , the insurer planning to
cut expenses by $600 million by 2016, said the unit focusing on
sales to U.S. individuals has been targeted for savings.  About 60 percent of the reductions will be in the U.S., and
“retail will have the largest portion of this contribution,”
said William Wheeler, president of the Americas for the New
York-based insurer, in a presentation today. “We do expect our
mature businesses to shoulder most of the impact” while the
company pursues growth in other business lines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
