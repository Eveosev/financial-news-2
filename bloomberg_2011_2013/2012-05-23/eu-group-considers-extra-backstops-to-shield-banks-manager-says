A European Union expert group is
considering extra capital buffers for systemically important
banks and a new type of mandatory bond among ways to reduce the
financial institutions’ vulnerability to shocks, Manager Magazin
reported, without saying how it got the information.  The group, led by Finnish central banker Erkki Liikanen, is
evaluating additional capital measures for individual lenders as
well as a new type of debt instrument that may only be purchased
by insurers, pension funds or sovereign wealth funds, the
Hamburg-based magazine said in an excerpt of the report today.  The bonds, which would be treated as equity in the event of
a bank’s insolvency, would help reduce the cross-links between
lenders and shield them from bankruptcy fallout, Manager Magazin
said. Former  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  Chief Executive Officer  Alessandro Profumo  has left the expert group, which also includes  European
Aeronautic Defence and Space  Co. CEO  Louis Gallois , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
