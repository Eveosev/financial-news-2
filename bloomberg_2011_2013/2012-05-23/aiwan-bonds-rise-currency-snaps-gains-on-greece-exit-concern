Taiwan’s government bonds rose and
the currency snapped a two-day gain on concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis is sapping demand for the island’s goods.  The government reported today factory output contracted
2.33 percent in April from a year earlier, declining for a
second month. European leaders are meeting in Brussels today to
discuss the region’s debt crisis that has wiped almost $4
trillion from equity markets worldwide this month.  “The market’s been reflecting on a possible Greek exit,
now the problem is whether it’ll have ripple effects on other
countries,” said George Pu, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader
at Sinopac Securities Corp. “Taiwan yields have room to drop.”  The yield on the government’s 1 percent notes due January
2017 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.962
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  Taiwan ’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.586 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings traders use to price options, rose 20 basis points
to 5.5 percent.  Global funds sold $3.2 billion more Taiwanese stocks than
they bought this month, cutting net purchases for the year to
$683 million, according to exchange data.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.51 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
