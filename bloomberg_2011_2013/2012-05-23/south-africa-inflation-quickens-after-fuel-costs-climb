South Africa ’s inflation rate
increased less than economists forecast in April, adding to
expectations the central bank will leave its key interest rate
unchanged tomorrow.  Inflation accelerated to 6.1 percent from 6 percent in
March, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said on its
website today. The median estimate of 18 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 6.2 percent. Prices rose 0.4 percent in the month.  The Reserve Bank, which has kept its benchmark lending rate
unchanged at 5.5 percent since November 2010, expects inflation
to peak at 6.5 percent in the second quarter because of rising
energy costs. The bank has limited room to cut  interest rates  as
inflation stays near the top of its 3 percent to 6 percent
target band, Governor Gill Marcus said on March 8.  “It’s pretty certain that tomorrow won’t deliver any
change,” Carmen Nel, an economist at Rand Merchant Bank in  Cape
Town , said in a phone interview today. “It’s a positive
surprise relative to the  Reserve Bank ’s inflation expectation.”  The central bank will probably keep the lending rate
unchanged tomorrow, according to all 18 economists  surveyed  by
Bloomberg.  The rand was little changed at 8.3925 against the dollar as
of 11:31 a.m. in Johannesburg from 8.3904 before the data was
released. The yield on the benchmark rand bond due in 2015
gained six basis points, or 0.06 percentage points, to 6.39
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
