Alere Inc. (ALR)  is recalling 803,000 tests
used to detect heart attacks and manage heart failure patients
that failed to meet quality control guidelines.  The recall covers 104 lots of the Alere Triage BNP, Alere
Triage D-dimer and Alere Triage cardiology panels that were
produced in 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, the Waltham,
Massachusetts-based company said today in a regulatory filing.
The products failed to meet guidelines established by the  U.S.
Food and Drug Administration , the company said.  The FDA will allow new tests to be made through the end of
June under a temporary quality control system while a more
permanent process is discussed, Alere said. Production is being
increased at an additional  cost  to fill the shortfall created by
the recall, the company said. Alere didn’t disclose whether any
patients were harmed because of the flawed tests.  “Alere is currently unable to determine the outcome of
these discussion with the FDA or their impact on its future
revenues, results of operations, earnings, cash flows or
financial condition,” the company said in the filing. Doug
Guarino, an Alere spokesman, didn’t immediately return phone
calls seeking comment.  Alere  fell  2.3 percent to $18.32 at the close in  New York .
The shares have declined 54 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
