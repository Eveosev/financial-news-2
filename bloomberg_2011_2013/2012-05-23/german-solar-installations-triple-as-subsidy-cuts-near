German solar installations more than
tripled in the first quarter from a year ago as developers
rushed to take advantage of subsidies before they’re cut in the
world’s biggest market for the technology, the federal grid
regulator said.  Germany  added about 1,800 megawatts of solar panels in the
three months through March, the Bundesnetzagentur said today on
its  website . In the same period a year ago, 513 megawatts were
connected.  About 1,150 megawatts of panels were added in March after
installations of about 200 megawatts and about 450 megawatts in
February and January respectively, the regulator said.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  seeks to reduce the pace of annual
solar installations after incentives for the industry pushed new
projects to a record 7.5 gigawatts last year. Her plan to cut
subsidies by a record starting April 1 was blocked by state
leaders in the upper house on May 11. The bill was sent to a
parliamentary panel for arbitration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
