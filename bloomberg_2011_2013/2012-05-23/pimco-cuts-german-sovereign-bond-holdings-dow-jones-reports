Pacific Investment Management Co. is
cutting its German government bond holdings because the market
is overvalued,  Scott Mather , head of global bond portfolio
management, told  Dow Jones  in an interview.  He said he holds no sovereign debt from Greece, Portugal
and Ireland, and only a small amount from Italy, Spain and
 France , according to Dow Jones. Instead, heâ€™s buying U.S.
mortgage-backed securities and German, U.K. and Dutch covered
bonds, Dow Jones quoted him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
