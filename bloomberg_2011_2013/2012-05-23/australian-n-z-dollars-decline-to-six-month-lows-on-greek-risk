The Australian currency fell to its
weakest levels since November against the dollar and yen as
European leaders met in Brussels to discuss the region’s debt
crisis.  The so-called Aussie and  New Zealand ’s dollar reached their
lowest levels this year against the greenback as stocks and
commodities fell amid concern no new measures would be proposed
to stem the sovereign-debt crisis. Losses in the kiwi, as the
New Zealand currency is known, were limited before a report
today that may show the nation’s trade surplus widened in April.  “The euro seems to be leading the way in terms of  risk
aversion , and that is spilling over into all the other
currencies,” said Ravi Bharadwaj, a market analyst in
Washington at Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of
 Western Union Co. (WU)   Australia’s dollar fell 0.7 percent to 97.46 U.S. cents at
5 p.m. in  New York  yesterday. It touched 96.90, the lowest since
Nov. 25. The currency traded 1.3 percent weaker versus the yen
at 77.45 yen, after falling to a six-month low of 76.87.  New Zealand’s dollar declined 0.6 percent to 75, after
sliding to 74.57, the least since November. The kiwi fetched
59.61 yen, after declining 1.9 percent to 59.19, the lowest
since December.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks declined 1 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials weakened 1.9
percent.  Exports exceeded imports by NZ$400 million ($300 million)
in April, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Exports make up
30 percent of New Zealand’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
