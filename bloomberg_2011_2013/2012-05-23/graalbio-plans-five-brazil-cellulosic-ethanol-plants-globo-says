GraalBio Investimentos SA, the
biofuels unit of Graal Investimentos SA, plans to invest 1.5
billion reais ($724.5 million) in five ethanol plants in Brazil,
 O Globo  reported, citing company President Bernardo Gradin.  The first facility, planned for the state of Alagoas, will
be able to produce 82 million liters (21.6 million gallons) of
fuel a year from sugar-cane residues, the Rio de Janeiro-based
newspaper said in an article today. The plant is expected to
start operating in December 2013, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
