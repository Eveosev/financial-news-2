Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said the 17-nation euro area needs more fiscal
integration before common bond issuance can be considered.  Joint issuance of euro bonds “must probably come at some
point in time when we have a bigger fiscal integration,”
Frieden said in an interview today with  Maryam Nemazee  on
Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” in  London . “Right now, we
first have to fix the problems that we have in the various
countries,” he said.  “Euro bonds can add to stability, but they should not be
used to allow counties to just increase their public debt,”
Frieden said. “Euro bonds, if they are stability bonds and just
for a limited amount, are a path in the right direction.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
