Copper declined for the first time in
four days to a four-month low as concern that  Greece  may quit
the euro region outweighed a report showing an improvement in
U.S.  home sales .  The three-month delivery contract fell as much as 1.9
percent to $7,594.50 a metric ton, the lowest level since Jan.
10, on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $7,595 by 5:27
p.m. Tokyo time. July-delivery metal dropped 1.7 percent to
$3.427 a pound on the Comex.  Greece’s former Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said that
while it is unlikely the nation will leave the euro, it’s still
a risk, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal
yesterday. The concern also overshadowed speculation that  Europe 
and China will step up efforts to bolster economic growth. The
National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes
increased in April for the first time in three months, adding to
signs the U.S. housing market is recovering.  “Because of mounting concern over Greece, investors are
increasingly reluctant to take risk for a while,” said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at  Astmax Ltd. (8734)  in Tokyo. “The
downside would be limited as we’ve recently seen good support
around $7,600.”  European Union leaders will gather in Brussels to discuss
how to revive growth and grapple with a political impasse in
Greece. Europe’s crisis risks spiraling and seriously damaging
the world economy, the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said in a report yesterday.  Inventories Fall  Inventories monitored by the London Metal Exchange dropped
0.2 percent to 223,975 tons, daily exchange figures showed
yesterday. The stockpiles are down 40 percent this year. Orders
to draw copper from warehouses fell 13 percent to 30,525 tons.  Investors are closely watching  China ’s manufacturing
activity preliminary reading for May to be released tomorrow by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics, Emori said. Purchasing
managers’ index rose to 49.3 in April from 48.3 the previous
month. The reading still signaled a sixth straight month of
contraction. China is the world’s biggest consumer of industrial
metals.  The September-delivery contract on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange slumped 1.5 percent to close at 55,000  yuan  ($8,690) a
ton.  On the LME, aluminum was down 0.6 percent at $2,017 a ton,
zinc lost 1.8 percent to $1,878 a ton and lead dropped 1.7
percent to $1,931.50 a ton. Nickel fell 0.5 percent to $16,811 a
ton. Tin declined 1.8 percent to $19,360 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
