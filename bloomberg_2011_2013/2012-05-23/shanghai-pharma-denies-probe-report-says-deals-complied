Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. (601607) 
hasn’t received any notice of a probe by regulators in mainland
 China  or  Hong Kong , the company said in a response to a
newspaper report that had caused its shares to plunge.  The company complied with rules in making acquisitions, and
its accounts and those of its units comply with standards, it
said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday. The  stock 
dropped 24 percent in Hong Kong yesterday, the biggest decline
since its May 2011 debut.  The 21st Century Business Herald  reported  that Shanghai
Pharma is being investigated by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and
China Securities Regulatory Commission for suspected financial
fraud involving two acquisitions earlier this year, citing a
company executive it didn’t identify.  Shanghai Pharma said it completed the acquisition of 70
percent of Changzhou Kony Pharma Co., and the consolidation of
Kony’s accounts into its first-quarter report met standards. The
acquisition of the intangible assets of Shanghai Asia Pioneer
Pharmaceutical Co. is “fair and reasonable” and complies with
regulatory requirements, Shanghai Pharma said.  Shanghai Pharma plunged by HK$2.93 yesterday to close at
HK$9.11 in Hong Kong. In Shanghai, the shares fell 10 percent,
the exchange-imposed daily limit, to 10.75  yuan .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
