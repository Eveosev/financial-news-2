Former Moscow city mayor Yury Luzhkov
wants to build OAO United Petrochemical Co., created by
billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s OAO Bashneft and former Sibur
Holding head Yakov Goldovsky, into  Europe ’s largest
petrochemical firm, RBC Daily said, citing several unidentified
persons familiar with the matter.  Luzhkov may be elected chairman of the company, whose
shareholders meeting is scheduled for June 26. He may get a
stake in United Petrochemical provided there are at least $5
billion of investments from shareholders in the company
development plan he designed, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
