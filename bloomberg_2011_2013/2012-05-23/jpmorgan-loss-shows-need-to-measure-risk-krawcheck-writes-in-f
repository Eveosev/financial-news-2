JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s $2 billion
trading loss shows regulators need to focus on ensuring banks
have enough capital relative to their risks, rather than trying
to ban proprietary trading,  Sallie Krawcheck  wrote in a
Financial Times op-ed article.  It’s often impossible to distinguish between proprietary
trading, services for clients and hedging, said Krawcheck,
former head of Bank of America Corp.’s wealth-management
division. Regulators should instead work to measure how much
risk banks have and on improving inadequate risk measurements,
in order to guarantee lenders have the right amount of capital,
she wrote.  Bank regulators shouldn’t allow any activities that are too
complex for their risk models or stress tests to assess,
Krawcheck said. They also need to complete new regulations on
credit-rating companies, which could then act as “an unbiased
partner in assessing bank risk,” she added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
