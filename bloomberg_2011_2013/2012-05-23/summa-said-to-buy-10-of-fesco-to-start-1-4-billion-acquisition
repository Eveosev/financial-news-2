Summa Group, an investor in Russian
ports and a Rotterdam oil terminal, bought more than 10 percent
of Fesco Group in the first stage of a planned $1.4 billion deal
to gain control of the shipping company, said two people with
knowledge of the deal.  The shares Summa purchased were held as treasury stock by
Fesco, the Russian Far East shipper and port operator controlled
by businessman Sergei Generalov, the people said, declining to
be identified because the information isn’t public. Fesco also
holds 21 percent of OAO Transcontainer, a London-listed rail
freight company.  Summa, controlled by Chairman Ziyavudin Magomedov plans to
buy the remainder of the 13 percent stake Fesco holds as
treasury stock, as well as Generalov’s 56 percent of the
transportation group, the people said. That deal may close
within two weeks, they said.  Stanislav Vartanian, a vice president at Fesco, declined to
comment, as did Summa’s press service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
