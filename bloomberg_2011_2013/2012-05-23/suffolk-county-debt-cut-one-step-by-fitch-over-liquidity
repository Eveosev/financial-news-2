Suffolk County, New York, the home of
 Long Island ’s Hamptons beach communities, had its rating on $1.3
billion in general-obligation debt cut a step by  Fitch Ratings ,
which cited reduced liquidity and financial flexibility.  The A+ mark, fifth-highest and down from AA-, also applies
to $60.1 million in public improvement serial bonds the county
plans to sell by competitive bid June 6, Fitch said today in a
statement. Fitch has a negative outlook on the debt.  “Persistent operating deficits due in large part to over-
estimation of sales-tax revenues, the use of nonrecurring
revenues and increased fixed costs have led to significantly
reduced reserve levels and structural imbalance resulting in the
county declaring a fiscal emergency in March,”  Karen Wagner , a
Fitch analyst in New York, said in the report.  Citing a projected three-year deficit of as much as $530
million, Suffolk Executive Steve Bellone declared a fiscal
emergency on March 6. Bellone has proposed spreading a 2013
pension payment out over 10 years, budget cuts and putting red-
light cameras at 50 intersections as part of a plan to save
$162.3 million. A job-cut plan will erase 315 positions July 1
to save $24 million annually. The county employs 10,300 workers.  Moody’s Investors Service cut the county’s general-
obligation bond rating two levels to A1, also fifth-highest,
March 12. The company has a negative outlook, citing liquidity
concerns after recurring operating deficits reduced reserve
funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
