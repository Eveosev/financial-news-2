Copper dropped to a four-month low in
 New York  on concern that slowing growth in  China  and the risk of
 Greece  leaving the euro signal weaker demand for the metal.  European leaders meeting in Brussels are seeking to keep
Greece within the 17-nation monetary union, a day after the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said the
crisis could spiral and damage the world economy. Growth in
China, the world biggest copper user, will slow to 8.2 percent
this year from 9.2 percent in 2011, the  World Bank  said.  “Given this gloomy backdrop, we expect that markets will
continue to be on the defensive for much of this week, at least
until we see more specifics coming out from the EU policy
meeting,”  Edward Meir , an analyst at INTL FCStone in New York,
said in a report.  Copper futures for July delivery slid 2.6 percent to settle
at $3.396 a pound at 1:19 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the metal touched $3.3865, the lowest since Jan. 9.  The Chinese economy may have the worst growth in more than
two decades if Greece abandons the euro, economists at
investment bank China International Capital Corp. said in an e-
mailed report today.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, which tracks 24 raw
materials, fell as much as 2.3 percent to the lowest level this
year. It dropped 0.9 percent yesterday as the dollar rallied on
demand for a haven.  Inventories Rise  Copper  inventories  monitored by the  London  Metal Exchange
rose for the fourth time in five sessions to 225,700 metric
tons, daily exchange figures showed.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months fell 2.7
percent to $7,531 a ton ($3.42 a pound).  Aluminum for three-month delivery on the LME declined 1
percent to $2,009 a ton. Orders to draw the lightweight metal
from warehouses climbed to 1.73 million tons, the highest level
since at least 1997.  Zinc, lead, nickel and tin were also lower in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
