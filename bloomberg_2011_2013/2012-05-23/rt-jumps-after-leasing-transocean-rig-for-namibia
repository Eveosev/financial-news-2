HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA , the
oil explorer with assets in Brazil’s Amazon and Namibia, rallied
after acquiring a rig to drill off the coast of Africa.  HRT, based in  Rio de Janeiro , rose 3 percent to 309.11
reais. Earlier it rose as much as 6.7 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since May 11.  Drilling in Namibia will start late this year or early 2013
after a rig was leased from  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , HRT said in a
statement today. The company plans to sell a stake in its
Namibia oil exploration blocks in coming months, Chief Executive
Officer Marcio Mello said on a conference call today. HRT
estimates it has 28 billion barrels of potential oil and
natural-gas resources in the African country.  HRT is the worst performer of Brazil’s four publicly traded
oil companies this year after it found gas instead of oil in the
Solimoes basin in the Amazon. The stock has dropped 46 percent
this year, compared with a 4 percent increase in Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index.  State-run  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  has fallen 11 percent this
year in  Sao Paulo  trading, while billionaire Eike Batista’s  OGX
Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA  slid 15 percent and  QGEP
Participacoes SA (QGEP3)  declined 35 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
