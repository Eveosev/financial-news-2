French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault is seeking a decree to lower the retirement age to 60
for some workers within three weeks, he told RTL radio in an
interview today.  The decree should be introduced “very fast,” Ayrault was
 cited as saying  by the broadcaster. That would honor President
 Francois Hollande ’s commitment to “correct and remove an
injustice,” Ayrault said.  The plan to introduce retirement at 60 for people who
started work at the age of 18 or 19, provided they’ve made
social-security contributions for 41 years, would affect 100,000
people in the first year and cost 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion), Ayrault said, according to RTL.  The prime minister will meet with unions and employer
organizations on May 29, he said, RTL reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
