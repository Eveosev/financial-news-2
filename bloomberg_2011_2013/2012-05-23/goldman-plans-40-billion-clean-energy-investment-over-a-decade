Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, plans to spend as much as $40
billion financing renewable energy projects in the next decade.  Stuart Bernstein, global head of clean technology, will
relocate to San Francisco to lead the effort, Michael DuVally, a
spokesman for the New York-based firm, said in an e-mail.  The plans were reported earlier today by Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
