Colombia’s peso dropped the most in
six months as concern that the sovereign-debt crisis is
worsening in  Europe  sapped demand for higher-yielding assets.  The peso plunged 1.2 percent to 1,848.50 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:37 a.m. in Bogota, the biggest drop on a closing basis since
Nov. 25. The decline pared this year’s gain to 5 percent, the
third-best performance among all currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  “People are nervous  Greece  will exit the euro,” said
Lucia Duarte, a currency strategist in Bogota at  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) ,
the nation’s biggest bank. “Technical levers are favoring
declines in the peso” as investors bet on further depreciation,
she said.  The yield on the country’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due July 2024 rose 8 basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to
7.21 percent, according to the central bank. The price fell
0.754 centavo to 122.088 centavos per peso.  European leaders are meeting today to discuss the debt
crisis after deepening concern Greece will exit the euro erased
about $4 trillion from global equity markets this month. The
prospect of Greece leaving the 17-nation euro region increased
after parties opposed to terms of the nation’s second bailout by
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  won most
of the votes in May 6 elections. A new vote will be held June 17
after politicians failed to form a government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
