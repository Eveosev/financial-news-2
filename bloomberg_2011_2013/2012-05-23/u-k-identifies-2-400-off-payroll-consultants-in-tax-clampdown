U.K. Chief Secretary to the Treasury
Danny Alexander said he will prevent consultants working for
government departments from channeling their earnings through
companies and force them to pay income and payroll taxes.  More than 2,400 such individuals earning more than 58,200
pounds ($92,000) a year have been identified in a Treasury
review, Alexander told Parliament in London today. He didn’t
reveal the loss to the exchequer as a result of the practice
that allows “off payroll” consultants to pay  corporation tax 
rather than a higher income-tax rate.  “There is absolutely no place for  tax avoidance  in
government,” Alexander said. The practice has “been endemic in
the public sector for too many years.”  The clampdown follows the revelation in February that Ed
Lester, who was being paid 182,000 pounds a year to run the
Student Loans Company, was using a company to lower his tax
bill. The Treasury said it would look at others engaging in the
practice and force them on to the regular income-tax regime.  Alexander said most staff will now be put on the payroll
when working for more than six months at a department and this
will apply to new and existing contracts starting in September.  About 40 percent of those identified in the review had been
working under the arrangement for at least two years, he said.  “It is completely inappropriate for any senior permanent
position in the civil service to be held by a contractor instead
of a civil servant paying tax in the ordinary way,” Bob
Kerslake, head of the civil service, said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
