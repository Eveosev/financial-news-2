OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, led the biggest slump in Hungarian stocks in six months
on concern the European debt crisis is escalating.  OTP’s shares fell 4.6 percent to 3,374 forint by the close
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock  index  declined 3.1 percent,
the most since Nov. 2.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , Hungary’s largest refiner,
plunged 4.3 percent to 15,520 forint.  European leaders are meeting today to discuss the debt
crisis as speculation rose that Greece may leave the euro area.
Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted eastern member, has
failed to start talks on a bailout of its own for six months
since requesting the aid from the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
