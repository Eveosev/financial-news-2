Russell Martin scored the go-ahead
run on Curtis Granderson’s fifth-inning groundout as the  New
York  Yankees ended their three-game home losing streak with a
3-2 victory against the Kansas City Royals.  The Yankees (22-21) are fourth in Major League Baseball’s
five-team American League East, 5 1/2 games behind the Baltimore
Orioles.  Humberto Quintero hit a run-scoring double in the third
inning and Jeff Francoeur hit a solo home run in the fourth to
give the Royals a 2-0 lead last night at Yankee Stadium.  Robinson Cano  hit a home run in the fourth and Derek Jeter
had a run-scoring single with the bases loaded to tie the game
before Granderson’s run-scoring groundout in the fifth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
