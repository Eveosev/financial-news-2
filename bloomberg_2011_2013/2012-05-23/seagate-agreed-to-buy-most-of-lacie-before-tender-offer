Seagate Technology Plc (STX) , the world’s
largest maker of computer disk drives, has  agreed  to buy a
controlling stake in  LaCie SA (LAC)  in a deal valuing the Paris-based
manufacturer of consumer storage products at about $186 million.  Seagate offered to purchase all shares held by Philippe Spruch, LaCie’s chairman and chief executive officer, and his
affiliate, for a 64.5 percent stake, the companies said in a
statement today. Seagate agreed to pay 4.05 euros ($5.12) a
share in cash. If Seagate gains 95 percent of shares and  voting
rights  within six months, the price will increase to 4.17 euros.  LaCie will help Seagate expand in  Europe  and Japan, the
companies said. Spruch will lead Seagate’s consumer storage
products business after the deal closes.  “We just want more software talent and design talent in
the company,” Scott Horn, vice president of marketing at
Seagate, said in an interview. “It also gives us a
complimentary product line and strengthens us in southern
Europe.”  The share-purchase transaction is expected to close in the
third quarter of 2012. Seagate will then initiate a tender offer
for the remaining outstanding shares of LaCie.  Morgan Stanley advised Seagate on the deal.  Seagate fell 2.2 percent to $25.78 at the close in  New
York . The  stock  had increased 61 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
