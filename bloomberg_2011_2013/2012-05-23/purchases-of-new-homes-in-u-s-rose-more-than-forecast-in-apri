Demand for  new U.S. homes  rose more
than forecast in April, indicating residential real estate may
contribute to economic growth for the first time in seven years.  Purchases rose to a 343,000 annual rate, up 3.3 percent
from a revised 332,000 in March, the Commerce Department
reported today in Washington. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 72 economists was 335,000. Data yesterday showed
April sales of previously owned homes rose in every region.  “It’s very clear now that the housing market has turned a
corner,” said  Richard DeKaser , deputy chief economist at
Parthenon Group LLC in  Boston , who projected sales would
increase to a 339,000 pace. “The only question is how strong
the rebound is going to be. It bodes well for the broader
economy.”  Job growth, improving affordability and record-low  interest
rates  are helping propel sales at builders such as Toll Brothers
Inc. At the same time, some banks remain reluctant to lend and
foreclosures continue to move through the system, signaling a
sustained housing recovery will take time to take hold.  Stocks erased earlier losses amid optimism European leaders
will do more to halt contagion from the region’s debt crisis,
helping the market reverse a plunge triggered by growth concern
 Greece  will leave the euro. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose
0.2 percent to 1,318.86 at the close in  New York .  Elsewhere today,  Bank of England  policy makers kept open
the possibility that they may resume stimulus, saying a decision
to halt bond purchases this month was “finely balanced”
because of risks from the euro area.  Japan Exports  In  Japan , the trade deficit widened in April on lower-than-
estimated exports, underscoring risks to the economy’s recovery
a day after  Fitch Ratings  cut the nation’s debt rating.  In another sign the U.S. housing market is gaining
traction, a report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency today
showed  home prices  rose 2.7 percent in the 12 months through
March, the biggest year-over-year gain since November 2006.
Values increased in every region, led by a 4 percent jump in the
area that includes Texas and  Louisiana .  Bloomberg survey estimates for new-home sales, which are
logged when contracts are signed, ranged from 325,000 to
375,000. The Commerce Department revised the March reading up
from a previously estimated 328,000.  The median sales price increased 4.9 percent from the same
month last year, to $235,700, today’s report showed.  Purchases rose in three of four U.S. regions last month, led
by 28 percent gains in both the Midwest and West. The South was
the only area to show a decline, falling 11 percent.  Inventory Increase  The number of newly constructed houses on the market rose
to 146,000 from 144,000 in March, which was the fewest reported
in data going back to 1963. It was the first increase in
inventory since April 2007.  Because the rate of sales climbed faster than inventory,
the supply of new houses on the market dropped to 5.1 months’
worth from 5.2 months in March.  Demand for new houses peaked at 1.28 million in 2005 during
the housing boom, then fell to 306,000 in 2011, the lowest in
records dating back to 1963.  Newly constructed houses made up 6.7 percent of the
residential market last year, down from a high of 15 percent
during the boom of the past decade. Some buyers are taking
advantage of the large inventory and affordability of previously
owned homes.  Existing Houses  Sales of those  existing homes , tabulated when a contract
closes, increased 3.4 percent to a 4.62 million annual rate in
April, just shy of the 4.63 million in January that was the
highest in almost two years, the National Association of
Realtors reported earlier this week. Resales could rise to a 4.6
million to 4.7 million range this year, the group projected,
from 4.26 million in 2011.  Builder  confidence  rose to a five-year high in May, with
the National Association of Homebuilders/Well Fargo sentiment
gauge rising to 29. The measure had been as low as 14 in
September. A measure of sales expectations for the next six
months rose to 34 from a revised 31, and the gauge of buyer
traffic increased to 23, the highest since April 2007,
homebuilders reported earlier this month.  Toll Brothers (TOL) , the largest U.S. luxury-home builder, today
reported a second-quarter profit that beat estimates as sales
and orders increased amid improving demand for the company’s
move-up houses. Toll’s homes are marketed to wealthier buyers
with easier access to cash and credit. Bookings jumped 47
percent from a year earlier to 1,290 homes.  Market Strengthening  “It appears that the housing market has moved into a new
and stronger phase of recovery,” Chief Executive Officer
Douglas Yearley said in a statement. “The spring selling season
has been the most robust and sustained since the downturn
began.”  Builders  broke ground  on more homes than anticipated in
April, a Commerce Department report showed earlier this month.
Housing starts rose 2.6 percent to a 717,000 annual rate.  The last time residential construction contributed to
economic growth was in 2005, when it accounted for 0.4
percentage point of the 3.1 percent increase in  gross domestic
product . From 2006 through 2009, the homebuilding slump
subtracted 0.8 percent point from growth on average. The
declines diminished over the past two years.  Lower borrowing costs are helping underpin demand. The
average cost of a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage fell to 3.79
percent last week, an all-time low, according to a Freddie Mac
survey of lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
