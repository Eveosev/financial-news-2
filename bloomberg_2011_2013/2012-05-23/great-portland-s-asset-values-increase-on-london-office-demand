Great Portland Estates Plc (GPOR) , the real-
estate developer focused on London’s  West End , said net asset
value rose about 12 percent in fiscal 2012 as the value of its
properties and developments increased.  The net asset value at March 31 was 403 pence a share, up
from 360 pence a year earlier, the London-based company said in
a statement today. The valuation of Great Portland’s portfolio
gained 9.2 percent on a like-for-like basis.  “London continues to attract a significant flow of
investment capital from around the world,” Chief Executive
Officer Toby Courtauld said in a statement. “As a result, we
expect yields for prime assets, particularly in the West End, to
remain stable.”  Central London offices, retail and industrial units are the
only parts of the U.K. commercial property market rising in
value, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said May 15. Great
Portland reported 88 new leasings, including joint ventures,
that will generate 25.2 million pounds of rent a year.  Rents will probably rise in the next few years, “given the
scarcity of development finance and minimal development
completions” in  London , Courtauld said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
