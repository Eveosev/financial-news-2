Greece’s caretaker prime minister,
Panagiotis Pikrammenos, held meetings today with German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Francois Hollande ,
according to a Greek government official.  The 40-minute meeting with Merkel and 20-minute session
with Hollande took place in Brussels before a European Union
summit aimed at boosting economic growth and assessing the
political impasse in Greece as the country seeks to meet budget-
austerity requirements to stay in the euro, the Greek government
official told reporters on the condition of anonymity.  Pikrammenos mentioned the economic difficulties in Greece,
which is in its fifth year of recession, and told Merkel and
Hollande that visits by German and French tourists to the
country would help, said the official. The Greek leader also met
 Herman Van Rompuy , president of the 27-nation EU, and  Jose Barroso , head of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive
arm.  Pikrammenos is steering Greece to a June 17 election after
a May 6 vote failed to produce an agreement among political
parties on a new government to pursue budget cuts in return for
international aid. This month’s election catapulted a party
opposed to the rescue conditions into second place, raising
concerns that Greece may have to abandon the 17-nation euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
