Mark Lovell, an expositions promoter,
purchased the birthplace of Secretariat, the winner of horse
racing’s Triple Crown in 1973, and the Virginia State Fair
grounds for $5.35 million at a foreclosure auction.  Meadow Farm was sold yesterday by Motley’s Auction & Realty
Group.  Secretariat swept the  Kentucky Derby ,  Preakness Stakes  and
Belmont Stakes as a 3-year-old colt. Thoroughbred racing hasn’t
had a Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.  Meadow Farm was purchased by the State Fair of Virginia
Inc. in 2003 and became the home of the fair in 2009. The
property, located 26 miles north of Richmond in Doswell,
Virginia, includes 331 acres of land, a 76,000 square-foot
exhibition hall and a 12,850 square-foot manor house.  The farm, which played a central role in the 2010  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS)  movie about Secretariat, was purchased by Christopher
Chenery in 1932. He was in bad health when his daughter, Penny
Chenery, took over management of the farm and bred
Somethingroyal to Bold Ruler. Secretariat was born March 30,
1970. The stallion died Oct. 4, 1989, at Claiborne Farm in
Paris,  Kentucky .  To contact the reporter on this story:
