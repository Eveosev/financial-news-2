Hungaryâ€™s commercial banks are asking
the government to scrap a special bank levy, introduced in 2010,
in light of Cabinet plans to introduce a financial transaction
tax from January,  Magyar Nemzet  reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  Lenders are also calling for an upper limit on the
transaction tax and for private banking clients as well as
companies carrying out large financial transactions to be exempt
from the planned levy, according to the Budapest-based
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
