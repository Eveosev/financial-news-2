Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development
Co. (ALARKAN) , the company with $1 billion of debt due in 2012, sold land
to  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC)  for 742 million riyals ($198
million).  Dar Al Arkan sold the land in the Shams Al Riyadh project
in the kingdom’s capital and the transaction will be reflected
in Dar Al-Arkan’s second-quarter financial results, the company
said in a statement today. Saudi Basic, the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker, plans to use the plot to build a
residential complex for employees, it  said in separate
statement .  The real-estate developer, which was cut to neutral from
overweight at HSBC Holdings Plc in March, has a $1 billion sukuk
due in July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its
Islamic bonds maturing in 2015 were cut to hold from buy in
March by Exotix Ltd. on concern over the company’s past
financing deals.  Dar Al Arkan’s first-quarter profit rose for the first time
since at least 2009, advancing 7 percent to 292.6 million
riyals, the Riyadh-based company said last month. The yield on
its $450 million sukuk due in February 2015 declined 357 basis
points, or 3.57 percentage points, this year to 10.48 percent.  The company plans to repay about 5 billion riyals this year
as it sells land to build cash holdings, Chief Financial Officer
Andy Raheja said in an interview in February. The developer said
in March an independent assessments of a majority of its
property portfolio showed the market value is 53 percent above
the book value.  The company’s shares have risen  54 percent  in 2012 to 11.15
riyals today. That is more than five times the  Tadawul All Share
Index’s (SASEIDX)  10 percent jump.  To contact the reporters on this story:
