Germany ’s Bundesbank said the
consequences of  Greece  reneging on the terms of its bailout
program would be manageable for the euro area.  “The current situation in Greece is extremely worrying,”
the Frankfurt-based central bank said in its monthly report
today. “Greece is threatening not to implement the reform and
consolidation measures it agreed to in return for sizeable
rescue programs.”  Speculation about a Greek exit from the euro region has
increased before new elections next month that could give power
to parties opposed to austerity measures.  Greece is “jeopardizing the continuation of aid
payments,” the Bundesbank said. “Greece would have to bear the
consequences of such a decision. The challenges for the euro
area and Germany would be significant but manageable with the
help of cautious  crisis management .”  The ECB, in an effort to protect its balance sheet, last
week excluded some Greek banks from regular refinancing
operations, moving them to an emergency-liquidity program run by
the Greek central bank until they are sufficiently
recapitalized.  “In supplying extensive liquidity to Greece, the
Eurosystem believed in the implementation of the programs, and
has thus taken on considerable risks,” the Bundesbank said.
“In light of the current situation, it shouldn’t increase these
significantly any more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
