The judge investigating claims
 Liliane Bettencourt  was manipulated by those close to her is
looking into whether former French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
received illegal donations to his 2007 campaign, Le Monde said.  Judge Jean-Michel Gentil believes Bettencourt and her
husband contributed to Sarkozy and is trying to trace their cash
to see if it went illegally to the campaign, the newspaper said
today, citing documents from the inquiry in Bordeaux,  France .  Gentil is looking into whether a Bettencourt financial
adviser gave cash to Sarkozy’s party treasurer, the newspaper
said. Entries in their agendas don’t agree on details of
meetings when Gentil suspects the money was exchanged, the
newspaper said.  Sarkozy has denied in interviews that he received illegal
campaign contributions. His lawyer didn’t immediately return
calls for comment by Bloomberg News on the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
