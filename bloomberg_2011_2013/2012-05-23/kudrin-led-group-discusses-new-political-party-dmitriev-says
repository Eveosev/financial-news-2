The Civic Initiative Committee, a
group led by former Russian Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin , is
discussing a proposal to create a new political party, said a
group member, Mikhail Dmitriev.  “We need to create a party that focuses on solving
concrete, practical problems aimed at the modernization of the
country and without an ideological agenda,” Dmitriev said in an
interview today in Moscow. “It’s 100 percent clear that we need
to create such a party.”  Dmitriev, who is also the head of the Center for Strategic
Studies, a research group that advises the government, said it’s
for Kudrin to decide whether he wants to lead the party. Kudrin
left his post as finance minister last year after a public
dispute with then-President Dmitry Medvedev over plans to
increase military spending.  He has since discussed forming a political party with
billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , who ran against  Vladimir Putin 
for president in March and considered forming his own movement.  “Prokhorov’s project looks like a failure now, and it’s
time to think about a new party,” Dmitriev said. “Our
committee alone isn’t enough. We need a joint effort from a wide
circle of public forces.”  The group agreed to continue consultations over the
proposal in the future, he said.  The committee, created last April to support civic
initiatives, pledged to “oppose the actions of the
authorities” and propose “alternative ways of solving
political, economic and social problems,” according to its
April 5 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
