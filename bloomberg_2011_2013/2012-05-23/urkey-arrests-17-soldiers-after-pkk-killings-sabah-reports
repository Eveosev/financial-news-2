Turkey  arrested 17 soldiers for the
alleged murder of a hostage and two members of the Kurdistan
Workersâ€™ Party, or PKK, Sabah reported.  Authorities arrested a retired colonel and 16 active duty
members of the military following a probe into an operation in
the eastern province of Van three years ago, according to the
Istanbul-based newspaper. Prosecutors started their
investigation into the operation following a tip that the three
people were deliberately killed, Sabah  reported .  The PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by
Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union, has been fighting for
autonomy in the southeast since 1984 in a conflict that has
claimed more than 40,000 lives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
