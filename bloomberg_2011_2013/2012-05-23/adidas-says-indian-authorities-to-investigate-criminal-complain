Adidas AG (ADS) , which said last month that
it discovered irregularities at the Indian arm of its Reebok
unit, filed a criminal complaint and is working with Indian
authorities investigating the matter.  The complaint has been registered for investigation by
Indian law enforcement authorities, Adidas, based in
Herzogenaurach,  Germany , said today in an e-mailed statement.  The company, the worldâ€™s second-largest sporting-goods
maker, estimated last month that irregularities at Reebok  India 
will cost it as much as 125 million euros ($158.1 million).
Reebok has installed a new management team in India and plans to
accelerate restructuring plans, it said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
