Widespread showers are lifting crop
prospects for grains and oilseeds in northern  Europe , while
locally heavy rain in the Balkan region is boosting wheat and
rapeseed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported in its
weekly weather report.  Hot and sunny weather in Spain is speeding up ripening and
harvesting of winter grain, according to the report. Late-season
rain in Turkey benefited winter wheat and barley in the
reproductive stage, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
