Hyosung Corp. (004800) , a South Korean
chemical and trading company, may invest about $150 million in a
factory in  Romania , the Bucharest-based Economy Ministry said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Seoul-based Hyosung plans to produce tire components and
automotive airbags in Romania and seeks to start construction
works at the factory in the “next period,” according to the
statement issued after a meeting between Romania’s Delegate
Minister for Business Environment Lucian Isar and Hyosung’s
management board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
