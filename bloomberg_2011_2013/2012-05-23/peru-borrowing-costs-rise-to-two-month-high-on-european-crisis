Peru’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars rose to a two-month high as concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis will worsen should Greece leave the euro curbed demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The  extra yield  investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries climbed nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 200 at 10:54 a.m. in Lima, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the highest since Feb. 28.  European Union leaders are meeting in Brussels to discuss
ways to prevent Greece’s fiscal crisis from spreading to other
euro-zone nations.  “Lately these meetings have been non-events as they
haven’t produced clear, concrete measures,” said Roberto Flores, the head of research at Inteligo SAB, a Lima-based
brokerage. “The uncertainty is encouraging investors to seek
risk-free assets.”  The sol dropped 0.7 percent to 2.6935 per  U.S. dollar , the
weakest since January, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose two basis points to 5.23
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investor “nervousness” before elections in Greece has
fueled demand for dollars, Peru central bank President Julio Velarde told reporters yesterday. The bank is ready to lend
dollars to local banks if necessary, he said.  The central bank sold $10 million of seven-day dollar-
denominated repos yesterday, after issuing the securities for
the first time last week as the  interbank rate  for dollars
touched 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
