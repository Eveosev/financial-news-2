The 17-nation euro area has done what
it can to aid  Greece  and the country must stick to the terms of
its two European Union-led bailouts, said Finnish Prime Minister
 Jyrki Katainen .  “The euro area has done what we have to do and now we are
waiting for the Greek commitment,” he told journalists in
Brussels today before the start of dinner meeting of EU leaders.
“We cannot say that Greece would have an opportunity to say that
they don’t do what they have planned to do. We have to stick
with the package”  Katainen said that he opposes the idea of jointly issuing
bonds to finance the governments of the single currency area.  “We are not in favor of eurobonds because for too many
years too many countries have gotten loans for too cheap prices,
so I don’t want to institutionalize this problem by adding
eurobonds,” he said.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said that
tonight’s meeting should be “undramatic.” Juncker also said
that he doesn’t expect and big shift in positions on the
eurobond issue at the summit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
