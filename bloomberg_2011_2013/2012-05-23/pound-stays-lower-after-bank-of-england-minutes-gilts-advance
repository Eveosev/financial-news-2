The pound weakened against the dollar
and U.K. gilts advanced after minutes showed the Bank of England
Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 to keep the target
of its bond-purchase program at 325 billion pounds ($510
billion) at their May 9-10 meeting.  The U.K. currency fell as much as 0.5 percent to $1.5680,
the weakest since March 15, and was 0.4 percent weaker at
$1.5698 as of 9:40 a.m. London time. Sterling was little changed
at 80.47 pence per euro.  Ten-year gilt yields were five basis points lower at 1.83
percent while two-year yields fell to a record 0.267 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
