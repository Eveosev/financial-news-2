Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ,  Japan ’s second-
biggest carmaker, said it’s investing 100 million euros ($127
million) at a plant in Barcelona making electric vehicles,
creating 700 jobs.  Production of the e-NV200 model starts next year and
becomes the second fully electric vehicle produced at the plant,
according to an e-mailed statement today from Nissan. Nissan
also produces the Leaf electric car and aims to be the biggest
producer of light commercial vehicles by 2016.  “The new model will offer all the spaciousness,
versatility and practicality of a traditionally powered compact
van, but with zero CO2 emissions,” Andy Palmer, executive vice
president for Nissan, said in the statement today.  The new model is based on the existing NV200 van in
production, which has sold about 100,000 units. The jobs will be
both at the Nissan plant and with local suppliers.  Plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles have the
potential to make up 9 percent of auto sales in 2020, according
to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That could rise to 22 percent
of sales by 2030, or 4 million vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
