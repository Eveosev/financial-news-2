Cocoa arrivals from Bahia,  Brazil ’s
biggest growing region, advanced 32 percent from a week earlier,
according to analyst  Thomas Hartmann .  Deliveries to shippers and processors were 76,030 bags in
the week to May 20, Hartmann said in a report yesterday. That
compares with the 57,817 bags he reported a week earlier. Total
arrivals across Brazil were 104,824 bags from 86,622 bags a week
earlier, he said. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Bahia accounted for 74 percent of Brazil’s cocoa output and
94 percent of grindings in the past five years, Hartmann said in
an Oct. 12 e-mail. He’s a board member of the Commercial
Association of Bahia and heads the group’s statistical service
on Brazilian production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
