Soil moisture across most of  Germany 
is at 50 percent to 80 percent of field capacity, within the
optimal range for plants, forecaster Deutscher Wetterdienst
reported.  The measure is based on soil moisture for sandy loam soils,
according to the  online report  based on the situation yesterday
at 11 p.m.  Some areas in the west of Baden-Wuerttemberg and in
southern Bavaria were too wet with more than 100 percent soil
moisture, while an area on the border of Saxony-Anhalt and
Thuringia had levels of 30 to 50 percent, considered adequate
for plant growth, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
