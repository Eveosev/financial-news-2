Prada SpA (1913) , the Italian fashion
company that owns the Miu Miu and Church’s brands, plans to add
260 stores in the next three years to tap demand in  emerging
markets  including  Brazil ,  China  and Persian Gulf countries.  “We aim to speed up expansion by opening 100 stores this
year, 80 stores each in 2013 and 2014 globally,” said Chief
Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli whose company opened 75
stores last year.  Demand for Prada leather goods and other items is rising
even as China’s economic growth slows and  Europe ’s debt crisis
weighs on  consumer spending , Bertelli said. The company is
benefiting from increasingly wealthy Chinese tourists who are
fueling growth in Europe as it also targets markets in the
 Middle East , he said.  “We are expanding in Morocco, Istanbul, Beirut, Dubai and
Qatar,” Bertelli said in an interview with Bloomberg Television
conducted in Italian via a translator. “Brazil is also a big
market we’re looking at.”  The expansion would increase the number of Prada outlets to
674 by adding to the 388 directly operated stores and 26
franchises it had as of January.  The so-called BRICs take their name from the emerging
economies of Brazil, Russia,  India  and China.  Sales of discretionary goods in China will grow by a
compounded annual rate of 13.4 percent between 2010 and 2020, as
shoppers in the world’s second-largest economy become richer,
McKinsey & Co. said in a report in March. Such growth attracts
Prada, as well as Paul Smith Ltd. and Michael Kors Holdings
Ltd., to set up shops in the most populous nation.  Rising Incomes  Chinese urban disposable income rose 14 percent to about
21,810  yuan  ($3,450) in 2011.  Prada rose 0.1 percent to HK$45.70 at the close in Hong
Kong trading while the benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 0.6
percent. Shares of the company, whose $2.5 billion initial
public offering was Hong Kong’s biggest in 2011, have gained 30
percent this year.  The Milan-based company expects the sales  contribution of
the Asia Pacific region  to rise to 40 percent in 2012 and 2013,
from 35 percent last year. It plans to open 12 to 15 new stores
in China this year, and India is the next destination.  “We currently do not have any shop in India, but we are
looking to open a first store maybe in a luxury hotel in Mumbai
or New Delhi soon,” Bertelli said.  The euro has declined 11 percent against the dollar and 13
percent versus the yuan in the past year, and Bertelli said the
company may consider increasing prices by as much as 10 percent
in Europe if the single currency continues to depreciate.  Counterfeit Goods  “We need to maintain the same value,” said Bertelli, the
husband of Miuccia Prada, the designer of the brand. “We may
compensate the currency adjustment by raising prices in
Europe.”  The 66-year-old chief executive also said the company plans
to ramp up the presence of the Miu Miu brand as it is
“underpenetrated” in many countries.  While  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  was fined by France’s high appeals court
for sales of counterfeit  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) 
goods on its website, Bertelli shrugged off concerns that fake
goods could hurt the company’s sales in markets such as China.  “Fake goods aren’t totally bad, at least it created jobs
at some counterfeit factories,” said Bertelli. “We don’t want
to be a brand that nobody wants to copy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
