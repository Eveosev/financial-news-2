Chancellor Angela Merkel  said  Germany 
stood by its opposition to jointly issued euro bonds at a
European Union summit at which EU leaders aired “differing”
views on joint debt as a way to overcome the debt crisis.   “I laid out our German position, that we need a much
stronger economic cooperation in the euro area -- that we have
huge difficulties, if we think about the fiscal pact, in terms
of the treaty framework,” Merkel told reporters in Brussels
after the summit meeting.  Merkel repeated that she wants Greece to stay in the euro
area.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
