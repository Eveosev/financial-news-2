  Delek Drilling-LP (DEDRL) , a partner in
Israel’s Tamar natural gas field, dropped to its lowest level in
almost six months after the regulator said it would examine
contracts signed for domestic natural gas sales.  Delek Drilling  fell  2.9 percent to 12.44 shekels, the
lowest intraday level since Nov. 30, at 10:33 a.m. in Tel Aviv.
 Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL) , another partner in the field,
 retreated  2.8 percent to 2.29 shekels.  Isramco Negev 2 LP (ISRAL) 
retreated 2.5 percent to 0.5 shekel. The TA-25 benchmark index
was trading 0.8 percent lower.  Delek Drilling said Israel’s Antitrust Authority is
examining the contracts of the Tamar gas field partners with
Israel Electric Corp. and other utilities.  Delek Group Ltd. (DLEKG) , which has stakes in Delek and Avner,
retreated 4 percent, headed for the biggest decline since Jan.
15, to 654.70 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
