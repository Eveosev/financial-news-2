Palm oil  declined for the first time
in five days on concern that the European debt crisis will
worsen, potentially hurting demand for commodities.  The August-delivery contract fell as much as 2 percent to
3,049 ringgit ($971) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and ended the morning session at 3,061 ringgit in  Kuala
Lumpur . Futures have lost 3.6 percent this year.  The prospect of  Greece  leaving the 17-nation euro region
increased after the May 6 elections led to a hung Parliament,
with politicians failing to form a government. European Union
leaders will meet in Brussels today to discuss how to revive
growth. Palm oil exports from Indonesia may exceed 1.45 million
tons next month as a reduction in taxes spurs demand, according
to PT Sinar Mas Agro Resources and Technology.  “The economic concerns in  Europe  are having a positive
impact on the dollar, pushing commodity prices lower,” Ambika
T.B., an analyst with  Karvy Comtrade Ltd ., said in a phone
interview from Hyderabad. “A slowdown in the Chinese economy is
also worrying for palm oil.”  Commodities as measured by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index
of 24 raw materials dropped as much as 0.6 percent to 624.57,
the lowest level since Dec. 20, as the dollar strengthened
against most of its major peers.  Indonesia, the world’s largest palm oil producer, may cut
the tax on crude palm oil exports to 18 percent in June from
19.5 percent this month, Susanto, head of marketing at the
Indonesian Palm Oil Association, said yesterday.  A rally in soybean prices may boost Japan’s imports of palm
oil to a record 600,000 tons this year from 557,937 tons the
previous year, according to Yoshinori Komura, managing director
of the Japan Oilseed Processors Association said.  Soybeans for July delivery declined 0.7 percent to $13.72 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for delivery
in the same month slid 0.8 percent to 50.07 cents a pound.  Palm oil for September delivery fell 2 percent to 7,932
 yuan  ($1,253) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month declined 1.8 percent to 9,126
yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
