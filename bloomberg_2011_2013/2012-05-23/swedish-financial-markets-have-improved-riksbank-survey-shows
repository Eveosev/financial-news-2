Swedish financial markets are
functioning better than at the end of last year, a Riksbank
survey of bond and currency market participants showed.  The “extensive” lending by the  European Central Bank  was
the primary reason for the improved liquidity and increased risk
appetite in European and Swedish markets, the Stockholm-based
central bank said today, citing the survey conducted in March
and April.  The ECB lent 1.02 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) in three-
year cash in December and February to help calm financial
markets. The Greek election has since renewed speculation the
country will exit the euro, while a recession and loan losses
led Moody’s Investors Service to downgrade 16 Spanish banks on
May 17.  Almost $4 trillion has been wiped from global equity
markets this month. On May 9, the Euro Stoxx Banks index dropped
beneath the lows of March 2009, while  Sweden ’s  benchmark index 
has declined more than 7 percent this month.  The functioning of the Swedish markets will remain the same
in the next six months since sovereign debt concerns in some
euro area countries will remain for a long time, according to
most of the respondents in the survey. They predicted their
degree of risk-taking will remain unchanged in the next half
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
