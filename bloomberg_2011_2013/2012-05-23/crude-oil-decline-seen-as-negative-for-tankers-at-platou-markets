A decline in  oil prices  is negative
for tankers that haul crude because it may encourage OPEC
members to cut shipments, Oslo-based investment bank RS Platou
Markets AS said in an e-mailed report today.  Brent crude oil traded in  London  has declined 15 percent to
$107.26 a barrel since March 13. The 12 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 31.4
million barrels a day in April, the most since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
