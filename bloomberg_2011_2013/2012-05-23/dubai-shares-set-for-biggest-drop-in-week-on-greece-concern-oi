Dubai’s shares fell the most in a
week, leading a decline in most Persian Gulf markets, as concern
grew that Greece may exit the euro and oil prices fell.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper in Dubai, slumped the most since May 2.  Gulf
Navigation Holding (GULFNAV) , a company specialized in the shipping of oil
and chemicals, dropped 2.7 percent. The benchmark  DFM General
Index (DFMGI)  decreased 1.1 percent, the biggest retreat since May 16,
to 1,480.1 at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The  Bloomberg GCC
200 Index (BGCC200)  slipped 0.3 percent at 1:25 p.m. in Riyadh.  “The market is down on concern about Greece’s exit, and
weak oil prices,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-
based Al Fajer Securities. “Also the sharp drop in Asian
markets and weak U.S.” future indexes “is not helping
sentiment.”  Oil slid for a second day after U.S. crude stockpiles rose
and  Iran  agreed to grant United Nations inspectors access to the
country’s Parchin military complex. Crude for July delivery fell
as much as 1 percent to $90.71 a barrel. The Gulf Cooperation
Council, which includes  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait, sits on one-fifth of the
world’s proven oil reserves.  Greek Exit  European leaders are meeting in Brussels today to discuss
the region’s debt crisis that has wiped more than $4 trillion
from equity markets worldwide this month. Greece will hold
elections on June 17 after an inconclusive ballot revived
concerns the country will drop out of the euro area.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.6 percent and the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  tumbled 2 percent. European stocks also
declined, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index falling 1.5 percent.
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures  retreated 0.7 percent.  Emaar lost 2.4 percent to 2.90 dirhams, while Gulf
Navigation declined to 25.3 fils. There are 100 fils to the
dirham.  Kuwait’s measure fell 0.2 percent, Qatar’s QE Index lost
0.4 percent and Oman’s MSM30 Index dropped 0.5 percent. Saudi
Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index decreased 0.7 percent. Abu
Dhabi’s ADX General Index gained 0.2 percent while Bahrain’s
measure was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
