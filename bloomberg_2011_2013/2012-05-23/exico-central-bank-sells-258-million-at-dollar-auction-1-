Mexico ’s central bank sold dollars
for the first time since 2009 to prop up the peso after it
plunged to a six-month low.  The bank sold $258 million at an average  exchange rate  of
14.01 pesos per dollar, according to a statement on its website.
Since November, it has been offering $400 million daily at an
exchange rate that’s at least 2 percent weaker than the previous
day’s official fix level. That rate was 13.7203 yesterday.
Mexico’s peso pared losses after touching its lowest level in
almost six months.  “The idea is to prevent speculators from artificially
taking the exchange rate to levels that are too high,” Mario Copca, a currency strategist at Metanalisis SA, said in a
telephone interview from Mexico City. “We saw it function.”  Mexico’s currency has lost 5.8 percent over the past month
as concern mounts that newly elected European leaders will shun
austerity measures and that  Greece  will exit the euro. Concern
that  Europe ’s debt crisis would drag on global growth and
Mexican exports helped make the peso the worst performing major
Latin American currency in 2011.  The currency dropped 0.6 percent to 13.9887 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City. Earlier today, the currency fell to
14.0775, the weakest since Nov. 28.  The bank sold dollars in the second of three daily auctions
it held today.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.27 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.47
centavo to 132.38 centavos per peso.  The central bank last sold dollars on Dec. 17, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
