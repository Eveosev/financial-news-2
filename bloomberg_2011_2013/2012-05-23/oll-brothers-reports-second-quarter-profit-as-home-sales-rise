Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, reported a second-quarter profit that beat
estimates as orders jumped in an improving housing market.  Net income was $16.9 million, or 10 cents a share, for the
three months through April, compared with a loss of $20.8
million, or 12 cents, a year earlier, the company said today in
a statement. The average  estimate  of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey was for a profit of 3 cents a share.  The U.S. housing market is stabilizing as rising  employment 
and record-low  mortgage  rates lure buyers. Toll Brothers, based
in Horsham,  Pennsylvania , benefits from increased demand for
move-up homes and a wealthier customer base with access to cash
and credit. The company said quarterly orders surged 47 percent
from a year earlier in a “robust” spring selling season.  “Orders were the belle of the ball,” Stephen East, an
analyst with International Strategy & Investment Group LLC,
wrote in a note today. “This sits distinctly at the top of our
rosy expectation.”  U.S. purchases of  new homes  in April increased 3.3 percent
from the previous month to an annual pace of 343,000, the
Commerce Department said today. The rate was 316,000 a year
earlier.  Rising Sales  The improving real estate market is enabling buyers to sell
starter houses and move up to larger properties, including those
offered by Toll. Sales of  previously owned homes  rose 3.4
percent in April to a 4.62 million annual rate, the first
increase in three months, the National Association of Realtors
said yesterday in  Washington .  Toll’s homebuilding revenue for the quarter increased 17
percent from a year earlier to $373.7 million. Closings rose 14
percent to 671 homes.  Orders climbed to 1,290 homes from 879 a year earlier. The
company’s backlog, an indication of future sales, rose 37
percent to 2,403 homes. By value, the backlog jumped 49 percent
to $1.5 billion.  “It appears that the housing market has moved into a new
and stronger phase of recovery,” Chief Executive Officer
Douglas Yearley said in the statement. “The spring selling
season has been the most robust and sustained since the downturn
began.”  The average price of a Toll Brothers home under contract
was $585,000 in the second quarter. The company said the average
price of closings in the next two quarters will be between
$560,000 and $580,000. The company expects to deliver 2,700 to
3,200 homes in fiscal 2012, with closings in the fourth quarter
about 10 percent higher than in the third.  Toll rose 2.7 percent to $27.75 today in  New York . The
shares have gained 36 percent this year, matching the advance in
the 11-member Standard & Poor’s 1500 Homebuilding index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
