A study by the Centres for Cities,
with support from the British Council for Offices, describes a
“striking mismatch” between U.K. communities where offices are
being built and those where they are needed, the Financial Times
reported.  Eight of ten fast-growing medium-sized towns experienced
below-average office space growth over the past decade, while
towns with weaker economies have seen the greatest floor space
expansion, the FT said.  Report says the office-space shortage could retard the
country’s economic growth, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
