Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) ,  Spain ’s
biggest maker of wind turbines, replaced Chief Executive Officer
Jorge Calvet after the company’s market value plunged 89 percent
during his 31-month tenure.  Gamesa named as his replacement Ignacio Martin, a former
CEO of the Spanish supplier of automobile components  Cie
Automotive SA (CIE) , according to a statement yesterday. Calvet is
leaving the company. Gamesa rose 2.9 percent to 1.639 euros at
the close in  Madrid  today.  The wind company’s profit has declined since Calvet was
promoted to CEO in October 2009 as a glut of manufacturing
capacity worldwide cut turbine prices and margins. In March,
Gamesa reported its first quarterly  loss  in at least a decade.
Its shares have fallen about 75 percent in the past year.  “Whenever you have companies that aren’t doing well, you
look for a scapegoat,” Amy Grace, a wind analyst at Bloomberg
New Energy Finance, said in a telephone interview. “I wouldn’t
be surprised if you see other firings as well because of the
problems in the industry.”  The average  price  of  wind turbines  fell 3 percent in the
second half of 2011 from the previous six months to 910,000
euros ($1.14 million) a megawatt as Chinese manufacturers
undercut European rivals like Gamesa and Aarhus, Denmark-based
 Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the biggest turbine maker. Prices are
down 25 percent from a mid-2009 high of 1.21 million euros a
megawatt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vestas Comparison  Vestas’s Acting Chief Financial Officer Henrik Norremark
resigned in February before Vestas posted a loss in 2011 four
times wider than analysts predicted. He had remained in the post
after being promoted to Deputy Chief Executive Officer a month
earlier. Its CEO Ditlev Engel fired 2,335 workers worldwide in
January and said he won’t resign.  Gamesa reported a loss of 21 million euros in the first
quarter, compared with net income of 13 million euros a year
earlier. Its profit margin fell to negative 2.7 percent,
compared with 1.7 percent in 2011 and 3.6 percent in 2009.  “I am taking over at a company that successfully managed a
buoyant economic period,” Martin said in the statement. “Now
that the expansion stage is behind us, it is time to focus and
place more emphasis on competitiveness and profitability.”  The Bloomberg Wind Energy  Index (BWIND)  of 64 companies declined
0.8 percent yesterday to 427.77. It has dropped 28 percent in
the last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
