Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS (FROTO) , the maker of
Ford vehicles in  Turkey , rose to the highest in almost two
months after  Ford Motor Co. (F)  was raised to investment grade by
Moody’s Investors Service.  The shares gained 0.6 percent to 16.60 liras at the close
in Istanbul, the highest price since March 30. The  ISE National
100 Index (XU100)  plunged 2.4 percent to 55,734.34, its biggest loss
since Jan. 4.  Moody’s boosted Ford’s senior unsecured ratings two levels
to Baa3 from Ba2 and raised its finance arm, Ford Motor Credit,
to Baa3 from Ba1. Moody’s followed  Fitch Ratings  in assigning an
investment-grade status. With two such ratings, Ford regains
control of the logo and other assets pledged as collateral to
obtain a $23.4 billion loan to keep the business going in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
