Britain’s parliamentary watchdog
attacked the revenue and customs office for advising government
consultants to set up companies to lower their income-tax bills.  “We are shocked that the department appears to have
advised senior public-sector employees that is was appropriate
for them to avoid tax by using a managed service company,” the
Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons said in a
report published in  London  today.  Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said
yesterday he will prevent consultants working for government
departments from channeling their earnings through companies and
force them to pay income and payroll taxes.  More than 2,400 such individuals earning more than 58,200
pounds ($92,000) a year have been identified in a Treasury
review. Alexander didn’t reveal the loss to the exchequer as a
result of the practice that allows “off payroll” consultants
to pay  corporation tax  rather than a higher income-tax rate.  The Public Accounts Committee praised efforts to clamp down
on  tax evasion  and avoidance, saying it had raised 4.32 billion
pounds of the estimated 35 billion pounds that goes uncollected
each year. A further 1.1 billion pounds could have been raised
had the revenue and customs agency not cut 3,300 jobs, the
watchdog said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
