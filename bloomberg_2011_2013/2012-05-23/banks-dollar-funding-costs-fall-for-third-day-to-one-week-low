The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars rose from the lowest in more than a week as European
leaders prepared to meet in Brussels to discuss the crisis in
the 17-nation currency zone.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 49 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate from minus 47
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The one-year
basis swap was 68 basis points below Euribor from minus 66. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ willingness to lend to each other was
little changed for the 14th day with the Euribor/OIS spread, the
difference between the benchmark rate and overnight indexed
swaps, holding at 38 basis points. A decline signals banks are
more willing to lend.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps -- known as the FRA/OIS
spread -- were 34 basis points, the lowest since May 10, from 35
yesterday at 4:20 p.m. in  London .  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 764 billion euros ($968
billion) from 768 billion euros the day before.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for loans
over that period in euros, fell to 0.680 percent from 0.681
percent. One-week Euribor rose to 0.318 percent from 0.317
percent.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged at 0.467 percent for the fifth
day. The three-month dollar  FRA/OIS spread  was 48 basis points
from 46 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
