Canadian stocks  rose a second
straight day, wiping out a 1.7 percent retreat in the Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Composite Index, as raw-material companies and banks
reversed losses amid optimism about the Europe crisis.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ,  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  and  Yamana Gold Inc. (YRI) 
increased at least 4.8 percent as the S&P/TSX Gold Index rallied
4.9 percent to the highest level since May 2.  Premier Gold Mines
Ltd. (PG)  surged 20 percent after finding “gold-bearing structures”
at a site. Royal Bank of Canada and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  gained
at least 1.2 percent.  Romarco Minerals Inc. (R)  lost 25 percent
after saying a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers environmental
assessment for a gold project will take longer than expected.  The  S&P/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 113.02 points, or 1
percent, to 11,564.80. Its 2.5 percent increase this week is the
biggest jump over two days since Jan. 3. The benchmark gauge
surged 1.5 percent yesterday, the most in more than a month, and
hadn’t posted back-to-back gains since the beginning of May.  “You have people thinking the Greek story is overplayed
going into the weekend,”  Andrew Pyle , an associate money
manager on a Bank of Nova Scotia team that oversees about C$200
million ($200 million), said in a phone interview. “A lot of
people are taking a step back and saying that the probability of
an exit by Greece from the euro over the weekend is still pretty
low. You’re also seeing some late-day cherry picking in terms of
value players coming back into the market.”  Weekly Declines  The benchmark gauge on May 18 completed a third straight
weekly decline as concerns mounted that the Greek debt crisis,
European elections and a slowing Chinese economy may curb demand
for commodities.  Materials companies in the S&P/TSX recovered from a 2.2
percent decline earlier in the day, posting a second straight
rally, as gold and copper producers rose.  Barrick Gold, the world’s largest producer of the metal,
climbed 6.7 percent to C$40.55. Goldcorp, the second-largest
producer of the metal, rose 7 percent to C$38.40. Yamana Gold,
Canada’s third-largest company in the industry by market value,
gained 4.8 percent to C$14.85.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , the country’s biggest base-metals
producer, rose 4.9 percent to C$31.46.  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest publicly traded copper producer,
gained 5.8 percent to C$18.82.  Premier Gold Mines surged 20 percent to C$4.35 after
finding “gold-bearing structures” during a construction
project linking the Red Lake Gold Mines and Cochenour sites.  Wetlands Permit  Romarco Minerals, which is developing a gold project in
South Carolina, plunged 25 percent to 61 Canadian cents after
saying it will not receive a decision on a Federal 404 Wetlands
permit for its Haile gold project until August 2013. The
timetable is “longer than we have been targeting,” President
and Chief Executive Officer Diane Garrett said in a statement.  Financial stocks in the S&P/TSX rose for a second
consecutive session after decreasing as much as 1.4 percent
earlier in the day. The group fell for five straight sessions
last week.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the nation’s biggest lender, rose 1.4
percent to C$52.90. Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada’s second-
largest lender, increased 1.2 percent to C$78.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
