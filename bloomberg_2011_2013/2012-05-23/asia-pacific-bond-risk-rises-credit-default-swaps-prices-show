The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 5.5 basis points to 198 basis
points as of 8:32 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices
show. The index reached a four-month high of 200.3 on May 18,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 2 basis points to
209 as of 9:45 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. The
benchmark dropped 7.9 basis points yesterday, the biggest one-
day decrease since March 27, according to CMA, which is owned by
CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose 3 basis points to
197 basis points as of 10:32 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole
prices show. The gauge reached 201 basis points on May 18, its
highest since Nov. 29, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
