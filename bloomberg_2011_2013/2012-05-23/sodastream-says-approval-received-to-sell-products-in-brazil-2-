SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) , the
Israeli maker of soda machines, has received approval to sell
its products in  Brazil , Yonah Lloyd, executive director of
corporate development and communication, said.  The company expects to start rolling out its products at
200 stores across Brazil by June 13, Lloyd said in an interview.
Items to be sold include four types of soda machines and 12
flavors, and a gas canister exchange system will be put in
place, he said.  “We’re selling our higher-end machines to start with,”
Lloyd said. “We have plans to add more of our products later
this year.”  Shares of SodaStream, based in Airport City, Israel, surged
4.5 percent to $33.20 in New York, paring an earlier drop of as
much as 2.5 percent.  SodaStream products, including Kraft’s Crystal Light and
Country Time beverage mixes, will be in  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s
locations this week and on the shelves in the next few days,
Lloyd said today. Crystal Light products will also be sold
through other vendors SodaStream is partnered with, including
