The Serbian dinar fell to a record-
low against the euro today, extending declines for a third
session amid uncertainty over who will form a government after
an inconclusive May 6 parliamentary election and the victory of
opposition leader in a May 20 presidential runoff.  The currency lost as much as 1 percent from yesterday’s
official close to touch 115.9075 before rebounding to trade at
115.8419 at 10:16 a.m. in Belgrade, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The fall prompted the National Bank of  Serbia  to sell
euros, Ljiljana Grubic, chief analyst at Belgrade-based
Raiffeisen Banka AD said, adding that “interventions may only
slow the dinar weakening, but won’t resolve problems” including
weak export and credit activity.  Serbian opposition leader  Tomislav Nikolic ’s upset
presidential victory over incumbent President  Boris Tadic 
deepened the former Yugoslav republic’s political stalemate.  Nikolic is expected to find it difficult to name a
candidate for prime minister who would be able to secure a
parliamentary majority following the vote for legislators. Both
Nikolic’s Progressive Party and Tadic’s Democratic Party lack a
majority needed to confirm a new government.  The central bank has sold 898.5 million euros ($1.1
billion) this year so far to prop up the dinar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
