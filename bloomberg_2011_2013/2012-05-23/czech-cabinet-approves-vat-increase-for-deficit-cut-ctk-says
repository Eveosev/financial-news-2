The Czech government approved tax
changes aimed at reducing the budget deficit, including an
increase in the value-added tax, the  CTK  newswire reported,
citing an unidentified person with knowledge of Cabinet
deliberations.  According to the bill, which needs to be approved by
parliament to become effective, VAT rates will rise by one
percentage point to 15 percent and 21 percent from 2013, CTK
said. Other changes include a temporary abolition of the ceiling
for compulsory health-insurance payments, the newswire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
