Argentina ’s federal tax agency
yesterday shut down two exchange houses that illegally traded
dollars, according to a statement e-mailed by the agency today.  The businesses in the neighborhood of Palermo,  Buenos
Aires , were selling dollars at 6 pesos each, the agency said in
the statement. The rate was 34 percent higher than yesterday’s
official peso rate of 4.4663 per dollar.  Agency officials, who pretended to be clients, found the
exchange houses didn’t have the required central bank
authorization to trade currency and didn’t issue receipts for
transactions, the agency said.  Tax officials last week arrested four people offering to
buy and sell dollars on the streets of Buenos Aires. Illegal
currency trading is punishable by prison sentences of as long as
eight years under an anti-terrorism law introduced last year.  An illegal market in foreign currency has flourished since
November, when President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  ordered
that all currency transactions require tax agency approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
