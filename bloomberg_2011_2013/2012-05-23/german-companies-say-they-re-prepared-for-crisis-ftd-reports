German companies say they’re strong
enough to withstand the region’s fiscal crisis,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing a survey of 896 company executives.  Two-thirds of the companies won’t have to make any or only
minimal organizational changes in the short term even as
economic conditions worsen, the newspaper said. Seven percent
said they expect their business to pick up as a consequence of
the crisis, according to FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
