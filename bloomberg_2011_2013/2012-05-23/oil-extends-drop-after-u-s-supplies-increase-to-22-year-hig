Crude oil futures extended declines
after the U.S. Energy Department said stockpiles rose to a 22-
year high.  Supplies climbed 883,000 barrels to 382.5 million barrels.
Inventories were forecast to gain 1.65 million barrels,
according to the median of 12 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Gasoline inventories  fell 3.3 million barrels to 201
million last week, the Energy Department said today. Stockpiles
were forecast to slip 650,000 barrels, according to the median
of 12 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Distillate supplies, which include heating oil and diesel,
fell 309,000 barrels to 119.5 million. Stockpiles were estimated
to decrease 500,000 barrels.  Crude oil for July delivery fell $1.37, or 1.5 percent, to
$90.29 a barrel at 10:40 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Oil traded at $90.71 a barrel before release of the
inventory report at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.  Oil also fell as European Union leaders are gathering in
Brussels tnnight to discuss the euro-region’s debt troubles and
after  Iran  agreed to grant access to United Nations nuclear
inspectors.  The summit is the 18th since Greece was convulsed by debt
and the first since an anti-austerity campaign carried  Francois Hollande  to France’s presidency.  European Summit  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is facing calls for
measures she opposes, including euro bonds, the use of European
money to recapitalize banks, a bigger rescue fund and extra time
for debt-swamped countries to cut spending.  “The moves in just about all the markets are related to
what’s going on in Europe,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst at
futures brokerage PFGBest in Chicago. “There’s a little bit of
optimism that the Iran talks will succeed.”  The  International Atomic Energy Agency  will be given access
to Iran’s Parchin military complex, Director General Yukiya Amano said yesterday. World powers resumed talks with officials
from the Islamic republic in Baghdad today. Iran is suspected by
the U.S. and its allies to have worked on the trigger for an
atomic bomb at Parchin.  The Baghdad talks between Iran and the U.S., U.K., France,
Russia,  China  and Germany follow an April 14 gathering in
Istanbul where the sides failed to produce an accord.
Discussions last month were described as “constructive.” The
talks will extend into a second day tomorrow, Iranian state-run
Press TV reported without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
