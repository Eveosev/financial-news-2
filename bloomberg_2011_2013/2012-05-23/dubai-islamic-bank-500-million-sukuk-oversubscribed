Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  said demand
for its Islamic bond exceeded the $500 million on sale by four
times.  The issue, the lender’s first since March 2007, was priced
at 365 basis points above the benchmark midswap rate and was the
most expensive sale by a bank in the Persian Gulf this year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The new issue is driven by the need to maintain a
presence in the international debt capital markets and a prudent
strategy to diversifying our funding sources,” Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Adnan Chilwan said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Investors from the  Middle East  bought 73 percent of the
bonds, while 15 percent was sold to buyers from  Europe  and 12
percent from Asia. Banks comprised 61 percent of investors,
funds 24 percent, private banks 8 percent, and sovereign and
supra national agencies 7 percent, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
