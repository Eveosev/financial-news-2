India ’s rupee dropped to a record low
as investors favored the perceived safety of the dollar over
emerging-market assets on concern  Greece  will leave  Europe ’s
currency union.  Greece’s former Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said that
while it is unlikely the nation will leave the euro, it’s still
a risk, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal
yesterday. The  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against
those of six major trading partners, rose 0.2 percent to a 20-
month high. The rupee pared losses on speculation the central
bank intervened in the market to support the currency.  “The external situation is negative and will keep the
rupee under pressure,” said Kamlakar Rao, head of foreign-
exchange trading in Mumbai at state-run  Allahabad Bank. (ALBK)  “The
market is speculating that we’re seeing RBI intervention.”  The rupee declined 0.5 percent to 55.6475 per dollar as of
9:28 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
fell to an all-time low of 55.8275 earlier. The rupee’s one-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, rose 80 basis points, or 0.8 percentage point,
to this year’s high of 14.3 percent.  Swings in the rupee may widen because exporters must meet a
new central bank rule today that requires them to convert a
minimum of 50 percent of their overseas earnings, Rao said. The
central bank announced the regulation on May 10.  Six-month onshore currency forwards traded at 57.54 a
dollar, compared with 57.20 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 57.79 from 57.46. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
