Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said he didn’t ask the 17 members of the single currency
region to prepare contingency plans for the possibility of
 Greece  leaving the euro.  “I did not ask the member states of the euro area to
prepare national contingency plans, but of course we have to
consider all kinds of events, but our working assumption is that
Greece will stay as a member of the euro area,” he said today
after a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.  “It is our common political willingness to do everything
possible in order to retain Greece as a member of the euro
are.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
