The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars fell to their lowest levels this year as concern
European Union leaders will struggle to resolve the euro-area
debt crisis at a summit today curbed demand for riskier assets.  The so-called Aussie slid versus all but one of its 16
major counterparts as European Council President  Herman Van Rompuy  damped expectations for the 27-nation gathering starting
at 7 p.m. in Brussels. New Zealand’s currency declined to the
weakest level since December as Asian stocks retreated and
commodities fell.  “We’re just lost in this fog of  Europe , and speculation
regarding tonight’s meeting of European leaders is all over the
place,” said Hans Kunnen, chief economist at St. George Bank
Ltd. in Sydney. “We’re back on the risk-off psychology, which
suggests that the Aussie is likely to see weakness today.”  Australia ’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to 97.72 U.S. cents as
of 4:25 p.m. in Sydney after earlier dropping to 97.42 cents,
matching the low reached on Nov. 28. It declined 1 percent to
77.66 yen. New Zealand’s currency slid 0.4 percent to 75.15 U.S.
cents, after touching 74.88, the weakest since Dec. 15. The so-
called kiwi bought 59.74 yen, 1 percent below yesterday’s close.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares dropped 1.6 percent.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks failed to
maintain an intraday gain of as much as 1 percent yesterday,
closing the session little changed from the previous day.  Oil fell 0.7 percent, extending losses into a second day.
Copper slid 1.5 percent, dropping for the first time in four
days.  Yields Fall  Australia’s bonds rallied, pushing the yield on the 10-year
note down by four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
3.17 percent. It touched 3.058 percent on May 18, the lowest in
data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1969. The rate on the
nation’s two-year security slid to as low as 2.399 percent
today, the least since 2009.  New Zealand’s  two-year swap rate , a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, dropped 5 1/2 basis points to 2.385
percent.  The crisis in the 17-nation euro bloc will come up at
tonight’s meeting only “at the very end,”  Van Rompuy  said in a
 pre-summit letter . Officials are eyeing the next gathering on
June 28-29 as the time to take pro-growth steps.  The summit takes place as  Greece  prepares to hold new
elections on June 17 after an anti-bailout party surged to
second place in balloting on May 6 and denied a parliamentary
majority to the two parties that have dominated the country
since the 1970s.  Greek Exit  CNBC reported that former Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said there are no preparations underway in his nation
for a possible euro exit. Greece’s departure from the currency
bloc is “unlikely to materialize” and is an “unwanted
scenario,” CNBC cited Papademos as saying.  Spain , in the meantime, is embarking on its fourth attempt
in three years to shore up lenders saddled with about 184
billion euros ($233 billion) of what the Bank of Spain calls
“problematic” real estate-linked assets.  The Aussie has lost 3.1 percent this year, the worst
performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The kiwi declined 2
percent in the same period.  Australia’s  unemployment rate  will rise to 5.7 percent in
2013 from 5.4 percent this year as industries other than mining
struggle with an elevated currency, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said in its economic
outlook released in Paris yesterday. The OECD’s prediction for
the jobless rate would match a level reached in September 2009.  High Exchange Rate  “Mining expansion will continue, but some other sectors
are having to adjust to the high level of the  exchange rate  and
raise their productivity, which can be expected to weigh on the
labor market,” the OECD said in the report. “Faster fiscal
consolidation will also weigh somewhat on demand.”  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s government plans a A$46
billion ($44.9 billion) swing to a  budget surplus  in the fiscal
year beginning July 1.  An index of leading economic indicators by  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne Institute in Sydney climbed 0.4 percent in
March after stalling in the previous month, according to data
released today. A similar gauge by the New York-based Conference
Board advanced 0.2 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
