Brazil’s growth forecast for 2012 was
cut to 3 percent from 3.2 percent by  Standard & Poor’s , which
cited competition from imports.  “Growth in Brazil continues to struggle,” Lisa Schineller, a New York-based analyst with S&P wrote in an e-
mailed report. “Brazilian manufacturing remains under pressure
from imports.”  Schineller increased Mexico’s growth outlook for this year
to 3.4 percent from 3 percent on stronger domestic demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
