Romania’s leu dropped to the weakest
on record against the euro, sliding for a third day on
speculation  Greece  may be on its way out of the 17-nation euro
group, as European leaders meet in Brussels.  The leu fell as much as 0.22 percent today to 4.4644 per
euro, its lowest intraday level since Bloomberg started tracking
the currency in 1999. It traded 0.13 percent down to 4.4608 per
euro as of 10:55 a.m. in Bucharest.  “The leu’s evolution perspectives have changed radically
in the last month, as Greek political leaders failed” to assure
investors “that bailout terms will be followed,” analysts at
 OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ’s Romanian unit wrote in a note to clients today.
“The Greek exit would mean lower foreign investments, lower
exports and deleveraging for Romania.”  European leaders are in Brussels today to discuss  Europe ’s
debt crisis that has wiped more than $4 trillion from equity
markets worldwide this month. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
has been unable to stifle calls for measures she opposes,
including euro bonds, the use of European money to recapitalize
banks, a bigger rescue fund and extra time for debt-swamped
countries to cut spending.  Greek banks control about 16 percent of the Romanian
banking system, according to central bank data. Greece’s
Financial Stability Fund approved yesterday an 18 billion-euro
($23 billion) capital boost for the country’s four biggest
banks, all of which are also present in  Romania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
