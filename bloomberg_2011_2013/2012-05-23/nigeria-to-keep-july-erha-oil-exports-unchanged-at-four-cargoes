Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to keep July exports of Erha crude unchanged at
four cargoes, a loading plan obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  The nation will also ship four Escravos, three Antan and
two Okwori consignments, according to separate plans. Cargo
sizes range from 300,000 barrels to 1 million barrels.  Shipping schedules of Abo, Akpo, Amenam, Brass River, EA,
Okono and Pennington are not released yet. Loading programs are
monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by field operators
to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and trading
activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
