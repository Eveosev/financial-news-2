Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for the
first time in three days after coffee and tea prices increased,
leading to a higher inflow of dollars.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.3 percent to 84.90 per dollar and was trading 0.2
percent higher at 85 by 11:58 a.m. in Nairobi.  Coffee prices climbed 2.7 percent at an auction yesterday,
