Treasuries rose, with 10-year notes
snapping a three-day decline, before European leaders meet for a
summit in Brussels to address the region’s debt crisis.  Five-year note yields traded almost the lowest levels since
February as the U.S. prepares to sell $35 billion of the
securities at what may be a record low auction yield, after
demand approached the most ever at a two-year note sale
yesterday. The  Federal Reserve  purchased $1.8 billion of
securities in the first of two operations of up to $7 billion.  “There’s a pulling back of expectations that we will see
anything useful out of the European leaders summit this
afternoon,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at
CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “There’s a
general shifting back to a bit of a risk-off mode. Given the
global demand for Treasuries, we anticipate strong non-dealer
sponsorship at the auction.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.72 percent at 11:08 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
due in May 2022 rose 15/32, or $4.69 per $1,000 face amount, to
100 9/32. The yield dropped as low as 1.71 percent, approaching
the record 1.67 percent set on Sept. 23.  Thirty-year bonds rose as much as one point, pushing yields
down seven basis points to 2.80 percent.  Technical Levels  The “level to watch” on the 10-year note yield would be
the record low,  Tom Fitzpatrick  and Shyam Devani, technical
strategists at Citigroup Global Markets, wrote in a research
note. “A breach of that would be a real concern as it would
open the way for the 1.2 percent area.”  The yield on the five-year note fell two basis points to
0.73 percent. It touched 0.7032 percent on May 15, the lowest
since Feb. 3.  Treasuries have returned 0.8 percent this month, and 8.7
percent over the past year, according to indexes compiled by
Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The five-year notes being sold today yielded 0.76 percent
in pre-auction trading, poised to break the all-time auction low
of 0.88 percent set in December.  Investors  bid  for 3.09 times the amount offered at the
previous sale of the securities April 25, versus the average of
2.93 for the past 10 auctions.  “There’s cash on the sidelines and the five-year is a good
place to invest it,” said  Michael Franzese , managing director
and head of Treasury trading at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in
New York.  Auction Bids  At yesterday’s $35 billion two-year sale, investors  bid  for
3.95 times the amount of securities available, the most since
the record high of 4.07 in November.  The government is scheduled to conclude this week’s
auctions with $29 billion of seven-year securities tomorrow.  Refuge from the region’s crisis also drove investor demand
at an auction in  Germany , which received bids for more than the
maximum 5 billion-euro ($6.3 billion) target at a note sale,
with the yield falling to a record.  Germany, the only country in the euro area with a stable
outlook on its AAA rating, sold 4.56 billion euros of two-year
securities carrying a zero-percent coupon for the first time,
Bundesbank data showed today. The securities were sold to yield
0.07 percent. The country offered a fixed interest payment of
0.25 percent when selling similar-maturity notes on April 18.  Record Yields  German 10-year bond yields dropped to a record low 1.395
percent.  U.K. government yields on two-, five- and 10-year notes
declined to record lows, after  Bank of England  minutes showed
the decision to pause stimulus was a “finely balanced” one for
some policy makers. The yield on 10-year gilts dropped as much
as nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to a record
1.779 percent. The yield on the nation’s two-year notes fell to
an all-time low of 0.248 percent and five-year rates slid to
0.752 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  declined 1.6 percent, and the
euro dropped as low as $1.2615, the weakest since August 2010.
Yields on German five- and 30-year bunds fell to records amid
deepening concern  Greece  will exit the euro.  “Everybody is in a wait-and-see mode to see what happens
with the euro,” Franzese of Wunderlich said.  The Fed purchased Treasuries due from August 2022 to May
2030 in its first operation today, according to the Fed Bank of
 New York ’s  website . The central bank also plans to purchase as
much as $5 billion of securities maturing from May 2018 to May
2020 in its second operation scheduled for 2 p.m. as part of a
program to replace $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its
holdings with longer maturities to support the economy by
keeping down borrowing costs.  Demand for new U.S. homes increased more than forecast in
April as low prices and mortgage interest rates drew buyers.
Purchases rose to a 343,000 annual rate, up 3.3 percent from a
revised 332,000 in March, the Commerce Department reported today
in  Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists was 335,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
