Turkey  is planning to make donations
for the construction of religious buildings tax-deductible as
part of a package of investment incentives.  The measure, included in a draft law submitted to
parliament in Ankara today, covers all places of worship built
with official permission as well as religious education
facilities such as Koran schools. Donors will be able to deduct
contributions of as much as 10 percent of taxable income.  Turkey, with a population of about 75 million, has 82,000
mosques and another 35,000 at the planning stage, according to
the Presidency of Religious Affairs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
