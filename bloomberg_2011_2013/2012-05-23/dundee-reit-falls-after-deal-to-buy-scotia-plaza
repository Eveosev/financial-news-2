Dundee Real Estate Investment Trust (D-U) 
fell after saying it would issue shares to help fund the
purchase of two-thirds of Scotia Plaza in Canada’s most
expensive office sale.  Dundee units fell 53 cents, or 1.5 percent, to C$36.07 at
11:03 a.m. in Toronto and earlier fell to C$35.90, its lowest
level since April 5.  Dundee and H&R Real Estate Investment Trust agreed late
yesterday to buy Scotia Plaza, Canada’s second-tallest office
building, from  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  for a record C$1.27 billion
($1.24 billion).  Toronto-based Dundee agreed to sell as many as 9 million
units of its trust at a price of C$35.90 each to help finance
the sale.  The transaction will be the biggest office sale in  Canada ,
according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New York-based
property research company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
