Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) ,
 India â€™s biggest power-equipment maker, beat estimates and posted
a 21 percent increase in profit, the highest in any quarter.  Net income rose to 33.8 billion rupees ($602 million), or
13.81 rupees a share, in the three months ended March 31 from 28
billion rupees, or 11.43 rupees, a year earlier, the New Delhi-
based company said in a statement today. The median of 33
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 30.9 billion rupees.
Revenue rose 7.5 percent to 192.6 billion rupees.  Higher earnings will help state-run Bharat Heavy thwart
competition from Chinese rivals, which are expanding overseas as
local demand slows. India plans to add 76 gigawatts of capacity
in five years to help revive economic growth to 9 percent from
6.1 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the slowest pace in
almost three years.  Bharat Heavy  shares  gained 0.6 percent to 209.85 rupees as
of 2:32 p.m. in Mumbai trading. The  stock  has declined 12
percent this year, compared with a 3 percent increase in the
benchmark Sensitive Index.  Orders in hand as of March 31 were valued at 1.35 trillion
rupees compared with 1.64 trillion rupees a year earlier,
according to the provisional earnings statement last month.  The company plans to double revenue in the next five years,
with a target of $20 billion, Chairman B. Prasada Rao said April
3. The company may get new orders for as much as 16,000
megawatts in the current fiscal year and deliver 22,000
megawatts, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
