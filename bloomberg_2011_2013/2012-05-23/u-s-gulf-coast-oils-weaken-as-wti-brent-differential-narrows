U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums
weakened as the gap between West Texas Intermediate and Brent
narrowed for the first time in four days.  Brent crude’s premium over WTI, based on July futures
prices, narrowed 69 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $15.87 a barrel at
12:38 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
When Brent falls versus WTI, it typically weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Mars Blend’s premium narrowed 80 cents to $10 at 12:06
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Poseidon’s
premium fell $1.15 to $8.60, while Southern Green Canyon’s
dropped $1 to $8.75. The three grades are used in the Argus Sour
Crude Index.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur
content than the other three, fell 60 cents against WTI to a
premium of $13.40.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI dropped 60 cents to
$12.80 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium dipped $1 to
$14.25 a barrel.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$16.25 a barrel. Syncrude’s premium was steady at $1.90 and
Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
