Kevin Youkilis  hit a solo home run in
his second at-bat after coming off the 15-day disabled list as
the  Boston Red Sox  lost 4-1 to the  Baltimore Orioles .  Youkilis, 33, who started at first base last night, hit his
third home run of the season in the fourth inning for the Red
Sox at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore. Youkilis was
placed on the disabled list May 2 with a lower back strain.  Steve Tolleson hit a two-run homer in the second inning to
open the scoring for Baltimore last night and Wilson Betemit had
a two-run homer in the eighth for the Orioles.  Brian Matusz (4-4) struck out nine and allowed one run on
two hits in 6 1/3 innings. Jim Johnson got his 16th save with a
perfect ninth inning.  Felix Doubront (4-2) gave up two runs on four hits in six
innings while striking out nine for the  Red Sox .  Boston placed outfielder  Cody Ross  on the disabled list
with a fracture in his left foot and selected outfielder Scott Podsednik from Triple-A Pawtucket. Outfielder Ryan Sweeney was
placed on the seven-day concussion disabled list and pitcher
Daisuke Matsuzaka was transferred to the 60-day disabled list to
make room for Podsednik on the 40-man roster.  Boston (21-22) is last in the five-team American League
East, 6 1/2 games behind the Orioles, who lead the division with
a 28-16 record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
