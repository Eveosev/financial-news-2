Producer-price inflation in  Ghana ,
West Africa’s second-biggest economy, slowed for the first time
in four months in April as prices for gold fell, according to
the Ghana Statistical Service.  The rate  declined  to 15.8 percent from a revised 16.2
percent a month earlier, Baah Wadieh, acting deputy government
statistician at the Ghana Statistical Service, told reporters in
the capital, Accra, today.  “Producer-price inflation in mining and quarrying dropped
7.2 percent because of a decline in  gold prices , which affected
the overall index,” he said.  Mining and quarrying costs, which account for 14 percent of
the index, rose 24.3 percent from 31.5 percent a month earlier,
Wadieh said. In April, spot gold prices were an average of
$1,650.58 an ounce, less than March’s rate of $1,677.55 an
ounce. Gold was Ghana’s biggest source of foreign currency
earnings in the first quarter of 2012, according to the central
bank.  Manufacturing, which accounts for 70 percent of the
measure, rose 16.2 percent from 15.5 percent in the previous
month, he said. Utilities were unchanged at 9.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
