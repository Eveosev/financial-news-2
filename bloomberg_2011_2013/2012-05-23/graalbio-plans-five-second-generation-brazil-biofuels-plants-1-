GraalBio Investimentos SA, the
biofuels unit of closely held Graal Investimentos SA, plans to
build five plants in  Brazil  that produce ethanol from sugar-cane
residues.  The first facility, planned for the state of Alagoas, is
expected to start operating in December 2013, GraalBio said
today in a press release.  Brazilian sugar-cane mills would be able operate at full
capacity, boosting national ethanol production by 35 percent, if
they processed their biomass leftovers into ethanol instead of
burning them or leaving them in fields, Bernardo Gradin,
president of GraalBio, said in the statement.  “We’re offering a clean and economically viable solution
to maximize the productivity and competitiveness of Brazilian
ethanol,” Gradin said.  The 300 million-real ($147.3 million) Alagoas plant is
expected to start operating at the end of 2013 and will have
capacity to produce 82 million liters (21.6 million gallons) of
fuel a year, according to the statement.  Beta Renewables, a unit of Tortona, Italy-based Gruppo
Mossi & Ghisolfi, will provide technology capable of breaking
down tough plant matter into easily fermentable sugars, GraalBio
said in the statement. Chemtex Italia Srl, another unit of
Gruppo Mossi & Ghisolfi, will develop the plant.  Novozymes A/S (NZYMB)  will supply enzymes for the facility, the
Danish biotechnology company said today in a statement.  Mills may operate at 80 percent of capacity this year after
cutting investments in new plantations, Antonio de Padua Rodrigues, technical director for the sugar-cane trade group
Unica, said March 9 in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
