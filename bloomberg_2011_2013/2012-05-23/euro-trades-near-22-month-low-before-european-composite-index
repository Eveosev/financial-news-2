The euro touched the weakest level
against the dollar since July 2010 as German manufacturing data
weakened and  China  said its biggest banks may fall short of loan
targets.  Europe ’s 17-nation currency has fallen more than 5 percent
against the dollar and yen this month as a Greek opinion poll
showed the anti-bailout party was gaining support for the June
17 election. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  touched a 20-month high after
three officials said loan demand from China’s biggest banks is
drying up.  New Zealand ’s dollar rose against all 16 of its major
counterparts as Moody’s Investors Service reaffirmed its AAA
rating.  “It’s unwelcome development with German manufacturing,
because typically that’s where you go looking for a silver
lining in the euro,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic
strategist at  Miller Tabak  in New York. “The second quarter had
delivered a shock to growth expectations globally.”  The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2532 at 5 p.m. New York
time after touching $1.2516, the weakest since July 6, 2010. The
shared currency declined 0.2 percent to 99.76 yen, after
tumbling 1.4 percent yesterday. The dollar rose 0.2 percent to
79.60 yen.  A German index based on a survey of  purchasing managers  in
the manufacturing industry declined to 45 this month from 46.2
in April, Markit Economics said today.  Greece ’s Syriza party had 30 percent support for the
election, according to a Public Issue poll presented on Athens-
based Skai TV today. The party is opposed to implementing the
nation’s international rescue even as the poll showed 85 percent
of Greeks want to keep the euro.  China’s Banks  China’s loan shortfall would be the first in seven years,
according an exclusive Bloomberg News report. A decline in
lending in April and May means it’s likely the banks’ total new
loans for 2012 will be about 7 trillion  yuan  ($1.1 billion),
less than the government goal of 8 trillion yuan to 8.5 trillion
yuan, said one Chinese bank official who declined to be
identified  Higher-yielding currencies reversed losses after Italian
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said a majority of European Union
leaders at a Brussels summit this week backed the idea of joint
euro-area bonds.  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to 97.63 U.S. cents,
after declining 0.4 percent. The Aussie fell to 96.90 U.S. cents
yesterday, a six-month low.  New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.5 percent to 75.34 U.S. cents
after falling 0.2 percent. The so-called kiwi’s gains were
supported as Moody’s cited the government’s deficit and debt
trajectories in affirming its AAA rating.  Taylor’s View  The Dollar Index rose 0.2 percent to 82.278, after touching
82.364, the strongest since Sept. 2010.  “I don’t think there is any reason to get bullish,”  John Taylor , founder of currency-hedge fund FX Concepts LLC said in a
Bloomberg TV interview on “Inside Track” with Sara Eisen. “We
own a lot of dollars. We own them against the euro and almost
everything. You own them because you don’t like the others.”  The Swiss franc weakened to its lowest level in two months
against the euro amid speculation the central bank may take
action to discourage investment in the nation through taxing
deposits.  SNB spokeswoman Silvia Oppliger declined to comment on the
Swiss franc exchange rate. Finance Ministry spokesman Roland
Meier wouldn’t comment on the tax speculation.  The franc slid as much as 0.6 percent to 1.20766 per euro
and finished little changed at 1.20140 per euro.  The euro fell 4.8 percent in the past six months, making it
the worst performer among 10 developed-nation currencies,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 1.2 percent and the yen fell 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
