(Corrects first paragraph to show economy would contract
2.1 percent.)  Russia’s economy would shrink 2.1
percent in a worst-case scenario, with as much as $95 billion in
capital leaving the country, if  Greece  quits the euro area,
Ksenia Yudaeva, chief economist at OAO Sberbank, said by phone.  Greece’s exit from the 17-nation region would also lead to
 oil prices  dropping to $85 a barrel and inflation accelerating
to 6.7 percent from 3.6 percent in the first quarter, Yudaeva
wrote in an e-mailed report. The outflow may reach $95 billion
in a year, she said by phone from Moscow today.  “If the crisis does not kill the euro area, it will make
it stronger,” Yudaeva wrote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
