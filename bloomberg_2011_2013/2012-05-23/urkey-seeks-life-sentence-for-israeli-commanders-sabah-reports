A Turkish prosecutor will seek  life
imprisonment  for four Israeli commanders in connection with the
2010 interception of a Gaza-bound ship during which nine Turks
were killed, Sabah said.  Gabi Ashkenazi, Israel’s military chief of staff during the
May 31, 2010, raid on the Mavi Marmara ship from  Turkey  that
sought to breach the Gaza Strip blockade, and three others will
be tried as fugitive defendants, the newspaper  reported , citing
Istanbul prosecutor Mehmet Akif Ekinci’s indictment.  The 144-page document charges that Israeli officials
deliberately killed, wounded and tortured the pro-Palestinian
activists who sought to end the embargo, according to Sabah. The
prosecution will file the indictment after final approval from a
chief attorney, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
