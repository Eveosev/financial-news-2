Nationwide Building Society , U.K.’s
largest customer-owned lender, said full-year pretax profit fell
36 percent on charges related to the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme and the government’s bank levy.  Pretax profit fell to 203 million pounds ($320 million)
in the 12 months to April 4 from 317 million pounds in the year
earlier period, the Swindon, England-based company said in a
statement today. Profit was hurt by a 75 million-pound charge
for the FSCS, the industry’s compensation fund, and the bank
balance-sheet tax. It also set aside 103 million pounds to
compensate clients improperly sold personal-loan insurance.  “Our financial position remains strong and robust,” Chief
Executive Officer Graham Beale said in the statement. “Our
underlying profit is up 10 percent and our balance sheet
continues to be characterized by high quality assets, high
levels of liquidity, a strong and diversified funding platform
and peer group leading  capital ratios .”  Nationwide said the housing and savings markets will be
“flat” until the U.K. economy recovers. Britain fell into its
first double-dip recession since the 1970s in the first quarter
as government spending cuts, rising unemployment and higher-
than-targeted inflation curtailed economic activity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
