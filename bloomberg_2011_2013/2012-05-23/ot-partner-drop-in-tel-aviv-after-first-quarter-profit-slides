Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT)  and
Partner Communications Co. tumbled to the lowest in at least
three years in Tel Aviv after the Israeli telecommunications
providers reported a slump in first-quarter profit.  Shares of Hot, the country’s second-largest fixed-line
operator, lost 6.5 percent to 29.6 shekels, the lowest since
April 2009, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. Partner dropped
4.8 percent to 18.10 shekels, the lowest since June 2003.  Hot, which also provides cable television services, said
net income fell to 59 million shekels ($15 million) from 80
million shekels a year earlier. Partner, Israel’s second-largest
mobile-phone company, reported a 43 percent slide in profit as
competition intensified.  Scailex Corp. (SCIX) , which owns a 44.54 percent stake in Partner
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, dropped 19 percent to
6.85 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
