U.K. government bonds rose, pushing
two-, five- and 10-year yields to record lows, after  Bank of
England  minutes showed the decision to pause stimulus was a
“finely balanced” one for some policy makers.  The pound fell to its lowest in more than two months after
April retail sales dropped the most in more than two years. The
Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 at its May meeting to keep
the target of its bond-purchase, or quantitative easing, program
at 325 billion pounds ($511 billion), the minutes released today
showed. The  International Monetary Fund  said yesterday the
central bank needs to inject more stimulus into the U.K.
economy.  “The message of the MPC minutes for gilts is that there’s
a credible threat of more QE if needed, keeping the market
underpinned for now,” said  Sam Hill , a gilt strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada in  London . “The market takes seriously the IMF’s
comments yesterday, with increased expectations of more QE
supportive at the margin.”  The yield on  10-year gilts  dropped as much as twelve basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to a record 1.757 percent, and
was at 1.78 percent at 4:10 p.m. London time. The 4 percent
security due March 2022, rose 0.96, or 9.60 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 119.92. The yield on the nation’s two-year
notes fell to an all-time low 0.242 percent and five-year rates
slid to 0.735 percent.  ‘Finely Balanced’  “For several members, the decision not to expand the
asset-purchase program at this meeting was finely balanced,”
according to the MPC minutes. “The committee would continue to
monitor the outlook each month and further monetary stimulus
could be added if the outlook warranted it.”  Retail sales, including those of auto fuel, declined 2.3
percent from March, when they rose a revised 2 percent, the
 Office for National Statistics  said today in London. That was
the biggest decline since January 2010. The median forecast of
24 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.8 percent drop.  U.K. 10-year government bonds also advanced after  Greece ’s
former Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  told the Wall Street
Journal yesterday there’s a risk, albeit unlikely, that the
nation will leave the euro.  U.K. debt has returned 2.2 percent this month, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies, as investors sought a refuge from
the euro region’s sovereign-debt crisis. German bunds gained 1.4
percent while Spanish securities dropped 1.8 percent.  IMF Comment  The IMF said yesterday the Bank of England should act to
boost the U.K. economy through more bond purchases or by cutting
 interest rates  as “large” risks from the euro-area crisis may
derail growth and inflationary pressures remain weak.  The pound slipped 0.3 percent to $1.5712 after touching
$1.5680, the weakest since March 15. Sterling was 0.5 percent
stronger at 80.13 pence per euro.  The British currency has appreciated 5.5 percent in the
past three months, the third-best performer of the 10 developed-
nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The yen advanced 6.8 percent, while the dollar gained
5.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
