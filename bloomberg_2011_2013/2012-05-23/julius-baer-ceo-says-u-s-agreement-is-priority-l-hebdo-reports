Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  Chief
Executive Officer Boris Collardi said the bank’s “priority” is
to reach a settlement on tax matters with the  U.S. Department of
Justice , L’Hebdo reported.  That agreement may come in the second half of the year and
Julius Baer has the resources to meet its cost obligations,
Collardi said in an interview to be published in tomorrow’s
issue of the magazine.  While Switzerland is ready to hand over client details to
the U.S., that would have to be part of a comprehensive
solution, which Collardi hopes will come before the end of the
year, according to L’Hebdo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
