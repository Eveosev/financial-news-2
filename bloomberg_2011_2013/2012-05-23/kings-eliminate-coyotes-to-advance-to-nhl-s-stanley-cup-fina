Dustin Penner scored with less than
three minutes to play in overtime to send the  Los Angeles Kings 
into the National Hockey League’s Stanley Cup Finals.  The Kings won 4-3 to eliminate the Phoenix Coyotes by
taking the best-of-seven Western Conference final by four games
to one. Los Angeles will meet the  New York Rangers  or New Jersey
Devils in the championship round.  Penner scored with an 18-foot wristshot 17 minutes, 42
seconds into overtime for the Kings, who advanced to the title
round for the first time since 1993, when Wayne Gretzky was part
of the Los Angeles team that lost in its only finals appearance
to the  Montreal Canadiens .  “I got a lucky bounce,” Penner told reporters after the
Kings won an NHL-record eighth straight game on the road. “I
just waited for it to settle down and I got a chance to get it
in the net.”  Taylor Pyatt gave the Coyotes a 1-0 lead in the first
period and Anze Kopitar tied it with a 21-foot short-handed tip-in 
at Jobing.com Arena in Glendale,  Arizona .  Marc-Antoine Pouliot restored the Coyotes’ lead in the
second period before Drew Doughty and Mike Richards scored back-
to-back goals 2 1/2 minutes apart to give the Kings a 3-2 lead.
Keith Yandle ended the period with an 11-foot wristshot to tie
the game at 3-3.  Tonight, the Eastern Conference final resumes at Madison
Square Garden in  New York  with the Rangers and Devils tied at
two games apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
