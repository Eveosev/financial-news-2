Hemofarm AD , a Serbian drug maker
whose unpaid bills led to a writedown at owner, German  Stada
Arzneimittel AG (SAZ) , said it started direct sales to state-run
pharmacies, circumventing some wholesalers.  The new policy will “reduce complexity of the supply
chain” the company said in an e-mailed statement. Hemofarm
previously incurred losses after some Serbian pharmaceutical
wholesalers failed to pay for the drugs produced by the Vrsac,
Serbia-based company.  Stada had a 96.9 million-euro ($123 million) writedown in
November before taxes because of its Serbian business. About a
half of the writedown was related to deliveries to  Serbia ’s
dominant state-run health care  system . Its 2011 profit slipped
68 percent because of the one-time charges.  A Serbian unit of Mannheim-based Phoenix Pharmahandel GmbH
will provide logistic support in distributing Hemofarm products,
Hemofarm said, adding that it may continue to cooperate with
some wholesalers in the region.  Stada bought Hemofarm in 2006 for 480 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
