Viacom Inc. (VIAB) , the media company that
owns Paramount film studio, MTV, Nickelodeon and  Comedy Central ,
raised its quarterly dividend 10 percent to 27.5 cents a share,
less than some analysts had estimated.  The next dividend is payable on July 2 to shareholders of
record June 15, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. Bloomberg analysts had estimated 30 cents. This is
the second time the company has increased the dividend in the
past two years, according to Viacom.  “Returning value to our shareholders is a priority for
Viacom,” Chief Executive Officer  Philippe Dauman  said in the
statement.  Viacom, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , on May 3
reported a 56 percent increase in profit to $585 million, or
$1.07 a share, for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31, on
higher fees paid by cable and satellite operators to carry its
networks. Cable networks drove a 15 percent increase in fees,
while U.S. advertising sales rose 1 percent. Viacom has
underperformed peers in advertising, according to Bloomberg
Industries.  The company recently resolved a legal dispute with Time
Warner Cable Inc., allowing the cable company to view Viacom’s
television programming on digital devices such as Apple Inc.’s
iPad. Viacom also announced a deal with Amazon Inc. that allows
the retailer to stream Paramount films to Amazon Prime
subscribers.  Viacom rose less than 1 percent to $47.21 in  New York  at
the close. The shares have gained 4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
