President  Dennis Lockhart  rebutted critics of the central bank
who say its policies are monetizing the national debt or
encouraging more deficit spending.  “I object to the view that the Fed is monetizing the
debt,”  Lockhart said as part of a panel discussion at the
University of Iowa in Iowa City.  Fed officials led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  have said
repeatedly they would not try to monetize debts by increasing
money and stimulating inflation. Bernanke has urged Congress and
President Barack Obama to put fiscal policy on a sustainable
path.  The “coincidence” of accommodative monetary policy and
increases in the government’s debt “doesn’t mean they are
connected,” Lockhart said at a  University of Iowa  School of Law
conference on the national debt.  Fed policy makers have “pursued very accommodative
monetary policy,” Lockhart said, and “I have been supportive
of accommodative policies and I continue to do so.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
