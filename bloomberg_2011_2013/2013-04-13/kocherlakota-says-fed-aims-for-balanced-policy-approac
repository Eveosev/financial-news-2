Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis
President Narayana Kocherlakota said the central bank takes a
balanced approach in addressing its dual mandate to ensure  price
stability  and maximize employment.  Kocherlakota, speaking today in a panel discussion at the
Boston Fed, reiterated a January 2012 policy statement in which
the Federal Open Market Committee said its inflation and
employment “objectives are generally complementary.”  “However, under circumstances in which the committee
judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a
balanced approach in promoting them,” Kocherlakota said,
according to slides he prepared for the panel, quoting from the
FOMC statement of principles.  The FOMC in March reiterated its plan to buy $85 billion in
bonds every month until the labor market outlook improves
“substantially.” It also pledged to keep  interest rates  near
zero as long as unemployment is above 6.5 percent and inflation
doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
