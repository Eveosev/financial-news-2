Carmelo Anthony  and J.R. Smith each
scored 31 points in the  New York  Knicks’ 101-91 victory against
the  Cleveland Cavaliers  in a National Basketball Association
contest.  The Knicks (52-27) are second in the Eastern Conference, 11
games behind the league-leading and top-seeded Miami Heat
(63-16). New York is three games ahead of Indiana (49-30) and
five better than the Brooklyn Nets (47-32), who defeated the
Pacers 117-109 last night, in the race for the second seed.  Anthony also had 14 rebounds for the Knicks last night at
Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. Kyrie Irving scored 31 points
for the Cavaliers and Tristan Thompson added 15 points.  Forward Solomon Jones, 28, who was signed by the Knicks
yesterday after spending the 2012-13 season with Liaoning of the
Chinese Basketball Association, played 12 minutes. Jones
replaced 40-year-old forward Kurt Thomas, who was waived after
missing the last 12 games with a stress fracture in his foot and
wasn’t going to return this season.  Oklahoma City’s  Kevin Durant  was fined $25,000 for making a
“menacing gesture” when he pretended to slash his throat in a
116-97 win at the  Golden State Warriors  on April 11, the NBA
said yesterday.  Durant dunked the ball late in the second quarter and then
made the throat-slicing move followed by crossed hands in
prayer.  “Kill ’em and pray for ’em after the game,” said Durant,
who was explaining the moves to reporters. “It’s nothing
against the team I’m playing against.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
