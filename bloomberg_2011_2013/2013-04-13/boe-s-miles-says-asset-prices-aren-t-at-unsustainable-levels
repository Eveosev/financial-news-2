Bank of England policy maker  David Miles  said he doesn’t see evidence of asset price bubbles in the
U.K., countering criticism that the country’s central bank is
fueling excessive risk-taking.  “I don’t think we’re in that kind of territory that
obviously makes these asset prices unsustainable and at a bubble
level,” Miles said today during a panel discussion at the
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, citing stock prices and
corporate bond yields. “They’ve been very depressed and they’re
more moving back to normal levels.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
