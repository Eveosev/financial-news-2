The Financial Conduct Authority and
its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, have rejected
just 30 out of 227,000 applicants to take on some of the most
risky jobs in British banks since the financial crisis, the
Guardian reports.
*The FCA said it had blocked about one in every 7,566 people who
had applied to become ’approved persons’ in the last six years:

*The so-called ’fit and proper’ test is designed to assess
bankers’ “honesty, integrity and reputation” as well as
“competence and capability,” the Guardian said, citing the FCA.
*A spokesman for the FCA declined to comment on exactly how the regulator
decides if a person is fit and proper although it involves criminal record
checks, the Guardian reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
