San Diego  Padres outfielder Carlos Quentin was suspended for eight games after he charged the mound
and incited a bench-clearing brawl that left  Los Angeles  Dodgers
pitcher Zack Greinke with a broken collarbone,  Major League
Baseball  said.  Dodgers infielder Jerry Hairston Jr. was suspended one game
for starting a second confrontation when he gestured at someone
in the Padres’ dugout during Los Angeles’ 3-2 win on April 11 at
Petco Park in San Diego.  Quentin and Hairston, who each also face undisclosed fines,
appealed their suspensions, said Joe Garagiola Jr., senior vice
president of Standard and On-Field Operations for the league.
They are eligible to play until their appeals have been
completed.  The right-handed Greinke hit Quentin’s left shoulder with a
pitch in the bottom of the sixth inning, which prompted the
batter to start walking toward the mound. When Greinke appeared
to say something to him, Quentin charged the pitcher.  The two collided shoulder-to-shoulder before Quentin
tackled Greinke and broke his left collarbone. Both then ended
up at the bottom of a pile of players as teams ran onto the
field.  It was the third time in his career that Quentin has been
hit by Greinke, most recently in 2009, according to ESPN.
Quentin has led the major leagues in being hit by pitches the
past two seasons, with 116 in his eight-year career.  Quentin, Greinke, Hairston and  Matt Kemp  of the Dodgers
were ejected from the game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
