President  Charles Evans  said policy makers shouldn’t “obsess”
over the possibility of future price increases, citing the
Fed’s success in recent years in curbing inflation.  Policy makers must consider the central bank’s 2 percent
price goal as “a target, not a ceiling,” Evans said today
during a panel discussion at the Boston Fed. A hard limit may
mean inflation will average below 2 percent, imposing burdens on
borrowers, he said.  Evans reiterated that he’s worried the U.S. will become
more like Japan, which has struggled with deflation for more
than a decade.  The Fed, aiming to stoke growth and bring down
unemployment, affirmed last month its plan to keep buying $85
billion in bonds per month and reiterated its pledge to keep
 interest rates  low.  The central bank is pursuing an appropriate policy to
ensure the U.S. advances toward full employment, which will be a
“slow” process, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
