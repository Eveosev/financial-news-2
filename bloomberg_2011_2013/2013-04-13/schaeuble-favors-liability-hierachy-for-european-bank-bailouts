German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he wants to see a “liability hierarchy” where
owners and creditors of banks are first in line to bail them out
before governments bolster equity and the European Stability
Mechanism provides international aid.  “It is not so that all banks can in future cover their
capital requirements at the ESM,” Schaeuble told reporters in
Dublin after a two-day meeting of European Union finance
ministers and central bank governors. “Before the state gets
involved in the liability hierarchy, owners and creditors of
banks” will be asked to contribute, and the ESM will help if
“the government itself can’t because its access to financial
markets is restricted,” he said.  Independently of the fact that Cyprus was a “unique case,
we will no longer accept the moral hazard problem,” Schaeuble
said. “In the future, it will have to be possible to wind down
troubled banks just like any other company, without risking the
stability of the financial sector as a whole.”  To the extent necessary, a troubled bank’s home state has
to ensure the provisioning of capital, Schaeuble said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
