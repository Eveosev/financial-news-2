The  New York Yankees  beat the
Baltimore Orioles 5-2 last night, turning an unusual triple play
and scoring the winning runs on a dropped fly ball.  The triple play at Yankee Stadium featured six throws
around the infield involving four players. It was New York’s
first triple play in three years and its first at home since
1968, according to Major League Baseball’s website.  After Baltimore put the first two men on base in the top
of the eighth inning, Yankees second baseman  Robinson Cano 
caught Manny Machado’s line drive on a short hop and flipped the
ball to shortstop Jayson Nix to force out Nick Markakis. Nix
spun and threw the ball to third baseman  Kevin Youkilis  to catch
Alexi Casilla, who froze between second and third bases, in a
rundown.  Youkils exchanged throws with Nix before tagging Casilla
for the second out. Machado rounded first base during the
rundown and Youkilis then threw to first baseman Lyle Overbay,
setting off another rundown in which the Oriole was tagged by
Cano for the third out.  New York went in front in the bottom of the seventh inning
as  Adam Jones , Baltimore’s Gold Glove-winning center fielder,
dropped a Vernon Wells’s fly ball with two outs and the bases
loaded, allowing all three runs to score for a 5-2 Yankees lead.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
