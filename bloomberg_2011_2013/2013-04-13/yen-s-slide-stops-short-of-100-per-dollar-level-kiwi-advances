The yen stopped just short of 100
to the dollar, a level it hasn’t reached in four years, as it
slid after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  announced unprecedented stimulus
measures on April 4 to end 15 years of deflation.  The Japanese currency gained yesterday, paring a second
weekly loss, after a technical indicator signaled it had dropped
too much, too quickly. The Dollar Index fell for a second week
as lower-than-forecast retail sales added to bets the  Federal
Reserve  will maintain stimulus that debases the currency. Data
next week may show U.S. inflation slowed. The Australian and New
Zealand dollars rose as investors sought higher-yielding assets.  “The real tension is on the yen,”  Alan Ruskin , global
head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy in New York at
Deutsche Bank AG, said in a telephone interview. “The Aussies
and kiwis of this world did quite well.”  The yen weakened 0.8 percent to 98.37 to the dollar this
week in New York and reached 99.95 on April 11, the highest
since April 2009. It sank 1.8 percent to 129.02 per euro and
touched 131.12, the least since January 2010. The 17-nation
currency rallied 0.9 percent to $1.3113 in a second weekly gain.  New Zealand’s currency, called the kiwi, was the biggest
winner against the  U.S. dollar , gaining 1.9 percent to 85.89
U.S. cents. The yen was the biggest loser.  The Aussie dollar and South Africa’s rand were also among
the top performers against the greenback. The  rand  climbed 1.7
percent, the most this year, to 8.9434 to the greenback.
 Australia ’s dollar rose 1.2 percent to $1.0508.  ‘Hot Export’  Australia’s currency will be strong in the near-term on
demand from Japanese investors, said  Hans-Guenter Redeker , the
head of global foreign-exchange strategy at Morgan Stanley in
 London . The benchmark  interest rate  in Australia is 3 percent,
compared with  Japan ’s 0.1 percent.  “The government-bond market of Australia has become a
very, very hot export item,” Redeker said in a radio interview
on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and  Michael McKee .
“That is keeping the currency strong for now.”  The yen’s 14-day relative-strength index versus the
greenback was 28.3 on April 11, its fourth straight day below
the level of 30 that some traders see as a sign an asset has
fallen too quickly. It was 36.7 yesterday.  The currency will probably weaken to 101.25 to the dollar
if it breaches the 100 level, IG Markets Securities Ltd. in
 Tokyo  said, citing trading patterns.  “We struggled to break 100 for a couple of sessions now,”
 Mike Moran , a senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered
Plc in New York, said yesterday. “Yen remains the marquee macro
theme, and will be for the next couple of months.”  BOJ Purchases  Bank of Japan officials said April 4 the central bank will
increase its monthly bond purchases to 7.5 trillion yen ($77
billion), exceeding the 5.2 trillion yen forecast in a Bloomberg
survey. They set a two-year horizon for their goal of 2 percent
inflation.  Yields on 10-year Japanese government  bonds  climbed eight
basis points this week, or 0.08 percentage point, to 0.61
percent, the biggest jump since November 2010.  Confirmation of Japanese investors moving into foreign
fixed-income securities hasn’t yet materialized. They sold a net
1.14 trillion yen in foreign bonds and notes in the week ended
April 5, according to April 11 Ministry of Finance data.  “That is a concern,” Jerry Urwin, director of spot
foreign-exchange in  New York  at Barclays Plc, said in a
telephone interview of Japanese investment flows. “There are
still some very strong forces at work, but I would like to see
that confirmation.”  Yen Forecast  Barclays forecasts the yen will weaken to 103 to the dollar
in a month.  The Japanese currency dropped 3.8 percent in the past
month, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which tracks 10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 1.2
percent, and the euro lost 0.5 percent.  Futures traders decreased their bets to the lowest level in
five weeks that the yen will decline against the dollar, figures
from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission
show. The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a drop in the yen compared with those
on a gain -- so-called  net shorts  -- was 77,697 on April 9,
compared with net shorts of 78,171 a week earlier.  Bets that  sterling  will decline against the dollar rose to
the most since June 2010 as net-short contracts increased to
69,969 from 65,020, the CFTC data show. The pound ended the week
little changed at $1.5343 after touching $1.5412 on April 11,
the highest in seven weeks.  Not Manipulator  The  U.S. Treasury  said in a report yesterday it will press
Japan to refrain from competitive devaluation and from targeting
its  exchange rate  for competitive purposes. The department
declined to name  China  a currency manipulator while saying the
 yuan  “remains significantly undervalued.” China’s yuan rose 0.1
percent to 6.1921 to the greenback, the strongest level since
1993 on a closing basis.  Kuroda reiterated yesterday that the BOJ’s policies are not
aimed at foreign-exchange rates.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners, declined 0.2 percent to 82.311 this week and
touched 82.046, the lowest since March 7.  U.S. retail sales dropped 0.4 percent in March, the biggest
decline since June, Commerce Department figures showed
yesterday. A Bloomberg survey forecast an unchanged reading.  The Fed is purchasing $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage
debt a month in the third round of the quantitative-easing
strategy to spur economic growth.  The U.S. consumer-price index increased 1.6 percent in
March from a year earlier, economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast before the government reports the data on April 16. The
year-over-year increase in February was 2 percent.  The Fed has said one of its thresholds for keeping its key
 interest rate  at virtually zero is inflation projected at no
more than 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
