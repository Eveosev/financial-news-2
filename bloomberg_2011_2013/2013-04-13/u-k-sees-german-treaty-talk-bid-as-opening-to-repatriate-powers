The U.K. views  Germany ’s bid to
alter European Union treaty rules on bank oversight as an
opportunity to pursue its own goal of repatriating powers from
the bloc.  British Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  told EU
counterparts in Dublin yesterday that if one government proposes
revisions to the bloc’s treaties, other nations will want to use
the opportunity to insert changes, according to a U.K. official.  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble yesterday
secured a written commitment from ministers that they would
“work constructively” on proposals to amend treaty rules that
underpin planned oversight powers for the  European Central Bank .
The decision was welcomed by the U.K., as it shows that treaty
changes are firmly on the EU’s agenda, said the official who
didn’t want be named because the talks were private.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  is seeking to win support from
other EU leaders for talks to renegotiate Britain’s status
within the 27-member bloc. Cameron this week took his case for a
more flexible EU to  Spain , France, and Germany, following his
January announcement that, if re-elected in 2015, he’ll called a
referendum on British membership of the EU by the end of 2017.  Cameron has earned rebukes from across Europe and within
his own coalition for the plebiscite plan, which opponents say
adds to uncertainty at a time of economic crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
