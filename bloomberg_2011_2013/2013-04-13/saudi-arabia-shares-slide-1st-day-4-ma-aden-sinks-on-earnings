Saudi Arabia ’s benchmark stock

banks led declines.  Saudi Arabian Mining Co. (MAADEN) , also known as Ma’aden, tumbled

first trading day after announcing April 10 a 3 percent slump in

STC and Mobily.”, Mohammed Al-Omran, a Riyadh-based financial
analyst and president of the Gulf Center for Financial
