Kobe Bryant  ruptured his Achilles
tendon last night, ruling him out for six to nine months, the
 Los Angeles Lakers  said.  “It’s gone,” Lakers trainer Gary Vitti said on the
National Basketball Association team’s Twitter feed. “It has to
be sewn back together.”  Bryant went down as he tried to drive past the Golden State
Warriors’ Harrison Barnes with just over three minutes remaining
in the 118-116 win at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.  “I felt like I got kicked,” Bryant, 34, told reporters
after the game. “It’s a move I’ve made a million times and
‘pop.’ Just a freak situation I guess.”  Bryant, who’s helped the Lakers win five NBA titles, is
third in the league in scoring this season with an average of
27.3 points per game. Los Angeles is in the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Western Conference, one game ahead of the
 Utah Jazz .  To contact the reporter on this story:
