A former  Facebook Inc. (FB)  executive
has joined a partnership that said it will match an offer to buy
the Sacramento Kings, the Sacramento Bee reported, citing a
person familiar with the deal.  The group, which added former Facebook Chief Privacy
Officer  Chris Kelly  as a member, is trying to keep the National
Basketball Association team from being purchased by competing
bidders who want to move the Kings to Seattle.  Valiant Capital Management LP founder Chris Hansen and
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer are
members of the group that have an agreement with the Maloof
family, current owners of the Kings, to purchase a majority
interest in the team for $341 million -- including a $30 million
nonrefundable deposit. They have applied to the league for
relocation to Seattle.  The NBA Board of Governors plans to vote next week to
determine the winning bidder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
