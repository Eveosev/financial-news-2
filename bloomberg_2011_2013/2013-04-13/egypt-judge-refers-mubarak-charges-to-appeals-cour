A Cairo judge referred charges
against ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  to an appeals court,
recusing himself minutes after convening the former leader’s
retrial on charges linked to protester’ deaths.  Judge Mostafa Hassan Abdullah’s decision set up for further
delay a trial that has embodied what families of the roughly 850
people killed during the January 2011 uprising see as justice
denied.  To contact the reporters on this story:
