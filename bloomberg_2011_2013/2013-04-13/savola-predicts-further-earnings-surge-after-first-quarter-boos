Savola Group (SAVOLA) , a Saudi Arabian food
producer, said it expects second-quarter profit to climb to 365
million riyals from 341.3 million riyals a year earlier, after
reporting a 22 percent increase in the first quarter.  The Jeddah-based company had stronger revenue growth led by
edible oils and increased its market share in the retail sector,
according to a  statement  to the Saudi stock market today. Savola
shares, up 10.3 percent this year compared with a 6.2 percent
increase for the benchmark Tadawul All Share Index, closed 1.9
percent higher at 44.1 riyals in Riyadh, giving the company a
market value of about 22.1 billion riyals.  “The company recorded financial results that were above
expectations and also forecasts better results in Q2,” Mohammed Al-Omran, president of the Gulf Center for Financial Consultancy
in  Riyadh , said by e-mail. “This would give its share price a
boost, which materialized today.”  Savola’s board recommended a  dividend  of 0.50 riyal a share
for the first quarter, matching the previous quarter, according
to the statement. The payout increased from a 0.30 riyal
dividend in the three quarters before that, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
