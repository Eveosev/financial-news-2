Asian stocks rose, with the
regional benchmark index capping the biggest weekly gain in
seven months, as the yen traded near 100 per dollar and slower-
than-estimated inflation in  China  eased concern about monetary-
policy tightening.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , a mining company that gets 30 percent of
its revenue in China, advanced 3.4 percent in Sydney.  Toyota

Hong Kong after a slump last week on concern an outbreak of bird
flu in China will hurt  travel demand .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 3.5 percent to 138.17

since August 2011.  Japan ’s Topix Index rallied 7.7 percent in
its best week since December 2009, with the Bank of Japan
reiterating a pledge to continue stimulus.  “The economy in China is weaker over the past few months
compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and so if this
economic trend continues there’s a possibility that authorities
might ease up a little bit,” said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based
head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management
Ltd., which manages about $51 billion. About Japan, “one has to
be careful because stocks prices have done so well. It’s
beautiful, but it is factoring in at least one and a half year’s
EPS growth.”  Chinese Inflation  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rallied 6.8 percent this year
amid optimism Japan will deploy more stimulus and that policy
makers in the U.S. and China remain on standby to support growth.
