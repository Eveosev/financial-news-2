Vietnam ’s government said it will
draw on its experiences a decade ago in controlling severe acute
respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, as the country mobilizes to
prevent any cases or spread of H7N9 avian influenza.  The Chinese capital of Beijing yesterday confirmed its
first H7N9 case, as the nationwide tally of infections from the
new bird-flu strain climbed to at least 49, with at least 11
fatalities.  Vietnam was the first nation in 2003 to successfully
contain its outbreak of SARS, according to the World Health
Organization. Vietnam reported 63 cases, five of which resulted
in fatalities. Worldwide, there were 8,096 probable cases of
SARS, with 774 fatalities,  according  to the WHO.  To prepare for H7N9, Vietnam’s Health Ministry is training
health workers and establishing a network of hospitals that
would treat any patients, while the Agriculture Ministry carries
out sampling in markets and from birds, the government  said  on
its website.  Airports in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi are scanning the
body temperatures of visitors as they arrive, Tuoi Tre newspaper
 reported .  --Jason Folkmanis in Ho Chi Minh City. Editors: Sylvia Wier,
