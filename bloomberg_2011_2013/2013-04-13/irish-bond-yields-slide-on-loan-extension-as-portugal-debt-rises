Ireland’s 10-year  government bonds 
rallied for a second week, pushing the yield to the lowest since
December 2006, after euro-region finance ministers agreed a
seven-year extension on the the nation’s bailout loans.  Portuguese  two-year notes  climbed for a ninth week, the
longest run of gains in 12 years, after its international loans
were also lengthened. Italian 10-year bonds rose for a second
week as the nation’s borrowing costs fell at an auction of 7.2
billion euros ($9.4 billion) of securities. Euro-area
governments and the European Financial Stability Facility sold
31.7 billion euros of bonds and notes last week.  Spain  is due to
sell bonds maturing from 2016 to 2023 on April 18.  “The extension is helping to underpin sentiment for Irish
government bonds,” said Owen Callan, an analyst at  Danske Bank
A/S (DANSKE)  in Dublin. “It is a positive signal to the markets. It
sends a strong message that  Europe  is willing to offer
assistance and support program countries.”  Irish  10-year bond yields  dropped 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, in the week to 3.89 percent at 4:55 p.m. in
 London  yesterday. It fell to 3.88 percent on April 11, the
lowest since Dec. 22, 2006. The price of the 3.9 percent
security maturing in March 2023 rose 1.28, or 12.80 per 1,000-
euro face amount, to 100.05.  The rate on  Portuguese two-year notes  dropped six basis
points to 2.91 percent, taking its run of weekly gains to the
longest since January 2001.  Positive Decision  “The ministers of the Eurogroup would like to take a
definite and positive decision on this extension,” Dutch
finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters in Dublin
yesterday after chairing a meeting of euro-region finance
ministers. The maximum average maturities of the loans for
Ireland and  Portugal  will be extended by seven years, he said.  Italian 10-year bond yields fell five basis points to 4.33
percent, while the rate on Spain’s 10-year securities slid six
basis points to 4.69 percent.  Italy sold 4 billion euros of new 2.25 percent 2016 notes
at 2.29 percent two days ago. That compared with 2.48 percent on
similar-maturity debt allotted on March 13. The Rome-based
Treasury also allotted 1.67 billion euros of 2028 bonds and 1.5
billion euros of floating-rate securities maturing in 2017.  Spain plans to sell 3.3 percent notes maturing in 2016, 4.5
percent securities due in 2018 and 5.4 percent 2023 bonds at
auctions on April 18.  German investor confidence fell from a three-year high in
April, economists predicted before a report on April 16. An
index of investor and analyst expectations fell to 42 from 48.5
in March, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey before the report from the ZEW Center for
European Economic Research in Mannheim.  Irish government bonds have returned 6.1 percent this year
through April 11, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Portuguese bonds returned 2.1 percent and German securities rose
0.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
