Black Caviar, the world’s top-
ranked thoroughbred sprinter, extended her perfect career record
to 25 victories by winning an unprecedented 15th elite
Australian horse race.  The 6-year-old mare, ridden by Luke Nolen and trained by
Peter Moody, beat Epaulette by about two lengths to win the
1,200-meter T.J. Smith Stakes in front of a sellout trackside
crowd at Sydney’s Randwick Racecourse.  “She’s a special horse,” Nolen said in a televised
interview. “You see what she means to racing, and to be part of
that, it just blows you away. I’m going to be hung if she gets
beat.”  In staying unbeaten,  Black Caviar  moved one ahead of
Kingston Town with 15 Group 1 wins since  Australia  introduced
the Group and Listed race classification system in 1979.  “I’m extremely proud of her owning that record,” Moody
said in a televised interview. “I get to enjoy her every day
and I get great pleasure in other people getting to enjoy her.”  Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. (TAH) , Australia’s largest racecourse
betting company, paid A$1.10 ($1.16) for a winning A$1 bet on
Black Caviar, which also won the T.J. Smith Stakes in 2011.  Her latest victory came four days after her sibling sold
for A$5 million, an Australian record for a 1-year-old untrained
racehorse, at the Inglis Easter Yearling Sale in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
