Six bottles of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 are priced at as much as 13,000 euros ($17,000)
and a case of Chateau Margaux 1990 has a top estimate of 10,000
euros at a Christie’s International Plc wine sale in Amsterdam.  A 12-bottle case of Lafite 1982 sold for 28,750 pounds
($44,100) including hammer price, at Bonhams in  London  this
month. Other lots in the Christie’s sale, scheduled for April
23, from the same Bordeaux producers include a case of Margaux
1982 with a top price of 7,500 euros and 12 bottles of Lafite
1993, estimated to reach as much as 7,000 euros. A case of
Chateau Cheval-Blanc 1982 is priced at as much as 7,500 euros.  Renewed investor appetite for Bordeaux after two price
slumps in the past five years has boosted the London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index by 10 percent since November, when it
touched its lowest level since March 2010. A 0.3 percent gain in
March was its fourth straight increase and followed a February
advance of 2.9 percent.  “We believe we are at the start of a recovery period,”
said William Grey, a manager at the Wine Investment Fund in
London. The fund, which has about $50 million under management,
is focused on top Bordeaux producers and vintages.  Among historic lots in the sale, three bottles of Cheval
Blanc 1949 Saint-Emilion reconditioned and relabeled at the
chateau in 1999 carry a top estimate of 6,000 euros while eight
bottles of Echezeaux 1966 Burgundy are priced to reach as much
as 5,500 euros. A four-bottle lot of Chambertin Domaine Armand
Rousseau Burgundy spanning the years 1987 to 1990 is priced at
as much as 5,200 euros.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
