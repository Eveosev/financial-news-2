A Romanee-Conti 1996 Domaine de la
Romanee Conti assortment case fetched top price of $36,900 at an
Acker Merrall & Condit auction in New York this month as demand
persisted from investors and collectors for vintage Burgundies.  DRC assortment cases from the same year in varying
conditions sold for $36,900 at Acker in  Hong Kong  on Jan. 25 and
for $26,290 at a Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. Chicago sale on March
23. Other leading lots at this month’s Acker sale included a
six-liter imperial of Chateau Petrus 1982 Pomerol at $34,440 and
a case of Cote Rotie 1985 La Mouline Guigal Rhone for $14,145.  The London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has rallied 10
percent since November, when it fell to its lowest level since
March 2010. A 0.3 percent gain in March, following a 2.9 percent
increase in February, was its fourth straight advance. A rebound
in Bordeaux first-growth wines such as Chateau Lafite-Rotschild
has helped boost the index.  “It feels like it’s all returning to a much more normal,
stable market,”  Miles Davis , partner in London-based Wine Asset
Managers LLP, with $20 million under management, said in a phone
interview. “Older stock is going along quite nicely. Prices are
gently rising.”  Among leading Bordeaux wines at the Acker auction, a case
of Lafite 2001 sold for $9,225 while 12 bottles of its 1989
vintage fetched $7,995.  Top Californian wines in the sale included a three-bottle
lot of Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon 1997, which fetched
$10,455, and a case of Harlan Estate Red 2007, selling for
$9,840.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
