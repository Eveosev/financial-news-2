Metallurgical coal prices on the
U.S. spot market were mixed amid slack export demand by  Europe ,
Energy Publishing Inc. said.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal rose $1.25, or
0.4 percent, to $321.25 a ton in the week ended today, according
to the  Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider. High-volatility
coal was unchanged at $270.  “At this point, no mid- and low-vol business is known to
have been transacted either on a spot or a term basis with
customers in the Atlantic Basin, and bid/ask spreads are wide,”
Energy Publishing said.  The data provider says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
