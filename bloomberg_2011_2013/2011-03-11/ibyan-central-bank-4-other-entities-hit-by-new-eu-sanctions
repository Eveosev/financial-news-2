The European Union widened
sanctions against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  to include the
country’s central bank and four other financial institutions as
his forces mount an attack on rebels in eastern  Libya .  The EU froze the funds of the Central Bank of Libya,  Libyan
Investment Authority , Libya Africa Investment Portfolio, Libyan
Foreign Bank and Libyan Housing and Infrastructure Board.  These five entities are “under control of Muammar Qaddafi
and his family” and represent a “potential source of funding
for his regime,” the 27-nation EU said in a  decision  published
today in the Official Journal.  The bloc also added Mustafa Zarti, whom it identified as
vice chief executive of the Libyan Investment Authority and as
an Austrian citizen, to a list of 26 people covered by the
sanctions because they are deemed responsible for the Libyan
government’s attacks on civilians. The decision cites Zarti’s
“closeness of association” with the Qaddafi regime.  Since late February , the EU has imposed an arms embargo on
Libya, frozen the assets of Qaddafi and close associates and
barred them from travelling to  Europe  following his attacks on
domestic opponents and the  United Nations Security Council ’s
backing for sanctions.  Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, one of Muammar Qaddafi’s sons, said
yesterday that Libyan government forces are mounting a full-
scale attack on rebels as defense ministers of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization said they lack the authority to
impose a no-fly zone sought by the opposition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
