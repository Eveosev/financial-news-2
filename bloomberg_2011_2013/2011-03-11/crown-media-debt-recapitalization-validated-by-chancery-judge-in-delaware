An investor in  Crown Media Holdings
Inc. (CRWN) , operator of the Hallmark Channel, lost a legal bid to stop
parent company Hallmark Cards Inc. from recapitalizing the
cable-television unit’s debt.  S. Muoio & Co., a New York securities advisory firm, sued
Hallmark Cards and Crown directors in July 2009, contending that
the planned conversion of about $500 million in debt to
preferred stock and other securities would unfairly dilute its
holdings.  “The Crown board’s process was not flawed,” and since
“default and bankruptcy seemed inevitable” at the time, “the
price of the recapitalization was entirely fair,” Delaware
Chancery Court Judge William B. Chandler III wrote in a 63-page
opinion on March 9 dismissing the case.  In the complaint, Muoio said  Kansas City , Missouri-based
Hallmark Cards had “pervasive and longstanding control” of
Crown and its directors. Crown, based in Studio City,  California , reported $287.2 million in sales last year.  “We are gratified by the decision of the court,” Annie Howell, a Hallmark spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed message.
Salvatore Muoio, a principal of the plaintiff company, declined
to comment.  Crown fell 27 cents, or 10.6 percent, to $2.28 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  The case is S. Muoio & Co. v. Hallmark Cards Inc., CA4729,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
