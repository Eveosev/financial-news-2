Aqua Minerale San Benedetto SpA of  Italy  is the likeliest winner of the bid for Slovenia’s juice
maker Fructal d.d. and may offer about 40 million euros ($55
million),  TV Slovenija   reported  without saying where it obtained
the information.  The majority stake of Fructal is being offered by  Pivovarna
Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d. which is selling assets to repay debt with
deadline for bids expiring on March 18, the Ljubljana-based
public broadcaster said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
