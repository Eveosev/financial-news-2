Carbon-emission credit prices in  New Zealand  rose this week as a decline in the country’s
currency, known as the Kiwi, made domestic contracts more
competitive against credits sold in Europe.  Spot carbon credits traded at NZ$20.30 ($14.93) a metric
ton, compared with NZ$19.60 last week, Auckland-based broker
OMFinancial Ltd. said today in an e-mailed statement. That
compares with 11.84 euros ($16.36) or NZ$22.24 for United
Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits on the ICE Futures
Europe Exchange in  London  yesterday.  The  New Zealand dollar  fell to a five-month low yesterday
after the country’s central bank cut its overnight cash rate by
0.5 percentage point to 2.5 percent to help the economy recover
from the nation’s deadliest earthquake in 80 years in February.
Currency weakness combined with “strong” CER prices has made
New Zealand carbon contracts more attractive, OMFinancial said.  “The bullishness we saw at the end of last week has
continued with the  spot market  busting through NZ$20,” the
statement said. “New Zealand units will consolidate around the
$20 level and trade a range from here between $20 and $21 for
the medium term.”  Trading volume reached 500,000 tons for the second week, up
from about 200,000 tons at the end of February, as credit
holders waiting for higher prices put their contracts on the
market, the statement said. Still, high log prices are deterring
some holders of forestry-backed credits, the broker said.  New Zealand companies that emit  greenhouse gases  have the
option to pay a tax of NZ$25 a ton of emissions or buy local
carbon credits or UN CERs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
