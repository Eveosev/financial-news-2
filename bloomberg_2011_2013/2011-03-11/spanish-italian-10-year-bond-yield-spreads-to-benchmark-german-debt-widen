Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds
opened little changed, widening the additional yield investors
demand to hold the securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  The difference in yield, or spread, between Spanish and
German securities increased for a fourth day, rising five basis
points to 231 basis points, or 2.31 percentage points, as of
7:42 a.m. in  London . The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds was one
basis point lower at 5.50 percent while the German bund yield
dropped six basis points to 3.20 percent.  The Italian-German yield spread widened four basis points
to 176 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
