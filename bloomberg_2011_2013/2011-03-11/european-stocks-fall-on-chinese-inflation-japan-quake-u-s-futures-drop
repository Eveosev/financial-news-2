European stocks dropped for a third
day, erasing their gains for the year, as insurers tumbled after
an 8.9-magnitude earthquake in Japan triggered a 10 meter high
tsunami. U.S. index futures and Asian shares retreated.  Swiss Reinsurance Co. plunged 6.7 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) 
fell 1.5 percent as  Australia  said it’s committed to a profit-
based mining tax. K+S AG lost 6.8 percent after  BASF SE (BAS) 
announced plans to sell its remaining stake in the potash maker,
a holding that’s valued at about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion).  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.8 percent to 275.59
at 8:19 a.m. in  London , bringing this year’s decline to 0.1
percent. The gauge has tumbled 5.3 percent since reaching a 2
1/2-year high on Feb. 17 as crude oil surged amid political
unrest and violence in  Libya .  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures fell 0.3 percent before
a report that may show U.S. retail sales climbed in February by
the most in four months. Other data may show business
inventories rose and consumer sentiment declined.  The benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.5 percent
after earthquake struck off the coast of northern Japan, shaking
buildings violently in Tokyo. The earthquake triggered a tsunami
that inundated towns north of the capital.  Chinese Inflation  In  China , inflation and industrial production exceeded
forecasts in February, signaling the central bank’s monetary
tightening has been insufficient so far to contain prices.  Consumer prices rose at an annual 4.9 percent pace in
February and output increased 14 percent in the first two months
of 2011, the statistics bureau said in Beijing. Producer prices
jumped 7.2 percent last month, the most since September 2008.  “Higher than expected inflation readings out of China may
add to the market’s woes although with some key economic data
still be released, this could also offer some fresh direction
going into the weekend break,” said Melbourne-based, Harley Salt, head of sales trading at IG Markets.  Swiss Re, the world’s second-biggest reinsurer, dropped 6.7
percent to 50 Swiss francs.  Munich Re , the world’s largest,
declined 4.6 percent to 111.40 euros. A gauge of insurance
stocks declined 2.2 percent, the biggest drop in more than three
months following the earthquake in Japan.    BHP Billiton , the world’s largest mining company, fell 1.5
percent to 2,265.5 pence in London.  Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  told CNBC that
she’s committed to profit-based mining tax and won’t increase
the mining duty to more than 30 percent.  K+S slid 6.4 percent to 50.75 euros after BASF said it
plans to sell a 10.3 percent stake in the company. Institutional
investors will be sought for as many as 19.7 million shares,
equal to 10.3 percent of  Europe ’s largest potash manufacturer.  BofA Merrill Lynch is placing BASF’s 19.7 million K+S
shares via an accelerated bookbuild.  To contact the reporter on this story:
