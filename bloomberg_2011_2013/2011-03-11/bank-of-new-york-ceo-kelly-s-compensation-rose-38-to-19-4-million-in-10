Robert Kelly, chief executive
officer of  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , the world’s biggest
custody bank, earned $19.4 million last year, a 38 percent
increase from the year before.  Kelly, 56, received more in stock awards and incentive
compensation than he did for 2009, according to a filing
released today. His $1 million base salary remained the same.  New York-based BNY Mellon reported net income of $2.5
billion in 2010, compared with a loss in 2009, as stock and bond
markets rebounded. Kelly has boosted profits by shifting
employment to lower-cost locations and making acquisitions.  Curtis Arledge, hired in August to be head of the bank’s
asset-management unit, received $11.8 million, including stock
awards worth $8.7 million and a bonus of $3 million. Arledge
previously worked at New York-based  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s
largest money manager.  BNY Mellon last year bought BHF Asset Servicing GmbH for
253 million euros ($352 million) to expand in  Europe  and
acquired PNC Financial Service Group Inc.’s investment-servicing
business for $2.31 billion. The bank’s revenue growth has been
hurt by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to keep its main
lending rate near zero since 2008.  BNY Mellon gained 8 percent last year compared with a gain
of 12 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 15-company index of
asset managers and custody banks.  President Gerald Hassell earned $11.2 million, 75 percent
more than he was paid in the previous year. Chief Financial
Officer Thomas Gibbons got $6.8 million, a 67 percent increase.  Custody banks earn fees for keeping records, tracking
performance and lending securities to institutional investors
such as mutual funds, pensions and  hedge funds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
