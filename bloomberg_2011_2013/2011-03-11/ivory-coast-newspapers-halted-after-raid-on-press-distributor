Ivory Coast security forces loyal
to incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo  raided the country’s sole
press distributor to stop the circulation of newspapers that
back his rival, a spokesman for the papers said.  The security forces surrounded the offices of Edipresse at
5 a.m. and demanded that it cease distributing pro-Ouattara
newspapers, said Dembele Al Seni, a spokesman for the alliance
of newspapers that back  Alassane Ouattara . The action prompted
Edipresse and retailers to stop the circulation of all
newspapers in the West African nation, said Modibo Diallo, a
news wholesaler.  “We don’t feel safe when we only have pro-Gbagbo
newspapers to sell,” Diallo said today by phone from Abidjan,
the commercial capital. “We have already been attacked in the
past few weeks by some of Ouattara’s supporters when their
newspapers were banned.”    Ivory Coast , the world’s top cocoa producer, is on the
brink of civil war, with at least 365 people killed since the
disputed presidential election in November, according to the  United Nations . Gbagbo retains the loyalty of the armed forces,
while Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner of the
vote, has set up a rival administration in the Golf hotel in
Abidjan protected by UN peacekeepers.  Eight newspapers that support Ouattara and one independent
paper suspended publication on March 1 to protest against
threats and harassment by Gbagbo’s supporters. The papers
resumed printing on March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
