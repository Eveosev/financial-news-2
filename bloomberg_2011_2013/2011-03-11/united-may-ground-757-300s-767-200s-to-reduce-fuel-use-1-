(Corrects aircraft type to 737-500 in headline.)    United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,
the world’s largest carrier, may ground its  Boeing Co. (BA)  737-500
and 767-200ER aircraft to cut fuel use amid rising prices.  Getting rid of less fuel efficient planes is among steps
the Chicago-based carrier is considering after announcing March
7 that it would pare planned capacity growth this year. The
capacity changes won’t require employee layoffs, Chief Executive
Officer Jeff Smisek said today.  The price of  jet fuel , one of airlines’ largest costs, has
risen 27 percent this year, prompting United to join Delta Air
Lines Inc. and AMR Corp.’s  American Airlines  in cutting 2011
growth plans.  “We can’t just hold our heads in our hands and cry and
scream,” in reaction to higher fuel prices, Smisek said during
a speech at a Houston energy  conference  today. United, with more
than 1,200 aircraft, burns $25,000 in fuel every minute, he
said.  The airline has 34 737-500s with an average age of 15
years, and 10 767-200ERs that are an average 9.8 years old.
United also is looking at other opportunities to reduce fuel use
across its fleet, Smisek said.  United capacity will be unchanged for the full year, down
from a previous forecast of 1 percent to 2 percent growth, the
company said. Domestic capacity will decline by as much as 2.5
percent, while international will increase as much as 3.5
percent, United said.  The biggest U.S. airlines have raised fares six times this
year across their networks. Some carriers, including  JetBlue
Airways Corp. , also have boosted fees for optional goods and
services to help offset the higher fuel costs.  United Continental was formed in October in a $3.47 billion
merger between United Airlines parent UAL Corp. and Houston-
based Continental Airlines. The two airlines will maintain
separate flight operations until the parent company receives a
single operating certificate from federal regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
