President  Barack Obama  said the
U.S. “stands ready” to assist the people of Japan after it was
struck by its strongest earthquake in at least a century,
unleashing a tsunami.  “The United States stands ready to help the Japanese
people in this time of great trial. The friendship and alliance
between our two nations is unshakeable, and only strengthens our
resolve to stand with the people of Japan as they overcome this
tragedy,” Obama said in a written statement released by the
White House today.  Obama said he and the first lady “send our deepest
condolences to the people of Japan, particularly those who have
lost loved ones.”  Obama called Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  at about
10:15 a.m. Washington time to discuss the effects of the quake
and tsunami. The president has instructed the  Federal Emergency
Management Agency  to be ready to assist Hawaii and other U.S.
states and territories that may be affected.  “We are asking all our citizens in the affected region to
listen to their state and local officials,” Obama said.  White House Chief of Staff  William Daley  said later that
the fears of major destruction from the tsunami hitting Hawaii
“seem to have dissipated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
