Multi Commodity Exchange of  India 
Ltd., the nation’s biggest such bourse, expects a 50 percent
jump in turnover in the fiscal year ending this month and may
start freight futures and commodity indexes once the law allows.  “Growth has been accelerating the past few months,” Lamon
Rutten, chief executive officer of the exchange, known as  MCX ,
said in a phone interview from Mumbai today. “There is an
underlying trend.”  Turnover of MCX and rivals in India, the world’s biggest
user of bullion and sugar, jumped 52 percent from April through
February to 106 trillion rupees ($2.3 trillion) because of a
surge in trading gold and metal futures,  data  from the industry
regulator show. A bill that will repel a six-decade-old law that
banned trading in options and indexes in commodities is pending
approval from lawmakers.  “We are ready with a whole slate of contracts,” Rutten
said. “We would look at commodity indices, we would look at
freight futures.”  The bourse, which has more than 80 percent of the nation’s
market for commodity futures, will resubmit documents needed to
gain approval for an initial share sale, Rutten said. An earlier
approval from the markets regulator lapsed as the sale wasn’t
conducted.  “We are not postponing this, sooner rather than later,”
he said, without giving a specific date. “We haven’t made any
secret that we think it’s a very good idea for an exchange.”  ---Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
