  Portugal ’s consumer price index
rose 3.5 percent in February from a year earlier, down from 3.6
percent the prior month, which was the highest since May 2006.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
fell 0.1 percent from January, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said today in an e-mailed statement.  Using the institute’s own methods, consumer prices rose 3.5
percent from a year earlier and were unchanged from January.
Excluding energy and unprocessed food, prices rose 1.9 percent
from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
