Asian stocks fell, dragging the
regional benchmark index to its biggest weekly drop since August,
as a major earthquake hit Japan, violence spread in the Middle
East and U.S. unemployment rose.  Honda Motor Co., the Japanese carmaker that gets about 44
percent of sales in  North America , dropped 2.7 percent in Tokyo,
where losses accelerated after a magnitude 8.9 earthquake shook
buildings in the city’s financial center. Daelim Industrial Co.,
which gets 22 percent of sales from the Middle East, led South
Korean construction companies lower after police broke up a
protest in Saudi Arabia yesterday.  BHP Billiton  Ltd., the
world’s largest mining company, lost 1 percent in Sydney after
copper futures declined.  “The Japan earthquakes added another uncertainty to
markets that were already plagued with turmoil in the Middle
East and European debt concerns,” said Kang Shin Woo, chief
investment officer at Seoul-based Korea Investment Management
Co., which manages $17 billion. “This could raise concern for
the Japanese economy that has showed some signs of recovery.”  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index fell 1.1 percent to 134.59 as
of 8:37 p.m. in Tokyo, the lowest level since Dec. 20. Almost
nine times as many shares declined as advanced on the gauge,
which lost 3.4 percent this week.  The index climbed 1.9 percent last week as better-than-
estimated economic data from South Korea to the U.S. boosted
confidence in a global recovery, overcoming concern that Middle
East unrest will drive  oil prices  higher and slow growth.  Tsunami Strikes  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average decreased 1.7 percent
after the country’s strongest earthquake in at least a century
struck off the northern coast, shaking buildings violently as
far away as Tokyo minutes before  stock trading  ended. The
highest tsunami warning was issued for the northeast coast.  At least 26 people were killed by the 33-foot wave and many
are missing, according to state broadcaster NHK Television,
which showed footage of waves sweeping away buildings and
vehicles as far as 1.5 kilometers inland. Airports were closed
and bullet train services suspended. More than 4 million homes
are without power, Tokyo Electric Power Co. said.    South Korea ’s Kospi Index sank 1.3 percent and  Australia ’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index closed down 1.2 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng
Index slipped 1.6 percent.    China ’s Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.8 percent as
government data showed the nation’s consumer prices rose 4.9
percent in February from a year earlier, exceeding the
government’s 2011 target for a fifth month.  U.S. Unemployment  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent
today. The index tumbled 1.9 percent yesterday in  New York  after
the U.S. Labor Department said applications for first-time  unemployment benefits  rose by 26,000 to 397,000 in the week
ended March 5, more than the median estimate of 376,000 forecast
by economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The U.S. Commerce Department separately said the deficit in
goods and services increased 15 percent in January as a surge in
imports led by costlier crude oil overshadowed record exports.  Honda Motor, which counts North America as its biggest
market, slipped 2.7 percent to 3,310 yen in Tokyo. Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, dropped 1.5 percent to
3,595 yen.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s biggest
supplier, declined 2.9 percent to HK$44.25 in Hong Kong.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has almost doubled in the past
two years. It sank to an eight-year low on March 9, 2009,
following the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
in September 2008.  Debt Concerns  The gauge briefly extended declines yesterday afternoon
after Moody’s Investors Service cut  Spain ’s credit rating,
saying the cost of shoring up the banking industry will eclipse
government estimates.  “The situation in the Middle East provided a trigger for
the market correction and now we’re seeing renewed concerns
about European debt, and there’s ongoing worries about monetary
tightening in Asia,”  Shane Oliver , head of investment strategy
in Sydney at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages about $93
billion, said on Bloomberg Television. “All of these concerns
are combining and making investors somewhat nervous.”  Crude oil for April delivery declined 1.6 percent to settle
at $102.70 a barrel in New York yesterday, after falling as much
as 3.6 percent earlier. Oil pared losses after police in  Saudi
Arabia , the Middle East’s biggest producer of crude, reportedly
opened fire at a rally in the east of the country.  Daelim Industrial slumped 4.7 percent to 101,000 won in  Seoul . Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co., which counts the
Middle East as its biggest market outside of South Korea,
dropped 2 percent to 77,200 won. GS Engineering & Construction
Corp. declined 3.8 percent to 102,000 won.  ‘Chilling Sentiment’  South Korean builders won $47.25 billion of orders from the
Middle East last year, according to the Seoul-based  Korea Trade-
Investment Promotion Agency.   “Some news flow from Saudi are chilling sentiment toward
builders again,” said Lee Jin Woo, a  fund manager  in Seoul at
KTB Asset Management Co., which manages about $10 billion in
assets. “Uncertainties over the situation in the Middle East
may linger for a while.”  Raw material producers fell after the London Metal Exchange
Index of six metals including copper and aluminum slid 0.4
percent yesterday, falling for a second day to the lowest level
since Jan. 26.  BHP Billiton slid 1 percent to A$44.19 in Sydney. Rio Tinto
Group, the world’s second-biggest mining company, declined 2
percent to A$78.80. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer
of the metal, lost 1.7 percent to HK$23.10 in Hong Kong.  Convertible Bonds  IHI Corp., a Japanese heavy-machinery maker, slumped 4.3
percent to 203 yen in Tokyo after saying it plans to sell 23
billion yen ($278 million) of five-year convertible bonds to
overseas investors.    CapitaMall Trust (CT) ,  Singapore ’s biggest retail property trust,
sank 1.1 percent to S$1.81 after the company increased the size
of its convertible bond sale to S$250 million ($197 million)
from S$200 million.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 3 percent by the S&P
500 and 0.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.9 times estimated earnings on
average as of the last close, compared with 13.4 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
