  FirstGroup Plc (FGP)  shares had the
biggest drop in almost a year after the U.K. train operator said
spending cuts have hurt demand at its U.S. school bus division.  Trading at the First Student unit has been “disappointing”
this quarter as school boards face budget pressure, the Aberdeen,
Scotland-based company said in a statement. The stock dropped as
much as 5.6 percent, the most since March 31, 2010.  The yellow-bus business’s poor performance “has been further
exacerbated by the impact of severe weather,” FirstGroup said.
The unit’s margins also have been squeezed by higher labor costs
as schools implement route changes to reduce their own expenses  
the company said.  FirstGroup, best known in Britain for its Great Western
train service from  London  Paddington, became the No. 1 U.S.
school bus operator after buying Laidlaw International Inc. for
$3.6 billion in 2007 to grow a business established with the
$940 million purchase of Ryder Transportation Services in 1999.  FirstGroup was priced 4.4 percent lower at 344.5 pence as
of 9:18 a.m. in London, giving the company a market value of
1.68 billion pounds ($2.7 billion). The shares are down 14
percent so far this year.  The company should still achieve earnings and cash targets
for the 12 months ending March 31, and net debt of 2.5 times
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, it
said in today’s statement. The school-bus unit will continue to
weigh on the next fiscal year’s margins, it said.  Passenger revenue at the U.K. Rail division is projected to
increase 5.1 percent this fiscal year on a comparable basis,
FirstGroup said, with U.K. Bus achieving a 1.4 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
