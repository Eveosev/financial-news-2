In 1664, when comets appeared in
the English sky, many thought the end was near. As apocalyptic
confirmation, then came the bubonic plague.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  It was devastating to  London , ultimately killing one fifth
of its inhabitants. The wealthy tried fleeing to the
countryside, where locals greeted them with muskets and clubs.
The city resonated with the tolling of bells and cries of
“Bring out your dead!”  When the plague reached the  University of Cambridge  in
1665, everyone was sent home, including Isaac Newton, who
retired to his mother’s farm. There, the 23-year-old student
came up with calculus and unlocked the future.  What looked at the time like the end of days turned out to
be the dawn of the modern age.  I spoke with Edward Dolnick, author of “ The Clockwork
Universe : Isaac Newton, the  Royal Society  and the Birth of the
Modern World,” on the following topics:  1. Fear and Trembling  2. The Royal Society  3. Microscopes and Telescopes  4. Isaac Newton  5. Decoding the World  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .    Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
former editor of Harper’s magazine. He hosts “The World in
Time” interview series for Bloomberg News.)  To contact the writer on the story:
