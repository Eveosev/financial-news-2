Russian authorities evacuated about
11,000 people on the Kuril Islands from areas at risk of
flooding after an 8.9-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast
of Japan, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.  Four towns are at risk from a tsunami caused by the
earthquake, the ministry said on its  website  today. Thanks to a
tsunami-warning system on the islands, the situation is “under
control,” the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
