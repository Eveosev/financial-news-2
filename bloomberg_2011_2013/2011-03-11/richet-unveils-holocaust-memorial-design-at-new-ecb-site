European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  unveiled the winning design for a 
Holocaust memorial at the site of its new headquarters in   Frankfurt .   Trichet said officials have been committed since the 
project began to establishing a monument to victims who were 
once deported from  the premises . The memorial will stand in
the Grossmarkthalle, part of the site of the ECB’s new 
building, which is currently under construction.    “The decision-making process involved long and in-depth
discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of the three
very different designs,” Trichet said. “These discussions were
extremely fruitful and I am delighted that they led to a
unanimous decision in favour of a remarkable memorial that will
take full account of the location’s characteristics and reflect
the drama of deportation and the holocaust.”  Trichet’s comments at the ceremony concluded a design
competition for the memorial, which will feature a ramp and a
cellar where thousands of Jews were once imprisoned. Katzkaiser
GbR, an architecture firm based in Cologne,  Germany , won the
jury selection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
