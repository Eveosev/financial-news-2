  China ’s interest-rate swaps were
poised for the biggest weekly drop in two years on speculation
policy makers will pause in raising lenders’ reserve
requirements, helping to ease a cash shortage.  The one-year swap contract tied to the seven-day repurchase
rate declined 29 basis points this week to 3.46 percent as of
12:10 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That is the biggest weekly drop since Nov. 28, 2008. The central
bank yesterday drained cash from the financial system for the
first time in four months, according to data compiled by the
People’s Bank of China.  “The market thinks China will just use open-market
operations to remove liquidity from the system, so doesn’t see a
reserve-requirement hike any time soon,” said  Frances Cheung , a
senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . About 181
billion yuan ($27.5 billion) of debt is due to mature next week,
easing the cash shortage, she said.  The seven-day repo rate, a gauge measuring the availability
of funds, fell 16 basis points for the week and 19 basis points
from yesterday to 2.06 percent, according to a daily fixing
published by the National Interbank Funding Center in Shanghai
at 11 a.m. That’s the biggest daily decline in a week. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point  The central bank drained 10 billion yuan from the financial
system this week, central bank data show.  The People’s Bank lifted lenders’ reserve requirement by 25
basis points to 19.5 percent on Feb. 24 to tame inflation. It
also lifted  interest rates  by 25 basis points on Feb. 9, for the
third time in four months. The benchmark one-year lending rate
is 6.06 percent, and the one-year deposit rate is 3 percent.  China reported today consumer prices rose 4.9 percent in
February from a year earlier, exceeding the government’s target
for a fifth month. The advance was more than the 4.8 percent
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 22 economists. The
government has a 4 percent inflation goal for the full year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
