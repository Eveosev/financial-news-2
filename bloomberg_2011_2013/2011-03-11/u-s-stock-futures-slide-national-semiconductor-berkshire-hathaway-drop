U.S. stocks advanced, trimming the
weekly loss in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as gains in
fuel, metal and industrial companies helped the market overcome
a global slump following  Japan ’s worst earthquake on record.    Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD)  climbed 3.9 percent after forecasting
more profit than analysts estimated.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  surged
6.3 percent as the largest U.S. oil refiner agreed to buy  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s U.K. refinery and 1,000 retail stores.  Pall
Corp. (PLL)  drove industrial stocks higher as the supplier of filters
for drugmakers boosted its earnings forecast. The  iShares MSCI
Japan Index Fund (EWJ) , an exchange-traded fund, fell 1.7 percent.  The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 1,304.28 at 4 p.m. in New
York, paring its weekly decline to 1.3 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  rose 59.79 points, or 0.5 percent, to
12,044.40. Oil slid 1.5 percent as refineries were shut in
Japan, cutting demand in the third-largest oil-consuming nation.  “The good U.S. economic signals are winning over external
shocks,” said  Alan Gayle , senior investment strategist at
RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond,  Virginia , which
oversees $52.5 billion. “Companies are reporting strong
earnings, M&A activity is moving forward, the economy is in
decent shape. We had a recent selloff triggered by all sorts of
external uncertainties. It may be time for investors to look at
the internal strength.”  Middle East Turmoil  The benchmark gauge for American equities had fallen 2
percent over the prior two days as oil surged amid unrest in  Libya  and the Middle East. Energy and raw-materials companies in
the  S&P 500  posted declines of at least 3.6 percent in the
period, the most within 10 industries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. stocks fell earlier today, following a global equity
slump, after Japan’s earthquake. The 8.9-magnitude quake
unleashed a tsunami as high as 10 meters, engulfing towns along
the northern coast and killed hundreds. The temblor hit 130
kilometers off the coast of Sendai, north of  Tokyo , at a depth
of 24 kilometers, the  U.S. Geological Survey  said. A 7.1-
magnitude aftershock followed, it said.  Stock-index futures pared declines before the open of
exchanges as a report showed that U.S. retail sales increased in
February by the most in four months as Americans took advantage
of more seasonable weather to buy cars, clothes and electronics.
Purchases climbed 1 percent after a revised 0.7 percent rise in
January that was more than double the previous estimate,
Commerce Department figures showed. February sales matched the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Pretty Decent’  “The outlook is pretty decent,” said Madelynn Matlock,
who helps oversee $14.5 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati. “The valuation isn’t ridiculous and earnings look
like they will continue to grow. The question would be how much
these risk factors influence the overall valuation on these
earnings. Right now, we think it’s pretty balanced.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 3.7 percent this year, building on
a 13 percent advance in 2010, amid government stimulus measures
and as corporate profits beat estimates for eight straight
quarters. The benchmark gauge is trading at 15.3 times reported
earnings, compared with the average ratio of 19.7 at bull-market
peaks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gauges of raw-materials and energy producers had the two
biggest gains in the S&P 500 within 10 industries, adding at
least 1.3 percent.  Steelmakers Rally  Steel Dynamics rose 3.9 percent to $18.55. The  Fort Wayne ,
Indiana-based producer of the metal forecast first-quarter
earnings may be as high as 42 cents a share, compared with the
38-cent average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.    AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS)  advanced 5.8 percent to $15.46. U.S.
Steel Corp. gained 4.5 percent to $55.14.  Valero advanced 6.3 percent to $27.98. The largest U.S. oil
refiner agreed to buy Chevron Corp.’s U.K. refinery and 1,000
retail outlets for about $1.73 billion in cash, gaining its
first European plant. The Pembroke refinery will add 26 cents a
share to annual profit based on 2010 market prices, Valero said.  Industrial companies had the third-biggest gain in the S&P
500 among 10 industries, rallying 1.2 percent.  Pall gained 6.2 percent to $57.02. The supplier of filters
for drugmakers and refineries increased its full-year forecast,
saying it expects to earn $2.80 a share at least, excluding some
items. Analysts, on average, estimated $2.62, according to a
Bloomberg survey.    Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  climbed 1.7 percent to $100.02. The
world’s largest maker of construction equipment will outperform
the industry over the next 30 days, Morgan Stanley said in a
note, picking the stock as a “research tactical idea.”  ‘Opportunity’  “The recent selloff created an opportunity to buy beaten-up
companies,” said  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage over $25 billion
at Irvington, New York-based Security Global Investors. “There
had been so much fear lately. Obviously, the news out of Japan
is very bad. However, we have a couple of things to support the
market. We’ve got good earnings reports. Oil is down. There’s
not much too say about the Middle East crisis today. Overall,
people do believe the global economy is getting better.”  U.S. shares of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which halted auto
production at its plant in Miyagi, northern Japan, after the
earthquake, dropped 2.1 percent to $85.65.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which was
forced to suspend operations at six factories, declined 2.4
percent to $33.45.    Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  dropped 3.7 percent, the biggest decline in
the S&P 500, to $36.56. Shares of the Seattle-based coffee chain
already “fully reflected” the company’s global growth
potential from an agreement to put its coffee in Green Mountain
Coffee Roasters Inc. single serve brewing systems, BMO Capital
Markets wrote in a note. Starbucks surged 9.9 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
