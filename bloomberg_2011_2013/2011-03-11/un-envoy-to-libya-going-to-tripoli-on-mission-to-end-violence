Former Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdel Ilah Al-Khatib, the special  United Nations  envoy to  Libya ,
will go to Tripoli this weekend in an effort to halt the
violence, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.  Ban said Khatib, joined by a team of senior UN humanitarian
and political officials, would meet with Libyan government
leaders. They will reiterate the UN Security Council’s demands
for an end to violence against civilians and access for delivery
of aid, Ban said.  “Their objective will be to assess the situation on the
ground and undertake broad consultations with Libyan authorities
on the immediate humanitarian, political and security
situation,” Ban told reporters at the UN in  New York .  “Our most immediate challenge is humanitarian,” Ban said.
“With each day, the death toll mounts and the situation of the
Libyan people grows more desperate. We have all seen how the
fighting has escalated. Civilians have borne the brunt of the
violence. Increasingly, they are being targeted.”  Ban said Khatib would report back to him during the
secretary-general’s trip to Egypt and  Tunisia  the weekend of
March 19-20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
