The National Football League
players union said it would only give owners another extension
of their current contract if management gave it 10 years of
audited financial records, union Executive Director  DeMaurice Smith  said.  The union set a deadline of 5 p.m. New York time for a
response.  Smith said the owners had made a new proposal and didn’t
give details.  “We informed the owners that significant differences
remain,” Smith said outside the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service building in  Washington , where the sides
have been negotiating. “We asked for 10 years of audited
financial records accompany any request for an extension.”  The union originally asked for the records almost two years
ago. Owners this week offered what league chief negotiator Jeff Pash said was the most information it ever was willing to show
to the union. The organization said it wasn’t enough.  The league and players are trying to determine how to share
$9 billion in annual revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
