The U.K. government should moderate
its planned fiscal consolidation by scaling back spending cuts,
according to Jonathan Portes, the director of the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research and a former chief
economist at the Cabinet Office.  Writing in the Financial Times, Portes said that’s a
reasonable course of action, given people’s lack of confidence
in their future spending power and the extent of spare capacity
in the economy.  He described Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne ’s
warnings of panic in the markets, credit-rating downgrades and
“Britain next in line behind Ireland and  Greece ” unless the
cuts go ahead as “scaremongering.”  Portes said there’s no evidence for the belief that a
short-term loosening would cause markets to lose confidence in
Britain’s ability to service its debt.  If Osborne wants a “Budget for growth,” measures to
improve the job prospects of the 1 million young people not in
work would be a good start, and the “misguided” scrapping of
allowances to enable young people of limited means to stay in
education should be reversed, Portes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
