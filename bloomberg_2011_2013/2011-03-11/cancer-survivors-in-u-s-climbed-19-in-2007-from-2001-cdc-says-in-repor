The number of U.S. cancer survivors
increased to 11.7 million in 2007, a 19 percent rise from 2001.  About 4.7 million Americans received their cancer diagnosis
at least 10 years earlier, according to the  Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report , published by the Atlanta-based Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. People living with  breast
cancer  are the largest group and comprised 22 percent of the
patients, followed by those with prostate cancer, representing
19 percent of the survivors.  Advances in early detection and treatment have enabled
patients to live longer with the disease and, in some cases,
made it curable, the authors of the report wrote. The aging
population contributed to the increase in people living with the
condition. Forty years ago, the number of cancer survivors was 3
million, according to the  CDC  report.  “It’s good news that so many are surviving cancer and
leading long, productive, and healthy lives,” said Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, in a statement yesterday.
“Preventing cancer and detecting it early remain critically
important as some cancers can be prevented or detected early
enough to be effectively treated.  A cancer survivor is anyone who has been diagnosed with the
condition, from the time of diagnosis until death, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
