  L’Occitane International SA (973) , the
French maker of skin-care products, soaps and perfumes, declined
the most in  Hong Kong  trading since its listing in the city
after HSBC Holdings Plc cut the stock’s rating.  L’Occitane, the first French company to hold an initial
public offering in Hong Kong, fell 7.9 percent to close at
HK$17.96, the most since its debut in May, after HSBC reduced
the rating to “neutral” from “overweight.” The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  declined 1.6 percent.  “Despite stellar sales growth, margins will be down this
year,” Erwan Rambourg, an analyst with HSBC in  London , said by
phone today. “There is no operating leverage in the business.”  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
