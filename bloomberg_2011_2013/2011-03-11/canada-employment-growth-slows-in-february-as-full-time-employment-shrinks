  Canada ’s economy added jobs for a
fifth consecutive month in February, posting a gain that was
less than economists forecast as part-time work expanded and
full-time positions declined.  Employment rose by 15,100 following an increase of 69,200
in the prior month,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. The
jobless rate was unchanged at 7.8 percent. Economists forecast
job growth of 25,000 and 7.7 percent unemployment, according to
the median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The report comes a day after the country’s trade surplus
narrowed more than economists forecast. The  Bank of Canada  kept
its key lending rate at 1 percent at its March 1 announcement
and said any interest-rate increases would be carefully
considered in a recovery that is “slightly faster” than the
central bank forecast.  “The details are a little disappointing -- for the first
two months of the year you had little growth in private
employment and full-time employment,” said  Mark Chandler , head
of Canadian currency and rates strategy at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in Toronto. The report is
still “broadly consistent” with an economic growth rate of
about 3 percent, he said.  Canada’s currency was little changed from yesterday at
97.61 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 9:43 a.m. in Toronto. Two days
ago it touched 96.68 cents, the strongest level since Nov. 15,
2007. One Canadian dollar today buys $1.0245.  Full-time Losses  Part-time employment rose by 38,900 in February, Statistics
Canada said, while full-time jobs fell by 23,800. Private
companies cut their payrolls by 20,000 and public-sector
employment increased by 9,600, the report said.  Self-employment rose by 25,500 in February, while paid
employment decreased by 10,400.  Employment growth will probably continue at a pace of
between 10,000 and 30,000 new jobs a month at a time when there
is still “considerable slack” in the labor market, said  David Tulk , chief Canada macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s
TD Securities Inc. unit, in a note to clients.  “Until this process becomes far more entrenched, there is
little pressure for the Bank to take the overnight rate
higher,” said Tulk, who predicts a July increase.  The jobless rate of 7.8 percent in February was closer to
the peak of 8.7 percent in August 2009 as the recession ended
than the 6.8 percent rate from December 2008.  Early Election  Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said his Conservative
government will stay focused on  job creation  while opposition
parties signal they may force an early election following a
March 22 budget that Harper has said will avoid major new
stimulus measures.    Michael Ignatieff  of the  Liberal Party  says he may force an
election after the Speaker of the House of Commons ruled the
government violated lawmakers’ privileges by withholding
detailed cost plans of some legislation. Ignatieff has also said
he wants to reverse corporate tax cuts that were passed in a
previous fiscal plan, and favors boosting the economy by
spending more on education and social programs.  The health care and social assistance industries led the
February jobs gain with a rise of 17,800. Accommodation and food
services employment increased by 15,300 and education jobs rose
by 13,100, Statistics Canada said.  Employment declined by 34,500 in business, building and
other support services, and public administration jobs fell by
13,500.  Wage Growth  Average hourly wages advanced 2.5 percent in February from
a year earlier, after a 2.6 percent gain in January.  Joblessness in the U.S. unexpectedly fell to 8.9 percent in
February, the lowest level in almost two years, and employers
boosted payrolls by 192,000, the Labor Department said March 4
in  Washington .  In a separate report today, Statistics Canada said the
country’s net international debt increased to the highest since
the first quarter of 1999 as foreigners boosted their investment
in bonds. The shortfall rose by C$35.4 billion ($36.2 billion)
to C$254.3 billion in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
