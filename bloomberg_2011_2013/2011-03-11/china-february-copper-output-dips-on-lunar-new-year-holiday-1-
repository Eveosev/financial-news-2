Copper output in  China , the largest
user, dropped in February from the previous month as smelters
suspended capacity during the Lunar New Year holiday.  Production of refined copper was 386,000 metric tons, 5.6
percent lower than in January, according to Bloomberg News
calculations. Still, output was 7.9 percent higher than the same
month a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of
Statistics. Financial markets closed for the week-long holiday
that started Feb. 2.  Copper futures advanced to a record $10,190 a ton on the  London  Metal Exchange last month, after rising 30 percent in
2010, as demand outpaced supply and the global economy
recovered. China’s industrial production in the first two months
of this year gained 14.1 percent, accelerating from 13.5 percent
in December, bureau data show.  “The dip in February was due to the long Chinese New Year
holidays,” Zhu Lin, an analyst at data provider Shanghai Metals
Market, said by phone. “Both the January and February data are
in line with our expectations.”  Refined copper output expanded to an all-time high of
444,000 tons in December as record prices prompted smelters to
ramp up production.  Copper in London gained as much as 0.9 percent to $9,275 a
ton today, paring the worst weekly slump since June.  -  Helen Sun . With assistance from Jae Hur and Ichiro Suzuki in
