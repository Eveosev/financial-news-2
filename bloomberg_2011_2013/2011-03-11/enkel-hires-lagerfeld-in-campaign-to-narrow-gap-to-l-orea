Henkel AG has hired fashion
designer Karl Lagerfeld for its hair-care division’s biggest
event-marketing campaign, which aims to help Schwarzkopf shampoo
gain ground on larger competitor  L’Oreal SA (OR) ’s brands.  “We want to give Schwarzkopf a more trendy and fashion-
oriented image,” Tina Mueller, Henkel’s chief marketing officer
for cosmetics, said in an interview in Dusseldorf today.
Schwarzkopf ranks second in  Europe ’s hair-care market, she said.  Lagerfeld has designed a three-floor exhibition and hair-
treatment pavilion to attract visitors to the Eurovision Song
Contest, Europe’s biggest TV event, where Henkel is the main
sponsor. The building will move from Dusseldorf,  Germany , where
Henkel is based and this year’s contest takes place on May 14,
to Milan and Paris later this year, Mueller said today at a
press conference.  Schwarzkopf, with products that cost from 2.49 euros
($3.44) for a shampoo to 29 euros for hair extensions, is the
fastest-growing brand in Henkel’s beauty division, the source of
more than 20 percent of annual revenue, Mueller said. The
division, which also sells toothpaste and skin creams, overtook  Procter & Gamble Co (PG)  and  Unilever NV (UNA)  last year to become Europe’s
second-biggest supplier in these segments, she added.  Henkel expects 140 million television spectators to follow
the Eurovision event, more than any other TV event this year in
Europe, Mueller said. She declined to say how much Henkel will
spend for the Lagerfeld campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
