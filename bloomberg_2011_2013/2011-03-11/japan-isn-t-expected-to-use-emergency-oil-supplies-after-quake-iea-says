The  International Energy Agency 
doesn’t expect Japan to use its emergency crude and oil-product
stockpiles after an earthquake today, said Aad van Bohemen, the
head of emergency policy at the Paris-based organization.  Many of the refineries that were shut as a precaution “can
come back online” after initial safety assessments are
conducted, van Bohemen said by telephone. “So far as we can
see, the impact on the oil sector is limited.”  Japan’s oil industry has supplies of crude and refined
products to cover net imports for 77 days while government
supplies, which are mainly comprised of crude, stand at 93 days,
he said.  The country imports oil and processes most of it into fuel
domestically, van Bohemen said. Any release of emergency
stockpiles would likely consist of refined products, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
