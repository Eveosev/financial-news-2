The yen won’t gain 20 percent
versus the dollar as it did during the three-month aftermath of
the 6.9 magnitude earthquake in Kobe, Japan in 1995, according
to Nomura Holdings Inc.  The Japanese currency gained the most since August against
the dollar today after the worst earthquake in at least a
century struck Japan, spurring domestic investors to buy the
currency as a haven. Jens Nordvig, a managing director of
currency research in  New York  in a conference call with clients
today.  On 1995 Comparison:  “If you look how the yen traded right after the earthquake
in 1995 it really didn’t move at all.  “The big decline in dollar-yen only happened with a month
and a half lag and coincided with the collapse of Barings Bank.  On Growth:  “There is not currently a strong correlation between gross
domestic product and yen valuation. That is not going to be the
channel we focus the most on.”  On Capital Outflows:  “We’re not going to see large-scale repatriation as a
function of this earthquake and therefore those flows are not
going to generate a move in dollar-yen at this point.  “Life insurance companies in particular have big
portfolios of foreign assets in Japan, but at this juncture they
have that largely hedged back in to yen.”  Life insurers’ hedge ratio may be close to 80 percent,
compared with about 30 percent in 1995, Nordvig said.    Bank of Japan  Policy:  “Rates are already zero in Japan and therefore we’re not
going to have the same impact on overnight rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
