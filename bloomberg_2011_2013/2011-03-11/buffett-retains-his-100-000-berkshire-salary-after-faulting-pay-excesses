  Warren Buffett , the billionaire
chief executive officer of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , was paid a
$100,000 salary for a 30th straight year after warning that
excessive executive compensation can hurt shareholders.  Buffett, 80, received no bonus in 2010 and he doesn’t get  stock options  or grants, the Omaha, Nebraska-based firm said
today in a filing. Buffett’s personal and home-security services
paid for by Berkshire cost $349,946. The company’s compensation
committee has determined salaries since 2004. Buffett,
Berkshire’s chairman and largest shareholder, formerly
recommended his own salary to the board.  Buffett built Berkshire over four decades of acquisitions
and stock picks, bringing the value of his personal stake in the
company to about $50 billion, almost all of which he has pledged
to charity. He has said  executive compensation  needs to be more
closely tied to a company’s long-term performance, rather than
to annual profits that may be wiped out.  “His own frustration with regard to executive pay
practices is reflected in not only talking the talk, but he and
his organization walk the walk,” said Frank Glassner, CEO of
 Veritas Executive Compensation Consultants  in  San Francisco .
“He in the past noted he considers himself the ‘Typhoid Mary’
of compensation committees, so he very clearly believes in his
mantra, that total shareholder return must take place before the
executives are paid.”  Berkshire Class A shares rose about 21 percent in 2010 to
$120,450 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has climbed
another 5.7 percent this year to $127,346 as of 2:31 p.m.  Buffett told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in May
that top executives must be held responsible for the performance
of companies that falter.  At the Top  “You need a person at the top who has all the downside
that somebody has that loses their job working at an auto
factory,” he said in an interview released by the panel in
February. If a company fails, management should “give back five
times the highest compensation they received in the previous
five years.”  Berkshire was a failing textile manufacturer trading at
about $15 when Buffett took control in 1965. Its net income last
year climbed 61 percent to $13 billion, the highest since 2007.
Shareholder equity, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose
20 percent to $157.3 billion from  $131.1 billion  in 2009.  Buffett assembled an enterprise with businesses ranging
from car insurance and underwear to ice cream and corporate jet
leasing. Berkshire is the largest shareholder in  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) 
and  Wells Fargo & Co ., and last year it paid $26.5 billion to
acquire railroad Burlington Northern  Santa Fe .  Charles Munger  Vice Chairman Charles Munger, 87, again received a salary
of $100,000, while Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg, 61, got
$912,500, compared with $862,500 in 2009, the filing shows. For
his own salary, Buffett told the firm’s committee “that he
would not expect or desire such compensation to increase in the
future,” according to the filing.  Buffett also received $75,000 in fees for his work on the
board of the Washington Post Co., the publishing company in
which Berkshire has a stake, the filing shows.  Todd Combs, the former hedge-fund manager hired to help
oversee Berkshire’s investment portfolio, starting with a pool
of $1 billion to $3 billion, will receive a salary and also a
contingent payment based on performance relative to the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index.  “The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior
by general partners who have received huge payouts on the upside
and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away
rich,” Buffett said in his  annual letter  to shareholders on
Feb. 26. “We have arrangements in place for deferrals and carry
forwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met by
undeserved payments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
