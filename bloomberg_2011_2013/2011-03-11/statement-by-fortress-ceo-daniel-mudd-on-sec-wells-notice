Daniel Mudd, Chief Executive
Officer of  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , issued the following
statement to Bloomberg News today:  “I have been informed that the SEC staff has sent my
counsel a Wells Notice arising out of my service at  Fannie Mae .
In keeping with SEC procedures, I intend to submit a written
response that will make clear why the SEC staff should not
pursue any action in this matter.  “The disclosures and procedures that are the subject of
the staff’s investigation were accurate and complete. These
disclosures were previewed by federal regulators, and have been
issued in the same form since the company went into government
conservatorship.  “As the executive responsible for initially registering
Fannie Mae with the SEC, and having led the company through the
SEC-mandated restatement, I have the highest respect for the
Commission. Nevertheless, I could not disagree more with this
turn of events.”
