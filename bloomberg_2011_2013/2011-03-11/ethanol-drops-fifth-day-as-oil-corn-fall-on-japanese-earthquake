Ethanol futures dropped for a fifth
day in  Chicago  as crude oil, gasoline and corn declined on
concern that the strongest earthquake ever recorded in Japan
will limit consumption.  The grain-based gasoline additive extended its longest
streak of losses since January after Japan, the largest buyer of
U.S. corn and the world’s third-largest oil consumer, was hit by
a 8.9-magnitude quake that killed hundreds of people.  “Right now, there’s a lot of fear in the market with
Japan,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFG Best in Chicago.
“That’s set a bearish tone.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 5.8 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.449 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
lowest price since Feb. 22 and the longest streak of losses
since Jan. 7. Futures are up 3 percent this year and have fallen
6.5 percent this week, the first weekly decline since Jan. 28.  In cash market trading ethanol in the U.S. Gulf plunged 9
cents, or 3.4 percent, to $2.535 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive decreased 5.5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.455,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast slid 5.5 cents, or 2.1 percent,
to $2.62 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel slipped 4.5 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $2.555.  Corn futures for May delivery tumbled 18.5 cents, or 2.7
percent, to close at $6.6425 a bushel. One bushel of the grain
makes about 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Oil for April delivery dropped $1.54 to $101.16 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
March 1. Oil decreased 3.1 percent this week and has risen 23
percent in the past year.  Gasoline for April delivery fell 3.19 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $2.9877 a gallon in New York. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  An average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing about 5
cents, according to Ag Trader Talk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
