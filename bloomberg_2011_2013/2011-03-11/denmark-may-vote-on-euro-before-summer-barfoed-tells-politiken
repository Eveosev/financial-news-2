Denmark may hold a referendum on
its European Union optouts, including joining the euro, before
the summer, newspaper Politiken reported today, citing Lars
Barfoed, deputy prime minister and the leader of the  Conservative Party .   "We have to deal with both the euro and the other optouts,"
Barfoed said according to Copenhagen-based Politiken. "You wonâ€™t
get me to set a precise date, but depending on how the euro pact
develops, it makes a referendum a lot more relevant."    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
