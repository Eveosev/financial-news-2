  Sony Corp. (6758)  halted operations at six
factories in the Tohoku region of northeastern Japan after an
earthquake, said Yasuhiro Okada, a spokesman at the Tokyo-based
company.  All employees at the factories have been evacuated, he
said. The company is assessing the fallout from power outages
and damages to buildings, he said.  One factory making Blu-ray discs and magnetic tapes in
Tagajo City, Miyagi Prefecture, had its ground floor flooded,
said Shinji Obana, another Sony spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
