Wheat prices fell for a fourth day
in  South Africa , the longest streak since September, as U.S.
futures headed for their biggest weekly decline in more than two
years.  Wheat for May delivery, the most active contract on the
South African Futures Exchange, dropped 62 rand, or 2 percent,
to 2,985 rand ($430) a metric ton at the 12 p.m. close of trade
in Johannesburg.  In  Chicago , May-delivery wheat slid as much as 2.1 percent
to $7.2525 a bushel in electronic trading today, set for a 13
percent slump this week, the worst performance since December
2008, after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  raised global
supply estimates.  In South Africa, white corn for July delivery dropped 77
rand, or 4.8 percent, to 1,542 rand. Meal made from the grain is
the countryâ€™s staple food. Yellow corn for July delivery fell 69
rand, or 4.2 percent, to 1,589 rand a ton. The country mainly
uses the grain as  animal feed .  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
