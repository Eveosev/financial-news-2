California Governor  Jerry Brown , a
Democrat, is having talks with Republican lawmakers over budget
proposals, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified
people.   At least some of five Republicans in the state Senate may
support Brown’s plans for a ballot initiative on extending tax
increases, if they get enough concessions from the governor,
according to the report. The Republicans are Tom Berryhill, Sam
Blakeslee, Anthony Cannella, Bill Emmerson and Tom Harman, the
WSJ said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
