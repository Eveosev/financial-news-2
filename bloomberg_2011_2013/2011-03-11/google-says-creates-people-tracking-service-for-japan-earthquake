  Google Inc. (GOOG)  says it has set up an
online database to help locate people in Japan after the country
was struck by its strongest earthquake in at least a century.  The  Google Person Finder  service, which collects
information about people’s locations and their safety status, is
intended to help users find out if their friends and families
are safe, the U.S. Internet company said in a Google  blog  post
today.  Google, owner of the world’s most-popular search-engine,
created a similar database in  New Zealand  last month after the
earthquake in Christchurch.  The URL of the Google Person Finder service for Japan is  http://japan.person-finder.appspot.com/?lang=ja   To contact the reporter on this story:  Mark Lee  in  Hong Kong  at
