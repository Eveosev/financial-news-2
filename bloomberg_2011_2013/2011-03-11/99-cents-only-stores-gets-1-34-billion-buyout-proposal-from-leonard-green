  99 Cents Only Stores (NDN) , the U.S.
discount chain, received a proposal to be taken private by
members of the Schiffer-Gold founding family and Leonard Green &
Partners LP, in a deal valuing the company at $1.34 billion.  The $19.09-per-share offer represented a 14.4 percent
premium on yesterday’s closing price. The City of Commerce,
California-based company will consider the proposal, according
to a statement today.  Dollar stores have become takeover targets in the U.S.
after luring shoppers away from traditional retail chains
including  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)   Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO) 
rejected an unsolicited bid by  Nelson Peltz ’s Trian Fund
Management LP last week, saying it undervalues its business.  “The dollar store chains are attractive to private equity
because they can take on more debt, accelerate store growth and
improve operations,” Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey
Advisory Group in  New York , said today in a telephone interview.
“The companies generate consistent  cash flow .”  At $19.09 a share, the offer values 99 Cents Only Stores at
about eight times the last 12 months’ earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization. That compares with a
median of 9 times Ebitda in seven bids for U.S. discount
retailers since 2008. Trian’s offer for Family Dollar was about
10 times Ebitda.  Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, said yesterday it’s
considering acquisitions to boost U.S. revenue from smaller
stores, as the dollar store industry, led by Dollar General
Group, lures shoppers who prefer quicker trips when buying tooth
paste, cleaning supplies and packaged foods.  No Debt  Led by Chief Executive Eric Schiffer, 99 Cents Stores Only,
as of Dec. 25, had no debt and cash of $24 million, an increase
of 21 percent from a year earlier, according to its third
quarter earnings statement Feb. 2. During the period, revenue
advanced 1.8 percent to $365.4 million.  Founded in 1982, the retailer operates 210 stores in  California  as well as outlets in Texas, Arizona and  Nevada ,
according to the statement. The company generates more than half
its sales from food and beverages, the company said.  The Schiffer-Gold family owns about 33 percent of the
company’s outstanding common shares and planned to use a
substantial portion of the stake to take 99 Cents Only Stores
private, according to the statement.  99 Cents Only Stores climbed $2.90, or 17 percent, to
$19.58 at 4:05 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, the biggest increase since June, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
