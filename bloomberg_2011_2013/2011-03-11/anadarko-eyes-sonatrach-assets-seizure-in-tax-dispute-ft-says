  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  has looked
at seizing the foreign assets of Sonatrach, its state-owned
partner in  Algeria , to enforce judgment if it wins a $3 billion
claim over an Algerian windfall tax on oil, the Financial Times
reported, citing diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks that
itâ€™s reviewed.  The U.S. company argues that a tax on exceptional oil
profits brought in by Algeria five years ago breaches an
agreement it signed with Sonatrach in 1989; an arbitration
hearing on the dispute is scheduled to take place in Paris in
June, the newspaper said.  Dick Holmes, the president of Anadarko Algeria, has told
diplomats his lawyers are sure the arbitration decision will be
enforceable, if not in Algeria, then through the seizure of
Sonatrach assets abroad, according to a cable sent in February
2010, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
