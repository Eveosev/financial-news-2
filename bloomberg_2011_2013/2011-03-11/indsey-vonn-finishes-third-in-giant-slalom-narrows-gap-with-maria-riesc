  Lindsey Vonn  narrowed the gap with
Maria Riesch in the overall standings of the skiing  World Cup  by
taking third place in the giant slalom today.  Vonn of the U.S. posted her best-result ever in the event,
finishing at 1.45 seconds behind winner  Viktoria Rebensburg  of  Germany  in the Czech resort of Spindleruv Mlyn. Italy’s  Denise
Karbon  was in second place, 1.26 seconds back.  Riesch finished last at 6.43 seconds after making a mistake
in the second run of the race. Vonn now trails the German by 38
points in the overall World Cup, with five races remaining.
Vonn, the downhill champion at the Vancouver Winter Games, is
seeking a fourth straight overall  world cup  title.  The women’s world cup continues tomorrow in Spindleruv Mlyn
with the slalom. A victory is worth 100 points in the standings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
