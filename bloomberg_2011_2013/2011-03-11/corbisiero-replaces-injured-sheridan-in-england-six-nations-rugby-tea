Alex Corbisiero will replace Andrew
Sheridan at loosehead prop in the  England  lineup for the Six
Nations rugby match against  Scotland  in two days.  Sheridan tore a calf muscle in England’s 17-9 win over  France  on Feb. 26. Manager  Martin Johnson  also made two changes
to his bench for the game at Twickenham Stadium in  London  as
flanker Tom Croft returns for the first time since injuring his
shoulder against South Africa in November to replace Hendrie
Fourie and Paul Doran-Jones takes Corbisiero’s spot.  England is unbeaten after three matches to lead the
standings by two points over Wales, France and Ireland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
