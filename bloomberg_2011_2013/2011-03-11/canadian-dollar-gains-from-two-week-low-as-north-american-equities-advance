  Canada ’s dollar gained versus its
U.S. counterpart, rising for a fourth straight week, as North
American stocks overcame a global equity slump spurred by
Japan’s strongest earthquake on record and advanced.  The loonie, as the currency is also known for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, earlier touched the lowest
level in two weeks after Canada’s economy added fewer jobs last
month than forecast. Oil, the nation’s biggest export, fell
below $100 a barrel following the temblor in Japan, the world’s
third-largest consumer of the commodity.  “We moved away from  risk aversion ,” said  David Watt ,
senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
Markets unit in Toronto. “There are other things going on that
are taking a bit of pressure off oil markets and taking pressure
off risk sentiment.”  Canada’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 97.32 cents
per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, after declining as much as
0.4 percent to 98.03 cents, the weakest level since Feb. 25. It
gained less than 0.1 percent over the past five days, rising on
March 9 to 96.68 cents, the strongest since Nov. 15, 2007. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0275.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.7 percent after
falling 0.2 percent. Crude oil for April delivery dropped as
much as 3.6 percent to $99.01 a barrel in New York before
trading at $100.60. It last cost less than $100 on March 2.  Libya, Saudi Arabia  European stocks fell earlier as Libyan forces loyal to
Colonel  Muammar Qaddafi  bombarded rebels in control of oil
installations in Ras Lanuf. In  Saudi Arabia , protesters stayed
away from a so-called Day of Rage after police were deployed in
force to deter political activists.  The euro erased losses against the Canadian dollar today as
European Union leaders met in Brussels in the first of two
summits this month that aim to reach an agreement on how to
contain the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. The 17-nation
currency gained 0.5 percent to C$1.3531.  The Canadian currency lost 0.8 percent yesterday versus the
greenback after Canada’s trade surplus narrowed in January to
C$116 million ($119 million), more than economists anticipated,
and U.S. jobless-benefit claims rose last week to 397,000, more
than forecast.  Canadian employers added a net 15,100 jobs after a gain of
69,200 in January, Statistics Canada data showed today in
Ottawa. The median forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for an increase of 25,000. The  unemployment rate 
stayed at 7.8 percent.  Pared Losses  The loonie pared early losses after retail sales in the
U.S., its biggest trade partner, rose in February by the most in
four months, spurred by job gains and more seasonable
temperatures. The 1 percent increase in purchases followed a
revised 0.7 percent rise in January that was more than double
the previous estimate, Commerce Department figures showed today.  Canada’s shorter-term government bonds rose, pushing the
yield on the two-year note down three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.75 percent. It touched 1.73 percent, the
lowest level since Feb. 2. The price of the 1.75 percent
security due in March 2013 increased 6 cents to C$100.01. The
benchmark 10-year note yield was little changed at 3.27 percent.  The Canadian and U.S. dollars fell against most of their
major peers. The yen was the top performer among the greenback’s
16 most-traded counterparts as the earthquake in Japan spurred
domestic investors to buy the currency.  To contact the reporter for this story:
