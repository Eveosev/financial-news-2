(Corrects the name of the plant in the first paragraph.)  One person is confirmed dead at
Tokyo Electric Power Co.â€™s Dai-Ni nuclear power plant in
Fukushima, company spokesman Atsushi Sugiyama said. Two from the
Dai-Ichi plant are missing, he said.  About 5,800 residents living near the Dai-Ichi reactor were
ordered to leave their homes late yesterday and Cabinet
Secretary Yukio Edano said today there is a possibility the
reactor may leak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
