The pound reached its lowest level
in a month against the dollar as data showed U.K. producer-price
inflation slowed in February and investors trimmed bets that the  Bank of England  will raise interest rates.  Britain’s currency weakened for a second day against the
euro. Output prices increased 0.5 percent from January, when
they rose 1.1 percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said
today. The median forecast of 16 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 0.6 percent increase. The central bank kept its
borrowing costs at a record low of 0.5 percent yesterday as
policy makers chose to set aside concern on rising inflation
pressures to support the economic recovery.  “The general outlook for U.K. rate hikes has come off,”
said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and
institutional treasury desk at Investec Plc in  London . “The
pound has had a decent couple of weeks against the dollar, and
we’re seeing it dip back down now.”  The pound weakened 0.3 percent to $1.6020 as of 4:19 p.m.
in London after reaching $1.5977, the weakest since Jan. 28. It
was 1.5 percent lower in the week, the biggest decline since the
five trading days ending Dec. 17. Sterling depreciated 0.5
percent to 86.24 pence per euro.  Short-sterling futures advanced, pushing the implied yield
on the contract expiring in December down 11 basis points to
1.45 percent, as investors cut bets on higher interest rates.
The yield has risen from 1.25 percent at the end of last year.  Rate Bets  Investors are betting the London-based central bank will
raise its benchmark rate 25 basis points to 0.75 percent at its
August meeting, according to forward contracts on the sterling
overnight interbank average, or Sonia. The data, compiled by
Tullett Prebon Plc, yesterday signaled a 25 basis-point increase
at the July meeting. The central bank hasn’t adjusted  interest
rates  since March 2009.  “There’s some disappointment regarding rate-hike
expectations,” said You-Na Park, a currency strategist at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “The pound has come under pressure
after the Bank of England kept rates unchanged yesterday.”  Bank of England Governor Mervyn King is due to give a
speech on the stability of the international monetary and
financial system at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy
Research in  San Francisco  later today.  Home Prices  Britain’s currency declined even as a report showed the
average price of a home in England and  Wales  rose 0.3 percent in
February to 222,456 pounds from a month earlier. Values fell 0.5
percent from a year earlier, the first annual decline since
October 2009, research company Acadametrics Ltd. and LSL
Property Services Plc said.  U.K. stocks fell to a three-month low after an 8.9-
magnitude earthquake and tsunami struck northern Japan. The
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  retreated as much as 0.8 percent to the
lowest level since Dec. 10.  U.K. government bonds rose, pushing the yield on the 10-
year gilt down six basis points to 3.54 percent. The 4.75
percent security due March 2020 rose 0.47, or 4.7 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 109.26. Two-year note yields were
seven basis points lower at 1.28 percent.  The nation’s debt management office sold 4.5 billion pounds
of 28-, 91- and 182-day bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
