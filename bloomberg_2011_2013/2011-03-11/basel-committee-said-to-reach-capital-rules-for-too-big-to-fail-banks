Global regulators this week agreed
on additional capital rules for banks whose failure would
disrupt the global economy, according to two people familiar
with the discussions.  The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  decided lenders
will face a sliding scale of additional  capital requirements 
based on their size, interconnectedness with other financial
institutions, scale of international operations and the ability
for other banks to absorb its functions, said one of the people,
who declined to be identified because the talks are private.  Instead of creating a fixed list of too-big-to-fail
lenders, regulators will instead regularly evaluate which
lenders should face capital surcharges, one of the people said.  The Group of 20 nations said in November lenders that
threaten the wider financial system if they collapse should face
tougher capital rules, to help them to cover any losses. The G-
20 asked the Basel committee to draft the  global
requirements  for the systemically important banks.  Regulators havenâ€™t completed discussions on whether the
surcharges must be comprised solely of bank shares and retained
earnings, the purest form of capital recognized by the Basel
committee, the people said. Bonds that can be converted to
equity if necessary may still be allowed to make up part of the
surcharges.  An FSB working group is scheduled to discuss the Basel
agreements on March 14, one of the people said.  Marisa Bourtin, a spokeswoman for the Basel committee,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
