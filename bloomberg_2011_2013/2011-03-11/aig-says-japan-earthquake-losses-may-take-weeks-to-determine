  American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out U.S. insurer, said it will take time to determine
the scope of losses tied to the earthquake in Japan.  “We are working on assessing insured losses but it will
take time for insurers to be able to assess the full magnitude
of the event,” Mark Herr, a spokesman for New York-based AIG,
said in an e-mailed statement. “Right now, we are only
concerned with ensuring the safety of our employees and
customers. We stand ready to help support the people of Japan.”  AIG revised an earlier statement that said an assessment of
losses caused by the 8.9-magnitude earthquake that killed
hundreds would take “days, if not weeks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
