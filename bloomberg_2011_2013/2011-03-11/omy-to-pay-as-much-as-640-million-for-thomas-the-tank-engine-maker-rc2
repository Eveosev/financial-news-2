Tomy Co., the Japanese maker of
Transformers and Pokemon toys, agreed to buy  RC2 Corp. (RCRC)  for $640
million to add Thomas the Tank Engine products in  North America 
as a declining birth rate erodes demand at home.  The offer is valued at $27.90 a share in cash, 27 percent
more than the March 9 closing price,  Oak Brook , Illinois-based
RC2 and Tokyo-based Tomy said yesterday in a statement.  Tomy is targeting overseas acquisitions to revive growth as
falling birth rates in Japan, which contributed to two straight
annual declines in revenue, crimps demand for new toys.
The offer is priced at 10.5 times estimated earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared with a
median multiple of 10.6 for Japanese acquisitions of overseas 
companies in the past 12 months, according to data compiled 
by Bloomberg.  “The price for RC2 seems a little high when you consider
the future of the toy market,” said Takao Suzuki, an analyst at
Toward the Infinite World Inc. in Tokyo with a “neutral plus”
rating on the shares. “M&A is the right strategy. The domestic
toy market won’t grow because there are fewer children.”  Japan’s population is shrinking from a peak of 127.8
million in December 2004, according to the nation’s  Statistics
Bureau . The proportion of the population ages 0-14 decreased to
an estimated 13 percent last year from 14.6 percent a decade
earlier and may fall to 10.8 percent by 2020, according to the
agency.  Offer Value  Tomy rose 1.3 percent to 698 yen as of 12:30 p.m. in Tokyo
trading. RC2 stock surged 16 percent to $25.51 yesterday in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  Japanese companies are stepping up acquisitions overseas
after the yen strengthened to a 15-year high against the dollar
last year. The currency traded at 82.80 against the dollar as of
12:49 p.m. in Tokyo.  The acquisition of RC2 would be the largest of a toymaker
since the  Carlyle Group  agreed to buy a majority stake in
Oriental Trading Co. from Brentwood Associates in June 2006 for
$1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg data.  “This merger further enables Tomy to move towards our goal
of increasing our global profile adding significant additional
business in North America and  Europe ,” President Kantaro Tomiyama said in the statement.  Deal Advisers  Tomy is being advised by Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch unit while Robert W. Baird & Co. is advising RC2.  In addition to Thomas, RC2 makes products under the
Learning Curve, Johnny Lightning and Ertl brands.  The Thomas character, who lives on the fictional island of
Sodor, was created as part a series of children’s books by
Wilbert Awdry in the 1940s. The character was later used for
toys and a television series narrated by former Beatle Ringo Starr.  Apax Partners LLP owns the Thomas the Tank Engine brand
through its HIT Entertainment Ltd., which it acquired in 2005
for 489.4 million pounds ($787 million). The brand is licensed
in specific markets to companies including Tomy and RC2.  Haim Saban and former Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive
Officer Michael Eisner are among parties considering bids for
HIT, people with knowledge of the situation said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
