First Utility Ltd., a British
energy-supply company, urged the government to force producers
to trade more power as it prepares to revamp the  electricity
market .  The government, looking to replace about a third of
Britain’s aging power stations in the next decade, said it got
more than 200 comments on its proposal to overhaul the
electricity market. The deadline for responses was yesterday,
and they will be incorporated into legislation late this year.  The U.K. plans includes a minimum levy for emitting carbon-
dioxide, pollution limits on new power stations, compensation to
reduce electricity demand, and fixed payments for nuclear and
wind generation. The  new legislation  gives the government a
chance to improve competition in a market dominated by six large
producers, Darren Braham, chief financial officer of Warwick,
England-based First Utility, said in an interview.  “Forcing the Big Six to trade their generation volumes on
the wholesale market would immediately increase liquidity, which
would be to the benefit of all players, not just new entrants,”
Braham said. “Unless you’ve got a very liquid wholesale market,
it makes it very difficult for retail competition to truly
flourish.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
