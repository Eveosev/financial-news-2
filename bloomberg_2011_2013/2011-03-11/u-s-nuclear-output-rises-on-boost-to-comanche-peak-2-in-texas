U.S. nuclear-power output rose 0.4
percent as Energy Future Holdings Corp. boosted production by
the Comanche Peak 2 reactor in  Texas , the  Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  said.  Output nationwide increased by 390 megawatts to 87,914
megawatts, or 87 percent of capacity, according to a report
today from the NRC and data compiled by Bloomberg. Fourteen of
the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Energy Future raised output at the 1,150-megawatt Comanche
Peak 2 to full power from 77 percent of capacity yesterday.  The Comanche Peak plant, which has two units, is 66 miles
(106 kilometers) southwest of Dallas. The 1,200-megawatt
Comanche Peak 1 was operating at full power.    PPL Corp. (PPL)  boosted its 1,149-megawatt Susquehanna 1 reactor
in Pennsylvania, 50 miles northwest of Allentown, to 17 percent
of capacity from 9 percent yesterday. The 1,140-megawatt
Susquehanna 2 unit was operating at 94 percent of capacity.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
