Hungarian bonds rose from the
weakest level in two weeks after February inflation matched
economists’ forecast, boosting speculation the central bank will
keep its key  interest rates  unchanged this month.  The  government bonds  due in 2014 advanced, pushing the
yield 7 basis points lower to 6.771 percent at 10:31 a.m. in
Budapest. That’s down from 6.836 percent yesterday, the highest
level since Feb. 24.  Hungarian inflation rose to 4.1 percent from 4 percent.
Policy makers had cited accelerating inflation for raising
benchmark interest rates by 0.75 percentage point between
November and January. The central bank considered the increases
sufficient to steer inflation toward their 3 percent target,
central bank President Andras Simor said on Feb. 21 after the
bank left the rate at 6 percent.  “We still do not expect more rate hikes from the central
bank,” Zsolt Kondrat, head of research at MKB Bank, the local
unit of  Bayerische Landesbank , wrote in a research report after
the data was released. “The central bank’s November inflation
forecast envisaged 4.5 percent average inflation in the first
quarter of 2011, but now we would need a miracle to reach such a
high level.”  The forint strengthened 0.1 percent to 273.62 per euro, and
the benchmark BUX index of shares increased 0.2 percent to
22,143.86.  To contact the reporter on this story:
