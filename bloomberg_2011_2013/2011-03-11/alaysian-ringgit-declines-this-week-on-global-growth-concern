Malaysia’s ringgit fell this week
on concern conflict in  Libya  and protests in  Saudi Arabia , the
Middle East’s biggest crude producer, will disrupt oil supply
and slow global growth.  The currency dropped to its lowest level in more than a
week as an 8.9 magnitude earthquake, the world’s strongest in
more than six years, struck the coast of Japan. Bank Negara
Malaysia meets today with 16 out of 20 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predicting policy makers will keep the overnight rate
at 2.75 percent to support growth. Four forecast a 25-basis
point increase. The decision is due about 6 p.m. local time.  “Traders are concerned about a sell-off in the equities
markets in  Asia , with the supply of oil potentially being
disrupted in Saudi Arabia,” said Godwin Chan, a foreign-
exchange trader at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .
“With every increase in the price of oil per barrel, the
standard of living is getting more expensive.”  The ringgit declined 0.4 percent for the week and 0.2
percent from yesterday to 3.0399 per dollar as of 4:19 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 3.0455 today, the weakest level since March 2.  Crude rose 11 percent this year to $101.29 a barrel in  New
York . Prime Minister Najib Razak said on March 9 higher fuel
costs will impact the local economy and push up state spending.
Annual subsidies will increase by 4 billion ringgit ($1.3
billion) if retail fuel prices aren’t raised to match rising oil
prices, he said.  Quake Impact  An 8.9-magnitude earthquake, the world’s strongest in more
than six years, struck the coast of Japan at 2:46 p.m. local
time today, causing a tsunami as high as 10 meters that
inundated towns north of Tokyo.  “The earthquake raised concern some economic activities
will be halted in Japan,” said  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and
currency trader at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The
earthquake led to the selling of the yen and other Asian
currencies.”  Three-year bonds rose this week and from yesterday. The
yield on the 3.434 percent note due August 2014 slipped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.38 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The price increased 0.03, or 30 sen
per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 100.18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
