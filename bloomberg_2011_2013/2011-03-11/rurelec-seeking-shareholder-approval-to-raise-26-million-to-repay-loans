  Rurelec Plc (RUR) , a London-based power
company that operates plants in  South America , plans to raise
16.3 million pounds ($26 million) in a share offering to pay off
debt.  The company is seeking shareholder approval to place 200
million shares at 9 pence each, Rurelec said today in a
statement.  The company plans to use the proceeds to pay 1.7 million
pounds of company debt, leaving it with 16.3 million pounds
before expenses, Rurelec said in the statement.  “The fundraising will place the company on a more
conservative financial footing by eliminating debt,” Peter
Earl, Rurelec’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
