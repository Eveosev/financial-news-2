A functionary for Turkish Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s ruling party resigned after
suggesting that any woman who didn’t wear an Islamic headscarf
was a prostitute,  Hurriyet  newspaper reported.  Suleyman Demirci, a media and communications officer for
the ruling Justice and Development Party in Unye, resigned after
the party warned him about remarks he wrote on his Facebook page
that were widely published in the national press, Hurriyet said.  “A woman without a headscarf is like a house without
curtains,” Demirci had posted, according to Hurriyet. “A house
without curtains is either for sale or for rent.”  Nurettin Ozgenc , the head of  Turkey ’s small business
association Kobider, came under similar scrutiny earlier this
week for saying in a written statement on International Women’s
Day that feminism was “sophistry” and  gender equality  was
“impossible,” Hurriyet said.  “The plug is not equal to the socket,” the newspaper
quoted Ozgenc as saying in a statement on March 8. Women should
give up on the “dream” of equality, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
