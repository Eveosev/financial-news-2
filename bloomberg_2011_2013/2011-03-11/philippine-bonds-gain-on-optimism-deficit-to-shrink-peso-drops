The Philippine peso fell today,
completing its biggest weekly loss since December, and six-year
bonds dropped as the yen weakened after an 8.9-magnitude
earthquake struck Japan.  The yen touched its lowest level in two weeks against the
dollar after a tsunami of more than 10 meters was reported in
northern Japan. The peso, which was trading 0.1 percent lower
before the quake struck, weakened to as much as 0.5 percent on
news of the temblor.  “There’s some knee-jerk reaction in the  currency market 
reacting to fears that there may be a dent in inter-Asia
demand,” said  Vishnu Varathan , an economist in Singapore at  Capital Economics  (Asia) Pte.  The peso lost 0.4 percent today to 43.65 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. That took the currency’s losses
for the week to 0.9 percent, the biggest drop since the five
days ended Dec. 17.  The yield on the 7 percent bond due January 2016 rose five
basis points today to 6.20 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services. The rate was little changed this week. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter for this story:
