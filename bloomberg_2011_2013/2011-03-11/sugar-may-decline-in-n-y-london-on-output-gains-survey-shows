Sugar may decline next week on
speculation that demand will be met by increased global output.  Eight of 12 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar traded in  New York  will fall,
while one said it will rise. Three were neutral. Before today,
the commodity dropped 3.9 percent this week to 28.71 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S.  Eight of 12 survey respondents said refined sugar on
London’s NYSE Liffe exchange will drop, and two said it will
gain. Two were neutral.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener will widen,
according to six of 11 people surveyed. Three said it will
narrow, and two expect it to be little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
