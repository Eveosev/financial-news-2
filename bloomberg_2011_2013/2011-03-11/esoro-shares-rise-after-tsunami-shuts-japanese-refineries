  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) , the refiner with
three plants on the U.S. West Coast, rose the most of any
company in the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index, after a tsunami
induced by Japan’s worst earthquake in at least a century soaked
the country and forced the closure of refineries and power
plants there.  The company, based in  San Antonio , rose $1.91, or 8.4
percent, to $24.51 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Tesoro may see more demand if its refineries have to help
fill the void left by others knocked out in Japan, Ann Kohler,
an analyst at CRT Capital Group in Stamford, Connecticut, said
in a phone interview.  “If there is longer term damage to those refineries, that
need would have to be met by other refiners in the Pacific
Basin,” said Kohler, who rates the shares a “buy.”  A Cosmo Oil Co. refinery east of Tokyo was engulfed in
flames and closed, as were three other refineries, 11 nuclear
reactors after a devastating tsunami followed an offshore
earthquake.  Tesoro said in a news release Friday that the tsunami
cascading through the Pacific Ocean had left its Hawaii and
Alaska refineries unaffected.  Other U.S. refiners posted gains of 5 percent or more
today, including  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ,  Holly Corp. (HOC) ,  Frontier Oil
Corp. (FTO) ,  Western Refining Inc. (WNR) , Delek US Holdings Inc.,  CVR Energy
Inc. (CVI)  and  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)   Valero today announced plans to buy Chevron Corp.’s
Pembroke refinery in the U.K.  To contact the reporters on this story:
