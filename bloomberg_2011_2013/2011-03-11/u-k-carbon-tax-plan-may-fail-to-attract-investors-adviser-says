Climate Change Capital, a London-
based investment manager and adviser, said the U.K.’s planned
carbon-dioxide tax may fail to attract investors.  Britain, seeking private financing for nuclear stations and
other forms of low-carbon generation, last year proposed an
additional CO2 charge when European Union permit prices fall
below a set level. The plan was to help investors see the
revenue benefits of funding cleaner sources of power generation
and assist the country in reducing emissions.  Investors may “have serious doubts about the long-term
credibility” of the carbon policy “because it is a tax-based
mechanism subject to annual votes in Parliament,” Rupert Edwards, head of policy and market analysis at Climate Change
Capital, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The government must  strengthen the policy  by guaranteeing a
minimum price of carbon through a contract, Climate Change
Capital said in a report. These guarantees could then be sold to
investors and be exercised if the treasury breaks its promise on
the carbon price support, according to the report.  The U.K. committed to slashing its CO2 emissions by 80
percent below 1990 levels by 2050.  To contact the reporter on this story:
