About 100 tankers are backed up at
the Russian port of St. Petersburg because of ice, a port
official said.  Ice-breaking vessels are already working in the harbor, the
official said today by phone from St. Petersburg, declining to
be identified because he isn’t authorized to speak on the
matter.  The port shipped 414,000 metric tons of fuel oil in
February, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
