  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
lender by customers, snapped four days of declines after falling
12 percent this week before today.  The shares climbed 3.1 percent to 24.75 shillings by 12:07
p.m. in Nairobi. A close at that level would be the biggest jump
in two months.  Equity Bank’s relative strength index, or RSI, sank to 20
yesterday, below the threshold of 30 that indicates a stock is
poised to rally, according to some technical analysts.  “Profit-taking has ended and it has also regained support
from investors because it is attractive at the current price,”
Anne Kahure, a research analyst at Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic
Financial Services Ltd. said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
