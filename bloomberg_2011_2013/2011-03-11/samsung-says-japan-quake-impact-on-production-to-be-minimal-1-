Samsung Electronics Co., the
world’s largest maker of televisions and memory chips, said it
expects today’s earthquake in Japan to have minimal impact on
the company’s production schedule.  Some of Samsung’s photo equipment was momentarily halted at
2:54 p.m. local time to avoid malfunction and operations
returned to normal by 4:30 p.m., the Suwon, South Korea-based
company said in an e-mailed statement.  Japan was struck by its strongest earthquake in at least a
century, an 8.9-magnitude temblor that shook buildings across
Tokyo and unleashed a tsunami as high as 10 meters, engulfing
towns along the nation’s northern coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
