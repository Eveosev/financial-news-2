  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemical maker, reported an upset and flaring related to light
hydrocarbon plant 7 in Freeport, Texas, according to a filing
with state regulators.  “There was no impact to olefin production,” Gregory Baldwin, a spokesman based at company headquarters in Midland,  Michigan , said in an e-mail today.  The flaring started at 12:18 p.m. local time and was
expected to end at 2 p.m., according to a  filing  with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.  Dow’s Freeport chemical complex is about 65 miles (105
kilometers) south of Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
