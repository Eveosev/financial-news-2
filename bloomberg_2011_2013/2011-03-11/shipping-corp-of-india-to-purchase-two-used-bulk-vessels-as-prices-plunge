Shipping Corp. of India Ltd., the
nation’s largest sea-cargo carrier, will buy two second-hand
supramax dry-bulk vessels by the end of the month as prices
plunge amid a glut of new vessels.  “There are distress sales available in the market, and we
want to take advantage,” Director Arun Kumar Gupta said
yesterday by phone from  Mumbai , where the company is based. He
declined to comment on the price the shipping line will pay.  Shipping Corp. may also issue a tender for two used panamax
ships next month and it will look to buy three 3,500-container
vessels as well, Gupta said. The government-controlled company
raised 11.6 billion rupees ($260 million) selling new shares
last year to help pay for vessels as the nation’s 8 percent-plus
economic growth stokes sea-cargo traffic.  The shipping line fell 0.2 percent to 109.25 rupee at 9:43
a.m. in Mumbai trading. It’s dropped 16 percent this year,
compared with an 11 percent decline for the benchmark Sensex
Index.  The company had planned to buy a total of 62 vessels in the
five years to 2012. It has so far ordered 35 new ships and
bought one second-hand, Gupta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
