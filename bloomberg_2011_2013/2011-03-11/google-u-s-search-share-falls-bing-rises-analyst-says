  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s share of searches in
the U.S. market declined in February while that of  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) ’s Bing increased, according to research firm ComScore Inc.  Google had 65.4 percent of searches last month, down from
65.6 percent in January, Reston, Virginia-based ComScore said.
Microsoft’s Bing search engine had 13.6 percent, up about a half
percentage point. Yahoo! Inc.’s share was unchanged at 16.1
percent.  Google, which gets most of its sales from search-engine
advertising, is trying to refine the relevance of its results
after receiving complaints that some websites game its system to
get more prominent placement. Google is rolling out a tool that
allows users to hide all listings from sites that they dislike,
find offensive or see as low quality, it said in a blog post
yesterday.  Last month, Google said it changed the way it carries out
Web searches to feature more “high-quality” sites, affecting
12 percent of queries.  Google, based in  Mountain View , California, fell $3.59 to
$576.71 on the Nasdaq Stock Market at 4 p.m. New York time.
Microsoft added 27 cents to $25.68.  To contact the reporter on this story:
