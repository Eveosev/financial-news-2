  American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
stands to reap billions of dollars in benefits from its bid to
repurchase mortgage-backed bonds from the  Federal Reserve ,
according to Wells Fargo Securities.  AIG’s shares rose as much as 3.6 percent in late trading
yesterday after the insurer disclosed its offer for the assets
of  Maiden Lane II , a fund that the Fed created during the 2007-
2009 financial crisis as part of a rescue program.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks AIG’s stock price and the value
of Maiden Lane II’s assets, as provided weekly by the Fed, since
the fund’s inception. The shares rose 30 percent from Dec. 15,
2008, when the company disclosed its sale of home mortgage-
backed debt to the fund, through yesterday.  “The company would essentially trade $15.7 billion of cash
from its investment portfolio for $15.9 billion of much higher-
yielding securities” in the fund through the proposed buyback,  John Hall , a Wells Fargo analyst, wrote today in a report.  Maiden Lane II’s holdings may yield as much as 10 percent
for AIG, he wrote. The estimate is based on the $68 million of
fourth-quarter investment income that the company earned from
the fund, to which it initially contributed $1 billion.  Buying back the debt would free up the invested funds and
eliminate $13 billion in aid that the U.S. provided to AIG, the
report said. The federal government holds a 92 percent stake in
the insurer, which has an “underperform” rating from Hall.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:  David Wilson  in New York at
