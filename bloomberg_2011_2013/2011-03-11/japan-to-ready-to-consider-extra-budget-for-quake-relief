Japan is ready to consider
compiling a supplementary budget to fund relief efforts after
it suffered the strongest earthquake in at least a century, a  Finance Ministry  official said.  The government first needs to examine the economic impact
from the magnitude 8.9 earthquake that struck the northeastern
region today, the official told reporters in Tokyo today. The
Finance Ministry may use some of the 1 trillion yen ($12
billion) held in discretionary funds, he told reporters on the
condition of anonymity, citing the ministryâ€™s policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
