Senator  Jeff Sessions , an  Alabama  Republican, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this
weekend, that there’s not much room for compromise on the
House plan to cut $61 billion in  government spending  this
year.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: And we begin the show with Senator Jeff
Sessions of Alabama. Thank you for being with us, Senator.  SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS: Thank you, Al.  HUNT: You and six of your colleagues have vowed to
block any legislation in the Senate until the deficit is
reduce in a, quote, “meaningful way.”  The continuing
resolution expires next Friday. What specifically has to -
what’s meaningful? As big as the House cuts? How long a
time?  SESSIONS: To me, that’s the House cut level. It’s the
number they’ve come up with. It’s defensible. It’s
significant. When you realize it reduces the baseline and
that over 10 years will save $860 billion in debt that we
won’t have on the books, it’s significant. And at the same
time, it’s not too much. It amounts to less than 2 percent
of the total budget, less than 6 percent -  HUNT: Would you say the Senate has to come close to
that to be acceptable to you?  SESSIONS: I do. I really believe it needs to.  HUNT: - 60 versus 61.  SESSIONS: I guess perfection is not - but I’m not here
to negotiate with myself. I really think that’s a good
number. And I think we should fight for it. You know,
Erskine Bowles testified just a few days ago before the
budget committee, and he said we were headed to a debt
crisis in about two years. Alan Simpson said one. We need
to take some steps now. This is the only bill that’s really
before us that provides us an opportunity to change the
trajectory we’re on.  HUNT: As you know, Goldman Sachs says that that bill
would result in a 2 percent reduction in economic growth
this year. Fed Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said it would result
in the loss of 200,000 jobs. Is cutting spending so
important that - even if it means temporarily losing some
jobs?  SESSIONS: I don’t believe those numbers are
defensible. I know  John Taylor , a superb economist, has
debunked them totally. You know, other -  HUNT: So you just don’t believe Bernanke or Goldman
Sachs on this?  SESSIONS: Well, it - I can’t imagine it would, because
you’re talking about a reduction of - well, first of all,
only about - a small fraction of that reduction will even
take place immediately. This deals with outlays, which will
- some of which will be three years from now. So it all
won’t impact just this year. I think they miscalculated in
that.  HUNT: You know these issues so well, so you know the
current fight for all the (inaudible) is really small ball
compared to the long-term problem. It’s only 12 percent of
the budget. There’s a bipartisan gang of six, which you’re
very familiar with in the Senate, trying to put together
some kind of a longer-term deal or bargain. The Senate
rejected both the House and the Democrats’ proposals. Do
you think the odds for their success has been enhanced? Or
has it been decreased by the last couple days?  SESSIONS: I think in the last couple of days, they’ve
been strengthened for several reasons. First, you had 10
Democrats defect from the Harry Reid Democratic proposal,
because they thought it spent too much. Maybe one thought
it didn’t spend enough. But - so I think that’s
significant. Second, we’ve had more clarity in the warnings
from people like Erskine Bowles and  Alan Simpson  -  HUNT: So you think - you’ve been a little pessimistic,
but you think now they have a shot to at least put
something out there to start with?  SESSIONS: I do. I think the momentum for containing
spending is growing, because the crisis is more real than a
lot of us like to admit. We have people who are in denial.
The president’s budget was very disappointing.  HUNT: But you - there’s no doubt of that -  (CROSSTALK)  SESSIONS: But this has the - on the question of
entitlements, that’s what that group is dealing with.  HUNT: Right.  SESSIONS: The president has got to - to step into the
game.  HUNT: Because we had a Bloomberg poll this week that
showed by 76 percent to 22 percent - no surprise to you, I
suspect - people are against cutting Medicare, don’t cut
Social Security. What Medicare and Social Security
entitlements could you address and cut back?  SESSIONS: Well, if you started now on Social Security,
you could keep that program sound for the rest of its life
without dramatic changes. So the sooner you start, the
better.  HUNT: How about Medicare?  SESSIONS: Medicare is more problematic.  HUNT: Do you think you can do it this year?  SESSIONS: Well, we could make improvements. And we
could save a lot of money. Social Security will not save a
lot of money over the next 10 years if it’s reformed.  SESSIONS: Medicare is a bigger problem, and I’m a bit
surprised we’re not focusing more on that, although a lot
of people think it’s more achievable to do Social Security.  HUNT: You mentioned Simpson-Bowles. They - and as you
say,  Alan Greenspan  - have talked about the debt cataclysm
that we face. But they also say we need to raise taxes.
Simpson-Bowles says one-third of their deficit reduction
comes from taxes. Greenspan says let all the Bush tax cuts
expire. I know you don’t agree with that. But if the
Democrats would be willing to consider entitlements, are
you willing to consider putting taxes on the table?  SESSIONS: Well, we’ve got to work together to do
something about entitlements, but we should not ignore the
impact of surging spending on discretionary spending. Under
the president’s leadership, we’ve increased discretionary
spending 23 percent. So reducing that back to 2008 levels
would be a huge step forward.  And taxes, they’ll be a bitter pill for me, but we
have got to get this country on the right path.  HUNT: So if - if the other side’s willing to really be
serious about entitlements and other spending, you - as
bitter as it would be - would at least be willing to put
taxes on the table?  SESSIONS: Well, I’d have to challenge it, but I would
look it.  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: Senator, which institution has more political
and economic power in America today, labor unions or
corporations?  SESSIONS: I don’t know. I hadn’t thought about that.
I’d say, in one sense, the unions are more coherent, more
effective in selecting their agenda and promoting them.
Businesses have often conflicting agendas as to what they
favor. But there are some things that they unite on.  HUNT: You are also on the Armed Services Committee, a
senior member of that. Some of your colleagues, like  John
McCain , have called for the U.S. and allies to initiate a
no-fly zone in  Libya . Secretary Gates says, hey, that’s a
problem, that’s problematic. What if anything should the
U.S. do to help stop Qaddafi? And do you think Qaddafi is
winning this thing now?  SESSIONS: I’m worried about it. And I think about the
Bay of Pigs, where Castro’s just few airplanes was able to
devastate the Cuban freedom fighters on the beaches, just a
few aircraft, and that’s all he has, pretty decrepit, also.
They could be knocked out of the air pretty quickly with
American airpower.  HUNT: Should we do that?  SESSIONS: Well, it’s a serious step. I haven’t called
for it. I know Senator Kerry has called for it; Senator
McCain has called for it. Some have said no and expressed
concern. So this is a very delicate situation.  HUNT: Do you think -  (CROSSTALK)  SESSIONS: I’ve been reluctant, since I don’t feel like
I’ve probably studied the intelligence to know whether we
could make a positive difference or not with that.  HUNT: But do you have a sense whether the
administration is responding forcefully enough?  SESSIONS: I don’t think they are. It seems to me
they’re being driven by other events around the whole
Middle Eastern rim, that the French now, Sarkozy is more
aggressive and has a clearer message than President Obama.
He has supported the ouster of Qaddafi, but seems to have
no plan to help the freedom fighters or the rebels to be
successful.  And then but, of course, who are these rebels? And who
really would be the people that took control? These are
complicated issues, there’s no doubt about it.  HUNT: Thank you for talking to us about it. Senator
Sessions, thank you so much for being with us. And when we
come back, we’ll talk to Bloomberg reporters about the
union showdown in Wisconsin and Obama and  oil prices .  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY
