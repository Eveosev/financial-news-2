  Argentina ’s government tightened
limits on vehicle imports as the country’s trade surplus
narrows, newspaper  La Nacion  reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  Industry Minister Debora Giorgi told businessmen in a
meeting yesterday that they will be able to import vehicles
whose value in dollars is equivalent to the value of their
exports, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said. The government
hasn’t lifted a blockade on about 3,000 vehicles that have been
seized by the country’s customs agency, La Nacion said.  The new limits exclude imports from  Mexico  and from the
Mercosur trade bloc, which includes Brazil, Uruguay and  Paraguay , La Nacion said.  -- Editor: Bill Faries  To contact the reporter on this story:
