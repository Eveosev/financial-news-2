  Europe ’s gasoil futures contango,
where fuel for immediate delivery is cheaper than contracts with
later dates, narrowed amid reduced crude and oil-product imports
from Russia and  Libya .  Gasoil for April delivery traded at a discount of $1.50 to
the May contract on the ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 2:46
p.m. London time. That compares with a discount of $2 yesterday
and $3.25 at the beginning of the month and may signal a
shortage of supply or rise in demand.  “In the short term, delays from Russia are acting to
tighten the spreads on the gasoil curve,”  Harry Tchilinguirian ,
London-based head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas
SA, said today in an e-mailed statement. “You also have the
impact of the Libya crisis with the loss of light crude and
eventually reduced yield.”  Russia’s Baltic port of Primorsk, which handles crude oil
and products, is frozen, leaving about a dozen tankers stranded,
a port official said today. Libya is exporting “well below”
500,000 barrels of crude a day, according to the  International
Energy Agency .  Libya produces so-called sweet crude, which means it yields
a higher proportion of diesel, gasoil and gasoline than heavier
grades such as Russia’s Urals and Saudi Arabia’s Arab Medium.
Gasoil is the European equivalent of heating oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
