  Turkey  raised 180 billion yen ($2.2
billion) in the largest sale of Samurai debt by a sovereign
borrower in a decade while paying the same interest costs as
countries with better credit ratings.  Turkey’s 10-year bonds were priced to yield 1.87 percent or
48 basis points more than the benchmark yen swap rate, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread is the same as for
similar-maturity bonds issued by  Panama  in January and 1 basis
point higher than the gap of 47 basis points, or 0.47 percentage
point, for Export-Import Bank of India’s bonds issued last week.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Turkey Ba2, two levels
lower than Panama and  India ’s Exim Bank’s Baa3 ranking.  Turkey’s bond sale is the biggest from any government in
the Japanese market since  Brazil  issued 200 billion yen of two-
year 3.75 percent bonds to individual investors in August 2001,
the data show.  Turkey plans to raise a total of about 12.5 billion liras
($7.9 billion) in foreign borrowing this year, including
payments from international lenders such as the  World Bank . It
sold $1 billion of 30-year bonds on Jan. 5 at a yield of 6.25
percent, the lowest ever for the maturity.  Japan Bank for International Cooperation guaranteed 95
percent of Turkey’s Samurai notes, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. JBIC is ranked Aa2, Moody’s third-highest investment-grade
category. Samurai bonds are yen-denominated notes sold in Japan
by overseas borrowers.  Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co., Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities Co. and Mizuho Securities Co. arranged the
sale.  ---Editors: Gavin Serkin, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
