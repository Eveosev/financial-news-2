The zloty slid for a third day to
its weakest against the euro in three months and Polish stocks
declined after an earthquake in Japan and a Chinese inflation
report curbed investors’ appetite for riskier assets worldwide.  The zloty lost as much as 0.8 percent to 4.0435 per euro,
its weakest intraday level since Dec. 10, and traded 0.5 percent
lower at 2:40 p.m. in Warsaw. The WIG20 gauge of stocks fell 0.4
percent, led by PKO Bank Polski SA and PGE SA.  Stocks in  Europe  and  Asia  fell after a 33 foot-high tsunami
hit Japan, closing airports, suspending bullet train services
and leaving more than 4 million homes without power. Chinese
central bank chief  Zhou Xiaochuan  said today the government of
the world’s fastest-growing major economy will use  interest
rates  to control inflation after the annual price growth was 4.9
percent last month, exceeding forecasts.  “The ongoing flow of negative news should keep the Polish
zloty under pressure today,” Jan Bures, an analyst at KBC Groep
NV’s Prague-based CSOB AS unit, wrote in a report today.
“Markets must cope with a rather serious earthquake in Japan
and the fact that Chinese inflation pressures are not abating.”  The zloty extended its loss so far this week to 1.3 percent
against the euro and 2.9 percent versus the dollar, making it
the world’s second-worst performing currency after the Kenyan
shilling. It has lost 1.7 percent to the euro so far this year.  The quake killed at least 26 people and many are missing,
Japanese state broadcaster NHK Television said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
