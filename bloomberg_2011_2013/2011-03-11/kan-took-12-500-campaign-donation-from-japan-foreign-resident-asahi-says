Japan’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
accepted a donation from a foreign resident in violation of
political contribution laws, the same infraction that forced the
resignation of his foreign minister, the Asahi newspaper said.  Kan received 1.04 million yen ($12,500) from a South Korean
resident of Japan, the newspaper reported today without saying
where it got the information. Kan told his Cabinet this morning
that he wasn’t aware of the nationality of the person who
contributed funds to his office, cabinet ministers said today.  “I don’t think it’s legally problematic as it wasn’t
intentional and he really thought the donor was Japanese,”
Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  told reporters in Tokyo today.  Seiji Maehara stepped down on March 6 as foreign minister
after admitting he accepted 250,000 yen from a South Korean
woman living in Kyoto. His departure was the latest blow to a
government buffeted by finance scandals, diplomatic disputes and
a parliamentary stalemate over authorizing 44.3 trillion yen in  government bonds  to fund the budget and service Japan’s debt.  Opposition lawmakers have previously and repeatedly called
on Kan, whose approval ratings have plummeted, to step down and
call new elections.  To contact the reporters on this story:
