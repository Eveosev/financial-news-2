European Union carbon allowances
for December fell to their lowest in a week, as German power
declined, reducing the incentive to sell forward.  CO2 futures dropped as much as 0.8 percent to 15.65 euros
($21.64) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London and were at 15.72 euros as of 8:34 a.m.  German power for next year dropped 5 cents to 53.10 euros a
megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lower power prices can reduce the incentive for utilities
to sell electricity forward, thereby curbing demand for hedging,
including purchases of carbon futures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
