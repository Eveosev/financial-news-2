The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment in the U.S.
fell to 68.2 in March from 77.5 in February.  The gauge was projected to decline to 76.3, according to
the median estimate of 68 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Estimates ranged from 74 to 80. The index averaged 89 in the
five years leading up the recession that began in December 2007
and ended in June 2009.  A report earlier today from the Commerce Department showed
that retail sales climbed in February by the most in four
months, spurred by job gains and more seasonable temperatures.  The 1 percent increase in purchases followed a revised 0.7
percent rise in January that was more than double the previous
estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
