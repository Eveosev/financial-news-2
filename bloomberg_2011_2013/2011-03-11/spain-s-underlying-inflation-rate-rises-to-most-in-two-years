Spain’s underlying inflation
accelerated in February to the most in more than two years,
highlighting price pressure as the  European Central Bank 
prepares to raise  interest rates .  Core consumer prices, which exclude energy and fresh food,
gained 1.8 percent from a year earlier, the fastest pace since
January 2009, after a 1.6 percent increase the previous month,
the  National Statistics Institute  in Madrid said today. The
headline rate, based on European Union calculations, was 3.4
percent, in line with an initial estimate published on Feb. 28.  Euro-area inflation is already in breach of the ECB’s 2
percent ceiling, accelerating to 2.4 percent in February, the
fastest in more than two years. ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet said March 3 that policy makers may raise the benchmark
rate next month from a record low of 1 percent.  Headline inflation in  Spain , which is slashing wages and
raising taxes in the deepest austerity measures in three
decades, is more than 1 percentage point higher than in  Germany ,
whose economy expanded 3.6 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
