The Federal Trade Commission
accepted a settlement with Internet messaging service Twitter
Inc. to resolve charges that Twitter deceived consumers and put
their privacy at risk by not safeguarding personal information.  The settlement bars Twitter from misleading consumers about
the extent to which it protects the security, privacy and
confidentiality of non-public consumer information for 20 years,
according to a statement posted today on the  FTC website .  Hackers were able to obtain control of Twitter, including
access to non-public user information, messages that consumers
had designated as private, and they had the ability to send out
phony messages from any account, the statement said. The hackers
gained control of Twitter twice between January and May of 2009,
the FTC said.  Twitter must establish and maintain an information security
program which will be assessed by an independent auditor every
other year for 10 years, the statement said. If Twitter violates
the terms of the settlement, it may face civil fines of up to
$16,000 for each violation under the FTC act.  Carolyn Penner, spokeswoman at Twitter, did not immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
