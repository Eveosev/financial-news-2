South African President  Jacob Zuma 
has ordered the Treasury to institute an asset freeze on
transactions linked to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and his
associates, Business Day reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Treasury spokesman Jabulani Sikhakhane said a process is
underway to implement the instruction, declining to comment
further, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  Zuma also tabled a resolution at an African Union meeting
in  Addis Ababa  yesterday to suspend  Libya â€™s membership of the
body, Business Day said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
