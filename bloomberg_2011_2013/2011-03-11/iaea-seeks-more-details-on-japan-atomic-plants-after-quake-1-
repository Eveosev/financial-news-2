The  International Atomic Energy
Agency  is seeking further details on the situation at Fukushima
Daiichi and other nuclear  power plants  in Japan after an
earthquake, the Vienna-based agency said on its website today.  Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, or NISA, said
a heightened state of alert has been declared at Tokyo Electric
Power Co.’s Fukushima Daiichi atomic plant, according to the
IAEA. “NISA says the plant has been shut down and no release of
radiation has been detected,” the IAEA statement said.  Nuclear fuel requires continued cooling even after a plant
is shut down, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
