  Florida  and 25 other states, after
the U.S. appealed a ruling invalidating President Barack Obama’s
health-care law, said they will appeal portions of that decision
and earlier ones in the case that were unfavorable to them.  Lawyers for the states said in a filing yesterday in federal
court in Pensacola, Florida, that their appeal pertains to
“adverse disposition of claims” in Judge C. Roger Vinson’s
Jan. 31 decision and any other adverse rulings in the case. The
U.S. filed a notice of appeal on March 8.  Vinson ruled that Congress had exceeded its power to
regulate commerce, and he declared the entire law invalid. A
provision requiring Americans over 18 to obtain insurance
coverage violated the U.S Constitution, according to the judge,
who was the second federal judge to rule against the law.  Obama signed the legislation on March 23, 2010. That same
day, lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the measure
were filed by the attorneys general of Florida and  Virginia . The
Florida case, begun by then-Attorney General  Bill McCollum , was
joined by 25 other states.  The appellate case is State of Florida v. United States
Department of Health and Human Services, 11-11021,  U.S. Court of
Appeals  for the 11th Circuit (Atlanta). The lower-court case is
State of Florida v. U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 10-cv-00091, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Florida (Pensacola).  To contact the reporter on this story:
