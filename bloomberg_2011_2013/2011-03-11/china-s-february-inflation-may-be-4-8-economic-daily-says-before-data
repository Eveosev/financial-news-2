  China ’s consumer prices may have
risen 4.8 percent in February from a year earlier, the Economic
Information Daily reported, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the situation.  That would match the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 22 economists. The National Bureau of Statistics is to
release the number along with other indicators at 10 a.m. in
Beijing today.  Inflation climbed to 4.9 percent in January from 4.6
percent in December, breaching the government’s target of 4
percent for this year.  The country’s producer prices may have increased 6.7
percent last month from a year earlier, the newspaper said. That
compares with the median estimate for a 7 percent gain in a
Bloomberg News survey.  China may keep consumer-price gains within 4.5 percent this
month, the newspaper said, citing the unidentified person.  Ma Jiantang, head of the National Bureau of Statistics,
said on March 10 he’s “confident” of achieving the
government’s 4 percent target for inflation. Ma said the nation
needs prudent monetary policy to help curb consumer-price growth.  --Zheng Lifei. Editors: Sunil Jagtiani, Linus Chua  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
