Ukraine, the world’s largest barley
exporter in the year that ended in September, may scrap quotas
on outbound grain shipments after March 31 and replace them with
a duty, UkrAgroConsult said.  The Kiev-based researcher cited unidentified people in the
presidential administration. Regulating exports with a duty “is
more transparent and arouses no question about non-equal
access,” it said in an e-mailed statement today.  Ukraine’s government introduced the quotas in October in an
effort to curb local grain and food prices. The current limits
of 4.2 million metric tons of wheat, barley and corn are in
force through March. Ukraine exported 7.2 million tons of grain
between July 1 and the middle of February, research company
UkrAgroConsult in Kiev said last month.  The corn and wheat quotas may be increased after the end of
March following a review of national grain stockpiles,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said Feb. 22. A
decision on the curbs is due in the middle of March, according
to the minister.  Ukraine exported 5.75 million tons of barley in the year
through September, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture .  To contact the reporter on this story:
