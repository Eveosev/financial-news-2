  Colombia ’s Pacific coast, including
Buenaventura, the country’s biggest port, is on alert after an
8.9-magnitude earthquake in Japan triggered a tsunami warning.  Waves generated by the quake may reach Colombia at 7 p.m.
New York time, the nation’s disaster prevention agency said in a
 statement  on its website. Available information so far signals
no waves with “dangerous heights” will reach Colombia,
according to the statement.  “We lament the tragedy in Japan,” President  Juan Manuel
Santos  said in a Twitter message posted on the presidency’s
 website . The government “will be informing of the effects on
our Pacific coast,” Santos wrote.  Classes have been canceled in the town of Tumaco in
Colombia’s Pacific coast near the border with  Ecuador , according
to Bogota-based RCN Radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
