  China  will harvest 162 million
metric tons of corn in the marketing year that began Oct. 1, up
from 152 million tons a year earlier, according to a unit of
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . The official USDA estimate
released this week was 168 million tons.  Production may rise to 163 million tons in the next
marketing year, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service said
today in a  report  on its website.  The estimates for the current and previous years are lower
than official Chinese government figures based partly on
provincial government data, “which can be inflated,”
according to the report. Officials from the provinces “may be
tempted to overstate” production to receive higher payments
from the central government, it said.  China’s corn imports will rise to 1.5 million metric tons
in the marketing year that ends Sept. 30, up from 1.269 million
in the previous year, the USDA unit said. Imports may rise to
2.5 million in the next season on increasing demand for  animal
feed , according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
