Moody’s Investors Service said it
cut the ratings of the Spanish regional administrations of
Castilla-La Mancha, Catalunya, Murcia and Valencia on concern
over their fiscal deficits.  “Today’s downgrades reflect the wide deviations registered
by these regions from the deficit limits set for 2010 and the
subsequent difficulties Moody’s anticipates they will encounter
in controlling their deficit and debt trajectories in 2011-12,”
the ratings company said today in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
