Natural gas futures may fall on
forecasts of moderating temperatures that would limit demand for
the heating fuel, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Eight of 17 analysts, or 47 percent, forecast that gas
futures will drop on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through
March 18. Six, or 35 percent, said futures will rise and three
predicted that prices will stay the same. Last week, 38 percent
of participants said gas prices would advance.  Temperatures will be above normal from March 15 to March 19
across much of the country, according to the  National Weather
Service .  A seasonal first-quarter decline “has been with us for the
last 30 days or so, and the market’s pretty well supported at
$3.65,” said Brian Habacivch, senior vice president for
research and publications at Fellon-McCord in Louisville,  Kentucky . “I think the market’s going to find a near-term
bottom.”  Natural gas for April delivery gained 8 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $3.889 per million British thermal units this week
on the  New York  exchange.  The high in New York on March 17 will be 59 degrees
Fahrenheit (8 Celsius), 9 degrees above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. The high in  Chicago  may be 50, 2 degrees above normal.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 48 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  6     8         3  To contact the reporter on this story:
