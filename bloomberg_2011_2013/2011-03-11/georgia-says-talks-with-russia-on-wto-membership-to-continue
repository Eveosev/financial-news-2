  Georgia  may resume talks next month
on lifting its opposition to  Russia ’s bid to join the  World
Trade Organization .  The two sides made no “significant” progress during
negotiations in Switzerland earlier this week, Nikoloz
Mchedlishvili, a spokesman for Prime Minister Nika Gilauri, said
by telephone in the capital Tbilisi today.  Mchedlishvili said Georgia’s opposition isn’t related to
Russia’s five-year-old trade embargo against the Black Sea
country, and that returning to the Russian market “isn’t a huge
priority.” Georgia objects to customs checkpoints in the
breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, he said.  Russia routed Georgia’s army in an August 2008 war over
South Ossetia, then recognized it and Abkhazia as independent
countries. Georgia maintains that Russia occupied the regions
after the conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
