  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) ,  KDDI Corp. (9433)  and  Softbank Corp. (9984) , the three largest mobile-phone operators in
Japan, said their services were disrupted across many regions
after an earthquake shook buildings across the nation.  Wireless connections are poor across the country, Atsuko
Suzuki, a spokeswoman for NTT DoCoMo said by phone. Phone
services across Tohoku, Kanto and Tokai regions were bad,
Softbank spokeswoman Makiko Ariyama said separately. Softbank is
checking for possible damages to its telecommunications
facilities, she said.  An 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of
northern Japan, shaking buildings violently in Tokyo, according
to the U.S. Geological Service. A tsunami of more than 10 meters
was reported in northern Japan.  The quake struck at 2:46 p.m. local time 130 kilometers (81
miles) off the coast of Sendai north of Tokyo, at a depth of 24
kilometers, USGS said. The  Japan Meteorological Agency  issued
its highest tsunami warning for the countryâ€™s northeast coast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
