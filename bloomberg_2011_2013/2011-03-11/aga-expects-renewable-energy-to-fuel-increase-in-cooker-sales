  Aga Rangemaster Group Plc (AGA) , which
makes cast-iron cookers, is looking to alternative energies such
as solar power and bio-oil to fuel sales growth, Chief Executive
Officer William McGrath said.  “It could easily be that in five or 10 years, having
energy products sourced locally will become mainstream,”
McGrath said in a telephone interview today. “We are alive to
evolving technology and ensuring people have got as many options
as possible.”  The rising price of oil is prompting customers buying Aga
and Rangemaster cookers to switch to programmable electric
ovens, from traditional oil-fired and solid-fuel products.
Electric cookers now account for 60 percent of sales.  Aga and Rangemaster sales both rose last year, with revenue
rising 5.8 percent. Customers will pay higher prices only if
they get increased functionality, McGrath said.  “We expect similar trend lines in 2011, in spite of the
clouds over consumer markets,” McGrath said. “Our base
position is to assume that the housing market will be flat.”  Net income rose to 15 million pounds ($24 million), or 21.7
pence a share, from 1.7 million pounds, or 2.5 pence, in 2009,
the Leamington Spa, central England-based company said in a
PRNewswire statement today. Revenue rose to 259.1 million pounds
from 245 million. Operating profit was 5.1 million pounds,
compared with a loss of 1.5 million in 2009.  The shares rose as much as 8.2 percent, the most in more
than seven weeks, and were 6 pence, or 4.9 percent, higher at
128 pence at 9:44 a.m. in London trading.  Exports account for 37 percent of the business, McGrath
said.  France  is its fastest-selling market and the biggest
outside the U.K., he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
