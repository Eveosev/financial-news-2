Asia gasoil’s crack spread
increased for the first time in three days on speculation
exports from Japan will be reduced following the biggest
earthquake in a century. Hin Leong Trading Pte purchased cargoes
in  Singapore .  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude gained 5
cents to $19.77 a barrel at 7 p.m. Singapore time, according to
PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure of
refining profit, ended a two-day drop.  Gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur, declined $1.95, or 1.5
percent, this week to $129.30 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. This ended a nine-week rising streak, the
longest rally since July 1991. Jet fuel fell $2.25, or 1.7
percent, from last week to $130.70.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rebounded 15 cents to 95
cents, after falling for four days, PVM said. This regrade
yesterday was at the narrowest since Oct. 8, indicating it’s
less profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  In Singapore, Hin Leong bought 150,000 barrels of 0.5
percent sulfur gasoil from Shell at 10 cents a barrel below
benchmark quotes, traders said. Hin Leong yesterday sold two
cargoes at a discount of 20 cents.  Light Distillates  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline dropped $2.60, or 2.1 percent,
this week to $118.65 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.
Open-specification naphtha for delivery to Japan fell $35.75, or
3.5 percent, from last week to $983.25 a metric ton. Each
product posted the first weekly drop in a month.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha climbed to $11.10 a barrel,
from $9.70 at the end of last week, Bloomberg data showed. A
widening reforming margin means it’s profitable to turn naphtha
into motor fuel.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to  Brent crude 
traded in  London  decreased to $124.15 a ton, 15 percent down
from last week, based on Bloomberg data. A narrowing crack
spread signals eroding profit from making the petrochemical
feedstock.  Shell, the biggest buyer of 97-RON gasoline in Singapore,
purchased 50,000 barrels from Glencore International AG at
$121.90 a barrel, traders said. Shell yesterday bought from
PetroChina Co.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil gained $1 this week to
$649.50 a ton, capping a seven-week climb, according to
Bloomberg data. The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly
used as marine fuel, dropped $2 from last week to $634.50, the
first weekly decline in 10 weeks.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or the crack spread,
narrowed for a fourth day to $8.08 a barrel, Bloomberg data
showed. This indicates losses from turning oil into residual
products were the smallest since March 1.  The premium of the 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-
centistoke grade increased for a third day to $15 a ton, based
on Bloomberg calculations. A widening viscosity spread means
marine fuel is falling faster than higher-quality fuel oil.  In Singapore, Hin Leong bought two 20,000-ton cargoes of
180-centistoke fuel oil from Cargill Inc., paying $1.50 and $2 a
ton over March quotes, traders said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
