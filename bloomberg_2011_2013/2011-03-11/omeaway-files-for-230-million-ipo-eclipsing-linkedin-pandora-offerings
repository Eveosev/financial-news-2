HomeAway Inc. , a vacation-rental
website, filed to sell as much as $230 million worth of shares
in an initial public offering, joining a resurgence in dot-com
companies going public.    Morgan Stanley (MS)  will lead the IPO, HomeAway said today in a
regulatory filing. The company, which will trade under the
ticker “AWAY,” also is working with  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   HomeAway, a six-year-old company based in Austin,  Texas ,
runs the largest online marketplace for vacation rentals. The
company, facing mounting competition from sites such as  Airbnb
Inc. , says it may use some of the IPO proceeds to acquire
businesses and add product lines. HomeAway’s IPO is larger than
the pending deals of two other Internet companies: LinkedIn
Corp. and Pandora Media Inc.  “This is certainly one of the larger venture-backed IPOs
to have filed in quite some time,” said  Lise Buyer , principal
of Class V Group, an IPO advisory firm in Palo Alto, California.
“There’s clearly an appetite in the marketplace for solid new
growth stories.”  HomeAway’s sales climbed 40 percent to $167.9 million last
year, according to the filing. That helped the company narrow
its net loss to $18.3 million, or 48 cents a share, from $25.8
million, or 70 cents, in 2009.  Rental Listings  HomeAway has more than 540,000 rental listings in 120
countries, according to its website. Homeowners pay an annual
fee of about $300 to list, and the site is free for renters. In
addition to HomeAway.com, the company runs Vacation Rentals by
Owner, or  VRBO.com , and VacationRentals.com.  HomeAway raised about $500 million in private capital from
 Austin Ventures , also based in Austin, and Redpoint Ventures in
Menlo Park,  California , which first invested in HomeAway in
2005. Redpoint, along with Palo Alto, California-based
Technology Crossover Ventures and Institutional Venture
Partners, invested  $250 million  in 2008.  Last year, HomeAway bought Escapia Inc. and Instant
Software Inc., providers of software for vacation rentals, which
together represent almost 1,700 property-management customers,
HomeAway said in October.  The IPO is likely to happen by June, two people familiar
with the matter said last month. Pandora, an Internet-radio
company, announced plans in February to raise $100 million in an
IPO. LinkedIn, a business networking site, filed for an IPO in
January that would raise as much as $175 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
