OAO TransCreditBank rallied by the
most in three months after Vedomosti reported VTB Group will pay
a higher price to acquire an additional stake in the bank,
citing three sources close to the board.  The lending arm of OAO Russian Railways jumped 3.4 percent
to 20.49 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close of trading in Moscow, its
biggest gain since Dec. 3.  VTB will pay 2.5 billion rubles ($87.1 million) more than
it did during the initial stage of the phased transaction,
announced in October 2010, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
