The  Asian Development Bank  agreed
to lend  Vietnam  $540 million for the construction of a subway
line to reduce traffic congestion in  Ho Chi Minh City , according
to a statement from the lender released in Hanoi today.  Total investment for the project is about $1.37 billion,
according to a separate government statement handed out at the
signing ceremony today. Construction will start in 2012 and a
test run is planned for 2016, the statement said.  “We are fully aware that the real challenge is to change
the people’s mindset,” Ayumi Konishi, the ADB’s country
director for Vietnam said. “We sincerely hope public
transportation will be supported by people in Ho Chi Minh City
as improved and cheaper transport will create business
opportunities, reduce congestion, and improve the quality of
life.”  The  European Investment Bank  will provide 150 million euros
($206 million) for the project, according to the government
statement today.  Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau,  Germany ’s state-owned
development bank, earlier this month agreed to give Vietnam 10
million euros in aid and 18 million euros in loans for the
project, as part of the German government’s plan to provide
Vietnam with 85.75 million euros in non-refundable aid and 155
million euros in loans to help finance the construction of the
subway line.  The 19-kilometer (12 miles) subway, Ho Chi Minh City’s
second line, is part of wider efforts to curb traffic jams in
the city caused by inefficient public transport and increasing
use of private vehicles. The  city government  plans to build a
$7.5 billion metropolitan rail system by 2020, with 84 percent
of the funds expected to come from overseas lenders.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
