All members of a union representing  Kenya  Power & Lighting Co. workers may join a strike that began
this week in the port city of  Mombasa , the  Daily Nation  said,
citing the union’s secretary-general, Ernest Nadome.  A work stoppage by about 200 contract and temporary workers
for Kenya’s sole power distributor, who are in a dispute over
working conditions, has delayed repairs to electricity
infrastructure and caused power disruptions in the Mombasa area,
the Nairobi-based newspaper reported today.  Kenya Power spokesman Migwi Theuri didn’t answer his mobile
phone when Bloomberg News called seeking comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
