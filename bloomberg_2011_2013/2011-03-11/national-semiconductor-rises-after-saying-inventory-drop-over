  National Semiconductor Corp. (NSM) , a
maker of chips that control power in electronic devices, rallied
after saying its distributors are building inventory and fiscal
third-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates.  Profit excluding some items of 26 cents a share beat the
average analyst estimate of 24 cents, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Distributors of chips from  Santa Clara , California-based
National Semiconductor chips had reduced inventory in
anticipation of slow demand from their customers. Orders in the
current quarter will  rise from the previous three months after
the inventory correction “turned the corner,” Chief Financial
Officer Lewis Chew said in a conference call yesterday after the
market closed.  “National’s commentary on a steady increase in orders over
the past three months is the latest proof point that the
inventory correction is almost over,” JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Christopher Danely, a San Francisco-based analyst, wrote in a
note to clients. Danely last week boosted his view on the
industry to “constructive” from “cautious.”  Shares of National Semiconductor added 3.2 percent to
$14.61 as of 12:49 p.m. in  New York . The stock rose as much as
5.3 percent, the most intraday since June 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
