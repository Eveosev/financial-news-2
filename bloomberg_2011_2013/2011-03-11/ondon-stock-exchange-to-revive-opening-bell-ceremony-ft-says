The  London  Stock Exchange, which
closed its trading pits in 1986, when it went over to electronic
trading, is reviving the ritual of the opening bell, the
Financial Times reported.  Construction work begins today on a facility at the
exchange’s headquarters near St Paul’s Cathedral that’s likely
to feature an electronic bell and flashing ticker screens in its
lobby, the newspaper said.  The revival of the ceremony would be a marketing device
that would help to differentiate the U.K. capital’s traditional
exchange from rivals such as Chi-X  Europe  and BATS Europe that
now have about 45 percent of trading in stocks on the benchmark
FTSE 100 index, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
