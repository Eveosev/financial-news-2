Russian stocks declined for a third
day as oil, the country’s main export revenue earner, tumbled
after an earthquake struck off the coast of Japan. HSBC Holdings
Plc cut the nation’s shares to “neutral” from “overweight.”  The Micex Index dropped 0.7 percent to 1,719.95 by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow. Oil producer OAO Gazprom Neft tumbled 3.3
percent. OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest lender, dropped 0.9
percent after announcing a deal to acquire the Troika Dialog
investment bank. OAO Novatek, the country’s second-largest
natural gas producer, lost 2.7 percent. The dollar-denominated
RTS Index slipped 1 percent to 1,929.59.  Oil headed for the first weekly decline in a month,
following an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the northern coast of
Japan. Crude for April delivery slumped as much as $3.69, or 3.6
percent, to $99.01 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Protests are scheduled today in Saudi
Arabia, the Middle East’s biggest producer of crude.  “The earthquake in Japan along with the events in the
Middle East has caused some selling,” Ovanes Oganisian, a
strategist at  Renaissance Capital , said by phone today.  Copper for three-month delivery fell 1.5 percent to $9,053
a metric ton on the London Metals Exchange. Nickel, lead, tin
and zinc all declined on the LME. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel,
Russia’s biggest mining company, decreased 1.6 percent to 6,769
rubles.  OAO Raspadskaya, a coal producer, dropped to its lowest
close since Nov. 30, losing 3.5 percent to 192.4 rubles. The
stock declined 6.3 percent yesterday after two people familiar
with the matter said that Russian billionaire  Roman Abramovich 
and his partners in steelmaker Evraz Group SA are seeking to
sell their stake.  HSBC Cuts Russia  HSBC reduced its rating for Russia because  oil prices  may
fall after  Saudi Arabia  promised to increase production to
compensate for reductions caused by unrest in  Libya .  “Oill prices should fall back gradually to where they were
before the current Middle-Eastern crisis erupted,” John Lomax
and Wietse Nijenhuis wrote in the report e-mailed today. This
will be “negative” for Russia, they said.  Russia’s Micex Index fell the most in a month yesterday,
declining 2.7 percent to 1,731.80 in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
