Crude oil fell, capping the first
weekly drop in a month, after Japan’s strongest earthquake on
record shut refineries and dissidents in  Saudi Arabia  failed to
stage planned protests.  The 8.9-magnitude temblor unleashed a 7-meter (23-foot)
tsunami that killed hundreds of people in Japan, the world’s
third-largest oil-consuming country. Saudi Arabian police and
anti-riot vehicles patrolled central  Riyadh  today, preventing a
“Day of Rage” proclaimed by activists.  “This is in response to the tsunami and the lack of the
Day of Rage in Saudi Arabia,” said  Hamza Khan , an analyst at
the Schork Group Inc., a consulting company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “If the Japanese refineries are down, then we’re
going to see lower demand for crude oil.”  In other markets, grains after Japan, a major importer of
U.S. crops, was struck by the quake, threatening to curb demand.
Cocoa also dropped. The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity
Commodity Index fell 0.7 percent to 1,723.48, This week, the
gauge declined 3.9 percent, the most since May. The measure was
down for the fifth straight day, the longest slump since August.  Oil futures for April delivery tumbled $1.54, or 1.5
percent, to $101.16 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since March 1. The price
declined 3.1 percent this week.  Futures still have gained 21 percent since Oct 1. A civil
war in  Libya , a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Countries, and turmoil in northern  Africa  and the Middle East
has roiled markets. President  Barack Obama  said today that he is
prepared to release oil the U.S.  Strategic Petroleum Reserve  if
fuel supplies tighten and cost jump.  Corn, Wheat  Corn futures for May delivery fell 18.5 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $6.6425 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price touched $6.5275, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Jan. 31.  Japan, the largest buyer of U.S. corn, is checking ports
and grain depots for damage after a tsunami that engulfed towns
on the northern coast, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries said. Farmland was flooded with burning debris in some
areas as the tidal surge swept inland, images from state
broadcaster NHK showed.  The quake “will likely impact grain trade” after ports in
Kushiro, Hachinohe, Ishinomaki and Kashima were hit by the
tsunami, and some feed mills and livestock operations were hurt,
the U.S. Grains Council said.  ‘Economic Shock’  “There is no way to assess even the direct damage to
Japan’s economy, or to the global economy,” Carl B. Weinberg,
the chief economist at Valhalla, New York-based High Frequency
Economics Ltd., said in a note to clients. “Experience tells us
that the economic shock can be, and likely will be, much bigger
than anyone can imagine.”  Japan is the second-biggest buyer of U.S. wheat and rice
and ranks third for soybeans, government data show. Last month,
grain prices surged to the highest since 2008 as rising demand
and adverse weather cut inventories.  Wheat futures for May delivery dropped 21.75 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $7.1875 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched
$7.0375, the lowest since Dec. 1. This week, the grain plunged
14 percent, the most since December 2008.  Soybean futures for May delivery dropped 21 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $13.345 a bushel. This week, the price fell 5.6
percent, the most since October.  Rice futures for May delivery fell 4 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $13.01 per 100 pounds. Earlier, the price touched $12.48, the
lowest since Oct. 6. This week, the commodity tumbled 8.3
percent, the most since January 2009.  Cocoa  Cocoa fell, capping the biggest weekly drop since May, on
speculation that supplies from  Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest
exporter, will increase after the government threatened to seize
undeclared inventories.  Ivorian exporters have until March 31 to ship bean
stockpiles or face “sanctions,” a spokesman for President  Laurent Gbagbo  said March 9. Gbagbo has refused to step down
following a November election that international observers say
was won by  Alassane Ouattara , who has asked shippers to hold
back exports to deny funds to his rival.  “The market is realizing there is still a lot of supply,
as the situation in Ivory Coast is forcing suppliers to export
in order to pay the domestic tax,” said Jonathan Bouchet, an
analyst at OTCex Group, a broker in Geneva.  Cocoa for May delivery fell $33, or 1 percent, to $3,412 a
metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Prices dropped 6.7
percent this week, the most since May 14.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
