The  New York City  Police Department
and a dozen regional partners will conduct a full-scale exercise
early next month to test their ability to detect and intercept
radioactive materials that could be used in a terrorist attack.  The exercise will be held from April 5 to April 9 and will
involve 150 agencies, including law enforcement and first
responders, working in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,  Paul Browne , a department spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement.  The exercise is part of the Securing the Cities initiative
funded by the U.S. Homeland Security Department, which works to
prevent terrorists from infiltrating a major city with a so-
called dirty bomb or nuclear device, Browne said.  “The public can expect to observe increased  law
enforcement  activity throughout the tri-state region in the form
of traffic checkpoints and grid searches,” Commissioner  Raymond Kelly  said in the statement. “In particular, increased activity
may be observed on roadways and transit hubs leading into New
York City and may result in traffic delays in off-peak hours.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
