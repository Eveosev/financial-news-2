Nicholas Levene, the London-based
financier who was charged with fraud, lost 25 million pounds
($40 million) of investors’ money, prosecutors said.  Levene, 46, the former deputy chairman of both Nicola Horlick’s Bramdean Asset Management LLP and Leyton Orient
Football Club, had obtained 30 million pounds from investors,
U.K. Serious Fraud Office lawyer Jonathan Midgley told the City
of  London  Magistrate’s Court today.  The financier was charged by the SFO last week with fraud,
forgery,  money laundering  and false accounting, following a 15-
week investigation.  Levene, who was formerly an  investment adviser  at
Integrated Financial Products Ltd. according to the Financial
Services Authority’s register, appeared at court today and
wasn’t required to enter a plea. He has been released on bail.  Levene’s lawyer didn’t make a comment to the court. Levene
declined to comment after the hearing.  The FSA register also listed Levene as chief executive of
Duet Private Equity Ltd. in 2002 and 2003. Duet said that Levene
was never an employee of the company and that he had only been
an employee of Investory Ltd., which Duet acquired in 2005.  “Nick Levene was never CEO or an employee of Duet Private
Equity Limited,” Duet spokesman William Clutterbuck said in an
e-mailed statement. “Duet Group acquired Investory Limited in
2005 and changed the name to Duet Private Equity Limited.”  The case was adjourned for 12 weeks and Levene was ordered
to remain at his current address in Hertfordshire,  England , and
not leave the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
