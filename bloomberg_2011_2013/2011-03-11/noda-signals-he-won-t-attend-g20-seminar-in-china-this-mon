Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  indicated he won’t join a meeting of Group of 20 finance
chiefs scheduled for March 31 in Nanjing,  China .  “I wish I could go but it’s difficult for me to attend as
it’s the end of the fiscal year here,” Noda told reporters in
Tokyo today, signaling his focus is on passing the budget and
other bills this month. Rintaro Tamaki, vice finance minister
for international affairs, will be at the meeting, Noda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
