Russian billionaire  Vladimir Potanin ’s Interros Holding Co. said it would support  Alexander Voloshin ’s return as chairman of OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel should
the United Co. Rusal-backed candidate be elected to the board.  Shareholders of Norilsk voted for a new board today amid a
dispute over management between Interros and Rusal, which hold
about 30 percent and 25 percent of  Russia ’s largest mining
company, respectively.  Interros will support Voloshin as chairman should he win
enough votes to join the board, Larisa Zelkova, an Interros
candidate for the Norilsk board, said by phone today.  Norilsk said shareholders representing 93.5 percent of the
company participated in today’s vote, the results of which may
not be made public until next week.  “Rusal gave some of its votes for Voloshin and we hope
that he will be in the board,” Maxim Sokov, Rusal’s director of
strategy, said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
