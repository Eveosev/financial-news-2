  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  seeks to grow
organically rather than through acquisitions and its
headquarters will remain in  Stockholm , Svenska Dagbladet
Naeringsliv reported, citing retiring Chairman Hans Dalborg.  Dalborg, who is stepping down at the annual shareholders’
meeting on March 24, doesn’t foresee any big deals in the
Swedish banking industry in the near future, the newspaper
quoted him as saying. He said Nordea’s growth will come from
measures such as opening new offices in the fast-growing Polish
market, SvD Naeringsliv reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
