  Sony Corp. (6758)  plans to resume
shipments of PlayStation 3 game consoles in the Netherlands
after the Dutch authorities lifted an injunction issued on a
patent-infringement complaint lodged by  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)   A preliminary order was released after a court hearing
yesterday, Yasuhiro Okaka, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Sony,
said by phone today. Ken Hong, a spokesman for Seoul-based LG,
declined to comment, citing the company’s policy not to speak on
pending legal matters.  Sony’s game consoles were seized late last month amid a
widening legal feud between the Asian electronics makers, who
compete against each other in televisions and mobile phones. The
two companies are in a patent-infringement battle in the U.S.
over technology used in mobile phones and televisions.  Sony dropped 1.9 percent to 2,816 yen as of 10:55 a.m. in
Tokyo trading. LG fell 0.9 percent to 106,500 won in  Seoul .  To contact the reporter on this story:
