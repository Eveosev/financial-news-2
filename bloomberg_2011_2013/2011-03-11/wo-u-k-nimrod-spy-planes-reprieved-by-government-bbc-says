The U.K. reprieved two BAe Nimrod
spy planes due to have been axed at the end of March as part of
the coalition governmentâ€™s spending cuts, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  The Nimrods, the R1 version, are currently on assignment in
the Middle East and their crews have been told they will
continue operating until at least the end of June; the Ministry
of Defence declined to say if the decision was linked to
planning for a no-fly zone over  Libya , the state-funded
broadcaster said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
