  India ’s 11-year bonds headed for a
fifth weekly gain as the government refrained from selling debt,
spurring demand for fixed-income securities.  A commerce ministry report showed yesterday the rate of
food inflation slowed to a three-month low in the week ended Feb.
26. The last bond auction was on Feb. 11, which was part of the
government’s 4.57 trillion rupees ($101 billion) target for the
fiscal year ending this month. The government has raised 4.37
trillion rupees in the period.  “Bonds have advanced as the lack of supply encouraged some
buying in the secondary market,” said A.Y. Shedshale, a Mumbai-
based deputy general manager at Bank of Maharashtra. “Food
inflation also seems to be slowing, which is positive for
returns.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022
declined two basis points this week to 8.05 percent as of 9:24
a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.
The rate rose one basis point today. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products, including lentils, rice and vegetables, climbed 9.5
percent in the week ended Feb. 26 from a year earlier, the
government said in a statement yesterday. The gauge showed a
10.4 percent increase the previous week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
