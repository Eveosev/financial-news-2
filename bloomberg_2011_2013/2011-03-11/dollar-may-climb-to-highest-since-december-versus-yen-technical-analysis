The dollar may climb to the highest
level against the yen since December within a month after the
U.S. currency rose above its 90-day moving average, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  The dollar may gain 1.9 percent to reach the Dec. 15 high
of 84.51 yen after the currency breached initial resistance
yesterday and its 5-, 21- and 65-day moving averages are about
to form so-called golden crosses, said Teppei Ino, a Tokyo-based
analyst at the unit of Japan’s largest banking group. Resistance
refers to a level where sell orders may be clustered.  “The upper 83 yen level came into sight after the dollar
closed above the 90-day line yesterday,” Ino said in a phone
interview today. “If the moving averages line up in ascending
order, that suggests a bullish signal. Conditions for the
greenback are improving.”  The dollar strengthened to as much as 83.02 yen before
trading at 82.92 yen as of 9:47 a.m. in Tokyo from 82.98 yen in  New York  yesterday, when it touched 83.17, the strongest since
Feb. 22. The “upper 83 yen level” is on a trend line
connecting the highs of 84.51 yen on Dec. 15 and 83.98 yen on
Feb. 16, Ino said.  “The dollar may next target the December high by about the
beginning of April,” the analyst said.  The level of 84.51 is a 76.4 percent retracement of the
currency’s drop from a Sept. 16 high of 85.93 to a Nov. 1 low of
80.22 yen, based on the Fibonacci sequence, according to Ino.  A golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average
passes above a longer-term line. Fibonacci analysis is based on
the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  -- Editors: Jonathan Annells, Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporter on this story:
