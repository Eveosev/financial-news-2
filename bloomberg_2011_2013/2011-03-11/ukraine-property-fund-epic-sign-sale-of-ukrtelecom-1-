Epic Financial Consulting
Gesellschaft , a private-equity group, signed an agreement with
the Ukrainian Property Fund to buy a 92.79 percent stake in VAT  Ukrtelecom (UTLM)  for 10.575 billion hryvnia ($1.3 billion) in Kiev
today.  “The money will be in the state budget in 60 days from
now,” Oleksandr Ryabchenko, who heads the fund, said after the
signing of the agreement with Epic Services. “There are no
other options.”  Ukraine’s sale of Ukrtelecom will be the largest state
asset disposal since 2005, when the country’s biggest steel mill
was sold to  ArcelorMittal (MT)  for $4.8 billion. Ukrtelecom’s sale
has been delayed since 1998 because of disputes between state
agencies.  Vienna-based Epic, which deposited 1 billion hryvnia when
bidding for Ukrtelecom last year, will pay the remaining 9.58
billion hryvnia in two equal parts, Ryabchenko said.  Ukrtelecom is the biggest provider of fixed phones in
Ukraine and operates more than 10 million telephone lines, Epic
said in an e-mailed press statement today. It is also a leading
provider of Internet services, according to the statement.  The company has outstanding debt of $160 million and 3.7
billion hryvnia, according to the State Property Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
