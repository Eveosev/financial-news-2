Corn and soybeans fell on
speculation that investment demand for raw materials will
decline and global growth will slow will after Japan was hit by
the biggest earthquake in at least a century.  The  Bank of Japan  pledged to ensure financial stability
after hundreds were killed in the 8.9-magnitude quake that
triggered a tsunami which flooded farmland and towns on the
country’s northern coast. The nation is the biggest importer of
U.S. corn and third-biggest buyer of soybeans.  “Uncertainty encourages traders to reduce risk and cut
positions,” said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading
Inc. in Fowler,  Indiana . “It’s way too early to say what the
impact will be on the global economy or grain demand.”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 14.75 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $6.68 a bushel at 10:07 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. A close at that level would leave the price down 8.2
percent for the week, the most since Nov. 12. Earlier, the
commodity touched $6.5275, the lowest since January 31. The
most-active contract reached a 31-month high on Feb. 22 of
$7.4425.  Soybean futures for May delivery dropped 18 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $13.375 a bushel, leaving the price down 5.4 for
the week. That would be the biggest weekly drop since Oct. 1.
The most-active contract reached a 30-month high of $14.5575 on
Feb. 9 on record Chinese demand for U.S. supplies.  Japan’s earthquake is unlikely to cause significant damage
to the nation’s feed and food production, said Nobuyuki Chino,
the president of Tokyo-based Unipac Grain Ltd.  There are no large-scale facilities to produce livestock
feed and wheat flour in the northern prefecture of Miyagi,
which was hardest hit by the temblor, said Chino, who has
traded grains for three decades. Factories in the region are
supplied with grain unloaded at five or six local ports that
are too small to accept Panamax-size vessels, he said today by
telephone.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
