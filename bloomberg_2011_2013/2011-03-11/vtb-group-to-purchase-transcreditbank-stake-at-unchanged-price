VTB Group,  Russia ’s second-biggest
bank, expects to boost its stake in OAO TransCreditBank to 75
percent in the coming months at the same price it agreed to last
year, according to Deputy Chairman  Herbert Moos .  The Moscow-based bank will buy the stake for a maximum of
2.2 times TransCreditBank’s capital at the end of 2010, which is
“unchanged” from what it agreed to pay last year, Moos told
reporters on a conference call today. Vedomosti reported today
that VTB will pay a higher price to acquire the stake in the
lending unit of OAO Russian Railways, pushing TransCreditBank’s
shares higher by as much as 4.8 percent.  Russian Railways agreed to sell a stake of about 30 percent
in TransCreditBank to VTB and wants to maintain a blocking stake
in the lender, the rail monopoly’s Chief Executive Officer
Vladimir Yakunin told reporters Feb. 9. VTB expects to complete
the sale “in the next few months,” Moos said today.  VTB traded down 0.6 percent at 9.392 kopeks by 4:39 p.m. in
Moscow, paring an earlier loss of as much as 3.1 percent.
TransCreditBank shares were 3.5 percent higher at 20.495 rubles,
trimming a jump of 4.8 percent earlier, their biggest intraday
advance this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
