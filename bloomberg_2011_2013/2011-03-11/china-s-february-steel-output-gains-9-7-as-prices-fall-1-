  China , the world’s biggest steel
producer, boosted output by 9.7 percent last month from a year
ago as prices decline.  Crude steel production rose to 54.3 million metric tons in
February from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said
today in a statement. Output in the first two months increased
13 percent to 114.2 million tons, the bureau said, indicating
January output was 59.9 million tons, a record high.  Prices have fallen from a two-and-a-half-year high reached
last month as mills ramped up production. The government figures
indicate daily steel output was 1.94 million tons in February,
higher than 1.93 million tons in January.  “It’s definitely negative news for the steel market,”
said Hu Yanping, a Beijing-based analyst with UC361.com.
“Supply is rising faster than our expectation. There’s pressure
on the prices to fall further.”  Domestic prices of hot-rolled steel, a benchmark, fell to
4,654 yuan ($708) a ton yesterday after reaching 4,961 yuan on
Feb. 15, the highest since Sept. 2008, according to researcher
Beijing Antaike  Information Technology  Co.  Overcapacity and rising costs reduced the average profit
margins of Chinese steelmakers to just 3.5 percent in 2010, the
lowest of any industry, according to the Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
