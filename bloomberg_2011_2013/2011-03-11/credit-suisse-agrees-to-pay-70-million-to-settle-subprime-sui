  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s second biggest bank, agreed to pay $70 million to
settle a suit by investors claiming the bank misstated its
subprime asset losses.  The settlement, filed in federal court in  Manhattan  today,
must be approved by a judge before it can take effect.  In July, U.S. District Judge  Victor Marrero  in Manhattan
threw out claims by the Louisiana Municipal Employees Retirement
System against Zurich-based Credit Suisse, ruling they were
barred by the  Supreme Court ’s decision in Morrison v. National
Australia Bank. In that case, the high court held that U.S.
securities laws don’t apply to claims of foreign buyers of non-
U.S. stocks on foreign exchanges.  The settlement filed today would resolve claims against
Credit Suisse by all purchasers of its American Depositary
shares on the  New York  Stock Exchange and U.S. residents who
bought the bank’s stock on the Swiss Stock Exchange from Feb.
15, 2007, to April 14, 2008.  The case is Cornwell v. Credit Suisse Group, 08-cv-3758,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
