Hanjin Shipping Co.,  South Korea ’s
largest container line, said it is considering whether to divert
a ship due to dock in Tokyo tomorrow after an 8.9-magnitude

the options,” Sonya Cho, a spokeswoman at Hanjin, said by phone.  There hasn’t been damage to Hanjin’s terminal and office in
Tokyo, she said.  Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. has not received any reports of
