  South Africa  “fully backs” the
African Union’s position on the political crisis in  Ivory Coast ,
supporting its call for Laurent Gbagbo to relinquish the
presidency, said Clayson Monyela, spokesman for the country’s
International Relations Ministry.  South Africa had previously been neutral on the post-
election stalement in the West African nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
