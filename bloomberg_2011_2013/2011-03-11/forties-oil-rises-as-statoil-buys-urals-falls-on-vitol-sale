  North Sea  Forties crude rose after
Statoil ASA bought a cargo at a higher price. Vitol Group sold
Russian Urals for the Mediterranean at a bigger discount.  North Sea  Statoil bought 600,000 barrels of Forties for March 30 to
April 1 loading from Vitol at 5 cents above benchmark Dated
Brent, according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring
the daily Platts trading window. This compares with a discount
of 5 cents for the last trade done March 9.  BP Plc sought to buy one cargo for March 29 to April 1 at
parity to Dated Brent without success, while Royal Dutch Shell
Plc failed to sell a shipment for March 29 to March 31 at 15
cents below the cash cost of North Sea crudes for May, the
survey showed.  Glencore International AG was unable to buy 100,000 metric
tons of Urals for March 26 to March 30 delivered to Rotterdam at
$4.05 less than Dated Brent, according to the survey.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window that ends at 4:30 p.m. in  London . Prior to the
window, Forties loading 10 to 21 days in the future cost 3 cents
more than Dated Brent, compared with an 8-cent discount
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.    Brent crude  for April settlement traded at $114.19 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of
the window, down from $114.22 yesterday. The May contract was at
$114.12, 7 cents less expensive than April.  Four cargoes of North Sea Forties crude were dropped from
the loading program for March, three traders who participate in
the market said today.  Shipments originally planned for three-day loading periods
starting March 25, March 27, March 28 and March 30 were dropped,
bringing the total number of cargoes this month to 23, according
to three people with knowledge of the trades who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  Mediterranean  Vitol sold 80,000 tons of Urals crude for loading March 25
to March 29 to Shell at $3.30 a barrel below Dated Brent,
compared with a discount of $1.80 for the last transaction Feb.
25, the survey showed.  Urals was assessed at $3.08 below Dated Brent today,
compared with a discount of $3 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  OAO Transneft, which operates  Russia ’s crude pipeline
system, has suspended oil deliveries to Primorsk because tanker
shipments from the Baltic port are hampered by ice.  West Africa  Indian Oil Corp. is scheduled to award its second spot
tender for sweet crude for loading in May today, and the result
isn’t yet available, according to traders involved in the
transactions of the region’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
