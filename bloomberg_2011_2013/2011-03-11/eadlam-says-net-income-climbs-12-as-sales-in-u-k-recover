  Headlam Group Plc (HEAD) , a U.K.
distributor of carpets and tiles, said today profit climbed 12
percent last year as U.K. sales recovered.  Net income rose to 17.9 million pounds ($28.7 million) in
2010, from 15.9 million pounds, the Birmingham,  England  based
company said in a Regulatory News Service statement today. Sales
rose 0.4 percent to 535.7 million pounds in the same period from
533.8 million pounds the previous year. Earnings per share rose
12.6 percent to 21.5 pence.  “We have made a positive start to 2011,” said Chairman
Graham Waldron in today’s statement. “It does give a good
indication to future trading assuming normal seasonality.”  Sales in the U.K., which represent 81 percent of group
revenue, climbed 0.4 percent on a like-for-like basis, while
sales in continental  Europe  fell 0.7 percent on a comparable
basis for the period.  Headlam, which was unchanged yesterday at 300 pence, has
declined 4.3 percent this year, valuing the company at 249.4
million pounds.  The company said in January that results for the year are
“likely to be marginally ahead of market expectations.”  Headlam said it is increasing its final dividend by 17
percent to 8.57 pence per share, giving a 13 percent increase in
the full-year dividend to 12.4 pence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
