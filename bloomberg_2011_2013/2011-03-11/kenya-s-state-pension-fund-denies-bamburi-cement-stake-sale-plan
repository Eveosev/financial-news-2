Kenya’s National Social Security
Fund  will “not necessarily” sell its entire 14 percent stake
in Bamburi Cement Co.,  Lafarge SA (LG) ’s Kenyan unit, disputing an
earlier report, Managing Trustee Alex Kazongo said.  The state-run pension company “has not reached any
decision to exit from” Bamburi, Kazongo said in statement in
the Nairobi-based  Business Daily  today, contradicting a March 9
story the newspaper published, citing Kazongo.  Kazongo ceased to be director of Bamburi on March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
