Crew changes on ships at ports in
Tokyo Bay were disrupted after an 8.9 magnitude earthquake hit
the north of the country and caused a tsunami, an agent that
organizes the switchovers said.  The changes, in which sailors and captains disembark to be
replaced by new crew, were canceled or postponed,  Inchcape
Shipping Services  said in an e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
