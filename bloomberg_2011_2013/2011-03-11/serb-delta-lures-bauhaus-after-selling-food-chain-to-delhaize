Delta Real Estate, a member of the
Belgrade-based Delta Holdings, will sign a deal with  Germany ’s
Bauhaus retail chain offering home improvement, gardening and
workshop products, to set up the first German “Do-It-Yourself”
store in  Serbia .  The agreement between the two companies will be signed on
March 14, Delta said in an e-mail today, just days after its
owner, Miroslav Miskovic, sold his Delta Maxi Group of food
retail stores to Belgium’s  Delhaize Group SA (DELB) , on March 3, for
932.5 million euros ($1.28 billion) including debt to revive
sales growth.  Belgrade-based Delta Holding is the largest private
employer in Serbia, with holdings in real estate, retail and
food distribution. Its annual sales equal about 9 percent of the
country’s gross domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
