  Areva SA (CEI) , the world’s largest maker
of nuclear reactors, and  Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/)  signed an
agreement today to make components for future nuclear power
plant contracts in the U.K. and elsewhere.  Areva will supply the nuclear steam generating systems for
four EPR reactors that Electricite de France SA may build in the
U.K., the Paris-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  It’s also competing to supply four EPRs to Horizon Nuclear
Power Ltd., a joint venture between the U.K. units of RWE AG and
E.ON AG, and is in talks with NuGeneration Ltd., a joint venture
between Iberdrola SA, Scottish & Southern Energy Plc and GDF
Suez SA, to build two EPRs.  “Within the scope of these projects, an estimated 70
percent to 80 percent of the total auxiliary equipment
manufacturing could be available to U.K. companies and a similar
percentage for civil construction,” Areva said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
