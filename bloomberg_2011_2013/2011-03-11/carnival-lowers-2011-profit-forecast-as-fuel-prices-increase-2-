  Carnival Corp. (CCL) , the world’s biggest
cruise-line operator, reduced its fiscal 2011 earnings forecast
because of higher fuel prices and itinerary changes stemming
from unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.  Earnings per share for the year will be $2.50 to $2.60,
down from $2.90 to $3.10 forecast Dec. 21, the Miami-based
company said in a statement today. Analysts projected $2.93, the
average of 24 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Since the December forecast, crude  oil prices  increased 14
percent through yesterday. Political unrest in countries
including Libya, Egypt and Bahrain has heightened the  risk
premium  in oil prices, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said today.  Carnival fell 38 cents to $40.07 at 11:10 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had dropped 12
percent this year before today.  The company said 40 cents of the reduction is due to rising
fuel prices and an additional five cents for the route changes
to the Middle East and North Africa.  The operator of cruise lines, including Seabourn, Princess
Cruises and Cunard, also reported first-quarter profit of 19
cents a share today, matching the average of analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The company said it will release its full
earnings report March 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
