The U.K. Financial Services
Authority ordered 140 financial companies to hire outside
experts to produce “skilled persons’ reports,” into such
aspects as capital adequacy, governance and complaint-handling
in the fiscal year ending this month, the Financial Times
reported, citing an FSA report on the role of auditors.  That’s an increase of 60 percent over the previous year and
compares with 18 probes ordered in 2006-2007, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
