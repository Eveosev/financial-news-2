Abu Dhabi’s Murban crude oil rose
to the highest in two months as refiners purchased supplies
with large middle-distillate yields to benefit from higher
processing profits.  Murban for May loading, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil
Co., gained 4 cents to a premium of 50 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the highest since Jan. 5. Qatar Marine for the same
period rose 20 cents to a premium of 48 cents, Bloomberg data
showed.  Refiners have been snatching up grades that yield a large
amount of gasoil as processing profits climb to the highest in
more than two years. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai, a measure of
refining profit, climbed 5 cents to $19.77 a barrel today, data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. showed. It reached $20.61 March 8.  Japan was struck today by an initial 8.9-magnitude
earthquake off the north coast near the city of Sendai. The

barrel-a-day refinery in the city of Chiba, near Tokyo, after a
fire started at the facility’s storage tanks, company spokesman
Yusuke Kanada said. JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. has shut its
refineries in Sendai, Kashima and Negishi, with a combined
processing capacity of about 600,000 barrels daily.  Oman oil for immediate loading fell $1.57, or 1.4 percent,
to $109.01 a barrel today, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai

crude dropped 1.3 percent to $112.64.  Oman futures for May delivery were down $1.81 to $108.99 a
