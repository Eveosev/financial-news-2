  Egypt â€™s military rulers ordered the
release of Abboud and Tarek El-Zomor, who were imprisoned for
their role in the assassination of former President Anwar Sadat,
the semi-official  Al Ahram  newspaper said today.  The two were kept in prison after their sentences finished,
the newspaper said. The release decision covers 60 political
prisoners, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
