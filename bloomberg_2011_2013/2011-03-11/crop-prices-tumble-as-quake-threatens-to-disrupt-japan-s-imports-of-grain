Corn, wheat, soybean and rice
futures tumbled after Japan, a major importer of U.S. crops, was
struck by its largest earthquake on record, threatening to curb
grain demand.  Japan, the largest buyer of U.S. corn, is checking ports
and grain depots for damage after an 8.9-magnitude earthquake
and a tsunami that engulfed towns on the northern coast, the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said. Farmland
was flooded with burning debris in some areas as the tidal surge
swept inland, images from state broadcaster NHK showed.  The quake “will likely impact grain trade” after ports in
Kushiro, Hachinohe, Ishinomaki and Kashima were hit by the
tsunami, and some feed mills and livestock operations were hurt,
the U.S. Grains Council said. Japan is the second-biggest buyer
of U.S. wheat and rice and ranks third for soybeans, government
data show. Last month, grain prices surged to the highest since
2008 as rising demand and adverse weather cut inventories.  “There is no way to assess even the direct damage to
Japan’s economy, or to the global economy,” Carl B. Weinberg,
the chief economist at Valhalla, New York-based High Frequency
Economics Ltd., said in a note to clients. “Experience tells us
that the economic shock can be, and likely will be, much bigger
than anyone can imagine.”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 18.5 cents, or 2.7
percent, to settle at $6.6425 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $6.5275, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 31. This week, the
grain slumped 8.8 percent, the most since mid-November. The
commodity climbed to a 31-month high of $7.4425 on Feb. 22.  14% Weekly Loss  Wheat futures for May delivery dropped 21.75 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $7.1875 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched
$7.0375, the lowest since Dec. 1. This week, the grain plunged
14 percent, the most since December 2008.  The earthquake is unlikely to cause significant damage to
Japan’s feed and food production, said Nobuyuki Chino, the
president of Tokyo-based Unipac Grain Ltd.  There are no large-scale facilities to produce livestock
feed and wheat flour in Miyagi, which was hardest hit by the
temblor, said Chino, who has traded grain for three decades.
Factories in the region are supplied with grain unloaded at five
or six local ports that are too small to accept Panamax-size
vessels, he said in a telephone interview.  ‘Unknown Variables’  “Everyone took the earthquake as a negative, because there
were so many unknown variables out there,” said Jim Daven, the
chief executive officer of Commercial Grain Inc., a Conway,
Arkansas-based brokerage and merchandiser. “Now we’re hearing
that transportation is up, and maybe it was not in a really
vital area of commerce, as compared to Tokyo or some other major
ports.”  Soybean futures for May delivery dropped 21 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $13.345 a bushel. This week, the price fell 5.6
percent, the most since October. On Feb. 9, the oilseed reached
a 30-month high of $14.5575 as Chinese demand for U.S. supplies
surged to a record.  Rice futures for May delivery fell 4 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $13.01 per 100 pounds. Earlier, the price touched $12.48, the
lowest since Oct. 6. This week, the commodity tumbled 8.3
percent, the most since January 2009.  Japan  imported  14.343 million tons of U.S. corn last year,
almost twice as much as  Mexico , the second-biggest buyer,
government data show. The country’s U.S. wheat purchases were
3.148 million tons, trailing only  Nigeria ’s.  The U.S. shipped 2.347 million tons of soybeans and 388,900
tons of  rice  to Japan last year, according to the USDA. China
and Mexico were the leading soybean buyers, and Mexico ranked
first for rice.  To contact the reporters on this story:
