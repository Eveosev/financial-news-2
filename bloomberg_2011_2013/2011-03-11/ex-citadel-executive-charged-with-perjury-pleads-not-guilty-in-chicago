Mikhail Malyshev, a former Citadel
Investment Group LLC executive, pleaded not guilty to charges he
committed perjury in the course of a lawsuit the firm filed
against him in 2009.  Malyshev is accused of lying under oath about the extent of
his use of data-scrubbing software after being sued by Chicago-
based Citadel for breach of an agreement not to compete with the
firm where he’d led its high-speed electronic trading unit.  He entered his plea in a March 9 arraignment at the Cook
County Circuit Court in  Chicago , defense lawyer Marvin Bloom
said today in a telephone interview. An arbitration panel found
the erased data was immaterial to the lawsuit, Bloom said.  “It has to be material” to support a perjury charge, the
attorney said of the erased data. Malyshev’s next scheduled
court date is April 7.  Malyshev, according to a statement by Cook County Sheriff
Tom Dart, admitted lying in an affidavit, in a deposition and in
court about whether he had used the data-scrubbing software to
purge active files from his computer.  The former Citadel executive, who left to establish his own
electronic trading firm, was hit with a $1 million sanction for
destroying potentially relevant data, Dart said.  The case is People of the State of  Illinois  v. Malyshev,
11cr2717, Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court, Criminal
Division (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
