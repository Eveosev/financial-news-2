  Southern Co. (SO) ’s $77 million legal
award against the U.S. government was cut about 78 percent by a
federal court and further proceedings on damages were ordered.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington today  affirmed  $17 million of the initial July 2007
award, where Southern had claimed the Energy Department breached
contracts by failing to accept spent nuclear fuel for storage.
The Southern units sought damages for the cost of constructing
storage facilities and additional costs at three  power plants .  The ruling affirms the costs for one facility and sends the
dispute on the other two back to a lower court. The U.S.
government had argued that Southern would have incurred the
storage costs at the three plants even if the contracts weren’t
breached.  A lawyer for the units didn’t immediately return a call
seeking comment. Atlanta-based Southern is the biggest U.S.
utility owner by market value.  The case is Southern Nuclear Operating Co. v. U.S.,
2008-5020,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
