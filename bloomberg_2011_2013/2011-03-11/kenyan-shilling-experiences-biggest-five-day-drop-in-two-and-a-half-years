  Kenya ’s shilling depreciated the
most this month, extending a retreat to the weakest intraday
level in 17 years, as demand for dollars outstripped supply.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy slumped 1.6
percent to 85.7 per dollar by 2:55 p.m. in Nairobi, taking its
drop this week to 3.2 percent, the biggest since October 2008.  “The demand for the greenback is outstripping supply as
importers seek to cover their exposure on expectation of a much
weaker shilling,” John Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  With minimal inflows, the local unit will remain under
pressure in the coming days, Muli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
