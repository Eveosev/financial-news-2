Hungary may impose a tax to counter
the rising intake of fat, salt and calories, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said today.  "There are talks ongoing with the relevant ministries on
the tax types that may be introduced and their estimated
economic impact," Matolcsy wrote in a written answer to a
lawmaker posted on the parliament’s  website  today.  It’s too early to say how high the levies will be and which
products it will affect, Matolcsy said in the response to the
lawmaker, who had asked about a possible "hamburger tax."  News website Index reported last month that such a tax was
among measures being considered by the government to increase
revenue and reduce the  budget deficit . A budget plan announced
by Matolcsy last week didn’t include the food tax.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
