Tea output in Tanzania,  Africa ’s
fourth-biggest grower of the leaf, will be less than the 35,000
metric-ton target for 2010-11 after a drought cut yields, said
Mathias Assenga, director general of the country’s Tea Board.  Production in the six months through December was 1,000
tons below the forecast for the period, Assenga said today in a
phone interview from Dar es Salaam, the commercial city. A
revised estimate for the season ending June 30 will be made
after assessing January and February output figures.  “I don’t expect us to achieve our target because of the
effect of the weather on the crop,” he said. “For sure
production will be less than our target.”  Output had been projected to surpass the 33,000 tons of
2009-10 by 6.1 percent on anticipation of better weather,
according to the board. The East African nation experienced a
drought last year.  Output in 2011-12 may reach 36,000 tons because of wider
planting and better management of tea fields, Assenga said. The
forecast is lower than the 44,000 tons target made in 2008
because of less than anticipated planting and bad weather, he
said.  The board is trying to encourage farmers to introduce the
crop to areas bordering  Kenya  and to use more fertilizers,
according to the board. The main growing areas are Iringa and
Mbeya in the south, Tanga in the north-east and Kagera in the
north-west.  Four-fifths of Tanzania’s tea is sold to foreign buyers
including  South Africa , the U.K., Netherlands, Pakistan,  Germany , Ireland,  United Arab Emirates  and  India . About half of
the country’s exports are channeled through the world’s biggest
tea auction in Mombasa, a port city in neighboring Kenya.  Tanzania exported 28,064 tons of the leaf last season worth
$56.97 million in 2009-10, according to the board. It ranks
behind Kenya, Malawi and Uganda in terms of tea production in
Africa, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
