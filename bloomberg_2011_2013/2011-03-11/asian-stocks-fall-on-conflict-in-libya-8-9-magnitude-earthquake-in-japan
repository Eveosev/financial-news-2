Asian stocks fell this week,
dragging down a regional benchmark index by the most since
August, as conflict escalated in the Middle East and an
earthquake shook Japan in the final minutes of trading yesterday.  Chiyoda Corp., a Japanese contractor that gets almost half
of its sales from the Middle East, sank 6.2 percent this week in
Tokyo. Air China Ltd., the nation’s No. 1 international carrier,
lost 2.8 percent in  Hong Kong .  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the　world’s
biggest mining company, dropped 6.5 percent in Sydney. Tokio
Marine Holdings Ltd., Japan’s second-largest casualty insurer,
retreated 7.6 percent.  “The quake and fires in Tokyo only added to the regional
bearish sentiment, sending the Nikkei into a tailspin for the
close as Tokyo brokers canceled orders and staff left
buildings,” said  Gavin Parry , managing director of Parry
International Trading Ltd in Hong Kong. “It’s even more
uncertainty that could weigh on markets.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 3.1 percent to 135.03 this
week, its biggest drop since the week ended Aug. 13. The gauge
rose 1.9 percent last week as better-than-estimated economic
data from South Korea to the U.S. eased concern about surging  oil prices  following tension in North  Africa  and the Middle East.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 4.1 percent this week,
extending declines in the final 14 minutes of trading following
the 8.9-magnitude earthquake that struck at 2:46 p.m. local time
yesterday. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 4.5 percent,
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.7 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3 percent. South Korea’s  Kospi
Index (KOSPI)  declined 2.5 percent.  Libya Unrest  Chiyoda fell 6.2 percent to 685 yen. JGC Corp., a
competitor that gets 34 percent of sales from the Middle East,
dropped 6.5 percent to 1,759 yen. Daewoo Engineering &
Construction Co., which gets 27 percent of sales in Africa and
the Middle East, retreated 3 percent to 11,200 won in  Seoul .  Oil surged above $105 a barrel this week as Libyan leader
Muammar Qaddafi’s forces escalated a war against rebels this
week, carrying out air and artillery strikes. Government forces
drove rebels from the Mediterranean oil hub of Ras Lanuf after
Qaddafi’s son pledged to mount a full-scale attack against an
uprising that has split the country.  “The situation in the Middle East provided a trigger for
the market correction,”  Shane Oliver , head of investment
strategy in Sydney at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages
about $93 billion, said on Bloomberg Television. “All of these
concerns are combining and making investors somewhat nervous.”  Japanese Earthquake  Air  China  lost 2.8 percent to HK$7.23 in Hong Kong. All
Nippon Airways Co., Asia’s largest listed carrier by sales,
declined 1.4 percent to 281 yen in Tokyo, even after President
Shinichiro Ito said the company has hedged 85 percent of its
fuel needs for the current fiscal year. BHP Billiton declined
6.5 percent to A$44.19 in Sydney.  Japanese shares extended losses following the earthquake
that struck northeast of Tokyo. Tokio Marine fell 7.6 percent to
2,512 yen. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker,
lost 5 percent to 3,595 yen. Fanuc Corp., Japan’s biggest maker
of industrial robots, sank 4.7 percent to 12,350 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has almost doubled in the past
two years. It sank to an eight-year low on March 9, 2009,
following the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
in September 2008. Shares in the index traded at 13.6 times
estimated earnings on average at yesterday’s close of trading in  Asia , the lowest level since September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
