  Italy ’s economy expanded more than
originally reported in the fourth quarter as gains in exports 
more than offset weak consumer demand.  Gross domestic product rose 1.5 percent in the final
quarter from a year earlier, more than the 1.3 percent
originally reported, Rome-based statistics institute  Istat  said
in its final GDP report today. The economy expanded 0.1 percent
from a the previous quarter, Istat said today, matching its Feb.
15 preliminary report.  Sales of goods abroad rose 0.5 percent and national
household spending rose 0.3 percent from the third quarter,
according to the report.  As slowing global demand limits exports and  consumer
spending  remains weak, the recovery in the euro region’s third-
biggest economy may lose pace in coming months. In January
unemployment remained close to the highest level in more than 7
years and industrial production unexpectedly fell 1.5 percent in
the same month. Business confidence declined in February as
executives cited “a worsening in the production outlook and
higher stocks,” Istat said.  The $2.3 trillion economy grew an annual 1.3 percent last
year as it benefited from a rebound in global trade after
contracting 5.2 percent in 2009 during its worst recession since
World War II. Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  last month raised
Italy’s economic growth forecast to 1.5 percent for this year,
from 1.3 percent in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
