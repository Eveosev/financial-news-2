A majority of Spanish savings banks
that donâ€™t meet core  capital requirements  would prefer to obtain
aid from a government rescue fund rather than accept offers from
private investors,  Expansion  reported.  Offers from private investors for stakes in the banks are
so low that the institutions have started to consider the fund,
known as the Frob, as a preferred shareholder, the newspaper
said, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  Banks will have two more years to look for other investors
and higher valuations if they seek aid from the fund, the
newspaper added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
