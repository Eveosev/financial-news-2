Tianjin Port Group Co. plans to
invest 110 billion yuan ($16.7 billion) by 2015 to help boost
annual cargo volumes as growth in the world’s second-biggest
economy spurs demand for sea transport.  “The fundamental factors are all positive toward stable
growth” of cargo volumes with the global economic recovery,
Chairman Yu Rumin said in an interview in Beijing today while
attending the national legislature’s annual meeting.  The state-owned company aims to boost annual cargo
shipments to as much as 600 million tons, Yu said. Container
volumes may more than double from last year to as much as 20
million units a year by 2015, Yu said.  --Tian Ying. Editors: Suresh Seshadri,  Michael Tighe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
