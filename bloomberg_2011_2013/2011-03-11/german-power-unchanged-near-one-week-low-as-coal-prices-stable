German electricity for delivery
next year was unchanged from its lowest close in more than a
week as coal prices were stable.  Baseload power for 2012 was unchanged at 53.15 euros
($73.44) a megawatt-hour, its lowest close since March 3,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg at 10:20 a.m. Berlin
time. Baseload is generated and sold around the clock.  The contract,  Europe â€™s benchmark electricity price, is
headed for its first weekly drop in four weeks. It has traded
between 50.75 euros and 54.60 euros this year.  Coal for 2011 delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp
gained 0.4 percent to $122.25 a metric ton.  Germany  generates
about a fifth of its power from hard coal. The country also gets
electricity from nuclear, natural gas, wind and solar sources.  Baseload is delivered around the clock. Bloomberg tracks
prices from brokers including ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc., Spectron
Group Ltd., Tullett Prebon Plc and Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
