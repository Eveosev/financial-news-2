Farm ministers and officials from
more than 100 countries agreed to consider which crop genes to
share as part of a 2004 treaty on genetic resources that for now
excludes tomatoes, the  United Nations  said.  Under the treaty, member countries share the genetic
material of 64 crops that are the most important for food
security, the UN’s Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization
said in a statement on its website.  Wheat, rice and potatoes are among the crops included in
the treaty, while tomatoes were excluded in negotiations a
decade ago that led to the accord, the FAO said. The crops that
are part of the treaty account for 80 percent of the world’s
plant-sourced food, the agency said.  “The more efficiently crops are protected under the
treaty, the better humankind will be able to conserve and share
crop-genetic resources to meet the enormous  food security 
challenges of the present and future generations,” Shakeel
Bhatti, the treaty secretary, said in the statement.  The International Treaty on Genetic Resources for Food and
Agriculture created a system to manage a pool of more than
1.3 million unique crop samples, as well as a fund to help poor
farmers in  developing countries  adapt their crops to
environmental change, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
