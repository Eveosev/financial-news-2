President  Barack Obama  said the
international community is “slowly tightening the noose” on
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  through sanctions and aid to anti-
government forces with more actions, including a military
response, being considered.  “I have not taken any options off the table,” Obama said
at a White House news conference. Any military response must be
“well thought-through,” he said.  Obama said he was “concerned” about Qaddafi’s continued
use of troops and firepower against rebels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
