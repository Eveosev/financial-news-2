  Sudan , Yemen and Syria are among
the nations most prone to unrest in the Middle East and North
Africa, trailing only Libya in a ranking of 20 countries in the
Bloomberg Combustibility Index.  Qatar, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates are rated by the
index as least likely to experience the kind of turmoil that has
threatened Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi’s rule and toppled
regimes in Egypt and Tunisia.  The index is based on variables including gross domestic
product adjusted for purchasing power parity, unemployment,
median age, income inequality, access to information and
repression.  The repression factor accounts for 50 percent of the weight
of the variables. It was calculated from the size of a country’s
military per capita, length of tenure of the head of state,
whether the head had a military background, whether the head is
also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, whether the head
came to power in a military coup or following an assassination,
military spending as a percentage of GDP and absolute military
spending.  The 20 countries on the list, from most prone to unrest to
least, are  Libya , Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Oman, Djibouti,  Iran , Iraq, Tunisia, Bahrain, Algeria, Mauritania, Lebanon,
Jordan,  Saudi Arabia , Morocco, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
Qatar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
