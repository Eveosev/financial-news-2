OPEC’s compliance with the
production quotas its members agreed to in 2008 fell last month
as  Saudi Arabia  raised output to almost 9 million barrels a day.  Average daily output from the 11 members of the group bound
by quotas rose 131,200 barrels a day to 27.38 million barrels a
day in February, the group’s Vienna-based  secretariat  said today
in a monthly report. That implies compliance of 40 percent
compared with a revised 43 percent in January.  Saudi Arabia, the organization’s largest member and de
facto leader, boosted production to 8.87 million barrels a day,
an increase of 279,600 barrels. Venezuela and Angola made the
next-biggest contributions to last month’s gain, pumping 2.39
million and 1.7 million daily barrels a day, respectively.  Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are discussing whether to hold an emergency meeting in
response to protests in  Libya  that have cut the country’s
production in half, Kuwait’s oil minister, Sheikh Ahmad al-
Abdullah al-Sabah, said on March 8. The group, responsible for
about 40 percent of global crude supply, is next due to meet on
June 8.  In December 2008, OPEC announced a supply cut of 4.2
million barrels a day, giving a collective production ceiling of
24.845 million, as demand collapsed around the world in the wake
of the financial crisis. The group has since raised output as
prices and demand rebound. Brent crude futures traded around
$114 a barrel in  London  today.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran ,  Iraq ,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and  Venezuela . Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
