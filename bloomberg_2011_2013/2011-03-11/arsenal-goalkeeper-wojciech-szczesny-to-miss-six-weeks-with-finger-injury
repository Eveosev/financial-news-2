Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech
Szczesny will miss six weeks with a finger injury sustained in a
Champions League loss at Barcelona three days ago, manager
Arsene Wenger said on the club’s website  Szczesny played just 18 minutes of the 3-1 defeat at the
Nou Camp which knocked Arsenal out of the Champions League.
He’ll see a specialist to determine the full extent of the
injury.    Manuel Almunia  replaced Szczesny against Barcelona and will
be in goal for tomorrow’s F.A. Cup game at  Manchester United .
The Spaniard, who lost his starting job this season, is the only
goalkeeper on the first-team squad as Lukasz Fabianski and on-
loan Vito Mannone are also sidelined with injuries.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
