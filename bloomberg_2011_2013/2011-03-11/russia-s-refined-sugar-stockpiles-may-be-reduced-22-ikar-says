  Russia ’s white, or refined, sugar
stockpiles by the end of March may be reduced 22 percent from a
year earlier, according to Yevgeny Ivanov, an analyst at the
 Institute for Agricultural Market Studies .  Stockpiles will drop to an estimated 1.3 million metric
tons by March 31, from 1.7 million tons a year earlier, Ivanov
said by e-mail today. Raw sugar reserves may be down to 136,000
tons from 295,000 tons over the same period, he said.  Raw sugar prices jumped 19 percent last year, partly on
speculation drought in Russia would curb its sugar beet crop and
boost its demand for sweetener imports. Russia’s sugar
consumption in the first quarter will be little changed at 1.1
million tons from the first quarter of 2010, according to Ikar
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
