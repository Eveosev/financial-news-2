What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 15 cents to 20 cents a bushel lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade, Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  as investors reduce bets on higher
commodity prices after Japan was hit by the biggest earthquake
on record, said  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president for
the Linn Group in Chicago.  -- Corn futures are called to open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago on speculation that the earthquake may reduce
global economic growth and demand for grain in Japan, Huckabay
said.  -- Soybean futures may open 15 cents to 20 cents lower a bushel
on the CBOT as the quake and rising global  interest rates  damp
demand, Huckabay said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.7 cent to 0.9 cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may
open down $2 to $5 for 2,000 pounds of the  animal feed .  To contact the reporters on this story:
