  Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the largest producer of
motor fuels made from coal, hasn’t received any reports of
damage to its operations in Asia from an earthquake and tsunami
in Japan, spokeswoman Jacqui O’Sullivan said.  “We’re still waiting to hear from our operations in the
region, though there have been no reports so far of damage,”
she said by phone from Johannesburg today.  Sasol has offices and operations in Japan, Malaysia,
Singapore, China and elsewhere in Australasia, according to its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
