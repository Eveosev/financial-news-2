  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  said it is severing
ties with affiliates in Illinois, citing a law signed today that
imposes taxes on consumers who make online purchases.  The affiliates -- websites that send customers to Amazon
through links -- will no longer be paid for sales that result
from the referrals, Seattle-based Amazon said today in an e-
mail.  This is the latest salvo in a fight between Amazon and
states including California, New York and North Carolina over
efforts to collect tax from the world’s largest online retailer.  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) ,  Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS)  and Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. have all begun publicly courting affiliates that Amazon has
cut off.  “We had opposed this new tax law because it is
unconstitutional and counterproductive,” Amazon said. “It was
supported by national retailing chains, most of which are based
outside Illinois, that seek to harm the affiliate advertising
programs of their competitors.”  Amazon fell $2.91 to $166.14 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained 27 percent
in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
