Most U.S. stocks fell, joining a
global equity retreat, following an 8.9-magnitude earthquake in
Japan that was the nation’s largest on record and a decline in
consumer companies after Americans’ confidence slipped.  Consumer companies led losses in the  S&P 500  after the
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of
sentiment fell to 68.2 in March from 77.5 in February. The gauge
was projected to decline to 76.3, according to the median
estimate of 68 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  More than three stocks fell for every two that rose on U.S.
exchanges at 10 a.m. New York time. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index gained less than 0.1 percent to 1,295.62, and the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  slumped 15.90 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 11,968.71. The S&P 500 has retreated 2 percent this week.  “There’s a bumper crop of uncertainty right now,” said  David Kelly , who helps oversee $450 billion as chief market
strategist at JPMorgan Funds in  New York . “There’s a heightened
level of uncertainty about the Middle East, Europe and now
Japan. The fundamentals suggest being overweight equities versus
fixed income. However, with all this uncertainty, we don’t know
how things will shake out over the next few weeks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
