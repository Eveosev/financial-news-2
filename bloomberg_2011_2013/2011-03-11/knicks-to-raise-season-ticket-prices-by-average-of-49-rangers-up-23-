The  New York Knicks  raised season-
ticket prices for 2011-12 by an average of 49 percent, with the
team in line to make the National Basketball Association
playoffs for the first time in seven years.  Season-ticket prices for the  National Hockey League ’s  New
York Rangers , who also are owned  Madison Square Garden Inc. (MSG) ,
will increase by an average of 23 percent, MSG said in a news
release.  The franchises this fall will debut the first phase of an
overhaul of Madison Square Garden that may cost as much as $978
million.  The Knicks haven’t raised ticket prices since the 2004-05
season, which followed the team’s last playoff appearance. The
Rangers didn’t raise season-ticket prices this season, the
release said.  Knicks’ season ticket prices will rise to a range of $10-
$3,600 per game next season from a current range of $10-$3,000,
Stacey Escudero, a spokeswoman for Madison Square Garden, said
in an e-mail. Rangers prices will range from $39-$1,200 per game
for 2011-12, with current prices at $37-$1,125.  Renovation of Madison Square Garden’s lower bowl is
scheduled to be complete before the 2011-12 basketball and
hockey seasons, and the upper bowl a year later. Most of the
work will be done during the summer months, leaving it fully
operational during the seasons of the Knicks and Rangers.  The Knicks, who acquired All-Star forward  Carmelo Anthony 
on Feb. 22, are 34-30, sixth in the Eastern Conference with 18
games remaining in the regular season.  The Rangers are eighth in the NHL’s Eastern Conference with
a 35-30-4 record for 74 points, two points ahead of the Caroline
Hurricanes. The top eight teams in a conference
make the playoffs in both the NBA and NHL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
