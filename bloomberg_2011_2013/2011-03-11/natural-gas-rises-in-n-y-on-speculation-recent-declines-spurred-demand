Natural gas futures rose, capping a
second weekly gain in three, on speculation that an 12 percent
decline in prices this year may boost demand from factories and  power plants .  Gas advanced 1.5 percent as the Energy Department estimated
industrial demand will increase 3.7 percent in 2011 and power
plants will consume more gas. Prices also rose after an
earthquake in Japan spurred speculation that the country’s
demand for liquefied natural gas would increase as nuclear
plants were shut.  “Prices are not going to go much lower and the real world
has to enter at some point,” said Ed Kennedy, a trader at INTL
Hencorp Futures in Miami. “There is a lot of buying at this
level because utilities are locking in prices.”  Natural gas for April delivery gained 5.9 cents to settle
at $3.889 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures rose 2.1 percent this week.  The number of U.S. gas drilling rigs declined 17 this week
to 882, the lowest level in 13 months, according to a report
today from Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc.  Japan’s demand for cargoes of LNG may increase after the
earthquake halted nuclear generation. Japan is the world’s
biggest LNG importer.  “Not that we are using tons of LNG, but psychologically we
are getting a little boost,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst with
PFGBest in  Chicago .  Eleven reactors operated by companies such as Tokyo
Electric Power Co.,  Asia ’s biggest utility, were shut, Japan’s
Trade Ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  LNG Shipments  The closures are unlikely to raise LNG re-exports from the
U.S., according to Zach Allen, president of Pan Eurasian
Enterprises Inc., a Raleigh, North Carolina-based tracker of LNG
shipments.  “The reactors were shut as a precautionary measure,” said
Allen. “It takes at least 30 days to find a ship and move LNG
from the U.S. to Japan, and by that time the nuclear plants may
well be up and running.”  LNG imports to the U.S. this year will be the equivalent of
1.15 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, about 1.7 percent
of total gas demand, according to Energy Department estimates.  The shutdown of Tokyo Electric’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear
after an earthquake in July 2007 boosted the use of oil-and gas-
fired generation units as Japan paid more than $20 per million
Btu for spare LNG cargoes.  Industrial demand for gas in the U.S. will average 18.75
billion cubic feet a day this year, up from 18.08 billion in
2010, the Energy Department said in the  Short-Term Energy
Outlook  on March 8. Demand from power plants will average 20.28
billion cubic feet a day, up from 20.22 billion.  Gas Supplies  U.S. gas stockpiles fell 71 billion cubic feet in the week
ended March 4 to 1.674 trillion cubic feet, the Energy
Department said yesterday. The total was above five-year average
levels for the first time since January.  Inventories may drop to 1.549 trillion cubic feet by the
end of the winter heating season, the department said. Last
year, supplies totaled 1.665 trillion as of April 1, according
to department data.  Gas declined earlier as the  National Weather Service  said
temperatures will be above normal across much of the country
from March 16 to March 20.  The high in New York on March 19 will be 56 degrees
Fahrenheit (13 Celsius), 5 degrees above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
271,424 as of 2:41 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 299,000. Volume was 313,508 yesterday. Open interest was
942,655 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
860,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
