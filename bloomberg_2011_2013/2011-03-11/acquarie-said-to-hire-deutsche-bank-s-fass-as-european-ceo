  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s
largest investment bank, hired David Fass from  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
to be its chief executive officer for  Europe .  He will join Macquarie in June after 10 years at Deutsche
Bank, the Sydney-based firm said in a statement today. He will
replace Benoit Savoret, who stepped down less than five weeks
after taking up the post.  Fass, 48, was head of European global banking at Deutsche
Bank until October 2009. Macquarie has been expanding outside
its home market through acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe. The
firm bought the equity trading and research business of Sal.
Oppenheim Jr. & Cie. last year.  “He has a distinguished track record of leadership, and of
building enduring businesses and client relationships,”
Macquarie CEO Nicholas Moore said in the statement.  Fass declined to comment when reached on his mobile phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
