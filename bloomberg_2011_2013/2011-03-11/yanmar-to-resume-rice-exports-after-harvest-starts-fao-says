Myanmar will probably resume rice
exports after the new harvest starts in April, according to the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization.  “The export ban is a seasonal adjustment every year to
keep enough stock before harvest begins next month,” said
Hiroyuki Konuma, the FAO’s regional representative in  Asia .
“When the Myanmar harvest starts, then I’m sure they won’t
continue the ban,” Konuma said late yesterday after a meeting
with Myanmar delegates during a conference in Bangkok.  Myanmar suspended exports from the last week of February to
ensure rice prices are not driven higher by shortages,  Associated Press  reported on March 3, citing a rice exporter who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Khin Hla Thein, deputy director
of the Planning Department, under the Ministry of National
Planning and Economic Development, declined to comment.  The export restriction “has nothing to do with the
international market,” Konuma said. There was no specific food
price increase in Myanmar, he added.  Myanmar is estimated to export 500,000 tons this year,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  To contact the reporter on this story:
