Gorenje Group d.d., Slovenia’s
biggest maker of home appliances, returned to profit last year
on renewed consumer demand for its products as European
economies recovered.  Net income was 20 million euros ($28 million), compared
with a loss of 12.2 million euros in 2009, the Velenje-based
company said in a  statement  to the Ljubljana stock exchange
today. Revenue advanced 16.5 percent to 1.38 billion euros and
the company is aiming for 1.55 billion this year.  Gorenje, Slovenia’s second-biggest exporter after Renault
SA’s subsidiary in Novo Mesto, is benefiting from increased
demand for cookers, refrigerators and other appliances as
European economies recover and people spend more. Chief
Executive Officer Franjo Bobinac said prices may be increased to
offset rising commodity costs.  The company will focus on “integrating Asko into the
group, disposing of non-performing property, neutralizing
mounting raw and processed materials costs and developing new
products to win market share,” Bobinac said, according to the
statement.  Gorenje shares dropped 14 euro cents, or 1.1 percent, to
11.75 euros at the close. The company has lost 13 percent of its
value this year, compared with a 3 percent decline by the SBITOP
benchmark index, making it the worst performer in the six-member
index.  Gorenje acquired Asko Appliances Group of  Sweden  for 4.5
million euros last July, to gain market share in the Nordic
countries and  North America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
