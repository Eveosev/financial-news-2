  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany â€™s biggest
bank, nominated Katherine Garrett-Cox, chief executive officer
of U.K. investment trust  Alliance Trust Plc (ATST) , to join its
supervisory board.  She would replace Sir Peter Job, former head of  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  whose membership is ending as scheduled, if elected at
the annual general meeting on May 26, the Frankfurt-based bank
said in a  statement  today. Deutsche Bank will send out
invitations for the AGM on April 5, it said.  Garrett-Cox, who has more than 21 years of experience in
the investment industry, has been CEO of Alliance Trust since
2008, Deutsche Bank said. A supervisory board in Germany
consists of shareholders and labor representatives who hire and
supervise the members of the management board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
