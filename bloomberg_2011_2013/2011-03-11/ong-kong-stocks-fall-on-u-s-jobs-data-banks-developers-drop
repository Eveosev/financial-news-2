Hong Kong stocks fell for a second
day as a U.S. jobs report dented confidence in a global economic
recovery, and as  China ’s inflation rose more than expected,
fueling tightening concerns by the nation’s government.    Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the biggest supplier to Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., sank 2.6 percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a global fashion
retailer, slid 2.2 percent. China Overseas Land & Investment

percent, while Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s

the world’s No. 1 aluminum producer, sank 4.4 percent after

close, with all but three stocks falling on the 45-member gauge.

companies declined 1.9 percent to 12,752.01 today.  “There is concern that China’s inflation still persists,”
said  Castor Pang , Hong Kong-based research director at Cinda
International Holdings Ltd. “The U.S. data shows its economy is
still slow to improve. There is quite a lot of room for the Hang

percent to HK$37.30.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , maker of Hoover

today. The index dropped 1.9 percent yesterday in  New York  after
the U.S. Labor Department said applications for first-time  unemployment benefits  rose last week.  A separate report from the Commerce Department showed the  U.S. trade deficit  widened more than forecast in January to the
highest level in seven months as a surge in imports, led by
costlier crude oil, overshadowed record exports.  The Hang Seng Index rose 2.5 percent this year through
yesterday as corporate earnings and positive economic reports
from the U.S. helped ease concern surging  oil prices  and tension
in the Middle East will slow global economic growth. Shares in
the gauge traded at an average 12.8 times estimated earnings
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese property developers and banks dropped on concern
the nation’s government may take more steps to curb inflation.
