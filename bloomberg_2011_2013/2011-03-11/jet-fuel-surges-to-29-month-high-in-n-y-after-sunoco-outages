Jet fuel in New York Harbor rose to
a 29-month high after  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  shut a fluid catalytic cracker
for unplanned work at its Philadelphia refinery, where two fires
were reported earlier this week.  Repairs to the cat cracker at the 335,000-barrel-a-day
refinery may last several weeks, according to a person with
knowledge of the situation.  The premium for jet fuel in New York Harbor versus heating
oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  increased 11
cents to 27 cents at 11:56 a.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was the highest level since Oct. 8, 2008. Prompt
delivery rose 9.39 cents to $3.2988 a gallon.  Inventories of jet fuel on the East Coast dropped 352,000
barrels last week to 10.1 million barrels, according to the
Energy Department.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline  New York 
Harbor widened 0.25 cent to 17.63 cents a gallon.  A vacuum tower at Sunoco’s Philadelphia refinery has also
been shut for repairs after a March 7 fire, while a separate
fire the following day at a heater associated with a reformer
didn’t affect operations, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
