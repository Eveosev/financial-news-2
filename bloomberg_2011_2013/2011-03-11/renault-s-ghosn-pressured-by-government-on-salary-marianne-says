  Renault SA (RNO)  Chief Executive  Carlos Ghosn  came under pressure over his salary from government
representatives at a Feb. 28 board meeting,  Marianne  reported.  The French government, which holds 15 percent of Renault
and two board seats, succeeded in setting new conditions for
Ghosn’s 2011 compensation, according to the weekly magazine,
which did not cite any sources. Renault spokeswoman Caroline De Gezelle had no immediate comment when contacted by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
