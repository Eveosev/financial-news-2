Liverpool captain  Steven Gerrard 
will miss up to four weeks after undergoing surgery for a groin
problem, the Premier League club said on its website.  Gerrard was not part of the Liverpool squad for last
night’s 1-0 loss at Braga in the Europa League round of 16. The
club said the decision to have the surgery, which it called
“successful,” came after consultation with a specialist.  If sidelined for four weeks, Gerrard would miss  England ’s
Euro 2012 qualifier against Wales on March 26, as well as
Premier League games against Sunderland, West Brom and
Manchester City.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
