  Hunter Mahan  was 7-under par
through 11 holes when first-round play at golfâ€™s Cadillac
Championship was suspended because of darkness.    Charley Hoffman  is in a group of players two shots behind,
having completed his round yesterday before a storm with 50 mph
(80 kph) winds caused an almost three-hour interruption at the
World Golf Championships event at the TPC Blue Monster at Doral,
Florida.  World No. 1 Martin Kaymer and third-ranked Luke Donald are
also 5-under, after 10 holes. Only 11 players out of 65 have
completed the opening round.    Tiger Woods , who has dropped to fifth in the Official World
Golf Ranking, and No. 4 Graeme McDowell are tied at 1-under
through 15 holes. World No. 6  Phil Mickelson , who is playing in
the same group, is 2-under.  The storm toppled 17 trees, two television towers and
hurled a television camera into a pond.  Anyone with a first-round ticket will gain admission again
today. Play is scheduled to resume at 8:30 a.m., with the second
round getting under way as originally scheduled at 11:20 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
