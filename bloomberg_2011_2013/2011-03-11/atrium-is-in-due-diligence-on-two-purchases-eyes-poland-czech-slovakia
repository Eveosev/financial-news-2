  Atrium European Real Estate Ltd. (ATRS) , 
an eastern European shopping mall developer, is performing due
diligence on two potential acquisitions and aims to close deals
this year, Chief Executive Officer Rachel Lavine said.  “We’re in the process of due diligence on two projects,”
Lavine said in a telephone interview from Amsterdam. “I have to
do some deals this year,” she added. “We’re now in March. We
hope to announce something before the end of the year.”  “I would prefer to get good acquisitions in  Poland  and in
big cities, or in the Czech and Slovak republics,” she said.  Lavine said Atrium could spend twice its cash for purchases
before raising new capital, “which means we are talking about
700 million euros. If we have to go to 800 million euros it
would still be OK,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
