  BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of
Latin America’s biggest securities exchange, fell the most in
almost a month on speculation Brazilian policy makers will
impose restrictions on foreign investment in equity markets.  BM&FBovespa slid 1.6 percent to 11.10 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, after tumbling as
much as 3.9 percent earlier. The Bovespa stock index rose 1
percent to 66,684.60.    Brazil  is considering new measures to stem gains in the
currency, including a requirement that foreign investment in
equity markets stay in the country for a certain period of time,
said a government official, who asked to remain anonymous
because the discussions aren’t public.  “BM&FBovespa would lose twice if this plan goes forward,”
said Kelly Trentin, head analyst at Spinelli Corretora in  Sao
Paulo . “Its shares would receive less foreign investments and
its revenues would be hurt by a decline in foreign investments
in all securities traded in the exchange.”  Finance Minister Guido Mantega has no plans to announce any
measures today, according to his press office in Brasilia.  The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.6649 per  U.S. dollar .  Brazil tripled a tax on foreign investors’ fixed-income
purchases to 6 percent in October as part of the effort to stem
gains in the real. Latin America’s largest economy also set  reserve requirements  on short dollar positions held by local
banks in January to stem a rally in the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
