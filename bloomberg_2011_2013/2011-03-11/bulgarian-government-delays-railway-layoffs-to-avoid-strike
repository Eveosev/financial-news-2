The Bulgarian government met
railway workers’ demands and agreed to delay layoffs, to avoid a
strike scheduled to start today.  “We signed the agreement late yesterday night,” Valentin
Nikiforov, the strike committee president, said in an interview
with the Horizont radio station in Sofia today. “ The layoffs
will be reduced and coordinated with the trade unions, to
provide alternative vocational training for those who are fired.
Payment of outstanding social benefits will start this month.”  About 60 trains stopped between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.,
yesterday during a warning strike. The  Bulgarian State Railways
EAD  needs to cut 30 percent of its employees under a 460
million-lev ($325 million) loan agreement with the  World Bank .  The railways’ losses in 2010 amounted to 218 million lev,
while its debts to banks were 572 million lev in December and
suppliers were owed 171 million, Transport Minister Alexander Tsvetkov said in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
