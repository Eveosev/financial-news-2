The  International Monetary Fund 
urged Pakistan to continue reducing its budget deficit while
recognizing current efforts after a meeting with the country’s
authorities.  “Significant fiscal consolidation will be needed in
2011/12 in order to redduce inflation and ensure debt
sustainability,” mission chief Adnan Mazarei said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “The lower budget deficit would also
help manage the impact of higher  oil prices  on the economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
