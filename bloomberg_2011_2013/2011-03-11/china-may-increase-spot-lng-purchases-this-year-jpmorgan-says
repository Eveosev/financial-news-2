China will boost spot purchases of
liquefied natural gas this year as the country’s terminal
capacity increases and term contracts start in 2012, said  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The nation’s fuel-import capacity will climb to 43.3
million metric tons a year by 2015 while long-term supply
contracts climb to 39 million, the bank’s Hong Kong-based
analysts, Brynjar Eirik Bustnes and Sophie Tan, said in a report
yesterday. Existing capacity will reach at least 12.3 million
tons this year compared with imports of 9.4 million through
Guangdong, Fujian and Shanghai terminals last year.  “China’s LNG import volumes will rise on additional
regassification capacity to be completed this year,” Bustnes
and Tan said in the report. “New long-term supply contracts are
starting in 2012, giving possible rise for the need for more
spot purchases in the meantime.”  PetroChina Co.’s first two terminals with a combined
capacity of 6.5 million tons in Jiangsu and Liaoning may be
completed in the first half. The company may rely on spot
shipments during commissioning as it waits for term supplies
from Qatar next year, according to the report.    China ’s demand for natural gas may grow by about 20 percent
to 135 billion cubic meters this year from 2010, JPMorgan said.
Domestic production may rise by at least 10 percent from 93.6
billion last year while imports of the cleaner-burning fuel
through pipelines and in liquid form may reach 32 billion from
16.2 billion, the  U.S. bank  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
