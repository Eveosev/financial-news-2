The surge in crop prices that drove
food costs to a record last month may be peaking because global
inventories are now forecast to be more plentiful than
previously expected, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  Corn will be up 1.8 percent a year from now at $6.75 a
bushel, while wheat will be 4.3 percent higher at $7.50 a
bushel, the bank said in a report. Corn surged 82 percent in the
last 12 months and wheat jumped 50 percent as flooding from  Canada  to  Australia  and drought in  Russia  ruined crops.  “This stabilization will put a lid on crop prices,”
Damien Courvalin, a New York-based analyst at the bank, said in
the report. “With the market focus shifting to the likely 2011-
12 supply response, we actually see downside risk to crop prices
in the near term, especially for corn and cotton.”  Lower prices would help ease the surge in food costs that
contributed to protests across North Africa and the Middle East
in the past few months, toppling leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia .
The acceleration in food inflation has driven 44 million more
people into extreme poverty since June, according to the  World
Bank .  Wheat futures fell for a fifth day in Chicago after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  unexpectedly  raised  its stockpile
estimate by 2.3 percent to 181.9 million metric tons. The grain
for May delivery slid 21.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $7.19 a
bushel at 7:14 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, headed for
the biggest weekly drop since December 2008.  Corn Drops  Corn retreated for a sixth session after the USDA increased
its stockpiles estimate by 0.5 percent to 123.1 million tons.
The grain for May delivery lost 19.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to
$6.6325 a bushel.  While Goldman Sachs doesn’t expect corn and wheat to keep
rallying over the next 12 months, the prices it forecast by then
would still be above the averages over the last five years.
Averages in that period were $4.18 a bushel for corn and $6.16 a
bushel for wheat, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The bank let its recommendation to investors to buy the
March 2011 corn contract traded in  Chicago  expire last week,
Courvalin said.  Price declines may be temporary as inventories are still
“critically low” and higher prices have yet to curb demand,
Goldman Sachs said. Adverse weather in the Northern Hemisphere
this year also may provide support, according to the report.
Even “average weather conditions” will not allow for
sufficient building of stockpiles, the bank said.  Soybeans, Cotton  Soybeans are most likely to remain in a supply shortage in
2011-12, and Goldman Sachs kept its recommendation to buy the
oilseed traded in Chicago for November delivery. Consumers
should “take advantage of likely lower prices in the coming
months to layer in upside protection,” the bank said.  Goldman Sachs also dropped its previous recommendation to
investors to buy the December 2011 cotton contract on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . The fiber for May delivery slid 0.7
percent to $1.9955 a pound today, rebounding from a decline of
as much as 2.2 percent. Prices will fall to $1.50 in the next
three months and $1.25 in a year, the bank estimated.  Coffee futures that have lost more than 6 percent in two
sessions in New York also may slide, the report shows. The beans
will fall to $2 a pound in three months and to $1.75 in a year,
Goldman Sachs said. Cocoa, down for four days, will drop to
$2,700 a ton in three months and to $2,400 in a year, the bank
said.  Sugar futures in New York may rise to 30 cents a pound in
three months before falling back to 20 cents, Goldman Sachs
said. Cattle contracts will remain steady at about $1.15 a pound
in the next three months in Chicago and may rise to $1.20 in a
year, while hog futures may gain to $1.05 a pound in the next
six months, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
