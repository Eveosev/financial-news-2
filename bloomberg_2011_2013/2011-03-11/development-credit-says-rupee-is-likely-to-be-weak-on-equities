Naveen Raghuvanshi, a Mumbai-based
currency trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd., comments on the
outlook for  India ’s rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency dropped
0.1 percent to 45.51 per dollar as of 11:33 a.m. in Singapore,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will decline 0.6 percent from the spot rate of
45.24.  “The rupee will be weak today and will trade around 45.25
as the equity market isn’t expected to be good. The currency
will continue to weaken as  oil prices  are also high. The market
needs some kind of inflows.  “As the oil companies are perennial buyers of the dollar,
that pressure will also be there. By the end of this month, we
see the rupee in a range of 45.10 to 45.35.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
