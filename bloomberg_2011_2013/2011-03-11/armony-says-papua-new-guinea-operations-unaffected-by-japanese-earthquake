Harmony Gold Mining Ltd. said its
operations in Papua New Guinea are operating as normal after a
tsunami warning was issued following an 8.8-magnitude earthquake
which struck off the coast of northern Japan.  “Our operations aren’t affected,” spokeswoman Marian van
der Walt said by phone from Johannesburg today. “There’s
absolutely no impact at all as we have no operations in the
areas affected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
