Cocoa fell, capping the biggest
weekly drop since May, on speculation that exports from  Ivory
Coast  will increase after the government threatened to seize
undeclared inventories. Coffee declined, and sugar gained.  Ivorian exporters have until March 31 to ship bean
stockpiles or face “sanctions,” a spokesman for President  Laurent Gbagbo  said March 9. Gbagbo has refused to step down
following a November election that international observers say
was won by  Alassane Ouattara , who has asked shippers to hold
back exports as a way of denying funds to his rival. The
government is also threatening to seize inventories not
declared by today.  “The market is realizing there is still a lot of supply,
as the situation in Ivory Coast is forcing suppliers to export
in order to pay the domestic tax,” Jonathan Bouchet, an
analyst at broker OTCex Group, said today by telephone from
Geneva. Ivory Coast is the world’s biggest cocoa producer.  Cocoa for May delivery fell $33, or 1 percent, to settle

Ivory Coast since the election, according to the  United
Nations . Gbagbo took control of local cocoa and coffee buying
and exports on March 7 in a bid to force resumption of
shipments.  Cocoa Surplus  Global cocoa production will exceed demand by 119,000 tons
