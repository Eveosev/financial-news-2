  Innkeepers USA Trust  asked
permission to sell its bankrupt hotels under a revised deal that
would require competing bidders to pay more than $978.7 million
in cash for its hotels.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in New York today is
considering the so-called stalking-horse offer from Lehman Ali
Inc., a unit of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ; Connecticut-based
asset manager Five Mile Capital Partners LLC; Midland Loan
Services, a division of PNC Bank; and  Apollo Investment Corp. (AINV)   The offer was sweetened a third time overnight to remove a
$7 million breakup fee that would have compensated the stalking-
horse bidders if a higher office was received. Chapman adjourned
a hearing yesterday amid talk that there was other interest in
the company.  “We weren’t apart more than 24 hours, and we already have
$7 million more in value for the estate,” Chapman said.  The offer calls for a $978.7 million bid in order for a
competing bidder to trump the current offer, representing an
$8 million overbid to the deal’s current value, according to
papers circulated in the courtroom and not yet filed.  The case is In re Innkeepers USA Trust, 10-13800,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter for this story:
