OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil
producer, said it remains committed to a strategic partnership
with  BP Plc (BP/)  to tap arctic offshore resources and isn’t
interested in working with BP’s Russian venture TNK-BP instead.  TNK-BP management, led by Chief Executive Officer and
billionaire Russian shareholder  Mikhail Fridman , has sought to
replace BP in its January agreement to explore the Kara Sea and
swap $7.8 billion of its shares with Rosneft, claiming the deal
violates exclusivity agreements.  BP representatives and AAR, the group representing the
billionaire shareholders, will meet at a TNK-BP board meeting
tomorrow in Paris to discuss the proposal. TNK-BP maintains that
it is capable of financing the Arctic exploration.  “Rosneft once again reiterates that it has not and is not
in any talks with AAR or TNK-BP on changing partners in the
project,” Rosneft’s press service said in a  statement  posted on
its website.  A partnership with BP to explore off  Russia ’s Pacific coast
at Sakhalin-4 and Sakhalin-5 has been set outside the boundaries
of the TNK-BP shareholders agreement, Rosneft said in the
statement.  TNK-BP’s board delayed talks on the management proposition
from a March 4 meeting after BP and an independent director
asked for more time to study proposals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
