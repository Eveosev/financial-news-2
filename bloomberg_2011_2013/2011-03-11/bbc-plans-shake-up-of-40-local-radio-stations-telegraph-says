The U.K.’s state-funded British
Broadcasting Corp. plans to cut local programming at its 40
local radio stations, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, citing labor
leaders.  The BBC plans to restrict the local stations to making
breakfast and drivetime programs, with the feed from the
national Radio 5 Live station being transmitted the rest of the
time; Jeremy Dear, general secretary of the National Union of
Journalists, said cutting local programs would “sound the death
knell for local radio,” the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
