Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
tumbled 1.7 percent in Tokyo, extending declines after an 8.9
magnitude earthquake struck northeast of the capital.  Government
bonds  rose and the yen earlier fell to a two-week low.  The Nikkei dropped to 10,254.43, the gauge’s lowest close
since Jan. 31, after a quake shook buildings in the nation’s
financial center and the government issued a tsunami warning.
The broader Topix decreased 1.7 percent to 915.51. Futures on the
Nikkei expiring in June fell as much as 3.8 percent in  Singapore .  The quake struck at 2:46 p.m. local time off the coast of
Sendai north of Tokyo, according to the  Japan Meteorological
Agency .  Kyodo News  said many injuries were reported in Miyagi
prefecture, where a 6-meter (20 feet) tsunami hit and flooded
inland areas 1.5 kilometers from shore, sweeping away cars and
houses, public broadcaster NHK showed on television.  “Our traders kept working through the quake,” said  Ayako Sera , a strategist in Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co.,
which manages about $331 billion in investments. “We were
grabbing the edges of our desks and holding on.”  Japanese government bonds rose, sending the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note down 2.5 basis points to 1.27 percent.  U.S. Treasuries  reversed initial losses, with the yield on the
10-year security falling one basis point to 3.35 percent.  The yen fell to as low as 83.30 versus the dollar, the
lowest level since Feb. 22, before rallying to 82.75 from 82.98
in  New York  yesterday. Japan’s currency strengthened 0.2 percent
to 114.21 per euro from 114.49, having earlier weakened to
115.02.  ‘Inclination to Sell’  “This is obviously bad news and the inclination is to sell
yen,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist at Westpac
Banking Corp. in Sydney. “The yen is a safe haven itself and
the fact that Japan runs a current-account surplus means there’s
a possibility that, if this is very serious, Japan might keep
more of its money at home,” trimming declines, he said.  The Nikkei dropped 4.1 percent for the week, the steepest
decline since July as an escalating conflict between rebels and
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  sparked concern that rising oil
prices will hinder the recovery. Stocks also fell as economic
data in the U.S. showed the recovery may be slowing and a
campaign finance scandal roiled Japan’s ruling party.    Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s No.1 carmaker, fell 1.5
percent to 3,595 yen. Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest exporter of
electronics, declined 2.2 percent to 2,806 yen. Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., the country’s largest publicly traded
lender, dropped 2.5 percent to 431 yen.  While all 33 index groups on the Topix index declined,
construction companies fell the least as traders snapped up
shares ahead of what may be an expensive rebuilding process for
Japan. Fukuda Corp., a general contractor based in the Northern
prefecture of Niigata, surged 30 percent to 213 yen in the
minutes following the quake. Ueki Corp., another builder in the
prefecture, jumped 23 percent to 165 yen.  “Even as the office was shaking violently, the traders
were buying up shares of builders,” said Sumitomo Trust’s Sera.
“The question is: how much will the rebuilding cost?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
