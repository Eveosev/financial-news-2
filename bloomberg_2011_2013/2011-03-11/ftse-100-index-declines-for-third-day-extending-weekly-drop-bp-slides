U.K. stocks fell for a third day,
dragging the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  toward the biggest weekly drop since
July, as an earthquake struck Japan and Chinese inflation
exceeded forecasts.    BP Plc (BP/)  and  BG Group Plc (BG/)  led losses on the FTSE 100.  FirstGroup Plc (FGP)  sank 4.5 percent after the Aberdeen, Scotland-
based company said the trading environment for its First Student
school-bus unit “remains challenging.”  The benchmark FTSE 100 retreated 18.87, or 0.3 percent, to
5,826.42 at 8:41 a.m. in London, bringing this week’s decline to
2.7 percent. The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  dropped 0.4 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index lost 0.7 percent.  The FTSE 100 has surged 66 percent since the equity market
rally began two years ago, as the global economy recovered from
recession and corporate earnings rebounded. Still, the gauge has
fallen 4.4 percent from this year’s high on Feb. 8 as  oil prices 
jumped amid fighting in Libya between pro-democracy protesters
and forces loyal to the country’s ruler of the last 41 years,
Muammar Qaddafi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
