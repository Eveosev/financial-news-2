Wheat headed for the biggest weekly
drop in more than two years in  Chicago  after the U.S.
unexpectedly raised its global supply estimate. Rice and corn
also declined on forecasts for bigger supplies.  Global wheat inventories will total 181.9 million metric
tons at the end of the marketing year on May 31, up 2.3 percent
from last month’s estimate, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
 said  yesterday. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast
stockpiles would decline to 177.56 million tons. Corn and rice
inventory estimates also climbed.  “The USDA pointed to inventory stabilization, with small
inventory builds for most crops,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analyst Damien Courvalin said in a report. “We believe that
this stabilization will put a lid on crop prices in the short
term. With the market focus shifting to the likely 2011-2012
supply response, we actually see downside risk to crop prices in
the near term.”  Wheat for May delivery slid 14 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$7.265 a bushel at 10:06 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The grain is down 13 percent this week, on course for
the biggest decline since December 2008.  The agency’s announcement “was bearish for wheat prices,”  Luke Mathews , a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia ,
said in an e-mailed report today. “Continued Middle East and
North Africa violence and the stronger dollar compounded losses
in the wheat pit.”  Milling wheat for May delivery lost 2.8 percent to 220
euros ($303.29) a ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris, retreating for a
10th day in a row.  Momentum Shifts  Libyan national leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s son Saif al-Islam
Qaddafi said government forces are mounting a full-scale attack
on rebels. The momentum has shifted to Qaddafi’s forces, two top
U.S. intelligence officials said.  Unrest in the Middle East may prompt speculators to exit
the grain market as they move to less risky assets, sustaining
losses in prices,  Michael Pitts , a commodity sales director at
National Australia Bank Ltd., said by phone from Sydney today.  Rice for May delivery declined 42.5 cents, or 3.3 percent,
to $12.625 per 100 pounds in Chicago after reaching $12.55, the
lowest price since October. The grain has declined 11 percent
this week, the most since May 2008.  Global rice stockpiles may rise to an eight-year high of
98.8 million tons, according to the USDA’s estimate yesterday.
The department raised its inventory  estimate  from 93.854 million
tons in January.  Rice Demand  The USDA  cut  its outlook for the global harvest to 451.5
million tons and pared its estimate on demand, while raising a
forecast on stockpiles in China and  India , the world’s two
largest growers. That would put the global supply balance in
surplus, compared with a forecast deficit last month.  Corn for May delivery fell 9.75 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
$6.73 a bushel, on course for a 7.6 percent slide this week, the
biggest since November.  The USDA raised its global corn inventory  estimate  to 123.1
million tons, from 122.5 million tons last month, on bigger
harvests in  Brazil .  Concern that supplies would tighten amid rising demand
helped fuel a rally in crop prices as corn, wheat and rice
jumped this year to the highest levels since 2008. The gains
boosted global food costs to a record last month after a 25
percent jump last year, according to the  United Nations .  May-delivery soybeans declined 16.5 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $13.39 a bushel, set for a 5.3 percent drop this week. That
would be the biggest weekly decline since November for the
oilseed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
