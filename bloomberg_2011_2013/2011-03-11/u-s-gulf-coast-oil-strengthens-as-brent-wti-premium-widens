U.S. Gulf crude gained against West  Texas  Intermediate as Brent oil’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
strengthened for the third consecutive day.  The gap between April-delivery WTI futures and Brent, its
European counterpart, widened 3 cents to $12.76 at 2:16 p.m. in  New York . The differential reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against Brent.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI widened 35 cents to $8.75 a barrel, while
Poseidon strengthened 55 cents to $8.75, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg at 2 p.m. in New York.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium gained 75 cents to $8 a
barrel. Thunder Horse strengthened $1.40 cents to $13 a barrel.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 30 cents to $3.90 a
barrel. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI strengthened 50
cents to $14.50 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium
widened 25 cents to $15.25.  Syncrude’s premium strengthened $3 to $15 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select
widened 50 cents to $21 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
