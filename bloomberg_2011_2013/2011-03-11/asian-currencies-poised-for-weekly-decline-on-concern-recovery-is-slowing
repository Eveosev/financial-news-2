Asian currencies fell this week,
led by  South Korea ’s won and the Philippine peso, as a major
earthquake in Japan spurred demand for dollars and yen, while
signs the global recovery is losing steam deterred risk-taking.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, declined
0.2 percent for the week. An 8.9-magnitude earthquake yesterday,
the strongest ever recorded in Japan, prompted a slump in
regional stocks. Overseas investors sold $2.8 billion more South
Korean and Taiwanese stocks than they bought this week, exchange
data show. The yen strengthened the most since Dec. 3 on safe-
haven demand.  “The impact from the earthquake could result in slower
external trade as Japan is traditionally one of the top three
markets for Asian exporters,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a
currency strategist at CIMB Investment Bank in  Kuala Lumpur .
“Also, if growth in China cools off further, it could chip away
some of the recent gains in Asian currencies.”  South Korea’s won dropped 0.9 percent from a week earlier
to 1,124.18 against the dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Philippine peso slipped 0.9 percent to 43.65.
Taiwan’s dollar and  India ’s rupee each fell almost 0.5 percent
to NT$29.599 and 45.1825, respectively.  “The earthquake raised concern some economic activities
will be halted in Japan,” said  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and
currency trader at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo yesterday.
Sony Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Canon Inc. are among
companies that suspended production in factories affected by the
temblor.  Faltering Global Growth  Reports on March 10 showed U.S. jobless claims rose,  China 
had its first monthly trade deficit in almost a year and Moody’s
Investors Service cut Spain’s credit rating. Crude oil reached a
29-month high on March 7 as a civil war in  Libya  disrupted
supplies and  Saudi Arabia  quelled protests.  First-time claims for jobless benefits rose to 397,000 in
the week ended March 5 from a revised 371,000 the previous week,
the U.S. Labor Department said. China posted a trade deficit of
$7.3 billion in February, compared with the median forecast for
a $4.9 billion surplus in a Bloomberg survey.  China and the U.S. are the biggest markets for exports from
the region. Overseas shipments account for about half of South
Korea’s economy and two-thirds of  Thailand  and  Taiwan ’s gross
domestic product. China’s yuan fell 0.1 percent this week to
6.5746.  Oil Pressure  Malaysia’s ringgit dropped to its lowest level since March
2 after the central bank held its overnight policy rate at 2.75
percent for a fourth straight meetings, a decision predicted by
16 of 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Four had expected a
25-basis point increase.  Bank Negara doubled the statutory reserve ratio to 2
percent, requiring banks to set aside zero-interest money with
the central bank from April 1, to tighten credit. It had slashed
the ratio to 1 percent in March 2009 from 4 percent in November
2008 after the global credit-market crisis.  The currency declined 0.6 percent on the week to 3.0460 per
dollar, the biggest drop in a month.  Oil prices fell 3.1 percent to $101.16 a barrel in  New York ,
paring its rally over the past three weeks to 15 percent. The
price reached $106.95 on March 7, the highest level since
September 2008.  “Traders are more concerned about a sell-off in the
equities markets in  Asia , with the supply of oil potentially
being disrupted in Saudi Arabia,” said Godwin Chan, a foreign-
exchange trader at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.  Elsewhere, the  Singapore  dollar fell 0.5 percent for the
week to S$1.2736 against its U.S. counterpart, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Indonesia’s rupiah depreciated 0.2
percent to 8,803 while Thailand’s baht gained 0.1 percent to
30.46.  To contact the reporter on this story:
