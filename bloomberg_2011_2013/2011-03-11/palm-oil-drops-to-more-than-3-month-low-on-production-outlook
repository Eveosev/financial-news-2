  Palm oil  fell to the lowest level
in more than three months on forecasts that output and reserves
in Malaysia, the second-largest producer, will rise this year.  The May-delivery contract shed 2.8 percent to 3,364 ringgit
($1,121) a metric ton, the lowest close since Nov. 26. Futures
slumped 8.1 percent this week, the most since the period ended
Dec. 5, 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Malaysia will see output expanding to 17.6 million tons
this year from 17 million tons in 2010, as yields improve, the
Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok
said March 8. Prices reached a 35-month high of 3,967 ringgit on
Feb. 10 as excess rainfall brought on by a La Nina weather event
curbed output in  Malaysia  and  Indonesia , the top producers.  “We expect production to rise from here, starting with a
strong 22 percent month-on-month increase in March as fresh
fruit bunch yields recover,”  Ben Santoso , a plantation analyst
at HwangDBS Vickers Research Sdn., said in a report today.  Palm oil has fallen 14.4 percent since Feb. 10 and is
expected to trade at 3,350 ringgit to 3,750 ringgit in the next
two to three weeks, said Donny Khor, senior vice president for
futures & options at OSK Investment Bank Bhd. Prices will come
“under pressure” amid forecasts for higher output and the
expectation of a better soybean crop in Latin America, he said.  World soybean inventories before the next Northern
Hemisphere harvests will be larger than forecast in February
because of increased production from  Brazil , the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said yesterday. Palm and soybean oils are
substitutes for food and fuel uses.  ‘Strong Recovery’  Malaysia will see a “strong recovery” in production in
the second half, producing an estimated 17.3 million tons this
year, and Indonesian output will be 24 million tons,  Dorab
Mistry , director at Godrej International Ltd., said March 9.  Production in February climbed 3.5 percent to 1,094,473
tons, the first gain after three months of declines. Stockpiles
advanced 4.2 percent to 1,478,793 tons, while exports fell 8.5
percent to 1,114,202 tons, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said
yesterday. Output in January fell to the lowest level in four
years, the board said last month.  Malaysia’s palm oil prices are now in a downcycle that will
last six to nine months,according to OSK Research Sdn.  “Demand has been weakening partly because of high prices,
which allowed inventory to build up,” Alvin Tai, an analyst at
OSK, wrote in a report today. “Prices have to correct to a
level where demand starts to kick in.”  Soybean oil for May delivery shed as much as 1.9 percent to
55.86 cents a pound in  Chicago  and traded at 55.87 cents at 6:33
p.m. in  Singapore . Soybeans for delivery in the same month fell
as much as 1.6 percent to $13.34 a bushel and traded at $13.35
at 4:14 p.m.  September-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  fell 0.7 percent to close at 9,168 yuan ($1,397).
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month shed 0.4 percent to
10,006 yuan at the close. CME Group Inc.’s most-active June
palm-oil contract, pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price,
dropped 2.3 percent to $1,127.25 at 3:01 p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
