Guinness Nigeria Plc, the local
unit of  Diageo Plc (DGE) , plans to spend 52 billion naira ($335.8
million) on expanding brewing capacity in the country this year,
Managing Director Devlin Hainsworth said.  “We’re lifting capacity of two existing plants in Ikeja
and  Benin ,” he told reporters today in Abuja, the capital.  The expansion project will create about 2,000 jobs and it
is expected to be complete before December, Hainsworth said.  The brewer’s Harp lager brand has taken market share from
Star, which is produced by Nigerian Breweries Plc, CSL said in a
research note dated Oct. 4. Sales volumes for Harp more than
doubled in the first half of 2010 and crossed the 1 million-
hectoliter mark for the first time in the second half, CSL said.  The stock closed unchanged at 195 naira by 2:30 p.m. in
Lagos. The shares have gained 2.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
