The condition of Ukraine’s winter
grains was little changed as of yesterday compared with a week
earlier, the country’s Agriculture Ministry said.  The proportion of winter grains deemed to be in good
condition was 56 percent of the 8.09 million hectares (19.98
million acres) sown, the same as a week ago, the ministry said
today in a  statement  on its website. Weak plants were also
unchanged at 6 percent.  The wheat crop was in good condition on 57.1 percent of the
planted area, or 6.55 million hectares, compared with 57.2
percent at March 3, the ministry said.  The condition of the barley crop was unchanged, with 47.1
percent of plants in good condition and 44.5 percent in a
satisfactory state. Weak barley plants covered 105,200 hectares,
or 8.4 percent of the planted area.  Rapeseed was classified as being in good condition on 52
percent of a total 1.08 million hectares, compared with 52.1
percent a week earlier. Satisfactory rapeseed plants were the
same as a week ago, at 39.6 percent. Weak rapeseed plants
accounted for 8.4 percent of the planted area, or 90,500
hectares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
