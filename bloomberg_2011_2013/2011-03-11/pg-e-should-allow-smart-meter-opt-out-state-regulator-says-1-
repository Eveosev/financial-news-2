  PG&E Corp. (PCG) , owner of  California ’s
largest utility, was ordered by state regulators to propose a
way for customers to have the option of not getting a so-called
smart meter installed at their homes.  PG&E must issue its proposal that will allow for “some
form of opt-out” within two weeks, California Public Utilities
Commission President Michael Peevey said today in an e-mail
statement. The directive is designed to address concerns raised
by some about the potential health effects of the wireless radio
frequency emissions from the devices, Peevey said.  PG&E has been looking at possible alternatives for those
who may not want a wireless meter and is “prepared to file a
proposal by the deadline,” Paul Moreno, a company spokesman,
said in a telephone interview. “Although the great weight of
scientific evidence demonstrates that radio frequency from smart
meters is safe, we take our customer concerns seriously.”  PG&E, based in  San Francisco , is spending about $2.2
billion to install 9.8 million meters by 2012, Moreno said. The
utility has installed 7.7 million meters so far, he said.  Customers who opt out of the program should pay to do so at
“a reasonable cost,” Peevey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
