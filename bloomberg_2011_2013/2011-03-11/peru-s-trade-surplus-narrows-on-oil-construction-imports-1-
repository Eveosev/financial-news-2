Peru’s  trade surplus  narrowed in
January after higher prices boosted crude oil imports and
economic growth spurred demand for construction materials and
cars.  The Andean country posted a $234 million trade surplus in
January, compared with a $1.1 billion surplus in December and
$438 million a year ago, the country’s National Statistics
Institute said in an e-mailed report.  Imports jumped 31 percent to $2.62 billion from a year
earlier, the agency said. Exports climbed 17 percent to $2.85
billion after gold, silver and tin prices rose.  December’s trade surplus was the widest in three years.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7685 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:597 a.m. in New York, from 2.7664 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
