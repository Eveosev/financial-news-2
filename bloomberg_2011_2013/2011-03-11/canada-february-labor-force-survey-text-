Following is the text of  Canada 's
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Employment edged up in February (+15,000), bringing
total gains over the past three months to 115,000. The
unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.8%. Over the
past 12 months, employment has risen by 1.9% (+322,000).  Part-time employment rose by 39,000 in February, partly
offset by a decline in full-time work. Over the past 12
months, part-time employment has grown by 5.1% (+166,000),
while full time increased by 1.1% (+156,000).  There were small gains spread across a number of
industries in February, led by health care and social
assistance, and accommodation and food services. At the
same time, there were declines in business, building and
other support services and in public administration.  In February, the number of self-employed workers
increased by 26,000, while the number of private sector
employees edged down and public sector employment changed
little. Over the past 12 months, however, self-employment
edged down 0.6%, while the pace of growth for private
sector employees matched that of the public sector
(+2.4%).  Alberta was the only province with a notable employment
gain in February, up 14,000. At the same time, employment
declined in Saskatchewan (-3,300). There was little change
in all other provinces.  Employment for youths aged 15 to 24 increased by 16,000
in February. There was little change for the other major
demographic groups.  Employment up slightly in health care and social
assistance and accommodation and food services  The number of health care and social assistance workers
rose by 18,000 in February, following a similar increase
the month before. This brought employment growth in the
industry to 87,000 (+4.3%) over the past 12 months.  In February, there was also an increase in the number
of workers in accommodation and food services (+15,000).
Despite this increase, employment in this industry has
fallen by 44,000 over the past 12 months.  Following sizeable gains at the end of 2010,
manufacturing employment held steady over the first two
months of 2011. Employment in the industry was up 2.9%
(+50,000) from February 2010.  Employment in business, building and other support
services decreased by 35,000 in February, offsetting an
increase of similar magnitude the month before. This
leaves employment in the industry at about the same level
as a year ago.  Employment in public administration was down by 14,000
in February, offsetting most of the increase in January.
Despite this decline, the number of workers in public
administration has grown by 38,000 since February 2010.  More workers in Alberta  Employment in Alberta increased for the second
consecutive month, up 14,000 in February. As a result, the  unemployment rate  edged down by 0.2 percentage points to
5.7%.  Compared with February 2010, when Alberta was near its
employment-low following the labour market downturn,
employment has grown by 3.4% (+68,000), well above the
national rate of 1.9%. Several industries contributed to
the year-over-year growth for the province, including
manufacturing, natural resources, and professional,
scientific and technical services.  Following an increase of 78,000 over the previous three
months, employment in Ontario edged down in February. The
unemployment rate also edged down to 8.0%, the result of
fewer people participating in the labour force. The number
of workers in Ontario has risen by 2.1% (+138,000) over
the past 12 months.  Employment in  Quebec  was little changed in February,
leaving employment growth in the province over the past 12
months at 2.2% (+86,000). The unemployment rate in
February was 7.7%.  While there was little employment change in British
Columbia in February, the unemployment rate for the
province increased 0.6 percentage points to 8.8%, the
result of more people entering the labour force in search
of work.  Saskatchewan was the only province with a notable
decline in employment in February, down 3,300. While this
pushed the unemployment rate in the province up 0.3
percentage points to 5.7%, it remained among the lowest in
the country. The decline in the number of workers leaves
employment in the province at the same level observed in
February 2010.  Youth employment rises in February  The number of employed 15- to 24- year-olds increased
by 16,000 in February, all in part-time work. Their
unemployment rate edged down to 14.3%. Over the past 12
months, employment for youths has risen by 1.1% (+26,000).  In February, there was little employment change among
men and women aged 25 to 54 and 55 and over. Compared with
12 months earlier, employment growth was fastest among
women aged 55 and over (+8.0%), followed by men in the
same age group (+4.6%). Over the same period, men aged 25
to 54 experienced growth of 2.0%, while employment for
women in that same age group was unchanged.  Note to readers  Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample, and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will
have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates, and how to use standard errors

seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
