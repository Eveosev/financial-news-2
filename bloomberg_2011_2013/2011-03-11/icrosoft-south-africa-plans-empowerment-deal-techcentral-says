  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s South African
unit will soon announce a 472 million rand ($68.3 million) deal
to invest in between five and 10 black-owned software
development companies,  TechCentral  said, citing unidentified
sources.  Like many U.S. companies operating in  South Africa ,
Microsoft hasn’t been able to sell a stake in its operations in
the country to black shareholders because of regulatory
restrictions, the Johannesburg-based online news service
reported.  The department of trade and industry and Microsoft worked
on the plan to boost the company’s credentials on increasing the
participation of black people in the economy, TechCentral said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
