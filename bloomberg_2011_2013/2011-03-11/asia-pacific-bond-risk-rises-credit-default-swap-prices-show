The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1 basis point to 110
basis points as of 10:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to Nomura
Holdings Inc. Itâ€™s on track for its highest close since Feb. 23,
prices from data provider CMA in New York show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 1.5 basis points to 109 basis
points as of 8:40 a.m. in  Hong Kong , the highest since March 2,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 98.5 as
of 9:19 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
