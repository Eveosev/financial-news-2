Witopia Inc., whose Internet
service allows users to circumvent Chinese government censors,
said it’s receiving a surge in customer complaints about
technical difficulties in the country.  The company is recommending users to report problems via e-
mail instead of its live support service because of an
“extraordinary volume from  China  shenanigans,” according to a
Witopia posting on its website today.  Witopia and other providers of virtual private networks, or
VPNs, allow subscribers to anonymously surf blocked websites by
employing private proxy servers that encrypt data. China has the
world’s most censored Internet market, according to Herdict.org,
a project of  Harvard University  that tracks reports of Web
outages.  Witopia, located in Reston, Virgina, didn’t immediately
return calls and e-mails to its press office. Li Wufeng, chief
of the Information Office Internet Affairs Bureau of China’s
ruling State Council, said services offered in China must be
provided by licensed operators and there have never been any
issues involving the access of legitimate VPN services that are
used by companies to enhance security.  China, which bans pornography, gambling and content
critical of the ruling Communist Party, blocks websites run by
Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube.  While VPNs are mainly used by companies to give employees
secured access to corporate networks, they can also allow users
to access blocked sites and help enable individuals outside of
the U.S. to watch geographically restricted services such as
Hulu LLC’s online videos.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
