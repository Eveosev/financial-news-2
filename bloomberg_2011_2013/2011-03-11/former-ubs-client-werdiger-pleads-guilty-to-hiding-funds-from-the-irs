Richard Werdiger, a former  UBS AG (UBSN) 
client, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service by hiding more than $7.1 million in the
Swiss bank.  Werdiger, 63, pleaded guilty in a hearing in  Manhattan 
federal court today, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a
statement. As part of the guilty plea, Werdiger agreed to pay a
$3.5 million civil penalty.  Werdiger was one of seven former UBS AG clients accused of
hiding more than $100 million from U.S. tax authorities in
offshore accounts. The charges were part of an IRS crackdown on
offshore  tax evasion .  Werdiger faces as many as 20 years in prison when he’s
sentenced June 14, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office.  Prosecutors claimed that from 1986 to 2000, Werdiger opened
three UBS accounts through sham entities in Panama and
Liechtenstein, and communicated with the Zurich-based bank using
the code name “Trygon.” By 2003, his accounts totaled $7
million, according to the government.  UBS avoided U.S. prosecution in 2009 by paying $780
million, turning over the names of U.S. account holders and
admitting that it helped Americans hide assets from the IRS.  The case is U.S. v. Werdiger, 10-cr-325, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
