  Posco (005490) , South Korea’s largest
steelmaker, may increase its involvement in the A$4.3 billion
($4.3 billion) iron ore rail and port development at Oakajee in
Western Australia, state Premier  Colin Barnett  said.  “Posco has always been a participant in Western
Australia,” Barnett told Perth radio station 6PR in an
interview from South Korea today. “They may increase their
involvement in Oakajee, something that I would encourage.”    Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and  Murchison Metals Ltd. (MMX) , the joint
venture partners in Oakajee, were given on March 2 an extra nine
months by Barnett’s government to decide whether to build the
infrastructure that will open up exports of the steel-making
ingredient from the state’s mid-west region. Investors from
other Asian nations, including  China , could be brought in to
financially bolster the project, Barnett had earlier said.  Perth-based Murchison, in which Posco owns a 13.9 percent
stake, said separately today there is potential for “closer
cooperation” with the South Korean company.  “The potential for closer co-operation with one of the
world’s premier steel producers is obviously something we
regularly discuss with them as part of our business execution
strategy,” Murchison’s Executive Chairman Paul Kopejtka said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The terminal project near Geraldton, 430 kilometers (267
miles) north of Perth, will have the capacity to export 45
million metric tons of iron ore a year, Murchison said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
