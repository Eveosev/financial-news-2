  Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) ,
the lender raising cash to repay Austrian state aid, aims to
sell its eastern European unit by June, Austrian daily newspaper  Der Standard  reported.  OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank, is the only outside
bidder for Volksbanken’s VBI unit, Der Standard said, citing
sources close to the government. VBI co-owner Groupe BPCE may
buy out Volksbanken and  Germany ’s DZ Bank if the sale to
Sberbank fails, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
