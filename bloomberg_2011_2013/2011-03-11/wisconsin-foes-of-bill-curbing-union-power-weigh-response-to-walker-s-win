Drum-pounding, pro-labor
demonstrators marched around the  Wisconsin  Capitol well into the
night, carrying signs that read “Rebellion” and “We’re Not
Licked” after lawmakers passed curbs on government unions.  Hours after the Assembly gave final approval yesterday to a
bill that limits collective bargaining to wages for most
government workers, though, it was clear to some that a sea
change had occurred.  Michael Lipp, president of the teachers union in the state
capital, Madison Teachers Inc., said he usually gets about 120
calls every Thursday in a regular discussion about retirement.  “Those numbers have gone up by another 100 to 120 in each
of the last three Thursdays,” Lipp said in a telephone
interview. “I see a huge bubble coming.”  Governor  Scott Walker  says he’ll sign the bill into law as
soon as he legally can. The Republican said restrictions on
collective bargaining will give local governments flexibility to
curb costs. Last week, Walker unveiled a two-year budget
proposal that seeks $3.4 billion in cuts and savings to help
close a $3.6 billion gap.  The Assembly debate preceding the vote helped define the
three-week fight in Wisconsin as a battle over the pay and
benefits of government workers compared with those in industry.  Republican Assemblyman Robin Vos of Rochester said public
employees deserve good-paying jobs, health care and pensions.  State’s Unemployed  “But you know what I think about?” Vos said in a floor
speech. “About the same number of people, about 175,000 people,
who over the course of the past two years have lost their good-
paying jobs, they lost their health insurance in many cases, and
they lost their retirement and have had to spend those days
trying to figure out how to make ends meet.”  Democrats called the bill a breach of trust and a rollback
of 50 years of employment law in the state.  “This is disgraceful and you all know it,” said
Assemblywoman Tamara Grigsby, a  Milwaukee  Democrat. “And you’re
going to pay a price for it.”  Unions may be the first to pay. The Wisconsin bill “could
spell the beginning of the end of public-sector unions,” said
former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who now teaches public
policy at the  University of California , Berkeley.  Unless the bill is nullified, either in the courts or
through voter recalls of Republican senators, it will embolden
governors in other states to push similar legislation, Reich
said by e-mail.  Workers’ Costs Rise  The bill, which exempts police and firefighters, would
require annual recertification votes for union representation
and would make the payment of dues voluntary. State workers
would contribute 5.8 percent of their salary toward pensions and
pay 12.6 percent of their health-insurance costs.  When the measure passed the Assembly yesterday 53-42, the
spectators’ gallery erupted with people shaking their fists and
chanting, “Shame, shame, shame.” Hours after the vote,
demonstrations continued inside and outside the Capitol, where
thousands had gathered earlier in the day to protest the bills.  “This is a stain on our democracy,” Assembly Minority
Leader Peter Barca, a Kenosha Democrat, said in a floor speech.
“It is a stain so deep that I don’t know that it can ever be
removed.”  Locked-Down Capitol  Before the vote, the Capitol was temporarily locked down,
preventing Assembly members from getting in. It delayed the
start of the day’s session by three hours.  “I know that you feel passionate that this is going to
ruin Wisconsin,” said Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, a Republican
from Horicon. “That’s simply not true.”  The Ohio Senate passed a bill last week aimed at limiting
collective bargaining for government employees. The proposals in
both states incited protests across the U.S. and sparked debate
about concessions by government unions as governors face
combined budget gaps projected at more than $100 billion in the
next fiscal year.  The bill in Wisconsin and similar legislation under
consideration in  Indiana  would limit the political influence of
public-worker unions by reducing the amount of money they can
contribute to candidates and parties, said Paul Beck, who
teaches politics at  Ohio State University  in Columbus.  “It obviously changes the balance of power in the campaign
playing field and tilts it in the direction of big individual
donors and corporations,” Beck said in a telephone interview.  Wisconsin stands in contrast to “other states where
they’re cutting billions of dollars from aid to schools and
local governments,” Walker, 43, said in a press briefing
yesterday in Milwaukee. Those states aren’t providing local
officials with tools to avoid “massive” layoffs or property-
tax increases, said the first-term governor. Walker won election
in November as Republicans gained control of the Legislature.  ‘Moral Compass’  “I’m enraged,” said Becky Jenn, a speech pathologist from
Madison who doesn’t belong to a union. “I’m horrified by the
broken moral compass this shows.”  Walker “energized the populace,” AFL-CIO President  Richard Trumka  said yesterday in  Washington . His federation of
unions, with 12.2 million members, is considering a challenge,
he said.  Barca, the Democratic leader, asked the district attorney
of  Dane County , where Madison is located, to investigate and
reverse the Senate vote. Lawmakers violated Wisconsin law by
failing to give 24 hours notice of the March 9 session, he said
yesterday in a complaint filed with the prosecutor, Ismael R.
Ozanne.  He was informed of the session to consider the bill less
than two hours before the Senate convened, Barca said.  U.S. Poll  Americans reject Republican efforts to scale back benefits
for government workers, 49 percent to 46 percent, a Bloomberg
National Poll said this week. The March 4-7 telephone survey of
1,001 U.S. adults had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1
percentage points. Almost two-thirds said public employees
should have the right to bargain collectively for wages.  States shouldn’t be able to break promises to retirees,
according to 63 percent of those polled. Forty-nine percent said
governors trying to cut public-employee benefits are aiming to
balance their budgets, while 43 percent said the purpose was to
weaken the political power of unions.  The survey was conducted by Selzer & Co., based in  Des
Moines ,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
