The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate bonds rose, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 5 basis
points to 397, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at 8
a.m. in  London . The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and an increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1.25 basis points to 104.5,
JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25
banks and insurers rose 2.75 to 166 and the subordinated index
was 3 higher at 283.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
