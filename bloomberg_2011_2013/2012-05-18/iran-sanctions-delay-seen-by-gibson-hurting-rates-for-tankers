E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd.  comments
today in an e-mailed report on how the market for very large
crude carriers hauling 2 million-barrel cargoes of oil will
react to sanctions against  Iran .  A European Union embargo on buying, financing, transporting
and insuring Iranian oil aimed at pressuring the country over
its nuclear ambitions takes effect July 1. The  International
Atomic Energy Agency  will meet May 21 with Iran to discuss the
program.  “If the meeting next week brings some more positive news,
it appears to be in everyone’s economic interests to delay the
sanctions. However, it will have a major negative impact on the
crude tanker markets, primarily VLCCs.  “Firstly, it will open the door for a greater utilization
of the Iranian tanker fleet in the international trade, adding
more fresh supply to an already overtonnaged market. At the same
time, it is likely to push  oil prices  to lower levels.  “Although initially shipowners will benefit from lower
bunker prices, in the longer run it will result in a reduction
in crude output by Middle East OPEC producers (excluding Iran).  “However, if there is no agreement and further sanctions
are implemented from July 1, VLCC rates are likely to increase
significantly, with uncertainty surrounding tankers that load at
Iranian terminals and the inability of Iranian tonnage to trade
internationally. Also, more OPEC crude will be needed to ease
the upward pressure in oil prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
