Variable annuity sales in the U.S.
fell for a second-straight quarter as  MetLife Inc. (MET)  limited
offerings of the product to reduce risk.  Total sales dropped 7 percent to $36.8 billion in the first
three months of 2012 from a year earlier, trade group Limra said
today on its  website . MetLife, the top seller in 2011, generated
$4.93 billion and  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  had $4.94 billion.  MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, has been scaling
back to reduce risks from stock market declines. The New York-
based firm said on April 27 that first-quarter sales fell 13
percent. The equity-linked annuities can provide guaranteed
minimum income to customers regardless of market performance and
lead to losses for insurers when stocks fall.  “We are still seeing companies carefully manage the
risks” of guaranteeing investment gains, Joseph Montminy,
Limra’s assistant vice president, annuity research, said in a
statement.  MetLife has been offering lower returns on new offerings
and said it expects full-year sales of about $18 billion after
topping $28 billion in 2011.  “Our expectation is that the product and pricing actions
we have taken will result in sales within the target range,”
MetLife Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian  said April 27
on a conference call.  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , the bailed-out insurer,
posted variable annuity sales of $2.25 billion, a 21 percent
increase, while sales of fixed annuities fell by more than half
to $1.07 billion, according to Limra.  “We are concerned about fixed annuities,” AIG CEO  Robert Benmosche  said on a May 4 conference call. “We don’t want to
build a large book at low interest rates.”  Industrywide, fixed annuity sales fell 10 percent to $18
billion, Limra said. Total annuity sales slid 8 percent to $54.8
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
