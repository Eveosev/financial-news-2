(Corrects headline and first paragraph to show that Moody’s
outlook is conditional.)  Plans by  TVN SA (TVN) , Poland’s second-
largest television broadcaster, to sell its Internet unit Onet
and use the proceeds to repay debt would be “credit positive,”
Christian Azzi, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service analyst,
said by phone from London today.  TVN’s sale of Onet “makes sense” as it’s not part of the
company’s core business, Azzi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
