A draft law being debated in  Turkey ’s
parliament would allow employers to fire staff without severance
pay if they drink alcohol,  Radikal newspaper  reported.  The draft changes the wording of an existing law that says
employees may be fired for showing up to work “drunk” to allow
firing for coming to work “having taken alcoholic drinks”
Radikal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
