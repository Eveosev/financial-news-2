Asian  stocks  fell, with a regional
index posting its worst week in almost eight months, as Europe’s
debt crisis worsened, U.S. economic data missed estimates and
Chinese home prices and investment declined.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , a consumer-electronics maker that
gets about 35 percent of sales from Europe and America, sank 11
percent in South Korea.  Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) ,
China’s second-biggest developer by sales volume, plunged 16
percent in Hong Kong after China’s home prices slid in a record
number of mainland cities during April.  Hokuetsu Kishu Paper (3865)  Co.
dropped 14 percent in Tokyo after forecasting a decline in
profit.  “Investor sentiment is at its worst,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co., which
oversees the equivalent of about $23.8 billion. “We don’t know
what will happen with Greece, and when something does happen, we
don’t know what impact that will have. All people can do is
escape from risks, a so-called panic.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Japan Index (MXAP)  declined 5.1 percent to
112.58 this week, wiping out this year’s gains. That’s the
steepest weekly slide since the week ended Sept. 23.  Almost $4 trillion has been wiped from global equity
markets this month as Greece’s failure to form a government
rekindled Europe’s debt crisis and signs of slowing economic
growth in China and U.S. damped the outlook for global demand.  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 2.1 percent this
week after the nation’s home prices fell from a year earlier in
April in a record 46 of 70 cities tracked by the government as
officials pledged to keep restrictions on property purchases
that have sapped buyer demand. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index sank
5.1 percent.  Topix Losing Streak  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  decreased 3.8 percent this
week. The broader Topix Index fell 4.3 percent, led by
papermakers, capping the longest streak of weekly losses since
the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  retreated 5.6 percent; South
Korea’s Kospi Index lost 7 percent this week.  Banco Santander SA was among 16 Spanish banks whose credit
ratings were cut by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited
economic weakness and the government’s mounting budget strain.
Greece’s credit rating was downgraded one level by  Fitch Ratings 
on concerns the country won’t be able to muster the political
support needed to sustain its membership in the euro area.  Esprit Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong-listed clothier that gets
most of its revenue from  Europe  plunged 17 percent to HK$12.56.
 Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , a port operator controlled by
billionaire  Li Ka-Shing  that gets about half its sales in the
debt-stricken region, dropped 6.4 percent.  Samsung, James Hardie  Samsung dropped 11 percent to 1,166,000 won in Seoul. James
Hardie Industries SE, a seller of home siding that counts the
U.S. as its biggest market, dropped 2.8 percent to A$7.05.  In the U.S., economic reports showed jobless claims
unexpectedly stagnated at 370,000 in the week ended May 12 and
the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index fell to minus 43.6, a level
associated with recessions or their aftermaths.  Evergrande Real Estate sank 16 percent to HK$3.66 in  Hong
Kong  this week amid further signs that China’s efforts to cool
its economy are crimping demand for property.  China Overseas
Land and Investment Ltd. , a developer controlled by the nation’s
construction ministry, lost 8.1 percent to HK$14.80.  Among other stocks that fell, Hokuetsu Kishu Paper
plummeted 14 percent to 413 yen this week after saying net
income will fall 41 percent to 7.5 billion yen ($95 million) in
the year ending March 31, citing expectations for a strong yen,
high oil prices and power shortages.  Toll, STX  Ship operator STX Pan Ocean Co. plunged 29 percent to 4,200
won this week in Seoul on speculation the sale of offshore
vessel-maker STX OSV Holdings Ltd. may be delayed, hindering the
group’s effort to pare debts. STX Pan Ocean declined the most in
the MSCI Asia Index, followed by  Toll Holdings Ltd. (TOL)   Toll Holdings, Australia’s largest trucking company,
tumbled 23 percent to A$4.31 in Sydney this week, after
forecasting full-year profit as much as 11 percent below
analysts’ estimates.  Shares in the Asia-Pacific gauge, which includes companies
from some  emerging markets , trade for 11.48 times estimated
earnings, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with 12.33 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 and 9.95 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
