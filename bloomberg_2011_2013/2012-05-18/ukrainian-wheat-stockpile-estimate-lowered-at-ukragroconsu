Ukraine will have 7.5 million metric
tons of wheat in carryover inventories when the coming crop year
begins on July 1, less than predicted a month ago though still a
record high, UkrAgroConsult said.  The estimate is 400,000 tons lower than the previous
forecast, Liza Malyshko, a grain analyst at the Kiev-based
researcher, said in e-mailed comments today. Corn stockpiles
will be about 800,000 to 900,000 tons at the current marketing
year’s end on June 30, Malyshko said.  Grain exports this month and next will probably total about
2 million tons, according to the analyst. Outbound shipments
fell to 510,000 tons in May’s first two weeks from 1.14 million
tons a month earlier, Malyshko said.  Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk on March 13
predicted grain exports of about 2 million tons a month from
April through June.  End-of-season carryover stocks of grain will come to 12
million tons, Sergey Stoianov, director of the Ukrainian
Agrarian Confederation, said in a statement on the group’s
website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
