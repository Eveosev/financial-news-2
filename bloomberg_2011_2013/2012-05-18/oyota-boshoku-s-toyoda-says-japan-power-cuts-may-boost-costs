Shuhei Toyoda, president of  Toyota
Boshoku Corp. (3116) , Toyota Motor Corp.’s main supplier of car seats,
comments on possible power shortages this summer, after all of
 Japan ’s 54 nuclear reactors were shut down.  The Japanese government today asked companies in the Chubu
area, where Toyota Boshoku is based, to cut electricity usage by
5 percent compared with 2010 on business days from July 2 to
Sept. 28, according to a  press release .  On effects on Boshoku’s domestic production:  “We have paid to install power generators at our domestic
factories to create electric power on our own. The equipment is
powered by oil and the price of oil is currently rising. That
means higher production costs for us. I want the government to
think about the situation carefully.”  On outlook for car demand in Europe, China  “Car demand in  Europe  isn’t good. We decided to build a Czech
plant next year with a hope that the sales would recover to the
level the region had enjoyed in the past. For  China , views are
divided. Some inland provinces still see economic growth of
almost 15%. Some think China has potential for further growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
