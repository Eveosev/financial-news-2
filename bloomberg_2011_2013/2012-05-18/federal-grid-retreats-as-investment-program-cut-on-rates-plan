Federal Grid Co. retreated for a
second day on bets a reduced investment program at  Russia ’s
high-voltage power transmission monopoly signals the government
will raise prices the state company charges less than forecast.  Federal Grid fell 0.1 percent to 22.75 kopeks by the close
in Moscow after losing as much as 5 percent earlier. The shares
have dropped 19 percent this year.  Russia’s Energy Ministry approved 504.8 billion rubles
($16.1 billion) of investments for 2012-2014, according to a
statement from Federal Grid yesterday. That’s a 22 percent cut
from the previous version, ING Groep NV analysts wrote in an e-
mailed note today. The program was reduced because Federal
Grid’s tariffs will climb 11 percent in July, 10 percent next
year and 10 percent in 2014, RBC Daily reported today, citing a
government official it didn’t identify.  “Official approval of the reduced capex program is a
strong signal that the tariff hikes are likely to be approved
according to a pessimistic scenario,” Igor Goncharov, an
analyst at ING, said in an e-mailed note.  The stock rebounded after Russia’s Federal Tariff Service
recommended the Energy Ministry approve the investment program
of Federal Grid up to 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
