Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) ,  Vodafone (VOD)  Group
Plc and  SABMiller (SAB)  Plc are among 13 companies in the Stoxx Europe
600 Index that may boost dividends next week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Burberry, the U.K.’s largest luxury-goods maker, may raise
its final dividend by 19 percent to 17.8 pence, according to
Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts that factor in earnings and options
prices. Vodafone, the world’s largest mobile-phone company, may
increase its final dividend by 6.9 percent to 6.47 pence.
SABMiller, the second-biggest brewer by volume, may boost its
final payout to shareholders by 9.8 percent to 67.5 cents, the
data show.  Companies in the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  may increase shareholder payouts
by 14 percent in the next 12 months, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Per-share earnings are forecast to grow
46 percent in that period.  Homeserve Plc (HSV) , a U.K.-based emergency-repair company, might
raise its payout by 8.1 percent to 7.57 pence, while  United
Utilities Group Plc (UU/) , a U.K. water company, may do so by 6.7
percent to 21.34 pence.  Victrex Plc (VCT) ,  Firstgroup Plc (FGP)  and  Intermediate Capital Group
Plc (ICP)  are also among the companies that may increase their
dividends next week.  The Stoxx 600 has slumped 5.2 percent this week, heading
for its biggest weekly selloff since September, as  Greece  moved
closer to a possible exit from the euro currency union and
 China ’s growth showed signs of slowing. The benchmark measure
dropped 1 percent to 239.24 at 10:33 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
