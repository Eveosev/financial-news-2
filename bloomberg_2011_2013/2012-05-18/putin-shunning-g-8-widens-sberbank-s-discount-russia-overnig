OAO Sberbank (SBRCY)  led declines in New
York-traded  Russian companies  as protests against President
 Vladimir Putin  deepened the country’s second bear market in less
than a year.  American depositary receipts of Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, sank 8.3 percent yesterday to trade at the largest
discount to its Moscow shares in six months. The  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most traded Russian stocks in New
York fell 4 percent to 84.97, the lowest level since Oct. 7
while  futures  expiring in June on Russia’s RTS Index slid 2.1
percent to 128,085.  Activists are protesting in Moscow against alleged fraud in
parliamentary elections, fueling political stability concerns in
the world’s biggest energy exporter and deepening an equity
slump that’s been sparked by evidence of a global economic
slowdown. Putin won’t attend this week’s Group of Eight meeting
in the U.S. Russia’s benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  dropped 3.5 percent
yesterday, extending its decline from this year’s peak to 21
percent, as oil sank to a six-month low.  “The political factor plays a very significant role as
Putin’s refusal to attend the G-8 summit has a negative impact
on investors’ mood,” Veronika Chekina, an analyst at Infina
Investment Company, said by phone from Moscow yesterday.
“Investors are fleeing the market and Russia’s biggest
companies are getting hurt the most.”  First Bear Market  Russia was the first of the so-called BRIC countries to
enter a bear market in 2012 after the dollar-denominated RTS
extended a 20 percent decline on May 14 from a March 15 peak.
 Brazil ’s Bovespa Index followed the Russian gauge yesterday,
completing a 21 percent drop from its peak. The BSE  India 
Sensitive Index is down 13 percent from its high. The Shanghai
Composite Index has been in a  bear market  for more than a year.  Russia-focused equity funds recorded $251 million of
outflows in the seven days to May 9, the most this year, while
 China  lost $127 million, India $148 million and Brazil $167
million, EPFR Global data show.  Putin, who was re-elected for his third term in the office
in March, will skip the G-8 summit hosted by President  Barack Obama  this week. He’s set to become the first Russian leader to
completely miss the meeting since the country was included in
the group in 1998. Since Putin’s May 7 inauguration, activists
have protested non-stop in the streets of Moscow.  “Investors see more potential political risks ahead in
Russia should global growth sentiment collapse, and that also
aggravates the valuations of Russian assets,” Sergey Dergachev,
who helps oversee $8.5 billion in emerging-market funds at Union
Investment Privatfonds in  Frankfurt , said by e-mail yesterday.  Second Time  Yesterday’s retreat was the second time  the Micex entered
a bear market in the past 12 months. The Micex fell more than 20
percent in August 2011 from that year’s high.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell 4.8 percent to $24.38 yesterday, the
lowest since Sept. 4, 2009. The RTS Volatility Index, which
measures expected swings in the index futures, rose 7.7 percent
to 43.98 points in New York, the highest since Jan. 11.  Sberbank’s ADRs fell to $10.23, the lowest level in 2012,
pushing the discount versus Moscow to 1.4 percent, the most
since Dec. 13. The shares dropped 7.2 percent to 80.63 rubles,
or $2.59. One ADR equals four ordinary shares.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest coking coal producer, sank 7.9
percent to $5.91 yesterday, the lowest since April 2009. The
retreat widened the discount to the Moscow-listed shares to 5.5
percent, the most since Jan. 26. The  stock  fell 4.4 percent to
194.40 rubles, or $6.25 in Moscow yesterday. One depositary
receipts equals one ordinary share.  Crude Slumps  Oil, Russia’s major export commodity, fell to a six-month
low and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of commodities
dropped to the lowest since Dec. 19 as Moody’s downgraded 16
Spanish banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
general economic  index  shrank, bolstering concern that economic
growth and fuel demand will weaken.  Crude oil for June delivery dropped 0.3 percent to $92.56
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the lowest since
Nov. 2, 2011. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, fell 1.6
percent to $106.80. The S&P’s GSCI Index retreated 0.4 percent
to 630.07 yesterday.  Brent oil for July settlement slipped 2.1 percent to
$107.49 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 30. Brent’s premium to
the July West Texas Intermediate contract in New York narrowed
to $14.55 a barrel.  Camp David  Putin won’t attend the G-8 meeting in Camp David on May 18
through May 19 because he needs to continue forming the
country’s new government, the Kremlin said in a May 16  statement 
on its website. Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev , who stepped down
as president to allow Putin’s Kremlin return, will travel to the
U.S. for the summit.  The final composition of the government is expected to be
released next week, after Medvedev returns to Moscow,  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Troika Dialog, the investment bank
owned by state-run Sberbank, said in a May 17 e-mailed note.  “It seems the net result will be a mix of rotation of
people between the Kremlin and White House and job-hopping
within the existing cabinet,” Weafer wrote in the note. “Those
hoping for a more extensive change with a big influx of new
faces look set to be disappointed.”  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
sank 5.2 percent to HK$4.40 in Hong Kong trading as of the
city’s noon break. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
