Offshore  investors  bought a net  415
million rupees  ($7.6 million) of Indian stocks yesterday, taking
total investment in equities this year to 432.6 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 23 billion rupees of shares and sold 22.6
billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India  said on
its  website  today.  They sold a net 1.52 billion rupees of bonds, paring their
inflow into debt this year to 170.9 billion rupees, according to
the  data . They put 421 billion rupees in bonds in 2011.  Overseas funds have invested 4.876 trillion rupees into
equities and 1.378 trillion rupees in bonds since they were
allowed into the country in 1993.  India’s $1.1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Flows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  the
best performer among the world’s top 10 markets.  The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual
slump of 52 percent.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
