U.S. stocks dropped for a sixth day,
the longest slump since November for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, as  Facebook (FB)  Inc.’s record initial public offering failed
to boost confidence in a market rattled by  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Facebook rose 0.6 percent, paring a rally of 18 percent.
Underwriters bought the stock to keep it from falling below the
IPO price, people with knowledge of the matter said. The pricing
of the first transaction took a half hour longer than Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc.’s forecast.  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  tumbled 13 percent to a record
low after a volatility circuit breaker prompted two trading
halts that lasted at least 10 times longer than usual.  The S&P 500 retreated 0.7 percent to 1,295.22 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time and has declined 4.6 percent in  six days . The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  decreased 73.11 points, or 0.6 percent,
to 12,369.38 today. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1.2
percent to 2,778.79. About 8.9 billion shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, the most since Dec. 16.  “There was way too much hype with Facebook,” said  Philip Orlando , the New York-based chief equity strategist at Federated
Investors Inc. His firm oversees about $370 billion. “If it had
enjoyed a better move, there would have been some coattails for
the broader market. There’s pessimism related to  Greece , there’s
a G-8 meeting and nobody knows what’s going to come out of it.”  Stocks fell a third week in the longest losing streak since
August. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said turmoil
in the financial markets caused by Europe’s crisis may last
another two years, as Group of Eight leaders prepared to discuss
Greece and its impact on the global economy.  $1 Trillion  More than $1 trillion was erased from U.S. market value
this month amid concern about Europe’s debt crisis as Brazil and
 Russia  entered into bear markets. The Nasdaq Composite Index
extended its drop from this year’s peak in March to 11 percent.
A correction is considered a decline of at least 10 percent. The
 S&P 500  has fallen 8.7 percent from an almost four-year high in
April and trimmed its 2012 gain to 3 percent.  “Investors are still quite concerned about Europe,”  John Carey , who helps oversee about $220 billion at Pioneer
Investments in  Boston , said in a telephone interview. “I hope
we won’t have a severe correction, but anything is possible when
you have that kind of uncertainty.”  Equities rallied earlier today amid optimism about
Facebook’s trading debut. The delayed opening and halts in other
companies including Zynga weighed on the market following the
year’s most anticipated IPO.  Delayed Confirmations  Nasdaq OMX said in its website at 11:59 a.m. New York time
that it was having a problem delivering trade confirmations
related to the IPO. The exchange operator later said it had
distributed those messages.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will review the
trading, according to  John Nester , a spokesman.  “As is our practice, staff will review the incident with
Nasdaq to determine its cause and steps that will be taken to
address it,” he said in an e-mail.  Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ)  shares slumped 4.4 percent, the most since
October, to $21.99.  Facebook advanced 0.6 percent to $38.23. Its IPO price of
$38 valued the company at $104.2 billion, or  107 times  trailing
12-month earnings, more than every S&P 500 member except
Amazon.com Inc. and Equity Residential.  Zynga tumbled 13 percent to $7.16. The shares paused for a
volatility circuit breaker that normally lasts five minutes, and
failed to resume until about 50 minutes later. Another halt
lasted more than an hour.  Circuit Breaker  The stock was paused at 11:37 a.m. New York time after
dropping as much as 14 percent from yesterday’s close to $7.08.
The circuit breaker is triggered when a company rises or falls
10 percent within five minutes. It resumed at 12:27 p.m. and was
halted again two minutes later because of volatility. Trades
commenced at 1:35 p.m.  A measure of  technology  shares in the S&P 500 fell 1.2
percent for the biggest decline among 10 industries.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,
the most valuable company, gained 0.1 percent to $530.38,
snapping a five-day tumble. Google Inc. slumped 3.6 percent to
$600.40.  Autodesk Inc. (ADSK)  tumbled 13 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $30.26. The maker of architectural and engineering software
provided a second-quarter earnings forecast that trailed some
analysts’ estimates.  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  rallied 3.7 percent to $15.42. The company is
in talks to sell about 20 percent of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
back to the Chinese  Internet company  for about $7 billion,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Salesforce  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  rose 8.8 percent to $145.58. The
largest seller of online customer-management software forecast
fiscal second-quarter sales that  beat  estimates as it signs more
large deals with corporate customers.  The  slump  in U.S. stocks has pushed a gauge of market
momentum to levels last seen in August, a sign to some traders
that the S&P 500 fell too far, too fast.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities dropped 8.1 percent
through yesterday from a four-year high on April 2, sending the
14-day  relative strength  index for the S&P 500 to 25.1, the
lowest level in nine months. The indicator fell to 23.22 today.  The  RSI (SPX) , which measures the degree to which gains and
losses outpace each other, has been below 30 for three
consecutive days. Readings that low are considered signs to buy
by some analysts who use charts to make forecasts.  “RSI is like a rubber band,” Josh Dollinger, chief
quantitative and technical strategist at BTIG LLC in New York,
wrote in an e-mail. “The further back it’s pulled, the faster
and harder the snap back is. It’s difficult to time perfectly
but over the long term, buyers are often rewarded when stepping
in during these rare, extreme circumstances.”  The momentum indicator sank to 16.5 on Aug. 8 after S&P cut
the U.S. government’s credit rating from AAA. The S&P 500 then
slumped 1.8 percent through Oct. 3 before surging 29 percent by
April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
