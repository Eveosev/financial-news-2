Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB) , the owner of
the All Bar One chain, has two “very strong” candidates for
the role of chief executive officer, Bob Ivell, the company’s
executive chairman said in a conference call today.  “I have a shortlist of two,” Ivell said. “We’ve made
good progress,” Ivell said, adding that he had a “good
candidate to go with.” Ivell said he didn’t think the company
had suffered without a CEO in place since last year.  Simon Emeny, managing director of  Fuller Smith & Turner (FSTA)  and
Mike Tye, chief executive officer of Spirit Pub Company both
rejected informal approaches by Mitchells & Butlers for the job,
the Financial Times reported in February, citing people familiar
with the situation. The paper also reported that Steve Richards,
CEO of Novus, rejected an approach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
