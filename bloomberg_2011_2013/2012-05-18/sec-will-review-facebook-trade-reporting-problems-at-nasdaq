The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said it will review problems  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) 
said it had reporting trades in  Facebook Inc. (FB)  during its first
day as a publicly traded company.  “As is our practice, staff will review the incident with
Nasdaq to determine its cause and steps that will be taken to
address it,” John Nester, an SEC spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The pricing of the first transaction following yesterday’s
$16 billion stock sale took a half hour longer than Nasdaq’s
forecast. About 40 minutes later, the second-largest U.S.
equities exchange operator said it was investigating an issue in
reporting trades from the opening auction back to the brokerages
that made them. Nasdaq later said it delivered the messages.  The SEC routinely reviews reports of trading disruptions.  Rob Madden, a spokesman for  Nasdaq  OMX, didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
