A top surrogate to  Mitt Romney ,
Staples Inc. founder Tom Stemberg, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital,” airing this
weekend, that making money -- rather than creating jobs -- was
the primary goal of the presumed Republican Party presidential
nominee when he ran Bain Capital LLC and that Romney “acted
responsibly” as chief executive officer of the private-equity
firm. Stemberg appeared with a top backer of President  Barack
Obama , Lawrence Fish, the former chief executive officer of
Citizens Financial Group Inc., who questioned Romney’s record.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

founder and Romney surrogate Tom Stemberg and Larry Fish, an
Obama surrogate and former chairman and CEO of Citizens
Financial Group.  Want to welcome you to the show, gentlemen. Both of you are
joining us from  Massachusetts , not too far from each other, in
Boston and Newton. But I want to start with a story that’s
making headlines right now, and that’s word this week that a
Republican super-PAC had been considering launching an ad
campaign tying President Obama to his controversial former
pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, sort of bringing up some
questions about the millions of dollars from super PACs that
could be put toward character assassinations in this election.  And since you both have contributed to the Romney and Obama
super-PACs respectively, just wanted to ask you whether or not
you’re comfortable with having your money go toward these kinds
of efforts? And, Larry, let’s start with you.  LARRY FISH: Well, good morning, Julianna. I am not
comfortable with having my support of the president used in the
form of character assassination or negative campaigning. The
 Supreme Court  ruled on this. We are allowed to make these
contributions. I am completely public about my support of the
president’s PAC, and I think that that should be reciprocated by
the Republican supporters of the various Romney PACs.  So far, a lot of that money has been in the shadow. And it
would be helpful to the American people to be able to know the
amounts of that money and who is giving it.  But regardless, since it’s not required by law, to the
extent that the PACs support negative campaigning, I think it
will reflect badly on the candidates and - and probably not
going to work in the long run.  TOM STEMBERG: Well, Larry - Larry, the truth is - the truth
is, the Obama PAC just put out a totally misleading ad about
Mitt Romney’s involvement in private equity that’s totally
unrepresentative, that fact-checkers found is totally
fallacious, that - as  Peter Lynch  told me yesterday, this is so
ridiculous, because at the point in time that steel company -
which Mitt was no longer even involved with - filed bankruptcy,
25 other steel companies filed bankruptcy the same time during
foreign competition. And yet your money’s being used for that,
Larry.  GOLDMAN: Well -  STEMBERG: You guys are just unbelievable.  GOLDMAN: Well, Tom, let’s turn to private equity in a
moment, but I just want to pick up on something Larry said a
moment ago, which - whether or not this money from the super-PAC
should go to negative campaigning - are you prepared to say that
you don’t want your money going to the Romney super-PAC toward
negative campaigns?  STEMBERG: I believe that it’s essential that we get
somebody in the White House who knows what he is doing. Larry
got to run a big bank, but he only got to do so if he worked his
way up the ladder and had all kinds of different jobs to learn
how to be a banker.  We’ve got a guy in the White House now who was a community
organizer. I guess as a community organizer you give a lot of
speeches, because he certainly gives lots of speeches, but he
doesn’t know how to run anything. And his record demonstrates
that. So if it means that my money has to be used for negative
ads to demonstrate some of the foibles there, I can live with
that.  GOLDMAN: Larry?  FISH: Well, Tom and I disagree on that, and I’m hopeful
that the campaign will be a positive campaign and a true
discussion about the circumstance of the country. And I’m
perfectly prepared to defend the president’s record. I think it
has been, given the circumstances that he inherited, quite
outstanding. But we can get into the specifics on that,
Julianna.  GOLDMAN: All right. Well, let’s turn attention to this
debate over private equity, because the Obama campaign and the
Obama super-PAC did launch ads this week attacking Mitt Romney’s
time at  Bain Capital , saying that it created - that he was
focused on creating wealth for him and his investors, not jobs.
But, Tom, isn’t that the role of private equity?  STEMBERG: Well, I think the role of private equity as
fiduciaries is certainly to make money. I think the great news
about Mitt Romney’s involvement, he hasn’t just made money. He’s
helped grow some companies, which not unlike Staples have made
major contributions to society in the form of saving people
money. Or backing a woman named Linda Mason, who started Bright
Horizons and helped her grow a business which today employs
20,000 people around the  United States  and helps mothers go to
work. And we had one at Staples Center, and it really was
essential for the working mothers and our workforce. So these
things had redeeming social value, in addition to making Mitt
and his investors a lot of money.  GOLDMAN: So, Larry, though, private equity, it can play a
positive role in the economy. Isn’t that right?  FISH: Of course it can. And nothing that Mitt Romney or his
private-equity financial partners did as far as anybody knows
was the least bit illegal.  The question about private equity - and this applies to
Mitt Romney and his partners - specifically is whether when the
opposite of what Tom mentioned, when jobs are eliminated,
whether they have behaved fairly and whether they’ve behaved
responsibly. Was fair and complete severance provided to
displaced workers? Were their pensions honored? Were they given
a year’s worth of health benefits to facilitate the transition?
And were they supportive in a responsible way of the communities
that were hollowed out by the job loss? Was -  STEMBERG: Larry - Larry -  FISH:  -  money made available for job readiness programs?  STEMBERG: Larry, you know -  FISH: And whether or not -  STEMBERG: Larry, Larry, Larry -  FISH:  -  those programs were implemented.  GOLDMAN: Tom?  STEMBERG: Larry, you and I - you and I both know that when
a company goes bankrupt, you as a company have absolutely no say
whatsoever as to what happens. The judge and the trustee do. So,
I mean, whatever happened there - and I’m sure there were some
unfortunate circumstances there, cannot be laid to rest at Mitt
Romney’s lap. It just can’t be.  GOLDMAN: Well, Larry -  FISH: Well, we shouldn’t just be talking -  GOLDMAN: Go ahead.  FISH: Go ahead, Julianna.  GOLDMAN: No, no, you go ahead. Go ahead.  FISH: We shouldn’t - we shouldn’t just be talking about
bankruptcy. We should be talking about how private equity - and
Mitt Romney specifically - has behaved when jobs have been
eliminated. And that has happened often.  When  Governor Romney  - and I’m a resident here in
Massachusetts - was the governor of our state, we ranked 47th in
 job creation . Not last, but 47th in job creation.  STEMBERG: Larry -  FISH: The president, in the last three-and-a-half years, in
a very difficult global economy, in a very difficult global
economy, has created 4.2 million new jobs, in 26 months.  STEMBERG: Larry, Larry, Larry -  FISH: So I do know the record of the governor.  STEMBERG:  -  the president took over - the president took
over -  GOLDMAN: Tom, go ahead.  STEMBERG: Larry, again, the - the record is the record.
When the president took over, unemployment was under 8 percent.
He spent $800 billion of the taxpayers’ money on the so-called
stimulus, building bridges to nowhere. And not surprisingly,
after wasting all that money, we have - now have unemployment
over 8 percent.  GOLDMAN: OK.  STEMBERG: And most of those lost jobs have been women. And
we now have 23 million Americans looking for work. Our economy
is barely growing, despite zero percent interest rates. And, of
course, the president’s got great plans. When you’ve been in
office for three-and-a-half years, you ought to be running on
your record, not on trying to run away from it, and that
unfortunately is what the president’s doing.  GOLDMAN: Well, I want to ask just a more macro question
about this whole private-equity debate. Larry, are you concerned
that, you know, as we debate the merits of private equity, that
it could end up vilifying the financial industry as a whole?  FISH: No, I think it should be - thank you for asking that
question - there should be complete transparency. And the fact
is, there isn’t. And the question of fairness and responsibility
is an appropriate question to be raised. Whether private equity
has been loading companies up with debt, whether they’re been
declaring huge dividends, whether those companies have been
responsible in how they’ve managed the necessary downsizing that
has taken place in many of these situations, that’s a completely
fair and appropriate question that Mitt Romney should answer.  GOLDMAN: And, Tom, just 15 seconds left. I’ll give you the
last word.  STEMBERG: Well, again, I think Mitt Romney is an incredibly
responsible person. I had the privilege of working with him for
15 years at my side at Staples, maybe the best corporate
director I’ve ever seen. And not only that, he acted
responsibly.  GOLDMAN: Well, Tom, Larry, thank you both very much for the
time. It’s a debate I am sure we’ll be having quite a bit
between now and November.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
