Hidroelectrica SA,  Romania ’s state-
owned hydro-power generator, will eliminate some fixed  prices
for the energy it sells through bilateral contracts to some
companies such as  Alro SA. (ALR)   Hidroelectrica is re-negotiating the power-supply contracts
as requested by the  International Monetary Fund  and will
introduce “competitive” prices, Economy Minister Daniel
Chitoiu said during a conference in Bucharest today.  The IMF and the European Union have asked Romania to
renegotiate Hidroelectrica’s contracts after the EU competition
regulator started an investigation into possible state aid on
selling power at below-market prices. The Balkan nation secured
a 5 billion-euro ($6.35 billion) precautionary loan from IMF and
the EU to shelter itself from the European debt-crisis.  “We plan to complete the negotiation with the companies
that buy electricity from Hidroelectrica by the end of May,”
Chitoiu said. “We are negotiating the prices and bring them to
the current market levels, the quantities of power
delivered and the time period of these contracts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
