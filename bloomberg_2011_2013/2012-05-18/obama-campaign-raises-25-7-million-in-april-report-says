Reporting ahead of tomorrow’s
deadline, President  Barack Obama ’s campaign told the Federal
Election Commission that it had raised $25.7 million in April
and entered this month with $115.2 million in the bank.  Obama continued to rely on donations of $200 or less,
bringing in $10.7 million in small contributions. He also
transferred $4.5 million from a joint fundraising account with
the  Democratic National Committee , according to the FEC reports
filed yesterday.  The president has now raised $222.3 million for his re-
election. Four years ago at this time, engaged in a battle for
the Democratic nomination with  Hillary Clinton , now the U.S.
secretary of state, Obama had taken in $272.2 million and had
$46.5 million cash-on-hand.  The April haul is less than the $35.1 million Obama raised
last month. It doesn’t include the $15 million the campaign and
Democratic party raised May 10 at a dinner hosted by actor
 George Clooney  in Los Angeles.  Among the donors to Obama’s campaign last month were actor
Robert De Niro; Nigel Travis, chief executive officer of Canton,
Massachusetts-based  Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. (DNKN) ; and Laura D’Andrea Tyson, a professor at the University of California at
Berkley, a member of Obama’s Council on Jobs and
Competitiveness, and a former economic adviser to President Bill Clinton.  Online Ads  The campaign spent $14.6 million last month, including $2.4
million on online ads and $2.3 million on media.  The Democratic National Committee reported raising $14.4
million last month and had $24.3 million in the bank.  Presumptive Republican nominee  Mitt Romney  and the
 Republican National Committee  said they had brought in $40.1
million. Some of the money raised also went to state parties.
Romney’s campaign report is due at the FEC tomorrow.  Earlier this month, Romney, a former Massachusetts
governor, and his wife, Ann, each gave $75,000 to the Republican
joint fundraising committee, according to a Romney aide speaking
on condition of anonymity.  Romney, who spent $44.7 million of his own money on his
2008 campaign, hadn’t previously donated to his 2012 run.  To contact the reporters on this story:
