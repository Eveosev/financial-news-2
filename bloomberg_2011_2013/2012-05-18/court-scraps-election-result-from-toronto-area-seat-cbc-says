A Canadian judge has thrown out the
results in a Toronto-area district from last year’s federal
election, CBC News reported.  The judge’s decision came after the Liberal Party candidate
appealed his 26-vote loss to a Conservative candidate, claiming
voting irregularities, CBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
