(Corrects spelling of development in headline.)  Alterra Power Corp. (AXY) , which operates
renewable power plants, acquired four early-stage wind projects
in  Canada  with more than 1 gigawatt of total capacity.  Alterra isn’t providing an upfront payment to the wind-farm
developer  English Bay Energy Ltd.  for the  projects  on Vancouver
Island and three smaller islands in British Columbia, according
to a statement today.  English Bay will receive royalty payments when the wind
farms go into operation and may also receive as many as 1.34
million shares of Vancouver-based Alterra.  The company requires additional permits and wind data to
determine where to install turbines, and construction is
“several years” away, Anders Kruus, an Alterra spokesman, said
by telephone.  Alterra also needs power-purchase agreements with British
Columbia Hydro & Power Authority, Kruus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
