Mark Zuckerberg  remains one of the 30
richest people on Earth after shares of  Facebook Inc. (FB) , the
world’s most popular social networking company, hovered near the
initial public offering price in its trading debut.  The company’s shares rose 0.6 percent to $38.23 as of 4
p.m. in New York after earlier trading at the IPO price of $38,
which valued the company at $104.2 billion. Zuckerberg’s net
worth rose $100 million to $19.4 billion, ranking him 26th on
the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index , ahead of  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s  Sergey
Brin  and  Larry Page .  “All the big investors and hedge funds came in for a quick
flip,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital
Management LLC, in a telephone interview from his New York
office. “There was definitely a lot of pressure at the open.”  Facebook raised $16 billion in an initial public offering,
selling 421.2 million shares for $38 each on May 17. It was the
biggest technology IPO in history. The company began the day
valued at 107 times trailing 12-month earnings.  Facebook’s chief executive officer sold 30.2 million shares
of the  Menlo Park , California-based company for $1.15 billion at
the offering. Most of the proceeds will be used to pay taxes
associated with exercising 60 million  stock options . He now owns
503.6 million shares.  “Hundreds of Millions”  Dustin Moskovitz, 27, who co-founded Facebook with
Zuckerberg from their dorm room at  Harvard University , owns
133.7 million shares of the company’s Class B stock worth $5.1
billion. He will sell 7.5 million shares if the underwriters
exercise their option to buy additional stock.  Moskovitz, the company’s first chief technology officer,
left the social network with Facebook colleague Justin Rosenstein in 2008. The duo founded Asana Inc., a task
management software company. The company received $9 million in
funding from venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and
 Benchmark Capital  in 2009, both of Menlo Park.  Eduardo Saverin, 30, has a $2 billion stake. According to a
regulatory filing dated May 17, he owns 53.1 million shares of
the company.  The Brazil-born Facebook co-founder renounced his U.S.
citizenship last year and is now a permanent resident of
Singapore.  “I am obligated to and will pay hundreds of millions of
dollars in taxes to the United States government,” he said in a
May 17 statement.  The New Republic  Co-founder Christopher Hughes, 28, fell short of becoming a
billionaire. He owns about 22 million shares of Facebook,
according to a person familiar with his holdings who asked not
to be named because the matter is private. His stake is worth
$840 million.  Hughes, who bought the Washington, D.C.-based magazine the
New Republic in March 2012 for less than $5 million, has more
than $100 million in cash and real estate after selling some of
his Facebook hoard, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Peter Thiel  provided Facebook’s first outside investment:
$500,000 in 2004. The Founders Fund Management LLC partner sold
16.8 million shares during the offering and owns almost 28
million shares of Facebook following the deal, according to
regulatory filings. His shares are valued at $1.1 billion.  Thiel, Parker  Thiel was brought to Facebook by technology entrepreneur
 Sean Parker , who persuaded Zuckerberg to move to California to
focus on the company full time in 2004. The 32-year-old Parker
owns 66 million Facebook shares worth $2.5 billion. He will sell
10 million shares if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares.  Facebook’s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg , 42, who
was lured from Google in 2008, owns 27 million shares, including
25 million restricted stock units that have vested. They are
valued at $1 billion.  Sandberg owns more than 14 million unvested units that
aren’t counted in her net worth calculation. She also owns small
stakes in Starbucks Corp. and Walt Disney Co.; she is a director
at both companies.  Facebook’s offering further elevated  Mark Pincus , the
founder of  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , the world’s largest social gaming
company, in the billionaire ranks. Pincus, 46, owns 13 percent
of Zynga, whose popular online games such as Mafia Wars and
Farmville generated more than 10 percent of Facebook’s sales in
2011. Zynga shares are down more than 50 percent since March.  Pincus owns 4.3 million shares of Facebook valued at $165
million. He sold 1 million Facebook shares during the offering,
earning him $38 million.  Russian Billionaires  Alisher Usmanov , Russia’s richest man, has an estimated 80
percent interest in the 85.6 million Facebook shares held by
certain DST Global funds. The DST Global entities are controlled
by billionaire Yuri Milner, and sold 45.7 million shares in the
offering. The funds may sell more in the coming months,
according to regulatory filings.  Milner owns about 12.5 percent of DST Global’s Facebook
shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. His stake is
worth $409 million. The DST Global funds own stakes in Zynga,
Groupon Inc. and Twitter Inc.  Usmanov -- whose most valuable asset is his 45 percent
stake in Metalloinvest, Russia’s largest iron ore producer -- has
never met Zuckerberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
