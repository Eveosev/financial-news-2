Japan ’s domestic shipments of solar
cells and modules surged 38 percent to 392 megawatts in the
first three months of this year, the Japan Photovoltaic Energy
Association  said  today.  The growth was led by the residential market, which rose 45
percent to 331 megawatts, the industry group said in a
statement. Exports fell 53 percent to 163 megawatts.  For the full year ended March 31, domestic shipments rose
32 percent to 1,404 megawatts as the residential market
increased 40 percent to 1,206 megawatts, the association said.
Exports for that period fell 13 percent to 1,281 megawatts.  Mikio Katayama, chairman of the association, said yesterday
domestic shipments will exceed 2,500 megawatts in the year
ending March 2013. His remarks came as the country prepares to
start preferential rate payments in July for electricity
generated from renewable sources, including solar and wind.  The data was compiled from 34 companies including  Kyocera
Corp. (6971)  and Sharp Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
