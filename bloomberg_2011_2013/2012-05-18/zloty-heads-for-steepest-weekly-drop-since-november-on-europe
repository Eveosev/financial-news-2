The Polish zloty retreated for a
second day, extending its steepest weekly loss in almost six
months as  Europe ’s debt crisis worsened.  The zloty lost 0.3 percent to 4.3653 per euro as of 10:04
a.m. in Warsaw. It lost 2.4 percent this week for the biggest
decline since the week ended Nov. 25, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The zloty hit a four-month low this week as Greece failed
to form a coalition, prompting the government to sell euros from
European Union funds on the  currency market . Moody’s Investors
Service lowered debt ratings on 16 Spanish banks, while  Fitch
Ratings  cut Greece’s credit rating on concern the country may
not be able to sustain euro membership.  “The situation on the market is solely the upshot of the
situation in  Greece  and the uncertainty around its future in the
euro area,” Janusz Dancewicz, chief economist at the Polish
unit of DZ Bank AG, wrote in a note to clients. “The market is
clearly driven by emotions.”  The Finance Ministry is “taking advantage of the
weakness” of the zloty to sell foreign currency on the market
and lower its “high volatility,” Deputy Finance Minister
Dominik Radziwill wrote in an e-mailed comment yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
