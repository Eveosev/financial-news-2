The Edmonton Oilers fired coach Tom Renney after back-to-back losing seasons.  The Oilers had the second-worst record in the  National
Hockey League  this season at 32-40-10 after posting the worst
mark the previous year, 25-45-12.  “We felt at this time it was the right decision to make a
change,” General Manager Steve Tambellini said in a video
statement on the team’s website. “We’ve got some great
challenges, but ones that we’re looking forward to.”  Renney, 57, who became the 10th head coach in Oilers’
history, joined the team as an associate coach for the 2009-10
season.  He spent the previous nine seasons with the  New York 
Rangers, four as the head coach who led the team to 40-or-more
wins in three consecutive seasons. His record with the Rangers
of 164-117-0-46 included three post-season appearances from
2005-08.  Renney also was head coach of the  Vancouver Canucks ,
earning a 39-53-9 record from June 1996 to November 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
