Nucor Corp. (NUE) , the biggest U.S.
recycler of steel products, agreed to buy Skyline Steel LLC from
 ArcelorMittal (MT)  for about $605 million to add specialty steel
distribution in North America and the Caribbean.  The acquisition gives Nucor control of a company that has
distributed its steel for more than two decades,  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based Nucor said in statement. Skyline had sales
of $873 million last year, ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest
steelmaker, said in a separate statement.  Buying Skyline gives Nucor 21 sales offices as well as
distribution and fabrication facilities. ArcelorMittal, which
said it will retain control of Skyline’s Latin American
operations, said the sale was in line with its strategy of
selling non-core assets and reducing debt.  “Skyline is well positioned to continue to grow in the
piling and foundation products area in  North America ,” Nucor
Chairman Daniel R. DiMicco, said in the statement. “They will
become a more valuable downstream consumer of Nucor’s coiled
plate and sheet products.”  Skyline will also retain exclusive rights to sell
ArcelorMittal’s piling and foundation products in North America
and the Caribbean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
