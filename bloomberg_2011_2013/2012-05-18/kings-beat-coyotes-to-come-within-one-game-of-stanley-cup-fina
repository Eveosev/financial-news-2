Dwight King scored the game-winning
goal as the  Los Angeles Kings  defeated the Phoenix Coyotes 2-1
to move within one win of advancing to the National Hockey
League’s Stanley Cup Final.  The Kings have a 3-0 advantage in the best-of-seven Western
Conference series. The winner will play the  New York Rangers  or
the  New Jersey Devils  in the championship round. The Eastern
Conference finals resume tomorrow at Prudential Center in Newark,
New Jersey, with the Rangers and Devils tied at 1-1.  Daymond Langkow scored his first playoff goal with a 29-
foot wristshot a minute into the second period to give the
Coyotes a 1-0 lead at Staples Center in Los Angeles. Anze Kopitar tied the score two minutes later with a 10-foot backhand.  King’s 29-foot wristshot one minute, 47 seconds into the
final period clinched the victory for the Kings, who host Game 4
on May 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
