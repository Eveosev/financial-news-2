Brazil , the world’s largest coffee
grower, will produce 53.9 million bags of the beans in the
coming 2012-13 crop year, according to Terra Forte Exportacao e
Importacao de Cafe Ltda.  That is unchanged from a February forecast and higher than
the 50.4 million bags estimated by Conab, the Ministry of
Agriculture’s crop-forecasting agency. Growers will harvest 37.4
million bags of arabica beans and 16.5 million bags of the
robusta variety, Terra Forte, Brazil’s second-biggest exporter,
said in its third estimate for the season starting in July.  “Our last report suggested harvesting could be delayed in
some key areas, due to late flowering, which has been
confirmed,” the Sao Joao da Boa Vista, Brazil-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today. “The rains in May have
contributed to this delay and appear to have affected quality,
particularly in the Zona da Mata region.”  Rains this month were beneficial and prospects for the
2013-14 crop are “good at the moment,” the exporter said.
Brazil is set to produce less coffee in the period as arabica
trees enter the lower-yielding half of a two-year cycle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
