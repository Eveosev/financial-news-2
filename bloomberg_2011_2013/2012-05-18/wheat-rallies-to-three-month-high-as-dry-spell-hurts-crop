Wheat surged to the highest price
since early February, heading for the biggest weekly increase in
21 months, on speculation that dry weather in the U.S. and the
 Black Sea region  will hurt crops and limit production.  Little or no rain has fallen during the past 30 days in
parts of  Kansas , the biggest U.S. producer, National Weather
Service data show. Russia’s grain crop will total 91 million
metric tons this year, 2.7 percent less than forecast in April,
because of dry weather, the country’s Institute for Agricultural
Markets, known as Ikar, said today.  “In Russia and Ukraine, there’s a smaller crop,” Jamey Kohake, a broker at Paragon Investments in  Silver Lake , Kansas,
said by telephone. In Kansas, “the crop is not near as good as
it was two weeks ago,” with yield losses of 20 percent to 30
percent, he said. “There’s been no rain, and just heat and
wind.”  Wheat futures for July delivery gained 3.2 percent to
$6.785 a bushel at 10:05 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after reaching $6.80, the highest since Feb. 1. The price has
gained 14 percent this week, heading for the biggest weekly gain
since August 2010.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
