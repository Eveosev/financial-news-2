Crude-oil options volatility rose as
the underlying futures fell to a six-month low on concern that
 Greece  will abandon the euro, deepening a credit crisis in
 Europe  and reducing fuel demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 29.6 percent at 3:50 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up from 29.2 yesterday.  “It was up since we starting coming off after we broke the
low of $92,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in  New York . “There’s still nothing positive
coming out of Europe.”  Crude oil for June delivery fell $1.08 to $91.48 a barrel
on the Nymex, the lowest settlement since Oct. 26. July crude
dropped $1.14, or 1.2 percent, to $91.80.  European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  warned Greece that the EU would continue to demand
budget discipline after a June 17 election that may increase the
risk of the nation’s exit from the euro.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were July $110 calls, which were unchanged at 14 cents a barrel
at 4:03 p.m. with 3,728 lots trading. July $120 calls were the
second-most active options with 3,199 lots changing hands as
they fell 1 cent to 7 cents.  Calls in Majority  Calls accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
