Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL) ,
Turkey’s second-biggest group of companies, slumped the most
this year after missing analysts’ estimates for first-quarter
profit and revising its sales forecast downward.  Sabanci Holding dropped as much as 4.1 percent, the most
since Dec. 12, before paring its loss to 3.3 percent at 7.02
liras at the close in Istanbul.  Net income at the company, which owns stakes in lender
 Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  and energy producer Enerjisa Enerji Uretim AS,
slipped to 296.4 million liras ($162 million) from 401.5 million
liras a year earlier, Sabanci said in a statement to the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange  today. The company was expected to earn
344.9 million liras, according to the average of nine analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sabanci targets sales growth of more than 10 percent this
year, chief executive Zafer Kurtul said in an e-mailed statement
today. The company previously planned to increase sales 20
percent, Kurtul’s said at a news conference in Istanbul Feb. 24.  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) , Turkey’s biggest group of companies, also
reported a decline in first-quarter profit today to 538 million
liras from 545 million liras a year ago. Koc shares slid 1.3
percent to 6.02 liras.  To contact the reporter on this story:
