OAO Gazprom, Russiaâ€™s gas export
monopoly, will sign an agreement to cut  gas prices  for supplies
to  Bulgaria  by 11.1 percent, the Ministry of Energy, Economy and
Tourism in Sofia said.  The price reduction was agreed on during a meeting in
Moscow between Bulgarian and Gazprom officials earlier this week
and the documents will be signed this month, the ministry said
on its website.  Gazprom pumps 17.8 billion cubic meters of gas a year to
Bulgaria, about 3.5 billion cubic meters of which is consumed
there. The rest goes on to  Turkey ,  Greece  and Macedonia under a
30-year contract signed in 2006.  Bulgaria  imports all of its gas from Russia and is now
seeking to diversify supplies after they were cut for two weeks
in 2009 following a price dispute between Ukraine and  Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
