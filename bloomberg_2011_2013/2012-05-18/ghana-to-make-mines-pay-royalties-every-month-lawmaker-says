Ghana , Africa’s second-largest gold
producer, plans to pass a law requiring mines to pay royalties
monthly instead of quarterly, said Ernest Kofi Yakah, chairman
of the parliamentary select committee on mines and energy.  “This will facilitate prompt access to funds by government
and distribution for development projects in mining communities
across the country,” Yakah said in an interview yesterday in
the capital, Accra. The bill is before the committee and will
become law by the end of the year, he said.  Parliament has passed legislation to implement the tax
increases on mining companies announced by Finance Minister
Kwabena Duffuor in November during his budget statement for
2012. The measures raise the corporate  tax rate  to 35 percent
from 25 percent, impose a windfall tax of 10 percent and reduce
the amount of  capital spending  that companies can write down.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
