Moore Capital  Management LP, the
hedge fund founded by Louis Bacon, hired former  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
executive Patrick Lynch as a credit portfolio manager at the $15
billion firm, according to an investor.  Lynch, 42, started this week at Moore’s London office, said
the investor, who asked not to be named because the fund is
private.  Lynch left Morgan Stanley in January. He was most recently
head of European credit sales and trading, based in London. He
had previously headed the bank’s Asian corporate credit group in
Hong Kong and worked on the high-yield desk in  New York .  Hedge funds are benefiting as Wall Street’s biggest banks
have lost almost two dozen of their most-profitable credit
traders in the past 13 months amid tighter rules. Regulators
have sought to restrict proprietary trading, which limits risk-
taking by banks. In the U.S., the so-called Volcker rule, the
provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act named for former Federal
Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker , will set limits on risk-taking by
banks with federally insured deposits.  Banks are also cutting and deferring pay, sending traders
to seek better opportunities at hedge funds and investment firms
that seek to profit in markets lenders are retreating from.  Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Moore Capital, declined to
comment on the hire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
