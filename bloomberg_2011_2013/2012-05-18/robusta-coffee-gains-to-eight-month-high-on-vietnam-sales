Robusta coffee climbed to the highest
price in more than eight months as sales in  Vietnam  slowed,
sending local prices to the highest since October.  Sales of beans in Vietnam, the largest grower of robusta
beans, slowed as farmers’ stockpiles became “thinner,”
Volcafe, the coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings
Ltd., said in a report e-mailed today. Vietnamese beans reached
42,000 dong ($2.02) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) yesterday, the
highest price since Oct. 18,  data  from the Dak Lak Trade &
Tourism Center on Bloomberg show. The price eased to 41,800 dong
today.  Robusta coffee has climbed 23 percent so far this year as
demand increases, especially in  emerging markets . Global coffee
demand will rise by about 2 percent in 2011-12, according to
London-based broker Marex Spectron Group. All of the growth will
come from robusta beans, the broker said.  The “rising demand trend in robusta has significantly
tightened the global robusta market, quickly absorbing much of
the large Vietnam crop, and leading to falling European
stocks,”  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
London, said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Robusta coffee for July delivery was up 1.8 percent to
$2,226 a metric ton by 4:07 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. The
price touched $2,235 earlier today, the highest since Sept. 5. A
Bloomberg Survey published on March 26 predicted prices would
reach $2,236 a ton by the end of May.  Roasters may be tapping beans stockpiled in  Europe  as
Vietnam exports drop. Inventories with valid certificates in
warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe were 171,380 tons as of May
14, down 0.7 percent from 172,530 tons two weeks earlier, the
exchange said yesterday. Stockpiles have been falling since
reaching an all-time high of 417,420 tons on July 11.  Cheaper Option  “Right now robusta still provides a cheaper option for
roasters’ blends, as they try to capture emerging market
customers as well as cater to the lower-end segment at the
traditional markets,” Haque said. “The tighter fundamentals
for robusta will continue to support  London  futures.”  Robusta coffee for July delivery was $32 a ton higher than
beans for September delivery, up from $25 yesterday, data on
Bloomberg show. That market structure is known as backwardation
and may signal limited supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
