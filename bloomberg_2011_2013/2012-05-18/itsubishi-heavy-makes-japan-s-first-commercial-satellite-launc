Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)  and
 Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency  made their first commercial
satellite launch today in a challenge to European and Russian
services.  A Korea Aerospace Research Institute satellite was onboard
an H-2A rocket that blasted off at 1:39 a.m. from the
Tanegashima Space Center, which is on a Pacific Ocean island off
the southern coast of mainland  Japan , according to a  statement 
from JAXA on its website. The rocket also carried a Japanese
satellite.  Japan has begun to compete with Evry, France-based
Arianespace, the world’s largest commercial satellite launcher,
and Russia’s Proton to find new revenue for its space program.
The nation launches as many as three H-2A rockets a year under a
program run by Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Heavy since 2007.  “We’re very happy with the launch of a South Korean
satellite as Japan’s first commercial payload,” Motohisa Furukawa, Japan’s minister for space development, said in a
faxed statement. “We support securing more opportunities for
our satellite-launch service.”  Today’s takeoff was Japan’s 52nd rocket launch since the
program began in 1975. It was the 15th H-2A launch in a row not
to suffer a fault, giving the model a 95.2 percent success rate,
according to the statement. An H-2A rocket failed in 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
