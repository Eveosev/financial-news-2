A Westport,  Connecticut  owner of an
import-export business pleaded guilty to defrauding Citizens
Bank NA of almost $7 million by lying to the lender about the
companyâ€™s financial condition.  Daniel Lyons, 54, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud
before U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Martinez in Hartford today,
according to statement by David Fein, the U.S. Attorney for
Connecticut.  Lyons, the chief executive officer of Greenwich Trading
Co., applied in 2007 for a revolving line of credit from
Citizens Bank, and subsequently falsified audit reports and
other documents while drawing funds, prosecutors said. After
reaching the limit of the loan, the company filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy protection in 2009, according to the statement.  Its accounts receivable at the time of the filing were
$380,000, the U.S. said. The previous year he told Citizens Bank
he had between $7.3 million and $9.2 million in accounts
receivable.  Lyons will be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Robert Chatigny on Aug. 10. He faces a maximum 30-year prison term, the
 Justice Department  said.  The case is U.S. v. Lyons, 12-00115, U.S. District Court,
District of Connecticut ( New Haven ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
