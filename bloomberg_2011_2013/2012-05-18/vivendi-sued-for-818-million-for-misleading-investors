Vivendi SA (VIV)  and Jean-Marie Messier are
being sued for 644.5 million euros ($818 million) in Paris by
for misleading them between 2000 and 2002, a lawyer for the
claimants said.  The suit, filed by 67 investors at the commercial tribunal
in Paris on April 27, claims the company and the former CEO
improperly inflated the value of its shares, said  Ron Soffer , a
Paris-based attorney.  Vivendi won a U.S. court ruling in 2011 that limited the
scope of an earlier group securities-fraud verdict against the
company to holders of its American depositary receipts, applying
a U.S Supreme Court decision saying the court didn’t have
jurisdiction in the action.  “Now that the reach of the U.S. class action mechanism has
been seriously limited by the Supreme Court securities
litigation, courts in  France  and other European jurisdictions
will see more of this type of action being brought before
them,” Soffer, of law firm Cabinet Soffer, said in a phone
interview today.  A Manhattan jury in 2010 found that Vivendi misled
shareholders about its financial health 57 times from 2000 to
2002. Lawyers for the investors claimed at the time that damages
to the entire shareholders’ class totaled $9.3 billion.  A June hearing has been scheduled in Paris to set a
deadline for Vivendi to respond to the claims, Soffer said. The
Paris-based company didn’t immediately respond to requests for
comment.  Vivendi agreed in 2003 to pay $50 million to settle U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission accusations of civil fraud,
and Messier agreed to pay a $1 million fine.  Messier’s bid to overturn a previous a court decision to
fine him 150,000 euros for misleading investors during his
tenure as chief executive will be heard at a Paris appeals court
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
