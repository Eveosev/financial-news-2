President  Barack Obama  called the
European debt crisis an issue of “extraordinary importance” to
the global economy and said that fiscal responsibility should be
coupled with policies to promote growth.  Obama made the comments after meeting with French President
 Francois Hollande  at the White House, hours before they join
other leaders of the Group of Eight nations at a summit at Camp
David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.  Hollande, through a translator, said growth must be a
priority along with improved finances. He and Obama “share the
same views” that Greece should stay in the euro region “and
that all of us must do what we can to that effect.”  Obama said the G-8 leaders will talk tonight and tomorrow
“about how we can manage a responsible approach to fiscal
consolidation that is coupled with a strong growth agenda.”  The agenda for Obama’s meeting with Hollande, their first,
matched many of the issues that will be in front of the rest of
the G-8 tonight and tomorrow: the  European debt crisis  and the
situation in Greece, the winding down of the war in  Afghanistan 
and the international response to  Iran  and Syria. Also on the
G-8’s list of topics are the world oil market and the use of
strategic petroleum reserves to keep crude prices stable.  Hollande earlier this month became the first Socialist in
17 years to control Europe’s second-biggest economy by defeating
Nicolas Sarkozy, with whom Obama developed a close working
relationship in dealing with issues from  Libya  to Iran.  Views on Growth  Hollande’s advocacy of more growth and less austerity in
Europe puts him at odds with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ,
who opposes adding to nations’ debt burdens. That makes Hollande
a potentially valuable ally for Obama, who has advocated a more
growth-focused approach. Merkel will also attend the Camp David
meetings.  European leaders face pressure to do more to quell the
crisis after almost $4 trillion was wiped from global equity
markets this month amid speculation that  Greece  will exit the
euro.  European stocks  headed for their biggest weekly decline
since November and the euro touched a four-month low amid
investor concern that the crisis is worsening.  Yields on two-, five-, and 30-year German securities
earlier fell to all-time lows after Moody’s Investors Service
lowered the credit ratings of 16 Spanish banks, spurring demand
for Europe’s safest government debt. Separately, Greece’s credit
grade was lowered one level by  Fitch Ratings .  Compatible Goals  Europe’s G-8 chiefs -- Hollande, Merkel, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Monti and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, plus
European Union leaders Herman Van Rompuy and Jose Barroso --held
a video call on the crisis yesterday and agreed that fiscal
rigor and economic growth are mutually compatible, Merkel’s
office said. The G-8 also includes Russia and Canada.  “During the G-8, it’s very important to see that the
Europeans form a common position as quickly as possible,”
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said in a recorded
interview broadcast today on  France ’s  Europe  1 radio. “In
recent years we haven’t been quick enough” at doing that.  The U.S. is seeking agreement on a common goal “to
preserve the foundations of the euro zone, to address the
current crisis facing Europe, particularly as a result of the
political events in Greece,” White House National Security
Adviser Tom Donilon said.  Oil Reserves  At their news conference, Hollande said he and Obama didn’t
discuss using strategic oil reserves, though that will be one of
the topics when the G-8 leaders convene tonight. He said France
was ready to use all tools to keep  oil prices  low.  The subject is being discussed as the U.S. and its allies
prepare for the imposition of a European Union embargo on
Iranian oil that’s set to begin July 1. A steep rise in prices
may threaten the global economy.  The  International Energy Agency  has no definite plan to
release fuel from its emergency reserves,  David Fyfe , the head
of its oil industry and markets division, said at a conference
in  London  today.  U.S. officials have repeatedly said that no decision has
been made on using the reserves in the U.S. and Europe, which
were last tapped in June 2011 to offset a disruption in supplies
caused by upheaval in the  Middle East  and North Africa  Crude oil for June delivery fell $1.08 to $91.48 a barrel
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since
Oct. 26. Prices retreated 4.8 percent this week, and are down
7.4 percent this year.  Afghanistan Role  While Obama and Hollande affirmed their common concerns
about keeping up pressure on Iran over its nuclear program and
on the government of Syria, one area of potential friction is
the Afghan war.  Hollande made a campaign pledge to withdraw French combat
forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2012, a year ahead of
Sarkozy’s plan and against U.S. wishes. That may frustrate U.S.
efforts to keep European forces in place there through 2014, and
to get NATO partners to help underwrite an estimated $4.1
billion a year in assistance to Afghan security forces over the
following decade.  Hollande said he’s confident a deal can be reached under
which “allies can continue with their mission and at the same
time I can comply with the promise that I made to the French
people.”  Commitment to Alliance  Hollande reaffirmed France’s commitment to its alliance
with the U.S. “We’ve had our differences but we’ve always
managed to overcome them,” he said.  Donilon signaled yesterday that Obama accepts Hollande’s
plans for combat force withdrawals and will focus on what other
sort of contributions Hollande may offer, such as trainers or
other types of assistance.  From the G-8 meeting in rural  Maryland , most of the leaders
will travel tomorrow evening to  Chicago  for a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization summit where a central topic is a discussion
of military issues, including funding and manpower to support
Afghanistan after coalition forces leave at the end of 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
