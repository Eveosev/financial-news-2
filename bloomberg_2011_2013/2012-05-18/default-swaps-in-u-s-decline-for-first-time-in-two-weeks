A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
fell from the highest level of the year as the Group of Eight
leaders meet to discuss ways to contain  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, dropped 2.4 basis points to a mid-price of
120.8 basis points at 8:45 a.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the first decline for the index in
12 trading days.  G-8 leaders are expected to pressure European leaders
including German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to take additional
steps to stem the sovereign debt crisis as concern over  Greece ’s
withdrawal has pushed the swaps gauge wider this month.  The index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, has jumped by more than
25 basis points this month as Greece heads for another round of
elections. The gauge closed at 123.2 basis points yesterday, the
highest level this year.   The swaps contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt. The index last closed at a
higher level on Jan. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
