U.S. stocks tumbled for a third week,
pushing the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its longest losing
streak since August, amid concern global economic growth is
slowing and Greece may leave the euro area.  All  10 industries  in the  S&P 500  fell. Financial and raw-
material companies dropped at least 6.5 percent as shareholders
sued  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  over the company’s $2 billion trading
loss and the  Dollar Index ’s longest rally ever reduced the
prices of commodities. J.C. Penney Co. and  Abercrombie & Fitch
Co. (ANF)  each plunged 23 percent after reporting sales that missed
analysts’ estimates.  Facebook  Inc. climbed 0.6 percent in its
trading debut, erasing most of an 18 percent rally.  The S&P 500 tumbled 4.3 percent to 1,295.22, the biggest
retreat since November. The index sank 7.7 percent over three
weeks, trimming its 2012 gain to 3 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  slipped 451.22 points, or 3.5 percent, to
12,369.38, the lowest level since Jan. 6. The  Nasdaq Composite
Index (CCMP)  plunged 5.3 percent, the most since September, to
2,778.79, extending its loss from a  March high  to 11 percent.  “We sort of hit an air pocket in terms of positive
catalysts and meanwhile Europe keeps weighing on the market,”
John Kattar, chief investment officer at Eastern Investment
Advisors in Boston, which manages $1.7 billion, said in a phone
interview. “It was a very good earnings season, but that
catalyst is behind us.”  Bear Market  Global equities slumped, with the  MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC)  that
tracks stocks in Brazil, Russia, India and China entering a bear
market, with a drop of more than 20 percent from this year’s
peak.  Fitch Ratings  cut Greece’s credit rating on concern the
country won’t be able to stay in the euro area after
inconclusive elections left the country without a stable
government. U.S. reports sent mixed signals, with housing starts
and industrial production topping estimates while manufacturing
in the Philadelphia region unexpectedly shrank.  The S&P 500’s retreat in May is almost four times worse
than 2011. More than  $1.14 trillion  has been erased from
American equity values this month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with about $299 billion in the 14 days
after April 29, 2011, when the index reached its highest level
in three years.  Faltering stocks, reports showing weaker economic growth
and concern about the health of countries from Spain to Italy is
reminding investors of 2011, one of the most volatile years on
record as the S&P 500 dropped as much as 19 percent. Investors
bracing for a retreat pulled $18 billion from U.S. equity mutual
funds last month, the most since at least 1984, according to the
Investment Company Institute.  VIX Jumps  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the  VIX (VIX) , jumped 26 percent for the week, the most since
September, to 25.10. The index, which measures the cost of using
options as insurance against declines in the S&P 500, has risen
for six straight trading days.  “The market is struggling,”  John Praveen , chief
investment strategist at Prudential International Investments
Advisers, a unit of Prudential Financial Inc., which manages
$943 billion in assets, said in a phone interview. “Investors
are extremely nervous about what’s going on in Europe.”  JPMorgan tumbled 9.4 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$33.49. Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  agreed to testify
before a Senate committee on the bank’s loss as lawmakers debate
whether to tighten rules on trading by U.S. lenders. Dimon
announced the loss May 10, assailing his firm’s handling of
trading in synthetic credit positions as “flawed, complex,
poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored.”  Eight Weeks  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  slid 7 percent to $7.02 for an eighth
consecutive weekly decline, the longest run since at least 1980.  The S&P 500  Materials Index (S5MATR)  fell for nine consecutive days,
the longest losing streak since September 2000, as the Dollar
Index rose for a record 14 straight sessions through May 17.  U.S. Steel Corp. plunged 17 percent to $21.56 as hedge-fund
manager  David Einhorn  said at the Ira Sohn conference that he’s
not in favor of the steelmaker. Steel prices will continue to
fall because of a glut of supply, Anthony Rizzuto, an analyst
with Dahlman Rose & Co., wrote in a note on May 15.  Allegheny Technologies Inc. (ATI) , a specialty-metals producer,
declined 16 percent to $33.18.  Retailers Slump  J.C. Penney slumped 23 percent, the most since October 2008
and the biggest decline in the S&P 500, to $26.29. The
department-store chain led by Apple Inc.’s former retailing
chief reported a first-quarter loss and sales that fell more
than analysts projected.  Abercrombie & Fitch sank 23 percent to $35.89, the lowest
level since September 2010. The operator of its namesake and
Hollister stores reported first-quarter revenue that missed
analysts’ estimates and said same-store sales will decline this
fiscal year amid weakness in Europe.  Facebook (FB)  rose 0.6 percent to $38.23 in its debut on the
last day of the week. That compares with Carlyle Group LP’s 0.2
percent day-one increase on May 3, and pales in contrast with
Google Inc.’s 18 percent jump in its 2004 initial public
offering. Underwriters bought Facebook’s stock to keep it from
falling below the IPO price, people with knowledge of the matter
said.  Facebook raised $16 billion in the largest IPO on record
for a technology company. The offering valued the company at 107
times trailing 12-month earnings, more than every S&P 500 member
except Amazon.com Inc. and Equity Residential.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  advanced 5.1 percent, the most in the
Dow, to $62.43. The world’s largest retailer reported first-
quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates as its low prices
increased customer traffic and boosted sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
