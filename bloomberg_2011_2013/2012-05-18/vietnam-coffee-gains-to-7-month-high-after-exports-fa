Coffee prices in  Vietnam , the world’s
biggest producer of the robusta variety, climbed to the highest
level in almost seven months. Exports fell in April.  Beans from the Southeast Asian nation reached 42,000 dong
($2.02) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) yesterday, the highest price
since Oct. 18,  data  from the Dak Lak Trade & Tourism Center
show. Vietnamese coffee exports fell 19 percent to 168,228
metric tons in April from a month earlier, Vietnam’s General
Customs Department said on its website today.  Farmers in Vietnam are unwilling to sell beans below 40,000
dong a kilogram and processors don’t want to pay more, Volcafe,
the coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.,
said in a report e-mailed May 11.  Dak Lak  is Vietnam’s biggest
coffee-producing region.  Robusta coffee for July delivery was up 0.7 percent to
$2,202 a ton by 10:25 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . The
commodity has climbed 21 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
