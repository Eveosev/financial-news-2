The forint slumped, extending the
longest streak of depreciation in more than a year, as the
 European debt crisis  worsened and Hungary struggled to start
talks on a bailout.  Hungary’s currency dropped 0.3 percent to 298.8 per euro by
9:39 a.m. in Budapest in a sixth day of losses, the longest such
streak since April 2011. A close at that level would result in a
weekly slide of 3.1 percent, the most among more than 20
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Demand for riskier assets fell after Moody’s Investors
Service lowered debt ratings at 16 Spanish banks, while  Fitch
Ratings  cut Greece’s credit rating on concern the country may be
unable to sustain euro membership. Hungary is yet to start aid
negotiations six months after Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s
Cabinet asked the International Monetary Fund for help because
he has yet to implement all amendments to a central bank law.  “The Greek turmoil is still the key for global  capital
markets  and the increasing speculation whether they’ll exit the
euro zone,” Levente Blaho and Adam Keszeg, analysts at
 Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , wrote in a research report
today. “The forint has become a regional underperformer, it is
the most exposed to international events.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
