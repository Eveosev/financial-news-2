Treasuries declined, with benchmark
10-year notes snapping a two-day gain.  The yield on the 10-year security climbed three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.73 percent at 9:13 a.m.
in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75
percent security due in May 2022 fell 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000
face amount, to 100 6/32.  Benchmark notes headed for a ninth weekly gain after Moody’s
Investors Service cut the credit ratings of 16 Spanish banks,
citing economic weakness and the government’s mounting budget
strain. Government bonds in Germany and Japan also rallied as
 Fitch Ratings  downgraded Greece on concern the nation's
politicians will fail to adhere to the terms of its bailout
agreements.  ``The U.S. is the favorite safe haven,'' said Hiromasa
Nakamura, who helps oversee the equivalent of $41.4 billion in
Tokyo as an investor for Mizuho Asset Management Co., a unit
of  Japan 's largest publicly traded bank. ``There's a flight to
quality. The world economy is declining. Recently the rally
has gained strength.''  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
