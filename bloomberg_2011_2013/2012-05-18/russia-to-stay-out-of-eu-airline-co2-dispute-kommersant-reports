Russia’s government may stay out of a
dispute between airlines and the European Union on rules about
carbon-dioxide emissions, Kommersant  reported  today, citing an
unidentified government official.  The state may act as an observer, not getting involved as
the airlines oppose the inclusion of aviation in EU’s emissions
trading system, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
