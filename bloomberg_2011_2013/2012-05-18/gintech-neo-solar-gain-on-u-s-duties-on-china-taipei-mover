Taiwan’s second and third-biggest
solar-cell makers gained in Taipei on expectations they may
benefit after the U.S. imposed tariffs of as much as 250 percent
on Chinese equipment.  Gintech Energy Corp. (3514) , the second biggest, surged as much as
5.7 percent to NT$32.55, the highest intraday level since May
10, and traded at $31.55 as of 12:10 p.m. local time.  Neo Solar
Power Corp. (3576)  gained as much as 3.5 percent before trading at
NT$21.40. The benchmark Taiex Index declined 2.2 percent.  The U.S. Commerce Department yesterday ruled that Chinese
companies sold silicon-based cells at prices below the cost of
production and announced preliminary anti-dumping duties ranging
from 31 percent to 250 percent, depending on the manufacturer.
The department sided with companies including the U.S. unit of
 SolarWorld AG (SWV) , which argued that Chinese producers benefit from
government subsidies.  Chinese solar panel-makers such as  Suntech Power Holdings
Co. (STP)  and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , which get 10 to 15 percent of their
sales from the U.S., are likely to buy their cells from
Taiwanese suppliers to circumvent the duty, said Charles Yonts,
an alternative-energy analyst in  Hong Kong  at CLSA Ltd.  “The Taiwanese cell makers are the workaround,” Yonts
said in an e-mail today. “Chinese panel brands can outsource
cell manufacturing to Taiwan to avoid the wrath of U.S.
customs.”  Suntech was told to pay 31.22 percent, Trina’s levies were
set at 31.14 percent and 59 other Chinese companies were told to
pay duties of 31.18 percent. All other Chinese producers
received a rate of 249.96 percent.  LDK Solar Co., a Chinese maker of cells and panels based in
Xinyu, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent
by e-mail to its external public relations company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
