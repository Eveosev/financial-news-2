Rising natural- gas prices  have
provided some relief to  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , which has seen
its shares plummet this year on management controversy and a
looming cash-flow shortfall.  Gas rose to a 13-week high of $2.705 per million British
thermal units on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  today. The
fuel has gained 42 percent since touching a 10-year low last
month of $1.902. Chesapeake, the second-largest U.S. gas
producer, told investors on May 2 that $2 per million Btu gas
prices would result in a loss this year, whereas at $3 the
company would be profitable.  Chesapeake, based in  Oklahoma City ,  rose  6 percent to
$14.36 at the close in New York. The shares are still down 36
percent this year after Chesapeake began a review of Chief
Executive Officer  Aubrey McClendon ’s personal loans backed by
stakes in company wells and said it may run out of cash as early
as next year.  “Every penny in gas price helps,” Biju Perincheril, a New
York-based analyst for Jefferies & Co., said today in an
interview. Today’s gains increased the average gas price for the
year to $2.406. Jefferies forecasts gas will average $2.75 this
year, Perincheril said.  Gas prices will continue to rise until the summer and may
reach as much as $3 per million British thermal units as
companies continue to slow production and electricity producers
switch from coal to gas, Michael A. Hall, a Denver-based analyst
with Robert W. Baird & Co., said in an interview.  It’s unclear if the price increase will last long enough to
help Chesapeake and other gas producers with their cash crunch,
Hall said. He expects prices to rise to $3.75 in 2013.  Futures contracts show gas prices averaging $3.656 in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
