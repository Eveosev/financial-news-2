Straumann Holding AG (STMN)  expects “high”
single-digit market growth by 2020,  Finanz & Wirtschaft 
reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Beat Spalinger.  The world’s biggest maker of dental implants, based in the
Swiss city of Basel, will grow primarily in  emerging markets 
where labor costs are lower, Spalinger was cited as saying.
Straumann sees a stable gross margin, the newspaper reported in
a pre-release of an article.  Spalinger also said that recent share-price developments
are due to the weak market environment in Italy and Spain, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
