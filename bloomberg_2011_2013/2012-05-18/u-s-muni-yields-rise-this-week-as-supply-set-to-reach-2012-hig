Yields in the $3.7 trillion municipal
 bond market  rose for the first time in six weeks as U.S. state
and local governments prepared to sell the most debt this year.  The  yield  on top-rated tax-exempt bonds due in 10 years
increased 0.07 percentage point this week to 1.84 percent at
noon in New York, according to a Bloomberg Valuation Index. The
move follows five straight weekly declines that pushed the rate
to lowest in three months.  State and local issuance totaled $8.1 billion this week,
the biggest amount since the period ended April 20, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. It may rise to about $10.5 billion
next week, which would be the  most  this year, the data show.  “In addition to just hitting that wall of lack of seen
value, there’s pretty hefty supply,” said David Frank, a
managing director in public finance at CastleOak Securities LP
in  New York .  Even with yields near the lows set earlier this year,
investors added about $805 million to muni mutual funds in the
week through May 16, Lipper US Fund Flows data show. It was the
fifth-straight week of inflows and the 23rd of the past 24, the
data show.  The muni market has returned 4.1 percent this year through
yesterday, beating a 1.4 percent increase for Treasuries,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
