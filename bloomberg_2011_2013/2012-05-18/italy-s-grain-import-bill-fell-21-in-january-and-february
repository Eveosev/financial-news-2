Italy’s grain-import bill dropped 21
percent in the first two months of the year compared with the
same period in 2011 as purchases of corn, wheat and barley
declined.  The country’s grain buying fell to 487.5 million euros
($617.1 million) from 616.8 million euros a year earlier, the
Rome-based Associazione Nazionale Cerealisti, known as Anacer,
wrote in an e-mailed statement today. The volume of inbound
grain shipments decreased to 1.68 million metric tons from 2.23
million tons a year earlier, Anacer said.  Soft-wheat imports in January and February fell to 689,270
tons from 834,098 tons a year earlier, the report showed.
Imports of durum wheat, the variety used to make pasta, dropped
to 196,165 tons from 366,024 tons.  Corn imports declined to 387,632 tons from 549,807 tons,
according to Anacer. Barley fell to 104,430 tons from 192,122
tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
