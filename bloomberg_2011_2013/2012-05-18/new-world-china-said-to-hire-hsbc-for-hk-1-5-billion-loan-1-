New World China Land Ltd. (917)  hired HSBC
Holdings Plc to help arrange a HK$1.5 billion ($193 million),
three-year loan, according to three people familiar with the
matter.  New World China Finance Ltd. is the borrowing entity and
the loan is guaranteed by New World China, one of the people
said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private. New World China is a unit of New World Development Co.,
which is seeking a HK$1.9 billion, four-year facility.  A New World China spokeswoman, who declined to give her
full name citing company policy, declined to comment on the loan
when contacted by telephone today.  The loan pays an all-in rate that includes margins and fees
of about 330 basis points over the  Hong Kong  interbank offered
rate for commitments of HK$300 million or more, the people said.
Proceeds will be used to refinance debt, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
