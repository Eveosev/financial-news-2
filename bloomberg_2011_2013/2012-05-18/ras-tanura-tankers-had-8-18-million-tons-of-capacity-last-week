Oil tankers calling at  Ras Tanura  in
 Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest crude-export complex, had a
total capacity of 8.18 million deadweight tons in the week to
May 12, satellite signals from the ships show.  The vessels would be able to carry about 8.57 million
barrels a day based on loading of full cargoes, assuming a
conversion factor of 7.33 barrels a ton. The prior week’s
capacity was 8.40 million tons, or 8.80 million barrels a day.  Some vessels call at other loading ports before or after
Ras Tanura, indicating they may have collected partial cargoes
elsewhere. The Ras Tanura complex, including Ras al-Ju’aymah, is
the largest global crude terminal, according to the website of
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as  Saudi Aramco .  The first table below lists the destination countries of
tankers calling at Ras Tanura in the latest week as of about 9
a.m. London time today. The data are from IHS Inc. The second
shows the deadweight tonnage and carrying capacity in barrels of
tankers that called each week this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
