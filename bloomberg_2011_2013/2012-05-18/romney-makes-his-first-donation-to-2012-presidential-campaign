Presumptive Republican nominee  Mitt Romney , who spent $44.7 million on his 2008 campaign, has made
his first donation to the 2012 White House contest.  Romney and his wife, Ann, each contributed $75,000 to the
joint fundraising committee with the Republican National
Committee earlier this month, according to a Romney aide
speaking on condition of anonymity. The money will be divided
among Romneyâ€™s campaign committee, the national party and state
committees. The contributions will be disclosed publicly in the
June fundraising reports to the  Federal Election Commission .  The candidate and his wife each contributed $2,500 to help
pay off the campaign debts of former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty following his withdrawal from the Republican
presidential race and his subsequent endorsement of Romney.  Romney and President Barack Obama are raising money with
their national and state parties, allowing donors to write
checks that exceed the $5,000 maximum for a candidate committee.
Both candidates have declined to take federal funding for the
general election, making this the first privately funded
presidential race since before Watergate.  The former Massachusetts governor and the  Republican
National Committee  said they raised $40.1 million in April in
their first month of joint fundraising, while Obama and the
 Democratic National Committee  announced that they had raised
$43.6 million. Reports are due at the Federal Election
Commission May 20.  In the 2008 contest, Romney lent his campaign $44.7 million
and then forgave the loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
