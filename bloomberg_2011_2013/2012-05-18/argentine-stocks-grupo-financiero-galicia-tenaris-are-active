nasty days,” Adrian Mayoral, an analyst and trader at Buenos

continue next week as well.” The Merval dropped 7.9 percent

said the overdue tranche of a $1 billion loan to Argentina’s
Petersen Group backed by a stake in YPF is “payable
immediately.” Credit Suisse sent the warning to the company
yesterday, according to a YPF filing to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
