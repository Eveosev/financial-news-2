Nordgold NV, a London-listed Russian
gold producer, fell to the lowest level since its listing after
reporting a 30 percent decline in first-quarter profit from a
year earlier as output dropped.  Global depositary receipts of Nordgold, controlled by
Russian billionaire  Alexey Mordashov , lost 5.7 percent to $5 by
the close in  London , the lowest price on a closing basis since
the shares were listed on Jan. 20.  Net income declined to $60 million from $85 million in the
first quarter of 2011, Nordgold said today in a statement. The
company restated a production decline to 156,200 ounces, or 10
percent. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell 15 percent to $114 million, while revenue rose
8 percent to $264 million, the company said.  “We do not expect Nordgold’s share price to outperform the
sector this year as we see it reporting only moderate
production/financial growth in 2012,” VTB Capital analyst led
by Nikolay Sosnovskiy, said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
