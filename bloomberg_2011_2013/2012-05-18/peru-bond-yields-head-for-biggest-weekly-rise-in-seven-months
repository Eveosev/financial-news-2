Peru’s dollar-denominated bond yields
headed for their biggest weekly increase since September as
European fiscal and political turmoil discouraged demand for
emerging-market assets.  Yields on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar bonds
due in March 2037 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 4.49 percent at 1:30 p.m. in  Lima . They extended their
weekly increase to 14 basis points, the steepest since the five
days ended Sept. 23. The bond’s price has fallen 2.59 cents from
a week ago to 130.66 cents per dollar.  “You have a risk crisis with some levels of contagion with
other countries in the south of Europe,” said  Alejandro Grisanti , an analyst at Barclays Plc in  New York . Investors are
selling assets “to seek refuge in U.S. Treasuries,” he said.  The sol has weakened 0.7 percent to 2.6715 per U.S. dollar
this week and declined 0.1 percent in trading today, according
to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said financial
turmoil may last another two years, adding to concern  Europe ’s
crisis is worsening. Greece’s credit rating was cut one level to
CCC from B- by Fitch Ratings yesterday on concern the
politically deadlocked country may not be able to sustain its
euro membership.  Moody’s Investors Service lowered the debt ratings of 16
Spanish banks yesterday, citing mounting loan losses and a
national recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
