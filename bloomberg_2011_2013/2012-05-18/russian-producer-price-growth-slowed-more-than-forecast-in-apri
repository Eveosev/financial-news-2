Russian  producer-price  growth slowed
more than economists forecast in April.  Prices of goods leaving factories and mines grew 6.7
percent from a year earlier after a 7.4 percent advance in
March, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in an
e-mailed statement. The median  estimate  of 10 economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for a 7 percent increase.  Factory-gate prices rose 0.6 percent in April from a month
earlier after a 2.1 percent gain in March, the service said.
Economists forecast an increase of 1.5 percent, according to the
median of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
