German states are studying setting
content rules for solar power products favoring local producers,
according to the head of  Solarworld AG. (SWV)   Strategies “are being considered by the states,” in talks
with the central government on future industry subsidies,
Solarworld Chief Executive Officer Frank Asbeck said.  Germany should introduce “local content rules similar to
those in Greece or Italy” to help the industry, Asbeck said.
KfW Group, Germany’s state development bank, could offer project
developers better financing when using domestic panels, he said.  Governors voted May 11 to send  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
plan to reduce solar incentives to parliamentary arbitration,
saying it would pressure local manufacturers as Chinese rivals
led by Suntech Power Holdings Co. grab market share. Four German
solar companies including  Q-Cells SE (QCE) , once the world’s biggest
cell maker, have filed for creditor protection since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
