The U.K. Statistics Authority will
decide how housing costs will be incorporated into British
inflation data this fall.  Britain’s Consumer Prices Advisory Committee has
recommended that the so-called rental equivalence method, which
measures the price house owners would need to pay to rent their
home, should be included in a new additional gauge, according to
the  record  of the CPAC’s April 30 meeting, published in  London 
today.  A new index incorporating owner occupiers’ housing costs is
scheduled to be published alongside the existing Consumer Price
Index from March 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
