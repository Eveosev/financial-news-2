Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
country’s second-biggest lender by market value, declined the
most in three weeks on a technical signal which showed the stock
was poised to drop.  KCB, as the lender is known, fell 3.1 percent to 23.75
shillings by 11:02 a.m. in the capital, Nairobi, its biggest
one-day drop since April 26, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A close at that level would be the lowest in a week.  KCB’s 14-day  relative strength index  closed at 71.2 on May
16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A reading above 70
means a security is overvalued and will probably fall. KCB’s RSI
has been above 70 since May 16.  Year to date the stock has risen  43 percent , the fourth
best performing Kenyan stock, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Its first quarter earnings jumped 37 percent as loan income
increased. Net income climbed to 2.43 billion shillings in the
three months through March from 1.77 billion shillings a year
earlier. Net interest income, the money banks earn from interest
charges on loans, surged 35 percent to 6.94 billion shillings,
it said April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
