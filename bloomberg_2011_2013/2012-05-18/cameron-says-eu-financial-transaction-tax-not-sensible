U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ,
speaking ahead of his first meeting with French President
 Francois Hollande , said proposals for a European Union financial
transaction tax are a bad idea.  “I’m very clear, we are not going to get growth in Europe
or Britain by introducing a new tax that would actually hit
people as well as financial institutions,” Cameron told
reporters in Washington, where the two men were due to meet
before heading to the Group of Eight summit at Camp David,
Maryland. “I don’t think it is a sensible measure. I will not
support it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
