weekly drop to 5.2 percent, the steepest decline since the

Mexico as  Europe ’s debt crisis rattled confidence in global

Spanish banks, while  Fitch Ratings  cut Greece’s credit rating on
concern the country may not be able to sustain euro membership.  OHL Mexico SAB (OHLMEX*)  , the Mexican unit of Spanish

construction company, fell 3.3 percent to 19.60 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
