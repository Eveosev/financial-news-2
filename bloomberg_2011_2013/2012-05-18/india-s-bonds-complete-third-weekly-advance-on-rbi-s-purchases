India ’s benchmark bonds completed a
third weekly gain on speculation the central bank’s purchases of
sovereign debt will spur demand.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  bought a total 111.3 billion
rupees ($2.04 billion) of notes maturing in 2018, 2021, 2022 and
2027 today, according to a statement. The monetary authority has
bought a total 209 billion rupees of securities in the fiscal
year that began April 1, seeking to boost cash supply in the
banking system and help the government’s record borrowing
program succeed.  “Liquidity has improved and hopefully the central bank
will continue to buy debt,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-
income trader at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai.  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due November 2021 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this week to 8.53
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate rose three basis points today.  The  finance ministry  sold 150 billion rupees of securities
due in 2020, 2024, 2030 and 2041 at a separate auction today,
part of its record 5.69 trillion rupees borrowing program for
the current fiscal year, according to the central bank.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell eight basis
points this week to 7.98 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
