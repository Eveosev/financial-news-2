The Philadelphia Eagles signed
running back  LeSean McCoy  to a five-year extension after the  Pro
Bowl  selection scored a franchise-record 17 rushing touchdowns
last season.  The 23-year-old McCoy, who had one year remaining on his
rookie deal, will now be under contract with the Eagles through
the 2017 National Football League season, the team announced on
its website.  The new extension includes $20.8 million guaranteed, with a
$45 million maximum,  NFL Network  reported citing an unidentified
person familiar with the team.  “It feels good just to wake up tomorrow and go to work
knowing that the deal is done and it’s over with,” McCoy said
yesterday in a press conference. “I’m not a guy to try and hold
out and do this and do that. I try and do things the right way.
I’m just happy that everything is done and over with, and I can
go to work happy tomorrow and enjoy myself.”  The Eagles picked McCoy in the second round of the 2009  NFL
Draft . Last season he rushed for 1,309 yards with a league-high
17 rushing touchdowns, and was named to his first Pro Bowl.  To contact the reporter on this story:
