BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, may start a new share buyback after this
week trimming an $80 billion spending plan over five years, RBC
Capital Markets said.  “We believe that the company may well embark on a modest
buyback program if cash generation exceeds projected  capital
spending  in a slower world economy,” Des Kilalea and Richard
Hatch, London-based analysts at RBC, said in a report today.  The company won’t meet a spending target issued last year
for building new mines and expanding operations as it sees
prices falling, Chairman Jac Nasser said May 16.  Melbourne-based BHP completed a $10 billion buyback in
Sydney and London last June, six months ahead of schedule. Ruban Yogarajah, a London-based spokesman for BHP, couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
