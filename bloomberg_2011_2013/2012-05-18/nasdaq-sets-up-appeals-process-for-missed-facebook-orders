Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  set up an
appeals process for traders whose  Facebook Inc. (FB)  trades didn’t go
through, giving them a deadline of 5 p.m. New York time to
submit requests.  Nasdaq OMX said traders with questions about orders placed
between 11:11 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. New York time should contact
the exchange operator at +1-212-231-5100.  “Our intention is to reach resolution of those trades
today through an offline matching process,” Nasdaq said in an
e-mailed statement. “If at the end of that process, a firm
continues to have questions or concerns, the firm needs to
submit a formal accommodation request to us through the normal
channels.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
