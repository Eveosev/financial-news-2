Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  plans to
sell as much as 370 billion yen ($4.7 billion) of private
placement bonds, diluting the guarantees that back the utility’s
about 4.3 trillion yen of publicly sold notes.  The facility will include 170 billion yen for refinancing
of existing non-guaranteed debt and 200 billion yen in new
funding, according to three people familiar with the matter.
Tepco, as the company is known, expects to complete the
transaction in July, the people said, declining to be identified
because the details are private.  The deal is part of Tepco’s 1.7 trillion yen financing plan
agreed on earlier this month under Japan’s 1 trillion yen
bailout for the owner of the stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant. Banks, whose loans supported Tepco after the March 11
disaster locked it out of the  bond market , are offering low
interest rate facilities to the utility in exchange for a
repayment guarantee, the people said today.  “The sale may reduce the amount of collateral backing the
company’s existing bonds and that will have to be reflected in
its  credit rating ,” Hiroki Shibata, a Tokyo-based credit
analyst who covers power producers for  Standard & Poor’s , said
in an interview yesterday. The offering may lead S&P to lower
the utility’s B+  rating , he said.  Lenders will include Development  Bank of Japan (8301) ,  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  and the country’s major trust
insurance companies, which will buy the securities and convert
them to loans, the people said.  Bond Pricing  Tepco will sell 200 billion yen of 1 1/2-year securities
and have a choice of six-month, five-, seven- and 10-year notes
for the rest of the funding, the people said. The relative
yields for notes with maturities of five years or more are still
under negotiation and may range from 50 basis points to 60 basis
points, they said.  “Regarding the detail of financings, such as  interest
rates  and private placements, we are continuing to negotiate
with financial institutions,” Tepco’s spokesman Taichi Okazaki
said by telephone today.  The company has 4.3 trillion yen of bonds outstanding,
including 499 billion yen due this year, according to  data
compiled by Bloomberg . The power company also has 3.72 trillion
of long- and short-term loans that aren’t guaranteed, it said
earlier this month.  The extra yield investors demand to own Tepco’s 1 billion
euro of 4.5 percent notes due March 2014 is 533.1 basis points,
down from the peak of 1,743.5 basis points on Oct. 19, BNP
Paribas SA prices show. The spread on the company’s 150 billion
yen of 4.75 percent notes due February 2014 is 490 basis points,
down from a peak of 996 on Oct. 27,  Japan  Securities Dealers
Association prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
