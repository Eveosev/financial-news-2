Tropical Depression Aletta is
swirling at sea today far off  Mexico â€™s southern Pacific coast
with 35 mph winds, and will likely become a remnant low in a day
or so, the National Hurricane Center said.  The Miami-based center also said a nearly stationary low
pressure area several hundred miles south of the Mexican resort
of  Acapulco  has a 40 percent chance of growing into a tropical
cyclone over the next two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
