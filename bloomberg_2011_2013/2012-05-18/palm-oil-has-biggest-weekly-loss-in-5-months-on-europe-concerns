Palm oil  had the biggest weekly
decline in more than 5 months, on concern that Europe’s
worsening crisis may stall global economic growth and cut demand
for commodities.  The August-delivery contract closed little changed at 3,096
ringgit ($988) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. Futures fell 5.5 percent this week, the most since the
five days ended Nov. 25.  Moody’s Investors Service lowered debt ratings at 16
Spanish banks, citing a recession and mounting loan losses.
Greece’s credit rating was reduced one level by  Fitch Ratings  on
concern that the country may not be able to sustain membership
in the euro area. About $4 trillion has been wiped from global
equity markets this month as Europe’s deepening crisis threatens
the global recovery.  “There are concerns that investors will hold back
purchases in view of the uncertainty,” Ivy Ng, an analyst at
 CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) , said by phone in Kuala Lumpur.
“Economies may be growing at a slower rate and demand will be
affected as well.”  Palm oil exports from Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest
producer after Indonesia, rose 0.7 percent to 599,044 tons in
the first 15 days of May from the same period in April, Intertek
said May 15. Shipments fell 7 percent to 564,477 tons in the
period, estimated Societe Generale de Surveillance.  Soybeans for July delivery dropped 0.6 percent to $14.29 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for the same
month fell 0.9 percent to 50.28 cents a pound. Palm oil and
soybean oil are both used in foods and fuels.  Palm oil for September delivery lost 2.2 percent to close
at 7,974  yuan  ($1,260) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
the lowest closing price for the most-active contract since Jan.
18. Soybean oil for the same month retreated 1.4 percent to end
at 9,188 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
