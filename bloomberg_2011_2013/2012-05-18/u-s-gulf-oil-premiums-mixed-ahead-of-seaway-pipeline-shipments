U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums were
mixed ahead of the startup of oil shipments scheduled for this
weekend on  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s
Seaway pipeline.  The 500-mile (805-kilometer), 30-inch line is being
commissioned and will initially be able to deliver 150,000
barrels a day, increasing to more than 400,000 in the first
quarter of 2013, the companies said in a statement yesterday.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil’s  premium  to West Texas
Intermediate was unchanged at $12.25 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg at 12:09 p.m. in New York.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI was unchanged at
$14.25 a barrel.  Mars Blend’s narrowed 15 cents to $10.70 a barrel and
Poseidon’s lost 10 cents to $9.50. Southern Green Canyon’s
premium added 5 cents to $9.90.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 15 cents
against WTI to a premium of $13.80.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$16.25 a barrel. Syncrude’s premium was steady at $1.90.  Bakken oil’s discount to the U.S. benchmark was unchanged
at $2 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
