The global economy is going through
“turbulent, volatile times,” making it hard to assess future
monetary policy moves,  Mexico ’s central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said.  While  Europe ’s debt crisis has weakened the peso, a pick-up
in the U.S. is fueling growth in Mexico, Carstens said in an
interview at a banking convention in Acapulco today.  If U.S. economic growth continues to “surprise,” there is
a possibility of seeing greater expansion in Mexico, he said.
The central bank yesterday raised its estimate for expansion
this year to a range of 3.25 percent to 4.25 percent, up from 3
percent to 4 percent. At the same time, Greece’s debt crisis is
threatening to spread in Europe, weakening the peso.  “We’re living in a turbulent, volatile time and that
certainly makes it difficult to assess what is the most adequate
policy measure,” Carstens said. “The  exchange rate  is very
important, and certainly the depreciation is something that has
held us back, but then there are many other factors that we
consider and certainly it would not be appropriate to say that
is the key factor.”  The peso has declined 4.7 percent against the dollar in the
past month and 15.1 percent in the past year. The currency
strengthened 0.2 percent to 13.8095 at 10:40 a.m. in Mexico
City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
