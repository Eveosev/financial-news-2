Ecuador ’s Attorney General said the
government expects an arbitration panel to reach a decision this
year in a $3.2 billion dispute with  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) ,
the largest onshore crude producer in the continental U.S.  The World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes should rule on the case in three to six
months, Diego Garcia, who represents Ecuador’s government in the
case, said yesterday in a phone interview from Miami. The South
American country is disputing the tribunal’s jurisdiction and
hasn’t decided if it will accept the ruling, Garcia said.  Ecuador stripped Occidental, the biggest foreign investor
in the country at the time, of its oil concession in 2006 over
an alleged contract breach, prompting the company’s complaint to
the panel. The government, which denies responsibility for
damages to Occidental, has asked that the case be thrown out,
Garcia said.  “In the next months, let’s say three or maximum six
months, the arbitration award should be issued,” Garcia said.
“We consider that there is sufficient basis at the moment for
an eventual annulment of the award.”  Occidental spokesman Eric Moses declined to comment
yesterday in an e-mail. Occidental  fell  56 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $78.67 in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
