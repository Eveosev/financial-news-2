The cost of insuring Japanese
corporate debt from default surged to the highest in more than
seven months amid concern  Greece  may have to leave the euro.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index advanced 7 basis points to
218.5 basis points as of 9:27 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The benchmark is on course for its highest close
since Oct. 5, according to data provider CMA. Japanese stocks
 fell , extending the longest streak of weekly losses since the
Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. The nation’s  10-year-note yield 
plunged to the lowest since July 2003.  “The market has priced in the worst case scenario,” which
is Greece’s exit from the  euro zone , Toshiyasu Ohashi, the head
of credit research in Tokyo at Daiwa Securities Co., said today
in a phone interview. The focus is on Greece’s new election
being held in June, he said.  Greece will hold new elections after President Karolos
Papoulias failed to broker a governing coalition following an
inconclusive May 6 vote. The standoff has reignited concern the
country will renege on pledges to cut spending as required by
the terms of its two bailouts worth 240 billion euros ($304
billion) negotiated since May 2010, and, ultimately, leave the
euro area.  Japan ’s government bond yield slid after Fitch Ratings
yesterday downgraded Greece to CCC from B-, citing heightened
risk the nation may not be able to sustain membership in the
monetary union. The yield on the 10-year security fell 3 basis
points to 0.815 percent as of 12:39 p.m. in Tokyo, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Asian stocks fell, erasing this year’s gains. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index decreased 2.1 percent as of 11:55 a.m. in Tokyo
and is down 0.9 percent this year. The Topix index dropped 2.4
percent to 729.06 as of 12:10 p.m. in Tokyo. A rating cut of
Spanish banks further fueled concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
deepening.  The euro dropped to a four-month low, heading for a third
weekly decline.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 8 basis points to 201.5 as of
8:04 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The index is poised to close at its highest since Jan. 16,
CMA prices show.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose 7 basis points to
202 basis points as of 10:18 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The gauge is set for its highest since Nov.
29, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
