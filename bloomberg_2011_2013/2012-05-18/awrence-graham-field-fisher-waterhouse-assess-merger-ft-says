Lawrence Graham and Field Fisher
Waterhouse are assessing a merger that if implemented would put
the combined  law firm  among the top 25 in the U.K. in revenue,
the Financial Times reported, citing Hugh Maule, a managing
partner at Lawrence Graham, and a spokeswoman at Field Fisher.  The combined entity would have 150 million pounds ($237
million) revenue, more than 200 partners, 440 other lawyers and
1,000 employees, the newspaper said.  Field Fisher Waterhouse handles work for regulatory
agencies, while Lawrence Graham has a strong international
presence, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
