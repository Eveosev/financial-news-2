KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper
producer with the biggest European mine output, headed for its
steepest weekly decline in five months as Europe’s debt crisis
intensified and a U.S. manufacturing gauge trailed estimates,
eroding demand for industrial metals.  The shares tumbled as much as 2.6 percent to 116.9 zloty,
and traded 1.1 percent lower as of 10:06 a.m. in Warsaw,
extending this  week’s  loss to 8.4 percent, the biggest since the
five days ended Dec. 16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service lowered debt ratings at 16
Spanish banks, citing a recession and mounting loan losses,
while Greece’s credit rating was reduced one level by  Fitch
Ratings  on concern the country may not be able to sustain
membership in the euro area. Manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region unexpectedly shrank in May, a report showed yesterday.  The benchmark  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  lost 0.7 percent while copper in
London gained 0.8 percent in Warsaw.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
