The  United Nations  will send a fact-
finding mission to  Libya  next week to probe allegations that
mercenaries were used in the conflict that ousted  Muammar Qaddafi  from power and subsequent steps taken by the government.  “In addition to the question of mercenaries, we intend to
obtain direct and first-hand information on the activities of
private companies offering military assistance, consultancy and
security services on the international market, the type of
activities they undertake in Libya and their effect on the
enjoyment of human rights,” Faiza Patel, who heads the group,
said today in an e-mailed statement from Geneva.  Members of the mission, the first to the North African
country by independent experts designated by the UN Human Rights
Council, will speak with Libyan authorities and representatives
of civil society about the regulation of such companies “with
special regard to permits, licensing, vetting and accountability
for human-rights violations,” according to the statement.  The three-day mission starts on May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
