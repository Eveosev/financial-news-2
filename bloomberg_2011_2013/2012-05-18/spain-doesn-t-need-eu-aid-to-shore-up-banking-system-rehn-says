Spain  is taking “very decisive
action” to clean up it savings banks and has the domestic
resources to shore up any banks that need help, European Union
Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn said.  “Spain is not comparable to, for instance, Ireland, which
had a banking sector many times larger compared to gross
domestic product,” Rehn said in a Bloomberg Television
interview in  London  today. “Spain has the starting point that
it can deal with this challenge on its own without resorting to
European assistance.”  Rehn declined to say whether he will recommend on May 30
that the Spanish government be given extra time to meet deficit-
reduction targets due to its recession-hit economy.  Budgets announced yesterday by regional authorities, now
subject to more federal control, “seem to be in line with the
required fiscal targets,” Rehn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
