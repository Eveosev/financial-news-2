Ryan Palmer , the 2011 runner-up,
takes a one-shot lead into today’s second round at golf’s Byron
Nelson Championship.  Palmer, who lives about a 30-minute drive from the TPC Four
Seasons in Irving, Texas, shot a 6-under-par 64 yesterday.
Former U.S.  PGA Tour  Rookie of the Year Marc Leishman from
Australia and Germany’s Alex Cejka are second at 5-under.  “To get back in the same setting with the same people
watching, here where I live, and just to have that feeling
again, this time be the guy standing with the trophy, that’s
been my focus,” Palmer told reporters.  Palmer, who was born in Amarillo, Texas, and lives in
Colleyville, lost in a playoff at the Byron Nelson last year to
Keegan Bradley, who three months later won the U.S.  PGA
Championship  in his rookie season. Bradley is in a group of 13
players at 3-under, a shot behind a posse of seven Americans
including  Matt Kuchar , who won the Players championship five
days ago.  Kuchar, at No. 5, and  Phil Mickelson , at No. 10, are the
only players in the top 10 of the  Official World Golf Ranking  in
the tournament. Mickelson, the 1996 champion who is playing the
event for the first time in five years, is even par.  Palmer, 35, is seeking his fourth victory on the PGA Tour
and first since the 2010 Sony Open.  To contact the reporter on this story:
