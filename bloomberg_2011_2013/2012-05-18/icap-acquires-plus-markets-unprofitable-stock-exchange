ICAP Plc (IAP) , the world’s largest broker
of transactions between banks, said it will pay 1 pound ($1.60)
to buy  Plus Markets Group Plc (PMK) ’s stock exchange, which was
scheduled to close after running out of money.  Plus, which has one of only five U.K. exchange licenses,
will continue to hold conversations with other firms that may be
interested in buying its other units, the London-based company
said in a statement today. ICAP said in a separate statement it
will “continue supporting and expanding” Plus’s stock-listings
business, which is aimed at smaller companies.  “ICAP is well positioned to leverage Plus’ exchange status
to offer new products and solutions for its customers including,
in time, listed  derivatives,” the brokerage said.  Set up by former London Stock Exchange Plc executives, Plus
sought to compete with LSE, and was granted exchange status in
2007. Still, it was unable to attract sufficient listings to be
profitable or draw trading away from LSE, unlike other new
entrants such as Bats Global Markets and Chi-X Europe Ltd.  Plus was being wound down over the next six months after
failing to find a buyer. Companies listed on the exchange’s
markets were told they needed to find an alternative venue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
