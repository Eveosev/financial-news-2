The football champions of the
 Southeastern Conference  and the Big 12 Conference will meet in a
postseason bowl game for at least five years beginning with the
2014 season, the conferences announced yesterday.  The conference champions will meet unless one or both are
selected to play in the new four-team playoffs used to determine
the national champion. Another conference team would replace one
chosen for those playoffs.  “The creation of this game featuring the champions of the
Big 12 and SEC will have tremendous resonance in college
football,” said acting Big 12 Conference Commissioner Chuck Neinas.  During the 14-year history of the Bowl Championship Series,
the Big 12 and SEC lead the nation with 11 seasons in which each
conference has had at least one team ranked in the top four of
the final BCS standings.  “A new January bowl tradition is born,” SEC Commissioner
Mike Slive said in a statement released by the conferences.  To contact the reporter on this story:
