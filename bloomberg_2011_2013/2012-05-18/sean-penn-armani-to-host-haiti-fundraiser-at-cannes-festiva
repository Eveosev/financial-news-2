Actor  Sean Penn  and fashion designer
 Giorgio Armani  will host a fundraising dinner for victims of
Haiti’s earthquake at the  Cannes Film Festival  tonight.  The January 2010 quake killed 300,000 people and left tens
of thousands of others wounded and homeless. Penn was among
personalities who flew over to offer emergency assistance, and
he then founded a charity called the  J/P Haitian Relief
Organization , or J/P HRO.  Proceeds will go to that charity and to two others active
in Haiti:  Artists for Peace and Justice , founded by Canadian
writer-director  Paul Haggis , and  Happy Hearts Fund , founded by
the Czech model Petra Nemcova.  The French festival is allowing the gala to take place in a
hall of its main building. Armani will present it.  “This is a place that, within the next five years, can show
such incredible potential for turnaround,” Penn said at a Cannes
news conference, sitting next to Nemcova and Haggis. “If you
don’t get involved with it, boy are you going to miss
something.”  Penn said there were still 450,000 people displaced by the
earthquake, down from 1.8 million, in a place only “an hour and
a half from Miami.” Camps lacked electricity, water or plumbing,
and the rainy season, which just started, spelled “horror.”  Penn, who wore a black sweater and suit over a white shirt,
said  Haiti , as “a showplace of green technologies,” could be a
“very tangible success story” and no longer be defined as the
poorest country in the Western hemisphere, a hotbed of
narcotrafficking and a place that generated illegal migration.  To contact the reporter on the story:
