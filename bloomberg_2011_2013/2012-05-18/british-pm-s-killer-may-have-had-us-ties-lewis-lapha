“Oh, murder!” said British Prime
Minister Spencer Perceval as he stumbled and fell.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  He had just entered the lobby of Parliament, where a tall
man with a hidden pistol was waiting. The killer stood in
Perceval’s path and fired point blank into his chest,
pulverizing his ribs, breast and heart. It was May 11, 1812.  The only British prime minister to be assassinated,
Perceval enjoyed almost autocratic power and presided over a
“political ice age.” According to Andro Linklater, author of
“Why Spencer Perceval Had to Die,” he was a man of fixed
convictions, sure of his own righteousness.  John Bellingham, his killer, was also such a man. A
merchant with a grievance against the government, he acted in
the name of justice and believed he’d be acquitted when the
world learned the truth.  He was tried and hanged a week later. But the conspiracy
theories never died, and among Bellingham’s suspected paymasters
was American businessman Elisha Peck.  I spoke with Linklater on the following topics:  1. Extreme Positions  2. Starvation and Riots  3. Stalking the Prime Minister  4. “Oh, murder!”  5.
