Going into the NATO Summit this weekend, the U.S. can celebrate some good news:  Pakistan  has  reopened  a route for the first time in six months that allowed containers of  supplies for the U.S. embassy in Kabul to pass through to Afghanistan. Pakistan closed all supply roads after U.S.-led airstrikes along the border  killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers  on Nov. 25, 2011. Before opening them, Pakistan wanted an apology from the U.S. for the attack that many Pakistanis saw as intentional. Details of a deal to lift a blockade against NATO supplies passing through Pakistan roads are still being worked out, but an agreement  seems imminent . Since November, supply trucks for the U.S. and NATO missions have had to take a circuitous northern route to  Afghanistan  through  Russia  and Central Asia, which cost  2.5 times more  than just going through Pakistan. The agreement will likely come without an official U.S. apology. While Bloomberg View  supported the  idea of the U.S. secretary of Defense making one, the closest the U.S. came was the Pentagon's Dec. 22 statement that  expressed  its "deepest regret" and "sincere condolences" over the killings. Whether or not the U.S. should apologize, the Wall Street Journal  reported today , is something that tormented the Obama administration: Some diplomats said it would help mend relations; other policymakers felt it would show weakness. (The debate was complicated by a political environment in which Republicans are eager to label President  Barack Obama  as an  apologist .) The attack roiled Pakistan's parliament, adding to frustration over U.S. use of drones and covert activity in the country. In April, it  passed resolutions  aimed at limiting such U.S. activity. While NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen made it  sound as if  reopening the routes would be a condition for Pakistan's involvement in NATO's summit, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari's spokesman stressed that  it wasn't . But still, the final deal seems close. If it officially comes off, the U.S. and its NATO allies regain valuable supply routes during spring fighting season in Afghanistan, and Pakistan is, among other things, set to receive a payout of  $1.3 billion  for support funds the U.S. had withheld. But while this is a relief, the U.S. should not forget the pain it took to get to this resolution, and the seemingly  intractable animosity  within the  Pakistani populace . Repairing the relationship is good. Better yet would be for the U.S. to get to a point where it's no longer strategically essential.
