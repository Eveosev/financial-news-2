Electricite de France SA is  CEZ AS (CEZ) ’s
favored candidate for a strategic partner in the construction of
two new nuclear reactors at the Temelin power station,  E15 
reported on its website without citing anyone.  Companies from  China ,  Russia  and  South Korea  have also
contacted the Czech utility and expressed interest in co-
financing the project, daily Hospodarske Noviny said today. CEZ
plans to hold a public tender for a strategic partner only after
it chooses a supplier next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
