The Miami Heat canceled practice and
media availability for players and coaches today after their
worst loss of the playoffs left them trailing the  Indiana Pacers 
in their second-round National Basketball Association series.  The team announced the cancellations on its media Twitter
page. No reason was given for the decision.  The Heat trail the Pacers 2-1 in the best-of-seven series
after last night’s 94-75 loss in Indianapolis. Miami guard
Dwyane Wade, an eight-time All-Star, scored five points on 2-
of-13 shooting and had an angry exchange with coach Erik Spoelstra during a timeout.  “That was during a very emotional part of the game, we
were getting our butt kicked, those exchanges happen all the
time,” Spoelstra said. “We just came out with a very flat,
inefficient third quarter and it snowballed from there.”  The Heat have lost both games since forward  Chris Bosh  was
sidelined with an abdominal strain.  The teams return to the Pacers’ Bankers Life Fieldhouse on
May 20 for Game 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
