A unilateral rejection of bailout
terms by  Greece  would be a “catastrophe” that would
“unavoidably” lead the country out of the euro area and
possibly the European Union, former Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said.  “We are, once again, at a critical crossroads,” the
former European Central Bank vice president said in an  open
letter  to the Greek people posted yesterday on the website of
the prime minister’s office. “The decisions that we make in
these burdened times could mark Greece’s course for decades.”  Papademos, who as  Bank of Greece  governor oversaw the
country’s accession to the 17-nation currency bloc, became
interim prime minister in November to implement Greece’s
sovereign-debt restructuring, the largest in history, and secure
a 130 billion-euro ($165 billion) financing package from the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  Panagiotis Pikrammenos was sworn in as head of a caretaker
government on May 16, replacing Papademos, to steer the country
to repeat elections next month after a May 6 poll failed to
yield a viable government. Alexis Tsipras, whose Syriza party
was catapulted to second place on May 6, has called for a
rejection of Greece’s bailout terms.  Greece must carry out the structural economic reforms
demanded by the program to maintain its place in the EU’s core,
Papademos said in his letter. Reform efforts already made during
the country’s financial crisis, which began more than two years
ago, haven’t been in vain, and any effort to amend the country’s
program should be made in a “spirit of cooperation with our
European partners,” he said.  “At a time when many countries, including in our
neighborhood, are working hard to win a place in the EU, it
would be tragic for us to end up in a reverse direction toward
the exit,” Papademos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
