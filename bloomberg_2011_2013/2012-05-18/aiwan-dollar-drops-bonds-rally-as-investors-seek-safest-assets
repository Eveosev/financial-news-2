Taiwan’s dollar had the biggest
weekly drop since September and  government bonds  rallied as
 Europe ’s debt crisis spurred investors to seek the safest assets.  Global funds sold $1.1 billion more local stocks than they
bought this week, according to exchange data. The Bloomberg-
JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index of regional currencies fell for a
sixth consecutive day after  Fitch Ratings  cut  Greece ’s credit
rating to CCC from B-.  “The market’s focus is back on Europe,” said George Pu, a
Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Sinopac Securities Corp.
“People are worried that Europe’s crisis will drag down
Taiwan’s economic growth.”  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.7 percent this week and 0.2
percent today to NT$29.63 against its U.S. counterpart,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.67 earlier, the
weakest level since Feb. 2.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings traders use to price options, surged 193
basis points, or 1.93 percentage points, this week and 66 basis
points today to 6.23 percent, and touched a five-month high of
6.75 percent earlier.  Exports dropped 6.4 percent in April from a year earlier
following a 3.2 percent contraction in March, official data
showed on May 7.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 fell two basis points this week and one basis point today
to 0.955 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.506 percent for the week, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
