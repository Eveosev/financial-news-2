The offices of a Turkish cartoon
magazine that’s often critical of the government and Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who has sued the publication for
insult many times, have been torched by arsonists, Hurriyet
 reported .  Unidentified people set fire to a liquid chemical they
brought to the building where Penguen is located on May 3, while
cartoonists Metin Ustundag and Ercan Genc were still working in
their office, Istanbul’s fire department said in a May 10 report,
according to the newspaper. Prosecutors will investigate the
arson following the report, Hurriyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
