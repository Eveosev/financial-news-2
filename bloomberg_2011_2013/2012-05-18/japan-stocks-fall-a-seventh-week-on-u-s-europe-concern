Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index capping the longest streak of weekly losses since the Sept.
11 attacks in 2001, as exporters declined after U.S. economic
data missed estimates and a rating cut of Spanish banks fueled
concern Europe’s debt crisis is deepening.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics
that depends on Europe and the U.S. for 38 percent of its sales,
fell 5.3 percent.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305)  led
machinery makers lower after industry bellwether Caterpillar Inc.
said its sales growth slowed.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,
Japan’s third-largest bank by market value, paced losses among
lenders, dropping 3.4 percent after Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded 16 Spanish banks.  The Topix index fell 2.9 percent to 725.54 as of the 3 p.m.
trading close in Tokyo, capping its biggest daily loss since Aug.
5. The measure fell 4.3 percent this week, its seventh week of
decline. It has dropped for seven straight weeks only twice
since November 1977 -- in 2001 and 1995. About eight stocks fell
for each that rose.  “Shares are under heavy sell-off pressure across the board
amid pessimism about earnings,” said Kazuyuki Terao, chief
investment officer of RCM Japan Co. “Yesterday’s news out of
the U.S. countered the view the economy is doing OK and dimmed
the outlook, taking away yet another supporting factor for the
market.”  Year’s Biggest Drop  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  lost 3 percent to 8,611.31,
the biggest one-day drop since Aug. 5. The gauge is down 3.8
percent on the week. Trading volume was 21 percent above the 30-
day average. The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 25 percent to
28.56, the highest since November 2011, indicating traders
expect a swing of 8.2 percent on the benchmark gauge over the
next 30 days.  The Topix Index retreated 17 percent from this year’s high
on March 27 as  China ’s economic growth slowed and on renewed
concern about Europe’s debt crisis. The political gridlock after
an inconclusive election last week reignited fears  Greece  will
renege on austerity pledges required for 240 billion euros ($304
billion) in aid and exit the euro.  Stocks on the Topix are  valued  at 0.86 times book value,
compared with 2.06 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 and 1.33 for
the Stoxx  Europe  600. A value of less than one means investors
can buy companies for less than the value of their assets.  BOJ Response  Falling shares add pressure on  the Bank of Japan  to deploy
further monetary stimulus to help the nation’s economy recover
from last year’s natural and nuclear disasters. The central bank,
which expanded its asset purchase program twice this year as
well as setting an inflation goal of 1 percent, is scheduled to
wrap up its policy meeting on May 23.  “While BOJ officials are probably thinking they’ve done
their part after loosening policy in April, the market may
disagree,” said Terao at RCM, which oversees about $138 billion
globally, according to its website. “The BOJ’s action didn’t
make much of an impact as the global market downturn weighed on
the economic outlook. I don’t expect them to move this time.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent
today. The index dropped 1.5 percent to a four-month low in  New
York  yesterday, when reports showed U.S. jobless claims were
unchanged at 370,000 last week and the Bloomberg Consumer
Comfort Index fell in the week ended May 13 to minus 43.6, a
level associated with recessions or their aftermaths.  Makers of electronics and cars accounted for about a third
of the Topix’s decline today. Sony fell 5.3 percent to 1,100 yen,
and  Asia ’s biggest carmaker  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  dropped 3.7
percent to 3,030 yen.  Spanish Banks  Shares also fell as  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  was among 16 Spanish
banks whose credit ratings were cut by Moody’s, which cited
economic weakness and the government’s mounting budget strain.
Greece’s credit rating was downgraded one level by  Fitch Ratings 
on concerns the country won’t be able to muster the political
support needed to sustain its membership in the euro area.  Banks fell. Mizuho Financial Group declined 3.4 percent to
115 yen.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest
lender, slid 3.4 percent to 339 yen.  Machinery makers dropped after Caterpillar said global
machinery retail sales rose 12 percent in the three months
through April, down from an 18 percent rise in the quarter
through March. Hitachi Construction slumped 9.6 percent to 1,487
yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , Japan’s largest construction machinery maker,
dropped 5.7 percent to 1,879 yen.  Stocks fell even after the 25-day  Toraku index , which
compares advancing and declining shares on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, had fallen below 70, a level some traders take to
signal that shares have dropped too far. The time may not be
right for a turnaround, said Yutaka Miura of Mizuho Securities,
a unit of Japan’s second-biggest bank by assets.  “The Nikkei may have further to fall as investors are
becoming more risk-off amid revived concern over Greece and
Europe,” Miura said. “In recent years, the Toraku buy signal
has shifted toward 60 from 70 in some cases so there could be
more room to fall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
