The world’s richest people lost a
combined $32.8 billion this week as concerns over a possible
Greek exit from the euro area pushed the Standard & Poor’s 500
index to its biggest weekly loss since November 2011.  Mexican  Carlos Slim , 72, lost the most during the week, as
shares of his Mexico City-based telecommunications company
America Movil SAB fell 4.38 percent. Slim, who lost $4.1
billion, remains the world’s richest person with a $65.5 billion
fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  co-founder  Mark Zuckerberg , 28, became the
26th richest person on Earth after the world’s most popular
social network raised $16 billion in an initial public offering
May 17. The company’s shares stalled in their public debut May
18, rising 23 cents above the IPO price of $38. Zuckerberg is
worth $19.4 billion.  “Given the hype and excitement, people expected it to be a
lot higher,”  Herman Leung , an analyst at Susquehanna Financial
Group, said in a telephone interview from his San Francisco
office May 18. “This is similar to Google. The company will not
get the benefit until they start proving themselves as a public
company.”  The  S&P 500  fell 4.3 percent to 1295.22 during the week as
Greece failed to form a government and Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded 16 Spanish banks, citing a recession and mounting
loan losses. The S&P 500 is down almost 9 percent since April 2.  Gates, Buffett  Bill Gates  ranks second on the index with a net worth of
$59.1 billion -- $6.4 billion behind Slim. Gates’s nest egg
dropped 4.4 percent as shares of Redmond, Washington-based
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  fell 5.45 percent during the week.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. chairman  Warren Buffett , 81, is the
third richest person in the world. His fortune fell $1.1 billion
to $44.6 billion. On May 17, Berkshire agreed to pay $142
million for Media General Inc.’s 63 community-focused
newspapers.  “I think there is a future for newspapers that exist in an
area where there’s a sense of community,” Buffett said at
Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 5.
Berkshire shares fell 2.4 percent this week.  Facebook Debut  Most of the fortunes of Zuckerberg’s Facebook co-founders
remained unchanged Friday in  New York  trading. Dustin Moskovitz,
27, who started Facebook with Zuckerberg from their dorm room at
 Harvard University , owns 133.7 million shares of the company’s
Class B stock worth $5.1 billion.  Eduardo Saverin, 30, has a $2 billion stake. According to a
regulatory filing dated May 17, he owns 53.1 million shares of
the company.  Co-founder Christopher Hughes, 28, fell short of becoming a
billionaire. He owns about 22 million shares of Facebook,
according to a person familiar with his holdings who asked not
to be named because the matter is private. His stake is worth
$840 million.  Hughes, who bought the Washington, D.C.-based magazine the
New Republic in March 2012 for less than $5 million, has more
than $100 million in cash and real estate after selling some of
his Facebook hoard, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sean Parker , who persuaded Zuckerberg to move to California
to focus on the company full time in 2004, owns 66 million
Facebook shares worth $2.5 billion.  Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, 42, who
was lured from Google in 2008, owns 27 million shares, including
25 million restricted stock units that have vested. They are
valued at $1 billion.  Arnault Wealth Reduced  The net worth of  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) 
chairman  Bernard Arnault  was lowered $15 billion on the index
May 17 because of the way he owns his stake in the world’s
largest luxury-goods company.  France’s richest man, 63, controls 46.5 percent of LVMH’s
share capital, according to the 2011 annual report of the Paris-
based maker of Louis Vuitton handbags and Moet & Chandon
champagne. That figure includes 5.55 percent of LVMH shares held
by Arnault, and a 40.9 percent stake of the company owned by
publicly traded  Christian Dior SA. (CDI)   Arnault only owns 70.4 percent of  Christian Dior , according
to French regulatory filings. The remaining 29.6 percent of Dior
is held by outside investors. While he controls all the voting
power of Dior’s stake in LVMH, his economic interest is less
than the figure reported in the LVMH annual report.  Arnault’s new net worth calculation represented the biggest
wealth re-evaluation since March 5, when Bloomberg began
tracking the fortunes of the world’s richest people daily. He is
worth $23.5 billion.  The  Bloomberg Billionaires Index  takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
every business day at 5:30 p.m. in New York and listed in U.S.
dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
