Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s largest energy
company, canceled nine shipments of liquefied natural gas to
Argentina because the government breached contracts following
the seizure of oil producer  YPF SA. (YPFD)   The shipments scheduled for delivery this year were
canceled because state-owned energy company Energia Argentina SA
failed to meet terms of the agreement, Repsol spokesman Kristian Rix said today in a telephone interview from Madrid, declining
to provide details. Repsol “reserves itself the right to seek
damages” for the cancellation of the shipments, he said.  Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  ordered
the seizure of 51 percent of YPF owned by Repsol on April 16,
claiming the Madrid-based company didn’t invest enough to
increase output. Repsol said it invested $20 billion in YPF
since buying the company in 1999.  Argentina will need about 80 shipments of LNG in 2012 to
meet its energy demand, 60 percent more than last year, Enarsa
said in November.  Repsol had canceled one LNG shipment to the South American
country last month following the nationalization of YPF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
