The Securities Commission of  Zimbabwe 
will investigate the sale of  Murray & Roberts Zimbabwe Ltd. (MR)  to
Zumbani Capital (Pvt) Ltd., said Tafadzwa Chinamho, the
regulatory authority’s chairman.  “We’re probing that deal following complaints from some
minority shareholders, brokers and foreign investors,” Chinamho
said in a phone interview from Harare today.  Zumbani Capital bought 47 percent of Murray & Roberts
Zimbabwe for 1.47 U.S. cents a share, 79 percent less than the
last traded price of 7 cents.  Zumbani Capital is owned by Zimbabwean investors including
the current chairman and the previous chief executive officer of
Murray & Roberts Zimbabwe, Ed Jardim, a spokesman for  Murray &
Roberts Holdings Ltd. (MUR) , said in an e-mailed response to questions
on May 3. Murray & Roberts Zimbabwe is a unit of Murray &
Roberts Holdings.  Paddy Zhanda, former Murray & Roberts Zimbabwe chairman,
and Canada Malunga, the company’s chief executive officer
acquired a “significant stake” in the company, alongside
closely held South African company Carlmac Steel and  Brait SE (BAT) ,
the  Zimbabwe Independent said  May 10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
