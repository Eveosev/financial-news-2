Statoil ASA (STL)  said its Snohvit
liquefied natural gas export plant in Norway’s Barents Sea has
shut down for planned maintenance.  The facility will undergo three weeks of work this month
and a second period lasting a week in June, Ola Anders Skauby, a
spokesman for the Stavanger-based company, said in an e-mail.  Snohvit is the only liquefaction plant in  Europe . It can
produce 4.3 million metric tons of LNG a year, according to
Statoil’s website. The chilled gas is sent to Cove Point in
Maryland and to  Spain  under contracts totaling 3 million tons,
Poten & Partners Inc. data show. GDF Suez SA buys a further 0.5
million tons a year and Total SA 0.8 million tons. Cargoes from
Norway have been shipped as far as  Japan , IHS Inc. data show.  The work includes drying out moisture in the gas line to
the plant, Skauby said. The link from the  gas field  to the
liquefaction site will be cleaned and inspected by a remote-
controlled Pipeline Inspection Gauge, or pig.  “During the production halt various maintenance and
modification work that requires a plant shut down will be
performed,” he said.  Statoil owns 33.5 percent of Snohvit and operates the
plant. Petoro AS holds 30 percent, Total 18.4 percent, GDF Suez
12 percent, Amerada Hess Corp. 3.3 percent and RWE AG 2.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
