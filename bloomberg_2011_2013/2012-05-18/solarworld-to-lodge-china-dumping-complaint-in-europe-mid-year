Solarworld AG (SWV) ,  Germany ’s biggest
solar-panel maker, will bring an antidumping complaint against
Chinese rivals in  Europe  by mid-year after action in the U.S.
led to duties being imposed on imports from the Asian country.  The U.S. decision “is a first step so that we can return
to fair competition based on technology,” Chief Executive
Officer Frank Asbeck said today by phone. “It’s a signal for
Europe, where we plan to file a similar complaint at mid-year.”  The U.S. Commerce Department yesterday imposed preliminary
antidumping duties from 31 percent to 250 percent depending on
the company after ruling Chinese manufacturers sold products
below cost. The ruling followed complaints from the industry
including the U.S. unit of Solarworld.  The companies argued Chinese peers such as Suntech Power
Holdings Co., the world’s largest solar-panel maker, and  Trina
Solar Ltd. (TSL)  are benefiting from government subsidies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
