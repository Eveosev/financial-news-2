England bowled out West Indies for
243 in their opening cricket Test as  Stuart Broad  took a career-
best seventh wicket with the first ball on day two.  Shannon Gabriel, making his Test debut, edged to Graeme
Swann at second slip to end the visitors’ first innings at
Lord’s in London. Broad, who was 7-72, had Fidel Edwards caught
by Matt Prior with the final ball yesterday.  Shivnarine Chanderpaul finished an unbeaten 87 for West
Indies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
