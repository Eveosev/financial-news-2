U.K. house prices will fall for a
second year in 2012 before a “modest recovery” in the
following few years, Barclays said.  British home values will decline 0.3 percent this year
after slipping 0.2 percent in 2011, London-based Barclays
economistChris Crowe said in an e-mailed note to clients today.
Prices will rise an average of 4.1 percent annually in the five
years through 2016, Crowe said.  “We expect the U.K. housing market to remain anaemic in
the near term,” the economist said. “We expect a modest
recovery in the next few years as these downwards pressures
start to dissipate and prices make up some of the ground lost –-
particularly in real terms –- since 2010.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
