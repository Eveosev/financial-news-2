The index has lost 2.4 percent over the past five days and is
headed for its worst week since Nov. 4.  The following are among the most active equities in the

267.40, the lowest in more than seven months. Standard & Poor’s
GSCI index of commodities declined as much as 0.8 percent, a
third day of losses. Separately, the stock was downgraded to

company, slid 1 percent to 255.55 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , the third-largest producer
of the metal, rose for a third day, advancing 1.5 percent to

made from coal, declined for a third day, dropping 1.2 percent
