Morocco ’s wheat harvest will plunge
53 percent in the next season as dry weather curbs output, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service
said in a  report  today.  Production in the year that starts on July 1 will fall to
2.7 million metric tons from 5.8 million tons a year earlier,
according to the report. The amount of rain from September
through April was 55 percent less than a year earlier, the USDA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
