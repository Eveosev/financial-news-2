A license held by  Ericsson AB (ERICB)  to test
long-term evolution wireless technology in Turkey was canceled
because the Swedish company violated liability requirements, the
market regulator said today.  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) , Turkey’s biggest mobile
operator, is “understood to have conducted LTE tests with the
license granted to Ericsson,” the Ankara-based watchdog said on
its  website . LTE is a new wireless standard that provides faster
access to the Web.  The license granted to Ericsson on Jan. 3 gave the company
a year to conduct tests in six locations in Turkey, the
regulator said. It was canceled after the Stockholm-based
company failed to comply with liability provisions “despite
warnings.”  The regulator will also investigate Turkcell, which doesn’t
have its own license to conduct LTE tests, it said. A Turkcell
spokesman declined to comment. Ericsson’s  Turkey  office didn’t
answer calls seeking comment.  Alcatel-Lucent, based in Paris, and Nokia Siemens Networks
hold similar licenses in Turkey, according to the regulator.  To contact the reporters on this story:
