Greece’s June election is a vote on
the country’s euro membership,  Wolfgang Franz , head of
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s council of economic advisers, told
the  Rheinische Post .  A decision to leave the euro area would trigger a collapse
of consumer spending and corporate investment, a rapid increase
in unemployment and many Greeks would lose a large part of their
savings, Franz told the newspaper.  Greece can only remain a euro member if the government
honors its part of the economic adjustment program, he also told
the newspaper.  Franz added that the contagion effects of a Greek euro exit
wouldn’t be as dramatic and unpredictable as two years ago,
