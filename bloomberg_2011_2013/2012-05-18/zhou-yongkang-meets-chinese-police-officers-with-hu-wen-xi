Zhou Yongkang, China’s top internal
security official, met with “model” police officers from
around the nation in Beijing today together with President Hu
Jintao, Premier  Wen Jiabao  and Vice President  Xi Jinping , the
official Xinhua News Agency  reported .  Zhou, speaking at the meeting, said that public security
agencies nationwide and most police officers understand the
complexity of current domestic and international situations, as
well as the “special importance” of maintaining social
stability this year, according to Xinhua. China is preparing for
a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year.  Xinhua’s account of the meeting today follows a May 13
report by the Financial Times that Zhou’s power was curbed
because of his alleged lobbying on behalf of ousted Politburo
member Bo Xilai. Bo, who had been a candidate for promotion to
the China’s top decision making body, was suspended from the
Politburo amid allegations his wife was involved in the murder
of U.K. citizen Neil Heywood.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
