Captain  Andrew Strauss ’s first
century in 18 months helped England take a 16-run lead at the
end of the second day of the opening cricket Test against West
Indies.  Strauss is 121 not out as the hosts reached 259-3 at stumps
at Lord’s in London. It was his 20th career century and the
first since his second-innings 110 in the first Ashes Test in
Australia in November 2010.  “It’s been a little while coming,” Strauss said on Sky
Sports. “I had to dig pretty deep and work pretty hard, but
luckily it come together today.”  Strauss and Jonathan Trott, who scored 58, combined for a
147-run second wicket stand that left England on 194-2.  Kevin Pietersen  was caught on 32 by Denesh Ramdin off the bowling of
Marlon Samuels.  Alastair Cook  was bowled on 26 by Kemar Roach.  Ian Bell  replaced Pietersen, and was unbeaten on 5 at
the end of the day.  England bowled West Indies out for 243 in the morning
session as  Stuart Broad  took a career-best seventh wicket with
the day’s first ball.  Shannon Gabriel, making his Test debut, edged to Graeme Swann at second slip to end the visitors’ innings. Broad, who
was 7-72, had Fidel Edwards caught by Matt Prior with the final
ball yesterday.  Shivnarine Chanderpaul finished an unbeaten 87 for West
Indies.  England is undefeated in its last 12 Tests at Lord’s since
losing the 2005 Ashes Test at the venue.  West Indies hasn’t won an overseas Test in a country other
than bottom-ranked  Bangladesh  since winning in South Africa in
December 2007. The Caribbean team hasn’t won an away series
against anyone other than Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in 17 years.  To contact the reporter on this story: Bob Bensch at
