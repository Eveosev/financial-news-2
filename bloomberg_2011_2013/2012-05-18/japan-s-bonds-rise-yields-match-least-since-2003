Japanese government bonds rose,
pushing benchmark yields to the lowest level since July 2003, as
concern deepened that  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  The  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s so-called Rinban operation saw a
shortfall of offers to sell for first time since 2006,
highlighting demand for government debt.  Fitch Ratings  cut

“Investors have no choice but to buy JGBs.”  The yield on the 10-year security slid three basis points
to 0.815 percent as of 12:30 p.m. in  Tokyo , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-year rates declined 4 1/2 basis
points to 1.57 percent and five-year yields dropped two basis
points to 0.215 percent, the lowest since October 2010.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery rose 0.31 to 143.56
in Tokyo, after touching 143.63, the most for a so-called lead
contract since Oct. 21, 2010.  Japan’s  Topix Index (TPX)  of shares sank 2.5 percent, wiping out
its gain in 2012, while the yen traded at 79.44 per dollar. The

to sell debt with less than one year to maturity, below the
central bank’s target to buy 310 billion yen in the securities.

offers to sell on May 16, the first time since the program began
in October 2010.  Japan Post  Japan Post  Insurance Co., the nation’s biggest life
insurer, plans to cut purchases of domestic government debt by
40 percent this fiscal year and buy more municipal and corporate
bonds.  The unit of Japan Post Holdings Co., which has about 93
trillion yen in assets, will reduce investments in Japanese
 government bonds  by 2.1 trillion yen to 3.1 trillion yen from
the year that ended in March, said Mitsuya Watanabe, general
manager at the investment planning department in Tokyo.  Purchases of municipal bonds and corporate debt will

overseas debt, mainly  U.S. Treasuries , will rise fourfold to 200
billion yen, according to Watanabe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
