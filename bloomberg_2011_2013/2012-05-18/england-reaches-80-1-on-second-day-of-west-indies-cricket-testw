Captain Andrew Strauss led England to
80-1 at lunch of the second day of the opening cricket Test with
West Indies at Lord’s in London.  Strauss on 31, and Jonathan Trott, on 17, were batting at
the break.  Alastair Cook  was bowled by Kemar Roach on 26.  The hosts trail by 163 runs after bowling out West Indies
for 243 in the morning session.  Stuart Broad  took a career-best
seventh wicket with the first ball.  Shannon Gabriel, making his Test debut, edged to Graeme
Swann at second slip to end the visitors’ first innings. Broad,
who was 7-72, had Fidel Edwards caught by Matt Prior with the
final ball yesterday.  Shivnarine Chanderpaul finished an unbeaten 87 for West
Indies.  England is undefeated in its last 12 Tests at Lord’s since
losing the 2005 Ashes Test at the venue.  West Indies hasn’t won an overseas Test in a country other
than bottom-ranked  Bangladesh  since winning in South Africa in
December 2007. The Caribbean team hasn’t won an away series
against anyone other than Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in 17 years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
