European stocks  fell for a fifth day,
posting their biggest weekly selloff since September, amid signs
of slowing growth in  China  and continued concern that Greece
will have to leave the euro area.  Rio Tinto  Group and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  led mining companies and
carmakers lower. Industrial goods companies retreated after
Caterpillar Inc. reported slowing sales.  London  Stock Exchange
Group Plc paced rising shares after reporting that second-half
profit quadrupled.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  slid 1.1 percent to 238.88 at
the close in London. The equity benchmark slumped 5.2 percent
this week and  7.2 percent so far this month . That would be the
largest monthly drop since last August.  “On a medium-term view, there is certainly valuation
support for equities, particularly relative to  government bonds 
which have now hit quite remarkable levels,” said Bill Dinning,
an investment strategist at Kames Capital in Edinburgh which
oversees about $79 billion. “However, that doesn’t help much in
terms of timing. Obviously, we are back in a situation where the
euro area is having an existential crisis.”  The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 1.1 percent yesterday as the
 European Central Bank  temporarily halted lending to some Greek
banks and speculation mounted that Moody’s Investors Service
would downgrade Spanish lenders. The volume of shares changing
hands on the gauge was 29 higher today than the average of the
last 30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  European Stock Markets  National benchmark indexes retreated in 14 of the 17
western-European market that opened today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100
slid 1.3 percent, while Germany’s DAX slid 0.6 percent. France’s
CAC 40 slipped 0.1 percent. Sweden’s OMX dropped 3.1 percent.
The gauge reopened after a public holiday yesterday. Denmark was
closed for a public holiday today.  Almost $4 trillion has been wiped from  global equity
markets  in May amid mounting concern Greece will have to leave
the euro currency union. The country’s credit rating was reduced
one level by  Fitch Ratings  late yesterday amid concern it will
not muster the political support needed to remain a member of
the 17-nation euro area.  Moody’s lowered the debt ratings of 16 Spanish banks after
the close of U.S. trading yesterday, citing mounting loan
losses, the  country’s recession , restricted access to funds and
the reduced ability of the government to support lenders as its
own creditworthiness diminishes.  The rating company cut nine lenders by three notches,
including  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria
SA (BBVA) , and kept seven on review for further reductions. The move
follows Moody’s May 14 downgrade of 26 Italian banks and its
Feb. 13 cut of Spain’s sovereign-debt rating.  Santander, BBVA Rebound  Santander and BBVA climbed 3 percent to 4.58 euros and 3.7
percent to 4.94 euros, as both banks rebounded from a five-day
retreat.  Bankia SA (BKIA)  surged 23 percent to 1.76 euros for its first
gain in 11 days and the biggest rally on the Stoxx 600.  The country’s lenders have called for a ban on short
selling their shares, according to a report in Cinco Dias. The
newspaper cited unidentified sources at the banks.  A  gauge of European banks  decreased 1.1 percent today,
extending its 8.5 percent tumble over the previous five days.  Rio Tinto, the world’s third-biggest mining company,
retreated 2.4 percent to 2,788 pence.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  lost
2.7 percent to 958.5 pence and Xstrata Plc dropped 4.3 percent
to 914.7 pence.  A gauge of mining companies retreated after data showed
 house prices  fell in a record number of Chinese cities last
month and car dealers posted inventory levels that indicated
deeper price cuts.  Volkswagen, Daimler Drop  European carmakers posted the biggest decline of the 19
industries in the Stoxx 600. Volkswagen dropped 2 percent to
128.20 euros, Porsche SE slid 2.4 percent to 39.93 euros and
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  lost 2.3 percent to 61.31 euros.  A gauge of industrial goods companies contributed the most
to the  Stoxx 600’s decline  after Caterpillar, the world’s
largest maker of construction and mining equipment, reported
slowing growth in sales.  Caterpillar’s global machinery sales rose 12 percent in the
three months through April. That compared with an 18 percent
increase through March and a 21 percent advance through
February. The stock lost 4.4 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  sank 4.6 percent to 78.45 kronor,  Sandvik AB (SAND) , the
world’s biggest maker of metal-cutting tools, dropped 2.5
percent to 90.30 kronor and  Atlas Copco AB (ATCOA) , the world’s largest
maker of air compressors, slipped 3.2 percent to 140.60 kronor.  LSE (LSE)  jumped 2.9 percent to 992 pence after Europe’s oldest
independent bourse posted profit for the six months to the end
of March that surged to 405.9 million pounds ($641 million),
boosted by money earned from deposits at its Italian central
counterparty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
