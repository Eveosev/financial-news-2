Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  recalled 650,000 units of
Advil Liqui-Gels in March because of an odor caused by over-
processed gelatin.  The pills were recalled from stores by distributors in a
March 16 letter sent by New York-based Pfizer, according to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s  website . The gelatin is an
inactive ingredient in the medicine, and over processing made
the pills smell.  “It had a strong odor,” Jenifer Antonacci, a Pfizer
spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. “As soon as we
found out about it, we isolated the issue and corrected it.”  Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, isn’t the only one
to experience quality issues with consumer pain relief products.
On Feb. 17, Johnson & Johnson, based in  New Brunswick , New
Jersey, said it was pulling over a half-million bottles of
infants’ Tylenol from shelves.  Pfizer gained less than 1 percent to $22.57 at the close of
 New York  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
