Temperatures across the U.S. Midwest
will rise to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) this weekend,
then dip briefly until a new round of heat moves into the region
by the end of next week.  St. Louis  may see 90 in two days, while temperatures in
Chicago are expected to reach at least 89, according to the
 National Weather Service . The warmth will probably increase
electricity use by 60 percent or more throughout the region in
the coming week, said  David Salmon  of Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri.  Temperatures from the Great Plains to Quebec may be 8
degrees above normal from May 23 to May 27, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The weather service is predicting rain and temperatures in
the 60s and 70s from Philadelphia to Boston to start next week.
Highs may reach 86 in Montreal and Ottawa and 79 in Toronto this
weekend, according to  Environment Canada .  High temperatures create spikes in electricity demand as
people turn to air conditioners to cool homes and businesses.
The low price of natural gas has meant more power plants are
using the fuel to generate energy.  The largest draws on electricity occur when hot weather
descends on large cities.  The normal average temperature in  New York  on May 29 is
about 67 degrees, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. Itâ€™s 61 in Boston; 69 in Washington; 74
in Atlanta; 79 in Houston; 77 in Dallas; 58 in Seattle and 67 in
Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
