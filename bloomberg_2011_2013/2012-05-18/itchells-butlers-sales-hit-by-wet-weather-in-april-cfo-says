Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB) , the owner of
the All Bar One chain, saw a “pretty” severe decline in sales
in April as unseasonally wet weather kept consumers at home,
said Chief Financial Officer Tim Jones.  “Food and drink were both in negative territory in
April,” Jones said today on a conference call.  Sales growth for the 11 weeks to April 7 was 0.2 percent,
compared with a rise of 4.4 percent in the previous quarter,
according to a regulatory filing by the company today. M&B owns
1,600 sites in the U.K., including Toby Carvery and O’Neills
pubs.  The company is likely to get a boost in sales this year
from the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the 2012 Olympics
in  London  and the European Soccer championships, executive
chaiman Bob Ivell said on the same call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
