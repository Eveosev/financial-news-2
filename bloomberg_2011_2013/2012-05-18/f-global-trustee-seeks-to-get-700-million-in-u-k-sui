A trustee for brokerage MF Global
Inc. said  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  returned $168 million in cash and
that he’s still discussing his other claims with the bank.  The $168 million is the proceeds of excess collateral that
JPMorgan held at the beginning of the brokerage’s liquidation,
said the trustee, James Giddens, in a statement today. The bank
has kept an interest in the sum, so that if any of its allegedly
secured claims against MF Global become unsecured, it can make a
claim to recover the $168 million, Giddens said.  “The Trustee believes that this recovery will assist him
in his primary duty of recovering property for the benefit of
MFGI customers,” Giddens said in the statement.  Giddens, appointed under the Securities Investor Protection
Act to return funds to former customers of the failed brokerage,
has estimated a $1.6 billion shortfall to what they are owed.  While Giddens is overseeing distributions to customers at
MF Global Inc., its parent, MF Global Holdings Inc., once run by
former New Jersey Governor and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. co-
chairman Jon Corzine, filed for bankruptcy separately to
apportion returns to creditors, including bondholders and
lenders such as JPMorgan.  The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan). The parent’s bankruptcy case
is  MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) , 11-bk-15059,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court ,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
