Feedlots slashed purchases of young
cattle by 15 percent in April as the number available for sale
shrank and improved pasture conditions allowed animals to stay
on grazing areas.  Feedlots bought 1.521 million head of cattle last month,
down from 1.785 million in April 2011, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Thirteen analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News projected a 12 percent drop, on average. The
feedlot herd totaled 11.110 million as of May 1, down 0.6
percent from a year earlier. Analysts expected a 0.3 percent
gain.  Better pasture conditions and smaller supplies of animals
contributed to the drop in feedlot purchases, or placements,
last month, according to the Livestock Marketing Information
Center in Denver. The U.S. cattle herd was the smallest since
1952 as of Jan. 1 as a drought in the South scorched pastures,
spurring ranchers to cull herds and sell animals to feedlots
earlier than normal. Ranchers sold more cattle in February,
November, September, June and July than in the same months in
the previous year.  “Feedlot placements are falling off like a stone due to
poor feedlot profitability, but more importantly, because of a
lack of available cattle to put on feed,” Troy Vetterkind, the
owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in  Chicago , said in an e-
mail before the report. “This is bringing our total on-feed
population even with a year ago and is going to be pretty
supply-friendly for the third and fourth quarter of this year.”  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened on corn for about four to five months until they
weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  The average global  temperature  last month was the fifth
warmest ever for April, according to the  National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration . In the U.S., the average was 55
degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 degrees Celsius), which is the third
warmest for any  April , the agency said.  Feedlots sold about 1.815 million animals to meatpackers
last month, up 0.4 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected 1.7 percent decline, on average.  Fattened-cattle futures for August delivery rose 1.3
percent to $1.21625 a pound at 12:47 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the price fell 1.2 percent in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
