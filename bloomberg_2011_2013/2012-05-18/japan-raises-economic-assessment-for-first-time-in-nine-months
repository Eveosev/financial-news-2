Japan ’s government raised its
assessment of the economy even as the nation’s stocks headed for
the longest streak of weekly losses since 2001 on concern that
Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  “The Japanese economy is on the way to recovery at a
moderate pace, reflecting emerging demand for reconstruction,
while difficulties continue to prevail,” the  Cabinet Office 
said in the monthly report released in Tokyo today.  Stocks in Asia  slid today after U.S. economic data missed
estimates and a rating cut of Spanish banks fueled concern
Europe’s debt crisis is deepening. The government said downside
risks to Japan’s economy include sharp fluctuations in financial
markets and a slowdown in global growth amid uncertainties in
 Europe .  A government report yesterday showed  Japan’s economy  grew
more than expected in the first quarter as private consumption
rose and reconstruction spending from last year’s earthquake
boosted public investment. Economy Minister Motohisa Furukawa
said yesterday that the economy shows upward movement and
gradual growth may continue.  The Cabinet Office raised its evaluation of  consumer
spending , exports, corporate profits and employment in the May
report.  Looking ahead, the government said the economic recovery is
expected to become certain due to emerging demand from
reconstruction.  The government lowered its evaluation of  China’s economy 
for the first time in three months, saying that growth is
moderating in Japan’s largest trading partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
