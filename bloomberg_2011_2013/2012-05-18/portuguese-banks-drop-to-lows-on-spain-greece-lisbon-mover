Portuguese banks fell to record lows
in Lisbon trading on rising concerns that Greece may leave the
17-nation euro area and after Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded Spanish banks.  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) , Portugal’s biggest publicly traded
bank, fell as much as 6.4 percent to 45.1 euro cents, a 19-year
intraday low.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  and  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  lost
as much as 3 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively. Both lenders
are also trading at record lows.  “The selloff of Portuguese banks is linked to the
downgrade in Spain along with increasing fears Greece may leave
the euro area,” Pedro Oliveira, a trader at Oporto-based Go
Bulling, said by telephone.  Banco Santander SA and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Spain’s biggest lenders, were cut three levels by Moody’s
Investors Service yesterday, which cited a recession and
mounting loan losses in downgrading 16 of the nation’s banks.  The euro fell to a four-month low today after  Fitch Ratings 
downgraded Greece’s long-term credit rating, citing heightened
risk that the nation may not be able to sustain membership in
the monetary union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
