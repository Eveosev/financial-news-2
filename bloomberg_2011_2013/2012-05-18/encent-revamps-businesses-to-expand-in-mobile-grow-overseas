Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , China’s
biggest Internet company, is reorganizing its business units to
expand services for smartphone and social-networking users and
accelerate growth of its online games operations overseas.  Operations will be split into six businesses including
social networks and mobile Internet, the Shenzhen, China-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today. Tencent also plans
to set up an e-commerce subsidiary, it said.  Chief Executive Officer Pony Ma is diversifying Tencent
from a reliance on online games, which account for more than
half the revenue. Tencent faces competition from Chinese
Internet rivals including  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  and Alibaba Group Holding
Ltd. in winning users of smartphones such as Apple Inc.’s
iPhone. Also, the company aims to expand its social networking
sites as Facebook Inc.’s service is restricted in  China .  One of the aims of the business revamp is to “embrace the
expanding global online games market,” Ma said in the
statement.  Tencent will also form divisions for interactive
entertainment, online media, corporate development and
technology and engineering, it said.  Tencent rose 1.3 percent to HK$227.20 as of 11:04 a.m. in
Hong Kong trading. The stock has gained 46 percent this year,
the best performance in the city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Profit rose to a record 2.95 billion yuan ($466 million) in
the three months ended March 31, helped by rising online game
sales in China and South Korea, the company said in a May 16
Hong Kong stock exchange filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
