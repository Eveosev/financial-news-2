Solarworld AG (SWV)  climbed the most in
more than a year in Frankfurt trading after the U.S. sided with
 Germany ’s biggest solar-panel maker by imposing tariffs of as
much as 250 percent on Chinese rivals’ products.  Solarworld advanced as much as 18 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since March 15, 2011, after the U.S. Commerce
Department yesterday imposed preliminary antidumping duties of
31 percent to 250 percent on Chinese manufacturers after ruling
they sold products below cost. The decision followed complaints
from the industry including the U.S. unit of Solarworld.  The U.S. decision “is a first step so that we can return
to fair competition based on technology,” Chief Executive
Officer Frank Asbeck said today by phone. “It’s a signal for
 Europe , where we plan to file a similar complaint at mid-year.”  Solarworld gained 15 percent to 1.759 euros by 12:50 p.m.
in Germany, valuing it at 196.5 million euros ($250 million).  The U.S. ruling followed a complaint by companies that
argued Chinese peers including Suntech Power Holdings Co., the
world’s largest solar-panel maker, and Trina Solar Ltd. benefit
from state subsidies allowing them to sell products below cost.  The  import duties  on Chinese solar panels will raise their
price to $1.11 a watt, according to calculations by Bloomberg
New Energy Finance. That’s 17 percent higher than the current
spot price of non-Chinese panels, Jun Ying, a Beijing-based
analyst for the researcher, said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
