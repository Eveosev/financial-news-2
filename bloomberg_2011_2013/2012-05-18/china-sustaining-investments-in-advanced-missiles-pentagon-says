China  last year continued “sustained
investments” in advanced cruise and anti-ship missile
technologies that “appear designed” to blunt U.S. military
access to the region, according to the Pentagon’s latest annual
 report  on military developments in the Asian nation.  The Defense Department report released today includes “new
information on areas of the People’s Liberation Army
investments, including China’s aircraft carrier program, anti-
ship ballistic missiles, and aircraft development, as well as
discussion” of the country’s pursuit of the ability to launch
missions further from its shores, the Pentagon said in a press
release.  The report also said “authoritative writings and China’s
persistent cyber intrusions indicates the likelihood that
Beijing is using cyber network operations as a tool to collect
strategic intelligence.” The Pentagon released its 2010 version
of the annual report last August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
