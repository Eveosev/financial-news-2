The ruble depreciated against the
dollar for an 11th day, extending its losing streak to the
longest in more than three years as oil declined and after a
report showed weaker-than-expected Russian industrial growth.  The Russian currency lost 0.6 percent to 31.25 per dollar
by the close in Moscow, taking its weekly loss to 3.3 percent,
the steepest since September. The ruble declined 0.7 percent to
39.7475 per euro and 0.7 percent to 35.0739 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Urals crude sank 0.5 percent to $106.31 per barrel after
Greece was downgraded by  Fitch Ratings  and Moody’s Investors
Service cut 16 Spanish banks, stoking concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis will worsen. The European Union is Russia’s largest
trading partner.  “The conditions are ripe for the ruble to revisit 36
against the basket,”  Benoit Anne , head of emerging-market
strategy at Societe Generale SA in  London , said by e-mail. “ Oil
prices  are virtually in freefall along with risk indicators.”  Russian  industrial production  increased by 1.3 percent last
month from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Service in
Moscow said in an e-mailed statement yesterday, the weakest pace
since it started rising in November 2009. The median estimate of
15 economists in a Bloomberg survey showed expectations of 3.2
percent growth.  The output report “is clearly going to raise questions
about the growth story for the period ahead,” Anne said.  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.7621
per dollar in three months, compared with expectations of
31.5805 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
