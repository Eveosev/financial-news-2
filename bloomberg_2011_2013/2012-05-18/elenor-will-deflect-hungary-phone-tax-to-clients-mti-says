Telenor ASA (TEL) , the Nordic region’s
largest telephone company, said it will deflect a minute-based
phone tax in  Hungary  onto its customers,  MTI  reported, citing
Istvan Kutas, the local unit’s director of communications.  The minute-based tax on phone calls, which the government
plans to introduce from July 1, would bring to two the number of
extraordinary taxes telecommunication companies have to pay in
the second half, costing Telenor about 1 billion forint ($4.2
million) a month, Kutas told the state news service.  “We can’t swallow that, therefore as soon as the new
extraordinary tax becomes effective, we have to incorporate the
minute-based tax in our prices,” Kutas told MTI, adding that
this is a better solution than cutting jobs or halting projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
