BP Plc bought a cargo of Russian
Urals crude in northwest Europe at a 12-week high, the first
trade in more than one month.  North Sea  Forties failed to change
hands in the absence of bids and offers.  TNK-BP, the Russian oil producer half-owned by BP Plc,
issued a tender to sell 100,000 metric tons of Urals for loading
on May 26 to May 27 from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk, two
traders who participate in the market said.  North Sea  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the
session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 18 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent, the highest since April 12, compared with
a premium of 17 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed.  Total SA bought a shipment of Forties yesterday from
Trafigura Beheer BV for loading on June 7 to June 9 at 40 cents
a barrel more than Dated Brent, the highest traded price since
April 11, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts trading window.  Brent for July settlement traded at $107.18 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $108.46 yesterday. The August contract was at
$106.56, a discount of 62 cents to July.  Three cargoes of Alvheim blend for loading in the second
half of June and early July were deferred by one to four days, a
revised loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The cargo originally planned for June 17 to June 19 will be
deferred by two days, while the last shipment for next month
will be loaded on June 27 to June 29, four days later than
planned, according to the schedule.  The first shipment for July will be delayed by one day to
July 3 to July 5, the program showed.  Mediterranean/Urals  BP bought 100,000 tons of Urals for May 28 to June 1
loading from Gunvor Group Ltd. at $1.20 a barrel less than Dated
Brent, the highest price since Feb. 24, the survey showed. The
grade last traded at a discount of $3.75 on April 12.  No bids or offers were made for Urals in the Mediterranean.
The blend was at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent in the
region, the highest since Feb. 22, compared with a 32-cent
discount yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  TNK-BP sold two cargoes of the blend with a combined volume
of 240,000 tons to Vitol Group, two traders involved in the
regionâ€™s oil said.  Vitol bought one 100,000-ton shipment for June 1 to June 2
loading from Ust-Luga on the  Baltic Sea , and another 140,000
tons for June 4 to June 5 from the Black Sea port of
Novorossiysk, according to the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold 100,000 tons of Urals for June 3 to
June 4 from Ust-Luga to BP via a separate tender, they said.  West Africa  Bharat Petroleum Corp. issued a tender to buy crude for
loading from July 21 to July 31, according to a document
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The tender closes on May 28, with offers valid until the
following day, the document showed.  Qua Iboe was at a premium of $1.86 a barrel to Dated Brent,
down from a premium of $1.88 yesterday, Bloomberg data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
