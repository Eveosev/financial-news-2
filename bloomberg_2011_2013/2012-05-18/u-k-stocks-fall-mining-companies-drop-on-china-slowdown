U.K. stocks  fell for a fifth day, the
longest streak of losses since November, as commodities
producers slid amid signs of slowing growth in China.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Rio Tinto  Group, the biggest London-
listed mining companies, declined more than 1 percent. Banking
shares slid, with Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc retreating
5.1 percent.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) , Europe’s oldest
independent bourse, advanced 2.9 percent after fiscal second-
half profit quadrupled.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  dropped 70.76, or 1.3 percent,
to 5,267.62 at the close in London, extending this week’s
retreat to 5.5 percent. The gauge has  declined 12 percent from
its 2012 high  on March 16 amid growing concern Greece will
default on its debt, entering a so-called correction. The FTSE
All-Share Index fell 1.4 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index slipped 0.4 percent.  “Bulls will doubtless be glad to put this week behind
them, having had to endure a wave of selling that has its
origins in Europe,” Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG
Index in  London , wrote in an e-mail. “Monday morning will
probably find us in very much the same position in which we are
now.”  The FTSE 100 has tumbled 8.2 percent in May as almost $4
trillion has been wiped from global equity markets. Greece’s
credit rating was reduced one level by  Fitch Ratings  late
yesterday amid concern it will not muster the political support
needed to sustain its membership in the euro area.  Greek Government  Greece swore in a caretaker government led by Panagiotis Pikrammenos yesterday as the leaders of the two biggest parties
clashed over how the country could stay in the 17-nation euro
region.  Moody’s Investors Service lowered debt ratings at 16
Spanish banks, citing a surge in soured loans, the country’s
recession, restricted funding access and the reduced ability of
the government to support lenders as its own creditworthiness
diminishes.  BHP Billiton  fell 1.2 percent to 1,704.5 pence and Rio
Tinto retreated 2.4 percent to 2,788 pence. Commodity shares
dropped after data today showed China’s home prices fell in a
record number of cities last month and car dealers posted
inventory levels that foreshadowed deeper price cuts, adding to
signs of slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  slipped 2.7 percent to 958.5 pence
and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  lost 4.3 percent to 914.7 pence.  Banks Drop  Banking shares declined, with RBS retreating 5.1 percent to

refinance as much as 100 billion pounds ($158 billion) of loans
and the euro-region’s debt crisis is making banks less willing
to extend credit, according to a study by De Montfort
University.  About 72.5 billion pounds to 100 billion pounds “will
struggle to be refinanced on current market terms,” according
to a December survey of 63 lenders by the university, located
near Leicester, England. The borrowers will have insufficient
collateral to refinance maturing loans under current lending
terms, the study showed.  SIG Slips  SIG Plc (SHI) , a supplier of insulation and roofing, dropped 2.7
percent to 89.5 pence after the company reiterated that market
volume will be slightly down in 2012, adding that it sees uneven
demand patterns over the year.  John Menzies Plc (MNZS)  fell 5.3 percent to 584.5 pence after

half profit quadrupled. Net income for the six months ended
