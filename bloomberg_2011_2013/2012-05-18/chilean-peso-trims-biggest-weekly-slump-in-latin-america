Chile’s peso gained, trimming the
steepest weekly decline among Latin American currencies, after
copper rebounded and the central bank left the country’s
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 5 percent.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 503.66 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:58 a.m. Santiago time. The peso has declined 3.3 percent from
487 on May 11, amid a broad emerging-market selloff, the biggest
drop among regional currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Chile’s peso broke through 500 for the first time since
January as the price of the country’s main export copper
tumbled. Copper gained as much as 1.1 percent in  New York  today
after reaching a four-month low on May 16.  “It has been a bad week for the markets in general with
generalized stop losses in the Chilean market as we broke
through a range that had been held for two or three months,”
said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at EuroAmerica
Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “We can expect a technical
bounce after four days of heavy declines that may take the
 exchange rate  below 500 for a few days. It depends how markets
evolve today.”  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
increased their short position in the currency to $8.9 billion
on May 16, the biggest since October 2009 and a $1.1 billion
increase in a week.  Pension funds and other local investors placed a $1.8
billion bet on the Chilean peso in the forwards market in the
seven days through May 16. They had a $16.8 billion long peso
position, the highest since April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
