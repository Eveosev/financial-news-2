SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-
biggest brewer by volume, is investing $300 million in Peru to
meet surging beer demand in Latin America’s fastest-growing
economy, according to the London-based company’s local unit.  Union de Cervecerias Peruanas Backus y Johnston SAA (BACKUSI1) ,
acquired by SABMiller as part of a 2005 purchase of Bogota-based
Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, is upgrading its five Peruvian
brewhouses and replacing 600 distribution trucks with natural
gas-fueled vehicles to cut costs, Chief Executive Officer
Mauricio Leyva said in an interview yesterday from his Lima
office. The expansion should be completed next year, he said.  “Growth, consumption and the way our brands have been
absorbed have been spectacular,” Leyva said. “We’re seeing new
opportunities in new locations and disposable income.”  Peruvian beer consumption per capita has risen to 45 liters
(9.9 gallons) from 28 liters in 2006, Leyva said. The beer
market is set to grow another 10 percent this year, while  gross
domestic product  expands an estimated 6 percent, he said.  Peru ’s economy will grow 5 percent this year, outpacing
other major Latin American economies, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  SABMiller, the maker of Grolsch and Peroni, controls 93.4
percent of the local market, Leyva said. Backus competes with
Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, the world’s biggest brewer, and Peru’s
 Aje Group .  SABMiller’s London-traded shares fell 2.3 percent to
2,419.5 pence at the close of trading today. Backus  dropped  1.2
percent to 8.5 soles at 11:21 a.m. in Lima and gained 46 percent
so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
