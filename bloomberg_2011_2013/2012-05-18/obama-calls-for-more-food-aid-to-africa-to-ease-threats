President  Barack Obama  today called
for a new phase of African food aid focused on private-sector
development to ease threats to global security posed by scarce
nutrition.  Obama announced new investments in African agriculture in a
speech in  Washington  in conjunction with this weekend’s summit
of leaders from the Group of Eight nations. Reducing hunger
around the world is a “moral imperative” as well as a
necessary component for global security, he said.  Reducing hunger must be “at the forefront of global
development,” Obama said. The U.S. and other wealthy nations
must support “broad-based, inclusive growth that actually helps
nations lift people out of poverty.”  The initiative is aimed at boosting global  food production 
as rising wealth in Asia drives consumption and the planet adds
2 billion people by 2050.  To contact the reporter on this story:
