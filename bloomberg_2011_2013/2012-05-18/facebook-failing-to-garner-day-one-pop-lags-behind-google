Facebook Inc.’s (FB)  stock market debut
was anything but celebratory.  The 8-year-old social-networking site run by co-founder
 Mark Zuckerberg  closed 0.6 percent higher at $38.23 in  New York 
yesterday. That compares with  Carlyle Group LP (CG) ’s lackluster 0.2
percent day-one increase on May 3. It pales in contrast with
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s 18 percent jump in its 2004 initial public
offering,  Visa Inc. (V) ’s 28 percent gain in 2008 and LinkedIn
Corp.’s 109 percent surge last May.  Facebook raised $16 billion in the largest IPO on record
for a technology company. The offering valued Facebook at $104
billion, making it the seventh-biggest U.S. technology company
by stock market valuation. Yet by sales Facebook doesn’t crack
the top 50, leaving some investors concerned about the stock’s
ability to increase from here.  “I’m a skeptic when it comes to Facebook,” said  Eric Jackson , founder of Ironfire Capital LLC. “IPOs in general are
extremely volatile and it’s very difficult to handicap.”  Initial trading in the stock yesterday took a half-hour
longer than Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s forecast. About 40 minutes
later, the second-largest U.S. equities exchange operator said
it was investigating an issue in reporting trades from the
opening auction back to the brokerages that made them. Nasdaq
later said it delivered the messages.  SEC Review  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will review the
incident,  John Nester , an SEC spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  Facebook was the 11th U.S. consumer Internet company to go
public in the past year, a stretch that began with LinkedIn a
year ago. With a valuation of $104.8 billion at yesterday’s
close, Facebook is worth more than three times the other 10
combined. LinkedIn is second, valued at $10.3 billion.  While on a percentage basis, Facebook’s first-day gain was
less dramatic than most, it added close to $1 billion in value
because of its size. For every dollar that Facebook’s stock
gains, the company’s value rises by $2.74 billion.  “The scale of this thing is monstrous,” said  Francis Gaskins , president of researcher IPOdesktop.com in Marina Del
Rey, California. “Nothing like this has ever happened before
and it’s never going to happen again. You just can’t compare
it.”  Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, is already
bigger by value than companies including Cisco Systems Inc. and
 Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)   Here’s a snapshot of how other landmark IPOs performed in
their debuts (in alphabetical order):  Carlyle Group LP began trading on May 3 at $22 and rose 0.2
percent to $22.05, after earlier advancing as much as 2.1
percent to $22.45. The IPO valued the second-largest private-
equity firm at $6.7 billion.  General Motors Co. (GM)  emerged from bankruptcy and went public
in November 2010, raising more than $20 billion. The Detroit-
based automaker climbed as much as 9.1 percent in its first day
of trading on Nov. 18, only to close up 3.6 percent $34.19.  Google Inc., the world’s biggest search engine, jumped 18
percent to $100.34 in its debut on Aug. 19, 2004. The Mountain
View, California-based company finished the day with a $27.2
billion valuation. It’s since multiplied more than sevenfold to
$195.6 billion.  Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , the biggest daily-deal coupon site, began
trading on Nov. 4 at $20 and surged 31 percent to $26.11 in its
first day, after earlier advancing 56 percent to $31.14.
Groupon, based in Chicago, was valued at $12.7 billion in the
IPO and has since tumbled 42 percent to $7.5 billion.  LinkedIn Corp. began trading on May 19, 2011, and more than
doubled to $94.25 from $45, adding $4.66 billion in market
value. The professional-networking site has since climbed
another 5 percent.  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  raised $5.47 billion in its IPO
on Nov. 9, 1999. UPS began trading at $50 the following day and
rose 37 percent to close at $68.25. It surged as much as 41
percent to $70.31 in intraday trading. More than 12 years later,
the stock trades at $74.03, giving the Atlanta-based company a
$71 billion valuation.  Visa Inc., world’s largest electronic-payments network,
debuted on March 19, 2008. It jumped 28 percent to close at
$56.50, after gaining as much as 57 percent. The San Francisco-
based company has more than doubled since the IPO and is worth
$75.7 billion.  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , the maker of Facebook games including
“FarmVille” and “CityVille,” dropped 5 percent to close at
$9.50 on Dec. 16, its first trading day, after gaining as much
as 15 percent. The IPO valued the San Francisco-based company at
about $7 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
