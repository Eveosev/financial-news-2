Anadolu Cam Sanayii AS (ANACM) , a Turkish
glassmaker, fell the most this year after saying first-quarter
profit declined, missing estimates.  Anadolu Cam lost 3.1 percent to 2.79 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the biggest drop since Dec. 28 to the lowest level
since Jan. 25.  The companyâ€™s net income declined to 10.5 million liras
($5.7 million) in the first quarter from 31.9 million liras in
the same period of 2011, it said in a statement to the  Istanbul
Stock Exchange  after the market closed yesterday. Anadolu Cam
was expected to earn 15.5 million liras, according to the
average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
