Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, more than doubled
in the latest week as wheat shipments to  Algeria  jumped.  Export cargoes climbed to 128,998 metric tons between May
10 and May 16 from 59,852 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River
port  wrote in an e-mailed report today. That included 123,401
tons of soft wheat, compared with 55,452 tons the previous week.  Algeria was the biggest destination, taking 75,684 tons of
soft wheat, up from 25,502 tons the previous week.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the  North Sea , which shipped out 17 percent and 11
