European stock futures dropped,
signaling the Stoxx Europe 600 Index will extend its longest
losing streak in two months, after Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded Spanish banks. U.S. futures and Asian shares fell.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
may lead a selloff by European lenders after Moody’s downgraded
Spain’s biggest banks three levels.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  may be
active amid signs of slowing growth in China.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in June slid
1.3 percent to 2,099 at 7:05 a.m. in London. Futures on FTSE 100
Index futures expiring the same month sank 1.3 percent, while
contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent
after the gauge slumped to a four-month low yesterday. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index plunged 2.9 percent today.  “Asian stocks nosedived this morning over the European
debt crisis,” said Nam Truong, a trader at Capital Spreads in
 London . “Contagion fears have gripped the markets with a storm
closely brewing over Europe.”  The benchmark Stoxx 600 retreated for a fourth day
yesterday, extending its selloff so far this week to 4.1
percent, as the European Central Bank temporarily halted lending
to some Greek banks and speculation mounted that Moody’s would
downgrade Spanish lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
