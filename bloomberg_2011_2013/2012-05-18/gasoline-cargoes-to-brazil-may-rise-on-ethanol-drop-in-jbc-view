Gasoline shipments to  Brazil  from the
U.S. and  Europe  may rise as slumping ethanol production
encourages consumption of the auto fuel, JBC Energy GmbH said.  Brazilian ethanol production fell more than 40 percent from
a year earlier in April, the Vienna-based consultant said in a
report today, citing data from the Brazilian Sugarcane Industry
Association, or Unica. Output of hydrous ethanol, sold at pumps
in Brazilian filling stations, slid 18 percent, JBC said.  Brazil, the world’s biggest sugar producer, uses its sugar-
cane crop to make ethanol as well as the sweetener. Shrinking
ethanol supplies in the country will mean lower use of the
biofuel for transportation this year, spurring demand for
gasoline, JBC said.  “The implication is that further gasoline exports from the
U.S. and Europe to  Latin America  will result,” BNP Paribas SA
energy strategist Gareth Lewis-Davies said by phone today.  The share of the cane harvest from Brazil’s main growing
region devoted to making sugar will reach a six-year high of
48.8 percent in the current crop year begun April 1, Antonio de
Padua Rodrigues, Unica’s technical director, said last month.  About 46 percent of the country’s cars were so-called flex-
fuel vehicles that can burn either gasoline or ethanol as of
last year, according to Sucden Geneva SA analyst Claudiu Covrig.
The figure excludes trucks and buses, Covrig said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
