Most Indian stocks declined, with the
benchmark index heading for its fourth weekly loss, as U.S.
economic data and a worsening European debt crisis prompted
investors to sell emerging-market assets.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the Indian owner of Jaguar Land Rover,
tumbled to a three-month low.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the
country’s biggest power-equipment producer, plunged to a five-
year low.  State Bank of India , the biggest lender, surged the
most in a week after reporting a record four-quarter  profit. (SBIN)   The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, lost less than
0.1 percent to 16,058.46 at 2:10 p.m. in Mumbai, erasing an
intraday fall of 1.6 percent. Three shares declined for every
two that advanced. Almost $4 trillion has been wiped from global
equity markets so far this month as Greece’s failure to form a
government rekindled Europe’s debt crisis and signs of slowing
economic growth in  China  and U.S. damped the outlook for world
demand. Europe is  India ’s largest trading partner.  “Investor sentiment seems to be universally bearish,”
Neelkanth Mishra, head of Indian equity strategy at Credit
Suisse Group AG, told Bloomberg UTV today. “Usually that would
mean the markets don’t have more downside. But given investors’
perception of the risks existing in Europe, fears of a slowdown
in China and the macro issues in India, I don’t think markets
are cheap enough.” A Sensex of 13,500 to 14,000 would be a
“reasonable level” to start buying, he said.  U.S. economic reports yesterday showed jobless claims in
the nation were unchanged at 370,000 in the week ended May 12.
The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index fell in the week ended May
13 to minus 43.6, a level associated with recessions or their
aftermaths, from minus 40.4 in the previous period. In Europe,
Moody’s Investors Service cut debt ratings at 16 Spanish banks,
citing a recession and mounting loan losses.  Greece ’s rating was
reduced one level by  Fitch Ratings .  ‘Risk Off’  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 2.6 percent to 112.50, its
biggest drop since November. The index entered a co-called
correction yesterday after falling more than 10 percent from a
Feb. 29 high. The Sensex has fallen 13 percent from its Feb. 21
high and is  valued  at 12.5 times estimated earnings, the lowest
in more than three years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
 compares with  a multiple of 9.7 times for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index. The Indian rupee hit a record low today.  “Risk has been taken off the table,” Andrew Holland,
chief executive officer of investment advisory at Ambit Capital
Pvt. in Mumbai, said in an interview to Bloomberg UTV today.
“It’s not just India; the rest of Asia is down considerably.”  ‘Ferocious Headwinds’  Concern India’s outlook has worsened because of trade and
fiscal deficits, policy gridlock, elevated  consumer prices  and
slowing global growth has made the rupee Asia’s worst performer
this quarter. The Dollar Index rose 1.7 percent this week, the
most since December.  “Strong market forces in favor of the dollar have created
panic,” said J. Moses Harding, executive vice president at
IndusInd Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “The  Reserve Bank  of India does
not have enough ammunition to fight against the tsunami-like
ferocious headwinds the rupee is facing.”  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index, added 1.9 percent to 24.03,
the highest level since March 29. The Nifty gained 0.1 percent
to 4,873.75. Both the Sensex and Nifty indexes are poised for a
fourth straight weekly loss of at least 1.1 percent each. The
 BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,984.07.  A total of 750 million shares traded on the BSE and NSE
yesterday, 17 percent less than the 12-month daily average.  Biggest Gainer  Tata Motors sank 4.9 percent to 257.85 rupees. Today’s drop
pared this year’s rally to 44 percent, still the biggest gainer
on the Sensex this year.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  tumbled 4.1
percent to 1,156.3 rupees.  Bharat Heavy lost 3.8 percent to 198.35 rupees, its lowest
level since March 2007.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the second-largest
software exporter that gets 21 percent of its sales from Europe,
fell 1.5 percent to 2,335.6 rupees.  State Bank  rallied 3.9 percent to 1,919.8 rupees. Profit
climbed to 40.5 billion rupees ($738 million) for the quarter
ended March, compared with the 35.3 billion rupee median of 41
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The stock rose as the bank’s
 risk buffers  widened following a 79 billion rupee infusion of
capital by the government, while the bad-debt ratio narrowed
from December levels.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the country’s second-biggest lender, rose
1.8 percent to 801.9 rupees, erasing an earlier fall of as much
as 2.6 percent.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s
largest refining complex, gained 1 percent to 691.85 rupees.  Foreign  funds  sold a net  $88.7 million  of local stocks on
May 16, paring their investment this year to $8.7 billion,
according to the nation’s market regulator. Overseas  funds  sold
a net $102.6 million of shares in April, deterred by proposed
changes in tax rules, after remaining net buyers in each of the
first three months of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
