Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index erasing this year’s gains, after U.S. economic
data missed estimates and ratings agencies downgraded Spanish
banks and Greece as Europe’s debt crisis deepens.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , a consumer-electronics maker that
gets 40 percent of sales from Europe and America, dropped 4.7
percent in Seoul as exporters tumbled. Japanese machinery makers
plunged in  Tokyo  after sales growth slowed at industry
bellwether Caterpillar Inc. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies fell as much as 21
percent from its high for the year on Feb. 29 after  home prices 
slid in a record number of mainland cities during April.  “We don’t know what will happen with Greece, and when
something does happen, we don’t know what impact that will
have,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of about $23.8
billion. “We don’t even know what the worst-case scenario is.
All people can do is escape from risks, a so-called panic.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slid 2.5 percent to 112.58 as
of 8:12 p.m. in Tokyo, its biggest drop since Nov. 10, with more
than eight stocks retreating for each that rose. The index,
which entered a co-called correction yesterday after falling
more than 10 percent from a Feb. 29 high, is headed for a 5.1
percent retreat for the week, its steepest  weekly  drop since
September.  Almost $4 trillion has been wiped from global equity
markets this month as Greece’s failure to form a government
rekindled Europe’s debt crisis and signs of slowing economic
growth in China and U.S. damped the outlook for global demand.  Topix Weekly Decline  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average retreated 3 percent today.
The broader Topix Index dropped 2.9 percent, capping the longest
streak of weekly losses since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 2.7 percent, its lowest
closing level this year, while South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped
3.4 percent.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  declined 1.3 percent, while
China’s Shanghai Composite Index retreated 1.4 percent. Home
prices fell in a record 46 of 70 cities tracked by China’s
statistics bureau in April from a year earlier as officials
pledged to keep restrictions on property purchases.  The U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 3.8 percent
this year, while the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  declined 1.2
percent. Stocks in the  Asian benchmark  were valued at 11.8 times
estimated earnings on average yesterday, compared with a
multiple of 12.4 for the  S&P 500  and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  Futures on the S&P 500 swung between gains and losses
today. The index dropped 1.5 percent in  New York  yesterday, a
fifth day of declines to a four-month low.  Sentiment Slumps  U.S. economic reports yesterday showed jobless claims in
the nation were unchanged at 370,000 in the week ended May 12.
That compares with the median forecast of 48 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News for a drop in claims to 365,000. The Bloomberg
Consumer Comfort Index fell in the week ended May 13 to minus
43.6, a level associated with recessions or their aftermaths,
from minus 40.4 in the previous period.  Samsung Electronics retreated 4.7 percent to 1,166,000 won
in Seoul, while  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , an Australian
supplier of building materials that gets more than half of its
sales from the U.S., slumped 2.6 percent to A$7.05 in Sydney.  Heavy-equipment maker Hitachi Construction Machinery Co.
tumbled 9.6 percent to 1,487 yen in Tokyo, the second-steepest
drop in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a maker of
excavators, fell 5.7 percent to 1,879 yen.  U.S.-based Caterpillar, the largest maker of construction
and mining equipment, said global machinery retail sales rose 12
percent in the three months through April from a year earlier,
the slowest rate since May 2010.  Credit Downgrades  Banco Santander SA was among 16 Spanish banks whose credit
ratings were cut by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited
economic weakness and the government’s mounting budget strain.  Greece’s credit rating was downgraded one level by  Fitch
Ratings  on concerns the country won’t be able to muster the
political support needed to sustain its membership in the euro
area.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (300) , a clothier that depends on Europe for
most of its sales, sank 4.1 percent to HK$12.56 in Hong Kong,
while Nippon Sheet Glass Co., a glassmaker that counts Europe as
its No. 1 market, slumped 4.3 percent to 89 yen in Tokyo.  Anta Sports Products Ltd. (2020) , a Chinese sportswear maker,
tumbled 9.2 percent to HK$6 in Hong Kong, the third- steepest
drop  in the Asia-Pacific Index, after Hitachi Construction and
Chinese luxury-vehicle seller China ZhengTong Auto Services
Holdings Ltd., which tumbled 12 percent. Intensifying
competition has been affecting the Anta’s profitability over the
past several quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
