Thailand’s baht was  set (SET)  for its
largest weekly slide since December as  Europe ’s debt crisis dims
the outlook for exports and prompts investors to favor safer
bets than emerging-market assets.  Government bonds  gained.  Global funds sold $212 million more of the nation’s debt
than they bought this week through yesterday, according to data
from the Thai Bond Market Association. Bank of Thailand Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul said on May 16 investors are shifting
funds to low-risk assets because of Europe’s debt problem. The
benchmark SET Index of stocks fell 1.5 percent in the first four
days of the week.  “Investors are pulling money out of  Asia  amid risk-off
sentiment,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian
and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo .
“Weakening external demand is a negative factor as Thailand’s
economy depends on exports, while a decline in stocks is also a
concern.”  The baht slumped 0.9 percent this week and 0.1 percent
today to 31.46 per dollar as of 8:36 a.m. in Bangkok, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 31.57 on May
16, the weakest level since January.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange
swings used to price options, was unchanged today and from a
week ago at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent debt due June
2017 declined 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 3.53
percent this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rate slid three basis points today.  Thailand ’s economy shrank 0.9 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier after contracting 9 percent in the previous
three months, according to the median forecast of economists in
a Bloomberg survey before a May 21 report. Exports, which are
equivalent to about two-thirds of gross domestic product,
climbed 6.5 percent in April after decreasing 6.5 percent in
March, a separate poll showed before data next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
