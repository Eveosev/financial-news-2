Hedge funds  and other large
speculators  boosted  wagers to a record that the euro will weaken
against the dollar amid speculation  Greece  may exit the shared
currency.  Bearish bets, so-called net shorts,  totaled  173,869 in the
week ended May 15, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. That was up from 143,984 a week earlier and compares
with a previous record of 171,347 reached on Jan. 27.  The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.2792 at 4:05 p.m. in New
York, paring its weekly loss against the dollar to 1 percent. It
touched $1.2722 on May 15, the lowest since Jan. 17.  Each Friday the CFTC publishes aggregate numbers for long
and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors that buy or sell futures. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculatorsâ€™ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
