Vietnam ’s five-year bonds had the
best week since June 2009 on speculation a decline in money-
market rates bolstered demand for government debt. The dong was
little changed.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  declined 43 basis
points this week to 1.92 percent, the lowest level since June
2009 when Bloomberg started compiling the data. The measure was
at 11.8 percent at the end of 2011.  “Interbank rates have dropped sharply, signaling banks
have surplus cash to invest in government notes,” said Tran Thi
Ngoc Thanh, deputy manager of the investment-banking division at
Sacombank Securities Joint-Stock Co. in  Ho Chi Minh City .
“Demand for bonds has increased, but supply has dropped.”  The  yield  on five-year bonds fell 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 9.5 percent this week, the lowest level
since June 2009, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. It was unchanged today.  The dong traded at 20,850 per dollar as of 3:05 p.m. in
Hanoi, after closing yesterday at 20,848, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the currency’s
reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the official fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
