Union Pacific Corp. (UNP) , the largest U.S.
rail carrier, said that U.S. economic growth is “slow and
steady.”  “Our view is that the economy is strengthening, that
things are getting better,” Eric Butler, the company’s
executive vice president of marketing and sales said in a
presentation at an American Copper Council meeting in Phoenix.
“Most of the signs we’re seeing across our business lines are
for slow and steady growth in the economy. Concerns about a
double-dip recession have eased.”  Still, the outlook could change “rapidly,” given concerns
that Europe’s debt crisis is worsening, Butler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
