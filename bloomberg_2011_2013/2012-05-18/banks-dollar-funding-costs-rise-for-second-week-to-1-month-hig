The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars rose for the second week to the highest in a month,
according to a money market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 51 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, at 9
a.m. in London, from minus 49 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The one-year basis swap was 71 basis points below Euribor
from minus 66 yesterday, the highest cost since Jan. 18. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Predictions in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to overnight indexed swaps, known as the FRA/OIS
spread, was little changed at 39 basis points. An increase
signals banks are more reluctant to lend.  The  Euribor-OIS spread  held at 38 basis points, the lowest
since Aug. 1, for the 11th day.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 762 billion euros ($965
billion) with the bank from 785 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
