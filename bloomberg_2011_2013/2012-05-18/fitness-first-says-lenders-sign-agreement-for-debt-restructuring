Fitness First Ltd., the gym operator
with 1.2 million club members in 15 countries, said more than 90
percent of its lenders signed a lock-up agreement, approving the
terms of the debt restructuring.  Lenders will write off all of their debt for an equity
stake in the Poole, England-based company and will provide a
long-term working capital credit facility, Fitness First said in
a statement. It expects the restructuring to be completed by the
end of September.  “The combination of having no debts and a committed
working capital facility will bring long-term financial security
to the company and provide a platform to grow and develop the
business,” Fitness First said in the statement.  Lenders led by Oaktree Capital Management LP and Marathon
Asset Management LP will get a more than 75 percent stake in
Fitness First, people with knowledge of the matter said on May
4. The two firms will also provide 100 million pounds ($158
million) of credit lines, the people said.  BC Partners Ltd., which bought Fitness First in 2005 for
1.2 billion euros, tried and failed last year to sell its stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
