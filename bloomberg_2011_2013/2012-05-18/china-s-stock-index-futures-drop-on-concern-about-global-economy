China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to a one-month low, as property prices slumped
in a record number of cities, fueling concern of a deepening
economic slowdown.  China  Vanke Co. and  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , the
nation’s biggest developers by market values, sank 1.2 percent
after  home prices  dropped in 46 of 70 cities in April. Jiangxi
Copper Co. slid 1.2 percent on speculation slower economic
growth will curb demand for metals.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)  dropped 1.9
percent as an industry association signaled that automobile
dealers are struggling with a rising number of unsold cars
that’s threatening to deepen price cuts.  “The slowdown in economic growth is more severe than we
expected,” Dai Ming, a  fund manager  at  Shanghai  Kingsun
Investment Management & Consulting Co. said by phone today.
“The risk of a hard landing still exists unless the government
steps up monetary or fiscal measures to bolster growth.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 1.4 percent to 2,344.52
at the close. The gauge settled at its lowest level since April
17 after slumping 4.4 percent in the past two weeks. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  lost 1.5 percent to 2,573.98. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, retreated 2.5 percent in  New York  yesterday.  The Shanghai index has dropped 4.7 percent from this year’s
high set on March 2 amid concern slowing economic growth will
hurt corporate profits. The MSCI BRIC Index of shares in Brazil,
Russia, China and India retreated 21 percent from this year’s
peak on March 2 through yesterday, a threshold analysts say
marks a  bear market , on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis and slower
U.S. economic growth will curb exports.  Property Prices  A gauge of property stocks in the Shanghai Composite fell
1.7 percent. Vanke fell 1.2 percent to 8.58  yuan . Poly Real
Estate, lost 1.2 percent to 12.73 yuan.  Financial Street Holding
Co. (000402)  retreated 1.5 percent to 6.60 yuan.  The eastern city of Wenzhou led declines in home prices
with a 12.3 percent slump in values from a year earlier, while
prices in Beijing dropped 1 percent and Shanghai declined 1.3
percent, according to data released by the statistics bureau.  The Housing Ministry said yesterday China will steadfastly
continue curbs on the housing market and won’t flip-flop on its
policies, the Shanghai Securities Journal reported. This
followed a pledge by the State Council, or Cabinet, last month
to stick with existing property controls implemented over the
past two years, where the government tightened down payments and
mortgages, and imposed restrictions on the number of homes
families can buy.  U.S. Data  Today’s decline has trimmed the advance in the Shanghai
index to 6.6 percent this year. Stocks in the measure are valued
at 10.1 times estimated earnings, compared with a record low of
8.9 times on Jan. 6, according to weekly  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Thirty-day  volatility  was at 15.12 today, near a two-
month low. About 8.8 billion shares in Shanghai traded
yesterday, 3 percent lower than the daily average this year.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, fell
1.2 percent to 25.12 yuan. Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co.,
the second largest, lost 2.7 percent to 20.70 yuan.  Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd. , the listed unit of nation’s biggest maker
of the lightweight metal, slipped 0.4 percent to 6.81 yuan.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slumped 2.6 percent today,
extending a global rout. The Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia said yesterday its general economic index decreased
to minus 5.8 in May, indicating an unexpected contraction in
manufacturing. The index of leading economic indicators dropped
in April for the first time in seven months.  Europe Crisis  Fitch Ratings  downgraded Greece’s credit rating by one
level yesterday, citing concerns the country won’t be able to
muster the political support needed to sustain its membership in
the euro area. Moody’s Investors Service also cut the credit
ratings of 16 Spanish banks yesterday.  Europe and the U.S. are China’s biggest export markets,
making up about 35 percent of the nation’s overseas shipments,
according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  “Europe and the U.S. will dominate sentiment in the short
term,” Shanghai Kingsun’s Dai said. “Investors need to avoid
risks.”  China’s  economic growth  may slow to 7.5 percent in the
second quarter, matching the government growth target for this
year, the China Securities Journal reported today, citing a
report from the State Information Center’s economic forecasting
department. Growth was 8.1 percent in the first three months,
the slowest pace in almost three years.  Auto Inventories  SAIC Motor, China’s largest carmaker, lost 1.9 percent to
15.18 yuan. FAW Car Co., which makes passenger cars in China
with Volkswagen AG, dropped 1.4 percent to 11.68 yuan.  BYD Co. (002594) ,
the automaker part-owned by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., slid 3.7 percent to 24.20 yuan.  Dealerships for Honda Motor Co., Chery Automobile Co., BYD
and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. carried more than 45 days of
inventory as of the end of April, exceeding the threshold that
foreshadows debilitating price cuts, Su Hui, vice president of
the auto market division at the state-backed China Automobile
Dealers Association, said in an interview yesterday.  Solar-related stocks fell after the U.S. imposed tariffs of
31 percent to 250 percent on imports of Chinese solar products,
adding to duties imposed earlier of as much as 4.73 percent as a
result of Chinese government subsidies, the Commerce Department
said yesterday.  BRICs Falter  EGing Photovoltaic Technology Co. (600537)  slumped 4.9 percent to
15.09 yuan, its lowest close since October 2009. Beijing
Jingyuntong Technology Co., a manufacturer of solar equipment,
tumbled 3.6 percent to 19.71 yuan.  The  MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC) ’s slide into a bear market has left
equities in the biggest emerging economies trading at the lowest
levels since 2009 versus global shares.  That’s still not cheap enough for Charles de Vaulx to add a
single stock to his $9.7 billion IVA Worldwide Fund, which beat
MSCI’s global gauge by 29 percentage points since its inception
in 2008. He’s waiting for further declines of 10 percent to 20
percent before buying.  “For the time being, we have nothing in the BRICs,” de
Vaulx said in a May 16 phone interview. “We’re starting to do
some work, but we haven’t been willing to pull the trigger.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell for a record 12th day.
The ETF dropped 2.2 percent to $33.19 yesterday, the lowest
since Oct. 20. Stocks in the China-U.S. gauge are valued at 17
times estimated earnings, the lowest since April 2009, according
to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Darren Boey, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
