Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB) , the owner of
the All Bar One chain, has two “strong” candidates for the
role of chief executive officer, Bob Ivell, the company’s
executive chairman, said in a conference call today.  “I have a shortlist of two,” Ivell said. “We’ve made
good progress.” He added that he doesn’t think the company has
suffered from the absence of a CEO since last year.  Mitchells & Butlers has been seeking a permanent CEO since
Adam Fowle stepped down in March 2011. Jeremy Blood took over as
interim CEO, then resigned last October. Ivell was appointed
executive chairman that month.  He said the progress the company has made to date is a
“credit” to its management. While no deadline has been set for
appointing a CEO, the vacancy for the post is “clearly, always
a concern,” he said.  Mitchells & Butlers shares fell as much as 1.7 percent, or
4.2 pence, in  London  today after the company said in a
Regulatory News Service statement that first-half pretax profit
declined 2.3 percent to 42 million pounds. Cost pressures will
ease in the second half, it said.  Simon Emeny, the managing director of  Fuller Smith & Turner (FSTA) 
Plc, and Mike Tye, the chief executive officer of Spirit Pub
Co., both rejected informal approaches by Mitchells & Butlers
about the CEO’s job, the Financial Times reported in February,
citing people familiar with the situation. The newspaper also
reported that Steve Richards, Novus Leisure Ltd.’s CEO, rejected
an approach.  Mitchells & Butlers denied it had approached either Emeny
or Tye, the Financial Times added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
