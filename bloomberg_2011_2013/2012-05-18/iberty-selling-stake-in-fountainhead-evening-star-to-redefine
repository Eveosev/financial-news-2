Liberty Holdings Ltd. (LBH) , the insurer
controlled by  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , agreed to sell its 50
percent stake in a real-estate administration business to
 Redefine Properties Ltd. (RDF)  for 330 million rand ($39 million).  The book value of the stake in Fountainhead Property Trust
Management Ltd. and Evening Star Trading 768 (Pty) Ltd. is about
203 million rand, the Johannesburg-based insurer said in a
statement today. Liberty bought the 50 percent holding for 186
million rand in March 2008.  First-quarter sales rose and assets under management
increased, Liberty said in the same statement, with single
premium new business increasing 36 percent to 3.27 billion rand.
Assets under management at Stanlib, Liberty’s money management
unit, climbed more than 3 percent while the company’s total
assets under management climbed to 469 billion rand from 455
billion rand at the end of December.  Liberty began in 2011 to widen its range of products and
train more financial advisers to boost sales, particularly to
individual consumers. Liberty, along with parent company
Standard Bank, has also been targeting African expansion as
growth in its domestic market slows. The insurer bought control
of Kenya’s  CFC Insurance Holding Ltd. (CFCI)  last year to give it a
foothold in  East Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
