Ethanol futures rose a fourth day in
 Chicago , capping their best week since December, on signs of
both higher demand and more expensive production costs.  Futures increased as warm, dry weather in the corn-rich
U.S. Midwest threatens to slow crop development, raising the
price for the ethanol feedstock, and after a May 16 Energy
Department report showed  production of conventional gasoline
blended with the biofuel  climbed to a record 5.4 million barrels
a day last week.  “It was a strong day,” said Matt Janney, a trader at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. “There’s a little
more gasoline demand. Corn was pretty strong.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery gained 3.6 cents, or
1.7 percent, to settle at $2.217 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest price since April 30. Futures advanced a
fourth day, the longest such streak since Feb. 28 and capped the
best week since Dec. 23. Ethanol has fallen 16 percent in the
past year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 5.5
cents, or 2.5 percent, to $2.24 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive increased 3.5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.175,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast gained 3 cents, or 1.3 percent,
to $2.355 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel jumped 3.5 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $2.235.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 1.7 percent to close at
$6.355 a bushel in Chicago.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 1.13 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to settle at $2.8895 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices lost 3.7 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
