The National Union of Mineworkers
asked its members at  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) ’s Rustenburg
operations in South Africa to “defend themselves” after a
worker was shot yesterday morning during conflict between two
rival unions.  “We strongly condemn the attitude of police and
management,”  Lesiba Seshoka , spokesman for the National Union
of Mineworkers, said by mobile phone. “We’re of the view that
it should have been prevented. We appealed to Impala to increase
security.” The situation is calm today, he said.  There has been increased police presence in the area since
January after violence erupted during a strike, Johan Theron, a
group executive for personnel at the world’s second-biggest
platinum producer, said by phone yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
