The  yuan  had the biggest weekly drop
since January on concerns over a default by  Greece  and a
slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.  New home prices in China declined from a year ago in 46 out
of 70 cities last month, the statistics bureau data showed
today. The People’s Bank of China cut  lenders’ reserve
requirements  by 50 basis points, effective today. Greece’s
credit rating was downgraded one level by  Fitch Ratings 
yesterday on concern the country may fail to get the political
support needed to sustain its euro membership.  “Risk appetite is worsening as people are worried Greece
will leave the euro-zone,” said Stella Lee, president of
Success Futures & Foreign Exchange Ltd. in Hong Kong. “ China ’s
reserve-ratio cut was taken negatively by investors as a sign
that the economy is slowing quicker than expected.”  The yuan dropped 0.28 percent this week to close at 6.3284
per dollar in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. That is the worst week since Jan. 20.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.21 percent
to 6.3260 per dollar this week. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards declined 0.47 percent in five days to 6.3900, the
biggest weekly decline since March 16, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts traded at a 0.96 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate.  The central bank set the  reference rate  0.04 percent
stronger at 6.3209 today, strengthening it for the first time in
eight days. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the daily fixing. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, climbed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
2.2 percent.  China’s gross domestic product may expand 7.5 percent in
the second quarter, from 8.1 percent in the previous three
months, China Securities Journal said today, citing a report
from the State Information Center. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut
its forecast for China’s growth this quarter to 7.9 percent,
from 8.5 percent, in note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
