Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) , a maker of
architectural and engineering software, fell the most in more
than three years after providing a second-quarter earnings
forecast that trailed some analystsâ€™ estimates.  The stock dropped 13 percent to $30.26 at the close for the
biggest decline since Nov. 21, 2008. Before today, the shares
had jumped 15 percent this year.  Fiscal second-quarter earnings will be 46 cents to 51 cents
a share, excluding items such as stock-based compensation, the
 San Rafael , California-based company said yesterday after the
markets closed. Analysts anticipated 51 cents on average, based
on estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
