European Central Bank Governing
Council member Josef Bonnici said solidarity among European
countries will be key to implementing structural reforms,
suggesting nations enjoying lower refinancing costs should
subsidize more-indebted nations.  “One has to recognize that in the current circumstances,
the pursuit of a lower deficit by financially stressed countries
is inevitable and brings about a short-term slowdown in the
economy,” Bonnici said in a speech in Malta today. “An
increased recourse to EU cohesion and solidarity funds may help
alleviate the structural adjustment necessary and make the
economy of the program countries more competitive at the same
time.”  “Given the extent of the downturn in some  member states ,
this option is likely to require a strengthening of the EU
budget, which in turn needs to be financed,” Bonnici, who is
also head of the Central Bank of Malta, said. “However, not all
member states are in a stressed environment, and it may be
possible to consider other financing options, especially where
bond interest rates in some member states are rather low, even
below the inflation rate. EU-level solidarity and cohesion
assistance may prove a crucial catalyst to the required
structural changes.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
