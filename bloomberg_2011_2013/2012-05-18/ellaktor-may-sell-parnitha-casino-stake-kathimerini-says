Ellaktor SA (ELLAKTOR) , Greeceâ€™s biggest
builder, wants to sell non-construction related units, including
a stake in a casino, to reduce debt and boost liquidity,
 Kathimerini  said.  The company wants to dispose of its 15.3 percent Parnitha
Casino holding and Anemos, a wind energy unit, the Athens-based
newspaper said, citing unidentified Ellaktor executives. The
political uncertainty in Greece makes negotiations with
potential investors difficult, Kathimerini reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
