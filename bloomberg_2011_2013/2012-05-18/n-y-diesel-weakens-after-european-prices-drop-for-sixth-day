New York  diesel weakened as the fuel
in Europe fell for a sixth day on concern that Greece will have
to leave the euro currency union.  Gasoil for June delivery dropped 1.3 percent on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in  London . German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said financial-market turmoil caused by the
euro-zone debt crisis may last two more years.  Lower prices in Europe reduce incentive for the U.S. to
export the fuel.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in New York Harbor
fell 0.75 cent to 6.13 cents versus heating oil futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 9:08 a.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped 0.6 cent to
$2.9118 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  declined 0.8 cent to a
premium of 1.95 cents a gallon.  Royal Dutch Shell Plcâ€™s refinery in Deer Park, Texas,
released materials and shut a unit late yesterday, Emily Oberton, a company spokeswoman in Houston, said in an e-mail.
Operations stabilized within an hour, she said.  Emergency workers responded to a release from a sulfur unit
at the 340,000-barrel-a-day plant, according to a message left
on a community hot line.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the Gulf narrowed 1.75 cents to 1.5 cents a gallon versus
futures. Prompt delivery rose 3.27 cents to $2.8784 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
