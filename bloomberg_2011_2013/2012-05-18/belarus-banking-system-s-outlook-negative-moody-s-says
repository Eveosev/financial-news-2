Moody’s Investors Service retained
its negative outlook on Belarus’s banking system, saying assets
will deteriorate further and lenders will become more vulnerable
as the country’s ability to support the economy declines.  Moody’s expect growth of Belarusian gross domestic product
to slow to 0.5 percent this year from an estimated 5.3 percent
in 2011 with inflation remaining “excessively high” at 30
percent, the rating company said in its report published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
