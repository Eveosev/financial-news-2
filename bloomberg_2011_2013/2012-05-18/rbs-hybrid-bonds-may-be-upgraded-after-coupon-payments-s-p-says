Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s
hybrid bonds may be upgraded by  Standard & Poor’s  when the
state-owned lender pays its first coupons on the notes since the
European Commission lifted a ban on the payments.  S&P put some of RBS’s preferred securities with
discretionary coupon payments on CreditWatch positive today, the
ratings firm said in a statement. S&P expects to raise the
ratings to BB from C when payments resume.  The Edinburgh-based lender was prohibited from making
payments on the notes for two years under the terms of its
bailout by the U.K. government during the financial crisis. The
Commission lifted the ban at the end of April.  RBS said on May 4 it will start paying optional coupons and
dividends on hybrid capital notes, in what the bank called one
of its “important recovery milestones.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
