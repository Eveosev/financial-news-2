Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, the
baritone who led a worldwide revival in popularity for German
Lieder, has died, the Bavarian State Opera said. He was 86.  His wife, the soprano Julia Varady, told German press
agency DPA that he “fell gently asleep” in his home near
Starnberg in Bavaria.  Born in Berlin in 1925, Fischer-Dieskau began his
successful career in 1947 with a Lieder concert and at the
Berlin opera. Popular as an opera singer, he became best known
for his renditions of songs by Franz Schubert and Gustav Mahler.  “Through his interpretations of both Lieder and opera, he
made a decisive impact on the art of singing,” Nikolaus
Bachler, director of the Bavarian State Opera, said in a
statement sent by e-mail. “The Bavarian State Opera is mourning
one of its most important artists.”  He ended his singing career in 1992 with a gala concert in
Munich.  “Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau wrote German music history as a
singer and a performer,” German Culture Minister Bernd Neumann
said in an e-mailed statement. “His interpretations of German
lieder from Mozart to Schubert, Schumann, Brahms and  Richard Strauss  set yardsticks. His recordings of the ‘Winterreise’ are
unforgettable. For more than half a century, he touched
countless people across the whole world with his voice, in
hundreds of concerts and innumerable performances.”  To contact the writer on the story:
