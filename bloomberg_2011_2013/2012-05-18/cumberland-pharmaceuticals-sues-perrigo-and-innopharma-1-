Cumberland Pharmaceuticals (CPIX) , the maker
of  prescription drugs  for emergency medicine, accused generic-
drug makers  Perrigo Co. (PRGO)  and InnoPharma Inc. of infringing a
patent for  Acetadote , used to treat acetaminophen overdoses.  Cumberland, based in Nashville, contends Allegan, Michigan-
based Perrigo and InnoPharma of Piscataway, New Jersey, are
planning to introduce copies of the drug before the patent-
protection expires in 2026.  “Such conduct will constitute infringement” and create
“a reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm” to Cumberland,
its lawyers said in two complaints filed yesterday in Delaware
federal court in Wilmington.  Acetadote is used in hospital emergency rooms to limit
liver damage from life-threatening overuse of the pain reliever
acetaminophen -- a leading cause of poisoning in the U.S. --
according to Cumberland.  H. Rajan Sharma , InnoPharma general counsel, said the
company had no comment on the lawsuit. Arthur Shannon, a Perrigo
spokesman, didn’t immediately return phone and e-mail messages
seeking comment.  The cases are Cumberland v. Perrigo, 12cv619, and
Cumberland v. InnoPharma, 12cv618, U.S. District Court, District
of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 8,148,356.  To contact the reporter on this story:
