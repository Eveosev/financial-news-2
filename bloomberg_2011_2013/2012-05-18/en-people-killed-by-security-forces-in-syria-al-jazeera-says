Ten civilians were killed by security
forces today in Homs and the Syrian capital Damascus as crowds
took to the streets to protest after Friday prayers,  Al Jazeera 
TV reported, citing human rights activists.  An explosion and gunshots were heard in the suburb of
Altadamun in Damascus, Al Arabiya television reported earlier,
without giving details. Security forces fired at demonstrators
in Salah Eddine province in Aleppo, Harasta and Douma, Al
Jazeera said. Three people from the al-Dmeimeh village in Homs
province were killed by mortar attacks by “armed terrorist
groups,” the government-owned Syrian Arab News Agency said.  More than 9,000 people have been killed by President Bashar al-Assad security forces since March last year, when protests
began as part of the wave of uprisings in the  Middle East ,
according to a United Nations estimate in late March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
