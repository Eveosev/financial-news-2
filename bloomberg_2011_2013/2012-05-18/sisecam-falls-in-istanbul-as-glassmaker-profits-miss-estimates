Turkiye Sise & Cam Fabrikalari AS (SISE) ,
 Turkey ’s largest glass producer, fell to the lowest in almost
six months after the company and two of its units reported first
quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  The shares dropped 2.8 percent to 2.76 liras, their lowest
since Nov. 24.  Net income slid to 85.9 million liras ($46.9 million) from
123.1 million liras a year ago, Sisecam, as the company is
known, said in a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.
It was expected to earn 114.7 million liras, according to the
average of seven analyst estimates on Bloomberg.  Anadolu Cam Sanayii AS (ANACM) , a glassmaker in which Sisecam owns
a 79 percent stake, slipped 3.1 percent to 2.79 liras after
saying in a statement to the exchange yesterday its profit
declined to 10.5 million liras, missing the 15.5 million-lira
average estimate of four analysts on Bloomberg.  Trakya Cam Sanayii AS, in which Sisecam owns a 69 percent
stake, retreated 4.4 percent to 2.38 liras after net income
slumped to 11 million liras from 43.3 million liras in the same
period last year. The company was expected to earn 29.8 million
liras, according to the average of five analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
