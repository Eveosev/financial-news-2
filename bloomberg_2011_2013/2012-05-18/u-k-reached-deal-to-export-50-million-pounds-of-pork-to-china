The U.K. agreed to ship pork to
 China , the world’s biggest consumer of the meat, during
Agriculture Minister Jim Paice’s trade mission there, the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.  The deal, primarily to export offal, feet and other animal
parts, is worth 50 million pounds ($78.9 million), Defra said
today in a  statement  on its website. Tulip, the U.K.’s biggest
pork producer, is ready to send the first shipment, the
government said.  The British pig industry estimates that its pork trade with
China will soon be worth more than 50 million pounds a year,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
