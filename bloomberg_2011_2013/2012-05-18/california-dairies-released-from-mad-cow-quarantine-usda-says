Two California dairy farms
quarantined during a government investigation of the first U.S.
mad-cow disease case since 2006 have been released from
isolation, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said.  Most of the herd mates of the 10-year-old California animal
found last month to have mad cow disease are either dead or
ruled out as possible carriers of the disease, the USDA said
today in a  statement . The department said it is still searching
for about 10 to 12 animals that may be traceable.  “Of several hundred potential birth cohort cattle, the
focus of the tracing is on a small number,” the USDA said.
“The remaining potential cohorts are no longer alive or have
otherwise been ruled out.”  The nation’s fourth case of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, was confirmed by the USDA on
April 24. The first was discovered in December 2003, and U.S.
beef exports tumbled 82 percent to 460.3 million pounds during
the next 12 months as dozens of countries banned the product,
government data show. Most trade has resumed.  The most recent case prompted  Indonesia , why buys less than
1 percent of shipments, to ban U.S. beef.  To contact the reporter on this story:
