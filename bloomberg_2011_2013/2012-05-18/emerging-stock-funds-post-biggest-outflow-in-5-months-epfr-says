Emerging-market stock funds posted
their biggest weekly redemption in five months as  Greece ’s
political stalemate and concern  China’s economy  may slow more
than forecast weighed on investors, according to EPFR Global.  Developing-nation equity funds posted net outflows for the
week ended May 16 of $2.24 billion, according to a report e-
mailed today by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data
provider. For the week ended Dec. 21, emerging-market stock
funds recorded an outflow of $4.32 billion,  Cameron Brandt , EPFR
director of research, said by e-mail today.  Net investment into developing-nation  equity  funds totaled
$20.46 billion in 2012 compared with an outflow of $10.78
billion for the same period of 2011.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
recorded a net outflow for the week of $1.39 billion, the data
showed, while China-dedicated funds posted a net outflow of $135
million, Brandt said.  Russian equity funds showed a redemption of $52 million for
the week, pushing their total performance into the negative for
the first time since early February, EPFR said. Latin America-
dedicated funds posted an outflow of $273 million to lift total
redemptions for 2012 to $1.52 billion.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio posted a 4.28
percent loss for the week, cutting the 2012 advance to 3.08
percent, Brandt said. As of early March, emerging-market equity
portfolios had gained 16 percent in 2012.  Emerging-market bond funds registered inflows of $633.8
million for the week after attracting a net $1.05 billion in the
previous week, Brandt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
