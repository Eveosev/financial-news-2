The jury deciding the fate of former
presidential candidate  John Edwards , who is accused of using
illegal campaign donations to hide an extramarital affair, ended
its first day of deliberations without reaching a verdict.  About three hours into deliberations, the federal jury in
Greensboro, North Carolina, requested exhibits relating to
Rachel “Bunny” Mellon, one of two people whose payments to
Edwards are in dispute. Among the items requested were copies of
two checks Mellon wrote to an interior decorator that were later
deposited into the bank account of Edwards’s former campaign
aide,  Andrew Young .  The jury also asked to see an April 2007 letter Mellon sent
suggesting that Edwards send her “all bills” necessary and
important for his campaign after media reports on the price of
his haircuts. The jury will continue deliberating on May 21.  Edwards, a former U.S. senator from  North Carolina , a vice
presidential candidate in 2004 and a Democratic presidential
contender in 2008, was indicted in June after a two-year
investigation. He’s accused of illegally using almost $1 million
in campaign contributions from Mellon and  Fred Baron , a now-
deceased trial attorney, to hide his affair with Rielle Hunter.  He faces as long as five years in prison for each of the
six counts against him, if convicted.  The case is U.S. v. Edwards, 11-00161, U.S. District Court,
Middle District of North Carolina (Greensboro).  To contact the reporters on this story:
