Polish  jobs growth  at companies with
more than nine workers slowed along with wages, reinforcing
arguments for  interest rates  to remain unchanged after the
central bank became the first in the European Union this year to
raise borrowing costs.  Corporate employment increased 0.3 percent from a year
earlier after growing 0.5 percent in March, the Warsaw-based
 Central Statistical Office  said today. That’s below the 0.5
percent median estimate of 23 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Hiring fell 0.1 percent from the previous month.  The Narodowy Bank Polski raised its main rate by a quarter-
point to 4.75 percent on May 9, the first increase since last
June. Higher borrowing costs “do not appear warranted” given
government forecasts that inflation will ease this year as
economic growth slows to 2.5 percent from 4.3 percent in 2011,
the  International Monetary Fund  said this week.  “The number of employed will fall gradually as a result of
weakening economic activity, especially in the manufacturing and
construction industries,”  Marcin Mrowiec , chief economist at
Bank Pekao, wrote in a research note before the release.  Average gross wages advanced 3.4 percent from a year
earlier in April after a 3.8 percent rise the previous month,
the statistics office said in a separate release. That compares
with a 3.9 percent median forecast of 27 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Wages fell 1.3 percent from March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
