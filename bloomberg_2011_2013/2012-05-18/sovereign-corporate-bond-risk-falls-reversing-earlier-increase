The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, reversing an
earlier increase, according to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped
17.5 basis points to 738.5 at 12:30 p.m. in London. A decline
signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell one basis point to 305.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings decreased two basis points to 179.5.
The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25
banks and insurers fell 4.5 basis points to 300.5 and the
subordinated index declined 0.5 to 504.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
