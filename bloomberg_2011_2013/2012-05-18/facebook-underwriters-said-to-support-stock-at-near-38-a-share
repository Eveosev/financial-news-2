Facebook Inc. (FB)  underwriters purchased
the companyâ€™s stock to keep it from falling below $38 a share
after debuting on the Nasdaq Stock Market, people with knowledge
of the matter said.  The bankers supported the stock after  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) 
faced difficulties delivering trade execution messages after the
initial public offering, said one of the people, who asked not
to be identified because the transactions are private.  Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for  Menlo Park ,  California-based
Facebook , declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
