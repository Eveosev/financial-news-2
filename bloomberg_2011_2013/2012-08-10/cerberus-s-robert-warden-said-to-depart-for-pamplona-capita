Robert Warden joined Pamplona
Capital Management LP as a partner in  New York  after an 11-year
career at Cerberus Capital Management LLC, according to a person
with knowledge of the move.  Warden, 39, was a managing director at Cerberus and focused
on industrial-company deals, said the person, who asked not to
be named because his hiring hasn’t been made public. He worked
on transactions with companies including  BlueLinx Holdings Inc. (BXC) ,
 AerCap Holdings NV (AER)  and Aeroplan Holding GP Inc.  Peter Hewer, a spokesman for Pamplona, declined to comment.
Peter Duda, a spokesman for Cerberus, couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment.  Pamplona, based in London, oversees $6 billion in assets
including hedge funds and private equity, according to its
website. The firm is backed by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s Alfa Group and was started by Alex Knaster, former
chief executive officer of Moscow-based Alfa Bank.  Cerberus, run by  Stephen Feinberg , is seeking to raise
$3.75 billion for its next main private-equity fund. The New
York-based firm has commitments for about $1.3 billion, a person
familiar with the matter said earlier this month. It attracted
$7.5 billion from investors for its previous fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
