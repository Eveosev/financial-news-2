Nancy Shao Wen Chu, former chief
financial officer of  Soyo Group Inc. (SOYO) , was ordered to pay $15.6
million to resolve securities fraud charges, according to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Chu was accused by the SEC of inflating reported revenue at
Soyo, a now-defunct Ontario, California-based electronics
distributor, by booking more than $47 million in fictitious
sales in 2007 and 2008, the agency said today in a statement.
Eric Jon Strasser, a consultant the agency said was involved in
two fraudulent Soyo SEC filings, was ordered to pay $260,000.  False reports of 120 sales transactions and a $6 million
debt-for-equity transaction with a vendor misled investors,
bankers and auditors about Soyo’s financial health and lifted
its stock price, the SEC  said . Soyo filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy in 2009.  The SEC said neither Chu nor Strasser responded to the
initial complaint. Telephone listings under Chu’s name in
Ontario and for an Eric J. Strasser in Chino Hills, California,
were no longer in service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
