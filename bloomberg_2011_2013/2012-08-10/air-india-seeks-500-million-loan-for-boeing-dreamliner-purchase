Air India  Ltd., the state-owned
carrier, is seeking as much as $500 million of loans to help pay
for four Boeing Co. 787 planes.  The airline will repay the bridge loan by selling and
leasing back the aircraft, according to a tender  document  on its
website. Banks have until Aug. 24 to submit bids, it said.  The carrier’s first two Dreamliners, funded by a $195
million loan from Standard Chartered Plc, are scheduled to
arrive this month after the government approved a compensation
offer from Boeing for delivery delays. The airline will use the
fuel-efficient  787s  to start Sydney and Melbourne flights as it
seeks to attract more passengers and cut expenses in a bid to
end five years of losses.  Air  India  expects to have received a total of six 787s by
the end of the year, according to the tender. The bridge loan of
six to 12 months won’t be covered by a government guarantee, it
said.  The carrier, based in Mumbai, plans to sell and lease back
all of the 27 Dreamliners it has ordered as part of a financial
turnaround plan. It also intends to borrow $600 million overseas
to repay costlier working capital loans raised at home.  Air India has a  debt  of 235 billion rupees ($4.2 billion),
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As much as 110 billion
rupees of bonds and loans are due this year, the data show.  India has also offered the airline a 300 billion-rupee
state bailout, which is tied to meeting performance milestones
such as percentage of seats filled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
