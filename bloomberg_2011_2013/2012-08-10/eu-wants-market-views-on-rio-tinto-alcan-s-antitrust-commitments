Rio Tinto  Alcan Inc.’s commitments
to overcome European Union antitrust concerns it unlawfully tied
one of its technologies to its own equipment should be reviewed
with the aluminum smelting market, regulators said.  The European Commission, the EU regulator, asked
“interested parties” today to comment on commitments offered
by Montreal-based Rio Tinto Alcan to assuage antitrust concerns
over its practice of contractually tying its “AP aluminum
smelting technology” to aluminum smelter equipment it supplies.  “Rio Tinto Alcan may have a dominant position on the
relevant market for the licensing of aluminum smelting
technology and its contractual practice may lead to higher
prices, hamper innovation and shut out competitors” the
Brussels-based commission said its preliminary assessment shows.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest mining company,
acquired aluminum maker Alcan Inc. for $38 billion in 2007. The
EU investigation focuses on Alcan’s practices, and those of Rio
Tinto Alcan after the merger, according to the commission’s
statement today.  “We welcome this opportunity to conclude the European
Commission’s investigation into the sale of AP aluminum smelting
technology licenses,” London-based Rio Tinto said in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
