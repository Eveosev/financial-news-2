President  Barack Obama  ordered an
administration-wide initiative aimed at reducing violence
against women and girls globally, including human trafficking
and practices such as so-called honor killings.  An executive order issued today establishes a working group
headed by the secretary of state and the administrator of the
U.S. Agency for International Development that coordinate
programs, collect data and make the issue a U.S. foreign policy
priority.  The goal is to improve response measures and increase
government programming that addresses gender-based violence,
according to a White House statement.  Representatives from Cabinet departments including the
Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, and the
Department of Homeland Security, as well as agencies such as the
Peace Corps will be part of the working group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
