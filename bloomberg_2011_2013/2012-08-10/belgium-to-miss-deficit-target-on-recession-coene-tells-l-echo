Belgium’s  budget deficit  will miss
the 2012 target and exceed the European Union’s ceiling of 3
percent of gross domestic product as the economy slides into a
recession, Belgian central bank Governor Luc Coene told L’Echo.  Belgium’s economy will probably shrink this year, pushing
the budget deficit “slightly above” 3 percent of GDP, the
newspaper cited Coene as saying in an interview published today.
Following a 0.6 percent economic contraction in the second
quarter, the remainder of the year will likely be “more
negative than positive,” Coene said, according to L’Echo.  Coene urged Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo’s government to cut
spending, saying expenditure growth that is outpacing economic
expansion is one of the key structural weaknesses of Belgian
public finances, the newspaper reported.  Belgium  should be
“very careful” not to get caught up in the turmoil of the debt
crisis again, Coene told L’Echo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
