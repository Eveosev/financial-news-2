Hungary ’s central bank must be “an
anchor” and pursue a “cautious” monetary policy to prevent
large “swings” in the forint as well as helping improve the
country’s risk assessment, Deputy Governor Ferenc Karvalits said
in an interview with weekly magazine  Magyar Narancs .  “Unfounded monetary easing would lead to capital outflow
through the weakening of the forint, which in turn would incur
much bigger damage to economic growth than the the current,
regionally high level of  interest rates ,” Karvalits said in the
interview published today.  Moves by politicians to spend foreign-currency reserves
would “jeopardize the country’s solvency,” Karvalits said,
adding that members of the Monetary Council “judge similarly”
the importance of reserves, Narancs reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
