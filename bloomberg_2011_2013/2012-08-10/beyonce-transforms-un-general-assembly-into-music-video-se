Pop star Beyonce tonight turned the
 United Nations General Assembly  into the set of her latest music
video, performing a live solo against a giant backdrop of filmed
floods, wars and children in need.  Clad in a glittering floor-length white gown, the 30-year-
old entertainer belted out her power ballad “I Was Here” to an
audience of celebrities including Hollywood actress Julia Stiles
in a 1,800-seat hall that typically hosts world leaders and top
diplomats debating conflicts and global affairs.  The multiple-Grammy-award winning singer, whose hits
include “Single Ladies,” is donating the proceeds from her
newest single and tonight’s video to the UN. The video will be
broadcast worldwide on Aug. 19, which the UN has designated as
World Humanitarian Day.  Footage of the plight of the developing world and the
efforts of UN humanitarian workers filled a horseshoe-shaped
canvas that wrapped around the General Assembly Hall as Beyonce
sang about wanting to leave a mark with lyrics such as “The
hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave. That I
made a difference, and this world will see.”  As part of  social media outreach  seeking 1 billion
supporters for World Humanitarian Day, people worldwide are
urged to sign up for the campaign via Twitter and Facebook and
do “something good, somewhere, for someone else.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
