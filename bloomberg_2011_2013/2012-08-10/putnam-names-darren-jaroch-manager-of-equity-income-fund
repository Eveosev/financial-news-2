Putnam Investments  said Darren A.
Jaroch will become portfolio manager of the $3.6 billion Putnam
Equity Income Fund, replacing Bartlett R. Geer, who will be
leaving the firm.  Jaroch, who has been with Boston-based Putnam since 1999,
will continue to manage the $192 million Putnam International
Value Fund, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
That fund trailed 65 percent of its peers over the past three
years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The fund is beating 90
percent of peers this year.  Geer managed Equity Income since 2000. The fund beat 68
percent of rivals over the past five years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Putnam had $122 billion in assets under management as of
July 31, according to the statement.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
