Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco  John Williams  said the central bank should ease policy
further amid signs the expansion is slowing, according to the
San Francisco Chronicle.  Weakening employment, consumer spending and gross domestic
product growth suggest the central bank should begin a third
round of bond purchases, Williams said in an interview with the
newspaper.  Williams, a voting member of the Federal Open Market
Committee this year, joins other Fed presidents including  Eric Rosengren  of Boston and Charles Evans of Chicago in calling for
more efforts to support the U.S. economy. The unemployment rate
rose to 8.3 percent last month even as the economy added more
jobs, Labor Department figures showed on Aug. 3.  The economy is likely to grow 1.8 percent in the second
half of this year, and the  unemployment rate  will probably
remain at 8.3 percent through this year, Williams said,
according to the Chronicle. Europe’s debt crisis is also
inhibiting U.S. growth, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
