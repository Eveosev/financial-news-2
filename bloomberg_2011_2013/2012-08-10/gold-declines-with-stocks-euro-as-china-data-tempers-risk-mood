Gold futures advanced for a third
straight day on speculation that  China  may take more steps to
boost economic growth, increasing demand for the precious metal
as a store of value.  China’s exports rose 1 percent in July from a year earlier,
compared with the 8 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey and 11.3 percent in June. The nation’s new local-currency
loans were 540.1 billion  yuan  ($85 billion) last month, the
People’s Bank of China said. That compared with the median
estimate of 700 billion yuan in a Bloomberg survey.  “Renewed hopes for more monetary stimulus from PBOC are
providing some support for gold,” Standard Bank Plc said in a
report e-mailed today.  Gold futures for December delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,622.80 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , extending the weekly gain to 0.8 percent. The metal has
risen 3.6 percent this year.  Silver futures for September delivery slipped 0.1 percent
to $28.062 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery dropped 0.9 percent to $1,399.90 an ounce,
extending the weekly loss to 1 percent. Palladium futures for
September delivery retreated 0.8 percent to $582.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
