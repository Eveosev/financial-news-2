U.S. stocks rose, erasing declines,
as a rebound in financial and industrial shares helped the
market recover from an early slump amid optimism the  Federal
Reserve  will step in with additional stimulus measures.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2 percent to
1,405.38, reversing an earlier decline of as much as
0.5 percent sparked by disappointing economic data from China.  “The weaker the data the higher the likelihood of stimulus
from central banks,” said  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at
RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond, Virginia, which
oversees about $47 billion. “The weakness in China is likely to
prompt a move there. What happens in the rest of the world can
affect the U.S. Global growth is weak and getting weaker. While
the Fed has been clear it will do anything to support growth,
some people tend to think it’s inevitable.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
