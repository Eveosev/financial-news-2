Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, the
24-year-old investment bank that focuses on financial clients,
fired about 20 people in units including trading and deal
advisory, said people with direct knowledge of the decisions.  Dismissals resulted from a slump in trading and in mergers
and acquisitions, said one of the people, who asked to remain
anonymous because the reductions were private. The firm will
still employ more than 300 people, the person said. Departing
executives include  Scott Buchta , a managing director and head of
mortgage strategy, and Michael Schramm, who traded commercial
mortgage-backed securities, the people said.  Economic weakness in the U.S. and Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis led Wall Street’s five biggest banks to post their lowest
first-half profit this year since 2008.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  are among firms shrinking parts of their
investment-banking units to reduce costs.  David Franecki, a spokesman for New York-based Sandler
O’Neill, declined to comment on the firings. The firm, founded
in 1988 with a focus on serving community banks, also has
offices in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta and Memphis,
Tennessee, according to its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
