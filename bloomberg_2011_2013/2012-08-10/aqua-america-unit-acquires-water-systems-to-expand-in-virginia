Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , a water and
wastewater service provider, said its Virginia subsidiary
acquired Fox Run Water Co. and Moseley-Nash Enterprises water
system assets to expand further in that state.  The  Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania-based company, which serves
almost 3 million customers in 10 U.S. states from New Jersey to
Texas, said the $400,000 acquisition will add 26 water systems
in the Lake Gaston area near North Carolinaâ€™s border.  The company also said today that it plans to spend about
$1.4 million on environmental and capital upgrades including
pipes and disinfection equipment over the next five years for
the systems and expects to complete the acquisition of 12 Fox
Run water systems in  North Carolina  later this year.  Last month, Aqua America reported record earnings for the
second quarter on an 11 percent rise in revenue and an Ohio
acquisition. The shares have advanced 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
