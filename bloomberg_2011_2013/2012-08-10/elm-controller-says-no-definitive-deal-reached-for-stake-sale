Helm Corp., the holding company that
controls  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB) , said it is studying options for its
controlling stake in the Bogota-based lender and that no
“definitive” agreement has been reached.  The holding company said in a regulatory filing after the
market closed that it “continues in the process of evaluating
different strategic business alternatives for the bank and no
definitive transaction has been finalized.”  La Republica newspaper reported Aug. 6 that Chile’s
 Corpbanca (CORPBANC)  agreed to acquire Helm Bank for more than $1.3
billion.  Speculation about a takeover has helped drive Helm Bank up
62 percent this year, outpacing the benchmark IGBC Index’s 9.5
percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
