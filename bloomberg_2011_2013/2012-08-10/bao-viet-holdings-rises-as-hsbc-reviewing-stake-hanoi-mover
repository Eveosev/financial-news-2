Bao Viet Holdings (BVH) , Vietnam’s biggest
insurer, rose to the highest in more than two weeks after  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  said it’s reviewing options for its stake in the
company.  Shares of the Hanoi-based company advanced 1.2 percent to
42,700 dong as of 1:02 p.m. local time, headed for the highest
close since July 24. The stock earlier surged as much as 2.4
percent. Vietnam’s benchmark  VN Index (VNINDEX)  fell 0.2 percent.  HSBC is reviewing options for its 18 percent stake in Bao
Viet, the London-based bank said in a statement yesterday. “No
decision has been made as yet and HSBC will make a further
statement if or when appropriate,” it said in the statement.  “There are market expectations an  insurance industry 
heavyweight with more clout to help restructure the company and
bring in new products might replace HSBC as a strategic partner
for Bao Viet,” Ho Chi Minh City-based Attila Vajda, a broker at
ACB Securities Co., said in a phone interview. “As such, and as
more news comes out on this deal as it progresses, there might
some positive catalysts for the stock.”  Sumitomo Life is in talks to acquire the stake, Japan’s
Nikkei newspaper reported July 19, without citing where it got
the information from. HSBC bought 10 percent of Bao Viet in 2007
for $255 million. It increased that to 18 percent in a deal
completed in January 2010.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
