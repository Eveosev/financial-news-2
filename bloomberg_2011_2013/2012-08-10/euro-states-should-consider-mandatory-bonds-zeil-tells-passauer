Troubled euro-region countries such
as  Spain  should tap their citizens’ wealth first before seeking
international aid, Bavaria’s Deputy Prime Minister Martin Zeil
told the  Passauer Neue Presse  newspaper.  With private wealth in Spain amounting to four times public
debt, a “repayable mandatory bond” could help stabilize public
finances and should be considered before asking for German
taxpayer money, the newspaper cited Zeil, who’s also the state’s
economy minister, as saying.  The euro region’s financial backstops should cut off
funding if recipients don’t meet their obligations, even at the
cost of two or more countries exiting the euro, Zeil said. That
would neither lead to a collapse of the euro’s core, nor to the
wider “House of  Europe ,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
