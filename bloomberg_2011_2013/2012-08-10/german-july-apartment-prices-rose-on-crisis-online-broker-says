Asking prices for German apartments
rose in July as buyers sought a safe investment amid the euro
zone crisis, with values in Berlin and Hamburg gaining the most.  Prices demanded for previously owned apartments jumped 7
percent in July from a year earlier, Internet real estate broker
 ImmobilienScout 24  said in a statement today. Berlin and Hamburg
prices rose 16.8 percent in July from a year earlier. Asking
prices for all of  Germany  have risen about 10 percent in the
past five years, the Berlin-based company said.  German real estate has been among the biggest beneficiaries
of  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis as investors bet that land and
buildings will retain value even if inflation spikes. Demand is
highest in large cities such as Berlin and Hamburg because
Germans are moving to areas where jobs are easier to find.  Concerns about inflation are growing as discussions about
the euro zone’s future intensify, Michael Kiefer,
ImmobilienScout’s head of valuations, said in the statement.  “This debate will continue fueling demand for real estate
as a supposed safe haven,” Kiefer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
