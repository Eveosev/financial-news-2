Express Scripts  Holding Co., the
largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, plans to divest a
diabetic testing supply business and some units under its
research subsidiary.  The company also will dissolve a venture in  China  and wind
down a business in Germany and  France , Express Scripts said
today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The St. Louis-based company will also exit its European
headquarters in Amsterdam. The company’s research subsidiary is
United BioSource.  The decisions come after Express Scripts completed an
acquisition of competitor Medco Health Solutions Inc. in April.
The company increased its profit forecast Aug. 7 amid signs of a
successful integration and said it expects a profit of $3.60 to
$3.75 a share this year, compared with a May forecast of $3.36
to $3.66.  “We are in the process of reviewing the strategic
alternatives for several of our adjacent businesses which are
not core to our PBM offering,” said Jeffrey Hall, chief
financial officer, in an Aug. 8 earnings call. “We do not
expect the ultimate disposition of these businesses to have a
material impact on our financial results.”  Express Scripts fell less than 1 percent to $61.92 at the
close in  New York . The shares have gained 39 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
