Robusta coffee demand may have
climbed by 15 percent, or 9 million bags, in the 2011-12 season
that started in October, according to Volcafe, the coffee unit
of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Robusta coffee inventories in Europe and  Japan  have fallen
by 3.5 million bags since the beginning of the season, the
Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader said in a weekly report e-
mailed today. Robusta bean exports advanced 11 percent to a
record 31.7 million bags for the season through June, according
to the  International Coffee Organization  in  London .  “Even if we expect end-season carryover from the enormous
and record  Vietnam  crop to be 1.5 million bags bigger than last
year, this continuous drawdown of robusta inventories is
indicating a reasonable deficit occurred this year, which means
that robusta demand saw spectacular, spectacular growth,”
Volcafe said in the report. Vietnam is the biggest grower.  Robusta coffee prices climbed 20 percent so far this year
as demand increased. The beans, which are gown mainly in Asia
and parts of Africa, are used in instant drinks and espresso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
