Cotton output in the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter, will be 3.8 percent higher than
forecast last month as the crop in  Texas  rebounds, the
government said. Analysts expected less production.  The harvest that’s about to get under way will bring
in 17.65 million bales, up from 17 million forecast in
July, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
report. The average estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey was 16.8 million bales. The previous crop
totaled 15.57 million bales, each weighing 480 pounds, or
218 kilograms.  About 41 percent of the crop was in good-to-excellent
condition as of Aug. 5, compared with 30 percent at the
same time last year, when plants in Texas, the top grower,
were being scorched by the state’s worst drought in at
least a century, the agency said this week.  The crop in Texas was estimated at 6.725 million
bales, up 90 percent from last year, the USDA report
showed.  Futures Plunge  Cotton futures have plunged 65 percent since reaching
a record high of $2.197 a pound in March 2011, as the rally
eroded demand and boosted global output. The price closed
yesterday at 75.95 cents.  U.S. growers may export 12.1 million bales in the
marketing year that began Aug. 1, up from 11.71 million in
the previous season, the USDA said. Unsold supplies at the
end of the marketing year will total 5.5 million bales, up
67 percent from 3.3 million this year, according to the
report.  Yields may reach 784 pounds per acre, down from 790
pounds in the previous year, the USDA said.  World output will reach 114.11 million bales, down 7 percent
from 122.67 million the previous year, the USDA said. Last month’s
estimate was for 113.81 million bales.  Consumption will be 108.16 million bales, up 2.6
percent from 105.38 million last year, the department said.  Global stockpiles on July 31, 2013, may total 74.67
million bales, up from 72.39 million projected in July, the
USDA said.  Estimated inventories in  China , the biggest user of
the fiber, at the end of this marketing year were raised
7.5 percent to 34.18 million bales from 31.8 million
forecast in July. China will import 13 million bales in the
next season, down 46 percent from 24.25 million last year,
the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
