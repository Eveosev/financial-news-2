51job Inc. (JOBS)  gained the most in 22
months as the Shanghai-based recruiting service forecast better-
than-expected third-quarter profit, pushing Chinese stocks traded
in  New York  to their best weekly performance of the year.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. rose 0.5 percent to 91.93,
extending its advance for the week to 5.2 percent, the largest
gain since Dec. 2.  Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD)  tumbled the
most since April as the mobile chipmaker forecast third-quarter
sales that trailed estimates.  VanceInfo Technologies Inc. (VIT)  slid
the most in eight months after cutting its forecast for adjusted
profit in 2012.  51job said it expects third-quarter profit of 66 cents per
share on sales of as much as $58.2 million. The company said
second-quarter adjusted net income was 66 cents per American
depositary share on $56.7 million in sales, beating the estimate
of one analyst surveyed by Bloomberg. Of the 21 companies on the
Bloomberg gauge that have  reported earnings  since mid-July, 36
percent have beat analysts’ profit estimates.  “Expectations about the second quarter were so low that
investors were pleased that the company’s reassuring outlook
suggests their market is stable and hasn’t deteriorated,” Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at Oberweis Asset Management Inc., which
manages $700 million and holds shares in 51job, said yesterday
by phone from Lisle,  Illinois . “51job’s competitive position
continues to improve as they’re probably gaining some market
share in the downturn.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 0.2 percent to $35.23
from a three-month high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of the
biggest U.S. shares added 0.2 percent to 1,405.87, extending its
winning streak to six days.  51job Jumps  51job surged 20 percent to $43.84, the biggest advance
since Oct. 13, 2010, on volume that was four times the stock’s
three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The climate for hiring in China isn’t the same as in
2008-2009 when employers were “a little bit shell-shocked and
just didn’t know what to do,” said 51Jobs Chief Operating
Officer Kathleen Chien during an Aug. 9 conference call.  Spreadtrum lost 12 percent to $17.09, the largest decline
since April 16. The Shanghai-based company forecast third-
quarter revenue of $178 million to $186 million, below the $188
million average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  China ’s exports rose 1 percent in July from a year earlier,
the customs bureau said yesterday in Beijing, after climbing
11.3 percent in June.  VanceInfo Sinks  “The overall sales data from Chinese companies hasn’t been
good and earnings have been deteriorating,” Jingyi Li, an
analyst at Harding Loevner LP, whose $19 billion in assets under
management includes Chinese equities, said in a phone interview
yesterday from Bridgewater,  New Jersey . “The overall economy is
slowing and the recovery will be mild. We’re not in a panic
situation though the authorities there will be under pressure to
take actions to stimulate.”  Beijing-based VanceInfo tumbled 11 percent to $8.85 after
the company said it expects to report adjusted earnings per
American depositary share between 75 cents and 81 cents, less
than a previous forecast as high as 92 cents per share. The
average  estimate  for 2012 net income was 88 cents per share,
according to 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  HiSoft Merger  “Vance has struggled to deliver a consistent margin
profile,” said Joseph Foresi, an analyst at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in  Boston . “Revenues were actually revised upward, so
the fact that they had to bring down earnings is concerning
because maybe it leads to further inconsistency.”  Foresi has a neutral rating on VanceInfo. VanceInfo raised
its 2012 sales forecast to $372 million to $376 million,
exceeding an average analyst estimate of $369.6 million.  VanceInfo and HiSoft, which counts  General Electric Co. (HSFT)  and
Microsoft Corp. as customers, agreed to an all-stock merger in
which shareholders would each own approximately 50 percent of
the combined company. HiSoft will be the surviving listed stock,
and the new company will be headed by HiSoft Chief Executive
Officer Tiak Koon Loh, the companies said.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.2 percent yesterday to
2,168.81 while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese
companies traded in  Hong Kong  lost 0.6 percent to 9,905.22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
