Former Lebanese Information Minister
Michel Samaha, an ally of  Syria , has admitted to a role in a
plot to carry out attacks in Lebanon and was caught on a video
saying Syrian President Bashar al-Assad “wants” this, the
 Daily Star  reported, citing unidentified security officials.  The video was shot two weeks before police arrested Samaha
yesterday, the newspaper said today. It said Samaha admitted to
personally transferring a number of explosives from Syria to
Lebanon. The planting and the timing of the bombs were meant to
coincide with a visit to the northern region of Akkar by
Maronite Patriarch Beshara Rai, the  Daily Star  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
