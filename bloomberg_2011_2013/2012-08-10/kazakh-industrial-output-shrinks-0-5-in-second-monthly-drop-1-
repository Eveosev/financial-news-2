Kazakh industrial output
unexpectedly shrank in July for a second month as production of
metals slumped.  Output at factories, mines and utilities dropped 0.5
percent from a year earlier after a 1.7 percent decrease in
June, the Astana-based state statistics agency said on its
 website  today. The median estimate of four economists in a
Bloomberg  survey  was for 0.5 percent growth. Production fell 3.5
percent in July on a monthly basis.  Kazakhstan , which last week reduced its main  interest rate 
for a fourth time this year, is following emerging economies
from  Brazil  to  India  in lowering borrowing costs. While the
government predicts the economy of the second-biggest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union  will gain 7 percent in 2012
and maintain that pace of expansion until 2015,  gross domestic
product  grew 5.6 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier.  Iron-ore production slumped 6.6 percent in July and non-
ferrous metal-ore production fell 2.9 percent from a year
earlier, according to the statistics agency. Production of crude
oil and natural gas climbed 8.7 percent and 5.1 percent,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
