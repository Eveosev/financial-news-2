The Philippine peso fell, reversing
a weekly advance, after growth in exports slowed more than
economists estimated amid a faltering global recovery.  Overseas shipments rose 4.2 percent in June from a year
earlier, compared with a 20 percent gain in May, the statistics
office said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a 12 percent increase. The peso has advanced 4.6
percent this year,  Asia ’s best performer, prompting Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas to cut its benchmark  interest rate  last
month for the third time in 2012 to curb currency strength.  “The Philippines isn’t bucking the overall softness in
Asian exports,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte
in  Singapore . “The constant here is worries about BSP
intervention. The peso has been range-bound” in the last few
weeks, she said.  The currency dropped 0.3 percent to 41.890 per dollar at
the close in  Manila , for a weekly loss of 0.1 percent, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 25 basis
points, or 0.25 percentage point, today and this week to 5.75
percent. Ten-year bonds were little changed for the five days.  Global funds bought $2.2 billion more Philippine stocks
than they sold this year, exchange data show.  Michael Spencer ,
the Hong Kong-based chief economist for Asia at Deutsche Bank AG,
said in a Bloomberg TV interview yesterday that the $225 billion
economy is the strongest performer in Asia. Gross domestic
product rose 6.4 percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace
since 2010.  The Philippines has tools to address challenges posed by
weak global growth and strong capital inflows, central bank
Governor Amando Tetangco said on Aug. 4  The yield on the government’s 4.875 percent bonds due
August 2022 was at 4.845 percent today, compared with 4.85
percent yesterday and last week, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
