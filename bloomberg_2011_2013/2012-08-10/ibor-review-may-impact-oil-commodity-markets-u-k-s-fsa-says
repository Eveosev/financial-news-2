A review of the  London  interbank
offered rate, or Libor, will probably have ramifications for the
way oil and other commodities are priced, according to the
U.K.’s Financial Services Authority.  “The Libor consultation may have implications for other
financial benchmarks, including those for oil, gold and other
commodity prices, which may eventually be reviewed at a global
level,” Martin Wheatley, the managing director of the FSA, said
today in a speech at Bloomberg LP’s office in London.  Wheatley, 53, said the FSA is conducting the review after
Barclays Plc, the U.K.’s second-largest bank, was fined 290
million pounds ($453 million) by U.S. and U.K. authorities in
June for rigging  interest rates .  Separately, the International Organization of Securities
Commissions, whose members include the FSA, was appointed by the
Group of 20 nations in November to undertake an investigation
into the way price reporting agencies operate. The group will
publish a final report later this year ahead of the next G-20
summit. IOSCO has outlined concerns that  oil prices  are at risk
of manipulation in a preliminary finding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
