Swedenâ€™s central bank has not done
enough to stimulate the economy through lower  interest rates ,
Dagens Nyheter reported, citing an interview with Deputy
Governor Lars E. O. Svensson.  The  main lending rate  has been too high in the last 15
years, resulting in unemployment that has been 0.8 percentage
point higher than it would have been with a looser monetary
policy, the newspaper cited Svensson as saying.  The Riksbank board should include more professors with
sound knowledge of macroeconomics, monetary policy and financial
stability, Dagens Nyheter reported him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
