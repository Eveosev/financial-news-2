Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s largest
consumer-electronics company, rose the most in two weeks in
Tokyo trading after saying it would buy out  So-net Entertainment
Corp. (3789)  to boost its online entertainment business.  Sony climbed 2.7 percent to 947 yen, the biggest gain since
July 27. So-net jumped by its daily limit of 70,000 yen, or 21
percent, to 402,000 yen after the 61-billion-yen ($776 million)
offer. Sony yesterday said it will pay 567,500 yen for each So-
net share. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index fell 1 percent.  The electronics maker is cutting costs and trying to boost
revenue as President  Kazuo Hirai  tries to revive the company
after four straight annual  losses . The deal will help Tokyo-
based Sony integrate So-net’s online transmission network and
boost entertainment services in Japan and the rest of  Asia , the
company said in the statement.  “Sony should be able to achieve a tax-saving benefit
through the use of the group corporation tax system,”  Yuji Fujimori , a Tokyo-based analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a
report yesterday. “We hope to see swift realization of synergy
benefits with So-net, which Sony indicates it wants to retain as
an independent business.”  TV Restructuring  So-net owns a 56 percent stake in  M3 Inc. (2413) , which provides
medical information to doctors through the Internet. Sony plans
to expand its medical business, seeking alliance with  Olympus
Corp. (7733) , the world’s biggest endoscope maker. M3 rose 6.5 percent
to 442,000 yen.  Sony plans to buy as many as 107,772 shares of So-net by
Sept. 20, it said in a statement yesterday. Sony already owns a
45.61 percent stake in the company, while its financial unit
holds an additional 12.57 percent, according to the statement.  Hirai, 51, is restructuring Sony’s main TV business and has
pledged to revive the company by focusing on game players,
digital imaging and mobile devices. The electronics maker is
eliminating 6 percent of the company’s workforce.  In February, the maker of Experia phones completed the
purchase of Ericsson AB’s 50 percent stake in their 10-year-old
mobile-phone venture after agreeing in October to buy it for
1.05 billion euros ($1.3 billion) to integrate the smartphone
business with its gaming and tablet offerings.  Sony also sold its stake in a venture with Samsung
Electronics Co. to make liquid-crystal displays to the South
Korean company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
