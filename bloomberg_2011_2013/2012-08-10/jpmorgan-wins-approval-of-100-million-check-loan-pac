  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  won
preliminary court approval of a $100 million settlement with
credit-card holders who sued the bank over claims it increased
required minimum payments after promising a fixed  interest rate .  U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney in San Francisco granted
tentative approval to the so-called check loan agreement
yesterday. A final hearing is scheduled for Nov. 16.  The accord resolves a class action, or group lawsuit, filed
on behalf of 1 million cardholders. The settlement fund
represents about one-half of the up-front transaction fees
cardholders paid on their credit card loans, lawyers for
customers said court papers filed last month.  The case is In re Chase Bank USA NA “Check Loan” Contract
Litigation, 09-2032, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
