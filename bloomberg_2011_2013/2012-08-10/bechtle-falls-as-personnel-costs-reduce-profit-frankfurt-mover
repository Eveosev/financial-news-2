Bechtle AG (BC8) , the German computer and
software retailer that went public in 2000, fell the most in
almost three months after second-quarter earnings missed analyst
estimates because of higher human-resources costs.  Bechtle lost as much as 4.3 percent to 30.06 euros, the
biggest intraday drop since May 18, and was trading down 3
percent at 3:37 p.m. in  Frankfurt . Bechtle was the third biggest
decliner on the  German HDAX Index (HDAX)  today.  Earnings before interest and tax fell 21 percent from a
year earlier to 15.4 million euros ($18.9 million), and was less
than the average  estimate  of 18.2 million euros. Pretax profit
dropped 24 percent to 15.1 million euros, the Neckarsulm-based
company said today in a statement.  Higher personnel expenses and an increase in depreciation
and amortization costs stemming from acquisitions were
responsible for earnings decline, the company said. Bechtle
stuck to a 2012 forecast of revenue rising faster than the
market’s growth, while a goal of matching or exceeding 2011
earnings now “appears to be rather ambitious.”  “Bechtle’s management has become more cautious,” Tim Wunderlich, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Hauck & Aufhaeuser
Privatbankiers KGaA, said in a phone interview today. “The
market will lower its consensus for 2012 by up to 10 percent.”  The second quarter also presented  difficult circumstances
in some European countries and a “deteriorated domestic
economy,” Bechtle said. The  S&P Europe 350 Software & Services
Industry Group Index (SESFTW)  declined 7.9 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
