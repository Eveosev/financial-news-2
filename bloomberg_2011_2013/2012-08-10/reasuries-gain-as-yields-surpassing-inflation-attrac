Treasuries gained after benchmark
10-year rates rose to surpass the pace of inflation yesterday,
offering a so-called positive real yield for the first time in
14 months.  Ten-year rates climbed as high as 1.73 percent, versus the
1.7 percent level of consumer-price increases in the U.S.
Treasuries have lagged behind inflation since May 2011, leading
 Bill Gross , who manages the world’s biggest bond fund at Pacific
Investment Management Co., to warn that it is a form of
“ financial repression .” Signs of waning growth worldwide
including a slowdown in Chinese exports are bolstering demand
for the safety of U.S. government securities.  “The real  interest rate  is becoming more attractive,”
said Kazuaki Oh’e, a debt salesman in  Tokyo  at CIBC World
Markets Japan Inc., a unit of  Canada ’s fifth-largest lender.
“The world economy is shrinking, and that means investors would
like to buy bonds.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  declined four basis points to 1.65
percent as of 6:46 a.m. in  London  today from yesterday’s closing
level, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the
1.625 percent security due in August 2022 advanced 11/32, or
$3.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 3/4. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Japan ’s 10-year rate slid 1/2 basis point to 0.795 percent,
falling for the first time this week.  U.S. Inflation  U.S. consumer price gains probably slowed to 1.5 percent in
July from the year before, versus June’s 1.7 percent reading,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists before the
Labor Department reports the data on Aug. 15. The figure would
translate into a 10-year real yield of 16 basis points, climbing
from negative 2.11 percentage points in October.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, was 2.29 percentage points. The average over the past
decade is 2.15 percentage points.  Gross wrote in his July  outlook  that investors are in an
era where “negative real rates on Treasuries and its incumbent
financial repression dominate bond and asset markets.”  Today’s gain in Treasuries interrupted a decline that has
sent prices down for three weeks, the longest run since
February, as signs of improvement in the U.S. labor market
increased demand for higher-yielding assets.  The economy added 163,000 jobs in July, a government report
showed Aug. 3, more than the 100,000 projected by economists.
Initial claims for  unemployment insurance  unexpectedly dropped
by 6,000 to 361,000 in the week ended Aug. 4, a report showed
yesterday.  Auction Demand  Demand waned at sales of 3-, 10- and 30-year Treasuries
this week. The 10-year auction on Aug. 8 drew  bids  for 2.49
times the amount of debt available, dropping from 3.61 at the
prior auction on July 11.  “Many investors saw the employment data and stopped
buying,” said Hiromasa Nakamura, who invests in Treasuries in
Tokyo at Mizuho Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of $41.9 billion and is part of Japan’s third-biggest
bank. “All three auctions were weak.”  Corporate bonds outperformed government debt as investors
sought higher rates while 10-year Treasury yields fell to a
record low of 1.38 percent on July 25.  U.S. government securities have returned 1.9 percent in
2012 as of yesterday, versus 7.7 percent for an index of
investment-grade and high-yield company debt, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch data. The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) 
of stocks handed investors a 10 percent gain including
reinvested dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are willing to accept 2.67 percentage points of
extra yield to own company debt instead of Treasuries, versus
3.48 percentage points at the end of last year, based on the
Bank of America data.  Pimco’s Gross  Gross cut the proportion of Treasury debt in Pimco’s $263
billion Total Return Fund to 33 percent of assets last month
from 35 percent in July, according to a report on the  Newport
Beach ,  California , company’s  website  yesterday. Mortgages
comprised 51 percent, from 52 percent. Holdings of bonds in
developed markets outside the U.S. rose to 6 percent from 5
percent.  Signs of slowing economic growth around the world are
supporting bonds today, CIBC’s Oh’e said.  China ’s exports rose 1 percent in July from the year
before, versus 11.3 percent in June, while  Singapore ’s economy
shrank, reports today showed.  Japan’s  gross domestic product  probably expanded at an
annual pace of 2.3 percent in the second quarter, half the rate
of the prior three months, a Bloomberg News survey of economists
showed. The Cabinet Office will release the figure on Aug. 13.  The  Federal Reserve  plans to sell as much as $8 billion of
Treasuries maturing from July 2013 to January 2014 today,
according to the  website  of its  New York  branch. The sales are
part of the central bank’s effort to support the economy by
swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings with those due
in six to 30 years, putting downward pressure on long-term
borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
