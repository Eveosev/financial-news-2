JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
 U.S. bank  by assets, was sued by  Bank Hapoalim BM (POLI)  over
$361.2 million in residential mortgage-backed securities in New
York state court.  Israel’s second-biggest bank is seeking damages for claims
including common-law fraud, fraudulent inducement and negligent
misrepresentation, according to court filing today in Manhattan.
The bank accuses JPMorgan of making material misrepresentations
in the offering materials for the investments.  “Plaintiff did not know the true facts regarding
defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions in the offering
materials, and justifiably relied on those misrepresentations
and omissions,” Bank Hapoalim said in the filing. “Defendants’
wrongdoing has led directly to plaintiff’s damages, which
include loss of market value on the securities.”  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the suit.  Bank Hapoalim, based in Tel Aviv, sued Charlotte-based Bank
of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. bank, in the same
court in April over $721 million worth of residential mortgage-
backed securities.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  The case is Bank Hapoalim BM v. JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
652799/2012, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
