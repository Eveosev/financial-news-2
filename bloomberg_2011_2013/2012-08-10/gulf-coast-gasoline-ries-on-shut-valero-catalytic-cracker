Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened to
the highest level in a week as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  shut a
catalytic cracker for unplanned maintenance at its Norco
refinery in Louisiana.  The 100,000-barrel-a-day unit is expected to resume service
before the end of the month, Bill Day, a San Antonio-based
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the Gulf Coast, rose 3.75 cents a gallon to 5.5 cents a
gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 12:00 p.m., according to Bloomberg data. It was the highest
level since Aug. 3.  Valero’s Corpus Christi refineries in Texas reported
flaring, notices yesterday from the county’s local emergency
planning committee show.  “There is some flaring due to work on some compressors at
the Quintana section of the Corpus Christi East Plant,”  Bill
Day , a San Antonio-based spokesman said by e-mail yesterday.  The work is ongoing, but we don’t expect a material impact
to production there, he said today.  RBOB  New York  Harbor held at a premium of 13 cents a gallon
versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
