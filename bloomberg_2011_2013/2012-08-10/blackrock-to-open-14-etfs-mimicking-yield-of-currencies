BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
provider of exchange-traded funds, is planning 14 ETFs to allow
clients to bet on currencies including the euro, the Australian
dollar and the Chinese  renminbi .  The ETFs include iShares Australian Dollar Cash Rate Fund,
iShares Chinese Offshore Renminbi Cash Rate Fund and iShares
Euro Cash Rate Fund, according to a filing yesterday by the New
York-based asset manager with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The funds will invest in a combination of short-term
money market securities denominated in U.S. dollars and spot
foreign exchange contracts to replicate the daily yield of a
currency.  BlackRock is seeking to appeal to investors who want to
benefit from rising foreign currencies while seeking liquidity.
Spot currency contracts are those that are generally required to
be settled in two business days.  BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, drew $23.5
billion into its iShares ETFs this year. Vanguard Group Inc.’s
ETFs have increased their market share this year as investors
flocked to its low-cost products. BlackRock’s U.S. market share
in the ETF business fell 1.4 percentage points to about 41
percent, compared with an increase of 1.7 percentage points for
Vanguard to 18 percent, according to a report by State Street
Global Advisors.  The new ETF filing was reported earlier today by Reuters.
Mark Lake, a spokesman for Blackrock, which manages $3.56
trillion in assets, declined to comment on the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
