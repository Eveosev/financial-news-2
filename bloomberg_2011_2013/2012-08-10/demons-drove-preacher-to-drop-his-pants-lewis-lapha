During America’s Great Awakening,
itinerant preacher James Davenport denounced establishment
ministers, foamed at the mouth while screaming sermons and
organized public burnings or “Bonfires of the Vanities.”  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  On March 7, 1743, preaching on a pier in  New London ,
Connecticut, he urged the crowd to bring forth and burn books by
inferior Christians, as well as their own sinfully luxurious
clothing items. As encouragement, Davenport took off his plush
breeches and added them to the pile.  A fed-up woman retrieved them, threw them in his face and
told him to get a grip. That broke the spiritual spell, and the
crowd quickly dispersed.  One observer noted that her actions came just in time, or
the preacher would have been “obliged to strut about bare-
arsed.” In July 1744, Davenport said he’d been possessed by
“demonic spirits,” and later settled down to become a pastor
in  New Jersey .  I spoke with Thomas Kidd, author of “God of Liberty: A
Religious History of the American Revolution,” on the following
topics:  1. Great Awakening  2. Religious Liberty  3. God as Providence  4. Threat of Tyranny  5. Civil Spirituality  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
