Asian  stocks  dropped, with the
regional benchmark index trimming the biggest weekly advance
since January, after companies including  Li & Fung (494)  Ltd. posted
lower profit and as  China  reported export growth slowed more
than economists’ expectations.  Agricultural Bank of China  Ltd. fell 1.6 percent, leading
Chinese creditors lower, after new loans last month came in less
than analysts expected. Li & Fung plunged by a record in Hong
Kong as reduced spending by U.S. and European shoppers drove
down core operating profit at the supplier to Wal-Mart Stores
Inc.  Trend Micro Inc. (4704)  slumped 9.1 percent in Tokyo after
earnings fell at the maker of anti-virus software.  “We could see further weakening in China’s exports,
damping the broader economy,” said Michiya Tomita, a Hong Kong-
based  fund manager  at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which
oversees $65 billion. “Investors will be adjusting their
expectations downwards.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.6 percent to 120.22 as
of 5:33 p.m. in Tokyo, with about three shares declining for
every two that rose. The gauge trimmed its weekly advance to 2.8
percent, the most since the period ended Jan. 20, amid
speculation China will do more to support growth and after
Germany backed a European Central Bank bond-buying plan.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slipped 1 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index and  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index 
both declined 0.7 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index lost
0.2 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index added 0.3 percent.  China Exports  China’s export growth was sluggish in July, raising the
odds the government will take more aggressive measures to
support growth after industrial output and retail sales data
yesterday missed estimates.  Outbound shipments increased 1 percent from a year earlier
and imports rose 4.7 percent, the customs bureau said in a
statement today in Beijing. The  trade surplus  was $25.1 billion
compared with $31.5 billion a year earlier. Export growth was
below all 32 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Chinese lenders dropped after data from the central bank
said the industry extended 540.1 billion  yuan  ($85 billion) of
new local-currency loans in July, compared with the median
estimate of 700 billion yuan in a Bloomberg News survey of 30
analysts.  Agricultural Bank of China, the nation’s third-largest
lender, fell 1.6 percent to HK$3.18.  Industrial & Commercial
Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s biggest lender by market value,
slid 1.5 percent to HK$4.51.  ‘Very Difficult’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent
today. The gauge rose less than 0.1 percent yesterday after
American jobless claims unexpectedly dropped in the week ended
Aug. 4.  Li & Fung tumbled 19 percent to HK$12.90, the biggest
decline since the stock listed in 1992, Brokerages including
HSBC Holdings Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG cut ratings on the
stock after the company reported first-half core operating
profit dropped 22 percent and Chief Executive Officer  Bruce
Rockowitz  said the economic environment is “very difficult.”  Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. dropped 3.7 percent to S$1.17 in
 Singapore . The shipping company lost $118 million in the second
quarter, more than double the $41.1 million average loss
estimate of five analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Trend Micro tumbled 9.1 percent to 2,200 yen in Tokyo after
saying operating profit fell 20 percent to 10.5 billion yen
($134 million) in the six months ended June 30, hurt by falling
sales from the Americas and Europe.  ’Disaster Avoided’  Of the 385 companies that have reported  earnings  on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index since July 1 for which Bloomberg has
compiled analysts’ projections, 55 percent have missed estimates.  “While disaster has been avoided in Europe on the back of
the ECB’s actions, earnings will remain weak, reflecting a soft
patch in the global economy,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based
head of dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.,
which manages about $100 billion. “Markets have resumed an
uptrend but it won’t be without volatility.”  Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. sank 9.1 percent to A$2.91 in Sydney.
The stock was downgraded by Credit Suisse Group AG, UBS AG and
Citigroup Inc. after Australia’s largest racecourse betting
company provided estimates for wagering profit that were lower
than analyst expectations.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  has fallen 6.2 percent from
this year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern
China’s economic slowdown is deepening and Europe will struggle
to contain the debt crisis. Shares on the gauge were valued at
12.4 times estimated earnings, compared with 13.6 for the  S&P
500 Index  and 11.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
