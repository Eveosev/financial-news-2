Oil pared a weekly gain, dropping as
much as 0.5 percent in New York, as a collapse in China’s export
growth added to signs the global economy is weakening.  Futures for September delivery declined 42 cents to $92.94
a barrel in electronic trade on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:08 p.m. in  Singapore , paring the week’s advance to 1.7
percent.  China’s outbound shipments increased 1 percent in July from
a year earlier, the customs bureau said in a statement today in
Beijing. That compares with the 8 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts and 11.3 percent in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
