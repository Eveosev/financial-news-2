Japanese  stocks  fell for the first
time in five days, paring the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average’s biggest
weekly gain since February, as companies including  Trend Micro (4704) 
Inc. reported lower earnings. Shares extended declines after
 China ’s trade expanded less than economists expected.  Trend Micro sank 9.1 percent after earnings fell at the
maker of anti-virus software. Advantest Corp., a manufacturer of
memory-chip testers that gets more than 20 percent of its sales
in China, slid 1.2 percent.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that
depends on Europe for almost a third of revenue, fell 2.4
percent as the euro weakened. DeNA Co. soared 22 percent after
the social gaming company’s operating profit beat estimates.  “Investors are selling shares to lock in profit from this
week’s gain,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , chief  fund manager  at
Shinkin Asset Management Co. in  Tokyo ., which oversees about
$6.7 billion. “Earnings at domestic-demand focused companies
aren’t bad, but those depending on external demand are being
hurt by the yen’s appreciation and European debt problems.”  The Nikkei 225 fell 1 percent to 8,891.44 at the 3 p.m.
close, trimming its weekly gain to 3.9 percent. Traders earlier
settled the price of August options on the gauge at 8.914.81,
also known as the “special quotation.” The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index
lost 0.7 percent to 746.79, with almost three shares dropping
for every two that gained.  Shares extended drops after China’s exports rose 1 percent
in July from a year earlier, missing estimates for an 8 percent
gain, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Imports
increased 4.7 percent, compared with expectations for a 7
percent rise. The trade surplus of $25.15 billion fell short of
the $35.1 billion economists projected.  China Expectations  “We could see further weakening in China’s exports, damping
the broader economy” said Michiya Tomita, a Hong Kong-based
fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which
oversees $65 billion. “Investors will be adjusting their
expectations downwards.”  Advantest slid 1.2 percent to 1,068 yen.  Juki (6762)  Corp., a
sewing-machine maker that counts China as its biggest market,
slipped 1.8 percent to 111 yen.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.3 percent
today. The gauge rose less than 0.1 percent yesterday after
jobless claims unexpectedly dropped by 6,000 to 361,000 in the
week ended Aug. 4. The median forecast of 43 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for an increase to 370,000.  The Topix has fallen 14 percent from this year’s peak on
March 27 as growth slows in the U.S. and China and on concern
Europe’s debt crisis is spreading. The price of shares on the
gauge stood at 0.7 times book value, compared with 2.2 times for
the S&P 500 and 1.5 times for the  Europe  Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than value of their assets.  Earnings Season  A third of the Topix’s 1,672 companies are scheduled to
release earnings this week. Of the 316 companies that have
 reported  since July 1 that have issued forecasts, 52 percent
have missed expectations, according to Bloomberg data.  Trend Micro tumbled 9.1 percent to 2,200 yen, the most on
the Nikkei 225, after operating profit fell 20 percent to 10.5
billion yen ($134 million) in the six months ended June 30, hurt
by falling sales from the Americas and Europe.  Exporters to Europe slid after the shared currency fell to
as low as 96.33 yen last night in Tokyo, compared with 97.11 at
the close of  stock trading  yesterday. A weaker euro cuts the
value of some income for Japan’s exporters.  “Investors won’t become bullish until the  currency market 
settles down,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Canon Drops  Canon fell 2.4 percent to 2,658 yen. Hello Kitty creator
Sanrio Co., which gets almost a fifth of its sales from Europe,
slid 1.1 percent to 2,513 yen. Shimano Inc., a bicycle parts
manufacturer that gets 36 percent of its sales in the region,
sank 2.1 percent to 5,550 yen after its equity rating was cut to
neutral from neutral plus at Iwai Cosmo Securities Co.  DeNA, which generates all of its revenue in Japan, soared
22 percent to 2,210 yen, the most on record, after posting
first-quarter operating profit of 18.4 billion yen yesterday,
beating the 17.6 billion-yen estimate compiled by Bloomberg.
