Many banks aren’t passing on the
European Central Bank’s interest rate cut to their customers by
reducing overdraft charges,  Bild  reported today, citing a survey
by financial consultancy  FMH .  Most of the 27 banks in the survey lowered the interest
rates they offer on  savings accounts  while keeping rates on
overdrafts unchanged, even though it’s cheaper for banks to
borrow money following the ECB rate cut, the newspaper says,
citing the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
