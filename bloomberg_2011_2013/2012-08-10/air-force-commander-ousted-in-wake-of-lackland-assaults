The  Air Force  has removed the top
commander of basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in  San
Antonio , Texas, as it investigates 15 military instructors for
alleged sexual misconduct with trainees.  Colonel Glenn Palmer, who oversaw all basic training of
enlisted Air Force recruits, was relieved of command today, said
Collen McGee, a spokeswoman for the 37th Training Wing at
Lackland.  “There’s no wrongdoing on Colonel Palmer’s part,” McGee
said in an interview. “It’s a lack of confidence in his ability
to maintain safe training for airmen.”  Palmer’s boss, Colonel Eric Axelbank, commander of the 37th
Training Wing, “decided it was time that new leadership was
needed,” McGee said.  The Air Force has been investigating 15 military
instructors at the  Texas  base for alleged sexual misconduct
involving at least 38 victims.  Six of the instructors have been charged with crimes
ranging from improper sexual advances to rape. The others are
being investigated for allegations of sexual contact, non-
physical contact through social media and, in at least two
cases, some form of sexual assault.  One instructor, Staff Sergeant Luis Walker, was sentenced
to 20 years in prison on July 21 for crimes including rape,
adultery, obstruction of justice and aggravated sexual assault.  Lackland, one of the military’s busiest training centers,
provides basic training to all Air Force enlisted recruits.
About 500 instructors train 35,000 cadets annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
