OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest
savings bank, apologized to the country’s pensioners after an
employee posted “an inappropriate joke” on its microblog.  Deputy Chairman Bella Zlatkis apologized in writing to the
head of the Union of Pensioners for any offense, Sberbank said
today in an e-mailed statement. The bank fired the employee and
is taking steps to prevent such acts in the future, it said.  The tweet was that if someone wrote Sberbank in chalk on a
wall, a line of 30 pensioners would form,  Izvestia  newspaper
reported yesterday.  Sberbank held 47 percent of the nation’s deposits at the
end of last year and serves as a distribution agent of Russia’s
pensions, using its network of more than 19,000 outlets across
the country. More than 40.3 million people above the  retirement
age , Citigroup Inc. said in a report dated July 25.  “Sberbank has always cherished our most devoted and most
loyal customers -- pensioners,” Zlatkis said.  Sberbank will
always be “very respectful and responsive to first and foremost
the interests of the older generation,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
