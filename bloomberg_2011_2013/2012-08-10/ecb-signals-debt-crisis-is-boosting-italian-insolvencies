Fallout from the euro region’s debt
crisis has led to more corporate insolvencies in  Italy  than in
countries in northern Europe, the  European Central Bank  said in
its monthly report.  Corporate defaults increased “substantially” in the
second half of 2011 as the crisis intensified, compounding the
effects of weakening economic growth, the Frankfurt-based ECB
said in an article on risk to private companies from the debt
crisis published in yesterday’s monthly bulletin.  “Across the larger euro-area countries, this rise was
particularly pronounced for Italian firms, while it was rather
subdued for Dutch and German firms,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
