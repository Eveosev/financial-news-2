The U.S. women’s 400-meter relay
team broke a 27-year-old world record at the London Games, while
American men lost an Olympic 1,600-meter relay for the first
time in 40 years.  The U.S. and  Spain  advanced to their second straight
Olympic men’s basketball final yesterday as the Americans
extended their lead in the medal standings.  Tianna Madison, 200-meter champion Allyson Felix, Bianca
Knight and Carmelita Jeter ran a time of 40.82 seconds in
winning the 400-meter relay at the Olympic Stadium. The previous
mark of 41.37 was set by East Germany in 1985.  “We knew we could do it,” Felix said. “I was thinking
Olympic record and when I saw the time, I said, ‘Oh my gosh,
world record.’”  Jamaica, with two-time 100-meter gold medalist Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce running the first leg, finished second in 41.41
seconds. Ukraine won bronze in 42.04. The Jamaican and Ukrainian
teams set national records.  It was the second gold of the day for the U.S. after Jordan
Burroughs won the men’s 74-kilogram freestyle wrestling title by
defeating Sadegh Saeed Goudarzi of  Iran  in the final. The
Americans lead the standings with 41 golds and 94 medals in
total;  China  is second with 37 golds among its 81 medals.  Gold medals will be awarded in 32 events on the next-to-
last day of competition today. The U.S. meets France in the
women’s basketball gold-medal game, while  Brazil  seeks its first
Olympic men’s soccer title when it plays  Mexico  in the final.  Relay Loss  In the men’s 1,600-meter relay last night, the Bahamas won
gold to become the first nation to defeat the U.S. at that
distance in the Olympics since the 1972 Munich Games.  Ramon Miller caught Angelo Taylor down the stretch as the
Bahamas won in a national-record time of 2:56.72. The Americans
took silver in 2:57.05 and  Trinidad & Tobago  was third.  “It’s amazing,” said Demetrius Pinder, who ran the second
leg for Bahamas. “We made it good from the start. We finally
got it over the U.S.”  The U.S. was two-time defending champion in that relay. The
Americans also won in 2000, only to have their gold medals
stripped when relay member Antonio Pettigrew admitted he had
been using performance-enhancing substances at the time.  American teams won that relay in the previous four Olympics
as well.  Russia  triumphed at the 1980 Moscow Games boycotted by
the U.S., and Americans won in 1976. The U.S. was shut out of
the medals in 1972, when Kenya took gold.  Men’s Basketball  In men’s basketball,  Kevin Durant  of the  National
Basketball Association ’s Oklahoma City Thunder scored 19 points
to lead the defending champion U.S. to a 109-83 semifinal win
against Argentina, while Spain rallied from an 11-point halftime
deficit to beat Russia 67-59.  The U.S. will be seeking its 14th men’s basketball gold
tomorrow. The Americans beat Spain 118-107 four years ago for
the title in Beijing.  Meseret Defar of  Ethiopia  won her second women’s 5,000-
meter title yesterday. Asli Cakir Alptekin and Gamze Bulut had a
1-2 finish for  Turkey  in the women’s 1,500 meters. Maryam Yusuf
Jamal, 27, of  Bahrain  won bronze.  Two Olympic records fell as Russia’s Tatyana Lysenko won
the women’s hammer throw with a toss of 78.18 meters (256 feet,
6 inches) and Renaud Lavillenie of  France  took the men’s pole
vault at 5.97 meters.  Tunisia’s Oussama Mellouli won the men’s 10-kilometer
swimming marathon, becoming the first person to win medals in
the pool and open water at the same Olympics. The 28-year-old
took the bronze medal in the 1,500-meter freestyle on Aug. 4.  “This is probably one of the toughest things to do,”
Mellouli said. “In the 1,500 meters I went for it and I came
out with a bronze. Today I left it all out there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
