A smaller U.S. corn crop caused by
drought in the Midwest doesn’t justify calls for the Obama
Administration to suspend the country’s ethanol program, the
Renewable Fuels Association said.  Refiners can meet biofuel targets by drawing from ample
stockpiles and utilizing excess credits, known as Renewable
Identification Numbers, that can be submitted in lieu of
physically blending a gallon of ethanol to meet the government’s
mandate under the  Renewable Fuel Standard , the Washington-based
trade association said in a statement today.  The U.S. Agriculture Department  estimated  today that the
corn crop will drop 13 percent to a six-year low after the
hottest July since 1936 scorched Midwest fields. That’s prompted
livestock producers, members of Congress from both political
parties in both chambers and the  United Nations  to call for a
temporary suspension.  “Given the abundance of RFS credits, ample ethanol stocks,
and various other flexibilities, obligated parties under the RFS
will have every opportunity to demonstrate compliance this
year,” the group wrote in an e-mailed statement.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 0.4 cent to
$2.63 a gallon at 10:01 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 19 percent this year.  Corn for December delivery sank 0.5 cent to $8.2325 a
bushel. Prices yesterday rose to a record $8.2375. One bushel
makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The  Renewable Fuels Association  estimates that there are
about 2.5 billion credits that refiners can use to meet their
obligations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
