Investors put $356 billion into U.S.
checking and savings accounts in the first six months of this
year, almost double the $188 billion they deposited into bond
mutual funds and exchanged-traded funds, according to TrimTabs
Investment Research.  Equity mutual funds and ETFs attracted $6 billion in net
deposits, Sausalito, California-based TrimTabs said in a
statement yesterday. Retail money-market funds lost $21.3
billion to withdrawals in the first half, according to the firm.  “People are risk-averse in a risky world and don’t trust
the powers that be to manage the economy and the markets,”
 Charles Biderman , chief executive officer of TrimTabs, said in a
telephone interview. “When that happens, you hunker down and
put money away for better times.”  Investors are largely avoiding equities even as stock
markets have rallied this year. The  MSCI ACWI Index (MXWD)  of global
stocks rose 7.9 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
increased 12 percent through yesterday.  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis has sent some investors into the perceived safety of
bonds.  Savers will return to investing in stocks when workers who
have been unemployed long-term get rehired and income and the
housing market improve, Biderman said.  Net deposits for mutual funds were based on data from the
ICI, and TrimTabs provided the money attracted by ETFs, Biderman
said. Net deposits into bank accounts were based on data from
the  Federal Reserve .  To contact the reporter on this story:
