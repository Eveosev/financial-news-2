Reduced congestion in Chinese and
Brazilian ports is cutting earnings for ships hauling raw
materials, according to RS Platou Economic Research.  About 5.4 percent of dry-bulk carriers are tied up at
ports, down from 7.5 percent in May, Herman Hildan, an analyst
at RS Platou Markets AS in Oslo, said in an e-mailed note today.
Congestion declined in Brazilian ports as exports shifted to
 Australia , and falling coastal trade helped clear out Chinese
harbors, he said. That’s cutting fleet utilization by 1 percent,
adding to a 0.5 to 1 percent reduction from lower grain output,
Platou estimates.  Without those two influences, the largest commodity
carriers would be earning $14,000 a day, Hildan said in the
note. Daily income for Capesizes fell 5.3 percent today to
$3,852, according to the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based
publisher of shipping costs. The Baltic Dry Index, a broader
measure of raw-materials shipping costs, declined for a 24th
day, falling 2 percent to 774, the lowest since March.  “Lower congestion adds to the dry bulk pain,” Hildan said
in the note.  Daily earnings for Panamaxes, which carry about half as
much cargo as Capesizes, fell for an 18th day, decreasing 1.2
percent to $6,483, according to the exchange. Supramaxes
declined 2.2 percent to $9,264, and Handysizes, the smallest
vessels tracked by the gauge, slid less than 1 percent to
$7,699, both the lowest since March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
