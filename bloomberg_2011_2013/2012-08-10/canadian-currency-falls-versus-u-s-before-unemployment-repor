Canada ’s currency fell against its
U.S. counterpart for the first time in six days as slower growth
in China damped investor optimism that the nation’s employment
market added jobs last month.  “Its kind of a wash with all the other commodity
currencies with the weak China data overnight,” Darcy Browne,
managing director of  capital markets  trading at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto, said in a telephone
interview.  Canada’s dollar, nicknamed the loonie, fell 0.3 percent to
99.41 cents per U.S. dollar at 7:55 a.m. in Toronto. It was the
biggest decline in more than two weeks. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.00594.  China’s exports increased 1 percent from a year earlier,
the customs bureau said today in Beijing, after an 11.3 percent
rise in June. New local-currency lending was 540.1 billion yuan
($85 billion), the central bank said, lower than all 30
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey, compared with 919.8
billion yuan in June.  Employment rose by 6,000 positions in July,  Statistics
Canada  is forecast to report today in Ottawa, and the jobless
rate was probably steady at 7.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
