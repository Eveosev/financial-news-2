A strike by workers on the  Buenos
Aires  subway system is in its seventh day after wage talks with
the city’s government and Metrovias SA, which operates the
railroads, failed, the union said on its  website .  The protest has left about 1 million commuters without
services on six subway lines and a railroad, leading to traffic
jams in the city’s main highways and avenues.  The statement by the trade union comes after worker
representatives, local government officials and company
executives met earlier today for talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
