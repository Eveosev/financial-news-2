Louisiana State University  dismissed
All-American cornerback and 2011 Heisman Trophy finalist Tyrann
Mathieu from its football team following a violation of the
squad’s rules.  Mathieu, 20, was let go three weeks before the start of his
junior season, the school said on its athletics website. It
didn’t say what rules were broken.  “This is a very difficult day for our team,” Tigers coach
Les Miles said today in a press conference. “We lose a quality
person, teammate and contributor to the program. However, with
that being said, we have a standard that our players are held to
and when that standard is not met, there are consequences.”  Last season Mathieu had two interceptions and recovered
five fumbles, two of which he turned into touchdowns. Nicknamed
the “Honey Badger,” he also returned two punts for touchdowns.  An All-American, he was named the  Southeastern Conference ’s
defensive player of the year and won the Chuck Bednarik Award,
given annually to the best defensive player in college football.
He finished fifth in voting for the Heisman Trophy, which was
awarded to Baylor University quarterback Robert Griffin III as
the sport’s best player.  LSU lost last season’s  Bowl Championship Series  title game
21-0 to conference-rival  Alabama . The Tigers received the No. 1
rank in the USA Today preseason poll, and open their season on
Sept. 1 at home against North Texas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
