51job Inc. (JOBS)  gained the most in 22
months in  New York  as the Shanghai-based recruiting service
provider’s forecast for third-quarter sales was better than
expected and second-quarter profit topped estimates.  American depositary receipts of 51job surged 15 percent to
$41.90 at 12:12 p.m. in New York, poised for the largest advance
since Oct. 13, 2010. Trading volume was twice the stock’s three-
month daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  51job said second-quarter adjusted net income was 66 cents
per American depositary share on $56.7 million in sales, beating
the estimate of one analyst surveyed by Bloomberg. The company’s
third-quarter profit forecast was 66 cents per share on sales of
as much as $58.2 million.  “Expectations about the second quarter were so low that
investors were pleased that the company’s reassuring outlook
suggests their market is stable and hasn’t deteriorated,” Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at Oberweis Asset Management Inc., which
manages $700 million and holds shares in 51job, said yesterday
by phone from Lisle,  Illinois . “51job’s competitive position
continues to improve as they’re probably gaining some market
share in the downturn.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
