Senior debt holders in Spanish banks
that aren’t viable may risk losses as the European bailout of
the nation’s lenders seeks to limit the cost to taxpayers,  Fitch
Ratings  said.  While the rescue agreement “does not explicitly impose
burden-sharing on senior debt holders,” the terms “could be
interpreted as implicitly suggesting that senior debt holders
could face potential losses in the case of ultimately non-viable
banks,” Fitch said today in a statement from  London .  Spain  sought the 100 billion-euro ($124 billion) rescue on
June 9 for banks reeling from real-estate losses five years
after the property bubble burst. The  European Central Bank  would
no longer oppose the imposition of losses on senior bondholders
if the bank in question is being wound down, two officials with
knowledge of the ECB’s thinking said on July 16.  The ECB’s position has evolved since it opposed forcing
losses on the senior creditors of Irish banks after the
government started injecting capital into the lenders in 2009.
At the time, the ECB argued that reneging on senior Irish bank
debt would damage financial stability in the euro area.  Fitch also said it is “cautious” as to whether the
bailout will be the “final reform of the Spanish banking
sector.” Banks that have already been taken over by the state,
including Bankia group, are set to be the first to receive
European funds, the Spanish government has said. No date has
been set for the first disbursement from the rescue package.  To contact the reporter on this story:
