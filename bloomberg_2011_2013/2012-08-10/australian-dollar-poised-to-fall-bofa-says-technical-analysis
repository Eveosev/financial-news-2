The two-month rally by Australia’s
dollar against its U.S. counterpart may end as the Aussie
approaches the limits of its trading range over the past year,
according to Bank of America Corp.  The Australian currency may top out between $1.0584 and
$1.0857 to the dollar,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange
and interest-rates technical strategy in  New York  at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, wrote today in a client note. The
appreciation would “ideally” climax at $1.0584 to $1.0697,
corresponding to a 78.6 percent retracement of the decline from
February to June and would contact the currency pair’s range
resistance, he wrote.  “We’ve been in a range for the past year, and we’re coming
to the high end of that range,” Curry said in a telephone
interview. “It’s not so much a line in the sand as a trading
range.”  If the currency breaches the $1.0436 level, it may fall to
98 U.S. cents to 96.29 cents, he said.  “We’ve gotten to the range high, now we want to look go to
the range low,” Curry said.  The Aussie depreciated 0.1 percent to $1.0570 today in New
York. The currency gained against all of its 16 most-traded
peers over the past year.  Resistance is an area on a chart where sell orders may be
clustered. In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study
charts of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
