Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Following two months of little change, employment in July
declined by 30,000, the result of losses in part-time work. The
unemployment rate rose 0.1 percentage points to 7.3%.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased 0.8%
or 139,000, with full-time employment up 1.4% while part-time
employment declined 1.8%. Total number of hours worked increased
1.2% over the same period.  Employment losses in July were in wholesale and retail
trade; professional, scientific and technical services; public
administration; and natural resources. These losses were partly
offset by gains in information, culture and recreation as well
as in finance, insurance, real estate and leasing.  In July, employment declined in  Quebec , British Columbia,
Manitoba as well as in Newfoundland and Labrador, while it
increased in Prince  Edward Island . There was little change in
the other provinces.  Losses were concentrated among women aged 55 and over,
while employment was virtually unchanged among the other major
demographic groups.  There was little change in employment in both the public
and private sectors in July. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment in the public sector increased by 2.1%, while private
sector employees and self-employment were little changed.  Industry perspective  Employment in wholesale and retail trade decreased by
30,000 in July. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in
this sector has fallen by 88,000 (-3.3%).  In July, employment in professional, scientific and
technical services declined by 22,000, continuing its downward
trend that started in January. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment was little changed in this sector, as the recent
declines were offset by gains in the first five months of this
period.  Employment in public administration fell by 17,000 in July.
Employment in this sector remained similar to 12 months earlier.  Employment in natural resources declined by 8,900 in July,
following two months of little change. Nonetheless, this sector
continued to have the highest year-over-year growth rate of all
major industries at 11.4%.  In July, employment rose by 24,000 in information, culture
and recreation, following declines in the previous three months.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in this sector
remained little changed.  Employment in finance, insurance, real estate and leasing
increased by 19,000 in July, continuing an upward trend that
started in February. These gains offset declines in the previous
five months, leaving employment in July similar to that of 12
months earlier.  Manufacturing was little changed in July, following gains
earlier in the year. Compared with 12 months earlier, the number
of factory workers was up slightly.  Provincial summary  Employment in Quebec fell by 29,000 in July, all in part-
time work, leaving employment at similar levels to July 2011.
The  unemployment rate  for the month was 7.6%.  Following two months of little change, employment in
British Columbia declined by 15,000 in July, pushing the
unemployment rate up 0.4 percentage points to 7.0%. With gains
made prior to May, employment in this province was 1.5% higher
compared with 12 months earlier.  In July, employment in Manitoba declined by 3,300 and the
unemployment rate increased by 0.5 percentage points to 5.7%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment was little changed.  Employment in Newfoundland and Labrador was down 3,200 in
July, leaving employment at a similar level as July 2011.  Following gains in June, employment in Ontario was little
changed in July. The unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage
points to 7.9%, as more people searched for work. Year-over-year
employment gains totalled 47,000 (+0.7%).  Despite little change in employment for the second
consecutive month, Alberta continued to have the lowest
unemployment rate among all the provinces at 4.6%. With gains
made throughout most of the previous 12 months, employment in
this province has increased by 2.2% since July 2011, the highest
growth rate of all provinces.  Employment declines among women aged 55 and over  Following three months of little change, employment among
women aged 55 and over fell by 30,000 in July. Nevertheless,
compared with 12 months earlier employment among this group was
up by 45,000 (+3.2%).  Despite little change for men aged 55 and over in July,
their employment was up 72,000 (+4.3%) compared with 12 months
earlier.  The year-over-year employment increase for both men and
women aged 55 and over was mostly a result of population aging.  Employment among those aged 25 to 54 was virtually
unchanged in July. Employment growth for this group over the
previous 12 months totalled 74,000 (+0.6%).  Employment among youths was little changed in July, and was
down by 52,000 (-2.1%) compared with 12 months earlier. Their
unemployment rate declined by 0.5 percentage points to 14.3% in
July, as fewer of them searched for work.  Student summer employment  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects labour
market information about young people aged 15 to 24 who were
attending school full time in March and intend to return to
school full time in the fall. The published estimates are not
seasonally adjusted; therefore, comparisons can only be made on
a year-over-year basis.  The rate of employment among students aged 20 to 24, that
is, the number of employed as a percentage of their population,
was 70.4% in July, little changed from the previous two years,
but up from 66.8% in July 2009, when student employment was hard
hit by the labour market downturn. The unemployment rate for
these students was 7.9% in July, similar to that of the previous
two years but down from 13.3% in July 2009.  Among students aged 17 to 19, the employment rate of 58.7%
in July has been essentially unchanged since July 2009. Their
unemployment rate, at 17.7%, has also been little changed since
July 2009.  The labour market for students aged 15 to 16 years
continued to be difficult in July. Their employment rate was
29.0%, the lowest on record. The unemployment rate for these
students was 31.2%, among the highest ever posted for this age
group.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will have
more variability. For an explanation of sampling variability of
estimates and how to use standard errors to assess this
variability, consult the “Data quality” section of the
publication Labour Force Information (71-001-X, free).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G,
free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by removing the
effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal
adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying economic
trends ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/2010003/part -
partie3-eng.htm) .  Educational services  The LFS seasonal adjustment process removes typical
seasonal patterns in the monthly data, according to trends
established in previous years. While there have been larger
movements in educational services employment in summer months in
recent years, there has not been a consistent pattern in the
magnitude or direction of these changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
