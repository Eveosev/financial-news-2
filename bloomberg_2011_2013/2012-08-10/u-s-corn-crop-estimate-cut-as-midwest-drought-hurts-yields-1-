Corn production in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower and exporter, will drop 13 percent to a
six-year low after the hottest July since 1936 damaged Midwest
fields, the government said.  The harvest will total 10.779 billion bushels (273.8
million metric tons), compared with 12.358 billion in 2011, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in its first survey-
based  estimate  for the crop. Last month, the USDA said
production would fall to 12.97 billion. The average prediction
of 29 analysts questioned by Bloomberg was for 10.929 billion.  Crop  conditions  on Aug. 5 were the worst since 1988, and 69
percent of the Midwest this week had moderate to exceptional
drought, government data show. Corn prices through yesterday had
surged 63 percent since mid-June, reaching an all-time high
today of $8.49 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
contract for December delivery erased those gains, closing down
1.8 percent at $8.0925 as of 2 p.m. on demand concerns.  “The U.S. drought means that global corn supplies will be
critically tight for the next year,” William Tierney, the chief
economist for Chicago-based AgResource Co., said before the
report. “Livestock and milk-product prices will have to rise to
cover the increased feed costs. Eventually, global consumers
will have to pay the bill.”  Dry weather in  Russia  and below-average monsoon rains in
 India  are also threatening world grain supplies. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. is among the banks forecasting corn prices will keep
rising, and the  United Nations  reported yesterday the biggest
gain in global  food  costs since 2009. World cereal prices surged
17 percent in July, the most since February 2008, the UN’s  Food
and Agriculture Organization  said.  Increased Costs  Smaller supplies of corn may increase costs for ethanol
refiners such as  Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM)  and  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO)  and meat producers  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and  Smithfield Foods
Inc. (SFD) , which buy the grain for feed. Cargill Inc. cited lower
beef-profit margins as contributing to an 82 percent drop in
quarterly earnings.  July’s average temperature, at 77.6 degrees Fahrenheit
(25.3 Celsius), was the highest for the contiguous U.S. states
since July 1936, and the past year was the warmest 12 months
since modern temperature-data collection began 118 years ago,
according to the National Climatic Data Center.  About 50 percent of the corn fields in the U.S. were in
poor or very poor condition as of Aug. 5, the worst for that
date since 1988 when production fell 31 percent from a year
earlier, government data show.  ‘Salvaging Crops’  “Some crops were written off as unproductive several weeks
ago and others are seemingly hanging by a thread,” Roger Elmore, an agronomist at  Iowa State University  in Ames, said in
a report last week. “Some producers are salvaging what
remains” for cattle and dairy-cow feed, Elmore said.  Yields will average 123.4 bushels per acre, down from 146
bushels estimated in July and less than 147.2 bushels last year,
the USDA said. Yields are forecast to fall to the lowest since
1995.  Unsold supplies of U.S. corn on Aug. 31, 2013, before next
year’s harvest, will total 650 million bushels, compared with
1.183 billion forecast in July and 1.021 billion estimated this
year, the USDA said. Traders surveyed by Bloomberg expected
reserves to fall to 629 million, on average.  World Output  World output in the crop year that begins Oct. 1 will be
849.01 million tons, down from 905.23 million forecast a month
ago and from 876.84 million last year, the USDA said.  China , the second-biggest producer and consumer, will
harvest 200 million tons, up from 195 million estimated in July
and up from 192.78 million this year. China’s imports were
forecast at 2 million, down from 5 million estimated in July and
5 million this year.  Global consumption is forecast to fall for the first time
since 1996 to 861.64 million tons, from 900.51 million tons
projected in July and 868.35 million this year.  Worldwide inventories at the end of the next marketing year
will be 123.33 million tons, down from 134.09 million predicted
a month ago, and 135.97 million expected this year, the USDA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
