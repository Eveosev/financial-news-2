Pictet & Cie.,  Switzerland ’s largest
closely held private bank, said client assets under management
increased by 8.5 percent in the first half of the year.  Assets under management rose to 268 billion francs ($274
billion) at the end of June, from 247 billion francs six months
earlier, with most of the gain coming in the first quarter, an
official at the Geneva-based bank said by phone today.  Pictet, established in 1805, is Switzerland’s third-largest
wealth manager after UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG. The
company declined to provide figures for net new money during the
period.  Total client assets, including those held in custody,
climbed to 357 billion francs from 336.3 billion francs at the
end of December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
