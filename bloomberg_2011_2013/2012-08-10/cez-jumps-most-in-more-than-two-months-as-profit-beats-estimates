CEZ AS (CEZ)  jumped the most since May
after the biggest Czech power utility said its profit almost
doubled, exceeding all estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The stock increased 1.9 percent to 738 koruna by the close
in Prague, its biggest one-day advance since May 30 and the best
performance today in the 14-member  PX (PX)  stock index.  Net income for April to June climbed to 12.9 billion koruna
($628 million) from 6.74 billion koruna a year earlier, CEZ said
today, citing a past-due payment from Romania’s state railways,
gains from currency swings and increased power generation. The
median projection of 14 analysts polled by Bloomberg was 7.58
billion koruna, and the highest estimate 10.1 billion koruna.  “The numbers look very strong,” Petr Bartek, an analyst
at Ceska Sporitelna AS in  Prague , wrote in an e-mailed report
today. He has an accumulate recommendation for CEZ shares with a
price estimate of 902 koruna, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
