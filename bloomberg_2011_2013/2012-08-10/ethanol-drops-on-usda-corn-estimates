Ethanol futures fell for the first
time in three days after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
trimmed its demand estimate on speculation record corn prices
will curb consumption of the grain.  Futures followed corn lower after the USDA forecast corn
demand will shrink 10 percent from a year earlier as a drought
spurs prices. The agency estimated ethanol plants will consume
4.5 billion bushels of corn, down from 5 billion in a previous
report. One bushel of the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  “Ethanol was thin today with many participants sitting on
the sidelines waiting to see how corn would react,”  Ian Jackson 
and Ronnie Virissimo, traders at SCB & Associates in Chicago,
wrote in an e-mail.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 1.7 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.609 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 18 percent this year.  Analysts and traders braced for the USDA to make steeper
cuts to its forecast after the worst drought in 56 years
blanketed the corn-rich Midwest, according to Jerrod Kitt, an
analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.  “There’s was nothing too bearish,” Kitt said. “Just that
you didn’t get the absolute worst-case scenario.”  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.65 a gallon, in  Chicago  at $2.59, in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.64 and on the West Coast at $2.785, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Corn for December delivery sank 14.5 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to $8.0925 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
