Gafisa SA (GFSA3) , the worst-performing
Brazilian homebuilder in the past twelve months, rose the most
on the benchmark Bovespa index after reporting a surprise profit
in the second quarter.  Shares added 7.1 percent to 3.33 reais at 12:48 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, pushing the five-day gain to 16 percent, the most since
the week ended June 15. The Bovespa rose 0.2 percent.  Adjusted net income fell 9.6 percent to 22.7 million reais
($11.3 million) in the three months through June, Gafisa said in
a regulatory filing. Analysts had expected an adjusted net loss
of 21.2 million reais, according to the average of eight
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Gafisa sent an important sign to the market with this
cash generation, withdrawing the possibility of lack of
liquidity,” Rodolfo Amstalden, an analyst at equity consulting
firm Empiricus  Research, wrote in a note to clients dated
today.  Gafisa has lost 51 percent in the past twelve months while
the BM&FBovespa Real Estate index advanced 7.9 percent during
that period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
