Ethanol production would fall if
corn prices were to reach and stay above $10 a bushel,
justifying the U.S. Agriculture Department’s estimates, Morgan
Stanley said.  The department today reduced its forecast for corn used for
ethanol by 8.2 percent to 4.5 billion bushels from a July
estimate, because of record corn prices caused by the worst U.S.
drought since the Eisenhower administration.  “The USDA’s 400 million-bushel month-over-month cut to
ethanol demand is surprisingly large, however, and we contend
that ethanol demand rationing of that magnitude will need
sustained corn prices above $10 a bushel,” Morgan Stanley
analysts including  Hussein Allidina  and Bennett Meier wrote in
an e-mailed report today.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 0.1 cent to
$2.625 a gallon at 12:16 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 19 percent this year.  Corn for December delivery sank 7 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$8.1675 a bushel. Prices yesterday rose to a record $8.2375. One
bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  About 42 percent of the corn crop will be used for biofuel
production.  Ethanol  production  has fallen 15 percent to 817,000 barrels
a day in the week ended Aug. 3 from a record in December.
Stockpiles sank 3.9 percent to 18.7 million barrels last week,
the biggest decline since Dec. 9 and the lowest level since Jan.
6, Energy Department data show.  Yesterday, East Kansas Agri-Energy LLC, an ethanol
producer, said it plans to stop output at its Garnett, Kansas,
plant on Oct. 1, because drought in the Midwest has made the
operation unprofitable.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest U.S. ethanol
producer, is operating its plants at about 50 percent of
capacity because of the higher corn prices, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Bill Klesse  said July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
