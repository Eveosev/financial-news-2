U.K. Coal Plc (UKC)  slumped to the lowest
since 1993 in London after reporting a first-half loss and plans
for a restructuring to split its mining and property business.  It fell as much as 23 percent to 5.74 pence after reporting
in a statement today a pretax loss of 20.6 million pounds ($32
million), following a 22.1 million pound profit a year earlier.  U.K. Coal said it made progress in restructuring the
business, with a non-binding agreement resulting in about 90
million pounds of support to the company through end-2015. The
plan would also seek to address the companyâ€™s funding deficit to
the pension fund of about 430 million pounds, it said.  Cash generated by the mines would go toward paying for its
pension deficit, Chairman Jonson Cox said on a conference call.
The stock fell 22 percent to 5.85 pence by 3:07 p.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
