Sharp Corp. (6753) ,  Japan ’s biggest liquid-
crystal panel maker, said it’s in talks with Foxconn Technology
Group to make its capital and business partnership agreement
formed in March “valid.”  Sharp will disclose any decision as soon as it’s reached,
the Osaka, Japan-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Foxconn, maker of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPads, said Aug. 3 it will
renegotiate the price of its investment in Sharp after the
Japanese TV maker widened its loss forecast eightfold.  Shares in the maker of Aquos TVs have plunged 62 percent
compared with the planned purchase price of 550 yen, prompting
the Taiwanese company to review its purchase price. Foxconn said
in March it agreed to buy 9.9 percent of the Osaka-based company
for 67 billion yen ($854 million).  Taiwan’s Investment Commission sent the original
application back to Foxconn, asking for more information on the
group’s forecast for profit from the deal, it said yesterday.
The regulator and Foxconn were unable to provide details on the
expected return.  Foxconn plans to invest in Sharp through its two Taipei
listed units,  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317) , the world’s
largest contract manufacturer of electronics, and  Foxconn
Technology Co. (2354) , a maker of computer cases.  Sharp surged 9.4 percent, the biggest gain since March 28,
to 209 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
