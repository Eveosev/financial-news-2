Fuel stockpiles in  Europe  were below
the five-year average in June on lower refinery runs,
particularly in Germany and the Netherlands, according to the
 International Energy Agency .  The commercial inventories, which now include Estonia and
Slovenia, dropped by 9.6 million barrels to 919 million barrels
“amid continuing weak refinery throughputs which necessitated
products destocking to meet demand,” the Paris-based agency
said today in its monthly  report .  Germany’s supplies fell the most, by 5.1 million barrels,
because refinery output remained “depressed,” the IEA said.
That was followed by decreases in the Netherlands and Italy, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
