Treasuries rose for the first time
in six days as a collapse in  China ’s export growth added to
signs the global economy is weakening and pushed investors
toward safer assets.  Treasuries were poised for a third weekly decline, with the
10-year note yield reaching the highest since May 30. Benchmark
 10-year yields  climbed above the rate of inflation yesterday,
luring investors seeking so-called positive real yields. China’s
exports increased 1 percent in July from the year before, versus
11.3 percent in June, while French industrial output stagnated,
reports today showed. The U.S. government’s budget deficit
narrowed more than forecast in July.  “The main concern is the data out of China,” said Michael Pond, co-head of interest-rate strategy in New York at Barclays
Plc, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal
Reserve . “Risk assets have come under pressure overnight and
hence investors are pushing into Treasuries.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  dropped three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.66 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent
note due in August 2022 rose 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 22/32. The yield has increased nine basis points
this week.  Real Yields  The 10-year yield climbed as high as 1.73 percent
yesterday, surpassing the 1.7 percent level of U.S. consumer-
price increases.  U.S. consumer-price inflation slowed to 1.5 percent in July
from a year earlier, versus June’s 1.7 percent reading,
according to a Bloomberg survey before the Labor Department
report on Aug. 15. The figure would translate into a real yield
of 15 basis points, based on today’s 10-year rate. It was
negative 2.11 percentage points in October.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
expectations for consumer prices during the life of the debt,
was 2.27 percentage points. The average during the past decade
is 2.16 percentage points.  Corporate bonds outperformed government debt as investors
sought higher yields.  U.S. government securities have returned 1.9 percent this
year as of yesterday, versus 7.7 percent for an index of
investment-grade and high-yield company debt, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch data. The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) 
of stocks handed investors a 10 percent gain including
reinvested dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fed Expectations  “The market’s anticipating there’s going to be some sort
of accommodation from the Fed,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-
rate strategist BNP Paribas SA in New York, a primary dealer.
“Equities have done extremely well, corporate credit is doing
extremely well. Almost all sectors of the market are just
roaring.”  The 10-year yield may extend declines to test its 55-day
moving average of 1.57 percent, according to Commerzbank AG.  “It is even possible that the 1.44 percent current August
low and the 1.435 percent June trough are to be revisited before
the yield rises in earnest,” technical analysts including  Karen Jones  at Commerzbank in  London , wrote in a note.  The economy added 163,000 jobs in July, a government report
showed Aug. 3, more than the 100,000 projected by economists.
Initial claims for  unemployment insurance  unexpectedly dropped
by 6,000 to 361,000 last week, a report showed yesterday.  Debt Sales  Retail sales rose 0.3 percent in July snapping a three-
month string of declines, the Commerce Department in  Washington 
is expected to say Aug. 14, according to the median forecast of
45 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The three months of
declines is the longest such streak since the period from July
through December of 2008.  Demand waned at sales of three-, 10- and 30-year Treasuries
this week. The 10-year auction on Aug. 8 drew  bids  for 2.49
times the amount of debt available, dropping from 3.61 at the
prior sale on July 11.  “The auctions are going to be choppier and choppier all
the time, because the lower yields go, the less interest people
are going to have in them,” said  David Brownlee , head of fixed
income at Sentinel Asset Management in Montpelier,  Vermont ,
which manages $28 billion. “Really nothing’s changed to warrant
higher rates.”  Deficit Spending  The U.S. government’s budget deficit narrowed as spending
dropped by 11.9 percent from a year earlier and some payments
were accelerated to the previous month for calendar-related
reasons.  The gap shrank 46 percent to $69.6 billion from a $129.4
billion shortfall in July 2011, the Treasury Department said
today in Washington. Last month’s gap was smaller than the
projected $90 billion deficit, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey. For the first 10 months of this
fiscal year the deficit was 11.5 percent narrower than in the
year-earlier period.  The deficit  through July  for the 2012 fiscal year, which
ends Sept. 30, is $973.8 billion compared with $1.1 trillion at
this point last year and the lowest for July since 2008.  The Fed sold $7.8 billion of notes due from July 2013 to
January 2014 today, according to the  website  of its  New York 
branch. The sales are part of the central bank’s effort to
support the economy by swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its
holdings for longer-maturity ones to cap long-term borrowing
costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
