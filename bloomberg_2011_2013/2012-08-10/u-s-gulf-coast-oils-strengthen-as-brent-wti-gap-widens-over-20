U.S. Gulf Coast oils strengthened
after the discount for West Texas Intermediate to  Brent crude 
widened past $20 a barrel, the largest gap in four months.  The difference between the benchmarks widened 22 cents to
$20.08 at settlement in  New York  based on September prices. When
Brent rises at a faster pace than WTI, as it did today, that
typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades competing with
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
increased $2.35 to $18.60 a barrel at 2:06 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet
increased $2 to $19 over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium added $2.50 to $13.85, while Southern
Green Canyon increased $1.85 to $12.50 a barrel over WTI. Mars
Blend’s premium gained $2.60 to $14.10.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened $1.65 to $16.50.  Syncrude gained 75 cents to $5.25 a barrel over WTI.
Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like bitumen in
 Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed 55 cents to
$11.75 a barrel below WTI, the smallest gap since Dec. 5. Bakken
oil’s discount narrowed $1.25 to $1 a barrel below the U.S.
benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
