The cyber worm Gauss, designed to
steal sensitive data in the  Middle East , was found as experts
try to mitigate web risks following the discovery of the Flame
virus in May, Kaspersky Lab said.  Gauss, while similar to Flame, seems to have a different
target, Kaspersky said on its website. Gauss focuses on Lebanon,
its banks in particular, while Flame primarily infected
computers in  Iran , according to the Moscow-based information-
technology security company.  An analysis of the new malicious software shows it was
designed to steal data from Lebanese lenders including the  Bank
of Beirut (BOB) , BomBank and Byblos Bank, Kaspersky said. Gauss has
infected 2,500 machines, while Flame hit about 700.  “Similar to Flame and Duqu, another cyber-espionage
weapon, Gauss is a complex cyber-expionage toolkit, with its
design emphasizing stealth and secrecy,” Alexander Gostev,
Kaspersky’s chief security specialist, said in the statement.
“However its purpose is different. Gauss targets multiple users
in select countries to steal large amounts of data, with a
specific focus on banking and financial information.”  An official at  Byblos Bank (BYB) , speaking anonymously as she
wasn’t authorized to talk about the matter, said the Beirut-
based lender was aware of the issue. She declined to give
further information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
