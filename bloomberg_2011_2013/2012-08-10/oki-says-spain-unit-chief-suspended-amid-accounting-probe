Oki Electric Industry Co. (6703)  said it
suspended the chief executive of the group’s Spanish unit after
a probe signaled he may have overstated accounts.  An internal investigation showed the locally hired CEO
“committed alleged accounting irregularities, exaggerating the
number of receivables,” Tokyo-based Oki said on its Spanish
 website . Oki  Europe  has “full confidence” in the Madrid-based
unit’s management team, it said in an e-mailed statement. Phone
messages seeking comment at the home of the executive, Javier Toledo, weren’t returned.  Oki dropped the most since at least 1974 yesterday after
the maker of automated teller machines and communications
equipment said the Spanish unit had overstated accounts. As a
result, Oki will miss the mid-August deadline for submitting
financial reports for the period through June 30, prompting the
 Tokyo  stock exchange to put it on watch for possible delisting.
Oki  rose  12 percent today to 91 yen at the close in Tokyo.  Full-year earnings forecasts may be revised and Oki’s past
financial statements may be corrected after an outside panel
draws up a report, Oki President Hideichi Kawasaki told
reporters on Aug. 8.  Camera maker  Olympus Corp. (7733) , which last year admitted to
financial irregularities, was fined by the Tokyo exchange and
allowed to keep its listing after being put on the watchlist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
