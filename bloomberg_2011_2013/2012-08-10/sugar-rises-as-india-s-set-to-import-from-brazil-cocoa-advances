 Sugar rose in  London  on speculation
dry weather in  India  will cut output, forcing the world’s
second-largest producer and biggest consumer to import the
sweetener. Cocoa advanced.  Some 96,000 metric tons of raw sugar were scheduled to be
shipped to India from  Brazil  as of Aug. 8, according to Williams
Servicos Maritimos Ltda. India’s monsoon, which brings about 70
percent of annual rainfall, has been 17 percent below average
since June 1, the  India Meteorological Department  said. Sugar
output in the country may drop to 24 million tons in the season
starting in October, Sucden India Pvt said. That compares with
26 million tons in 2011-12, according to the Indian Sugar Mills
Association.  “The market may be turning its attention” to India,
Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said
by phone today. The decline in the last few weeks “was not
justified by fundamentals, given the weaker crop in India.”  White, or refined, sugar for October delivery gained 0.8
percent to $586.10 a ton by 11:10 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London,
having advanced as much as 1.3 percent earlier, this month’s
biggest intraday gain. Raw sugar for October delivery rose 1.3
percent to 21.06 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Brazilian sugar is heading to India as the economics for
refining and imports for domestic consumption “are beginning to
make sense,” Peter de Klerk, an analyst at Czarnikow Group
Ltd., said yesterday. The white sugar premium over the raw
sweetener rose 9.3 percent in the past month, increasing the
incentive to refine. Sugar futures on India’s National Commodity
& Derivatives Exchange rose 17 percent in the past month.  Cocoa for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to 1,674
pounds ($2,612) a ton on the NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for December
delivery was up 0.1 percent at $2,480 a ton on ICE.  Robusta coffee for September delivery advanced 0.4 percent
to $2,174 a ton in London. Arabica coffee for September delivery
rose 0.1 percent to $1.697 a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
