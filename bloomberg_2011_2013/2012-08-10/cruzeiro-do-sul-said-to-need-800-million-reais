Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA , the
Brazilian bank seized by the central bank, needs 800 million
reais ($397 million) in capital from a possible buyer, according
to a person with direct knowledge of the lender’s finances.  An audit of the bank’s books shows it may take writedowns
of about 2.5 billion reais, said the person, who asked not to be
named because the information hasn’t yet been released.  Cruzeiro was placed under the administration of the
privately owned deposit-insurance fund known as FGC on June 4
amid an investigation into possible accounting fraud. The fund
requested the audit and announced that it would seek a buyer for
the Sao Paulo-based company.  Negotiations with potential acquirers will begin only after
the fund releases audit results on Aug. 14, the person said. The
FGC would consider providing liquidity to the acquiring bank
once the transaction is complete, and won’t provide capital, the
person said.  Cruzeiro has  declined  about 77 percent since  Brazil ’s
central bank ordered the takeover on June 4, closing at 1.77
reais yesterday in  Sao Paulo .  The FGC audit found assets listed on Cruzeiro’s balance
sheet, valued at about 1.3 billion reais, that didn’t exist, the
person said. It also found improperly priced assets and the lack
of a provision for loan losses, the person said.  Officials at the bank and the FGC declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
