San Bernardino, the third California
city to seek  bankruptcy protection  since June, listed the
state’s Public Employees’ Retirement System as its biggest
unsecured creditor, owed about $143.3 million, according to a
bankruptcy court filing.  The city also asked the court to set a deadline of Sept. 21
for creditors to challenge San Bernardino’s eligibility to seek
bankruptcy protection. The court has scheduled Oct. 3 for a
status hearing on any objections it receives, while a first
hearing on the city’s bankruptcy case is yet to be held.  San Bernardino showed the amount owed to Calpers for its
unfunded pension costs in a filing of its 20 largest unsecured
creditors, which collectively are owed about $281.4 million. The
city also owes about $46.1 million on pension obligation bonds,
and $3.3 million is owed to Public Agency Retirement Services
of  Newport Beach , California, for unfunded pensions.  Unsecured debt related to pensions totaled about
$192.8 million, according to court documents.  San Bernardino filed for municipal bankruptcy Aug. 1 after
disclosing a $46 million shortfall in the city’s budget. The
city of 209,000 about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of  Los
Angeles , listed assets and debt of more than $1 billion in a
filing with the  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Riverside, California.  The case is In re San Bernardino, 12-28006, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Central District of California (Riverside).  To contact the reporters on this story:
