The German government wants to force
power grid operator TenneT Holding BV to quit the German market
because it does not invest enough in renewable energy,
Handelsblatt said, citing unidentified government officials.  A certification process being conducted by the Federal
Network Agency may be used as a lever to drive Tenet out of the
market, Handelsblatt said.  TenneT struggles to find money to expand investments in
off-shore grids that connect wind parks to the mainland,
Handelsblatt said. The German government wants to push renewable
energy as part of a strategy to strengthen energy independence
and turn off its nuclear power plants by 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
