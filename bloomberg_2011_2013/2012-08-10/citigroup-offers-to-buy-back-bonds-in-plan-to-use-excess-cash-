Citigroup Inc. (C)  is offering to buy
back outstanding bonds as the third-largest  U.S. bank  by assets
seeks to use surplus cash to reduce its debt load.  The buyback relates to notes with an aggregate principal
amount outstanding of about $12.4 billion and is part of the New
York-based bank’s “liability management strategy that utilizes
excess cash to retire generally older vintage debt,” according
to a statement distributed by  Business Wire . The offers are
subject to a cap on each of the seven series of bonds, and
expire at 11:59 p.m.  New York  time on Sept. 6.  Citigroup earlier this month said it would repurchase as
much as $500 million of notes denominated in Swiss francs and
pounds.  The securities in today’s tender offer include the bank’s
$1.75 billion of 5.125 percent bonds due 2014, its 6 percent
notes due 2017 and its 6.125 percent notes due 2018, according
to the statement.  The lender’s 8.5 percent debt due 2019, 5.85 percent bonds
due 2034, as well as $1 billion of 6.95 percent notes due 2018
sold by unit Associates Corp. are also included.  Citigroup is also offering to repurchase some of its $750
million of floating-rate notes due 2014, according to the
statement.  The amount of debt to be bought back is subject to a
maximum series tender cap, the bank said. If that cap is
reached, Citigroup will end up buying back some $675 million of
notes.  Apart from the floating-rate notes, which will be bought
back at a fixed price of 97.25 cents on the dollar, the debt
will be repurchased at a fixed spread over similar-maturity
Treasuries, calculated as at 2 p.m. New York time on Aug. 23.  The spread for the 5.125 percent notes is 110 basis points;
the spread for the 6 percent notes is 220 basis points; for the
6.125 percent notes 245 basis points; the 6.95 percent notes 295
basis points; the 8.5 percent notes 205 basis points and the
5.85 percent notes 180 basis points, according to the statement.  Bondholders tendering their securities prior to 5 p.m. on
Aug. 22 will get an additional premium of three cents on the
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
