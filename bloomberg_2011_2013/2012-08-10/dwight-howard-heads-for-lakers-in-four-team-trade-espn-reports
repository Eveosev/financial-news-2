Dwight Howard  is heading to the Los
Angeles Lakers from the Orlando Magic in a four-team trade that
also includes the Denver Nuggets and the Philadelphia 76ers,
 ESPN reported , citing people familiar with the transaction.  The Magic will get Arron Afflalo and Al Harrington from
Denver, along with Nikola Vucevic and the 76ersâ€™ top choice in
the 2012 draft, Moe Harkless, ESPN said. Orlando will also
receive one protected future first-round draft pick from each of
the other teams for All-Star center Howard, ESPN said.  The Nuggets will get Andre Iguodala from Philadelphia and
the 76ers will add  Andrew Bynum  from Los Angeles and Jason Richardson from Orlando, it said.  Howard still plans to become a free agent on July 1, ESPN
said, giving him a year to decide if he wants to re-sign with
the Lakers or join the  Dallas Mavericks , the report said.  The deal needs approval of National Basketball Association
officials who will be on a trade call today, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
