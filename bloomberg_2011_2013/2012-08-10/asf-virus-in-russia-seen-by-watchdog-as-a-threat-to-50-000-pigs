About 50,000 pigs are threatened by
the deadly African Swine Fever after four outbreaks at farms in
two days in  Russia ’s southern Krasnodar region, the country’s
food safety watchdog said.  Two ASF outbreaks were confirmed today on farms with 13,753
and 2,813 pigs respectively, the service, known as
 Rosselkhoznadzor , said on its website. Yesterday, the virus was
found on farms with 2,000 and 2,071 pigs.  There are more than 49,500 pigs bred on industrial farms
and private households in the affected area, according to
Rosselkhoznadzor.  Another outbreak was registered today in a private yard in
the Tver region in central Russia, north-west of Moscow, the
service said.  ASF, a viral disease for which there is no vaccine, is
deadly for pigs and harmless for humans, according to the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization.  Farm owners and veterinary officials should pay “extreme
attention” to guards that work on farms because the virus may
be spreading due to animal feed thefts, Nikolai Vlasov,
Rosselkhoznadzor’s deputy head, said on the website.  About 500,000 pigs have died or been killed in ASF
outbreaks in Russia since the virus was discovered in the
country in 2007, Alexei Alekseenko, Rosselkhoznadzor’s
spokesman, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
