Spot gasoline in California weakened
against futures after  Phillips 66 (PSX)  was said to delay six weeks of
work on a hydrocracker at the Rodeo refinery in Northern
California to take advantage of a fuel-price surge after a fire
that cut production at  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Richmond plant.  The 76,000-barrel-a-day Rodeo refinery put off maintenance
for at least a month at a hydrocracking unit, which makes
gasoline and jet fuel, a person with knowledge of the schedule
said yesterday. An Aug. 6 blaze at Chevron’s Richmond refinery
forced the plant’s only crude unit to shut indefinitely.  The 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery, Northern
California’s largest, is still running the fluid catalytic
cracker, which processes vacuum gasoil into gasoline and lighter
products, at 60 percent capacity off of feedstock stored in
tanks, a person with direct knowledge of operations at the plant
said Aug. 8. A unit at the Isomax hydrocracking complex is also
running at 60 percent, the person said.  California-blend gasoline in San Francisco fell 1.5 cent to
37.5 cents a gallon above futures traded on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 4:19 p.m. New York time, slipping from a
three-month high, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. The fuel has
risen 32 cents a gallon against futures since the fire.  Unbranded gasoline prices paid by wholesalers in the San
Francisco area are up as much as 40 cents a gallon.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) 
was selling unbranded, California-blend gasoline in Richmond for
$3.40 a gallon, up from $3 on Aug. 6, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  was selling the same fuel in Richmond
for $3.38 a gallon, up from $3.005 before the fire.  Benicia Plant  Valero’s 170,000-barrel-a-day Benicia refinery in Northern
California was returning a fluid catalytic cracker to planned
rates following a July 26 shutdown for compressor repairs.  California-blend gasoline in  Los Angeles  dropped 6 cents to
a premium of 20 cents a gallon against futures, the lowest level
in four days.  California-blend diesel in Los Angeles gained 1 cent to 16
cents a gallon above Nymex heating oil futures. The same fuel in
 San Francisco  tumbled 4.5 cents to 18.5 cents over futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland , Oregon,
slipped 3 cents to 23 cents above gasoline futures. Low-sulfur
diesel there rose 1 cent to a 29-cent premium against heating
oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
