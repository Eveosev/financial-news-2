Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest-consumer
electronics exporter, had its  credit ratings  put on review for a
possible downgrade by  Standard & Poor’s , citing a weak recovery.  The company’s BBB+ rating, third-lowest investment grade,
could be cut by one or two levels, the ratings company said in a
statement today. S&P may decide on the rating in coming weeks,
it said.  Sony, reeling from four consecutive annual losses, cut its
annual  profit forecast  33 percent earlier this month, as it
suffered from slowing demand and a strong yen. Deterioration in
the television business led Japan’s three largest TV makers
including  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  and Sharp Corp. to post their biggest
annual losses in the year ended in March.  S&P sees “further downside risk in Sony’s full-year
earnings,” because of factors including intensifying
competition and a stronger yen, according to the statement.  Moody’s Investors Service Aug. 6 placed the company’s
credit ratings on review, citing weaker demand and a stronger
yen. The Tokyo-based maker of Cyber-shot cameras and Bravia TVs
had its long-term rating already cut one level by Moody’s in
January and by S&P in the following month.  Sony  shares , which have lost 31 percent of their value this
year, gained 2.7 percent to 947 yen in Tokyo trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
