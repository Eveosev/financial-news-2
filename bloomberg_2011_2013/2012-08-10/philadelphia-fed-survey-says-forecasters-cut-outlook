U.S. forecasters have cut their
outlook for growth and see weaker labor market conditions, the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said in its Third Quarter
 Survey  of Professional Forecasters.  The forecasters expect gross domestic product to increase
at an annual rate of 1.6 percent this quarter, down from the
previous estimate of 2.5 percent, the regional Fed bank said in
a statement released today. The forecasters see GDP of 2.2
percent in 2012, down from 2.3 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a speech to teachers
this week that “our economy is still in a fragile recovery”
and the central bank is working to restore normal levels of
employment and growth. The  Federal Open Market Committee  said
Aug. 1 that it will provide “additional accommodation” as
needed to promote an improved job market.  The  unemployment rate  is projected to be 8.2 percent in
2012, before falling to 7.9 percent in 2013, 7.3 percent in
2014, and 7.0 percent in 2015, the Philadelphia Fed said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
