Olympic officials stripped cyclist
 Tyler Hamilton  of his gold medal from the 2004 Athens games
after the American admitted doping before the event.  The 41-year-old won the men’s individual time trial and was
18th in the men’s road race in Greece, and in a June 28 letter
to the International Olympic Committee “admitted having used
performance enhancing drugs in advance of the Athens  Olympic
Games ,” the IOC said today in an e-mailed statement. The IOC
disqualified the cyclist.  Russian silver medalist Viatcheslav Ekimov will be named
the champion, with American Bobby Julich getting the silver and
Australia’s Michael Rogers promoted to bronze.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
