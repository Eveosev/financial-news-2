The  United Nations  called for a
suspension of U.S. government-mandated ethanol output amid
surging corn prices, the Financial Times reported.  The U.S. will use about 40 percent of its corn for ethanol
production because of the Congress-enacted mandate despite
“huge damage” to the crop from the worst drought in at least
half a century, the newspaper reported, citing Jose Graziano da Silva, director-general of the UN’s Food & Agriculture
Organization.  An immediate, temporary suspension of the ethanol mandate
would allow more of the crop to be channeled toward food and
feed uses, the FT cited Graziano da Silva as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
