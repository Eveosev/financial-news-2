Dartmouth College  received a record
$172 million in philanthropic gifts for the year ended June 30,
a 16 percent increase over the previous year.  This yearâ€™s total included gifts from alumni, parents and
other donors and surpassed the previous record of $168 million
set in 2008, the Hanover, New Hampshire-based school said today
in an e-mailed statement. The Tuck School of Business received
$5.7 million from 70 percent of alumni.  The cost to attend Dartmouth, one of eight Ivy League
colleges in the U.S. Northeast, is more than  $61,000  for the
2012-2013 school year, according to the college. Its endowment
was valued at $3.4 billion as of June 2011, the most recent data
available.  In March, Dartmouth said  Leon Black , head of the New York-
based private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC, and his
wife, Debra, are contributing $48 million to a new visual arts
center. Black graduated from Dartmouth in 1973.  To contact the reporter on this story:
