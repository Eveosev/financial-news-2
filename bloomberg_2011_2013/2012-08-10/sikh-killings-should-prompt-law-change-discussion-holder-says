The killings at a Sikh temple in
suburban  Milwaukee  should prompt a discussion over whether laws
need to be changed to prevent similar occurrences in the future,
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said today.  Holder spoke at a memorial service in Oak Creek,  Wisconsin ,
telling mourners that the Sikh community has been “targeted and
victimized” in recent years due to their appearance and
beliefs.  “We should sensibly discuss if there is a need to change
our laws, and we should certainly discuss how we might change
the hearts of those so filled with hate that the despicable act
we mourn today could ever have occurred,” Holder said during
the service at Oak Creek High School. “For our nation’s law
enforcement community, our resolve to prevent acts of terrorism
and combat crimes motivated by hatred has never been stronger.”  Holder, who attended the service on behalf of President
 Barack Obama , said that the  Justice Department  and other law
enforcement agencies would continue their investigation into the
Aug. 5 shooting and that his agency would identify and implement
any changes in laws that may help prevent similar actions. He
didn’t elaborate on what might need to be changed.  Authorities identified the suspected gunman as Wade Michael
Page, 40, who police said killed himself after being wounded by
officers.  Described as a “frustrated neo-Nazi,” Page started a
“racist white-power” band called End Apathy in 2005, according
to the Montgomery, Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center,
which monitors hate groups and had been tracking him for a
decade.  The shootings are being treated as an act of domestic
terrorism by the FBI.  Congressional Request  Several months before the Wisconsin shooting, more than 90
members of Congress asked to have the FBI monitor hate crimes
directed at Sikh adherents. The lawmakers cited a “growing
concern” about such incidents in an April 19 letter to Holder
and FBI Director  Robert Mueller .  “Protecting the safety and civil rights of every person in
this country -– in our schools and neighborhoods, in our
workplaces and houses of worship -– must, and will, remain a top
priority for me and for all those who serve the American
family,” Holder said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
