Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  hired Kin Lee
as an  executive director  to trade commercial-mortgage backed
securities as the debt rallies the most in more than four years.  Lee started at the bank in New York today, Jonathan Hodgkinson, a spokesman for Nomura, said in a telephone
interview. Lee reports to James Im, head of CMBS trading in the
Americas.  Im, who was previously with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
and Barclays Plc, was hired by Nomura in 2009 as the bank
boosted its U.S. mortgage business. Lee joins the Tokyo-based
firm from Mizuho Financial Group Inc.’s U.S. securities unit,
according to records maintained by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. He previously worked at Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG, Finra records show.  Investors have been snapping up securities linked to
skyscrapers, shopping malls and hotels as the  Federal Reserve ’s
efforts to spur economic growth push  interest rates  to record
lows and stoke demand for riskier assets. Top-ranked debt backed
by commercial property loans is yielding 155 basis points, or
1.55 percentage points, more than Treasuries, the lowest spread
since at least January 2008, according to a Barclays  index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
