Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  plans
to increase production next year from an oil block in  Colombia 
near the nation’s largest crude field as the government eases
permitting delays.  The CPE-6 block may produce “some” barrels of crude this
year once the company receives an environmental license as soon
as this month, Chief Executive Officer Ronald Pantin said
yesterday in an interview in Cartagena, Colombia. Output at CPE-
6 may rise to 15,000 barrels a day next year and 120,000 barrels
by the end of 2014, he said.  “It’s something easy to develop,” Pantin said.  The government is speeding permitting, aiding production
increases, Pantin said. Colombia,  South America ’s third-largest
crude supplier, is trying to reduce delays that threaten to
derail national production targets, oil regulator Orlando
Cabrales said in June.  Pacific Rubiales gained 4.8 percent to C$23.58 at the close
in Toronto, after advancing as much as 5.6 percent.  Production from the Rubiales field, the nation’s largest,
will climb to 190,000 barrels a day at year-end from about
172,000 barrels a day now, after regulators awarded a water-
injection permit, Pantin said yesterday on a conference call
with analysts. Pacific owns the field with  Ecopetrol SA. (ECOPETL)   Acquisitions  A drop in shares of some oil producers amid a “credit
crunch” has created opportunities for acquisitions, Pantin
said. Pacific Rubiales last month finished its purchase of
Petromagdalena Energy Corp., which also produces crude in
Colombia.  Pacific Rubiales is increasing reserves through
exploration, including at CPE-6, where the company began
searching for crude in 2008, Pantin said. Pacific Rubiales owns
the venture with  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)   Colombian output slid to 929,200 barrels a day in July from
934,000 barrels a day in June, according to the government,
which targets nationwide output of 1 million barrels a day this
year. Venezuela and  Brazil  are South America’s largest crude
suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
