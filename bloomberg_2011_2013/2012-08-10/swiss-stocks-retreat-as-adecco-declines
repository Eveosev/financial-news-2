Swiss stocks  fell, paring the fourth
consecutive weekly gain for the  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , after
reports showed that China’s exports and imports slowed,
heightening concern that the global economy is slowing.  Transocean Ltd. (RIGN) , the world’s largest offshore-rig
contractor, dropped as the shares most linked to economic
expansion slid and oil retreated in  New York .  Nestle (NESN)  SA, the
heaviest stock in the SMI, declined 1.1 percent after yesterday
rising the most in 11 months.  The benchmark SMI slipped 0.3 percent to 6,483.44 at the
close in Zurich, paring this week’s increase to 0.3 percent. The
gauge has  climbed 13 percent from its 2012 low on June 4  as
policy makers eased repayment terms for Spanish lenders and
central banks took steps to stimulate economic growth. The
broader Swiss Performance Index lost 0.4 percent today.  “Fairly disappointing trade and new loans data out of
 China  have renewed worries that China’s slowdown might be more
pronounced than originally feared,” Markus Huber, head of
German sales trading at ETX Capital in  London , wrote. “So far
this week’s market action -- a consolidation at high levels --
doesn’t come as much of a surprise, especially after the
impressive run up of the previous couple of weeks.”  The volume of shares changing hands on SMI-listed companies
was 20 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Export Growth  China’s export  growth  collapsed with outbound shipments
increasing 1 percent in July from a year earlier, the country’s
customs bureau said. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey had
predicted growth of 8 percent. Exports climbed 11.3 percent at
an annual pace in June.  Imports into the world’s second-largest economy rose 4.7
percent. Analysts had  projected a gain  of 7 percent after they
increased 6.3 percent in June.  A separate release showed  new local-currency lending  of
540.1 billion  yuan  ($85 billion) last month, which was lower
than  all 30 estimates  in a Bloomberg News survey. Banks lent
919.8 billion yuan in June.  Reports yesterday showed China’s industrial-output growth
unexpectedly slowed to a three-year low and inflation cooled in
July, while retail sales missed estimates.  Transocean retreated 0.5 percent to 47.50 Swiss francs as
oil fell the most in a week in New York.  Nestle Slips  Nestle lost 1.1 percent to 60.40 francs. The stock climbed
yesterday after the world’s biggest food company reported first-
half sales growth that beat analysts’ estimates.  Bucher Industries AG (BUCN)  slid 3.7 percent to 166.50 francs. UBS
AG cut its recommendation on the stock to  neutral  from buy after
the maker of agricultural and street-sweeping machinery
yesterday reported a decline in first-half new orders.  Interroll Holding AG (INRN)  climbed 4.5 percent to 352.75 francs.
The producer of components for storage said that net sales
increased 7.5 in the first half to 147.4 million francs ($151
million).  Phoenix Mecano AG (PM)  slipped 2.1 percent to 479.75 francs. The
seller of mechanical components said first-half gross sales fell
3.3 percent to 267 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
