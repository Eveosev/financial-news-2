More than 40 percent of bonds issued
by the three biggest Australian states are held by foreigners,
according to state government funding arms.  Queensland, the largest issuer among the so-called semi-
government borrowers, estimates that about 45 percent of its
outstanding debt is overseas-owned, said Queensland Treasury
Corp.’s head of funding  Richard Jackson . New South Wales
Treasury Corp.’s Tim Hext puts the figure for his state at about
50 percent, while Treasury Corp. of Victoria’s Bill Whitford
said it was around 15 percent.  That equates to about 41 percent of the states’ combined
borrowings of A$159 billion ($167 billion), according to
calculations by Bloomberg.  “We continue to see interest from central banks globally
in our debt,” QTC’s Jackson said in a phone interview today.  Queensland has about A$76 billion in outstanding debt and
carries the second-highest credit score from the major rating
firms, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New South Wales,
the biggest AAA rated issuer among the states, has almost A$54
billion outstanding and Victoria has A$29 billion, the data
show.  Hext spoke in an interview today, while Whitford commented
on Aug. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
