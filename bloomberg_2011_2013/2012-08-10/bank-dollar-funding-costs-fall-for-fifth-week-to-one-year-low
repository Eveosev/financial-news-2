The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined for the fifth week to the lowest in
more than a year, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into U.S. dollars, was 35
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
at 8:20 a.m. in  London , from minus 39.5 on Aug. 3. It is the
lowest cost since July 26, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was unchanged at 40 basis points
below Euribor, the lowest since Aug. 3, 2011. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  The three-month Eonia OIS swap was at 7 basis points,
compared with 7.2 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The European Banking Federationâ€™s euro overnight
indexed average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at
12.3 basis points yesterday, the highest since July 12, from
11.6 the day before.  Banks increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  to 289 billion euros ($355 billion)
yesterday, from 278 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
