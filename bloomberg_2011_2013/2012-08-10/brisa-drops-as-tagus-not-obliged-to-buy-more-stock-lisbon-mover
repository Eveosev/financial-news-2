  Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal SA ,
the country’s biggest highway operator, dropped the most since
at least 1997 in Lisbon as Tagus Holdings Sarl wasn’t obliged to
buy the remaining shares.  Brisa shares fell 15 percent to 2.32 euros at the close of
trading, giving the company a market value of 1.39 billion euros
($1.71 billion).  “The fact that Tagus doesn’t have to carry out a
compulsory squeeze-out purchase of the remaining shares explains
the decline,” said Bruno Costa, a trader at Go Bulling in
Lisbon.  The Tagus Holdings Sarl venture, owned by Jose de Mello
SGPS SA, a holding company for one of  Portugal ’s richest
families, and Aeif Apollo Sarl, holds 85 percent of the toll-
road operator’s shares and 92 percent of  voting rights  after
completing a 2.76 euro-a-share bid, Brisa, based in the Lisbon
suburb of Sao Domingos de Rana, said in a  statement  yesterday.  While Tagus will consider delisting Brisa from the stock
market, the bid didn’t meet the requirements needed to allow it
to carry out a compulsory squeeze-out purchase of the remaining
shares, Jose de Mello Chairman Vasco de Mello said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
