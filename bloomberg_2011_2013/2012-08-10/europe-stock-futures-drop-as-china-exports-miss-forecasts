Most  European stocks  dropped, even
as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index completed its 10th successive
weekly gain, as worse-than-estimated Chinese trade data added to
evidence the global economy is slowing.  Bankia SA (BKIA)  led retreating shares after a 128 percent rally
in the past 11 days. Bank of Ireland Plc tumbled 3.1 percent as
its first-half loss more than doubled.  Bunzl Plc (BNZL)  fell the most
in a year after UBS AG recommended selling the stock.
 ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  climbed 5.1 percent as  Germany ’s biggest
steelmaker reported its first profit in four quarters.  The Stoxx 600 fell 0.1 percent to 269.88 at the close in
London, as more than three stocks on the gauge slid for every
two that rose. The benchmark gauge  still gained  1.6 percent this
week, its 10th week of increases, amid better-than-estimated
company earnings.  “The Chinese numbers were disappointing and will have to
be digested by the market first, which is why we’re seeing some
pressure on stocks,” said Peter Braendle, who helps manage $55
billion at Swisscanto Asset Management AG in Zurich. “We may
simply be seeing a healthy breather after the strong gains we’ve
had in the past few days.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 35 percent lower than the average of the last
30 days, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  National benchmark indexes dropped in 14 of the 18 western-
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index fell less than 0.1
percent, while Germany’s DAX slipped 0.3 percent.  France ’s CAC
40 lost 0.6 percent.  China’s Trade  China ’s export growth collapsed and imports and new  yuan 
loans trailed estimates in July, reports today showed.  Outbound shipments  increased 1 percent from a year earlier
and imports rose 4.7 percent, the customs bureau said. The
growth in July exports compared with the 8 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey and 11.3 percent in June.
Analysts estimated a 7 percent gain in imports after a 6.3
percent increase in June.  New local-currency lending was 540.1 billion yuan ($85
billion), lower than all 30 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey, after 919.8 billion yuan in June.  “Whilst markets have recently been rallying on bad news --
in the expectation that it will lead to further stimulus from
the central banks -- the deterioration in the fundamentals is
becoming a bit harder to ignore,” said Jonathan Sudaria, a
trader at Capital Spreads in  London . “Traders may be
disappointed if their thirst for stimulus isn’t satiated as soon
as they expect.”  Bankia Bailout  Bankia plunged 20 percent to 1.21 euros, snapping an 11-day
rally.  Spain ’s bank-bailout fund FROB reiterated that
shareholders in the Bankia Group will have to share the costs of
cleaning up the lender.  Bank of Ireland, the nation’s largest lender, lost 3.1
percent to 9.5 euro cents, a two-week low. The first-half pretax
loss widened to 1.26 billion euros ($1.55 billion) from 556
million euros in the year-earlier period. That was worse than
the 899 million-euro median estimate of three analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Bunzl, which provides supply services for grocery and
health-care companies, fell 4.6 percent 1,113 pence, the biggest
slump since Aug. 8 last year, after UBS AG cut the stock to sell
from neutral.  Hannover Earnings  Hannover Re  dropped 2.3 percent to 48.38 euros. The world’s
fourth-biggest reinsurer said second-quarter profit declined 13
percent because of unrealized losses on investments. Net income
fell to 144 million euros from 166.2 million euros a year
earlier. That missed the 170.5 million-euro average  estimate  of
15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Metso Oyj (MEO1V)  and  Outotec Oyj (OTE1V)  retreated 2.1 percent to 30.78
euros and 1.7 percent to 38.75 euros, respectively. JPMorgan
Chase & Co. cut Metso to underweight, the equivalent of sell,
from neutral and lowered Outotec to neutral, the equivalent of
hold, from overweight.  Aspo Oyj (ASU1V)  closed 0.2 percent lower at 5.99 euros, after
sliding as much as 6.5 percent, as the Finnish logistics company
said it expects full-year operating profit to drop
“significantly” from 2011 and earnings per share to decline
“slightly.”  Fugro NV (FUR) , the world’s biggest surveyor of deepwater
oilfields, lost 2.9 percent to 50.86 euros. First-half net
income of 115 million euros missed the average 120 million-euro
analyst estimate.  ThyssenKrupp, Barclays  ThyssenKrupp advanced 5.1 percent to 16.45 euros, the most
in seven months. Net income from continuing operations increased
16 percent to 238 million euros in the fiscal third quarter from
a year earlier. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were
122 million euros, topping analysts’ projection for 83.4 million
euros.  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the British bank fined a record for interest-
rate manipulation, climbed 2.5 percent to 183.4 pence after it
named former  Bank of England  executive director  David Walker  as
chairman, its first move to replace leaders ousted in wake of
the Libor scandal.  Schibsted ASA (SCH)  gained 8.1 percent to 201.10 kroner, leading
advancing shares on the Stoxx 600, as its second-quarter pretax
profit of 442 million kroner ($75 million) beat  analysts’
estimate  for 441 million kroner. Earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization were 596 million kroner,
compared with a forecast for 586.4 million kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
