The U.S. won the women’s 400-meter
relay at the  London  Olympics by breaking a 27-year-old world
record.  The U.S. team clocked a time of 40.82 seconds, ahead of
Jamaica in a national record of 41.41 and Ukraine in 42.04, also
a national record.  The old world mark had been set by what was then East
Germany in 1985.   Jamaica and the U.S. had split the individual sprint events
in London. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce of Jamaica won the 100-
meters, while Allyson Felix of the U.S. triumphed in the 200
meters. Fraser-Pryce started off for Jamaica today, while Felix
was the second runner for the U.S.   The American team had qualified for the final in a time of
41.64, the second-fastest in Olympic history.  Jamaica  scraped
into the final after they fumbled their second changeover in the
semifinal to leave them trailing Ukraine and finishing second
with 42.37.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
