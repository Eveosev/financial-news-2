Skye Bank Plc, (SKYEBANK)  a Nigerian lender,
fell the most in three months, after the central bank imposed a
restriction on dealers’ participation in foreign-exchange
auctions, increasing borrowing costs.  The stock fell 4.7 percent to 2.82 naira by 2:04 p.m. in
Lagos, the most on an intraday basis since May 18, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares have dropped 26 percent this
year, compared with a 12 percent rise in the  Nigeria  Stock
Exchange All Share Index.  The central bank from Aug. 1 prevented dealers from buying
foreign currency at its twice-a-week auctions using naira
purchased at a discount through the bank’s standing lending
window and repurchase facility. Nigeria’s interbank overnight
lending rate has more than doubled this month, reaching 32
percent on Aug. 8, the highest since September 2006, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “In a rising rate environment, the cost of funds will take
a hit,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based Africa bank analyst at
 Renaissance Capital , said by phone today.  The overnight rates, which declined four percentage points
yesterday, have averaged 15 percent this year compared with 11
percent in 2011.  Skye Bank plans to raise $150 million in Tier 2 capital
this year to improve its capital adequacy ratio, Timothy
Oguntayo, an  executive director , said on a conference call July
26. While the 15 percent ratio meets regulatory requirements,
“we believe this is not enough,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
