(Corrects to show spring wheat production forecast in the
fifth paragraph is millions.)  Wheat futures fell for the first
time in three sessions, reversing a weekly gain, after the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  raised its outlook for domestic
production as northern states were less affected by drought than
the Midwest.  In the year through May 31, U.S. growers will  harvest  2.268
billion bushels of wheat, up 2 percent from a July forecast of
2.224 billion, the government said in a report today. Production
last year totaled 1.999 billion bushels, USDA data show. Yields
will average 46.5 bushels an acre, up from 2 percent from last
month’s estimate, the agency said.  “The U.S. numbers were bigger than what people were
expecting,”  Larry Glenn , an analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter,
 Kansas , said by telephone. “They probably picked up some
production on the spring wheat.”  Wheat futures for December delivery dropped 3.1 percent to
$8.985 a bushel at 11:07 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
heading for a weekly decline of 0.6 percent. The price before
today was up 2.6 percent this week.  Spring-wheat production in the U.S., mostly in the northern
Great Plains, is forecast at 499.5 million bushels, up 0.6
percent from last month’s estimate and 9.7 percent from a year
earlier, the USDA said. Parts of  North Dakota , the biggest U.S.
grower of wheat, and  Minnesota  received twice the normal amount
of rainfall in the past month, National Weather Service data
show.  Spring-wheat futures for December delivery fell 2.3 percent
to $9.46 a bushel on the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange .  Winter-wheat output is seen at 1.683 billion bushels, up
0.8 percent from the July forecast and 13 percent from last
year’s drought-damaged crop, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
