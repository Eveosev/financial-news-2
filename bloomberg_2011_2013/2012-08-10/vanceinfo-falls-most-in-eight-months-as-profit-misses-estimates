VanceInfo Technologies Inc. (VIT)  fell the
most in eight months after the Chinese information technology
company forecast net income for 2012 that missed estimates and
said it will merge with  HiSoft Technology International Ltd. (HSFT)   VanceInfo, which counts  International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  among its  customers , lost 12 percent to $8.77 at 2:52 p.m.
in  New York , the largest decline since Nov. 21. Trading volume
was eight times the stock’s three-month daily average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Beijing-based VanceInfo said it expects to report adjusted
earnings per American depositary share between 75 cents and 81
cents, less than a previous forecast as high as 92 cents per
share. The average  estimate  for 2012 net income was 88 cents per
share, according to 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Vance has struggled to deliver a consistent margin
profile,” said Joseph Foresi, an analyst at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in  Boston . “Revenues were actually revised upward, so
the fact that they had to bring down earnings is concerning
because maybe it leads to further inconsistency.”  Foresi has a neutral rating on VanceInfo.  VanceInfo and HiSoft, which counts General Electric Co. and
Microsoft Corp. as customers, agreed to an all-stock merger in
which shareholders would each own approximately 50 percent of
the combined company. HiSoft will be the surviving listed stock,
and the new company will be headed by HiSoft Chief Executive
Officer Tiak Koon Loh, the companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
