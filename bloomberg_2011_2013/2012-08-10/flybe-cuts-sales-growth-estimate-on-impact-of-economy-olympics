Flybe Group Plc (FLYB) ,  Europe ’s biggest
regional airline, said full-year sales will grow no more than 2
percent, less than previously predicted, clipped by a sluggish
European economy and disruption from the royal Jubilee
celebrations and the 2012 Olympics Games.  Flybe revised its outlook after demand for business flights
from Britain to continental Europe showed “signs of weakeness”
in the fiscal first quarter ended June 30, it said today in a
statement. After four years of declines, the U.K. domestic
market showed evidence of stabilizing before slipping back into
a 3 percent decline in June versus a year earlier.  “2012/13 is proving to be another very challenging year in
the European regional aviation sector with continued weak
consumer markets and stubbornly high  oil prices ,” Chief
Executive Officer Jim French said in the statement. “We remain
cautious over the outlook and do not expect a material recovery
in either consumer or business confidence in the short term.”  Flybe will seek to keep unit-cost increases to within 1
percent of last year’s level, excluding fuel expenses. Further
savings will be achieved through capacity management and reduced
supplier costs, with an update to be provided on Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
