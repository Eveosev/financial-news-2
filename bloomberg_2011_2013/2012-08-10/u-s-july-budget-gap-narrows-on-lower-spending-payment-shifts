The U.S. government’s  budget deficit 
narrowed in July, as spending dropped by 11.9 percent from a
year earlier and some payments were accelerated to the previous
month for calendar-related reasons.  The gap shrank 46.2 percent to $69.6 billion from a $129.4
billion  shortfall  in July 2011, the Treasury Department said
today in  Washington . Last month’s gap was smaller than the
projected $90 billion deficit, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey. For the first 10 months of this
fiscal year the deficit was 11.5 percent narrower than in the
year-earlier period.  “On an underlying basis and absent policy changes, it
appears that we are on a path for the deficit to narrow by
roughly $100 billion per year,” said  Stephen Stanley , chief
economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
That is “moving in the right direction but not nearly fast
enough,” he said by e-mail before the report.  The House and Senate are currently in a five-week recess
and are set to be in session together for 13 days before the Nov.
6 election. Neither Democrats nor Republicans see an advantage
in spending time before the election on averting automatic
income tax increases and the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts that
start taking effect in January. Each side wants to try to
improve its negotiating position depending on which party will
occupy the White House and control Congress.  A Treasury official who briefed reporters said $35 billion
in monthly recurring benefit payments that would have been made
in July were accelerated to June because July 1 was a Sunday.  Revenue Rises  Revenue rose by 16 percent in July from the same month a
year earlier to $184.6 billion from $159.1 billion, and spending
fell to $254.2 billion from $288.4 billion.  Estimates of the July budget gap ranged from $71 billion to
$150 billion in the Bloomberg survey of 21 economists.  For the first 10 months of the fiscal year that began in
October, the  budget deficit  narrowed to $973.8 billion from $1.1
trillion in the same period last year.  Individual income tax receipts in the first 10 months of
this fiscal year rose to $928.2 billion from $890.7 billion in
the same period last year. Corporate income tax receipts rose to
$182.4 billion from $140.5 billion.  The  Congressional Budget Office  estimated this week the
July deficit would be $71 billion. The CBO said in a report
dated Aug. 7 that receipts increased and outlays were lower
mostly because of the timing shift in certain payments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
