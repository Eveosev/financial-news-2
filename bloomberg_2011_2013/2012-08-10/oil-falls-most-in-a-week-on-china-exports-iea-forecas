Oil fell as  China ’s export growth
slowed and the  International Energy Agency  cut demand forecasts
in signs that the global economic recovery is slowing.  Prices declined 0.5 percent as China’s customs bureau
reported outbound shipments in July increased 1 percent from a
year earlier after an 11 percent rise in June. It was the worst
export growth since 2009. The IEA reduced its estimate of 2012
world consumption by 250,000 barrels a day to 89.6 million.  “There were hopes that we might see some decent demand
growth in China but that’s looking less and less likely,” said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “The IEA reducing its forecast
for oil consumption is a confirmation of people’s fears that
demand is going to be weak.”  Oil for September delivery fell 49 cents to settle at
$92.87 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It
decreased as much as 1.8 percent to $91.71 in intraday trading.
Today’s decline trimmed a weekly advance to 1.6 percent. It was
the fourth gain in five weeks.  Brent crude  for September settlement decreased 27 cents to
end the session at $112.95 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  The July growth in Chinese exports was slower than the 8
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Imports rose 4.7
percent versus the survey estimate of 7 percent and a 6.3
percent increase in June.  Trade Surplus  “China’s export data point to troubles in the global
economy,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market is
trying to consolidate. It seems to have some momentum on the up
side even though it’s down today.”  Weaker exports reduced the country’s trade surplus to $25.1
billion in July from $31.5 billion a year earlier. The median
projection was $35.1 billion.  “We are seeing a significant slowdown in China’s exports
and it’s important to know that China is a big oil consumer,”
said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in New
York.  Customs data showed China’s net crude imports were 21.6
million metric tons in July. That’s the equivalent of 5.1
million barrels a day, the least since December.  China used 9.76 million barrels a day of oil last year last
year, making it the second-largest consumer, according to  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy, released in June. The
U.S. is the leading user.  Oil Demand  The Paris-based IEA said oil demand will average 90.5
million barrels a day next year, down from 90.9 million
estimated last month. It lowered its forecast for world economic
expansion in 2013 to 3.6 percent from 3.8 percent last month.  “The economic crisis is taking a bigger toll than
originally feared,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
the Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “The substantial slowdown
in China really put a dent in  oil prices .”  Oil also followed losses in U.S. equities. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index fell as much as 0.5 percent before rising after
oil settled. The S&P’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities dropped 0.8
percent.  The 120-day correlation between price changes of oil
futures and the S&P index rose to 66 percent yesterday, compared
with 47 percent in April and the record 67 percent reached in
July 2010.  Oil, which settled above the 100-day moving average Aug. 7
for the first time in three months, settled below the average
for the first time in four days. Buy and sell orders tend to be
clustered near chart-support levels such as moving averages.  Next Week  Crude may rise next week as refineries operate near the
highest level in five years and as tension in the  Middle East 
raises concern that supply may be disrupted, a Bloomberg survey
showed.  Ten of 21 analysts, or 48 percent, forecast crude will
advance through Aug. 17. Eight respondents, or 38 percent,
predicted that futures will fall and three said there will be
little change in prices.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 420,729
contracts as of 3:11 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 558,206
contracts yesterday, 1.1 percent above the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.46 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
