GLV Inc. (GLV/A) , a Montreal-based
industrial equipment maker, said it will shed about 10 percent
of its workforce at its water-treatment business in a bid to
return to profit.  The restructuring of its Ovivo operations will allow GLV to
target more promising markets, Chief Executive Officer Richard
Verreault said in a statement. Most of the job cuts will occur
in  Europe , GLV said.  The company, which employs about 2,200 people, said
yesterday that its fiscal first-quarter loss increased to C$5.5
million ($5.6 million) compared with a C$4.1 million loss a year
earlier. The shares have fallen 49 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
