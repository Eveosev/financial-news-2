Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) ,
Switzerland’s biggest insurer, may say second-quarter profit
fell 24 percent after a one-time gain in the year-earlier period
from the sale of 5 percent of  New China Life Insurance Co. (1336)   Net income probably fell to $1.02 billion, from $1.33
billion a year earlier, according to the average estimate of
eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Zurich Insurance will
report earnings at 6:45 a.m. on Aug. 16.  Zurich Insurance, led by Chief Executive Officer Martin Senn, booked a gain of $441 million in the second quarter of
last year from the New China Life stake sale. The company’s
combined ratio, a measure of profitability in general insurance,
probably worsened to 95.9 percent in the second quarter after
tornadoes in the U.S. and an earthquake in  Italy .  The following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and
year-earlier figures in millions of dollars, apart from the
combined ratio, which is a percentage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
