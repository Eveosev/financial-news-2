The 40 richest people on the planet
added $7.2 billion to their collective net worth this week as
 Warren Buffett  and Amancio Ortega dueled for the title of
world’s third-richest person.  Ortega, 76, bumped Buffett, 81, from the No. 3 spot on the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index on Aug. 6, after shares of  Inditex
SA (ITX) , the world’s largest clothing retailer, surged 3.8 percent in
a day. The company’s stock fell 1.8 percent yesterday, dropping
him again below the  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  chairman.  Buffett is now worth $45.5 billion, according to the index.
Ortega has a $44.8 billion fortune, up $9.5 billion this year.  “We’re treading water. It was a pretty flat market this
week,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Harris
Private Bank in Chicago, which oversees about $60 billion of
assets, said in a phone interview. “Draghi kept his mouth
closed and most of the other leaders are in their bathing suits
some place.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose for a sixth day
yesterday, the longest rally since 2010, amid speculation the
Federal Reserve will pursue more stimulus measures. Treasuries
rose and commodities fell as Chinese and French data added to
signs the global economy is slowing.  The S&P 500 added 1.07 percent during the week to close at
1405.87 in New York. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1.62
percent, closing at 269.88.  Slim, Gates  Carlos Slim , 72, remains the world’s richest person. Slim’s
fortune fell $993 million during the week. Wireless sales in
Brazil, the second-fastest growth market for the Mexican
billionaire’s  America Movil (AMXL)  SAB, have become a drag on profit as
the economy slows. He now has a net worth of $74 billion.  Bill Gates, 56, is $10.4 billion behind Slim. Shares of
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s biggest software maker, were
unchanged for the week.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
every business day at 5:30 p.m. in New York and listed in U.S.
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
