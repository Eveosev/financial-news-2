U.S. retail sales of video-game
software, hardware and accessories declined 20 percent last
month to $548.4 million, according to researcher NPD Group Inc.  Hardware sales fell the most, shrinking 32 percent to
$150.7 million from the previous year, the  Port Washington , New
York-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The industry is experiencing a long-term slump in retail
sales as buyers move to digital downloads and games played on
 Facebook Inc. (FB)  and other social sites. In the second quarter
ended June 30, U.S. consumer spending on retail games fell to $1
billion, leading to an overall decline of 16 percent. Spending
on digital content rose 17 percent to $1.47 billion, NPD said
yesterday.  “While this growth is in stark contrast to the declines in
new physical hardware and software sales, the size of digital
sales is not quite large enough to offset these declines,” NPD
analyst  Anita Frazier  said in yesterday’s statement.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  held the console lead for the 19th
consecutive month, selling 203,000 Xbox 360 units in July, the
company said in a statement today. The Redmond, Washington-based
company sold 277,000 units a year ago.  The second quarter featured a relatively light slate of new
game releases, as publishers withheld popular updates such as
shooter-games “Call of Duty” and “Halo” in anticipation of a
pickup in demand for holiday gift-giving.  Nintendo Co., the video-game machine maker trying to
recover from an annual loss, plans to begin selling on Aug. 19
in the U.S. a larger-screen 3DS XL portable game console. Also
this year, Nintendo will begin offering Wii U, the industry’s
first new home console since 2006.  Nintendo, based in Kyoto,  Japan , didn’t release individual
sales figures for July. Video-game makers voluntarily report
their sales tallies.  Sony Corp. (6758)  often doesn’t report monthly
figures, and didn’t for July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
