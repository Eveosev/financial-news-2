Soybeans rose for third straight day
as the government said U.S. farmers will harvest a smaller crop
than expected this year after the hottest temperatures in 80
years cut yields.  Growers will harvest 2.692 billion bushels (73.3 million
metric tons), down from 3.056 billion in 2012 and the lowest
since 2007, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
 report . The average estimate of 29 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News was 2.796 billion bushels. It was the largest
August cut in production since at least 1974, USDA data show.  “It’s the third-largest downside surprise in history,”
 Richard Feltes , a vice president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in
 Chicago , said in a note to clients today. “There’s a massive
soy-rationing job ahead. The soybean market is likely to make
new highs.”  Soybean futures for November delivery advanced 1.5 percent
at $16.5625 a bushel at 9:47 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
A close at that level would leave prices up 5.8 percent in three
sessions, the biggest such gain since July 20.  Through yesterday, the most-active contract rose 30 percent
since June 1 and reached a record $16.915 on July 23.  U.S. reserve supplies before next year’s harvest will total
115 million bushels, down from 130 million forecast a month ago,
the USDA said. The surplus on Aug. 31 will total 145 million
bushels, compared with 170 million estimated in July, according
to the report.  Soybeans are the second-largest U.S. crop, valued at $35.8
billion in 2011, behind corn, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
