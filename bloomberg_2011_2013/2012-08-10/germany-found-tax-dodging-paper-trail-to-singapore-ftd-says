German authorities have found
evidence showing how Swiss banks helped German tax dodgers
transfer their money to Asian destinations such as Singapore,
the Financial Times Deutschland reported.  Authorities for the first time have found a “paper trail”
leading from Switzerland to Singapore, the newspaper cited an
unnamed official who’s close to the North Rhine-Westphalia state
 Finance Ministry  as saying.  The most recent purchase of a compact disc with Swiss
account information on German clients suspected of  tax evasion 
may harden resistance in the Bundesrat, the upper German house
of parliament, to approve a German-Swiss tax accord, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
