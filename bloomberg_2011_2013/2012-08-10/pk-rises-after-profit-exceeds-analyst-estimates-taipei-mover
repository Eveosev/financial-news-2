TPK Holding Co. (3673) , a maker of touch-
screen panels, surged to the highest level in more than five
months in Taipei trading after second-quarter profit beat
analysts’ estimates.  The stock  jumped  by the 6.9 percent daily limit to
NT$381.50 as of 11:33 a.m., poised for the highest closing price
since March 5. Taiwan’s  Taiex index  fell 0.1 percent.  TPK posted second-quarter net income of NT$2.94 billion
($98 million), the Taipei-based company said in an e-mailed
statement after the market’s close yesterday. Analysts projected
NT$2.79 billion, according to the average of 12  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Fubon Securities Co. raised its rating on the company to
neutral from reduce and increased the share-price estimate by 20
percent to NT$330 after the results. The stock is expected to
outperform in coming months, given strong demand and a favorable
pricing environment, Jeff Pu, an analyst at Fubon, wrote in a
note today.  “In the second half, we expect TPK to ramp up its mid- and
large-sized products for low-priced tablets and Windows 8
notebooks, offsetting the shortfall in the iPhone and iPad,” Pu
said. “The pricing environment appears to be favorable because
of supply tightness as the result of a short-term demand
surge.”  The company, a supplier to Apple Inc., is set to gain
market share on Windows 8 touch panels, Deutsche Bank AG said in
a report. Higher entry barriers for large-size touch-panel
production is a strong positive for TPK, according to the
brokerage, which maintained a buy  rating  and has a price
estimate of NT$560.  To contact the reporter on this story:
