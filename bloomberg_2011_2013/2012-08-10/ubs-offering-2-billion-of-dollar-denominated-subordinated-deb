UBS AG (UBS) , the Swiss bank reduced two
 ratings levels  by Moody’s Investors Service in June, sold $2
billion of dollar-denominated subordinated debt.  The 10-year, 7.625 percent notes were sold by the Zurich-
based lender’s  Stamford , Connecticut, unit at par, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. They may be ranked BBB- by Standard
& Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, one level above speculative grade,
said a person familiar with the offering who asked not to be
identified, citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  The lender last sold more than $500 million of fixed-
coupon, subordinated dollar debt due in 10 years in 2006, when
the Stamford unit issued $1 billion of 5.875 percent bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  UBS, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and  Wells Fargo & Co . managed the offering,
Bloomberg data show.  Moody’s  cut  UBS’s issuer rating to A2, five levels above
speculative grade, from Aa3 on June 21. The lender’s
subordinated debt rating was lowered five levels to Baa3, the
lowest investment-grade ranking, from A1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
