Copper fell in  New York , narrowing a
weekly gain, as a collapse in Chinese export growth added to
signs of a slowing economy in the world’s biggest consumer of
the metal.  Outbound shipments rose 1 percent from a year earlier in
July, the customs bureau said today. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News forecast an 8 percent increase. Reports yesterday
showed weaker-than-predicted industrial production and retail
sales in the country.  “Chinese trade data points to a harder landing than
originally thought, prompting a renewal of pessimistic sentiment
on China, which is clearly weighing on metals,”  David Wilson ,
an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  London , said by e-mail.  Copper for September delivery fell 1.5 percent to $3.3735 a
pound by 7:44 a.m. on the Comex in New York, cutting this week’s
climb to 0.2 percent. Copper for three-month delivery slid 1.3
percent to $7,440 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  China’s economy  is at risk of weakening for a seventh
quarter. The nation’s central bank may cut lenders’ reserve
requirements “soon” and another interest-rate reduction is
“in the pipeline,” Lu Ting, head of Greater China economics at
Bank of America Corp. in  Hong Kong , said in a note.  Imports of copper into China rebounded in July from a 10-
month low, customs figures showed. Inbound shipments of the
metal and copper products were 366,548 tons.  Copper  inventories  tracked by the LME fell 1 percent to
241,250 tons, led by declines in the U.S., daily exchange
figures showed. That capped a third weekly drop to the lowest
level since June 12. Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange slid 3.7 percent to 158,052 tons this week,
according to a bourse statement.  Nickel for three-month delivery on the LME fell 1.2 percent
to $15,316 a ton, extending this week’s decline to 1.8 percent.
Open interest, or the number of outstanding futures contracts,
rose as of Aug. 8 to 183,308, the highest level since at least
September 2005.  Aluminum, zinc, lead and tin dropped in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
