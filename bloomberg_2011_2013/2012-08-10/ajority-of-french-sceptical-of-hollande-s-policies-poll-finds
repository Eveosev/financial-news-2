A majority of French are sceptical
the government’s policies to combat the country’s deficit,
illegal immigration, insecurity and deindustrialization can
succeed, Le Figaro reported, citing a poll conducted for the
newspaper by Ifop.  Of those surveyed, 46 percent said they were satisfied with
President  Francois Hollande ’s actions, the newspaper reported.  More than half, or 51 percent, said the situation in  France 
was likely to deteriorate, against 17 percent who said it was
likely to improve, according to the poll.  The newspaper didn’t provide the number of persons
questioned or the margin of error for the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
