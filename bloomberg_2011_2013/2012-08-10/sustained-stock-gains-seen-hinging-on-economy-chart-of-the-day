Economic indicators may need to
change for the better by October in order for U.S. stocks to
sustain this year’s gains, according to Myles Zyblock, chief
institutional strategist at  RBC Capital Markets .  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, shares of companies most
affected by the pace of economic growth have been out of favor
for months. The chart tracks the ratio of Morgan Stanley indexes
for cyclical and consumer-product shares since March 2009, when
a  bull market  in stocks began.  “We see one of two likely scenarios” unfolding for
stocks, Zyblock wrote two days ago in a report. The first is
that the economic gauges will rebound during the next month or
two to confirm the gains in stocks. The second is that share
prices will decline as the indicators fall further.  The cyclical-consumer ratio, cited in the Toronto-based
strategist’s report, rose only 0.2 percent for the year through
yesterday as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 12 percent.
The contrast became more pronounced in the past two months as
the  S&P 500  rebounded from its second-quarter low.  Rather than tracking the S&P 500, the cyclical-consumer
ratio tended to move in lockstep with the Institute for Supply
Management’s factory index, as the report showed. ISM readings
for June and July were less than 50, pointing to a contraction
in manufacturing.  Based on the backdrop, Zyblock wrote, higher stock prices
can be attributed to “fast money investors who’ve been caught
short, corporations with excess cash, and international equity
investors running away from their home markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
