Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the world’s most
valuable company, sold 8.34 million iPhones in the U.S. in its
most recent quarter, fewer than the previous two periods,
according to a court filing in its trial against Samsung
Electronics Co.  U.S. sales accounted for 32 percent of the 26 million
smartphones it sold worldwide in the quarter ended June 30,
according to an exhibit in a court filing yesterday in federal
court in  San Jose ,  California . Apple, which is suing Samsung for
patent infringement, hadn’t previously given a geographic
breakdown of the sales of its biggest product by country.  The fiscal third-quarter total for the U.S.  compares  with
10.7 million iPhones sold in the preceding three months and the
record 15 million sold in the last three months of 2011, the
filing showed. The sequential decline is in line with a slowdown
seen before in iPhone sales ahead of the release of a new model.  Apple has sold 86 million iPhones in the U.S. since the
product debuted in 2007. The filing showed Samsung sold 21.3
million smartphones from mid-2010 to mid-2012.  Last month the Cupertino, California-based company reported
total quarterly sales for the product that missed analysts’
predictions, causing its revenue and profit to fall short of
estimates for only the second time since 2003.  Apple sold 5.7 million iPads in its home market in the
latest quarter, 34 percent of the total of 17 million of the
tablet devices it sold worldwide, the court filing also showed.  The trial between Apple and Samsung is the first before a
U.S. jury in a battle being waged on four continents for
dominance in a smartphone market valued by Bloomberg Industries
at $219.1 billion. Each company is trying to persuade jurors at
the trial that the other infringed patents covering designs and
technology.  Apple shares were little changed at $621.70 at the close in
 New York , and is up 54 percent this year.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-
cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
