The pound weakened for a second day
against the dollar after a report showed producer prices stalled
last month, boosting speculation that slower inflation will give
the central bank more room to add stimulus.  U.K. government bonds advanced, with 10-year gilts on
course for the first weekly gain in three. Separate data showed
construction declined less than previously estimated in the
three months through June, suggesting the economy may have
contracted less than earlier forecast. The Bank of  England  cut
its growth outlook this week and Governor  Mervyn King  said
growth in the near term would be “subdued.”  “Producer prices are showing intensifying disinflationary
pressures and that leaves the door open for further monetary
easing, which should weaken the pound,” said  Lee Hardman , a
foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
in London. “The pound should remain under downward pressure.”  The pound dropped 0.3 percent to $1.5599 at 1:14 p.m.
London time, having declined 0.3 percent this week. The U.K.
currency was little changed at 78.61 pence per euro, set for a
weekly gain of 0.7 percent.  Producer prices were unchanged from June, the  Office for
National Statistics  said. They climbed 1.7 percent from a year
earlier, the smallest annual increase since October 2009, the
report showed.  Building output fell 3.9 percent in the three months
through June, a separate report showed. That compares with a 5.2
percent decline in the first estimate of gross domestic product
on July 25, which showed the economy shrank 0.7 percent.  BOE Forecasts  The  Bank of England , which left its bond-purchase target
unchanged at 375 billion pounds this month, will do all it can
to engender a recovery, King said this week.  The pound has declined 3.1 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar rose 0.7
percent and the yen gained 2.8 percent.  Gross domestic product fell 0.7 percent from the first
quarter, when it dropped 0.3 percent, according to official
data. Today’s building output data revision would mean a 0.1
percentage point upward revision to GDP, the statistics office
said today.  The yield on the  10-year gilt  fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 1.55 percent. The 4 percent bond
maturing March 2022 advanced 0.685, or 6.85 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 121.72. Over the week, yields declined one
basis point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
