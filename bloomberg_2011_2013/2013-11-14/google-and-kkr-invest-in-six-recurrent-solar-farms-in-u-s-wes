Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  KKR & Co. (KKR)  agreed to
acquire six solar farms that  Sharp Corp. (6753) ’s Recurrent Energy unit
is developing in California and Arizona in a deal worth $400
million.  The six projects have a combined capacity of 106 megawatts
and are expected to be operational by January, according to a
statement today.  Google and KKR are providing both equity and debt financing
for five projects in Southern California and one in Arizona that
will produce enough power for more than 17,000 homes.  Google said it will provide about $80 million, in a blog
 post  today. The total transaction is worth $400 million,
according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be
identified because the transaction value hasn’t been disclosed.  Google has invested more than $1 billion to date in
renewable energy; this is its 14th such deal, according to the
statement. KKR has made five renewable-energy investments.  The three companies struck a similar agreement in December
2011 involving four of San Francisco-based Recurrent’s projects
near Sacramento.  To contact the reporter on this story:
