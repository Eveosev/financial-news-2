Rubber traded near the highest
closing level in two weeks amid speculation that  China , the
world’s largest consumer, may buy the commodity to boost state
reserves.  The contract for April delivery on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange advanced as much as 0.8 percent to 259.8 yen a kilogram
($2,614 a metric ton) before trading at 258.6 yen at 10:52 a.m.
Futures settled at 259.8 yen on Nov. 1.  China’s State Reserve Bureau met Sinochem International
Corp., China Hainan Rubber Industry Group Co. and Yunnan State
Farms Group Co., the nation’s biggest domestic suppliers, about
buying 150,000 tons of rubber, two industry executives with
direct knowledge of the matter said Sept. 17. The bureau is also
in discussions to buy 50,000 tons of smoked rubber sheet
imports, according to the executives.  “Speculation grew that China will complete the purchase by
the end of this year to replenish state reserves,” said Hideshi
Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
added 0.4 percent to 19,320  yuan  ($3,171) a ton. Thai rubber
free-on-board lost 0.3 percent to 78.80 baht ($2.50) a kilogram
yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
