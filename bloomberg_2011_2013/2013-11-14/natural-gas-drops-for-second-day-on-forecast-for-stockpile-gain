Natural gas futures slid to a one-week low in New York on speculation that a government report
today will show an above-average U.S. stockpile increase.  Gas fell as much as 1.7 percent before the Energy
Information Administration may say supplies rose 23 billion
cubic feet last week, based on the median of 25  analyst
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Stockpiles expanded by 12
billion cubic feet a year earlier and the five-year average gain
for the week is 19 billion.  “It’s going to be a little bit above the five-year average
and that may be why they are taking profits,” said Phil Flynn,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “We
had six up days in a row, it was baby steps but we are wiping
that out in two days.”  Natural gas for December delivery fell 5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.516 per million British thermal units at 9:47
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange after dropping to
$3.505, the lowest intraday price since Nov. 7. Trading volume
was 6 percent below the 100-day average. Prices have climbed 4.9
percent this year.  The discount of December to January futures narrowed 0.4
cent to 4.8 cents. March gas traded 0.8 cent  above  the April
contract versus 1.1 cents yesterday.  April $6 calls were the most active options in electronic
trading. They were unchanged at 0.3 cent per million Btu on
volume of 450 at 9:49 a.m. Calls accounted for 75 percent of
trading volume.  Supply Increase  Today’s inventory report “should represent the last
injection of the year until the conclusion of the winter
season,” Jeff Dietert, managing director with Simmons & Co. in
Houston, said in a note to clients today.  The number of heating degree days, a measure of weather
related demand for gas based on population, totaled 103 in the
week ended Nov. 7, 7 percent below the 30-year norm of 111 for
the period and 18 percent lower than last year’s count of 125,
Dietert said.  A blast of cold in the eastern U.S. this week will moderate
over the next five days before below-normal temperatures again
sweep across the East Coast and into Midwest from Nov. 19
through Nov. 28, said MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland .  Cold Weather  The low in Chicago on Nov. 27 may be 17 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 8 Celsius), 12 below normal, and New York City may be 11
lower than average at 27 degrees, according to  AccuWeather Inc. 
in State College,  Pennsylvania . Atlanta may be 5 below normal at
34 degrees. About 49 percent of U.S. households use gas for
heating, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  Gas inventories  totaled 3.814 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Nov. 1, 1.5 percent above the five-year  average  for
the period, EIA data show.  “We continue to have record production, that’s why we are
above the five-year average,” Flynn said.  The government raised its production forecast for 2013 by
0.4 percent to 70.29 billion cubic feet a day from 70 billion
the previous month, the EIA said yesterday in its  Short-Term
Energy Outlook . Output will increase 1.6 percent from the 2012
record of 69.18 billion, driven higher for the sixth straight
year as new wells come online in the Marcellus shale formation
in the Northeast, the report showed.  Marcellus production may climb 3.3 percent in December to
12.9 billion cubic feet a day from an estimated 12.5 billion in
November, the EIA said yesterday in its monthly  Drilling
Productivity Report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
