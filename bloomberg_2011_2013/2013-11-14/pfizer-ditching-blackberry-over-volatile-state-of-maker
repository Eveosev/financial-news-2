Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s biggest
drugmaker, will wean off of  BlackBerry (BBRY)  Ltd.’s phones, citing
concerns that the mobile technology company might not be around
in the future or may have service interrupted.  Pfizer told employees who use BlackBerry devices to instead
get an Apple Inc. phone or one run on Google Inc.’s Android
operating system. The drugmaker cited Waterloo, Ontario-based
BlackBerry’s declining market share and noted that the company
attempted to sell itself.  “In response to declining sales, the company is in a
volatile state,” New York-based Pfizer told employees in a memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. “We recommend that BlackBerry
clients use their BlackBerry devices and plan to migrate to a
new device at normal contract expiration.”  After years of losing customers to Apple’s iPhone and
devices running Android, BlackBerry is struggling to keep
remaining users from defecting. The new BlackBerry 10 operating
system, meant to fuel a comeback, drew a tepid response from
buyers, and the company had to write off almost $1 billion in
unsold inventory last quarter.  Pfizer  had 92,000 employees  as of its last annual filing,
making it the eighth-biggest employer among U.S. and Western
European-based health-care companies, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Contingency plans have been developed in case
BlackBerry shuts down or is unable to provide services, Pfizer
said in the memo.  “We never go out in the media and talk about our service
providers,” said Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokeswoman.  A $4.7 billion takeover bid for BlackBerry was scrapped
this month, prompting a shakeup at the company. BlackBerry
installed former Sybase Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Chen
as the head of the company and raised $1 billion in convertible
debt to help bolster its disappearing cash.  In a  blog post on Nov. 13 , Chen tried to reassure customers
that the company is not going anywhere.  “We also want our customers to know that BlackBerry has
significant financial strength for the long-haul,” he said. “I
am confident that we will rebuild BlackBerry for the benefit of
all of our constituencies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
