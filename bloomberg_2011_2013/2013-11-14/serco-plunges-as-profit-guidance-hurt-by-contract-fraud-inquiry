Serco Group Plc (SRP)  forecast a decline
in profit next year as it grapples with a criminal inquiry into
the handling of U.K. government prison contracts, sending its
shares to the lowest since August 2009.  Serco forecast full-year operating profit of about 307
million pounds ($492 million), compared with an estimate from
analysts, given by the Hook, England-based company, of 325
million pounds. Serco also said it would cut 400 jobs from its
47,000-strong U.K. workforce in an effort to reduce costs.  “In recent months, our relationship with U.K. government
has been impacted by the issues arising on certain contracts
with the Ministry of Justice,” the company said today in a
statement. “Versus the equivalent in previous years, and in
part as a consequence of the ongoing issues with our U.K.
government customer, there has been a lower level of new
contract awards.”  Former Chief Executive Officer Christopher Hyman resigned
last month amid an inquiry into claims that Serco overcharged
the U.K. government for tagging criminals. Serco generated about
56 percent of its revenue from the U.K. in 2012, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Serco shares fell as much as 11.2 percent, the most since
August 29, and traded 11 percent lower at 450.5 pence at 8:25
a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
