CME Group Inc. (CME) , the owner of the
world’s largest futures market, renewed a 364-day credit line
and boosted it to $7 billion from $5 billion.  The financing pact can be expanded to as much as $10
billion, CME said in a regulatory filing yesterday. Funds
borrowed under the arrangement can be used to provide temporary
liquidity to satisfy obligations of any defaulted clearing
members or back money transfers.  Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of China, The
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Citigroup Inc., BMO Harris Bank
NA, Barclays Plc, The Bank of  Nova Scotia , Fifth Third Bank,
Lloyds Bank Plc, and  Wells Fargo & Co . are providing the
financing. Chicago-based CME will pay interest at 1.5 percentage
points more than lending benchmarks for borrowings under the
credit line, according to the filing.  CME’s existing line of credit provided for loans as much as
$5 billion at Sept. 30, the company disclosed in a Nov. 8
filing.  CME’s clearinghouse guarantees futures and swaps contracts
based on  interest rates , Treasuries, gold, oil, the
creditworthiness of companies, and currencies. Clearinghouses
require margin as protection against losses should traders
default on their obligations.  Founded in the 19th century, CME’s business spans
agricultural, energy, metal and financial futures. Interest-rate
futures are CME’s biggest business.  In a revolving line of credit, money may be borrowed again
once it’s repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
