Portugal’s hotels recorded a 4.3
percent rise in revenue in September from the same month last
year as overnight stays by German, British, Spanish, French and
U.S. tourists increased.  Revenue rose to 230 million euros ($309 million) in
September, the Lisbon-based National Statistics Institute said
today in an e-mailed statement. In the first nine months of the
year, revenue increased 4.9 percent to 1.59 billion euros.  Tourism represents about a tenth of Portugal’s gross
domestic product, according to the  Economy Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
