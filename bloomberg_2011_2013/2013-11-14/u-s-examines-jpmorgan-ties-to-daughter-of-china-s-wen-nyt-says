U.S. authorities are examining
 JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM)  ties to a consulting firm owned by the
daughter of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao as part of a probe
into whether the bank awarded contracts and jobs in order to win
business deals, the New York Times reported today.  JPMorgan is cooperating with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn, which are
leading the investigation, and also conducting its own internal
review, the newspaper reported. The bank hasn’t been accused of
any wrongdoing, according to the report.  Lisa Liang, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
