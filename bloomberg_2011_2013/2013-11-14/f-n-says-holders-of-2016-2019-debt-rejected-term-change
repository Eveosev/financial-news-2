Holders of  Fraser & Neave Ltd.’s (FNN)  5.5
percent 2016 and 6.0 percent 2019 notes voted against allowing
the company to amend the terms of the  debt , hindering plans to
spin off a property unit without causing a default.  Investors in three other series of the beverage and
property conglomerate’s debt supported the amendment plan, the
company said in a statement late yesterday.  The company, controlled by Thai billionaire  Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi , had asked holders of S$808.25 million ($648
million) of debentures to waive certain default clauses and
allow the company to buy back the securities on or before June
30, 2014 for a fee, according to Oct. 28 announcements.  F&N and its treasury “will consider their options in light
of this result and will make an announcement at the appropriate
time,” F&N said yesterday.  F&N plans to carve off its real estate division via a
Singapore listing later this year. The 130 year-old group is
seeking to separate that division from its other operations
including its beverages and publishing units to focus on each
units’ individual expansion strategies after the S$13.8 billion
takeover by  Thailand ’s richest man.  Jennifer Yu, a Singapore-based investor relations manager
at F&N, said last week when asked about the proposed bond deal
that the company had “considered all options” and decided the
buy back offer would “be the most consistent and fair approach
for us to adopt.”  Terms Offered  Singapore-based F&N offered to pay S100 cents on the dollar
and a fee worth half of the note’s coupon and the accrued
interest on the date that it can call the securities, the
documents last month show.  The terms offered were below market levels for F&N’s higher
coupon bonds, three investors in the S$108.25 million 5.5
percent notes due 2016 said last week, all of whom intended to
vote against the proposal.  F&N shareholders voted in favor of the spin off of Frasers
Centrepoint Ltd. at an extraordinary general meeting on Nov. 13,
according to a company release.  Shares in F&N closed down 0.2 percent at S$5.79 in
 Singapore . Its S$108.25 million 5.5 percent 2016 debentures were
yielding 2.689 percent on Nov. 13 compared with 2.430 percent at
the start of the quarter, Bloomberg-compiled prices show.  Bonds subject to the vote yesterday also included S$150
million of 3.62 percent debt, S$50 million of 2.45 percent
securities due 2015, S$220 million of 2.48 percent notes due
2016 and S$80 million of 3.15 percent debentures due 2018,
according to F&N’s Oct. 28 announcement.  Holders of the first three of those series approved the
company’s plan. A quorum of holders to the 2018 bonds, which the
F&N refers to as seven-year bonds, wasn’t achieved and the vote
on amending that debt will be held again on Nov. 29, the company
said.  Charoen, who acquired F&N via his companies including Thai
Beverage Pcl earlier this year, has a net worth of $8.9 billion,
according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
