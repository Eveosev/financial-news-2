Canadian Industry Minister  James
Moore  said telecommunications companies that acquired wireless
spectrum between 2004 and 2009 must use the airwaves or lose
their licence.  The licences, which cover the 2300 Megahertz and 3500
Megahertz spectrum bands, are up for renewal in March.  “Our government will only renew spectrum licences for
those holders that have met all conditions of licence,” Moore
said today in a statement. “Those that have not used the
spectrum will lose it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
