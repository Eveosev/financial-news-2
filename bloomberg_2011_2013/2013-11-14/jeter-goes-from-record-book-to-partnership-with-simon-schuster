Derek Jeter  has his name in Major League Baseball’s record book. Now the New York Yankees’ shortstop has plans to put his name on other books as part of a publishing partnership with Simon & Schuster.  With an eye on his career after baseball, the 39-year-old Jeter has created Jeter Publishing, which will identify and help create sports-related books -- both fiction and non-fiction -- for adults and children. It will also publish books about pop culture and the arts.  Jeter has played 19 seasons with the Yankees, winning five World Series championships, and holds MLB career postseason records for games played, hits and runs scored. He also holds team records for hits, games played, stolen bases and at-bats with a franchise that’s won a record 27 titles.  “This is an exciting way for me to discover and develop new books, sharing insights of my own, or from people I believe have interesting stories, philosophies or practices to share,” Jeter said in a statement.  Jeter will publish adult titles in conjunction with the Gallery Books unit, with children’s titles under the Little Simon, Paula Wiseman Books, and Simon Spotlight imprints.  “Derek Jeter brings his talent, strong work ethic and charm to anything he attaches his name to,” Gallery Books President  Louise Burke  said in a statement. “Jeter Publishing will allow this elite athlete to share his passions with readers of all ages and interests.”  Nightmare Season  Jeter will turn 40 in June and is coming off a season he described as an injury-filled nightmare, playing in only 17 games amid four stints on the disabled list. The 13-time All-Star hit a career-low .190 in 73 plate appearances as the Yankees missed the playoffs for just the second time since 1995, the year he was called up to the major leagues.  Jeter signed a one-year, $12 million contract two weeks ago to play his 20th season with the Yankees. He also has a signature line of sports apparel under Nike Inc.’s Jordan Brand.
