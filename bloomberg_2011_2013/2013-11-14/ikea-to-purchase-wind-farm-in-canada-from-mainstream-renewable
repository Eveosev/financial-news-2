Ikea Group, the largest home-furnishings retailer, plans to buy a 46-megawatt wind farm in
 Alberta , Canada, from Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd.  Mainstream, which has begun construction on the C$90
million ($86 million) project, will operate and maintain the
wind farm after it’s completed in the second half of next year,
the Dublin-based developer said today in a statement.  “This wind farm in Alberta, along with existing solar
installations at three of our Ontario stores, is a significant
step to achieving Ikea’s global ambition to be energy
independent by 2020,” Kerri Molinaro, president of IKEA Canada,
said in the statement.  Ikea in August agreed to buy a wind farm in Ireland from
Mainstream as part of the retailer’s plan to invest 1.5 billion
pounds ($2.4 billion) in wind and solar by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
