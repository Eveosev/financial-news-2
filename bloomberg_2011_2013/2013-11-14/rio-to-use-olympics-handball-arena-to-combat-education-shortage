The handball arena will be moved and
converted into four public schools in  Rio de Janeiro  after the
2016  Summer Olympics , a first for the games.  Organizers said yesterday they had opened a construction
tender for the “nomadic architecture” of what will be a
federally funded 178 million reais ($76.8 million) project, part
of the city’s efforts to increase the number of hours of
education available.  Rio has committed 2.1 billion reais on building and
refurbishing schools to ensure 35 percent of children receive a
minimum of seven classroom hours a day by 2016, an amount now
available to 17 percent of the city’s students.  “This is the first time that this concept of nomadic
architecture will be used in the Olympics, ensuring that even a
temporary installation can provide a tangible legacy for the
city,” Maria Silvia Bastos, president of the municipal Olympic
committee, said in a statement.  The use of public money on sports projects has come under
scrutiny in  Brazil  since June when protesters used the staging
of soccer’s Confederations Cup to complain about the costs of
the Olympics and next year’s soccer  World Cup . Organizers of the
Rio Games have repeatedly delayed publishing their budget. In
its bid, Rio said about $15 billion in public and private
financing would be needed to stage the event.  “This decision is in line with the vision of city hall and
the federal government to prioritize cost savings, simplicity
and convenience in the preparation of the city for the  Olympic
Games ,” according to a statement from city hall.  The 12,000-person capacity handball arena will be built in
an area of about 35,000 square meters at the Olympic Park, and
is expected to be completed in the second half of 2015,
officials said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
