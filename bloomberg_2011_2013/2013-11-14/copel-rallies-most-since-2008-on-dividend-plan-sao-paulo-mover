Cia. Paranaense de Energia , the
Brazilian electricity distributor known as Copel, rallied the
most in five years after saying it will pay a dividend equal to
half its net income in the first six months of this year.  Shares  rose  8.5 percent to 32.82 reais at 12:31 p.m. in Sao
Paulo. A close at that level would be the biggest-one day gain
since October 2008. It was the best performer on the Ibovespa
stock benchmark, which climbed 1.6 percent.  Copel will pay dividend and interest on capital of 325
million reais ($139 million) to shareholders of record as of
Nov. 26, according to a regulatory filing yesterday after
markets closed. Holders of the  class B  preferred stock, which is
typically the most-actively traded, will receive a payout of
1.25 reais per share, the company said.  The utility based in Curitiba,  Brazil , was expected to
maintain dividends no higher than 40 percent of net income, and
the announcement signals that “the 50 percent payout ratio
could become the ‘new normal’ for Copel” given its relatively
low debt, Citigroup Inc. analysts including Marcelo Britto wrote
in a note to clients.  The company’s ratio of debt to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization in the past 12 months is
1.98, which compares with an average of 8.68 times for companies
on the Ibovespa and 2.43 times for its global peers, according
to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Copel has made two dividend distributions so far in 2013.
The planned payout announced yesterday would bring this year’s
total to 2.28 reais per preferred share, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Copel has advanced 3.5 percent this year, which compares
with an 6.2 percent decline for Brazil’s Electric Energy Index
of 16 power utilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
