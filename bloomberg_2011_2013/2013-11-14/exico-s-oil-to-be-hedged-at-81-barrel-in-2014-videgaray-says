Mexican oil will be hedged at $81
per barrel next year to protect against budget shortfalls due to
crude price volatility, according to Finance Minister Luis Videgaray.  Congress changed the estimated oil price to $85 from $81 in
the approved 2014 budget plan, which forecasts a deficit of 1.5
percent of gross domestic product. Oil hedges for 2014 cost
 Mexico  around $450 million, Videgaray said.  Mexico’s hedging contracts are included in annual budget
discussions when government officials estimate incoming oil
revenue. The hedging program is usually the world’s largest of
its type, Finance Ministry officials have said.  Oil exports in 2014 will be “completely covered” at $81
per barrel, Videgaray said. State-owned oil producer  Petroleos
Mexicanos , which has posted losses four straight quarters as
crude output declines, funds about a third of the  federal
budget .  Mexico would consider further hedging if necessary,
Videgaray said. “Depending on whether opportunities exist that
demonstrate a good combination of risk and benefit, we’d be in a
condition to take that opportunity,” he said.  Mexico, the third largest supplier of oil to the U.S.,
hedged oil revenues at $86 per barrel in 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
