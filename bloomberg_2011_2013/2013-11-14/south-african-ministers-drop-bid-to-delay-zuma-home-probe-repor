South African ministers dropped a
bid to delay the release of a report into the use of public
funds to renovate President  Jacob Zuma ’s private home, a
spokesman for Public Protector Thuli Madonsela said.  The ministers were scheduled to appear in a high court
tomorrow to ask for more time to study Madonsela’s provisional
report into the use of at least 206 million rand ($20 million)
on upgrading Zuma’s home in Nkandla, 430 kilometers (270 miles)
southeast of  Pretoria , the capital.  “We are aware that the state has withdrawn the court
action to stop the release of the provisional report,” Oupa
Segalwe, a spokesman for the Public Protector, the anti-graft
ombudsman, said today by phone from Pretoria.  In an affidavit filed Nov. 12, Madonsela accused ministers
of attempting to block her investigation.  “There were attempts by the minister of police, and
thereafter collectively by the ministers of police, public works
and state security (with the assistance of the acting state
attorney and the chief state law adviser) to stop the
investigation,” Madonsela said in the affidavit.  The Ministry of Public Works detailed the cost of the
renovations in January, saying 135 million rand was spent on
“operational needs,” 71 million rand on security features such
as fencing and consultants, and about 27 million rand for
changes to the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
