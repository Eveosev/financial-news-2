Hog futures declined for the third
straight session on signs that U.S. pork demand is slowing,
while lower feed costs are encouraging producers to boost animal
weights. Cattle prices traded little changed.  Wholesale  pork  fell 3.2 percent to 92.19 cents a pound
yesterday, and are down 17 percent from this year’s high on June
26, U.S. Department of Agriculture date show. Average hog-carcass  weights  climbed 1.7 percent in the 12 months through
Nov. 12, according to the USDA. The price of corn, the main
ingredient in livestock feed, has slumped 39 percent this year
on the outlook for a record crop.  “Input costs are reasonable, like corn, and we have added
record weights to the hogs,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview. “It’s profitable for the producer to add extra
weight.”  Hog futures for February settlement fell 1.1 percent to
89.8 cents a pound at 9:47 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The contract dropped 1.6 percent in the previous two
days.  Cattle futures for February delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$1.34575 a pound on the CME. The most-active contract gained 1.7
percent this year through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.3
percent to $1.652 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
