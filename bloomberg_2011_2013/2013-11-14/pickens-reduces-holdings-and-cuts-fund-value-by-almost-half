Energy investor  T. Boone Pickens 
sold off holdings in 25 companies including Apache Corp.,
reducing the value of his hedge fund by almost half in the third
quarter.  The value of Pickens’s Dallas-based BP Capital Management
LP equity holdings fell 41 percent to $60.1 million as of Sept.
30, from $101.9 million at the end of the second quarter,
according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F with the SEC within 45 days of
each quarter’s end to show their U.S.-listed stocks, options and
convertible bonds. The filings don’t show non-U.S. securities or
how much cash the firms hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
