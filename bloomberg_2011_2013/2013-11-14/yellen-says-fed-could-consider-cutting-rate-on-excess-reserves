Janet Yellen, the nominee for
chairman of the Federal Reserve, said policy makers in the past
have weighed cutting the interest rate on excess reserves, and
could again consider using the tool to provide additional
stimulus.  “It certainly is a possibility,” Yellen said in response
to a question during testimony today to the Senate Banking
Committee. So far, U.S. central bankers have been concerned that
lowering the rate would damage the functioning of the money-market, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
