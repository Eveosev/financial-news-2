European stocks  advanced for the
first time in three days as Federal Reserve chairman nominee
 Janet Yellen  said she is committed to promoting a strong U.S.
economic recovery and will ensure monetary stimulus isn’t
removed too soon.  Bouygues SA jumped 6.2 percent after reporting an increase
in third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  Ophir
Energy (OPHR)  Plc surged 10 percent after it sold a 20 percent stake in
three gas blocks for $1.3 billion. RWE AG declined 5.1 percent
after saying profit next year will slide because of weak power
prices. Serco Group Plc tumbled the most in at least 22 years
after it forecast a decline in profit next year.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.8 percent to 322.43 at
the close of trading. The gauge has rallied for the past five
weeks as the Fed maintained the pace of its bond purchases and
the  European Central Bank  lowered its key interest rate.  “Comments from the Fed’s Yellen were perceived as being
dovish, which helps support market gains,”  Richard Hunter , head
of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in  London , wrote in an e-mail. “Conditions remain supportive for equities – a
continuation of loose monetary policy looks likely and recent
quarterly earnings have generally beaten expectations, so these
factors could augur well for the traditional Santa rally.”  Yellen said the economy and labor market are performing
“far short of their potential” and must improve before the
central bank can begin reducing monetary stimulus.  “It’s important not to remove support, especially when the
recovery is fragile and the tools available to monetary policy,
should the economy falter, are limited given that short-term
 interest rates  are at zero,” she said in testimony to the
Senate Banking Committee in  Washington  today.  ‘Well Timed’  “Yellen’s comments are well timed as investors are nervous
about tapering,” Witold Bahrke, who helps oversee $55 billion
as a senior strategist at PFA Asset Management in Copenhagen,
said by phone. “There is a lot of noise at the moment and not
much news, but right now the noise is supportive.”  Gross domestic product  in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.1
percent in the three months through September, down from a 0.3
percent expansion in the second quarter, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. That’s in line with
the median forecast in a  Bloomberg News survey  of 41 economists.  National benchmark indexes rose in 16 of the 18 western
European markets today. France’s CAC 40 added 1 percent,
 Germany ’s DAX climbed 1.1 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100
increased 0.5 percent.  Bouygues Advances  Bouygues (EN)  jumped 6.2 percent to 29.52 euros. The French
building and telecommunications company said third-quarter
current operating profit rose to 542 million euros ($728
million) from 478 million euros a year earlier. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast 465 million euros, according
to the average of four estimates.  Ophir Energy surged 10 percent to 362.1 pence, for the
biggest gain on the Stoxx 600. The U.K oil and gas explorer sold
stakes in the gas blocks offshore Tanzania in  East Africa  to
Pavilion Energy Pte, the liquefied natural gas unit of Temasek
Holdings Pte,  Singapore ’s state-owned investment company.  Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN)  advanced 2.5 percent to 258.5
euros after it said third-quarter profit rose 64 percent,
beating analysts’ estimates. Net income jumped to $1.1 billion
from $672 million a year ago, Switzerland’s biggest insurer said
in a statement. That beat the $993.5 million average estimate of
eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Burberry Gains  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  added 1.9 percent to 1,489 pence after
saying first-half sales exceeded 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion)
for the first time as online revenue increased. Adjusted pretax
profit for the six months ended Sept. 30 rose to 174 million
pounds from 173 million pounds a year earlier, the U.K.’s
largest luxury-goods maker also said in a statement.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  climbed 2 percent to 105.5 pence. The
U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by volume forecast an
improvement in “all of our key financial metrics for the second
half of 2013,” driven by a better trading environment.  RWE slipped 5.1 percent to 25.76 euros. The German utility
company said that recurrent net income, the measure used to
calculate the dividend, will drop to 1.3 billion euros to 1.5
billion euros in 2014 from around 2.4 billion euros forecast for
this year.  German peer EON AG slid 1.7 percent to 13.54 euros. A gauge
of utilities companies dropped the most of the 19 industry
groups in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Serco (SRP)  tumbled 17 percent to 419.1 pence after it forecast a
decline in profit next year as it grapples with a criminal
inquiry into the handling of U.K. government prison contracts.
Serco predicted full-year operating profit of about 307 million
pounds, compared with an estimate from analysts, given by the
Hook, England-based company, of 325 million pounds.  CaixaBank SA (CABK)  fell 10 percent to 3.41 euros, its biggest
drop since October 2008, after owner  La Caixa  sold an 8.6
percent  stake  in Spain’s third-biggest bank for 1.65 billion
euros to boost its own capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
