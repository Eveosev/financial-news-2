Cardinal Energy Ltd., a producer of
oil in  Alberta , is seeking to raise as much as C$250 million
($238 million) by selling shares in an initial public offering,
according to two people familiar with the plans.  The Calgary-based company plans to make a regulatory filing
next week for the sale of shares for C$10 to C$10.50 each,
paying a dividend yield of about 6.5 percent, said one person.
The people asked not to be identified as the plans are private.  The sale, being led by banks including Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce and  Royal Bank of Canada,  would be the biggest
energy IPO this year since Oryx Petroleum Corp., the Calgary-based explorer of oil in  Africa , raised C$250.5 million in May.  Cardinal, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott Ratushny, will produce 5,500 to 6,000 equivalent barrels of
crude a day from Alberta wells after it closes a  purchase of
assets from  Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (PWT)  this year, said one of the
people. Ratushny is the former CEO of Midway Energy Ltd., which
 Whitecap Resources Inc. (WCP)  acquired last year.  Ratushny didnâ€™t immediately return a phone call seeking
comment on the IPO today. Gillian McArdle, a spokeswoman at RBC,
and Tom Wallis, a spokesman at CIBC, and Clayton Paradis, a
spokesman for Calgary-based Penn West, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
