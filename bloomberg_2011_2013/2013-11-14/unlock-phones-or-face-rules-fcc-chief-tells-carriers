Wireless carriers need to agree to
let consumers unlock smartphones or face U.S. regulations
mandating the change, the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission said.  Unlocking alters software so a phone can be used on a
competitor’s network. The practice of unlocking was ruled a
copyright violation in a ruling from the Library of Congress
that took effect last year.  “It is now time for the industry to act voluntarily or for
the FCC to regulate,” Tom Wheeler, the Democratic chairman of
the agency, said in a letter today to Steve Largent, president
of CTIA-The Wireless Association. Wheeler proposed having a
policy in place “before the December holiday season.”  Members of the Washington-based trade group include the
four largest U.S. carriers led by  Verizon Wireless (VZ)  and AT&T Inc.  “We look forward to continuing discussions under Chairman
Wheeler’s leadership,” Scott Bergmann, CTIA vice president,
regulatory affairs, said in an e-mailed statement. The group
supports an unlocking bill that is before Congress, Bergmann
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
