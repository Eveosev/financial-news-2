Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, will cut 1,700 jobs in its British
branches, according to labor union Unite.  Cashiers, branch managers and support staff will see their
jobs eliminated and were told today, Unite said in a statement
on its website today. Employees will be offered severance
packages, London-based Barclays said in a separate statement.  Barclays Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins  said in
February he is seeking to cut 1.7 billion pounds ($2.7 billion)
in annual expenses by 2015, eliminating 3,700 jobs.  “Such a massive reduction will be very detrimental to the
bank and will also be hugely challenging for the staff
remaining,” Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said in the
labor union’s statement.  Barclays said last week it is closing a consumer-banking
call center in Coventry,  England , by June, cutting as many as
350 jobs, according to Unite. Some of those positions will be
relocated to other sites, according to the bank.  “As a result of technological changes, we will be able to
provide better service for our customers with fewer staff in our
branches,” Barclays said in the statement. “Today, we have
outlined a voluntary redundancy scheme for those colleagues who
are interested.” The company didn’t provide any details on the
severance packages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
