New Zealand financial adviser  David
Ross  was sentenced to 10 years and 10 months in jail today for
running the nation’s biggest-ever Ponzi scheme.  Ross, 63, was sentenced in Wellington District Court after
pleading guilty to eight charges including false accounting and
theft, the  Serious Fraud Office  said in an e-mailed statement.
Large portions of client portfolios managed by closely-held Ross
Asset Management Ltd. were fictitious and overstated investment
positions by more than NZ$385 million ($319 million), the SFO
said. The total loss to investors was more than NZ$115 million,
it said.  “More than 1,200 client accounts were affected by Mr
Ross’s scheme, so his offending has had a devastating impact on
many lives,” SFO Director Julie Read said in the statement.
“The financial losses are not only significant to those
individuals, but they will have a flow-on effect as those
investors’ dealings in the New Zealand economy are impacted.”  The SFO and the Financial Markets Authority brought charges
against Ross in June, alleging he ran a  Ponzi scheme  after Ross
Asset Management collapsed in November last year.  About 45 New Zealand finance companies failed between 2006
and 2011, according to the report of a parliament inquiry
published in October 2011. The failures -- either receiverships
or debt moratoriums agreed with investors -- put at risk NZ$6
billion of deposits and affected at least 150,000 people, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
