Hong Kong  stocks  rose for the first
time in three days after  Janet Yellen , nominated to lead the
 Federal Reserve , said the  U.S. economy  must improve before
cutting stimulus. Tencent Holdings Ltd. rebounded even after
missing earnings estimates.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.8 percent to 22,633.81 as of
9:33 a.m. in Hong Kong, with about 10 shares rising for each
that fell on the 50-member gauge. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index added 0.9 percent to 10,370.23.  The Hang Seng Index has advanced 13 percent from this
year’s low on June 24 through yesterday amid signs China’s
economy is stabilizing. Hong Kong’s benchmark index  traded  at
10.71 times estimated earnings, compared with 16.10 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index yesterday.  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.2 percent today. The measure
gained 0.8 percent to a record yesterday as investors speculated
the central bank will maintain accommodative monetary policy and
Macy’s Inc. led retailers higher.  Yellen said the economy and labor market are performing
“far short of their potential” and must improve before
stimulus can be reduced. The Fed may start tapering in March,
with analysts surveyed by Bloomberg on Nov. 8 expecting monthly
bond purchases to fall to $70 billion from $85 billion.  The HSI Volatility Index, which measures the cost of
options on the Hong Kong equity gauge, fell 1.4 percent to
16.16, halting an eight-day advance, the longest such streak
since January 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
