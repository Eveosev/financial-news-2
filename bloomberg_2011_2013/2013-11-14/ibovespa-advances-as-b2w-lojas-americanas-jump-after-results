The Ibovespa climbed to a one-week
high after retailer  Lojas Americanas SA (LAME4)  and its unit B2W Cia.
Digital gained after posting results that were better than
analysts had estimated.  Power utility  Cia. Paranaense de Energia  was the best
performer on the gauge after announcing a dividend payment of
325 million reais ($140 million). Steelmaker  Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA (CSNA3)  and homebuilder  Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3)  also
rallied after reporting third-quarter results.  The Ibovespa rose 1 percent to 52,750.08 at 10:23 a.m. in
Sao Paulo, with 63 of its 72 stock members trading higher. The
real climbed 0.4 percent to 2.3247 per U.S. dollar. The MSCI
World Index added 0.3 percent after Fed chairman nominee  Janet Yellen  said the U.S. economy must improve before monetary
stimulus is pared.  “We had some companies that reported good earnings among
the top performers today, pushing the index higher,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, a strategist at Futura Corretora brokerage in
Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview. “Stocks are also reacting
to Yellen’s remarks about the stimulus program in the U.S.”  Lojas Americanas climbed 3.1 percent to 15.76 reais. The
company posted adjusted net income of 97 million reais in the
third quarter, more than the average estimate of 93 million
reais, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. B2W, which
posted a loss that was less than analysts had forecast, jumped
5.5 percent to 13.82 reais.  CSN, as Cia. Siderurgica is known, added 4.7 percent to
12.77 reais. Brookfield advanced 1.8 percent to 1.14 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
