(Corrects Aventine’s location and number of ethanol plants
in 11th paragraph of story published yesterday)  Ethanol gained for a sixth straight
session after a government report showed that rising U.S. output
wasn’t enough to boost supplies.  Ethanol increased 0.5 percent as  inventories  declined
12,000 barrels to 15.2 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 8,
the Energy Information Administration said today. Production
jumped 2.8 percent to 927,000 barrels a day, the highest level
since Feb. 10, 2012,  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline widened 4.67 cents to 90.57
cents after stockpiles of the motor fuel dropped, sending
gasoline prices to a four-week high.  “Demand is outpacing output, leaving little room to
replenish stockpiles,” Renato Dias, a Campinas, Brazil-based
analyst for Intl FCStone Inc., said in a telephone interview.  Denatured ethanol for December settlement extended its
longest winning streak since May, advancing 0.9 cent to close at
$1.778 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Prices have
dropped 19 percent this year.  Ethanol output will rise to 900,000 barrels a day next
year, the EIA said yesterday in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook. That compares with a previous forecast of 890,000
barrels and the outlook for 860,000 this year, the agency said.  Gasoline for December delivery advanced 5.57 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $2.6837 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest close since Oct. 16. The
contract covers reformulated gasoline made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Prices for corn, the main feedstock used to make ethanol,
declined 0.8 percent. Corn for December delivery dropped 3.25
cents to $4.265 a bushel in Chicago.  Farmer Reaction  The profit for making ethanol, the so-called crush spread,
rose to 23 cents from 21 cents yesterday.  “Farmers are starting to move some more corn,” Jeff
Duckworth, a corn buyer for ethanol producer  Aventine Renewable
Energy Holdings Inc. (AVRW) , said today in a telephone interview from
Pekin, Illinois. “Growers are disappointed with corn prices and
are starting to give up holding onto the corn.”  The harvest in  Illinois  is about 90 percent complete, he
said. Aventine, based in Pekin, owns six ethanol plants.  Corn growers in the U.S., the world’s largest producer, are
expected to harvest a record 13.989 billion bushels, according
to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  RINs Gain  The Environmental Protection Agency uses Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs, tracking certificates attached
to each gallon of biofuel to track compliance with regulations.  Corn-based RINs gained 3 cents to 22 cents, while  advanced
RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol rose 4 cents to 26 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol advanced 1 cent to $2.26 a
gallon in  New York  and 10.5 cents to $2.08 on the West Coast,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices fell 2.5 cents to $1.925
a gallon in Chicago and 1.5 cents to $2.025 on the  Gulf Coast .  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf was 5.5 cents,
compared with a discount of 6.5 cents yesterday, while Chicago’s
discount to New York expanded 3.5 cents to 33.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
