Heston Blumenthal's no stranger to the travel scene: The London-based chef (Dinner, Fat Duck) designed a special in-flight meal for British Airways during the  2012 summer Olympics , and now he's set to take on Heathrow itself. Blumenthal's  newest restaurant  will open in the airport's rehabbed Terminal 2 next June. Unlike at Dinner, where  chicken liver is disguised as an orange  and  pigeon is boiled in ale , this restaurant will focus on modern-day comfort foods—with twists, of course. The pizza will take just a minute to cook; an oral physiologist approved the burger's width; and nothing on the menu will have a turnaround time longer than 11 minutes…so that travelers can actually sit down and enjoy a meal before takeoff.
