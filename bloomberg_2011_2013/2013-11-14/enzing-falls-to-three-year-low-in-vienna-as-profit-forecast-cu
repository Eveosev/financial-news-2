Lenzing AG (LNZ) , an Austrian cellulose-fiber maker, fell to a three-year low in Vienna after cutting
its profit forecast and announcing job cuts on weak prices.  The  company  dropped as much as 10 percent to 46.60 euros in
the city, the lowest level since September 2010. Trading volume
was more than seven times the three-month daily average.  Earnings before interest and taxes for the year will be 75
million euros ($100 million) to 85 million euros, Lenzing said
in a statement late yesterday, down from an earlier forecast of
160 million euros. It will cut costs by 120 million euros a year
from 2015, partly by reducing its staff of 6,772 by about 600.  “This is a big shock,” Stephan Trubrich, an analyst in
Vienna at Kepler Cheuvreux who put his hold-rating on the stock
under review today, said by phone. “It’s not clear yet what
depreciations and one-offs there will be” from cost cutting.  Nine-month Ebit was 136.4 million euros, suggesting a
fourth-quarter loss of 51.4 million to 61.4 million euros.  Lenzing faces competition from producers of cotton, which
fell 16 percent to 78.1 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York  since reaching a 16-month closing high of 93.32 cents on
Aug. 16. Cotton prices will drop further to 69.5 cents in a
year, according to the median of 12 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Lenzing blamed high levels of cotton inventories
as having “unfavorable effects on the entire fiber industry”
as world output exceeds demand for a fourth straight year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
