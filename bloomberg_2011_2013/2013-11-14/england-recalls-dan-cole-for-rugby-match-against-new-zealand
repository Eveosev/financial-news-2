England  rugby coach Stuart Lancaster
recalled prop Dan Cole for the match against top-ranked New
Zealand at Twickenham in two days.  Cole’s return in place of David Wilson is the only change
to the starting line-up in the 31-12 win over Argentina last
weekend.  The All Blacks named winger Julian Savea to replace Cory
Jane after the 26-19 win over  France . Fly-half Dan Carter is set
to win his 100th Test cap as New Zealand aims to reverse last
December’s surprise 38-21 defeat to England, now third in the
International Rugby Board rankings.  The visitors are also seeking to maintain their 100 percent
record in 2013 after being unbeaten since that loss at
Twickenham.  England: Mike Brown, Chris Ashton, Joel Tomkins, Billy
