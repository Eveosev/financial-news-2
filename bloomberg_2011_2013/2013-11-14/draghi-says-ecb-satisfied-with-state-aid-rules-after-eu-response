European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said the European Commission has addressed the
ECB’s concerns about new rules that would require junior
bondholder losses at banks that receive state aid.  “We are satisfied with the clarifications provided by the
commission, whereby the state-aid rules should be applied with a
view to safeguarding financial stability and also the level
playing field,” Draghi told reporters in Brussels today.  The Frankfurt-based central bank had asked the European
Commission to clarify the new rules so that regulators could
order technically solvent banks to strengthen their balance
sheets without scaring off investors. Draghi raised the concerns
in a July 30 letter to EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia , reported by  Bloomberg News  in October.  European finance ministers meeting today and tomorrow will
debate what backstops should be put in place should the ECB
decide that individual banks need more capital after a series of
assessments next year. The ECB is conducting the reviews as it
prepares to take over the currency bloc’s financial supervision.  Speaking in  London  this week, Almunia said shareholders and
junior creditors will have to contribute to filling capital
shortfalls that are discovered in next year’s reviews. At the
same time, he said, “if financial stability were at risk, the
new rules provide for an exception clause” that would allow
public backstops to step in before any creditor losses were
assigned.  Draghi today said “the discussion is closed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
