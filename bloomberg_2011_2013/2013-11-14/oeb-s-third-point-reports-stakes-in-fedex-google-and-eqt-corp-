Third Point LLC, the hedge-fund firm
run by  Daniel Loeb , acquired new stakes in  FedEx Corp. (FDX) ,  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  and EQT Corp. in the third quarter, according to a
regulatory filing.  Loeb bought 2 million shares of Memphis, Tennessee-based
FedEx valued at $228.2 million at the end of September,
according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Third Point, based in New York, also
reported that it held 110,000 of Google’s A shares valued at
$96.4 million and 1 million shares of energy company EQT Corp.
valued at $88.7 million  Loeb, whose hedge-fund firm seeks changes at companies
including Sony Corp. and  Sotheby’s (BID) , said Nov. 12 that he won’t
push for the ouster of FedEx’s Chief Executive Officer  Fred
Smith  and that he likes the global courier’s business. Third
Point has efforts under way to replace the CEO of Sotheby’s and
spurred the resignation of Yahoo! Inc. CEO Scott Thompson.  Third Point sold 46 million shares of Sunnyvale,
California-based Yahoo in the quarter. Yahoo remained its
largest holding by market value with 16 million shares valued at
$530.7 million. Third Point added 3.65 million shares of New
York-based Sotheby’s. Third Point holds 6.35 million shares of
the auctioneer, according to an Oct. 2 regulatory filing.  Elissa Doyle, a spokeswoman for Third Point, declined to
comment on the holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
