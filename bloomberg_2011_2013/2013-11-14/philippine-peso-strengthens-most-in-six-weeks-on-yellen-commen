The Philippine peso rose the most in
six weeks after Federal Reserve chairman nominee  Janet Yellen 
said the  U.S. economy  must improve before stimulus can be cut.  Unemployment is “still too high, reflecting a labor market
and economy performing far short of their potential”, Yellen,
the Fed’s vice chairman, said yesterday. An Oct. 17-18 survey of
economists by Bloomberg predicted the Fed will delay tapering
asset purchases until March. Eastspring Investments bought
Philippine sovereign bonds recently, betting the peso will
outperform its peers, Fixed-Income Investment Director Guan Yi Low said in a Nov. 12 interview.  The peso advanced 0.5 percent, the most since Oct. 3, to
43.535 per dollar as of 10:30 a.m. in Manila, after climbing 0.1
percent yesterday, according to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 6.16 percent. The Bloomberg Dollar
Index, which tracks the greenback against 10 major counterparts,
fell 0.5 percent in the past two days.  “The dollar weakened overnight in response to Yellen’s
statement,” which “was more dovish than expectations,” said
 Prakriti Sofat , a Singapore-based economist at Barclays Plc.  The yield on the government’s 8 percent notes due July 2031
fell five basis points to 4.3 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
