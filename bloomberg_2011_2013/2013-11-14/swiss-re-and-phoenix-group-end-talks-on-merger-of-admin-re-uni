Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN)  and  Phoenix Group
Holdings (PHNX)  said talks about a merger of the world’s second biggest
reinsurer’s Admin Re unit with the U.K.’s largest manager of
life insurance funds have ended.  “The parties have been unable to agree the terms on which
a mutually acceptable transaction could take place,” the
companies said in separate  statements  late yesterday. Phoenix
and Swiss Re  said in July  they were holding preliminary talks.  Swiss Re said earlier this year that it had “work to do”
in relation to Admin Re, a unit that manages so-called closed
life insurance funds, mainly in the U.K., and no longer sells
new contracts. The Zurich-based reinsurer wants to strengthen
operational efficiency in the business, according to a
presentation on its website.  “Admin Re will continue to execute against its business
plan, further streamlining its business through management
actions targeted at productivity measures and asset re-balancing,” Swiss Re said in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
