Maria Sharapova  is joining NBC
Sports as a correspondent reporting on the 2014 Winter Olympics
in her hometown, Forbes magazine said.  Sharapova, 26, won a silver medal for  Russia  in women’s
singles at last year’s London Olympics. She has won each of
tennis’ four annual Grand Slam tournaments and currently is
ranked No. 4 in the world.  Sharapova was born in Siberia and moved with her family to
Sochi when she was two. Four years later, she emigrated to the
U.S. The Winter Olympics will be held in Sochi from Feb. 7-23.  “As an Olympian, it means so much to me for this year’s
 Olympic Games  to be hosted in my hometown of Sochi,” she was
quoted as saying by Forbes. “Sochi has such rich culture and
history, that I’m looking forward to sharing that with the world
through being a part of the NBC family.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
