Kenneth Heebner’s Capital Growth
Management LP took a new position in Toll Brothers Inc. last
quarter after selling out of it in the previous period, while
exiting a stake in Hertz Global Holdings Inc.  The Boston-based firm purchased 6.3 million shares, worth
$203.3 million, in the largest U.S. luxury-home builder during
the three months ended Sept. 30, according to a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission released today. Heebner had
sold out of his $21.6 million stake in Toll Brothers in the
three months ended June 30.  The  fund manager , who ranked as America’s No. 1 stock
picker before the financial crisis snapped his winning streak,
also took a stake in building-products maker Mohawk Industries
Inc., worth $106.8 million at the end of September. He added 2.2
million shares to his position in  Morgan Stanley (MS) , the largest in
his portfolio at $353 million.  Capital Growth sold 4.3 million shares of Hertz, which has
rallied 47 percent this year, and 5.9 million shares of
homebuilder PulteGroup Inc., according to the filing.  Toll accounted for 5.5 percent of the total market value of
the firm’s holdings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company agreed on Nov. 6 to buy
Shapell Industries Inc.’s homebuilding business for about $1.6
billion, more than doubling the number of California lots it
controls.  Heebner’s  CGM Focus Fund (CGMFX)  has  returned  27 percent so far
this year, beating half of its peers, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
