Royal Dutch Shell Plc failed to sell
North Sea Oseberg crude, while no bids or offers were made for
Forties or Russian Urals blend.  Shipments of Iraqi crude will be reduced by an estimated
200,000 to 250,000 barrels a day due to export bottlenecks until
the end of the first quarter, according to the International
Energy Agency’s monthly report.  North Sea  Shell didn’t manage to sell Oseberg for Nov. 27 to Nov. 30
loading at a premium of 80 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window showed. That compares to the Dutch company’s bid
for the grade at plus 85 cents on Nov. 8.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA offered a Nov. 29 to Dec. 1
cargo of Ekofisk for a fourth day without finding a buyer. The
company’s offer was unchanged from yesterday at a premium of 90
cents to Dated Brent.  Brent for December settlement traded at $108.58 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $107.10 in the previous session. The January
contract was at $108.33, a discount of 25 cents to December.  ST Shipping, Glencore Xstrata Plc’s freight unit, booked
the very large crude carrier Al Jabriyah II to load crude on
Dec. 15 at Hound Point,  Scotland  to South Korea, according to
three shipbroker reports including Optima Shipbrokers Ltd.
Charles Watenphul, a London-based spokesman for Glencore,
declined to comment by phone.  Urals/Mediterranean  Gunvor Group Ltd. didn’t manage to buy 85,000 tons of CPC
blend for Dec. 5 to Dec. 9 loading at a premium of 95 cents to
Dated Brent delivered to Augusta,  Italy . The company bid for the
grade at the same level yesterday.  Two positions for Urals loading Nov. 9 to Nov. 10 and Nov.
14 to Nov. 15 have not been filled, said two traders who
participate in the market, asking not to be identified because
the information is confidential. A third free position at the
Baltic port of Primorsk was filled last week by OAO
Surgutneftegas, while an extra cargo for Nov. 24 to Nov. 25,
owned by OAO Rosneft, was added to the loading program.  Four 600,000-barrel cargoes of Azeri Light crude are
scheduled to load in December from  Georgia ’s Black Sea port of
Supsa, unchanged from November, a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News shows.  West Africa  Angolan loading programs for January are expected to be
released tomorrow or Nov. 18.  Thailand ’s PTT Pcl’s tender to buy 600,000 to 1 million
barrels of sweet or sour crude for Jan. 1 to Jan. 5 delivery to
Rayong closed yesterday at 12 p.m. Singapore time, according to
a document obtained by Bloomberg News. Offers were valid until 6
p.m. today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
