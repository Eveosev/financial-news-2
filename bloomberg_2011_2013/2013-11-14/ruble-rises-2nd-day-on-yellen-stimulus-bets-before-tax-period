The ruble and  government bonds  rose
after Federal Reserve chairman nominee  Janet Yellen  signaled
stimulus will be maintained, boosting appetite for riskier
emerging-market assets.  The ruble strengthened 0.2 percent to 37.7712 against  Bank
Rossii’s target dollar-euro basket  by 1:19 p.m. in Moscow. The
yield on government bonds due February 2027 declined four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.79 percent.  Yellen, the Fed’s vice chairman, yesterday voiced her
commitment to using bond purchases known as quantitative easing
to boost growth and lower unemployment that remains above 7
percent more than four years after the economy began to recover.
The regular tax period, when Russian companies pay ruble-denominated taxes, starts tomorrow with payments to insurance
and pension funds.  It’s only “a matter of time” before the ruble advances to
37.50 against the basket as the tax period “increases its
importance in the coming week,” Evgeny Koshelev, an analyst at
OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) , said in e-mailed comments.  Oil advanced 0.3 percent to $107.41 a barrel in  London ,
extending a 1.2 percent gain yesterday. An index of the 20 most
actively-traded emerging-market currencies added 0.1 percent to
92.7059, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The ruble strengthened 0.2 percent against the dollar to
32.6820 and traded up 0.3 percent versus the euro at 43.9890.  To contact the reporter on this story:
