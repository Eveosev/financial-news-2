The Asset Management Corp. of
 Nigeria , which nationalized three banks and took on the bad
debts of others to save the banking system, said liabilities
surged last year to 3.2 trillion naira ($20 billion).  Net liabilities rose from 2.4 trillion naira a year
earlier, Kayode Lambo, spokesman for the Lagos-based bad bank
said in an e-mailed statement, without giving a reason for the
increase. Amcon’s net loss for last year was 791.7 billion
naira, compared with 2.4 trillion naira a year earlier.  Africa ’s top oil producer established Amcon in 2010 as part
of measures to save its banking industry from collapse as
lenders reeled from bad loans to stock speculators and fuel
importers after the global financial crisis in 2008. The  Central
Bank of Nigeria  fired the chief executive officers of eight
lenders and bailed them out with 620 billion naira.  Amcon sold bonds to fund the purchase of bad debts and took
over three of the rescued banks after regulators said they were
unlikely to meet a recapitalization deadline. Lenders are
required to contribute part of their earnings to a fund aimed at
paying for the bonds.  Amcon’s liabilities increased because of higher mark-to-market losses in the assets of the corporation, Pabina Yinkere,
head of research at Lagos-based Vetiva Capital Management Ltd.,
said by phone today.  “Loan recoveries and interest earned on bonds issued in
2011 contributed to decline in net losses,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
