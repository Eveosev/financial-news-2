U.S. regulators may relax some auto-safety requirements on manufacturers that voluntarily install
technology preventing cars from starting unless occupants are
wearing seat belts.  Cars featuring so-called interlock devices would be given
relief on strict U.S. design requirements to prevent injuries to
unbelted passengers, National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration chief  David Strickland  said in a call with
reporters today.  “There are lots of reasons a manufacturer would find it
advantageous to go the voluntary route,” Strickland said.  Seat-belt interlock technology has been around for decades.
An earlier attempt to mandate the systems, in the 1970s, was so
unpopular that a law was passed banning their installation.  A surface-transportation law passed last year is allowing
NHTSA to consider allowing vehicle manufacturers to count
interlocks toward satisfying crash-test requirements, the agency
said in a statement today. NHTSA is looking at ways to make the
systems tamper-proof and reliable.  If there were a way to guarantee that all people in the car
were wearing seat belts, automakers might be able to remove some
structural steel, Strickland said. That would help the industry
in other ways, such as improving fuel economy.  Automakers have expressed a lot of interest in the idea,
Strickland said. The car redesigns wouldn’t result in a lower
degree of safety, he said.  “We have all the confidence that there won’t be
backsliding,” Strickland said. “I feel very bullish about the
engineering on this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
