U.K. stocks  advanced after Janet
Yellen, nominated to be the next chairman of the Federal
Reserve, said the U.S. economy must improve before the central
bank pares monetary stimulus.  Prudential Plc, Britain’s biggest insurer by market value,
climbed 1.6 percent after saying nine-month sales rose 6
percent.  Burberry (BRBY)  Group Plc rose 0.6 percent after reporting
first-half earnings.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 53.93 points, or 0.8 percent, to
6,683.93 at 8:58 a.m. in London, rebounding from a 1.4 percent
loss yesterday. The benchmark has rallied 13 percent this year
as central banks around the world commit to maintain monetary
stimulus to nurture economic growth. The broader  FTSE All-Share
Index (ASX)  increased 0.8 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
advanced 0.5 percent.  In testimony prepared for her nomination hearing before the
Senate Banking Committee, Yellen said the economy and labor
market are performing “far short of their potential” and must
improve before the central bank can begin reducing its bond
purchases.  Prudential (PRU)  rose 1.6 percent to 1,263 pence. The London-based insurer said sales in the period to Sept. 30 this year
advanced as gains in the U.S. and Asian markets offset a decline
in the U.K.  Revenue climbed to 3.27 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) from
3.08 billion pounds in the year-earlier period, the company
said. That met the 3.26 billion-pound average estimate of 18
analysts surveyed by the company.  Burberry added 1.1 percent to 1,478 pence. The U.K.’s
largest luxury-goods maker reported little changed first-half
earnings as the start-up of its own beauty business and weaker
wholesale revenue offset growth in retail sales.  Adjusted pretax profit for the six months ended Sept. 30
was 173.9 million pounds compared with 173.4 million pounds a
year earlier, the London-based trenchcoat maker said today, less
than a month after forecasting that the earnings would be around
last year’s level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
