Canada ’s  merchandise trade  deficit
narrowed more than economists forecast in September as crude oil
shipments led exports to the highest in almost two years.  The deficit of C$435 million ($414 million) followed a
revised shortfall of C$1.09 billion in August, Statistics Canada
said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
a C$1 billion deficit, based on the median of 19 forecasts.  Canada’s 21st straight shortfall extends the longest streak
in at least a quarter century, underlining weak foreign demand
that’s curtailed business investment. Net exports will subtract
0.1 percentage points from growth this year, the  Bank of Canada 
said in its October Monetary Policy Report.  “This month itself was encouraging,” said  Mark Chandler ,
head of fixed income research at  RBC Capital Markets . “You can
certainly make the point we have a decent jumping off point for
the fourth quarter.”  Canada averaged trade deficits of C$920 million in the
three months ended September, the highest quarterly gap since
the end of the third quarter of 2012.  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.5 percent to $1.0505 per
 U.S. dollar  at 10:57 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys
95.19 U.S. cents.  Crude Shipments  Exports rose 1.8 percent to C$40.6 billion in September,
the highest since December 2011, Statistics Canada said. Crude
oil and crude bitumen shipments rose to a record C$7.3 billion,
and exports of aircraft and other transportation equipment rose
17.4 percent to C$1.6 billion.  Imports rose 0.2 percent to C$41.1 billion,  Statistics
Canada  said.  The volume of exports advanced 1.7 percent and import
volumes fell 0.2 percent, Statistics Canada said. Volume figures
adjust for price changes and can be a better indicator of how
trade contributes to economic growth.  The  surplus with the U.S.  widened to C$4.30 billion in
September from C$4.22 billion a month earlier. Exports make up
about one-third of Canada’s economy, with about 75 percent of
the shipments going to the U.S.  “Uncertain global and domestic economic conditions are
delaying the pick-up in exports and business investment, leaving
the level of economic activity lower than the Bank had been
expecting,” the Bank of Canada said in its Oct. 23 decision to
keep its key  interest rate  at 1 percent.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said Canada’s new
 home price index  was unchanged in September after a 0.1 percent
gain in August. It was the first time the index failed to rise
since March 2011. Prices rose 0.5 percent in Calgary and
declined 0.4 percent in  Edmonton , Alberta’s provincial capital,
the largest drop since June 2009.  Economists predicted the index would advance 0.l percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey  with
eight responses.  From a year earlier, new  home prices  increased 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
