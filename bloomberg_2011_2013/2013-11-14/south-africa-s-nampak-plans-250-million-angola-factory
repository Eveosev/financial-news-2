Nampak Ltd. (NPK) , a South African
packaging company, said it’s planning a $250 million drinks
container plant in   Angola  as part of an expansion outside its
domestic market.  “As the largest packaging company in South Africa we’re
constantly looking for opportunities outside of the country,”
Tim Leaf-Wright, general manager of Nampak Angola unit Angolata,
told reporters in Luanda, the capital. “We’re really focusing
on Nigeria and Angola at this time.”  The company, which earned 13 percent of its revenue from
its African operations outside South Africa during the six
months through March, is growing its business in the continent’s
faster-growing economies. Nampak has previously manufactured
cans in Angola, Africa’s second-biggest oil producer, for
world’s largest drinks company  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , Leaf-Wright said.
Investment in the new plant will “probably be in the region of
$250 million,” he said.  Pedro Coelho, Angola head of  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) ,
Africa’s biggest lender, said Nampak was still arranging
financing for the plant and that the Johannesburg-based company
was bidding to be the lead bank on the project.  “Angola is the third-largest economy in Africa,” Coelho
said. “If a company wants to be in sub-Saharan Africa, it needs
to be in Angola.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
