Tudor Investment Corp., the $13
billion hedge-fund firm run by billionaire  Paul Tudor Jones ,
increased its stake in an exchange-traded fund that tracks
retail companies in the third quarter.  The firm bought 3.6 million shares of  Consumer
Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) , boosting its investment
to 4.1 million shares valued at $250 million as of Sept. 30,
according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  The ETF, which has rallied 36 percent this year, is Tudor’s
largest U.S.-listed stock holding. Tudor, based in Greenwich,
Connecticut, is a macro investor that seeks to profit from
macroeconomic trends by trading everything from bonds to
currencies.  Tudor also purchased 2.8 million shares in  iShares MSCI
Emerging Markets ETF  in the latest quarter, taking a stake
valued at about $115 million as of Sept. 30, the firm’s second-largest holding. It also initiated a holding in Cupertino,
California-based Apple Inc.  Tudor sold off its holdings in  Financial Select Sector SPDR
Fund (XLF) , Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund and  Energy Select
Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) , all ETFs. ETFs are baskets of securities,
typically tracking an index, that trade on an exchange like
stocks.  Patrick Clifford , a spokesman for Tudor at Abernathy
McGregor, declined to comment on the firm’s filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
