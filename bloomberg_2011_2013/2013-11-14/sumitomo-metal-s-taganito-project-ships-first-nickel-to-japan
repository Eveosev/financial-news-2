Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. (5713) ,  Japan ’s
top nickel producer, said its Taganito nickel project in the
Philippines shipped the first shipment to Japan in late October
and is heading for full production from January.  The shipment carrying the equivalent of 1,200 metric tons
of refined nickel arrived on Nov. 1 at the company’s Niihama
refinery in Ehime prefecture in western Japan, company president
Yoshiaki Nakazato said today in an investor meeting.  Sumitomo Metal  said it will produce 30,000 tons of nickel
in 2014 and 36,000 tons in 2016. Indonesia’s proposed ore export
ban to promote domestic processing may affect the company’s
ferro nickel production at its Hyuga smelter in Miyazaki
prefecture in western Japan, which secures 40 percent of its raw
material from the Southeast Asian nation, he said.  “If the ban happens, we will try to increase purchases
from the  Philippines  and New Caledonia,” Nakazato said.
Indonesia’s scheduled export ban will have an impact on nickel
prices in coming months, he said.  Nickel on the London Metal Exchanged has dropped 19 percent
this year, the worst performer among six base metals traded on
the bourse, and was at $13,820 a ton at 2:05 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
