Janet Yellen , the nominee for
chairman of the  Federal Reserve , said the central bank should
first try to stop asset bubbles through regulatory policy and
only raise  interest rates  as a last resort.  “I would not rule out using monetary policy as a tool to
address asset-price misalignments, but because it’s a blunt tool
and because Congress has asked us to use those tools to achieve
the goals of maximum employment and price stability, I would
like to see monetary policy directed toward achieving those
goals Congress has given us,” Yellen said today during her
confirmation hearing. Supervisory tools should be the “first
line of defense,” she said.  Yellen, the Fed’s vice chairman, said that she doesn’t see
evidence of asset bubbles that threaten the rest of the economy.  “By and large, I would say that I don’t see evidence at
this point in major sectors of asset price misalignments, at
least of a level that would threaten financial instability,”
she said in today’s testimony in  Washington .  “Stock prices have risen pretty robustly but if you look
at traditional measures,” such as price-earnings ratios, “you
would not see stock prices in territory that suggests bubble-like conditions,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
