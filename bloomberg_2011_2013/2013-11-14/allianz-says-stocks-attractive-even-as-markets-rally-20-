Allianz SE (ALV) ,  Europe ’s biggest
insurer, said equities are a good investment even after the MSCI
World Index rallied 20 percent this year, executive board member
Maximilian Zimmerer said.  “Equities are fundamentally very attractive,” Zimmerer,
55, who is in charge of investments for Allianz, told reporters
in  Frankfurt  today. “We were more optimistic about equities at
the beginning of the year, we expanded the position and actively
bought.”  Allianz, which owns Pacific Investment Management Co., is
among insurers that saw their investment options narrow as
monetary policy makers pushed down bond yields to record lows to
stimulate the economy.  Insurance companies  were Europe’s biggest
institutional investors with 8.4 trillion euros ($11.3 trillion)
under management in 2012.  German government debt, known as bunds, is expensive given
the difference in yield to bonds issued by other European
states, Zimmerer said.  Allianz, whose 30 asset management companies oversee 533
billion euros, invested in about 2 billion euros of equities in
the first nine months of the year, according to an e-mailed
statement by the Munich-based company.  Real estate remains an attractive investment when compared
with fixed income, Zimmerer said.  Insurers on the Stoxx Europe 600 Insurance index climbed 24
percent this year, led by  Swiss Life Holding AG. (SLHN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
