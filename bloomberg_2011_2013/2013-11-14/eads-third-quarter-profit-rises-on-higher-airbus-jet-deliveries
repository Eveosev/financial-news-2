European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. posted a 26 percent increase in third-quarter profit after
its Airbus SAS unit delivered more commercial aircraft.  Earnings before interest and tax, goodwill impairment and
exceptionals rose to 663 million euros ($893 million) from 526
million euros a year earlier, as sales grew 11 percent to 13.63
billion euros. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had predicted 664
million euros in profit. EADS cut its cash-flow outlook.  “We achieved good improvement in revenues and
profitability over the first nine months thanks largely to our
civil aircraft business” Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders 
said in an e-mailed statement.  Airbus, which contributes more than two thirds of revenue
and the majority of profit, delivered 504 planes through the end
of October. EADS lifted the year-end delivery goal to 620 planes
from “more than 600.” It generated 1,215 net orders in the
first 10 months, surpassing a goal of 1,200, and will probably
attract further deals at the Dubai Air show starting Nov. 17.  EADS revised its free cash flow guidance for the end of
2013 to negative 1.5 billion euros from break-even, saying it’s
incurring higher development costs and feeling the impact from
government budget constraints.  Airbus contributed 409 million euros to earnings, up from
281 million euros a year earlier as its sales rose 15 percent to
9.85 billion euros. The company maintained its outlook for Ebit
before one-time items of 3.5 billion euros and earnings per
share of about 2.50 euros, prior to a share buyback.  EADS will change its name to Airbus after January to
benefit from the prominence of that brand in aerospace, and will
combine its defense and space businesses into one unit. That
move is designed to help the company present its military and
space products in international markets and tackle costs.  Costs associated with the change will be reviewed in the
fourth quarter, EADS said. The company’s three businesses will
now be known as Airbus, Airbus Defence & Space, and Airbus
Helicopters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
