European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. cut its free cash outlook for the full year as it spends
more on aircraft programs including the A350 and said it may
need to review output of its A380 superjumbo amid slack demand.  The parent of Airbus SAS predicted a 1.5 billion euro ($2
billion) cash outflow instead of breakeven, as it reported
third-quarter earnings. If Airbus doesn’t find customers by
year’s end to fill A380 delivery slots for 2015 it may be forced
to trim production below the 30 units needed to pull the program
from deficit, Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said.  Airbus has struggled to turn the biggest commercial
airliner into a financial success, with no firm order so far
booked this year and  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  canceling some units.
While Airbus may pick up deals at the Dubai Air Show starting
next week, the double-decker aircraft remains a niche product,
as carriers instead turn to more fuel-efficient twin-engine
models such as the A350 or  Boeing Co. (BA)  777.  “The change in cash-flow guidance was a bit worse than we
expected,” said  Yan Derocles , an analyst at Oddo Securities in
Paris, who has a “buy” rating on the shares.  EADS rose as much as 1.44 euros, or 2.8 percent, to 53.2
euros in Paris, after falling as much as 2 percent in earlier
trading. The stock has gained 79 percent this year.  Major Challenges  Earnings before interest and tax, goodwill impairment and
exceptionals rose to 663 million euros from 526 million euros a
year earlier, as sales grew 11 percent to 13.63 billion euros.
Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had predicted 664 million euros
in profit. EADS raised its outlook for Airbus plane deliveries
this year to 620 from an earlier target of more than 600.  “We have significant challenges ahead of us, particularly
with respect to cash generation” and to the A350 program, which
has entered the next critical phase, Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders  said in an e-mailed statement.  Airbus first flew the A350 wide-body aircraft in June with
the second of five test planes joining the flight trials phase
last month. EADS said today that the program remains
“challenging” as it seeks to deliver the first jet to Qatar
Airways Ltd. in the second half of next year. Any changes in the
development may hurt earnings, it said.  A350 Costs   Costs on the A350 have risen as test planes fly more and
Airbus has spent more to assure greater maturity for prototype
jets, Wilhelm said. The costs for early customer aircraft are
also creeping up and will be closely monitored, he said.  Airbus expects to break even on the A350 wide-body before
2020, Wilhelm said. The production rate will reach 10 a month by
the end of 2018. Two thirds of the 1.5 billion cash outflow is
related to higher spending on programs including the A350 and
military activities including the A400M transport, he said.  Airbus also is working on “a number of campaigns” to fill
open A380 production slots, he said. The backlog from 2018 needs
to be built up, with 2016 and 2017 in decent shape, he said.
Competition is “tough” both from Airbus’s own A350-1000 long-range jet and the 777X Boeing is marketing, Wilhelm said.  Tough Competition  The Chicago-based planemaker has cut output on the 747-8
jumbo twice this year amid weak demand as Boeing curtails
production to 1.5 aircraft each month through 2015. Wilhelm said
the A380 is in a different category and will avoid the 747-8’s
fate.  Even if production falls short of 30 aircraft a year it
“would not translate into a financial disaster,” Wilhelm said,
as Airbus plans to deliver 30 A380s next year.  Airbus, which contributes more than two-thirds of EADS
revenue and the majority of profit, delivered 504 planes through
the end of October and generated 1,215 net orders in the first
10 months, surpassing a goal of 1,200.  EADS also attributed the revision in its cash outlook to
the impact of government budget constraints. Only one more A400
military transport will be handed over this year after the
French  air force  took delivery of the first two planes, EADS
said. It previously forecast four of the turbo-propeller
aircraft going to clients and said the change in plan was being
made “in agreement with customers.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
