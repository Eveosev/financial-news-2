This Nov. 10 NASA satellite photo shows an iceberg the size of Singapore parting ways with the Pine Island Glacier, on the western end of Antarctica. Scientists first noticed a break in the ice about two years ago. The section broke off on July 10 and remained more or less in place, before moving out to sea this week.
