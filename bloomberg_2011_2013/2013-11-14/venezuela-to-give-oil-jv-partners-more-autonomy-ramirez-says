Venezuela  will give foreign partners
in heavy oil joint ventures more autonomy in hopes of boosting
production from today’s 1.2 million barrels per day to 4 million
barrels per day by 2019.  Foreign companies operating in the Orinoco heavy-oil belt
will have more autonomy to make decisions on investments and
operations, Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez told
reporters today in Caracas. Ramirez, who also serves as
president of state-owned oil company PDVSA, wants partners to
assume a more active role.  “If companies have the capacity to bring in additional
rigs for the joint ventures, we have no problem,” Ramirez said.  Venezuela’s Orinoco heavy-oil belt, also known as the Faja,
contains estimated oil reserves of 1.36 billion barrels.  “We’re looking to reduce bottlenecks while optimizing and
increasing the capacity of our existing upgraders,” Ramirez
said. “We also expect to achieve early production of at least
50,000 barrels per day as the production from our upgraders has
reached a maximum.”  Venezuela plans to invest nearly $200 billion in the Faja
in two phases, Ramirez said. PDVSA will invest $24 billion
through 2016 to expand existing upgraders and another $108
billion after 2016 on new upgraders and infrastructure, he said.
The rest of the money will be dedicated to drilling wells and
other underground operations.  Venezuela will invest $26 billion next year to boost total
production to at least 3.3 million barrels a day, Ramirez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
