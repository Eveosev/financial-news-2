Robusta coffee declined to the
lowest level in almost a week in London on speculation farmers
in  Vietnam , the top producer of the variety used in instant
drinks, will start selling as the harvest advances. Sugar fell.  Vietnam will produce a record 29 million bags of coffee in
the 2013-14 season started there last month, estimates  Kona Haque , a London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. As the
harvest advances, Vietnamese prices fell to 29,600 dong ($1.40)
a kilogram (2.2 pounds) on Nov. 7, the lowest since 2010,  data 
from the Daklak Trade & Tourism Center on Bloomberg showed.  “Any rally in London will encounter Vietnam selling as the
harvest advances,” Alex Parry, a broker at  ABN Amro , said by e-mail today. “The Vietnamese would definitely start selling if
the market rallied $80 to $100 a ton and that will offer quite a
large amount of resistance, which offers some reassurance to the
managed shorts.”  Robusta coffee for January delivery slid 0.7 percent to
$1,455 a metric ton by 11:25 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . The
price touched $1,454 a ton, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Nov. 8. Arabica coffee for March delivery fell
0.2 percent to $1.057 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Robusta coffee fell 24 percent this year, while the arabica
variety slid 27 percent and is heading for a third year of
losses, the longest slump since 1993. Global coffee supplies
will be 8.7 million tons higher than demand in 2013-14, with a
surplus of 6.4 million tons of arabica and 2.4 million tons of
robusta, Macquarie estimated in a Nov. 11 report.  Biggest Bet  Money managers held the biggest bet on lower robusta coffee
prices since 2012, NYSE Liffe  data  compiled by Bloomberg showed.

10,593 futures and options in the week ended Nov. 5.  Refined, or white, sugar for delivery in March was down 0.2
percent to $470.20 a ton on NYSE Liffe. The December futures,

group Conadesuca said in its first estimate for the crop. That
compares with 6.97 million tons a year earlier.  Cocoa for delivery in March fell 0.3 percent to 1,703
