U.S. sales of video-game products
rose 4.7 percent to $791.1 million in October, a third straight
monthly gain ahead of this month’s release of new consoles from
 Sony Corp. (6758)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   Software sales increased 12 percent to $482.5 million, from
$432.6 million year earlier, NPD Group Inc., the  Port
Washington , New York-based researcher, said today in an e-mail.
That countered an 8.4 percent decline in hardware sales as
shoppers held back to await the new consoles.  Sony’s $399 PlayStation 4 goes on sale tomorrow in the
U.S., and Microsoft’s $499 Xbox One follows on Nov. 22, their
first upgrades in more than six years. Both companies are
offering machines with upgraded graphics and more entertainment
tie-ins, betting they will entice enthusiasts and casual gamers.  October video-game sales were led “Grand Theft Auto V”
from  Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO) , NPD said.  Sales of video-game accessories increased about 1 percent
to $136.9 million.  Nintendo Co. said in a statement its 3DS player was the
best-selling video-game hardware system for the month, with more
than 452,000 units sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
