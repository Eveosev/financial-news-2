Copper rose for the first time in
three days after  Janet Yellen , nominated to be the next chairman
of the  Federal Reserve , said the  U.S. economy  and labor market
must improve before the Fed can begin reducing stimulus.  The contract for delivery in three months on the London
Metal Exchange rose as much 0.6 percent to $7,024 a metric ton,
and traded at $7,014.25 at 10:28 a.m. in Beijing. The metal
rebounded from a 2 percent decline yesterday, the most since
Oct. 23.  “Yellen’s comments signal that we still have a way to go
before the Fed begins tapering stimulus, which is positive for
metals,” analyst Ye Fengwei at Wanda Futures Co. said from
Urumqi.  Copper for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.2 percent to 50,510  yuan  ($8,291) a ton. Futures
for delivery in March gained 0.5 percent to $3.187 a pound on
the Comex in New York.  On the LME, lead, tin, zinc and nickel also rose, while
aluminum was little changed. Tin hadn’t traded.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
