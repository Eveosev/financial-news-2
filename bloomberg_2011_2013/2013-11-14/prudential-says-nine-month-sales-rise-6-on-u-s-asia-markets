Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer by market value, posted better-than-expected new
business profit, boosted by “double-digit” sales growth in six
South-East Asian markets. The shares climbed.  Profit from new business rose 12 percent to 1.95 billion
pounds ($3.1 billion) in the nine months to Sept. 30, the
London-based insurer said today in a statement. That beat the
1.9 billion-pound estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by the
company. New business profit in Asia jumped 20 percent, while
sales in the region increased 15 percent.  “We remain on track to achieve our 2013 growth and cash
objectives,” Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam said in a
conference call with reporters in London today. “The central
point for Prudential is the long term structural trends in Asia
remain intact.”  Prudential, which gets almost half its revenue from Asia,
has more than doubled in  London  trading since Thiam took charge
in 2009, as markets rebounded after the financial crisis and the
insurer expanded into Asia. The stock rose 1.9 percent to 1,266
pence, its biggest gain since Oct. 18.  The company said its rise in sales in Asia has been broad
based as it reported an increase of at least 10 percent in its
“sweet-spot markets,” including Hong Kong. It also said it
remains on target to achieve its last Asian-growth objective of
doubling 2009 new business profit to 1.4 billion pounds by the
end of this year.  Total sales for the nine months increased 6 percent to 3.27
billion pounds, in line with the 3.26 billion-pound average
analyst estimate in the survey. Sales in its U.S. business,
climbed 6 percent to 1.2 billion pounds, while the U.K. fell 12
percent to 540 million pounds.  Thiam said Prudential’s investment unit provided a “huge
contribution” to earnings with M&G reporting net inflows of 8.9
billion pounds in the nine-month period. Third party funds under
management climbed 19 percent to a record 124 billion pounds
from the year-earlier period.  Prudential Plc has no relation to Newark, New Jersey-based
