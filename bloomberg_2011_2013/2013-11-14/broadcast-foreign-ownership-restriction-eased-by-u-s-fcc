The Federal Communications
Commission said it would consider approving transactions that
increase foreign ownership of U.S. broadcasters, a move sought
by companies that said it would boost investment.  The agency on a 5-to-0 vote at its monthly meeting in
 Washington  today said it would examine on a case-by-case basis
deals that raise the share of foreign ownership above 25
percent.  Such transactions had faced a de facto ban, Commissioner
Ajit Pai, a Republican, said in a statement urging the agency to
act. The restriction doesn’t apply to non-broadcasters such as
cable, satellite and Internet operators, Pai said.  The FCC already has the power to consider deals that exceed
the 25 percent threshold, and a clarification lets the
marketplace know such deals aren’t forbidden, a group including
 CBS Corp. (CBS) ,  Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. (SBGI)  and the Walt Disney
Co., which owns ABC, said in a letter to the agency.  Granting the request “would help inject vital investment
capital into the broadcast industry,” the  National Association
of Broadcasters , a Washington-based trade group, said in a
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
