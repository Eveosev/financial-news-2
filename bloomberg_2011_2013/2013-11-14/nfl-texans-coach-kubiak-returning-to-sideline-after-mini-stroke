Houston coach Gary Kubiak, who
missed one game while recovering from a mini-stroke, said he
will return to the sideline Nov. 17 when the Texans try to break
a franchise-record seven-game losing streak.  Kubiak, 52, collapsed on the field at halftime in the
Texans’ loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Nov. 3.  “It just feels great to be back,” Kubiak told reporters
yesterday in his first public remarks since returning to the
team two days earlier. “You have a true appreciation for the
opportunity that you have and the opportunity to be around the
players.”  The Texans began the season with two victories before
losing seven straight. This weekend they host the Oakland
Raiders, who are 3-6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
