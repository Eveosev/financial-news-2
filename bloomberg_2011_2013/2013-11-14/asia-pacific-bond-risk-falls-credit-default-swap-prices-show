The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment shrank, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 3 basis points to
104 basis points as of 11:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark is set for its
biggest one-day decrease since Oct. 17, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 2 basis points to 138 as of 8:19
a.m. in Singapore, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
prices show. The measure is poised for its biggest daily decline
since Oct. 30, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1 basis point to 88.75
basis points as of 9:16 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The gauge has ranged from 74 to 148.1 this year, CMA data
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
