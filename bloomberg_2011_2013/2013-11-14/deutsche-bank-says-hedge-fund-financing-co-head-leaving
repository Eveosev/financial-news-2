Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Europe’s biggest
investment bank by revenue, said Jon Hitchon, co-head of a unit
providing financing services to hedge funds, is leaving the firm
after 15 years.  Renee Calabro , a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, said New
York-based Hitchon was departing. She declined to comment
further by telephone today.  Murray Roos, co-head of European equities, will succeed
Hitchon and work with Barry Bausano to jointly manage the
department, known as Markets Prime Finance, the Frankfurt-based
bank said earlier in a memo to staff.  The New York Post reported Hitchon’s departure earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
