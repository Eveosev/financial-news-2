The  difference  between Treasury
five-year and 10-year notes yields widened to the most in more
than two years as Federal Reserve Chairman-nominee  Janet Yellen 
told Congress she will promote the Fed’s unprecedented stimulus
program until economic growth is stronger.  Thirty-year bonds briefly pared gains after a $16 billion
sale of the debt drew lower-than-average demand. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid
with the amount offered, was 2.16, versus an average of 2.48 at
the past 10 auctions. Inflation control is important and the
central bank’s stimulus program “will not continue
indefinitely,” Yellen testified at her confirmation hearing to
lead the Fed.  “As dovish as Yellen is, she’s dovish for the front end of
the curve,” said  David Ader , U.S. government bond-strategy head
at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The 30-year
got themselves a little bit of a concession. The market is quite
range-bound right now.”  The current 30-year yield dropped three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.79 percent at 4:59 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.625 percent
bond due in August 2043 rose 18/32, or $5.63 per $1,000 face
amount, to 97 1/8. The yield fell as much as six basis points.  The 10-year yield dropped three basis points to 2.69
percent.  Bond Sale  The  yield curve  measuring the difference between Treasury
five-year and 10-year note yields in the U.S. reached 1.37
percentage points, the most since August 2011, on speculation
the Fed’s target interest rate may be lower for longer under a
Yellen-led Fed.  “Supporting the recovery today is the surest path to
returning to a more normal approach to  monetary policy ,”
Yellen, the Fed’s vice chairman,  said  in remarks to the Senate
Banking Committee.  Traders project an 87 percent chance the Fed will keep its
benchmark rate at current levels by December 2014, compared with
74 percent odds a month earlier, according to Fed funds futures
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Policy makers have pledged interest rates will stay at
almost zero while the outlook for inflation is no higher than
2.5 percent and unemployment remains above 6.5 percent. The
jobless rate was at 7.3 percent last month, the Labor Department
reported on Nov. 8.  Economic Targets  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose to $370.5 billion,
above the 2013 average of 314.87 billion. It fell to a 2013 low
of $147.8 billion on Aug. 9. The high was $662.3 billion on May
22.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
MOVE Index fell to 61.95, the lowest level since Oct. 31 and
below the 2013 average of 71.8.  Policy makers have pledged  interest rates  will stay at
almost zero while the outlook for inflation is no higher than
2.5 percent and unemployment remains above 6.5 percent. The
jobless rate was at 7.3 percent last month, the Labor Department
reported on Nov. 8.  “There’s an increased probability the unemployment rate
threshold could be lowered from 6.5 percent to 5.5 percent,”
said Donald Ellenberger, head of multi-sector strategies at
Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. “That would have significant
implications for the Treasury market.”  Fed Policy  The U.S. central bank currently buys $85 billion of
Treasuries and  mortgage-backed securities  each month to keep
downward pressure on borrowing costs. It purchased $3.171
billion today in notes maturing between November 2020 and August
2023. Officials will decide to pare their purchases to $70
billion a month at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the
median of 32 economist estimates in a Bloomberg News survey on
Nov. 8.  Fed Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser , an
opponent of Fed bond purchases, said the central bank should
focus on price stability as its primary objective, and not worry
as much about “fluctuations” in employment.  “It would be appropriate to redefine the Fed’s monetary
policy goals to focus solely, or at least primarily, on price
stability,” Plosser said today in prepared remarks for a speech
at the  Cato Institute  in  Washington . “I base this on two facts:
Monetary policy has very limited ability to influence real
variables, such as employment. And, in a regime with fiat
currency, only the central bank can ensure price stability.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank is
falling short on its dual mandate to ensure  price stability  and
full employment. “We’re missing on both of them,” Bernanke
said yesterday in Washington. “We need a stronger, more rapidly
moving economy.”  Economic Reading  Initial jobless claims  in the week ended Nov. 9 declined
2,000 to 339,000 from a revised 341,000 the week before that was
higher than initially reported, the Labor Department said today
in Washington. The median forecast of 51 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a drop to 330,000. Applications for five
states were estimated because of the Veterans Day holiday-shortened week, the Labor Department said.  The benchmark rate will end this year at 2.75 percent
before rising to 2.90 percent by March 31, according to a
Bloomberg survey of financial firms with the most recent
forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  At today’s auction, the 30-year bond drew a yield of 3.81
percent, compared with the 3.793 percent average forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers.
The yield at the last offering of long bonds, on Oct. 10, was
3.758 percent.  The auction is the final of three note and bond offerings
this week. The U.S. sold $30 billion of three-year debt on Nov.
12 at a yield of 0.644 percent and $24 billion of 10-year
securities yesterday at a yield of 2.75 percent.  The week’s sales will raise $6.5 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $63.5 billion,
according to the  U.S. Treasury .  To contact the reporter on this story:
