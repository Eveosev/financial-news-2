Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
increased 22 percent the past week, the most in more than four
years, according to a unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Onshore supplies including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen rose by 3.81 million barrels to
20.7 million in the week to yesterday,  International Enterprise 
Singapore said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the
biggest gain since August 2009. Supplies rebounded from the
lowest level in more than six months.  Stockpiles of  middle distillate  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene climbed by 1.32 million barrels, or 15
percent, to 9.85 million, according to the data. Supplies were
at a six-week high.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, reformate
and gasoline declined by 60,000 barrels, or 0.5 percent, to 11
million, the data show. Stockpiles dropped for the first time in
three weeks.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
