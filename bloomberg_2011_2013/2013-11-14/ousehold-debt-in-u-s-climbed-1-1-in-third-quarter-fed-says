U.S. household debt climbed 1.1
percent during the third quarter as borrowing for mortgages,
education, car purchases and on credit cards all increased,
according to a Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  survey.  Consumer indebtedness rose $127 billion to $11.28 trillion,
the biggest increase since the first quarter of 2008, according
to a quarterly report on household debt and credit released
today by the Fed district bank. Mortgage balances climbed $56
billion, student loans increased $33 billion, auto loans were up
$31 billion and credit-card debt rose by $4 billion.  “We observed an increase of household balances across
essentially all types of debt,” Donghoon Lee, senior research
economist at the New York Fed, said in a statement. “With non-housing debt consistently increasing and the factors pushing
down mortgage balances waning, it appears that households have
crossed a turning point in the deleveraging cycle.”  Americans have slashed their debt from a peak of $12.68
trillion in the third quarter of 2008, according to the New York
Fed.  Consumer sentiment in the U.S. fell in November to the
lowest level in almost two years as households reeled from last
month’s partial government shutdown. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment
index for this month dropped to 72, the weakest since December
2011, from 73.2 in October.  Delinquency rates continued to drop in the third quarter,
with 7.4 percent of outstanding debt in “some stage of
delinquency,” down from 7.6 percent in the second quarter, the
New York Fed said. There were about 355,000 new bankruptcies
during the period, about the same as in the comparable timeframe
in 2012.  The New York Fed said the report is based on data compiled
by the bank’s Consumer Credit Panel, a nationally representative
random sample from Equifax Inc. credit-report data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
