CVC Capital Partners Ltd., the
private-equity owner of Formula One motor racing, is preparing
to start a dedicated team targeting the health-care industry,
said three people with knowledge of the matter.  The leveraged-buyout firm has spent two months searching
for a global head of health-care to be based in  London , said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
private. The deal maker would probably join as a partner and
build up a team of about four, said two of the people.  The specialist group would be the firm’s latest after those
targeting financial institutions, technology companies and those
in central and eastern  Europe . The firm is investing a 10.5
billion-euro ($14 billion) pool it raised in July, the largest
private-equity fund raised by a European firm since the
financial crisis, according to Preqin Ltd., a London-based
research firm.  Health-care companies in CVC’s portfolio include China-based Asia Health Century International and Spanish private
hospital chain Idcsalud, according to its website.  Officials at London-based CVC declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
