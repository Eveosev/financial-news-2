The European Union will allow
exports of an additional 700,000 metric tons of sugar in the
2013-14 season that started last month, according to the
European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory arm.  The proposal, approved at the Sugar Management Committee
today, will enter into force in early December, the commission
said in an e-mailed statement. The new tranche of exports will
take shipments for the 2013-14 season up to 1.35 million tons,
within the maximum allowed by the World Trade Organization. The
EU issued export licenses for 650,000 tons on Oct. 10.  EU sugar production will fall to 16 million tons in 2013-14
from 17.22 million tons a year earlier, the commission estimated
in September. Quotas on the amount of sugar producers are
allowed to sell within the domestic market meant the bloc had to
take additional measures to boost local supplies by allowing
more domestic sales and boosting imports via tenders.  The commission also said it “intends to open further
market measures after the publication of the new regulation,”
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
