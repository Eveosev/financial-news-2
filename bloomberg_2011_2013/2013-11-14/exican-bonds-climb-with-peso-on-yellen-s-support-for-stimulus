Mexico’s benchmark bonds rallied,
pushing yields down the most in three weeks, as  Janet Yellen , 
the nominee for U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, said she’ll 
ensure monetary stimulus isn’t removed too soon.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 6.24 percent at 10:33 a.m. in Mexico
City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
increased 0.51 centavo to 129.96 centavos per peso. The peso
appreciated 0.1 percent to 13.0114 per dollar.  Bonds rose as Yellen said in testimony before a Senate
committee that she will sustain the central bank’s unprecedented
stimulus until she sees improvement in the economy. Mexico sends
about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S., and foreign
investors have poured into the Latin American nation’s bonds as
the Fed’s asset-buying program compressed Treasury yields.  Mexico ’s debt securities are benefiting from “an
environment of better risk appetite due to the expectations of a
possible delay in tapering,” Alejandro Padilla, a strategist at
Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB in Mexico City, wrote today in an
e-mailed research note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
