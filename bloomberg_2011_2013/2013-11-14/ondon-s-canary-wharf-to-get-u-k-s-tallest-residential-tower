A  London  developer plans to build
the U.K.’s tallest residential skyscraper on a site in the
city’s  Canary Wharf .  Ryan Corporation U.K. Ltd. bought the building site for 100
million pounds ($160 million), the closely held company said
today in an e-mailed statement. The 242-meter (794-foot) high
building would be the tallest in London’s second-largest
financial district and the apartments would have a total value
of more than 1 billion pounds when it opens in 2018.  Luxury homes in central London have been the best-performing part of the U.K. property market since at least 2009.
Prime residences in the U.K. capital have risen more than 60
percent from their low that year, according to broker Knight
Frank LLP.  “Londoners are used to office buildings going up and
coming down every 20 years or so,” Richard Berridge, chief
operating officer of Ryan Corporation, said in the statement.
“This doesn’t happen with residential towers” as they need to
be “more enduring,” he said.  Ryan has planning permission for a mixed-use development on
the site of about an acre, according to the statement. Ryan will
apply to the local government for permission to build the
residential tower, named Herstmere, at West India Dock Quay.  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) ’s tower at One St. George Wharf
is currently the U.K.’s tallest residential tower at 181 meters,
according to  Knight Frank . While apartments in London’s Shard
skyscraper are higher, the building consists mainly of offices,
a hotel and restaurants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
