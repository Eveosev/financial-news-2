Goldcorp Inc. (G)  and  Barrick Gold
Corp. (ABX) , the largest producers of the metal by market value, are
trying to sell their jointly owned Marigold mine in Nevada,
according to two people with knowledge of the sale process.  Bank of Montreal is running the sale, which is expected to
fetch at least $200 million, said the people, who asked not to
be named because the process hasn’t been made public. Goldcorp,
based in  Vancouver , owns 67 percent of Marigold and Toronto-based Barrick owns the rest.  Gold miners are seeking to cut costs and focus on their
most profitable operations after the metal slumped into a bear
market in April. Barrick, the world’s largest producer by sales,
sold three Australian mines this year and Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Sokalsky said Sept. 24 the company is in talks to
sell more assets.  Andy Lloyd, a Barrick spokesman, and Pav Jordan, a
spokesman for Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital Markets investment-banking unit, declined to comment on the sale. Goldcorp
spokeswoman Christine Marks also declined to comment.  Barrick  rose  0.4 percent to C$19.01 at 9:35 a.m. in
Toronto, while Goldcorp increased 0.1 percent to C$25.93.  Marigold is located about 40 miles (64 kilometers)
southeast of Winnemucca,  Nevada . It produced about 81,000 ounces
of gold in the first six months of this year, based on data
published on Barrick’s  website  and in Goldcorp filings.  Goldcorp  produced  a total of 2.4 million ounces in 2012
while Barrick  produced  7.42 million ounces.  To contact the reporters on this story:
