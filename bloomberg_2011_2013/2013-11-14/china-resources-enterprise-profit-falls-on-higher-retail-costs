China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291) , the
state-backed hypermarket operator and beermaker, said third-quarter profit fell 19 percent amid higher costs in its retail
operations and a year-earlier gain from asset sales.  Net income dropped to HK$920 million ($119 million) in the
three months ended September from HK$1.14 billion a year
earlier, the company said in a statement to  Hong Kong ’s stock
exchange today.  A campaign by authorities to stamp out gifting and
corruption among government officials hurt sales of pricey items
such as liquor and high-end cigarettes at the company earlier
this year. Higher labor and raw material costs also hit the
retail and beer businesses at government-backed  China Resources ,
which makes the country’s  best-selling Snow beer brand with
SABMiller Plc.  Tesco Plc (TSCO) , the largest U.K. retailer, is combining its 134
outlets and shopping-mall business in China with the almost
3,000 stores owned by the state-backed conglomerate in China and
Hong Kong. Tesco will pay HK$4.33 billion to gain 20 percent of
a venture with the Chinese company owning the rest, according to
their agreement announced this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
