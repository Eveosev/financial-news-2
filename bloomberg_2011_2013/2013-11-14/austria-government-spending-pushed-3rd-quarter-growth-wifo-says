Austria’s economy grew in the third
quarter after  government spending  and exports increased in the
nation of 8.5 million, the government-backed Wifo economic
research institute said.  Gross domestic product expanded 0.2 percent in the three
months through September, after revised data for the second
quarter showed unchanged GDP, the Vienna-based Wifo said today
in an e-mail. Government spending grew 0.4 percent in the period
while exports rose 0.2 percent.  Even as “foreign trade remains weak,” Wifo sees
“positive developments in the manufacturing and construction
sectors,” it said in the statement.  Austrians, who enjoy  Europe ’s lowest unemployment rate and
were named among the happiest people in the world by a United
Nations study, elected a new parliament in September. The
nation’s economy is driven by manufacturing exports, about a
third of which go to  Germany . Companies like high-quality
steelmaker Voestalpine AG and hydro-turbine maker Andritz AG are
global leaders in their industries, even if not household names.  To contact the reporter on this story:
