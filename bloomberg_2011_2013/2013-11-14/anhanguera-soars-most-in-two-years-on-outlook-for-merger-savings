Anhanguera Educacional SA,  Brazil ’s
second-largest education company, soared the most since 2011 as
its forecast for cost savings offset lower-than-forecast profit.  The shares jumped 9.6 percent to 15.12 reais at 3:09 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo , the biggest one-day advance since August 2011 on a
closing basis. Trading volume was 3.3 times the three-month
full-day average after Anhanguera said in a filing it expects
300 million reais ($129 million) in benefits over the next three
years from the merger with Kroton Educacional SA, which agreed
to buy its smaller rival for 5 billion reais in April.  Sixty percent of the synergies will come from cost cuts,
with the rest tied to higher revenue and more efficient
investment after the merger is complete, according to the
filing. Anhanguera  reported  adjusted net income of 4.28 million
reais in the three months ended in September, 93 percent below
the average of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The forecast benefits from the merger are “significantly
higher than the market was expecting,” Itau BBA analysts led by
Thiago Macruz wrote in a research note today. “This might
signal that both companies are confident in the merger’s
potential even with the potential hurdles from Anhanguera’s
operations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
