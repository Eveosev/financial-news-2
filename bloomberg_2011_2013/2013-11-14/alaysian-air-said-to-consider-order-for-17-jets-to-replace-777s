Malaysian Airline System Bhd. (MAS)  may
order at least 17 planes to replace its aging  Boeing Co. (BA) 
777-200s as the state-run carrier seeks fuel-efficient aircraft
to pare costs, a person familiar with the matter said.  Malaysian Air is considering both Boeing and Airbus SAS
jets for the order and will take a decision on the manufacturer
and type of planes in the first quarter of 2014, said the
person, who asked not to be identified as the information is
private. The carrier aims to add the new planes starting 2017,
the person said.  The company is upgrading its fleet after fuel costs and
competition from discount carriers including  Malaysia ’s AirAsia
Bhd. pushed it into two straight  annual losses . Budget operators
in  Southeast Asia  have ordered at least 1,000 new aircraft in
the past five years as economic expansion across the region
enables more people to start flying in countries such as the
Philippines and  Vietnam .  Malaysian Air Group Chief Executive Officer Ahmad Jauhari Yahya couldn’t be immediately reached for comment as he’s
traveling overseas. Najmuddin Abdullah, the airline’s head of
strategic communications, also didn’t respond to an e-mail and
telephone calls.  The carrier, based in Subang Jaya, Malaysia, will take
delivery of 24 new aircraft this year and another 25 over the
next two years, Ahmad Jauhari said in a June 11 interview in
Kuala Lumpur. The carrier ordered 15 Airbus and 35 Boeing planes
in 2011.  The airline is retiring 30 aircraft from its fleet this
year to cut costs. New planes typically consume less fuel than
older aircraft. With the retirement of old planes and new
aircraft coming, the average age of Malaysian Air’s fleet of 110
planes will be 5.4 years by end of this year, Ahmad Jauhari said
then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
