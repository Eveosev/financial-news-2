The Treasury’s $24 billion sale of
10-year notes attracted the  most demand  in five months from a
class of investors that includes foreign central banks as the
 Federal Reserve  assesses the future of its bond-buying program.  Indirect bidders purchased 47.7 percent of the notes at the
auction yesterday, the highest level since the June 12 offering
of the securities. The figure compares with an average of 38.7
percent for the past 10 sales. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of debt
offered, was 2.7, compared with 2.58 at the October sale.  “It’s an attractive level compared with other assets in
the world,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist in
New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 21 primary dealers
required to bid at U.S. debt auctions. “Treasury yields aren’t
going to go significantly higher from here.”  The  yield  on the current 10-year note dropped seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.7 percent at 5 p.m. in
 New York  yesterday, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
It climbed on Nov. 12 to 2.79 percent, the highest level since
Sept. 18. The price of the 2.5 percent note due in August 2023
rose 5/8, or $6.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 9/32.  The auction drew a yield of 2.75 percent, the second-highest level at a sale of the notes in more than two years. The
Treasury in September sold $21 billion of the securities at a
yield of 2.95 percent, the  highest  since June 2011. Yields have
increased on speculation the Fed may scale back its $85 billion
a month in bond purchases as soon as December.  Direct Bidders  “Great auction,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in
New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., a primary
dealer. “We’re two-thirds through the supply period, and I
don’t expect them to taper in December.”  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 18.6 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 20.9 percent
at the past 10 auctions.  Investors bid $2.88 for each dollar of the $1.839 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  Fed policy makers will pare the monthly pace of bond-buying
to $70 billion at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the
median of 32 economist estimates in a Bloomberg News survey Nov.
8. In an Oct. 17-18 survey of 40 economists, the median forecast
also called for a reduction to $70 billion in March.  Treasury Returns  Ten-year notes have lost 6.4 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 2.8 percent by the broader Treasuries market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The 10-year
securities returned 4.2 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall gained 2.2 percent.  The government will auction $16 billion in 30-year bonds
today after selling $30 billion of three-year debt on Nov. 12 at
a yield of 0.644 percent. The sales will raise $6.5 billion of
new cash, as maturing securities held by the public total $63.5
billion, according to the Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
