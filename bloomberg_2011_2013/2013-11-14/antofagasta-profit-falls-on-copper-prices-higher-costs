Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper company
controlled by Chileâ€™s billionaire Luksic family, said profit
declined 28 percent after metal prices dropped and costs rose.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization slid to $2.05 billion in the first nine months of
the year from $2.85 billion a year earlier, Antofagasta said
today in a statement. Sales fell 9.2 percent to $4.4 billion.  The company, which increased copper output in the period by
4.4 percent to 538,300 metric tons, has suffered a decline in
prices as slowing economic growth eroded demand for the metal
used in pipes and wires. A slump in by-product volumes also
pushed up total cash costs per pound.  Copper for three-month delivery averaged $7,413 a ton on
the London Metal Exchange in the nine months, 6.9 percent less
than a year earlier. Antofagasta sold the metal at $3.26 a
pound, compared with $3.74 a year earlier, it said today.  The company reported a 34 percent jump in net cash costs to
$1.33 a pound. Output of molybdenum, a by-product used to harden
steel, fell 30 percent to 6,700 tons, Antofagasta said.  The London-based company is seeking to increase copper
production to about 700,000 tons this year from 640,500 tons.  The net cash position was $1.64 billion at the end of
September, compared with $2.56 billion at the end of December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
