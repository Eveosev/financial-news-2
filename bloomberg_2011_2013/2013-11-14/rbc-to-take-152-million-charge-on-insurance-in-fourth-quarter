Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender by assets, will record a C$160 million ($152
million) charge in its insurance business on proposed changes to
the tax treatment of life policies.  The charge, which Royal Bank expects to be C$118 million
after tax, is a result of proposed legislation in  Canada  that
would affect the policyholders’ tax treatment of certain
individual life-insurance policies, the Toronto-based lender
said today in a statement. The government tabled the legislation
on Oct. 22, the bank said.  The charge, which is based on current estimates and is
subject to change, will be reflected in Royal Bank’s fourth-quarter results, which will be disclosed on Dec. 5, the lender
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
