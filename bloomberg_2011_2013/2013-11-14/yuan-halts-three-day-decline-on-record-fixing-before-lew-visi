China ’s  yuan  snapped a three-day
drop as the central bank boosted the daily fixing to a record
before U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew visits this week.  The People’s Bank of China raised the  reference rate  by
0.04 percent to 6.1315 per dollar, the strongest level since a
peg to the greenback was removed in 2005. The yuan is allowed to
diverge a maximum 1 percent from the fixing. China should speed
its move to a market-determined exchange rate and open up its
markets more, Lew, who arrives in China tonight, wrote in a Nov.
12 editorial in The Wall Street Journal Asia.  “Historically, we have observed the yuan fixing tends to
be stronger ahead of these political events,” said  Ju Wang , a
foreign-exchange strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  Hong Kong .  The yuan gained 0.01 percent to 6.0922 per dollar in
 Shanghai , China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices show. It
reached 6.0802 on Oct. 25, the strongest level since the
government unified the official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993, and has rallied 2.3 percent in 2013.  The spot traded at a 0.64 percent premium over the daily
fixing, the least since Oct. 16. China will make markets
“decisive” in allocating resources, according to a Nov. 12
communique from the third full meeting, or plenum, of the
Communist Party’s 18th  Central Committee  in Beijing, which
stopped short of unveiling detailed policy shifts.  The PBOC widened the yuan’s trading limit to 1 percent from
0.5 percent last year and authorities have pledged to pursue a
more flexible  exchange-rate  policy.  Offshore Market  “The policy is still committed to further foreign-exchange
liberalization and financial reforms,” said HSBC’s Wang.
“Narrowing the spread between the fixing and spot rates is
still a necessary preparation for the widening of the band. It’s
very hard for the PBOC to widen the band when the currency is on
the stronger side of the band.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.02 percent
to 6.1596 per dollar in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts are trading at a 1.1 percent  discount 
to the onshore spot rate.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.04 percent
to 6.0771 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, was
little changed at 1.64 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
