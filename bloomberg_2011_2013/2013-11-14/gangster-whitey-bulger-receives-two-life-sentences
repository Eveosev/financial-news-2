James “Whitey” Bulger, the former
fugitive who ran a criminal gang in South  Boston  from the 1970s
to the early 1990s, received two life sentences plus five years
after being convicted in a racketeering and murder conspiracy.  Bulger, 84, who didn’t testify during his 10-week trial in
Boston, wore a prison-issued orange jumpsuit and didn’t speak as
he was sentenced.  “The scope, the callousness, the depravity of your crimes
is almost unfathomable,” U.S. District Judge Denise Casper said
to Bulger before she sentenced him. “Your crimes in my
estimation are made all the more heinous because they were all
about money.”  Casper also ordered restitution of $19.5 million to victims
and their families.  Today’s sentencing may be the last public appearance for
Bulger, who was captured in 2011 in  Santa Monica , California,
after hiding from authorities for 16 years and sharing a space
on the FBI’s most-wanted list alongside  Osama bin Laden .  He declined one last chance to speak his mind yesterday
during a hearing before that is often used by defendants to seek
forgiveness from their victims. About 15 family members of
victims read statements yesterday.  On Aug. 12, jurors found Bulger guilty on 31 counts of
racketeering and involvement in 11 killings, though he was
cleared in the deaths of seven other people.  The case is U.S. v. Weeks, 99-cr-10371, U.S. District
Court, District of  Massachusetts  (Boston).  To contact the reporters on this story:
