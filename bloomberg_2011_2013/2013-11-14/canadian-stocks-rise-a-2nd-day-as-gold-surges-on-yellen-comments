Canadian  stocks  rose to a two-week
high, as precious metals producers rallied after U.S. labor data
and comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman nominee  Janet Yellen  signaled further stimulus.  B2Gold Corp. climbed 5.1 percent as the price of the metal
halted a five-day losing streak. Pan American Silver Corp.
jumped 7.8 percent as silver rallied.  CGI Group Inc. (GIB/A) , the
company that has come under scrutiny for its work on the
Obamacare health exchange, surged 4.3 percent after reporting
fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  climbed 60.72
points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,431.38 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
highest since Oct. 30. The benchmark Canadian equity gauge has
advanced 8 percent this year, the third-worst performance among
global developed markets, ahead of  Hong Kong  and  Singapore .  “It’s a green light, as that was the biggest fear, that
the Fed would take away the punch bowl,” said  Ian Nakamoto ,
director of research with MacDougall MacDougall & MacTier Inc.
in Toronto. The firm manages about C$4 billion ($3.8 billion).
“Definitely, the testimony is positive for the markets. She
does have to contend with some hawks, and we’ll see whether
she’s a compromiser, but right now it looks like no tapering
until March.”  The  U.S. economy  and the job market are performing “far
short of their potential” and a strong recovery will ultimately
enable the Fed to reduce its stimulus, Yellen said in testimony
at her nomination hearing today.  Investors have been watching for signals on whether the Fed
will taper its $85 billion a month in bond purchases. The
stimulus has fueled a rally in equities this year.  Gold Rally  Raw-materials stocks rallied 1 percent to pace gains in the
S&P/TSX, as eight of 10  industries  advanced. Trading volume was
11 percent higher than the 30-day average.  B2Gold gained 5.1 percent to C$2.46 and Agnico Eagle Mines
Ltd. increased 4.5 percent to C$30.74. Gold surged 1.4 percent
to settle at $1,286.30 an ounce in  New York , halting a five-day
slump that was its longest since August. The S&P/TSX Gold Index
climbed 2 percent as 22 of 24 members advanced.  Pan American Silver jumped 7.8 percent to C$11.59 and
Silvercorp Metals Inc. added 3.5 percent to C$2.99 as silver
futures for December delivery increased 1.4 percent.  Health Exchange  CGI Group climbed 4.3 percent to C$39.24, a record high
after rising for a ninth time in 10 sessions. The company’s
merger with Logica Plc and the resulting contracts have fueled
profit and sales. Its contract developing the U.S. federal
government’s health-insurance exchange is a small part of CGI’s
revenue.  Linamar Corp. (LNR)  soared 14 percent to a record C$40.72 for the
biggest gain in the S&P/TSX. The Guelph, Ontario-based auto
parts maker reported third-quarter adjusted  profit  of 80
Canadian cents a share, topping analysts’ projections for 66
cents.  Tourmaline Oil Corp. increased 5.4 percent to C$42.62 and
 Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  rose 2.6 percent to C$33.11 as
crude fluctuated after touching a five-month low in New York.
Encana Corp. climbed 2.3 percent to C$19.02 to snap a three-day
slide.  Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. slumped 7.8 percent to
C$4.27, for a sixth day of declines. The miner disclosed it was
unable to obtain  project financing  for its Oyu Tolgoi copper
project in Mongolia. Potential investors balked at uncertainty
over when the company will be able to resolve “issues” with
the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
