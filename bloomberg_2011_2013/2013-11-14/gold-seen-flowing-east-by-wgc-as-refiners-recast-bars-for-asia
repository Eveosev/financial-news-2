Gold demand in  China , India and the
Middle East surged in the 12 months to September while European
sales contracted, underscoring a shift in the global bullion
market from west to east, according to the World Gold Council.  China’s demand for jewelry, bars and coins rose 30 percent
to 996.3 metric tons, while usage in India gained 24 percent to
977.6 tons, WGC data showed. European demand fell 11 percent,
with drops in  France , Switzerland and the U.K. Asia and the
Middle East’s share of global sales grew to 68 percent in the 12
months from 65 percent, while Europe’s fell to 8.3 percent from
11 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold’s slump into a bear market in April boosted demand
across Asia and the Middle East, outweighing redemptions from
bullion-backed exchange-traded products, the London-based group
said in a quarterly report today. Bullion is heading for the
first annual loss since 2000 as the Federal Reserve weighs
tapering stimulus amid prospects for a U.S. recovery. Bullion is
flowing eastward, according to the producer-funded council.  “The vast bulk of the year-to-date growth in consumer
demand for gold came from eastern markets,” the council said.
“The recent dynamics of the gold market have worked to ensure
that lower prices boosted Asian demand to an extent sufficient
to absorb the gold flowing from western markets.”  Smaller Sizes  In Europe, gold is being refined from larger bars suitable
for local users into smaller sizes preferred in Asia, the
council said. Exports of bullion from the U.K. to Switzerland --
where refineries are sited -- rose more than 10-fold to 1,016.3
tons in the first eight months, it said, citing data from
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency.  Asian bullion demand will keep expanding as elevated
inflation spurs purchases, HSBC Holdings Plc economists
including Frederic Neumann wrote last month in a report that
said the region is “going for gold.” A vault that can hold
2,000 tons was opened in  Shanghai  by Malca-Amit Global Ltd. this
month to target increased demand for storage space.  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,281.70 an ounce at
3:28 p.m. in New York, 23 percent lower this year and 33 percent
below the all-time high reached in September 2011. Holdings in
 bullion-backed ETPs  stood at 1,873.3 tons yesterday, taking this
year’s decline to 29 percent after assets gained every year
since the first products were listed in 2003.  Import Curbs  In the first three quarters of 2013, demand in China was
797.8 tons, ahead of India’s 715.7 tons, according to Marcus Grubb, managing director of investment at the WGC. That puts the
second-largest economy on pace to overtake  India  as the biggest
user as the Indian government imposes import restrictions on
gold. Global consumer demand rose 605 tons to 2,896.5 tons in
the nine months, the council said, with Asia and the Middle East
accounting for 90 percent of the increase.  “Tactical investors in western markets exited their
positions as they began to speculate on the early tapering of
U.S. quantitative easing,” the council said. “Conversely, at
the consumer level, demand for gold jewelry, bars and coins for
the first nine months of the year was at a historical record.”  European demand for jewelry, bars and coins fell 11 percent
to 310 tons in the 12 months to September, according to council
data, as French consumption dropped 48 percent, Swiss use lost
22 percent and U.K. demand shrank 6 percent. In the Middle East,
usage expanded 25 percent to 225.8 tons over the 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
