Janet Yellen , the nominee to be
chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the central bank should
take care not to withdraw stimulus too early.  “It’s important not to remove support, especially when the
recovery is fragile and the tools available to monetary policy,
should the economy falter, are limited given that short-term
interest rates are at zero,” she said in testimony to the
Senate Banking Committee in Washington today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
