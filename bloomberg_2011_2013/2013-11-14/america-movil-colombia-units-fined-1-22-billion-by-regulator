America Movil  SAB’s units in
 Colombia  were fined the maximum amount under consumer-protection
rules for ignoring hundreds of customer complaints, the
country’s industry regulator said.  Telmex Colombia SA and Telmex Telecomunicaciones SA ESP
will be fined 1.18 billion pesos ($612,000) each for repeatedly
violating their own systems that receive and resolve customer
requests, the regulator said in a statement today.  America Movil, which has about  59 percent  of Colombia’s
mobile-phone lines through its Claro brand, said it would
“practice its legitimate right of defense” once it was
notified of the regulator’s resolution.  “Telmex is respectful of Colombian authorities, their laws
and the decisions they take based on these laws,” America Movil
said in a separate statement.  The  shares  rose 1.5 percent to 13.97 pesos at the close of
trading in Mexico City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
