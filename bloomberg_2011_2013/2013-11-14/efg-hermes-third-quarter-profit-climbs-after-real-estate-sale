EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, the biggest
publicly traded Arab investment bank, said third-quarter profit
rose 43 percent, boosted by the sale of its former headquarters.  Net income for the period through Sept. 30 rose to 63.8
million Egyptian Pounds ($9.3m) from 44.5 million pounds a year
earlier, the Cairo-based bank said today in a statement.
Investment bank revenue rose to 191 million pounds, boosted by a
one-time gain of 24 million pounds from the real estate sale.  The bank, whose merger with Qatar’s Qinvest LLC collapsed
earlier this year, is focusing on operations in Gulf Cooperation
Council countries after saying political turmoil in its home
market discouraged foreign investors.  EFG-Hermes said it has booked revenue from advising Dubai
Group LLC on the $164 million sale of Dubai First to  First Gulf
Bank (FGB)  in the third quarter, while fees from the listing of  BLME
Holdings PLC (BLME)  on  Nasdaq Dubai (DPW)  would be included in the fourth-quarter results.  The stock fell 1.4 percent to 8.02 pounds at 1:53 p.m. in
Cairo compared to the benchmark EGX 30 Index’s 0.3 percent
decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
