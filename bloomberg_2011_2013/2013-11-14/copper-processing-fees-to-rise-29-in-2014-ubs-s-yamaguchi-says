Copper treatment and refining
charges will probably climb 29 percent in 2014 as mine
production increases, a UBS AG analyst said.  Benchmark treatment costs will likely rise to about $90 a
metric ton, from $70 this year, as refining charges increase to
9 cents a pound from 7 cents, Atsushi Yamaguchi, who specializes
in  Japan ’s steel and non-ferrous industries, said in an
interview today. In mid-January, Asian smelters including Pan
Pacific Copper Co. and  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362)  set the 2013 fees with
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)   Mining companies including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Freeport
have been negotiating with smelters to set the charges for 2014.
The higher fees may boost revenue for smelters including Pan
Pacific, which forecast global supply will outstrip demand by
305,000 tons in 2014 and world mine output will increase 13
percent to 16.2 million tons.  World supply of mined copper will expand no less than 4
percent annually in the 2012-16 period, Standard Bank Plc said
in an October report, compared with less than 1 percent in four
of the six years before 2012. Mines from  Rio Tinto Group’s (RIO)  Oyu
Tolgoi in Mongolia to Vale SA’s Salobo in Brazil are adding
production.  Treatment fees are expressed in dollars per ton of
concentrate received and refining fees in cents per pound of
copper in the ore. The fees are deducted from the price paid by
smelters to mining companies for the raw material.  BHP owns Escondida in Chile, the world’s biggest copper
mine. Freeport operates the Grasberg mine, the world’s second
largest, in Indonesia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
