Outfielder Andrew McCutchen was
chosen the National League’s Most Valuable Player after leading
the Pittsburgh Pirates to their first playoff appearance in 21
years.  The other finalists in voting by the Baseball Writers’
Association of America were Arizona Diamondbacks first baseman
Paul Goldschmidt and St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina.  Detroit Tigers third baseman  Miguel Cabrera  earlier today
won his second straight American League Most Valuable
Player Award, again topping runner-up Mike Trout.  Cabrera became the first repeat winner of the AL award
since Frank Thomas of the  Chicago White Sox  in 1993 and 1994.
A Detroit player has been chosen MVP the last three seasons,
with pitcher Justin Verlander winning in 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
