Chase Colemanâ€™s Tiger Global
Management LLC bought a stake in Yahoo! Inc. and boosted its
holding in  Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , its largest U.S.-listed stock
position, as it stepped up its bets on e-commerce.  Tiger purchased 8 million shares in Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo valued at $265 million at the end of the third
quarter, according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  The hedge fund-firm, which is based in New York and
oversees $6.2 billion in assets, also acquired a stake in
 Liberty Ventures (LVNTA) , which owns interests in video and Internet
commerce businesses, valued at $61 million as of Sept. 30. It
added a position in  TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP)  worth $20 million.  Tiger bought 97,000 shares of Priceline, increasing its
stake to $577 million at the end of the quarter, according to
the filing.  Carolyn Sargent , a spokesman for Tiger with
