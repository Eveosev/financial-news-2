Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind-turbine
maker, raised its order-intake outlook on sales in Europe and
 South Africa . The shares climbed the most in six weeks.  Nordex sees order intake for the year of as much as 1.4
billion euros ($1.9 billion), from as much as 1.3 billion euros
earlier, it said today in a statement. Net income for the first
nine months climbed to 5.3 million euros as sales advanced 47
percent and cost-cutting measures took effect, the Hamburg-based
company said.  “We are very satisfied with our business performance in
2013,” Chief Executive Officer Juergen Zeschky said. The
company reaffirmed its full-year earnings guidance.  Nordex climbed as much as 8.6 percent in Frankfurt, to
12.65 euros a share, the steepest intraday gain since Oct. 1. It
was trading at 12.22 euros at 10:42 a.m. local time. The shares
fell the most in five years on Nov. 11 after  Chancellor Angela
Merkel ’s government coalition negotiators agreed to cut aid for
new onshore wind projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
