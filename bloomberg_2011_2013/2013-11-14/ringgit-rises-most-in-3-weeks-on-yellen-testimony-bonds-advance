Malaysia’s ringgit rose the most in
almost three weeks after  Janet Yellen , the nominee for Federal
Reserve chief, said the  U.S. economy  must improve before policy
makers can begin cutting stimulus.  Government bonds  gained.  The currency halted a three-day decline after Yellen, in
testimony prepared for her nomination hearing in the Senate
today, said the U.S. economy and labor market are performing
“far short of their potential.” Malaysia’s  economy  probably
expanded 4.7 percent in the third quarter, compared with 4.3
percent in the previous three months, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey before data due tomorrow.  “Yellen’s statement signals market risk-on position,”
said Wong Chee Seng, a currency strategist at Ambank Group in
Kuala Lumpur. “The improvement in  Malaysia ’s GDP will also help
support the ringgit.”  The currency strengthened 0.7 percent to 3.1898 per dollar
as of 9:35 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, the steepest increase since
Oct. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier
touched 3.1861, the highest level since Nov. 11.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, fell 56 basis
points, or 0.56 percentage point, to 8.82 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.26 percent bonds due March
2018 decreased two basis points to 3.53 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Malaysia will sell 2 billion ringgit ($627 million) of
securities maturing in June 2028 today, according to data
published on the central bank’s website. Bidding ends at 11:30
a.m. The yield on the 15-year sovereign debt was little changed
at 4.21 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
