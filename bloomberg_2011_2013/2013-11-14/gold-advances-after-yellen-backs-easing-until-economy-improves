Gold gained after Federal Reserve
Chairman nominee  Janet Yellen  signaled she will carry on with
U.S. monetary stimulus and more Americans than forecast filed
claims for jobless benefits.  Yellen said in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee
today that the central bank should take care not to withdraw
stimulus too early, “especially when the recovery is fragile.”
Jobless claims in the week ended Nov. 9 declined 2,000 to
339,000, the Labor Department said today. The median forecast of
51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 330,000.  “The initial claims are worse than expected, giving gold a
boost,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J.
O’Brien & Associates, said in a telephone interview from
 Chicago . “The dovish statements from Yellen are also very
supportive.”  Gold futures for delivery in December gained 1.4 percent to
settle at $1,286.30 an ounce at 1:47 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The metal snapped five straight sessions of losses, the
longest slump since August. Bullion for immediate delivery
climbed 0.2 percent to $1,284.55 an ounce in  London .  Prices have tumbled 23 percent in 2013 as signs of economic
recovery spurred speculation that the Fed will start to cut its
monthly bond buying, strengthening the dollar. Global bullion
demand fell 21 percent in the third quarter as investors
continued to dump holdings of the metal through exchange-traded
funds and central banks slowed purchases, the World Gold Council
said.  “The market is re-appraising its expectations for Fed
tapering given Yellen’s clearly dovish comments,” said Nic Brown, head of commodity research at Natixis SA in London.  Global Demand  In the third quarter, global bullion demand slipped to
868.5 metric tons, from 1,101.4 tons a year earlier, the London-based World Gold Council said today in a report. Investors
pulled 118.7 tons out of ETFs and similar products, while buying
from central banks fell 17 percent, the council said.  Assets in gold-backed ETFs shrank 29 percent in 2013 after
gaining every year since the first products were listed in 2003,
data tracked by Bloomberg show. Some investors have lost faith
in the metal as a store of value amid a rally in global equities
and low inflation.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery jumped 0.8 percent to $1,444.10 an ounce, and
palladium futures for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to
$739.80 an ounce.  The largest union at Anglo American Platinum Ltd.’s South
African mines got permission to strike after a mediator failed
to resolve a wage deadlock between the labor group and the
world’s biggest producer of the metal.  Silver futures for December delivery increased 1.4 percent
to $20.722 an ounce on the Comex, snapping five sessions of
losses.  To contact the reporters on this story:
