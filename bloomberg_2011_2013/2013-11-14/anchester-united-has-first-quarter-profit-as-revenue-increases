Manchester United, the defending
champion in English soccer’s Premier League, said it had a
first-quarter profit as broadcasting and commercial revenue
increased.  Adjusted profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 was 2.2
million pounds ($3.5 million) compared with a loss of 600,000
pounds in the year-earlier period. The profit figure was
adjusted for charges related to the club’s initial public
offering, the repurchase of senior secured notes and other
items, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  United won its 20th league title last season and coach  Alex
Ferguson  retired after 26 years in charge, being replaced by
fellow Scot  David Moyes . Revenue rose 29 percent to 98.5 million
pounds in the period, driven by increases of about 40 percent in
commercial and broadcasting revenue.  “Our unique approach to the commercial business will
continue to drive future growth,” Ed Woodward, executive vice
chairman, said in the statement.  Matchday revenue declined 1.5 percent because United’s Old
Trafford stadium hosted Olympic soccer matches in the year-earlier quarter.  The company had an unadjusted net loss of 293,000 pounds in
the quarter, compared with net income of 20.5 million pounds in
the 2012 period, which benefited from a tax credit of 26.5
million pounds.  Manchester United  Plc entered into a floating to fixed
interest rate swap on its $315.7 million secured  term loan  to
create a minimum and maximum interest rate of 2.8 percent to 4.1
percent for the life of the facility, it said. The team also
started hedging foreign exchange risk of some revenue in dollars
by using its borrowings in the currency as the hedging
instrument.  To contact the reporter on this story:
