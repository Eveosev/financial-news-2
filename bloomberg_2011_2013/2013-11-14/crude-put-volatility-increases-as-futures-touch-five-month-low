Crude put options volatility
increased as underlying futures closed little changed after
touching a five-month low earlier in the session.  Implied volatility for puts protecting against a 10 percent
drop in January futures rose to 23.96 percent at 4:35 p.m. on
the  New York  Mercantile Exchange from 23.68 yesterday. At-the-money January options were almost unchanged at 18.3 percent, up
from 18.28 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate for January delivery fell 8 cents
to $94.41 a barrel on the Nymex. WTI crude for December delivery
slipped 12 cents to settle at $93.76 a barrel.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 51
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most-active
options were December $93 puts, which dropped 10 cents to 21
cents a barrel with 4,564 lots trading as of 4:48 p.m. December
$95 calls fell 10 cents to 11 cents on volume of 4,223 lots.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 58 percent of
the 134,961 lots traded. December $92 puts declined 28 cents to
14 cents a barrel on 9,127 contracts. December $95 calls rose 4
cents to 21 cents on volume of 8,163 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for December $80 puts,
with 43,234 contracts. Next were December $85 puts with 36,672
lots and December $90 puts with 34,584.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
