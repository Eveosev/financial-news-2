MLP AG (MLP) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest
financial-services broker, said third-quarter  profit  fell 37
percent as sales of pension products declined.  Net income dropped to 5.3 million euros ($7.1 million) from
8.4 million euros in the year-earlier period, the Wiesloch,
Germany-based firm said in a  statement  today. Revenue declined 6
percent to 114.5 million euros in the quarter.  MLP, led by Chief Executive Officer Uwe Schroeder-Wildberg,
said earlier this month that it no longer expects to reach a
target for earnings before interest and tax of 65 million euros
to 78 million euros for 2013. Chief Financial Officer Reinhard Loose said in an interview in September that it has become
“more difficult” to reach the goal because customers are
reluctant to spend money on long-term savings products.  Low  interest rates  “as well as the negative headlines
concerning life insurance contracts have added to the already
hesitant stance of many clients,” Schroeder-Wildberg said in
the statement.  The broker reiterated its forecast for earnings before
interest and taxes of between 65 million euros and 78 million
euros for 2014 and 2015.  MLP  shares  have lost 9.7 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of about 487 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
