OAO Gazprom, the largest natural gas
producer, said second-quarter profit climbed 30 percent after
retroactive payments from the previous year werenâ€™t repeated.  Net income rose to 202 billion rubles ($6.2 billion) in the
quarter ended June 30 from a restated 156 billion rubles the
previous year, the Moscow-based company said on its  website .
That matched the 201 billion-ruble average  estimate  of 10
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  European demand strengthened in the first half, allowing
the Russian exporter to increase deliveries and easing pressure
to reduce prices present last year. In 2012, Gazprom, which
provides  Europe  with about a quarter of its gas, recognized
retroactive discounts to customers in the region.  Revenue rose 10 percent to 1.11 trillion rubles in the
second quarter from a year earlier, according to the statement.
Free  cash flow  in the period amounted to 142 billion rubles,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on first-half and
first-quarter numbers.  First-half exports to European and other countries outside
of the former  Soviet Union  rose to 85.5 billion cubic meters
from 77.9 billion cubic meters a year earlier, while the average
gross price rose to $385.10 per 1,000 cubic meters from $381.20,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
