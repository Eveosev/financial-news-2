General Motors Co. (GM)  Chief Executive
Officer Dan Akerson may step down from his post as soon as next
year, Reuters reported, citing unidentified sources.  GM’s board is not in a hurry for Akerson to leave and an
official search for his successor has not begun, Reuters said.
Ulrich Weber, a spokesman at the automaker’s Opel brand, said he
could not immediately comment when contacted by Bloomberg.  The U.S. automaker said in April that the compensation mix
for Akerson, 65, was changed in 2012 to accommodate the
possibility he may retire before his long-term restricted stock
vests in three years. At least four executives, including North
America President  Mark Reuss  and Mary Barra, head of global
product development, have been mentioned as CEO contenders.  The carmaker is “very comfortable” with its succession
planning, Selim Bingol, GM’s head of corporate communications,
said according to Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
