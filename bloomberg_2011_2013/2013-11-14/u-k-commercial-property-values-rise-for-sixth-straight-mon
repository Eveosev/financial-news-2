U.K. commercial real estate values
rose for the sixth straight month in October as the economic
recovery gained pace, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and industrial
properties climbed 0.6 percent from a month earlier, London-based IPD said in a statement today. Total return, which
combines changes in real estate values and rental income, was
1.1 percent.  The U.K.’s jobless rate declined to 7.6 percent in the
third quarter, the lowest since 2009. British  services growth 
rose at the fastest pace in 16 years in October and
manufacturing and construction also expanded last month,  Markit
Economics  said Nov. 5.  “Returns are continuing to rise around the U.K. as
economic growth flows out of  London ,” Phil Tily, an IPD
managing director, said in the statement. “Office returns in
the South East outpaced those of central London, while
industrial units around the country are seeing stable growth as
investor sentiment improves.”  Office buildings had a 0.9 percent gain in October and
warehouse values climbed 0.8 percent, according to IPD. The
average value of retail properties rose by 0.3 percent.  Income-producing commercial properties lost value for 17
straight months through March and were unchanged in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
