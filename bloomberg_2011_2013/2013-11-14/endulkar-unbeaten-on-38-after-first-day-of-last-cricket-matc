Sachin Tendulkar  is 38 not out at
the end of the first day of his final cricket Test as India
finished the opening day of its second Test 25 runs behind the
West Indies.  Tendulkar is playing his 200th and final match in the
longest form of the game. He faced 73 balls, and hit 6 fours
today in Mumbai.  The hosts won the toss and put the West Indies in to bat.
The visitors were all out for 182 runs in 55.2 overs, and India
ended its day on 157-2.  Nicknamed “Little Master” and “Master Blaster,” the 5-foot-5 Tendulkar is playing in his hometown. He holds almost all
of cricket’s major run-getting records, including the most runs
and centuries in elite Test and one-day matches. In 2011, he
helped  India  win its first Cricket World Cup title
since 1983.  Last year, when just one month shy of his 39th birthday, he
became the first player to score 100 international centuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
