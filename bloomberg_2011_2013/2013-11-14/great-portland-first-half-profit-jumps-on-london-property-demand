Great Portland Estates Plc (GPOR) , the real
estate developer focused on London’s West End, said first-half
earnings climbed 92 percent as a shortage of space in the
district led to higher office rents.  Pretax profit excluding changes in asset values rose to
146.9 million pounds ($236 million), from 76.7 million pounds a
year earlier, the London-based company said in a statement
today. Net rental income climbed to 34.9 million pounds from
26.5 million pounds.  “London’s businesses are, once more, investing for growth
and our limited available space to let is attracting significant
interest, enabling us to lease at” higher rates,  Chief
Executive Officer Toby Courtauld said in the statement.
“Central London’s appeal as an investment destination of choice
continues unabated.”  Great Portland and competitors  British Land Co. (BLND)  and  Land
Securities Plc (LAND)  are building large projects in London close to
transport links to satisfy growing demand as Britain’s economy
improves. U.K. commercial real estate values rose for a fifth
straight month in September, according to Investment Property
Databank Ltd. Britain’s economy will expand 1.4 percent this
year and 2.2 percent in 2014, outpacing Germany and  France , the
largest economies in the euro region, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The average rent in Great Portland’s offices was 41.80
pounds a square foot, compared with 38.10 pounds six months
earlier. Adjusted net asset value rose 9.2 percent from the end
of March to 487 pence a share, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
