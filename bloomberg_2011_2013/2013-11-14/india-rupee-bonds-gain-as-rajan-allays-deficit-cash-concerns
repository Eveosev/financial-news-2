India ’s bonds dropped after a report
showed inflation accelerated last month by more than economists
predicted. The rupee pared earlier gains.  Wholesale prices  rose 7 percent in October from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since February and more than the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a 6.95 percent
increase, official data showed today. September’s rate was
revised to 6.99 percent from 6.1 percent.  Reserve Bank  of India
Governor Raghuram Rajan said yesterday he’d look at data before
deciding whether to raise the benchmark repurchase rate for a
third consecutive meeting.  “The inflation data is quite a large negative,” said
Vikas Babu, a currency trader at  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai. “The
revision is what’s spooking the market.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 climbed 10
basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 9.02 percent in
Mumbai, prices from the central bank’s trading system show. The
rate had dropped to as low as 8.88 percent earlier. The rupee
rose 0.3 percent to 63.12 per dollar, after rising as much as
0.6 percent earlier, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The rupee rebounded yesterday from a two-month low and 10-year sovereign bond yields dropped from the highest level in 12
weeks after Rajan predicted the current-account deficit will
narrow from a record and said the monetary authority will supply
adequate cash to the financial system.  Current Account  The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade will fall to
around $56 billion in the year through March 2014 from $88
billion in the previous 12 months, Rajan said at the  unscheduled
press conference  yesterday. He also announced the purchase of 80
billion rupees ($1.3 billion) of bonds set for Nov. 18, after
the government auctioned 150 billion rupees of debt maturing in
2020, 2027, 2030 and 2041 today.  “Rajan seems to be uncomfortable with yields above 9
percent,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a trader at Development
Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. The debt-purchase announcement “was
a positive for the market,” he said.  The 10-year bond yield rose three basis points from Nov. 8
and reached 9.15 percent yesterday, the highest since Aug. 19.
The rupee fell 1 percent for the week. Indian financial markets
are shut tomorrow for a local holiday.  Consumer price-inflation  accelerated to 10.09 percent last
month from 9.84 percent and  industrial production  increased 2
percent in September, official reports showed Nov. 12. A
Bloomberg survey had predicted a 3.5 percent rise in factory
output.  Volatility, Forwards  “We believe the weak economy, increases in  food supply ,
and recent policy rate hikes will provide a disinflationary
impetus over time, and recent data do not dispel this view,”
Rajan said yesterday. “We will watch the incoming data
carefully, especially looking for the effects of the harvest on
food prices as well as the second-round effects of fuel-price
increases and  exchange-rate  depreciation, before we make further
decisions on  interest rates .”  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell
103 basis points to 12.62 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards rose 0.4 percent to
64.55 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts advanced 0.4 percent to 65.15. Forwards
