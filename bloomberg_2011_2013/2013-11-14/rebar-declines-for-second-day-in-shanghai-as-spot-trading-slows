Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell for the second day amid waning trading in the spot
market and as construction slowed because of winter weather in
northern  China .  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange, fell as much as 0.7 percent to 3,620
 yuan  ($594) a metric ton and traded at 3,628 yuan at 10:57 a.m.
local time.  The  spot price  of rebar was little changed at 3,552 yuan a
ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Volume shrank in recent days as the onset of
winter weather reduced demand, said Xia Caijun, an analyst at GF
Futures Co. in Guangzhou.  “Lack of immediate demand for spot rebar, and weakness in
other industrial metals such as copper, have all added downward
pressure on the futures,” Xia said. “The downside might be
limited by strength in production costs.”  Iron ore for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange,
which fell 0.3 percent to 940 yuan a ton today, has advanced 2
percent this month. The steel-making material for immediate
delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel Index gained 0.2
percent to $136.1 a dry ton yesterday and has climbed 3.2
percent in November.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
