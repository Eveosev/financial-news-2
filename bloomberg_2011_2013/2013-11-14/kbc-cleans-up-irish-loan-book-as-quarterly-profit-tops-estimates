KBC Groep NV (KBC) ,  Belgium ’s biggest bank
by market value, said it will set aside as much as 775 million
euros ($1.04 billion) to cover doubtful loans in Ireland pending
the European Central Bank’s review of bank-asset quality.  Loan-loss provisions in the fourth quarter will include an
additional 661 million euros for restructured mortgages and
corporate loans in Ireland following a reassessment of the local
loan book, Brussels-based KBC said today in a statement. Third-quarter profit excluding some items rose 23 percent to 457
million euros,  surpassing  the 368 million-euro average of nine
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  KBC starts provisioning for restructured home loans in
Ireland, which make up more than 16 percent of the 15.5 billion
euros of loans outstanding in the country, before an ECB-led
review of European banks’ asset quality next year might show a
loan-loss coverage shortfall. While the additional loan
impairment won’t leave KBC with a capital shortfall, it may
potentially delay an accelerated repayment of the remaining 2.33
billion euros of Flemish state aid.  “This seems in line with market expectations,” said
 Albert Ploegh , an analyst at ING Groep in Amsterdam who had
assumed a one-off charge of 500 million euros to 600 million
euros for Ireland. Risk-weighted assets came down 4 percent
during the quarter, “explaining in part the strong capital
generation.”  Irish Loans  KBC said its common equity ratio, assuming full application
of the Basel III capital rules, increased to 12.5 percent at the
end of September from a pro-forma figure of 11.8 percent in
June. With a self-imposed minimum ratio of 10 percent, KBC had
about 2.25 billion euros of  excess capital  before the additional
provisions in Ireland, which may also inflate risk-weighted
assets.  The bank’s shares rose as much as 3.5 percent on Euronext
Brussels and traded 1.36 euros higher at 40.69 euros by 10:24
a.m. local time, extending gains so far this year to 56 percent.
That’s the  sixth-best  performance among the 44 companies in the
Bloomberg Europe 500 Banks and Financial Services Index.  KBC also forecast Irish loan loss provisions will decline
to about 175 million euros, plus or minus 25 million euros, next
year before shrinking to less than 100 million euros in 2015 and
forecast its banking unit in the country will be profitable
again as of 2016.  The bank’s net interest margin, the difference between what
it pays for funds and what it charges for loans, widened to 1.77
percent, a 5 basis-point increase from the preceding quarter and
the highest margin in five quarters, led by lower funding costs
at group level.  Net income in the three months through September fell to
272 million euros from 531 million euros a year earlier as
 divestments , including the pending sale of Antwerp Diamond Bank
NV, and the transfer of some  KBC Ancora (KBCA)  CVA loans, curbed profit
by 231 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
