Australia ’s dollar reversed earlier
gains on speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut
interest rates even after a potential delay in the Federal
Reserve’s plan to slow asset purchases.  The Aussie rose from an eight-week low against the
greenback yesterday after Fed chairman nominee Janet Yellen said
the economy must improve before monetary stimulus can be
trimmed. The nation’s 10-year bond yields posted their steepest
drop in three weeks. The RBA lowered its benchmark interest rate
to a record 2.5 percent in August, from 4.75 percent in October
2011.  “There was a big knee-jerk reaction from Yellen’s comments
yesterday, there was a big move on the upside so there’s now a
big move on the downside,” Marc Chandler, chief currency
strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York, said
in a phone interview. “The RBA will still have to cut rate.”  Australia’s dollar fell 0.7 percent to 92.96 U.S. cents as
of 9:23 a.m. in New York from 93.60 yesterday, when it added 0.6
percent. Ten-year government bond  yields  declined seven basis
points to 4.2 percent, after touching 4.3 percent yesterday, the
most since March 2012.  The Australian dollar will finish the year at 93 U.S.
cents, while the New Zealand dollar will end at 82 U.S. cents,
according to median estimates of analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The Aussie has fallen 7 percent in the past six months, the
worst performance most among 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
