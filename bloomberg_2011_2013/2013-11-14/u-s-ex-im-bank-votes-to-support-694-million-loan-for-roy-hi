The board of the U.S. Export-Import
Bank, an independent federal lending agency, gave preliminary
approval for $694 million in financing for billionaire  Gina Rinehart ’s Roy Hill iron ore project in Australia.  The vote by the lender’s board today will support the
purchase of mining equipment from U.S. companies including
Caterpillar Inc. and  General Electric Co. (GE) , Daniel Reilly, a bank
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  Rinehart, Asia’s richest woman, is seeking A$7 billion
($6.5 billion) of debt from banks and export credit agencies to
help build the A$10 billion iron-ore mining venture in Western
Australia’s Pilbara region, comprising a mine, rail and port
operations. Roy Hill expects to conclude financing talks for the
debt package by the end of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
