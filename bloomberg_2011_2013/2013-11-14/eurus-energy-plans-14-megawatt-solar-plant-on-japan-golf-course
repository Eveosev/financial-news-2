Eurus Energy Holdings Corp., a
Japanese developer of clean-energy projects, will build a 14-megawatt solar-power plant in northern  Japan .  The facility, to be built on a former golf course
straddling the Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures, is expected to
start operations in March 2015, the Tokyo-based company said in
a statement today.  Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)  will supply panels and electricity
generated at the plant will be sold to  Tohoku Electric Power
Co. (9506) , according to the statement.  Eurus also plans a 33.5-megawatt solar-power plant in the
Hyogo prefecture in western Japan, the company said in a
statement last week. It will start running in July 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
