Palm oil  swung between gains and
losses on concern that prices near a 13-month high may curtail
consumer demand even as lower production trims stockpiles.  The contract for delivery in January rose and fell at least
0.5 percent before ending the morning session at 2,599 ringgit
($813) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives in  Kuala
Lumpur . Futures advanced to 2,628 ringgit on Nov. 1, the highest
close since September 2012 and 21 percent more than the 2,167
ringgit settlement on July 29, meeting the common definition of
a  bull market .  “The consumers want to digest these levels for a little
bit and wait to see where prices are heading,” Donny Khor,
deputy director of futures and commodities at RHB Investment
Bank Bhd., said by phone from Kuala Lumpur. “The stockpiles
have not accumulated as high as earlier estimated.”  Stockpiles rose 3.5 percent in October to 1.85 million tons
from a month earlier, below the 2.5 million tons a year earlier,
data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board showed this week.
Production gained 3.1 percent to 1.97 million tons, while
exports rose 3.3 percent to 1.66 million tons.  Palm will probably trade from 2,400 ringgit to 2,600
ringgit in coming months,  Dorab Mistry , director at Godrej
International Ltd., said at a conference in China today. Futures
may rise to 2,800 ringgit on good biodiesel demand in Indonesia
and poor output in January and February, he said. At 2,800
ringgit, demand would drop and prices would be set to decline in
the second half, he said.  Soybean oil  for December delivery was little changed at
41.24 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in January declined 0.6 percent to $13.0725 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for May delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
6,292 yuan ($1,033) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange and
soybean oil advanced 0.2 percent to 7,236  yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
