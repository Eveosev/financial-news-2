Residents of Cobb County,  Georgia ,
will fund $300 million, or 45 percent, of a new $672 million
stadium for  Major League Baseball ’s  Atlanta Braves , county
officials said.  The Cobb County Commission said today in a statement on its
website that financing won’t rely on increased property-tax
revenue.  The majority of the contribution will be covered by a
portion of a $368 million revenue-bond sale by the Cobb-Marietta
Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority, which will own the stadium.  The Braves will cover $92 million of the debt over the
length of a 30-year lease, the county said. The remainder will
be covered through existing property tax revenue; taxes and fees
on hotels and businesses; and a rental-car levy that has yet to
be approved.  “By taking on more than 90 percent of the upfront costs of
the stadium, we are minimizing the amount that has to be bonded
by Cobb County,” Mike Plant, the team’s vice president of
business operations, said in a statement.  The Braves, who announced on Nov. 11 plans to leave
downtown Atlanta’s Turner Field after the 2016 season, will
contribute $372 million to the project, Cobb County said in a
release on its  website  today.  The Braves will pay $280 million by opening day of the 2017
season. Braves President John Schuerholz said the team also
plans to sell corporate naming rights to the stadium to offset
financing costs.  Cozier Confines  The Braves decided to build a stadium 13 miles (21
kilometers) northwest of downtown Atlanta with their lease at
17-year-old Turner Field expiring in 2016. The new venue will
have a capacity of about 42,000 people, compared with 50,000 at
Turner Field, according to the team.  Turner Field, which was built for the 1996 Olympics and
became the Braves’ home the following year, has cost the team
about $125 million in improvements, and it needs about $150
million more, as well as an additional 5,000 parking spots, the
team said this week.  The stadium would open the same year as a $1 billion
facility for the  National Football League ’s Atlanta Falcons is
scheduled to open downtown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
