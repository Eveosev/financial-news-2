The European Central Bank said
professional forecasters cut their estimates for inflation in
the euro area, reinforcing concerns over the risk of
disinflation in the single currency bloc.  Forecasters estimate  euro-area inflation  will average 1.4
percent this year and 1.6 percent in 2015, down from 1.5 and 1.8
percent three months ago, the Frankfurt-based ECB said today in
its monthly bulletin, citing its quarterly survey. The 2014
estimate was left unchanged at 1.5 percent.  The ECB Governing Council, which will publish its own new
projections in December, cut its  benchmark interest rate  to a
record low of 0.25 percent on Nov. 7, citing concerns over the
slowdown of price growth in the euro zone. Inflation was at 0.7
percent in October, well below the ECB’s target of close to 2
percent.  The downward revision in the survey is mainly due to the
“modest economic recovery” and “ample excess capacity” in
the currency bloc, as well as “low wage increases owing to high
unemployment levels,” the ECB said. Echoing ECB President Mario Draghi’s policy statement at the Nov. 7 meeting, the central
bank said in the bulletin that it expects inflation rates to
remain “at present or lower levels” because of the “overall
subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term.”  Forecasters polled by the ECB also improved their estimate
for euro-area growth, saying gross domestic product would
contract 0.4 percent in 2013 and increase 1 percent next year.
That compares to previous forecasts of a 0.6 percent contraction
and a 0.9 percent increase and brings projections in line with
those of the ECB’s September outlook. For 2015, the forecasters
see GDP growing 1.5 percent, according to the poll.  Unemployment in the euro-area will remain at 12.1 percent
this year and in 2014, the survey showed, before falling to 11.6
percent in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
