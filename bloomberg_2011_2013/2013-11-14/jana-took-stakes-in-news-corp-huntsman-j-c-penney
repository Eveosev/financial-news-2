Jana Partners LLC, the $7 billion
hedge-fund firm run by  Barry Rosenstein , took stakes in Rupert
Murdochâ€™s News Corp., chemical maker  Huntsman Corp. (HUN) , and
struggling retailer  J.C. Penney (JCP)  Co. last quarter.  The fund acquired 8.55 million class A shares of News Corp,
the New York-based newspaper publisher, valued at $137.3 million
as of Sept. 30, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission today. Jana also bought 6.4 million
shares in Huntsman, valued at $132.4 million, and 500,000 shares
in J.C. Penney with a market value of $4.4 million.  New York-based Jana is an event-driven fund. It generally
invests in companies undergoing shifts such as mergers, spinoffs
and bankruptcies, and is known for pushing management to make
changes.  Charles Penner, a partner at Jana, declined to comment on
the new stakes.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in U.S.
equities must file a  Form 13F  within 45 days of the end of each
quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on U.S.
exchanges, as well as options and convertible debt. Hedge funds
are lightly regulated pools of capital whose managers can invest
in any asset and share in annual profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
