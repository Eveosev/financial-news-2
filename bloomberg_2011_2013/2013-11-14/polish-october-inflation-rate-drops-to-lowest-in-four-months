Polish inflation slowed to a four-month low in October, threatening the central bank’s pledge to
keep  interest rates  unchanged until at least mid-2014.  Consumer prices  rose 0.8 percent from a year earlier, less
than last month’s 1 percent advance, the Warsaw-based statistics
office said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
37 economists was for a 1 percent increase. Prices rose 0.2
percent from September.  Polish policy makers left rates at a record low last week,
saying inflation will continue to undershoot their 2.5 percent
target through 2015. Amid heightened concern about the
possibility of deflation, the European Central Bank cut its
benchmark to 0.25 percent Nov. 7 as Czech policy makers began
the first koruna sales in 11 years to stoke price growth.  Slower inflation “may intensify expectations that the
monetary-policy council could follow the ECB and consider
further policy easing,” Piotr Bujak, chief economist for  Poland 
at Nordea Bank AB, said by phone before the data were released.
Even so, this “possible impact has already been offset by
stronger-than-expected Polish economic figures.”  Gross domestic product rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier
in the third quarter, beating the median estimate of 36
economists for a 1.6 percent expansion, the Warsaw-based Central
Statistics Office said today.  The zloty gained 0.2 percent to 4.1883 per euro at 2:04
p.m. in Warsaw, weakened from 4.1866 before the data was
released. The yield on two-year notes fell four basis points
after the price data were published to 2.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
