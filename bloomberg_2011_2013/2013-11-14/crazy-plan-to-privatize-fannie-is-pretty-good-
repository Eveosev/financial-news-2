The weird thing about  this new Fairholme Capital Management proposal  to privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is that it's pretty good! (The Wall Street Journal has the proposal slides  here  and the accompanying letter to Ed DeMarco, the Frannies' regulator,  here .) My natural inclination is to look for tricks in things like this, and there  is  a pretty big trick here and we should talk about it, but if you were just an honest disinterested person trying to figure out the right next steps for the U.S. mortgage market, you'd probably want to do at least some of what Fairholme suggests.  Their proposal is to split Fannie and Freddie into two chunks. One chunk is just the legacy business -- every mortgage guarantee Frannie wrote, every bond they bought, etc. etc., from the dawn of time until some cut-off date, say June 30, 2014. That would be managed in runoff, with the government getting 80 percent of the value realized in runoff and the common shareholders -- who exist, and are aggrieved -- getting the other 20 percent. 1  The other chunk is like the computers and people and procedures used in writing mortgage guarantees, which the government would sell to two new, state-chartered, not-named-Fannie-or-Freddie insurance companies owned by Fairholme and its fellow holders of Fannie and Freddie preferred stock. After the cut-off date, these newcos would write mortgage guarantees similar to what Fannie and Freddie do now -- i.e. on mostly prime, conforming, etc. mortgages -- but without an implicit government guarantee. The proposal, at least, involves them being capitalized to a AAA sort of level 2  with private money, and underwriting based on rational private-sector business judgment rather than whatever conflicting goals (affordable housing, government budget requirements, mindless bureaucracy) the public sector might use to underwrite risk and charge premiums. Anyone else would be free to compete with them in this business, which Fairholme et al. think will be profitable. 3  And the newcos would adapt to any level of government subsidy that Congress ultimately wants: They'll be the first-loss guarantee if the government wants to reinsure mortgages, or they'll take 100 percent of the risk if the government wants to get out entirely. I don't know, it is not an awful idea in the abstract. You can worry a lot about the details, and because this is the mortgage market the details matter a whole ton. How much will the newcos charge for their guarantees, and how much more yield will investors demand for newco-guaranteed instead of Frannie-guaranteed mortgages? (Presumably newco's guarantees will be worth less than the government's, but will they also be more expensive? Maybe  not that much !) What will this do to mortgage liquidity and the  to-be-announced market ? Will the newcos in fact be adequately capitalized, and will their state regulators be any good at finding out? 4  So a lot to think about, but you've got to think about the same things in any scenario where private capital takes over the credit risk in the U.S. mortgage market. Now of course, you might think about those things and say ehh, never mind, let's just leave that credit risk with the government, but Fairholme very cleverly begins its presentation with two pages of quotes from various luminaries, starting with Barack Obama and ending with Ed DeMarco, all saying "we need private capital in the mortgage market." I suppose the theory is that DeMarco might forget that he said, that but the presentation will remind him. But of course there is a trick. The big trick is that the plan calls for the new companies to be capitalized with $52 billion consisting of "$17.3 billion in new cash raised in a rights offering" from Fairholme & friends plus, what is this, "$34.6 billion of restricted capital from conversion of existing preferred stock." That existing preferred stock is the stock that Fairholme & friends currently own, and it trades at, I don't know, not that much, call it 30 to 40 cents on the dollar. 5  That means that Fairholme & friends will stump up $17.3 billion in cash and $10 or $12 or $14 billion worth of preferred stock, and will be handed in exchange a brand new, pristine, no-debt company with $52 billion in assets, 6  for an immediate first-day gain of $20 billion or so. Which is pretty good!  Actually, this understates the issue a bit; that preferred stock might be trading for 30 to 40 cents on the dollar, but if you ask a lot of people  they'll tell you  it's  worth  zero cents on the dollar, and some of them are in the sorts of positions in the U.S. government that can make that a reality. If you believe that, then this plan is more like a $34.6 billion one-day windfall to those preferred holders. That windfall -- look, I mean, you can think your thoughts about it. There seem to be only two schools of thought. One is, "who are these dirtbags, Fannie and Freddie exist -- and are currently making a profit -- only because of their essentially explicit government guarantee, so of course all the profits should go to the government."  The other is , "these poor shareholders, the government stole their shares and never compensated them, the least it can do is give them credit for their pref at 100 cents on the dollar in this convoluted scheme." I mean either of those is probably a defensible view; obviously, Fairholme takes the latter view, and almost as obviously the government takes the former. I have my own view but why would you care about it, honestly? I was just going to say, that windfall affects this proposal in weird ways. In particular the proposal is not, on its face, "give us the franchise to run mortgage insurance in America." It's "open mortgage insurance up to fair competition, and sell us some assets to start competing." But if you capitalize New Fannie and New Freddie with a combined $52 billion, they'll be pretty pretty big -- probably bigger than all their plausible competitors combined. 7   And that capital will be pretty cheap, in that every dollar that investors put in will get them as much as three dollars in newco capital, depending how you count.  The newcos' competitors will not have those advantages. (Nor will they, I guess, have the Frannies' buildings and people and regulatory relationships, which should probably count for something.) Every dollar they want to put up to start a new insurance business will cost them a dollar. 8  That's not necessarily a recipe for healthy competition. And the opposite of healthy competition is something like "duopoly of too-big-to-fail mortgage guarantors with implicit government backing, whose profits go to private investors but whose losses are socialized ad hoc in a crisis." 9  Which sounds a little too familiar.
