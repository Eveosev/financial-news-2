Andy Warhol ’s auction record soared
as the Pop Art icon’s silk-screen painting “Silver Car Crash
(Double Disaster)” sold for $105.4 million at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in  New
York  tonight.  The work was won by a phone client of Charles Moffett, vice
chairman of Sotheby’s Americas, who vied with at least two other
highly determined telephone bidders.  The 1963 canvas was estimated at more than $60 million. It
came up early during the auction of contemporary art.  More than 8 feet tall and 13 feet wide, the work consists
of two canvases. One features five rows of three images
repeating a mangled car; the second is a blank silvery surface.  Warhol’s previous auction record was set in 2007 at
Christie’s when a single-panel car-crash painting, “Green Car
Crash (Green Burning Car I)” sold for $71.7 million.  Another highlight of the auction is a group of seven
paintings from the collection of hedge-fund billionaire  Steven A. Cohen , whose SAC Capital Advisors LP pleaded guilty to
 securities fraud  and agreed to pay $1.8 billion to settle
insider-trading charges.  The first work of the Cohen trove, an abstract painting by
Brice Marden, fetched $10.9 million, setting a record for the
American artist.  The group could tally as much as $85 million. Cohen has
been guaranteed an undisclosed minimum price on six works,
regardless of the outcome.  The 61-lot sale continues.  To contact the reporters on this story:
