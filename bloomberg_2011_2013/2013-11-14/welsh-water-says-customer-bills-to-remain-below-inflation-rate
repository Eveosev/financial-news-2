Welsh Water Utilities Finance Plc,
the largest water supplier in  Wales , said its average household
price rise for 2014-2015 will remain below the annual inflation
rate for a fifth year.  Dwr Cymru Welsh Water confirmed the bill without providing
an exact figure after publishing results today that showed the
company invested 178 million pounds ($285 million) in projects
and infrastructure in the six months to September. The average
water and sewage household bill will rise 3.5 percent or about
13 pounds this year, according to the U.K. regulator Ofwat.  Welsh Water, like the second-largest publicly traded U.K.
water utility  Severn Trent Plc (SVT) , has said its price rise from
April will be less than the retail  price index  for inflation. A
public debate on water bills in the U.K. has arisen after four
of the biggest six energy suppliers raised gas and power prices
last month at three to four times the inflation rate.  “Many of our customers are finding it tough to make ends
meet and we are committed to keeping our own costs as low as
possible and to help even more of our most disadvantaged
customers through our range of social tariffs,”  Chris Jones ,
chief executive officer of Welsh Water, said in a statement.  The sixth-largest water and sewerage company in  England  and
Wales provides water and sewer services to more than 3 million
customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
