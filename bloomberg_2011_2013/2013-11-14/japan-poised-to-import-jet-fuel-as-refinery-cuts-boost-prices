Japan ’s two biggest airlines are
poised to import jet fuel for the first time in at least six
years as the country’s shrinking refining capacity pushes up
domestic prices.  Japan Airlines Co. (9201)  and  ANA Holdings Inc. (9202)  may begin buying
the aviation fuel from abroad starting in April for overseas
flights from Tokyo’s  Narita airport , according to officials at
the carriers. For the first time in a decade, the companies are
paying domestic refiners a premium to regional benchmark prices
in long-term supply contracts.  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. and Idemitsu Kosan Co. will
shut refineries next year amid closures that have reduced
Japan’s processing capacity by 27 percent in the past thirty
years. That’s driving up the cost of domestic jet fuel and
prompting airlines to look further afield for supplies.  “We are likely to begin full-scale jet imports in fiscal
2014 or after,” Kazunori Kidosaki, a Tokyo-based spokesman at
Japan Airlines, said by e-mail. “We are concerned about rising
prices of  jet fuel  from Japanese refiners because they are
expected to continue cutting refining capacity.”  Narita International Airport Corp., the state-run operator
of the airport known as NAA, forecasts fueling volumes to grow
2.6 percent to 4.79 million kiloliters in fiscal 2013 amid
increasing traffic, according to a statement posted on its
website. Volumes rose 9.8 percent in the previous fiscal year.  Japan Airlines, the country’s second-largest carrier,
stopped buying fuel from overseas in 2007 after prices from
local oil refiners fell below those of imports, according to
Kidosaki. Japan Airlines shipped in about 600,000 kiloliters a
year at that time through Narita Airport Storage Plant
Association, an alliance formed by JAL, ANA,  Air Canada (AC/A) ,  Delta
Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , he said.  Fuel Sales  Japan’s bonded jet fuel sales totaled 7.4 million
kiloliters in fiscal 2012, up 3.4 percent from a year earlier,
according to data compiled by the Petroleum Association of
Japan. That’s about 127,000 barrels a day.  Airlines agreed last year to pay as much as a few cents a
gallon above benchmark prices in Singapore for annual supplies
of bonded jet fuel, or tax-exempted aviation petroleum sold only
for overseas flights. That was the first time in at least a
decade that airlines paid a premium, up from a discount of 6
cents to 9 cents.  Jet fuel  swaps  in  Singapore  have averaged $122.23 in 2013
compared with $126.59 last year. They were at $120.83 a barrel
yesterday, down 3.6 percent this year.  Jet Costs  “ANA is considering to start jet fuel imports because of
recent steady prices”, Ryosei Nomura, a Tokyo-based spokesman
said by e-mail. “We have never imported fuel in the past.”  ANA, Japan’s largest carrier, raised its  forecast  for jet-fuel expenses for fiscal 2013 to 363 billion yen ($3.7 billion)
on Oct. 30, up 21 percent from a year earlier and 4.6 percent
higher than its projection in July. Japan Airlines expects fuel
costs for fiscal 2013 to rise 14 percent from last year to 281
billion yen, the  company  said Oct. 31.  Fuel is supplied to the airport by pipeline from Chiba Port
 Aviation Fuel  Terminal on the coast of Tokyo Bay, owned by NAA.
The terminal has 13 tanks with a total storage capacity of
95,000 kiloliters. Four berths can handle tankers loading a
maximum of 8,000 metric tons, according to Osamu Nakamura, a
Narita-based spokesman at NAA. Oil product tankers are typically
50,000 tons.  Marubeni Storage  The five-company association known as NASPA leases storage
tanks at an adjacent terminal owned by Marubeni Ennex Corp.,
Kidosaki from Japan Airlines said. Berths at the terminal are
big enough to receive 50,000-ton tankers, according to data
posted on Marubeni Ennex’s  website . Marubeni’s terminal is
connected to the Chiba facility by pipeline.  JX will stop refining operations at its 180,000 barrel-a-day Muroran refinery in northern Japan in March 2014 while
Idemitsu will close its 120,000 barrel-a-day Tokuyama plant the
same month.  Japan’s trade ministry predicts the country’s jet fuel
demand will increase 3.5 percent in fiscal 2013, according to
forecasts released in June, the highest growth among oil
products.  To contact the reporters on this story:
