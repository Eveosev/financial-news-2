Banks in  Australia , New Zealand,
 South Korea  and Vietnam are among the “most exposed” in the
Asia-Pacific region to a sudden worsening of  Europe ’s sovereign
debt crisis, Moody’s Investors Service said.  The Australian, New Zealand and Korean banking systems’
dependence on foreign funding puts them at risk of increased
costs in the event of wholesale market stress, Stephen Long, a
managing director at Moody’s financial institutions group, said
in a statement. Vietnam’s weak financial system and dependence
on cheap dollar loans subjects its banks to tightening foreign-
currency liquidity.  These banking systems are “more vulnerable to the first-
round impact of a further worsening of the euro area crisis than
other systems in Asia Pacific,” Long wrote after Moody’s
released a report the topic. “Our base case is that the
resilience of banks in Asia Pacific will generally persist.
However, the risks to that scenario have increased, warranting a
closer examination of how banks could be affected under more
adverse scenarios.”  Australian and  New Zealand  lenders’ proportion of total
external funding stands at 19 percent and 16 percent
respectively, New York-based Moody’s said. Korea’s banking
system has a foreign currency-to-deposit ratio of 328 percent
and relies on external markets for 9 percent of its funding, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
