Japanese  stocks  rose, with the Nikkei
225 Stock Average closing at its highest level in three months,
after U.S. joblessness fell and companies from  Nikon Corp. (7731)  to
 Oki Electric  Industry Co. raised profit forecasts.  Sony Corp.  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  advanced on optimism
rising employment in the U.S. will boost exports. Nikon surged
11 percent after raising its full-year outlook on sales of
digital cameras. Oki Electric jumped 14 percent.  “In the second half of last year, talk was all about
whether the U.S. will go back into a recession,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment strategist for the Asia-
Pacific region at Russell Investment Group, which manages about
$150 billion. “Now I think talk will be about what will be the
strength of the recovery in the U.S. That’s an important shift
in the balance of risk.”  The  Nikkei 225  gained 1.1 percent to 8,929.20, its highest
close since Oct. 31. Almost three shares rose for each that fell
in the benchmark gauge, which in January posted its biggest
monthly advance since October, amid signs  Europe  is containing
the debt crisis and the  U.S. economy  is improving. The broader
Topix Index climbed 1.2 percent to 769.85 today.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3
percent today. The gauge advanced 1.5 percent in  New York  on Feb.
3, capping a five-week rally, after Labor Department data showed
payrolls increased by 243,000 in January, the most since April.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for
a rise of 140,000.  Sony, Toyota  Exporters rallied as the unemployment rate in the world’s
biggest economy dropped to 8.3 percent, the lowest since
February 2009.  Sony,  Japan ’s biggest consumer-electronics exporter,
climbed 4 percent to 1,492 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s top
camera maker, gained 1.6 percent to 3,400 yen. Toyota, which
gets about 28 percent of sales from  North America , rose 3
percent to 2,986 yen.  Shares of Toyota and other Japanese carmakers also rallied
after the maker of Prius forecast sales will climb 21 percent
this year as production recovers following disruptions caused by
natural disasters in Japan and Thailand last year.  Nikon surged 11 percent to 2,064 after the world’s second-
largest maker of professional-grade cameras raised its operating
profit estimate by 7.5 percent to 72 billion yen ($939 million)
for the year ending March 31.  Missed Estimates  Oki Electric surged 14 percent to 80 yen, the biggest
advance on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , after the electronics maker raised
its operating profit forecast for the year ended March 31 by 13
percent to 17 billion yen.  Of the 901 companies on the Topix that have reported
 earnings  since Jan. 9, 90 have exceeded analysts’ estimates
while 187 have fallen short, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the world’s largest maker of plasma
televisions, jumped 6.3 percent to 637 yen, after saying profit
in the year beginning April 1 may recover after a record loss.
President Fumio Ohtsubo reiterated a pledge to restructure by
cutting jobs and shifting output overseas while becoming a
leader in solar panels and rechargeable batteries.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index  rose 3.1 percent to 20.95,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Tokyo Electron Ltd. , a manufacturer of chipmaking gear, had
the biggest decline on the Nikkei 225. It slumped 8.2 percent to
4,040 yen after reporting profit declined 47 percent from a year
earlier in the nine months ended Dec. 31 due to a slowdown in
the global economy and floods in  Thailand .  “Earnings have been bad, but that’s expected,” said
Yutaka Yoshii, a strategist at Mito Securities Co. in  Tokyo .
“Overseas markets have been solid so that’s helped restore
confidence.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
