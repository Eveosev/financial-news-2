Bill Gross ’s Pimco Total Return Fund,
the world’s biggest mutual fund, attracted $231 million in
investor deposits in January as performance rebounded.  The new money ended three straight months of redemptions
from Pimco Total Return, according to data compiled by Chicago-
based  Morningstar Inc . Investors pulled about $3 billion from
the fund in the three months ended Dec. 31, bringing withdrawals
last year to $5 billion, the research firm said.  The $250.5 billion Pimco Total Return has advanced 2.4
percent this year, beating 99 percent of similarly managed
funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund last
year rose 4.2 percent, lagging behind 69 percent of its peers,
after Gross missed a rally in U.S. Treasuries and put money into
riskier assets.  Gross, who eliminated Treasuries from the fund a year ago,
reversed his position and boosted the proportion of  U.S.
government debt  to 30 percent as of the end of December,
according to data on Pimco’s website. Investor deposits into the
fund were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
