Most senior German executives, 92
percent, say they expect  Europe ’s debt crisis to be resolved,
according to a Handelblatt newspaper survey published today.  Eighty-eight percent of the 619 respondents said they had
“concern” over the potential impact of the crisis on their
business, the survey conducted between Jan. 17 and Feb. 2 by
polling company Forsa GmbH showed.  Yet more than half of the executives -- 53 percent -- said
they expect to boost their companies’ sales this year compared
with 2011 and 43 percent see higher profits. Some 41 percent
said they expect to increase payrolls this year and 38 percent
plan to keep investment levels constant compared with 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
