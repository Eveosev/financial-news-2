Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) ,
 India ’s largest mortgage lender, plans to raise as much as 60
billion rupees ($1.2 billion) in bonds, loans and deposits by
March 31, to meet an increase in demand for new homes.  “A significant part of the borrowings may be raised by way
of bonds and loans,” V. Srinivasa Rangan, the  executive
director  at the company said in an interview in Mumbai today.
“Our balance sheet is typically growing by 20 percent per
annum, which will need to be funded.”  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in December that gross
domestic product will increase 7.5 percent in the fiscal year
that ends March 31, and will expand at 9 percent in the long
term. Home sales rose in the fourth quarter last year in
Bangalore, Chennai and the National Capital Region, which
includes  New Delhi  and its surrounding areas.  HDFC, as the company is known, raised 206.9 billion rupees
in bonds last year to finance demand for new homes, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mortgages at the company may increase between 15 percent
and 20 percent, Rangan said. Property prices in India will
probably drop about 5 percent to 10 percent, making homes more
affordable, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
