AS Baltika (BLT1T)  fell the most in almost
seven months after the Baltic region’s third-largest clothing
retailer said it had a “significant” loss last quarter.  The stock fell as much as 24.8 percent, trading 18.2
percent lower at 31 euro cents at 11:02 a.m. in Tallinn. Baltika
has lost 75 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 29
percent decline for its eastern European peer group, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Baltika, which has reported losses since the fourth quarter
of 2008, said after the close of trade on Feb. 3 the loss for
the fourth quarter was due to one-time write-offs and
provisions. The Tallinn-based company’s net assets were below
half its share capital as of Dec. 31, the company said.  The Nasdaq OMX Tallinn stock exchange in November added a
watch notation to Baltika shares because the company’s net
assets of less than half of share capital don’t meet
requirements set by Estonia’s commercial code.  To contact the reporter on this story:
