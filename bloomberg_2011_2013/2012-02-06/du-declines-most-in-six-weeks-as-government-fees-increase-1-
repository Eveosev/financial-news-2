Emirates Integrated Telecommunications 
Co . dropped the most in six weeks after the company also known 
as Du said fees payable to the government last year will be 
higher than that in 2010.  The shares retreated 2.3 percent, the most since Dec. 21,
to 3 dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. They rose earlier as
much as 3.6 percent.  The royalty to the federal government will include 5
percent of  revenue  in addition to 15 percent of profit before
any distribution, the company said in a statement to the Dubai
bourse. Du paid 15 percent of its profit in royalties in 2010
compared with 50 percent in the previous year.  “Du announced royalty fees that are effectively equivalent
to 40 percent of net income before royalty,” said Samer Darwiche, a Dubai-based analyst at Gulfmena Investments. “Some
investors were betting that it would only be 15 percent.”  The company had a  2010 profit  of 1.31 billion dirhams ($357
million) compared with 264 million dirhams a year earlier after
royalty reductions. Du  may report  full-year earnings on March 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
