OPEC agrees that crude prices should
remain at current levels, and its members have “never”
discussed pumping more oil to offset a possible drop in Iranian
exports,  Algeria ’s energy minister said, according to  El Khabar.   Algeria generated $71.5 billion in revenue from oil exports
last year, up 27 percent from 2010, the newspaper reported
today, citing Youcef Yousfi. The increase was due to higher
crude prices, which Yousfi expects to remain stable at about
$100 a barrel in 2012, according to the report.  Algeria and  Iran  are members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story: Salah Slimani at
