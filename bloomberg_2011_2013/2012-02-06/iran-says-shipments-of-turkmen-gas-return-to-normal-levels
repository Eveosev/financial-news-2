Shipments of natural gas to  Iran  from
 Turkmenistan  have returned to normal levels, the state-run  Fars 
news agency reported, citing Iranian ambassador to Ashgabat,
Mohammad-Mousa Hashemi.  Daily imports from Turkmenistan dropped to as little as 6
million cubic meters since Feb. 1, less than the contracted
volume, the agency reported yesterday. Iran imports as much as
30 million cubic meters of gas a day from its neighbor,
according to todayâ€™s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
