Russiaâ€™s inflation decelerated in
January to the slowest annual rate since the  Soviet Union 
collapsed two decades ago as food costs declined and the
government delayed increases in utility tariffs.  Inflation was 4.2 percent from a year earlier, down from
6.1 percent in December, the Federal Statistics Service in
Moscow said in an e-mailed statement today. Prices rose 0.5
percent from a month earlier. Economists forecast rises of 4.3
percent and 0.6 percent, two surveys showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
