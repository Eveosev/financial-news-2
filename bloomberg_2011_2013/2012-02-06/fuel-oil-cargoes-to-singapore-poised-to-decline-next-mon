Fuel-oil cargoes to  Singapore  from
outside  Asia  may fall to 2.165 million metric tons next month,
or 14.5 million barrels, according to vessel-charter data
compiled by Bloomberg.  At least eight Very Large Crude Carriers, booked to collect
the fuel from ports in  Europe , the Caribbean and the U.S., may
arrive in Singapore in March, according to Poten & Partners
Inc., a broker in  New York . That compares with 3.555 million
tons set to arrive this month and 3.265 million tons in January.  Two VLCCs have so far been booked to carry 545,000 tons of
the shipping and power-station fuel to Singapore in April,
according to the data. Singapore is Asia’s oil hub and the
region’s largest port for  fuel-oil  cargoes.  The following is a summary of all VLCCs reported as booked
to carry fuel oil to Singapore. Cargo sizes are in thousands of
tons. Arrival time is calculated based on information on the e-
ships.net website and assuming a total of four days for loading
and unloading at ports.  A VLCC can carry about 2 million barrels of oil. Charters
can be canceled and traders can also hire smaller vessels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
