The cost of protecting Japanese
corporate bonds from default dropped to its lowest in five
months, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index declined four basis points to
151 as of 8:59 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
index is headed for its lowest close since Sept. 8, according to
data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was unchanged at 164 as of 8:10 a.m. in
 Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was unchanged at 144
basis points as of 11:00 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The measure has declined for five days, according
to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
