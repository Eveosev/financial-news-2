General Electric Co.’s  financial
services unit was sued by units of  AerCap Holdings NV (AER)  for
allegedly failing to tell the aircraft-leasing company about a
lawsuit in  Brazil .  According to a complaint filed Feb. 3 in New York State
Supreme Court in  Manhattan , a lawyer for General Electric
Capital Corp. told  AerCap  in February 2010 that the company was
liable for “millions of dollars” in a court case involving
Transbrasil SA, the bankrupt Brazilian airline.  The airline had sued GE and AerCap in February 2001 to void
promissory notes issued in 1999 in connection with the leases of
two engines and an aircraft, according to the complaint. GE lost
an appeal of a 2007 judgment entered against AerCap and other
defendants, and Transbrasil is asking Brazilian courts to
enforce the judgment, according to the complaint.  “GE had concealed from AerCap that it was named as a
defendant in the lawsuit and had directed the defense of the
lawsuit -- with catastrophic results -- without AerCap’s
knowledge or consent since 2001,” AerCap said in the complaint.  Transbrasil has said the appeals court decision entitles it
to about $223 million, including interest, from AerCap and other
defendants, according to the complaint.  General Electric hasn’t been served with the lawsuit and
doesn’t comment on pending litigation, Daniel Whitney, a
spokesman for  GE Capital  Aviation Services, said in an e-mail.  The case is AerCap Ireland Ltd. v. General Electric Capital
Corp., 650341/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
