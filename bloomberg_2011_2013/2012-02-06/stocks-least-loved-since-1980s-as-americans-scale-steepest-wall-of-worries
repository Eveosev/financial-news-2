The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index’s
best start in 25 years is doing little to restore Americans’
confidence in the stock market.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. shares has  climbed  6.9 percent
in 2012, the most since it rose 14 percent to begin 1987, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. It traded at an average of 14.1
times earnings since the start of 2011, the lowest annual
valuation since 1989. More than $469 billion has been pulled
from U.S. equity mutual funds over five years and New York Stock
Exchange volume slipped to the lowest since 1999.  Pessimism is taking a toll on the securities industry,
where more than 200,000 jobs were lost last year, even as U.S.
unemployment declines as the economy accelerates. Sentiment is
the worst since the early 1980s, when 17 years of equity market
stagnation gave way to the biggest rally in history.  “Investors are scared to death,”  Philip Orlando , the New
York-based chief equity strategist at Federated Investors Inc.,
which oversees about $370 billion, said in a telephone interview
on Feb. 3. “The fears are justified, but from a valuation
standpoint the market has overshot, as it typically does. We’ve
been pounding the table to put money into equities.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 2.2 percent last week
to 1,344.90 after U.S. unemployment fell to the lowest level
since February 2009 and manufacturing grew at the fastest rate
in seven months. The  S&P 500  retreated 0.2 percent to 1,342.13
at 11:46 a.m. in New York today.  Companies whose shares dropped at least 20 percent last
year helped lead the gain, with  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR)  climbing 26
percent,  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  rallying 17 percent and Cummins
Inc. increasing 13 percent.  Three-Year Rally  Sentiment has deteriorated even as the S&P 500  rose  99
percent since March 9, 2009. The 106 percent expansion in U.S.
earnings during the last nine quarters, the most since 1987,
helped fuel the rally. For the period ended Dec. 31, 67 percent
of companies in the S&P 500 beat analyst profit estimates as
earnings advanced 3.3 percent.  Investors pulled money from mutual funds that buy U.S.
stocks for a fifth year in 2011, the longest streak in data
going back to 1984, according to the  Investment Company
Institute  in  Washington . Withdrawals were $135 billion last
year, the second-highest total after 2008, the ICI said.  Concern European leaders will fail to keep  Greece  from
defaulting, the May 2010 flash crash in which $862 billion was
erased from equities in less than 20 minutes and some of the
most volatile markets on record last year helped spur the
withdrawals. Of the more than $11.1 trillion that was  wiped off 
U.S. shares between 2007 and 2009, $8.1 trillion has been
restored.  ‘Never Happened’  “The stock market has effectively doubled since the March
’09 low, and we’re still in redemption territory for equity
funds,” Liz Ann Sonders, the New York-based chief investment
strategist at Charles Schwab Corp., said in a Feb. 2 phone
interview. Her firm has $1.7 trillion in client assets. “That’s
never happened.”  Money managers haven’t kept up with the S&P 500’s advance.
 Hedge funds  declined 5 percent in 2011, the third year of losses
since 1990, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc.
A total of 21 percent of 525 global fund categories tracked by
Morningstar Inc. topped their benchmark indexes last year, the
fewest since at least 1999.  ‘Fear and Anxiety’  Valuations have fallen even as the S&P 500 rallied 21
percent since the end of 2009 because profits increased five
times as fast. The price-earnings ratio for the benchmark gauge
of American equities has fallen to 14 times reported income,
down from 24 at the end of 2009. The ratio slipped as low as
10.2 at the end of the 17-month  bear market  in 2009, when the
S&P 500 declined 57 percent.  “It was the severity and the quickness of the fall and how
long it’s taking to come out of the trough that’s been adding
fear and anxiety,” Warren Koontz, head of U.S. large-cap value
stocks at Loomis Sayles & Co. in  Boston , which manages about
$160 billion, said in a telephone interview on Feb. 3. “Over
time, if things continue to progress on a step-by-step basis,
people will come back to stocks.”  Trading at the  New York  Stock Exchange declined to the
lowest level since 1999 last month, with the average volume over
the 50 days ending Jan. 25 slowing to 838.4 million shares,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The value of stock
changing hands dropped to $24.9 billion, a 50-day average not
seen since at least 2005.  That’s contributing to a  contraction  on Wall Street. The
number of securities professionals registered with the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority fell to 629,518 last year, the
lowest end-of-year level since at least 2002.  Kaufman, WJB  At least three New York securities firms folded this year.
Kaufman Bros. LP, with a staff of about 40, WJB Capital Group
Inc., which had more than 100 employees, and Ticonderoga
Securities LLC, with about 75, closed as trading slowed and
funding evaporated.  “Institutional traders are more cautious, and the long-
only investors like mutual funds, which are typically a source
of demand, that money’s been coming out for the past four
years,” Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion
of assets at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham,  Alabama , said
in a Feb. 2 phone interview.  While  Wall Street  retreats, U.S. employers added 243,000
non-farm jobs in January, the most in nine months. Confidence
among U.S. homebuilders rose in January to the highest level
since 2007, according to an index released Jan. 18 by the
National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo & Co.  Whirlpool Rally  Among the 20 stocks in the S&P 500 with the  largest gains 
this year, seven were among the 20  worst  in 2011. Genworth, the
mortgage guarantor and life insurer, has rallied 40 percent
after losing 50 percent in 2011 even as earnings increased 65
percent. Analysts project the Richmond, Virginia-based company
will almost triple profit in 2012.  Whirlpool in  Benton Harbor ,  Michigan , posted the second-
best gain in the S&P 500 this year as its income for the final
three months of 2011 beat analyst estimates by 26 percent --
better than 92 percent of the 264 companies in the index that
have  reported  since Jan. 9. The world’s largest maker of
household appliances slid 47 percent in 2011, plummeting after
July on increased concerns about the economy stalling.  A 36 percent rally in  Cummins (CMI)  shares this year comes after
the Columbus, Indiana-based maker of  diesel engines  lost 20
percent in 2011. While earnings beat estimates in all but the
third quarter last year and  no analyst  recommends selling the
stock, investors pushed its valuation to 9.9 times reported
earnings. The price-earnings ratio surged 36 percent in 2012.  Lost Decade  Rallies have faded since 2000, when the dot-com bubble
drove the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  to a record high. The
gauge peaked at 11,722.98 that year, and has risen above and
then fallen below that level seven times since. It ended at
12,862.23 on Feb. 3, up 5.3 percent so far this year.  The past decade parallels the span between Dec. 31, 1964,
and the end of 1981, when the Dow added less than 1 point after
surging interest rates diminished the appeal of equities. While
the 115-year-old stock gauge ended the period at 875, it ranged
between 577.60 and 1,051.70.  After stalling for 17 years, the U.S. stock market staged
the biggest  bull market  in history through early 2000, driving
the Dow up 15-fold from its low point in 1982. The surge
coincided with a decrease in the yield on 10-year Treasuries to
6.68 percent from 13.55 percent. The rate was 4.21 percent at
the end of 1964, and it peaked at 15.84 percent in 1981. On Feb.
3, the figure was 1.92 percent.  Lower Rates  Falling interest rates failed to lift stocks in the last
decade as the S&P 500 slumped 12 percent from its high in March
2000. Equities slipped as the global economy experienced two
financial crises, including the worst recession since the 1930s.
Growth in U.S. gross domestic product  averaged  2 percent a year
between 1999 and 2011, compared with 3.6 percent between 1964
and 1981, and 3.3 percent from 1981 and 1999, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The retreat leaves stocks in position to rally because so
many bearish investors can be lured back to equities and the
market is cheap, according to Scott Minerd, the chief investment
officer of  Santa Monica , California-based Guggenheim Partners
LLC, which oversees more than $125 billion.  “Stocks are poised for a generational bull market, whether
it starts this year, or next year, or in five years, is
anybody’s call,” he said. “Even if we had a 50 percent
increase in multiples, stocks would still be cheap.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
