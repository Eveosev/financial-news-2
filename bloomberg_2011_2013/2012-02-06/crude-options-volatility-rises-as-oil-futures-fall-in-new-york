Crude oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures fell for the sixth time in seven sessions.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.9 as of 3 p.m. in  New York , up from
from 26.6 on Feb. 3.  “There was very light volume today,” said Michael
Truscelli, a broker at Paramount Options Inc. in New York.
“We’re still stuck in a short trading range.”  Crude for March delivery fell 93 cents, or 1 percent, to
settle at $96.91 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The 30-day range for the contract is $95.44 to $103.74.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $90 puts, with 1,725 lots changing hands at 3:06 p.m. They
fell 4 cents to 17 cents a barrel. March $97 puts, the second-
most active options, rose 20 cents to $1.68 with 674 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Bearish options accounted for 50.2 percent of the 127,893
