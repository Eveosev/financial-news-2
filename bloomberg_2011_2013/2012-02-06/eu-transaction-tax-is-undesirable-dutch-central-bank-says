The Dutch central bank said it
opposes the introduction of a European financial transaction tax
that it estimated would cost the nation’s lenders, pension funds
and insurers about 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion) and hurt
economic growth.  The Netherlands would be relatively hard hit by the levy
because of the size of its financial industry, the Dutch central
bank said in a statement today. The tax would lead to annual
costs of 2 billion euros for banks, 1.7 billion euros for
pension funds and 0.3 billion euros for insurers, it said.  It’s “doubtful” whether the tax proposed by the European
Union will limit risks, the bank said in a statement. “The
negative impact on the economy is a certainty.”  The European Commission in September suggested a tax of 0.1
percent on equity and bond transactions and 0.01 percent on
derivatives to raise 55 billion euros a year. EU finance
ministers are scheduled to discuss the levy in March. The Dutch
central bank joins the U.K. in opposing the measures.  The Dutch government has said it won’t block the
introduction of a European financial-transaction tax, while
“acknowledging” a worldwide introduction would be more
effective, Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said in November.  Balance sheets of Dutch banks, including  ING Groep NV (INGA) ,
 Rabobank Groep (RABO)  and ABN Amro Group NV, total almost five times
the size of the nation’s economy. In addition, the country’s
pension funds have about 835 billion euros in assets. The Dutch
central bank’s estimates don’t include investment firms, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
