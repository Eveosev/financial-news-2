Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  kept output
shut at six Australian offshore oil fields because of Cyclone
Iggy.  The Vincent and Enfield fields off North West Cape and
Cossack, Wanaea, Lambert and Hermes on the North West Shelf
remain closed, Laura Lunt, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-
mailed statement today. Woodside, based in Perth, began shutting
production on Jan. 25.  Output from  Apache Corp. (APA) ’s Van Gogh field resumed Feb. 5,
and the Stag field is “progressively recommencing,” Matthew
Coomber, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. Van Gogh
production was suspended on Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
