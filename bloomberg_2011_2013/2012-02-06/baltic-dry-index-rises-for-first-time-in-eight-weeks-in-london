The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of
commodity shipping costs, advanced from a 25-year low and rose
for the first time since Dec. 12 after falling rates boosted the
number of dry-bulk owners dropping anchor and refusing hire.  The index that tracks freight rates across four vessel
sizes gained one point to 648, ending a 33-day decline as
average hire costs for Panamax bulkers, the largest that can
transit the Panama Canal, gained for a second consecutive
session.  Earnings are reaching a bottom and pushing up rents as more
ships withdraw services,  Natasha Boyden , an analyst at New York
investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald LP, said in an e-mailed report
today.  “With rates near or below cash break-even for every vessel
class we’re starting to see more ships anchoring and refusing to
trade,” Boydon wrote. “We wouldn’t be surprised to see
earnings find some sort of bottom at these levels, which of
course doesn’t necessarily imply things will rebound any time
soon.”  The index declined as much as 63 percent this year and 66
percent since Dec. 12 amid a downturn in demand for the fleet of
more than 8,900 dry bulk vessels, which has expanded by a record
for two consecutive years. Its close of 647 points on Feb. 3 was
the lowest since August 1986, exchange data show. The index
peaked at 11,793 on May 20, 2008.  The number of vessels hired in January and December
declined to 749, 18 percent lower than the corresponding period
12 months earlier, according to Boyden, citing figures from
Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest shipbroker.  Capesize Vessels  Average rates for Capesize vessels, that haul ore and coal
and comprise about 40 percent of the dry bulk fleet capacity,
declined 0.7 percent to $5,214 a day, the lowest in 11 months.
Rents across five of the nine routes assessed by the gauge were
higher.  Panamax rents rose 4.9 percent, the most since May, to
$5,778 a day. Hire costs are still 56 percent lower this year.
Supramax vessels that haul minerals and grains slid 1.2 percent
to $6,277, a three-year low. Handysize ships, the smallest
tracked by the gauge, were $5,590, a fall of 1.6 percent,
exchange data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
