The  New York Giants  scored a
touchdown to lead the  New England Patriots  21-17 with 57 seconds
to play in the fourth quarter of the  Super Bowl .  The Giants went ahead in the first quarter when Patriots
quarterback Tom Brady was called for intentional grounding while
in his own end zone, resulting in a safety. Victor Cruz then
collected a 2-yard scoring pass from Giants quarterback Eli
Manning to make it 9-0 at the end of the opening quarter.  Stephen Gostkowski kicked a 29-yard field goal for the
Patriots at the start of the second quarter. Brady then capped a
96-yard scoring drive, tied for the longest in Super Bowl
history, with a 4-yard pass to Danny Woodhead eight seconds
before halftime to make it 10-9 to  New England  at Lucas Oil
Stadium in Indianapolis.  The Patriots extended their lead to 17-9 after the opening
possession of the third quarter when Brady found Aaron Hernandez
with a 12-yard pass to end an eight play, 79-yard drive.  Lawrence Tynes of the Giants then kicked field goals of 38
and 33 yards to make it 17-15 to the Patriots with one quarter
to play.  Each team is seeking a fourth win in the National Football
League championship game. The Giants last claimed the title by
beating the Patriots after the 2007 season, while New England
hasnâ€™t won since beating the  Philadelphia Eagles  following the
2004 campaign.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
