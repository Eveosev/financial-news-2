National Aluminium Co. (NACL) ,  India â€™s
biggest state-owned producer, posted a more-than-expected 80
percent decline in third-quarter profit as prices of the metal
fell and energy costs surged.  Net income  fell to 512.2 million rupees ($10.4 million), or
0.2 rupee a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 from 2.56
billion rupees, or 0.99 rupee, a year earlier, the company said
today in an exchange filing. The median profit estimate of 16
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 1.51 billion rupees. Sales
were almost unchanged at 14.3 billion rupees.  The company said in September it would increase imports of
coal, used to produce electricity, after a local shortage of the
fuel. Prices of aluminum, which is used to make products ranging
from beverage cans to aircraft, averaged 11 percent lower in the
quarter on the London Metal Exchange.  Expenses rose 30 percent to 15.1 billion rupees, including
a 75 percent increase in raw material costs to 3.65 billion
rupees, according to the filing.  National Aluminium shares fell 3 percent to 61.85 rupees at
the close of trade in Mumbai. The stock has declined 41 percent
in the past year.  Coal prices rose 8 percent to an average $114.5 a metric
ton in the quarter from a year earlier, according to researcher
