Frankfurt’s main suburban rail line
is facing “severe” delays and cancellations after a train
broke down at the Taunusanlage station in the heart of the
city’s financial district, the regional RMV public transport
operator said on its  website .  More than six firefighting vehicles came to the station,
located in front of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s headquarters, because of
smoke from a brake fault on the affected train, according to
police officers and firefighters on the scene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
