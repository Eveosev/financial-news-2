South Korean bonds fell the most in
two weeks as a U.S. government report showed employment topped
forecasts, supporting demand for riskier investments.  Nonfarm payrolls in the world’s largest economy rose by
243,000 last month, beating all estimates in a Bloomberg News
Survey, while the  unemployment rate  fell to a three-year low of
8.3 percent. The won declined for the first time in three days
as  Greece  continued talks with creditors to avoid a default.
Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  secured an outline
agreement during the weekend on additional budget cuts and is
working out how to meet conditions for international aid today.  “Yields are rising as U.S. economic data and stock gains
supported risk sentiment,” said Yum Sang Hoon, a Seoul-based
fixed-income analyst at SK Securities Co. “We saw overseas
investors selling bond futures this morning, and this is
prompting Korean investors to follow suit.”  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due
September 2016 climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 3.52 percent in  Seoul , Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. That was the biggest increase since Jan. 20. The one-year
interest rate swap was unchanged at 3.47 percent.  The won weakened 0.2 percent to 1,120.78 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,112.45
earlier, the strongest level since Nov. 9.  The Kospi  Index of
shares advanced 0.79 point to 1,973.13 after overseas investors
bought $1.2 billion more local shares than they sold last week,
exchange data show. The euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.3061.  “Overseas investors demanded lots of dollar today
following euro declines on Greek concerns,” fueling the won’s
decline, said Ryoo Hyun Jung, chief currency dealer at Citibank
Inc. in Seoul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
