HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA , a
Brazilian oil and natural-gas exploration company, rose to the
highest in more than a month after  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  found
oil near its Amazon exploration areas.  HRT, based in Rio de Janeiro, gained 2 percent to 472.01
reais in  Sao Paulo  after earlier reaching 493.99 reais, the
highest price since Jan. 3.  Petrobras has the potential to produce 1,400 barrels a day
of “good quality” oil at the SOL-T-171 block in the Solimoes
Basin, the company said Feb. 3. The basin is in the Amazon
rainforest in northern  Brazil .  “The 21 blocks owned by HRT surround Petrobras’ blocks in
the basin, and this new discovery reinforces the potential of
HRT’s portfolio,” Auro Rozenbaum, a Sao Paulo-based analyst at
Banco Bradesco SA, said in a note today to clients. “It may
reverse part of the skepticism created by the results from its
drilling campaign in the Solimoes basin.”  HRT is down 17 percent this year, compared with a 15
percent gain in the Bovespa stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
