Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped for a
second straight day on concern Europe’s debt crisis will slow
global growth and damp demand for exports from Southeast Asia’s
biggest economy. Bonds rose for an eighth day.  Overseas sales climbed 2.2 percent in December from a year
earlier, the smallest increase since September 2009, statistics
department data showed last week. The Dollar Index traded on ICE
Futures in  New York  rose before a deadline for  Greece  to reach a
deal with its creditors.  “There are issues of global economic growth slowing
down,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research
at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore. “It has been showing on
Indonesian export numbers and the currency.”  The rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 8,985 per dollar today as
of 3:50 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.26
percent today, according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association.
The rate dropped 25 basis points last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
