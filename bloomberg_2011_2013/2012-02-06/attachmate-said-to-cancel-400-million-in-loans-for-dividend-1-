Attachmate Corp (ATTM) ., a systems
infrastructure software provider, canceled plans for $400
million in loans to pay a dividend to sponsors, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be
identified because the deal’s private.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of
America Corp. and  Wells Fargo & Co . were arranging the debt,
which included a $300 million incremental first-lien  term loan 
due in April 2017 and a $100 million incremental second-lien
term loan due October 2017, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Joni Kirk, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Attachmate,
declined to comment.  An investor group led by Golden Gate Capital Corp.,
Francisco Partners and Thoma Bravo acquired Attachmate for an
undisclosed amount in June 2005, Bloomberg data show.  First-lien debt is repaid first in a bankruptcy or
liquidation, second-lien debt is repaid next. In a revolving
credit facility, money can be borrowed again once it’s repaid;
in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
