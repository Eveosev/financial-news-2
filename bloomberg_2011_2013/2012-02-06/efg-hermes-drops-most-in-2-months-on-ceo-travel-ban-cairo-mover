EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO) , the largest
publicly traded Arab investment bank, headed for the biggest
loss in more than two months after Chief Executive Officer
Yasser El Mallawany was banned from traveling.  The shares of the Cairo-based firm slumped 5.3 percent to
10.92 Egyptian pounds at 12:58 p.m. in Cairo, poised for the
biggest daily loss since Nov. 22. The stock plunged 63 percent
last year. The  EGX 30 Index , down 49 percent in 2011, lost 1
percent.  EFG-Hermes announced El Mallawany’s travel ban without
providing further information. He discovered the ban while
attempting to travel from Cairo to Dubai,  Al Ahram  reported. El
Mallawany attended the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
Switzerland, last month.  “The news is worrying to some of the retail investors,”
said Omar Darwish, an equity sales trader at Cairo-based
Commercial International Brokerage Co. “But it’s too early to
decide how it will bode for EFG’s operations.”  A call to El Mallawany’s mobile-phone and two calls to
EFG-Hermes’ media office weren’t answered.  EFG-Hermes said a year-ago its relationship with  Gamal
Mubarak , a son of former president  Hosni Mubarak , is limited to
his 18 percent stake in its EFG Private Equity subsidiary, which
contributes “no more than” 7 percent of the company’s group
revenue. The investment bank also said neither EFG-Hermes nor
any of the funds it manages received special privileges or
consideration from the Egyptian government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
