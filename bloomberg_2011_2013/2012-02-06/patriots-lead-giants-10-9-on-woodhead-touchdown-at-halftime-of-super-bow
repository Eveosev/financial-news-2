The  New England Patriots  hold a 10-9
halftime lead over the New York Giants in the  Super Bowl .  The Giants went ahead when Patriots quarterback Tom Brady
was called for intentional grounding while in his own end zone,
resulting in a safety. Victor Cruz then collected a 2-yard
scoring pass from Giants quarterback Eli Manning to make it 9-0
at the end of the first quarter.  Stephen Gostkowski kicked a 29-yard field goal for the
Patriots at the start of the second quarter. Brady then found
Danny Woodhead with a 4-yard touchdown pass eight seconds before
halftime to give the Patriots their first lead of the game.  Each team is seeking a fourth win in the National Football
League championship game. The Giants last claimed the title by
beating the Patriots after the 2007 season, while  New England 
hasnâ€™t won since beating the Philadelphia Eagles following the
2004 campaign.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
