Aperam (APAM) , the stainless-steel producer
spun off by  ArcelorMittal (MT) , posted a second straight quarterly
loss after it sold less metal and prices fell. The company said
the outlook is improving.  The fourth-quarter net loss was $46 million, compared with
a $41 million loss in the prior three months, the Luxembourg-
based company said today in a statement. Revenue slipped 5.5
percent to $1.4 billion.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization declined 15 percent to $53 million, compared with
the three months ended Sept. 30. Aperam said earnings in the
first quarter are expected to improve as stainless steel demand
rebounds.  “Since the beginning of the year, we have started to see
the signs of a rebound in the business, but we continue to
remain cautious considering the global economic uncertainty for
2012,” Philippe Darmayan, chief executive officer, said in the
statement.  European stainless-steel producers, hobbled by excess
capacity in the industry that has raised costs and suppressed
prices, may gain from Outokumpu Oyj’s plans to merge with a unit
of  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  to form the world’s largest maker of the
alloy.  The company created by the Outokumpu deal plans to cut
about 1.4 million metric tons of steelmaking capacity in  Europe 
by shuttering plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
