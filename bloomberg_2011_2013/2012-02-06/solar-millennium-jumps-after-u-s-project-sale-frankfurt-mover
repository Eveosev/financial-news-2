Solar Millennium AG (S2M) , the German
solar-power developer that filed for creditor protection in
December, rose to a one-week high after selling its 2.25
gigawatts of U.S. projects to  Solarhybrid AG. (SHL)   Solar Millennium climbed 3.2 percent to 33 euro cents at
the close in Frankfurt, the highest since Jan. 30, after selling
two project-holding companies, including a 70 percent stake in
its Solar Trust of America unit. Solarhybrid, based in Brilon,
 Germany , advanced 2 percent to 6.53 euros.  Solar Millennium filed for insolvency on Dec. 21, citing
slow progress in selling its U.S. projects and failure to reach
an agreement on bringing in investors for its Ibersol venture in
Spain. Solar Trust is developing a 1-gigawatt facility in
Blythe,  California .  The U.S. project sale is subject to the conclusion of
power-purchase agreements, Erlangen-based Solar Millennium said
in a Feb. 3 statement, without disclosing financial terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
