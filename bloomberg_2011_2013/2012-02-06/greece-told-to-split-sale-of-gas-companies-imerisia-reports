The International Monetary Fund, the
European Union and the  European Central Bank  are insisting that
Greece should sell state-controlled natural gas suppler  DEPA  SA
and its Desfa gas-grid operator separately,  Imerisia  reported.  Separate sales are a requirement set out in Greece’s first
international aid agreement, while the country’s asset sales
 agency  favors a joint sale, the Athens-based newspaper said,
citing unidentified sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
