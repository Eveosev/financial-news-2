Thousands of Australians remain
forced from their homes as floodwaters engulfed the nation’s
north-east, a year after natural disasters cost the economy
about A$9 billion ($9.7 billion).  The Balonne River at  St George , a town of about 3,000
people located 500 kilometers (311 miles) west of the Queensland
state capital, Brisbane, is expected to peak at around 14 meters
(46 feet) today, below a previous forecast of 15 meters,
following deluges in the Australian state.  The river rose to a record 13.85 meters at around 4:00 a.m.
local time today, and is still rising slowly, the Australian
Bureau of Meteorology said on its website. Residents were asked
to leave town over the weekend and yesterday.  The deluge may damage as much as 10 percent of the cotton
crop in  Australia , the world’s third-biggest shipper, according
to Olam International Ltd.  Floods in Queensland and the neighboring state of New South
Wales have caused an estimated A$50 million of damage, New South
Wales Minister for Emergency Management  Robert McClelland  said
in a Feb. 3 statement. About 30,000 properties were affected in
Queensland last year by flooding that left dozens of people dead
and disrupted trade as mines were shut.  The bureau forecast isolated showers and thunderstorms in
Australia’s eastern districts over the next two days. The
rainfall may cause some rises in local streams but isn’t
expected to add to current flooding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
