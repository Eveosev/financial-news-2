Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender by assets, raised  mortgage rates  to reflect
higher funding costs, ending a promotional rate three weeks
before it was set to expire.  Royal Bank will increase its four-year fixed rate mortgage
by 40 basis points to 3.39 percent effective Feb. 8, the
Toronto-based lender said today in a statement. Royal Bank cut
the mortgage rate to 2.99 percent on Jan. 13, following Bank of
Montreal’s move to lower its five-year rate to a record low for
the bank. Royal Bank’s special was set to expire Feb. 29.  “Mortgage rates are tied to the bank’s funding costs,
which change from day to day,” Matt Gierasimczuk, a bank
spokesman, said in an interview. “Our long-term funding costs
have gone up considerably due to global economic concerns and,
while we have held off in passing on these rate changes to our
clients, it is now necessary for us to increase this mortgage
rate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
