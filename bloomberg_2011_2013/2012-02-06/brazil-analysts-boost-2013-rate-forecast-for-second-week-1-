(Corrects to cite estimate for growth this year in fifth
paragraph.)  Analysts covering  Brazil  increased
their 2013 year-end interest rate expectation for a second
straight week as inflation remains above the central bank’s
target.  The benchmark Selic rate will end 2013 at 10.75 percent,
according to the median forecast in a Feb. 3  central bank survey 
of about 100 economists published today, up from an estimate of
10.38 percent the previous week. In Mumbai last week, central
bank President Alexandre Tombini said Brazil still has “some
room” to cut rates from their current level of 10.5 percent.  Consumer prices will increase 5.29 percent this year, the
survey said, up from the previous week’s estimate of 5.28
percent.  Brazil’s central bank said there is a “high” chance that
it will continue to cut its benchmark rate until it is below 10
percent, in the minutes to its Jan. 17-18 policy meeting.
Tombini began cutting borrowing costs in August to protect
Brazil from the European debt crisis, and has signaled he will
continue to do so even after recent data show the economy
accelerating.  Economists raised their estimate for economic growth this
year to 3.3 percent, from 3.27 percent.  Latin America ’s biggest
economy will grow 4.2 percent next year, up from 4.15 percent.
Economic growth slowed to around 3 percent last year from around
7.5 percent in 2010, Tombini said last week.  Annual inflation slowed to 6.5 percent in December, taking
it back within its target range for the first time in eight
months. Brazil  targets  annual consumer price rises of 4.5
percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Statistics in the past month have shown the economy
rebounding, after it contracted in the third quarter for the
first time in more than two years. Brazil’s economic activity
index, a proxy for gross domestic product, expanded at its
fastest pace in 19 months in November, reversing a three-month
contraction, while unemployment fell to a record low of 4.7
percent in December and industrial production rose at the
quickest pace in seven months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
