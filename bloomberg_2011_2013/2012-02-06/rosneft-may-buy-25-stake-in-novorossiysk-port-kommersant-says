OAO Rosneft may buy a 25 percent
stake in OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port currently
controlled by the government,  Kommersant  reported today.  Vice Prime Minister  Igor Sechin , chair of Rosneftâ€™s board,
made the proposal to Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  in a Jan. 31
letter, the Moscow-based newspaper said, citing the letter.  The sale of a 20 percent stake in Novorossiysk Port, which
is owned by the government, has been included in privatization
plans, with the government seeking to hire Morgan Stanley to aid
the sale, Kommersant says. State-controlled Russian Railways
owns an additional 5 percent holding in the port.  Both stakes should be sold to Rosneft directly without a
tender, Sechin suggested, according to Kommersant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
