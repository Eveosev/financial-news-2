U.S. stocks declined, following a
five-week advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, amid
concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis as Greek leaders wrestled
with spending cuts to get aid and avert a default.  Banks  in the S&P 500 dropped 1.1 percent, following a
retreat in European lenders.  Boeing Co. (BA)  decreased 1.2 percent as
it ordered inspections of 787 Dreamliners after finding signs of
fuselage delamination.  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  and  Lennar Corp. (LEN) 
slumped at least 2.3 percent after  Raymond James  Financial Inc.
cut its recommendation for the  homebuilders .  Medco Health
Solutions Inc. (MHS)  tumbled 8.1 percent amid concern that its
proposed acquisition by  Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX)  may be blocked.  The S&P 500 decreased less than 0.1 percent to 1,344.33 as
of 4 p.m. New York time, paring a decline of as much as 0.6
percent as energy companies advanced. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  retreated 17.10 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,845.13.  “It’s an ongoing Greek tragedy,”  Stephen Wood , the New
York-based chief market strategist for Russell Investments, said
in a phone interview. His firm oversees $137.6 billion. “We’re
in the hands of the best efforts of European politicians. That’s
a source of risk that’s difficult to forecast.”  Stocks fell as European leaders stepped up pressure on
Greek politicians to meet the conditions of a 130 billion-euro
($171 billion) bailout, saying time was running out. French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  met German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  as
 Greece ’s interim prime minister,  Lucas Papademos , planned to
confer with the so-called troika of international lenders. A
gathering of Greek political leaders was delayed by a day until
tomorrow as they struggled for a unified response.  Best Start  Today’s decline in equities came after the  S&P 500  capped
the best start to a year since  1987  as a report showed that
employment growth topped estimates and the jobless rate
unexpectedly fell to 8.3 percent. Financial and commodity shares
had the biggest losses among 10 industries.  “Markets are not a very patient beast,” Michael A. Gayed,
chief investment strategist in New York at Pension Partners LLC,
said in a telephone interview. “When you have these talks that
the Greece situation is going to be resolved, then, it gets
postponed, markets get impatient.”  Boeing fell 1.2 percent to $75.46. The new checks add to
challenges in boosting output of the twin-engine 787, which
entered service in 2011 after more than three years of delays.
Boeing said 2012 deliveries for the jet should stay on schedule
after an initial slowdown for inspections. Delamination is a
term for the separation that can occur in a composite material
when its layers crack and lose strength.  Homebuilders Slump  A gauge of homebuilders in S&P indexes slumped 1.7 percent.
Toll Brothers, the largest U.S. luxury-home builder, slid 2.4
percent to $23.28.  Lennar  slid 2.8 percent to $22.69.  KB Home (KBH) 
tumbled 3.5 percent to $10.43. The companies are among those
downgraded at Raymond James, which cited valuation concern.  Medco Health Solutions  tumbled 8.1 percent to $58.47.
Reuters reported that “key people” at the Federal Trade
Commission are seeking to stop the company’s proposed $29.1
billion acquisition by rival pharmacy benefits company  Express
Scripts.  Medco and  Express Scripts  said they still expect to
complete the transaction in the first half of this year. Express
Scripts slumped 4.6 percent to $49.67.  Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S. drugstore chain, gained 1.9
percent to $34.28.  Humana Inc.  slid 5.4 percent to $85.25. The second-largest
Medicare provider raised its 2012 earnings forecast less than
analysts estimated as more Americans were expected to seek
medical care in a recovering economy.  New CEO  Micron Technology Inc. (MU)  retreated 2.8 percent to $7.73. The
company named Mark Durcan as its chief executive officer,
replacing  Steve Appleton , who died on Feb. 3 after crashing an
experimental plane. The shares fell 3.1 percent to $7.70 in late
trading Feb. 3, after having been halted at $7.95.  With today’s drop in stocks, the S&P 500 traded for about
14 times its companies’  earnings  and has been stuck below its
five-decade average multiple of 16.4 since May 2010, the longest
stretch since a 13-year period beginning in  1973 .  Earnings  beat  projections at 66 percent of the 268
companies in the S&P 500 that reported quarterly results since
Jan. 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profits
probably grew 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter, according to a
Bloomberg survey of analysts. The projection has fallen from 6.2
percent at the end of last year.  Energy shares had the  biggest gain  in the S&P 500 among 10
industries, rising 1.1 percent as a group.  Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR) , a coal miner, rallied 3.3 percent to $23.54.
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  added 2.1 percent to $52.09.  Disney, Sprint  Walt Disney Co.  gained 1.2 percent to $40.46. The world’s
biggest theme-park operator was raised to “buy” from
“neutral” at Davenport & Co. by equity analyst  Michael Morris .
The 12-month share-price estimate is $46.  Sprint Nextel Corp.  climbed 6 percent to $2.46. The third-
largest U.S. wireless, scheduled to release its fourth-quarter
results on Feb. 8, offers a buying opportunity for investors
because earnings during the period most likely marked the
trough, Macquarie Group Ltd. said.  Kroger Co.  rose 0.6 percent to $24.06. The largest U.S.
grocery-store chain traded last week at an 86 percent discount
to its projected sales this fiscal year, leaving it cheaper than
99 percent of companies in the S&P 500, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The company, which has increased  sales  in every year since
at least 1987 even as Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
grabbed market share from other supermarkets, may now become a
target for retailers outside the U.S. or private equity firms,
according to Northcoast Research Holdings LLC.  Takeover Offer  Valued at $13.7 billion last week, Kroger could still
attract a takeover offer 30 percent above its current price,
Point View Wealth Management Inc. said, making it the largest
grocery acquisition on record.  “Of the traditional pure-play grocery stores, Kroger is
the crown jewel,” David Dietze, president and chief investment
strategist at Summit, New Jersey-based Point View, which owns
shares of Kroger, said in a telephone interview. “They have a
long consistent record of positive same-store sales performance.
It’s timely to acquire Kroger because it’s cheap.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
