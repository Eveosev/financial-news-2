Ecuador ’s consumer prices rose the
most for four months in January, led by increases in alcohol,
tobacco and transport costs, following an 11 percent jump in the
Andean country’s minimum wage.  Consumer prices rose 0.57 percent from December and 5.29
percent from a  year  earlier, the National Statistics and Census
Institute said in a report on its  website  today. Producer prices
in January rose 2.09 percent month-on-month and climbed 4.16
percent from the previous year, the report said.  Prices in Ecuador, which uses the  U.S. dollar  as its
official currency, are rising after the government lifted the
minimum wage, boosting local demand and driving up prices while
increasing manufacturers’ wage costs, former Finance Minister
Alfredo Arizaga and now head economist at Quito-based think tank
Quantum Informe, said in an e-mailed report Feb. 1.  January’s CPI increase was the biggest since September’s
0.79 percent.  Prices jumped the most in the coastal city of Machala,
quickening 1.15 percent in January from the previous month while
they were little changed in the nation’s largest city,
Guayaquil, rising 0.02 percent, the agency said. Ecuador, the
smallest member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, subsidizes fuel costs and the domestic use of natural
gas.  Consumer price inflation is forecast to average 5.14
percent this year compared with 4.7 percent in 2011 while the
economy may expand 5.35 percent, according to the  Finance
Ministry ’s 2012 budget.  In December, the central bank said Ecuador’s economy, South
America’s seventh-biggest, expanded 9 percent in the third
quarter after growing 9.3 percent in the second, the most since
June 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
