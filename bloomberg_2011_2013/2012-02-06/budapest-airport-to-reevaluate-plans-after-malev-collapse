Budapest Airport Zrt., the operator
of  Hungary â€™s chief international airport, majority-owned by
 Hochtief AG (HOT) , is to reevaluate its 2012 business plan following
the bankruptcy of its largest customer, state-owned carrier
Malev Zrt., the airport said.  Malev collapsed on Feb. 3 and the airport said it expects
the government to remove obstacles preventing other carriers
from picking up the lost Malev capacity, the company said in an
e-mailed statement late yesterday.  The cabinet should designate an airline replacing Malev to
fly routes where the folded carrier had exclusive rights, such
as Russia,  Turkey , Israel or Ukraine, according to the
statement.  European carriers such as British Airways Plc.,  Air France-
KLM (AF) , Brussels Airlines,  Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Air Berlin AG,  Ryanair
Holdings Plc. (RYA) , and Budapest-based Wizz Air announced capacity
expansions and new routes, the airport operator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
