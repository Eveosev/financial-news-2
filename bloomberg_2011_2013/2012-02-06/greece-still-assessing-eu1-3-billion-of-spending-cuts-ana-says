Greece is still assessing 1.3 billion
euros ($1.7 billion) of spending cuts for 2012 to satisfy
demands from the European Union and  International Monetary Fund 
for a new financing package, Athens  News Agency  reported,
without saying how it got the information.  The cuts are part of total spending reductions of 3.3
billion euros requested by the EU and IMF, the state-run news
agency reported. The government has so far decided to cut health
spending by 1.1 billion euros, defense by 400 million euros and
make 440 million euros of savings from cuts to subsidies for
local government authorities, ANA said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
