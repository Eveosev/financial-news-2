Egypt  will let candidates start
registering on March 10 for the first presidential election
since the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak , the state-run Ahram Gate news
website reported, citing the head of the elections commission
Abdel Moez Ibrahim.  State media reported last month that candidatesâ€™
registration would start on April 15. The military council,
during a meeting today with the commission, asked the panel to
speed the presidential vote and allow for registration as soon
as possible, Ahram Gate cited Ibrahim as saying without giving a
date for the election.  Moving up the elections date would meet demands by some
protesters calling for expediting a  power transfer  to civilians,
though it may do little to appease those who want the council to
immediately cede power.  Activists say the military council is mismanaging the
transition and using Mubarak-style tactics to stifle dissent.
The council has previously said it would cede power only when a
president is elected by the end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
