Tokyo Electric Power Co . said the
temperature of the No. 2 reactor at its damaged Fukushima
nuclear plant has risen and it injected boric acid into the unit
early this morning to prevent criticality.  It took the step between 12:19 a.m. and 3:20 a.m. today,
according to an e-mailed statement.  Tepco yesterday said it had been increasing the amount of
coolant circulated into the reactor since Feb. 3 to counter the
rising temperature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
