Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s largest oil
company, was the biggest loser on the country’s benchmark  Ibex
35 Index (IBEX)  today on news that its YPF Argentine business will lose
financial incentives intended to boost investments.  Repsol  dropped  4.1 percent to 20.28 euros in Madrid, the
steepest decline in almost a month. Argentina’s Planning
Ministry said Feb. 3 that it will stop a three-year program that
provided about 10 billion pesos ($2.3 billion) of incentives to
 oil companies .  “This seems to be part of a standoff between the
government and the company,” Stuart Joyner, a London-based
analyst at Investec Securities, said by phone today. “The value
of the subsidies for the industry is not huge, but the impact
has more to do with a potential nationalization of YPF.”  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  is stepping up
pressure on YPF, controlled by Madrid-based Repsol, to cut
dividends, boost investment and restrain prices as fuel imports
and capital flight surge. Government officials, lawmakers and
oil industry specialists discussed a possible renationalization
of YPF on several recent occasions, Pagina/12 reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
