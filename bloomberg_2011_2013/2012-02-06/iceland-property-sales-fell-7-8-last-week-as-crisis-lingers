Iceland property sales fell 7.8
percent last week as the fallout of the island’s 2008 banking
crisis lingers.  There were 94 homes and commercial properties sold in the
week through Feb. 2, compared with 102 sales the previous week,
according to an e-mailed statement today from Reykjavik-based
 Registers Iceland . Properties sold fell 12 percent to 2.2
billion kronur ($17.8 million), the office said.  Iceland’s 2008 banking meltdown left in its wake a burst
property bubble that wrecked the economy. Housing, measured as a
subcomponent in the country’s consumer price index, has yet to
regain pre-crisis values and prices remain about 3 percent below
levels in September 2008, one month before the country’s biggest
banks failed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
