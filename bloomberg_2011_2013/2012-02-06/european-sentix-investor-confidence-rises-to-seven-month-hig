European investor confidence rose to
a seven-month high in February after the  European Central Bank ’s
liquidity measures soothed credit-crunch concerns, the Sentix
research institute said.  An index measuring sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
increased to minus 11.1 from minus 21.1 in January, Limburg,
Germany-based Sentix said in an e-mailed statement today. A
gauge of expectations surged to minus 6.3 from minus 23.5, while
an indicator for current conditions rose to minus 15.8 from
minus 18.8.  The ECB’s three-year loans to banks were “apparently a
game-changer for investors,” Sentix said in the statement.
“Most recent data suggest that markets will face further
positive economic surprises.”  Business confidence in  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy,
jumped to a five-month high in January and bond yields from
Italy to  Spain  are sliding, adding to signs the region will
avoid a protracted recession. The ECB will hold another three-
year tender on Feb. 28 after banks snapped up a record 489
billion euros ($639 billion) in December.  Sentix said 956 investors participated in its monthly
survey, which was conducted Feb. 2-4. The results are never
revised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
