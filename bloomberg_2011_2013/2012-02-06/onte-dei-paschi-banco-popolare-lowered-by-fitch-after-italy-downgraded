Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA 
and  Banco Popolare SC (BP)  were among Italian banks to have their
credit grades cut by Fitch Ratings after Italy was downgraded
last month.  Monte dei Paschi, Italy’s third-biggest bank, and Verona-
based Banco Popolare had their debt downgraded to BBB from BBB+,
Fitch said today in a statement. Iccrea Holding SpA and  Unione
di Banche Italiane ScpA (UBI)  also were cut to BBB+ from A-, and
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  was reduced to A- from A.  European nations are grappling with a debt crisis now in
its third year as they seek to restore budget order. Fitch
lowered Italy’s credit to A- on Jan. 27, two weeks after
Standard & Poor’s stripped France of its top grade, leaving
 Germany  as the sole nation in the euro area with a stable top
rating of AAA.  “Given the close link between bank and sovereign risk on
both sides of banks’ balance sheets, the key factors that drove
the Italian sovereign action also contributed to the downgrades
and negative outlooks on the Italian banks,” Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
