German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  proposed setting up a separate
account for Greek debt payments to reassure creditors.  Merkel said sequestering aid in such an account would give
the Greek government guaranteed access to funds to finance its
interest obligations. Sarkozy said it will “allow us to assure
that the Greek debt is dealt with,” as both urged Greek leaders
to agree to conditions set out by international creditors.  The German and French leaders, who spoke to reporters after
a joint Cabinet meeting in Paris today, didn’t elaborate on the
special fund. A Sarkozy aide said the idea was a work in
progress and that part of financial assistance to  Greece  could
be placed into a blocked account and earmarked for interest
payments or principal.  European leaders and investors are awaiting the outcome of
negotiations in Athens as Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos
struck a tentative deal with political parties on austerity
measures. The impending agreement is a condition for the
completion of a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion) rescue package.  Greece’s efforts to win a second bailout from the so-called
troika -- the European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and
the  International Monetary Fund  -- have hung in the balance over
the past three days as negotiations in Athens failed to clinch
an agreement. Greece faces a 14.5 billion-euro bond payment on
March 20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
