Greece  needs a “technical solution”
that will allow it to leave the euro, Latvian Finance Minister
Andris Vilks said, according to Dienas Bizness.  Officially no one will agree that Greece needs to leave,
though the option is being studied more and more, Vilks said,
according to the newspaper. Without Greece the rest of the euro-
zone countries would be able to support each other, he said,
