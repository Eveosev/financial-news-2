A U.S. citizen employed by  Intermoor
Inc. , a closely held Houston-based oil-services provider, was
fatally shot in  Venezuela  on Jan. 27, according to the attorney
general’s office.  Craig Dwayne Cormier, 36, was caught in crossfire at 11:30
p.m. in the city of Carupano in eastern Sucre state, the
attorney general’s office said in a statement today. He had
arrived in Venezuela two days earlier to conduct repair work on
the Turquoise vessel that services an offshore platform owned by
state-oil company  Petroleos de Venezuela SA , according to the
statement.  The  murder rate  has almost tripled to 67 per 100,000
inhabitants, the highest in South America, since President  Hugo Chavez  took power in 1999, according to the Venezuelan Violence
Observatory. The government says the murder rate is lower.  Joe Herbet, an operations manager for Intermoor in  Morgan
City , Louisiana, said today in a telephone interview that the
company couldn’t immediately respond to the information released
from the attorney general’s office.  Venezuela has apprehended a suspect in the shooting,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
