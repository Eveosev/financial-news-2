Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR) ,  Africa ’s
third-largest producer of the metal, said second-quarter profit
more than doubled as the local-currency price of the metal rose.  Earnings excluding one-time items rose to 1 billion rand
($129 million), or 2.42 rand a share, in the three months
through December from 411 million rand, or 95 cents a share, in
the prior three months, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today. The average estimate of five analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was for earnings of 1.54 rand a share.  Gold companies in  South Africa , the continent’s largest
producer of the metal, gain from a weaker rand because they sell
much of their output for dollars and pay most costs in rand. The
nation’s currency depreciated 18 percent against the dollar last
year, making it the world’s worst performer after Turkey’s lira,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Harmony and larger rivals  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Gold
Fields Ltd. (GFI)  benefited from a 34 percent jump in the local price
of gold over the year as the rand sank. Harmony gains most from
a weaker rand as it mines about 90 percent of its gold in South
Africa.  The company’s production rose 5 percent to 344,592 ounces
in the quarter, from 328,162 ounces in the previous three
months.  Analysts who track South African gold producers measure
quarter-on-quarter earnings excluding one-time items.  To contact the reporter on this story:
