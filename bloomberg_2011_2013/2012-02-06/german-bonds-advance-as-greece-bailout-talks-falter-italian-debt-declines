Germany ’s bonds rose, with 10-year
yields falling the most in three weeks, as  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said  Greece  is running out of time to reach an agreement
with international lenders to obtain another bailout.  Ten-year bunds advanced for the first time in four days as
a gathering of Greek political leaders was delayed until
tomorrow as they struggled for a unified response to the demands
of the European Commission,  International Monetary Fund  and
 European Central Bank . Dutch notes also rallied as investors
sought safer assets.  French (GFRN2)  two-year yields reached a record low
as the country auctioned bills.  “The Greek deadline is looming over the markets and the
uncertainty helps underpin demand for bunds,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt .
“No one is convinced yet that an agreement will go through.”  The German 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.89 percent at 4:28 p.m. London time after
dropping as much as eight basis points, the most since Jan. 13.
The 2 percent bond due January 2022 climbed 0.35, or 3.50 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,311) face amount, to 100.945.  Greece’s stability has been at stake as efforts to win a
second bailout from the so-called troika -- the European
Commission, the ECB and IMF -- hung in the balance. The country
has a 14.5 billion-euro bond payment due on March 20.  “I can’t quite understand why we need a few more days --
time is running out,” Merkel said today in a joint briefing
with French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in Paris.  ‘Going Wrong’  Euro-area finance chiefs told Greek Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos in a Feb. 4 conference call that an increase
in the bailout package wasn’t forthcoming, underscoring their
frustration at a lack of progress on fixing the economy.  “If we determine that it’s all going wrong in Greece,
then there won’t be a new program -- and that means in March
you’ll have a declaration of bankruptcy,” Luxembourg’s Jean- Claude Juncker, who chairs euro-region finance meetings, told
 Der Spiegel  magazine in an interview published yesterday.  German bonds have gained 11 percent in the past year as the
European debt crisis worsened, according to indexes compiled by
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg. Dutch bonds also gained 11 percent, while Greek
securities tumbled 64 percent, the indexes show.  Dutch Notes  Dutch bonds advanced as the nation auctioned 2.2 billion
euros of bills.  The nation sold 1.1 billion euros of 79-day securities at a
yield of 0.032 percent and 1.09 billion euros of 174-day bills
at 0.05 percent. The rates were higher than previous auctions of
similar-maturity securities on Jan. 3 and Dec. 5 respectively,
which were sold at zero percent and 0.002 percent.  “We are continuing to see a safe-haven bid and that’s
supporting the bonds of the AAA countries” such as the
Netherlands, said Elwin de Groot, a market economist at Rabobank
Nederland in Utrecht. “Greece is a clear example of the
complexity of the issues facing  Europe .”  The Dutch 10-year yield dropped four basis points to 2.21
percent after declining to a euro-era record 2.02 percent on
Jan. 16.  The Netherlands is scheduled to sell as much as 5 billion
euros of 10-year bonds tomorrow. Germany will auction five-year
notes the following day.  French two-year yields fell to 0.569 percent, the lowest
since Bloomberg started tracking the data in 1990, before being
little changed at 0.6 percent.  Greek Bonds  Greek 10-year bonds advanced for a second day with the
yield declining 19 basis points to 34 percent. The price rose
0.15 to 20.79 percent of face value. The nation’s two-year note
yield climbed 12.4 percentage points to 196.9 percent.  Greece plans to sell 625 million euros of six-month bills
tomorrow.  Volatility on Greek debt was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by  Finland , according to measures of 10-
year bonds, two- and 10-year spreads and credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
