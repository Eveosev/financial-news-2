Turkey â€™s governing  Justice and
Development Party  would get 54 percent of the votes due to
increased popularity among nationalist voters in central Turkey,
Vatan said, citing a survey by A&G Arastirma.  The pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party would win more
than 8 percent of the vote should an election be held today, the
poll said, according to the Istanbul-based newspaper. A&G
interviewed 7,000 households, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
