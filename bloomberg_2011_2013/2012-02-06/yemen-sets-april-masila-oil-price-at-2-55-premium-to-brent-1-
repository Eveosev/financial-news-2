Yemen increased the premium for April
shipments of  Masila (YOSPMASI)  Blend oil to $2.55 a barrel above the
European benchmark Dated Brent crude, from $2.15 in March, the
state oil committee said.  The U.K. unit of China International United Petroleum &
Chemical Corp., known as Unipec, was awarded the entire volume
of 2.4 million barrels of Masila for April, the committee said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The country also set the price of Marib Light crude oil at
parity to Dated Brent, unchanged from March, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
