OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel, a
Russian steel producer controlled by billionaire Victor
Rashnikov, may sell a 51 percent stake in its iron ore unit
because of shareholder conflicts,  Kommersant  said today, citing
people it didnâ€™t identified.  The stake in Bakalskoye Rudoupravleniye, as the unit is
called, may be valued at about $120 million, the newspaper said.
Magnitogorsk is seeking to hire a bank to help find a buyer
after it failed to resolve a conflict with owners of the
remaining 49 percent of the unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
