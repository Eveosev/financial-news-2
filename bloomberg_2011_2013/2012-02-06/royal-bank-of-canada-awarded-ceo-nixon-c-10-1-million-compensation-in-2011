Royal Bank of Canada  cut Chief
Executive Officer Gordon Nixon’s 2011 total direct compensation
by 8.3 percent from a year earlier after the lender missed some
financial targets, the bank said.  Nixon, 55, received C$10.1 million ($10.1 million),
including a salary of C$1.48 million, short-term incentives of
C$1.75 million, performance deferred share units of C$5.14
million and stock options worth C$1.71 million, Canada’s largest
bank said today in a regulatory filing. That compares with C$11
million in total compensation a year earlier. Amounts exclude
pensions.  Nixon fell short of his targeted short-term incentive
because of a writedown tied to the sale of its U.S. retail
banking unit, RBC Bank, the Toronto-based lender said. He met or
exceeded his risk, strategic and operations objectives for the
year.  “RBC’s board of directors endorsed Mr. Nixon’s leadership
and strong results,” Royal Bank spokeswoman Katherine Gay said
in an interview. “In determining his compensation, the board
took a balanced, conservative approach, and weighed both RBC’s
record earnings from continuing operations and the impact of the
sale of the U.S. retail bank.”  Royal Bank agreed in June to sell RBC Bank to PNC Financial
Services Group Inc., and took a loss of C$1.57 billion from the
sale of the money-losing unit. PNC agreed to pay $3.62 billion
in cash and stock to buy the Raleigh, North Carolina-based bank
and credit card assets in a deal expected to be completed by
March.  Profit Fell  The bank’s  net income  fell 7.1 to C$4.85 billion in the
fiscal year ending Oct. 31. Royal Bank is the first of  Canada ’s
largest lenders to report on executive compensation.  Royal Bank gave Mark Standish, the New York-based co-head
of RBC Capital Markets investment bank, about C$8.17 million for
last year, down 21 percent from 2010, according to the filing.
Doug McGregor, Standish’s Toronto-based co-head, was awarded
C$8.2 million, down 19 percent from 2010.  David McKay, group head of Canadian banking, earned C$4.71
million for 2011, an increase of 9.5 percent from C$4.3 million
in the prior year. Janice Fukakusa, chief administrative officer
and chief financial officer, received C$3.93 million last year,
a 3 percent increase from 2010.  Royal Bank rose 0.3 percent to C$53.47 in Toronto trading.
The shares have gained 2.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
