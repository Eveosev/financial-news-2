Policy makers can’t rely on a single
measure of the impact of changes to U.S. fiscal policy and must
weigh myriad factors, including the stage of the business cycle,
when considering shifts to spending or taxation, a Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco economist said.  “As many countries pivot from stimulus to austerity
despite uncertain recovery, the question of the economic effects
of higher taxes and reductions in  government spending  takes on a
new importance,” Daniel J. Wilson, a senior economist at the
San Francisco Fed, said in a review of the economic research on
the subject. “It’s essential to clearly understand the context
in which fiscal policy is operating.”  Many factors determine the impact of a fiscal policy
change, including the type of policy under consideration,
whether monetary policy counteracts or complements the policy,
whether the economy is in recession and how the policy would
affect expectations for future spending and taxes, Wilson said.  “The impact varies widely depending on the specific fiscal
policies put into effect and the overall economic environment,”
Wilson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
