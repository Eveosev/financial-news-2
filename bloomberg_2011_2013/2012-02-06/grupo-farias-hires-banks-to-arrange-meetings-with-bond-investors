Grupo Farias, a Brazilian ethanol and
sugar producer, hired Banco Bradesco SA, Deutsche Bank AG and
UBS AG to arrange meetings with bond investors, according to a
person familiar with the discussions.  The meetings will run from today until Feb. 8, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions
are private.  Grupo Farias plans to sell $300 million of seven-year
senior unsecured notes, Moodyâ€™s Investors Service said in a
statement Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
