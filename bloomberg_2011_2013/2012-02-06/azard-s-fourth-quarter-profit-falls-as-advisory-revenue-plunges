Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the largest independent
merger adviser, fell the most since December after reporting a
99 percent plunge in fourth-quarter profit on a decrease in
revenue from working on deals.  Lazard  declined  $1.22, or 4.2 percent, to $27.67 in  New
York . Net income tumbled to $1.4 million, or 1 cent a share,
from $104.5 million, or 76 cents, in the same period a year
earlier, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm said today in a
statement. The average  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for profit of 38 cents.  “We saw turmoil in the markets beginning in the summer,
and by the mid fourth-quarter, you were really feeling the
impact of that,” Chief Executive Officer  Kenneth Jacobs , 53,
said today in a phone interview after results were announced.
“Things that were started didn’t get completed. Things that
were almost done got pushed off. That’s the nature of what
happens when you get periods of turmoil.”  Global announced deal volume fell in the third and fourth
quarters as a downgrade of  U.S. debt  and the European sovereign-
debt crisis stoked investor concern of a worldwide recession.
Lazard ranked ninth on the financial advisory league tables last
year, overseeing $232.6 billion in announced transactions,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lazard’s  revenue  from mergers and acquisitions declined 36
percent to $167.1 million from the year earlier, according to
the statement. Financial advisory revenue, which includes fees
from overseeing M&A, capital markets and restructuring, fell 26
percent to $260.5 million in the fourth quarter from the same
period a year earlier. Full-year revenue for the segment
decreased 11 percent to $992.2 million.  Discretionary Bonuses Cut  Lazard advised on some of the world’s largest announced
deals last year, including Medco Health Solutions Inc. on its
$34.3 billion proposed sale to Express Scripts Inc. and Progress
Energy Inc. on its $25.5 billion announced sale to Duke Energy
Corp.  Asset management revenue was $204.4 million in the three
months-ended Dec. 31, down from $255.7 million. Full-year
revenue from the unit rose 6 percent to $882.8 million.  Lazard cut discretionary bonuses by about 20 percent in
2011, the firm said in the statement. The company set aside $337
million in compensation expenses for the fourth quarter,
compared with $347.7 million in the same period a year earlier.  The “burden of deferred grants” made in 2008 will make it
“challenging” for Lazard to reach a compensation-to-revenue
ratio in the mid-50 percent range in 2012, Jacobs said today on
a conference call after results were announced. Lazard kept its
deferral rate constant in 2011 from 2010, Jacobs said.  Getting Off ‘Treadmill’  “The decision on the deferrals was, we just want to get
off this treadmill,” he said. “They keep deferring, which just
have made this harder and harder each year, and eventually I
just don’t think this is the right way to manage the business.”  Lazard’s full-year  net income  fell 36 percent to $178.6
million, or $1.31 per share, from $281.1 million, or $2.06, in
2010, according to the statement.  Lazard repurchased $206 million of shares in 2011,
according to the statement. The firm increased its quarterly
 dividend  payable in April by 25 percent to 20 cents per share.  Lazard’s competitors reported increases in fourth-quarter
profit.  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the advisory firm founded by
former U.S. Deputy Treasury secretary  Roger Altman , said Feb. 2
that net income increased 29 percent, and  Greenhill & Co. 
reported on Jan. 26 that profit increased eightfold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
