Spanish renewable-energy projects
may be awarded in the future through auctions, Cinco Dias
reported, citing language in the January royal decree that
eliminated guaranteed subsidies.  The law champions “a new model for retribution” in which
“resources are assigned through market mechanisms,” the report
said.  While  Spain ’s new industry minister, Jose Manuel Soria, has
insisted that the halt to subsidies for renewable-energy
projects is temporary, the law says nothing about temporality,
Cinco Dias reported. Instead it “alludes to” an auction system
in which the top bidder wins the right to carry out the project,
the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
