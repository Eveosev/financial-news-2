Egyptian authorities banned  EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO)  Chief Executive Officer Yasser El-Mallawany
from travel, the state-run news website  Al Ahram  Gate reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  El-Mallawany discovered the ban while attempting to travel
from Cairo to Dubai, Al Ahram reported. EFG-Hermes is the
biggest publicly traded Arab investment bank.  EFG-Hermes didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail from
Bloomberg News seeking comment. A telephone call to the
company’s Cairo office before business hours wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
