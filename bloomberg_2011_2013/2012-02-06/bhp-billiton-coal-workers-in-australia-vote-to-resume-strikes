(Corrects spelling of Steve Pierce’s name in story
published on Feb. 6 in second paragraph.)  BHP Billiton Ltd. ’s coking coal
miners in  Australia , the world’s largest exporter, voted to
resume striking after rejecting the company’s latest offer on
employment and accommodation.  Workers voted to reject the offer on Feb. 3 and may strike
for as many as seven straight days at seven of BHP’s coal
operations in Queensland state, Steve Pierce, district vice
president of the  Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy
Union , said today by phone. The unions have not yet set a date
for the stoppages to commence, he said.  About 3,500 workers at BHP’s mines in Queensland’s Bowen
Basin have held rolling strikes since June over pay and
conditions, before suspending industrial action in December to
resume contract talks. Labor unions globally are stepping up
demands for higher wages and improved conditions as record
commodity prices swell profits at mining companies.  “The company cannot, and will not, diminish its rights and
obligations to manage the business, nor will we accept
productivity-destroying arrangements as currently proposed by
the unions,” Kelly Quirke, a Melbourne-based spokeswoman for
BHP said by phone. “Strike action will not change our position,
as has been the case for the past eight months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
