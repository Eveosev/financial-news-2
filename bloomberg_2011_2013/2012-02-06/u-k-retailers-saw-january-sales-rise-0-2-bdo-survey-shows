U.K. mid-sized retailers saw their
sales rise 0.2 percent year-on-year in January, according to BDO
LLP’s High Street Sales Tracker.  The index, which covers retailers with sales between 5
million pounds ($7.9 million) and 500 million pounds, saw non-
fashion sales increase 2.4 percent, while fashion sales fell 0.8
percent.  “Overall, these figures are better than expected,” BDO’s
head of retail and wholesale,  Don Williams , said in an e-mailed
statement. “Behind the numbers we are seeing an increasing
polarization in the performance of high street retailers. The
chasm between the high performers and the strugglers is widening
every month.”  A separate survey by PriceWaterHouseCoopers found U.K.
households reduced their unsecured borrowing by an average 355
pounds during 2011. It now stands at 8,000 pounds per household.  To contact the reporters on this story:
