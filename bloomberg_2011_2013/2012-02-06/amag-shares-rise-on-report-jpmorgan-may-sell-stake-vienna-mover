AMAG Austria Metall AG (AMAG)  rose to the
highest level in almost eight months on a report that  JPMorgan
Chase & Co . may sell its remaining stake in the Austrian
aluminum producer.  Shares increased 4.5 percent to 18.155 euros at the 5:30
p.m. close of trading in Vienna, the highest since May 18. AMAG
has advanced 15 percent this year, valuing the company at 640
million euros ($840 million).  One Equity Partners LLC, JPMorgan’s buyout arm, is in talks
to sell its 34.5 percent stake in AMAG, Oberoesterreichische
Nachrichten reported on Feb. 4, without saying where it got the
information.  One Equity is negotiating with several potential buyers
including Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberoesterreich AG, which
acquired an 11.5 percent stake in AMAG’s initial public offering
last year, and B&C Industrieholding GmbH, the Linz, Austria-
based paper said. A sale may take place in a few weeks,
according to the report.  AMAG will report “very good” profit that beat
expectations and a “nice” dividend in early March, OOeN also
reported, citing unidentified people in the company’s
supervisory board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
