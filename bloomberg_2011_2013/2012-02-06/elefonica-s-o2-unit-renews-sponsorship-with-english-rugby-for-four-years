Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s O2 mobile telephone
unit agreed to renew its sponsorship of England’s rugby squads
for four years.  The telephone company has backed the England team since the
sport went professional in 1995, and its name will be on the
mens’ and womens’ team jerseys during the 2015  World Cup , the
Rugby Football Union said today in an e-mailed statement.  O2 will make tickets available to customers and will
sponsor rugby events in the community as part of the agreement,
the RFU said.  The Telefonica unit had 22.2 million mobile customers in
the U.K. at the end of September and 800,000 fixed broadband
users.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
