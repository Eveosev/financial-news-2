Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , the largest
U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer by market value,
reached its highest price after fourth-quarter profit exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  Anadarko  climbed  5.2 percent to $87.21 at the close in  New
York , the highest price since it began trading in 1986. The
company yesterday reported per-share profit that, excluding the
cost of writing down coalbed-methane properties and other one-
time items, was 37 percent more than the average of 27 analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Output rose 12 percent to the equivalent of  683,000 barrels
of oil  a day during the last three months of 2011, The
Woodlands, Texas-based company said. Sales volumes climbed to 63
million barrels at an average price of $104.82 a barrel of oil
and condensate, more than the $98 estimate from Raymond James &
Associates Inc.  “It looks like it’s a combination of pricing and
production,” Andrew Coleman, an analyst at  Raymond James  in
Houston who has a “strong buy” on Anadarko shares and doesn’t
own any, said in a telephone interview yesterday.  The company reported a net loss of $358 million, or 72
cents a share, compared with a profit of $111 million, or 22
cents, a year earlier. The loss stems in part from about $1
billion in charges for coalbed-methane holdings in the Powder
River Basin of  Wyoming ,  John Christiansen , a spokesman, said in
a phone interview. Low gas prices reduced their value, he said.  Revenue Rises  Revenue in the fourth quarter climbed 43 percent from a
year earlier to $3.84 billion.  The company said on a conference call today it’s seeking to
sell assets in  Indonesia  as well as gas properties in South
 Texas  and it expects bids on its Brazilian assets in the next
few weeks.  Anadarko is developing U.S. onshore projects in the Eagle
Ford and Marcellus shale formations. The company also is looking
to boost production from the  Gulf of Mexico  and off the coast of
 Africa  in future years.  Shale projects totaled more than 10 percent of Anadarko’s
sales volumes at the end of 2011, compared with less than 1
percent at the start of 2010, the company said. Daily production
from the Eagle Ford in Texas was about 77,000 barrels of oil
equivalent at the end of 2011, more than 65 percent of which was
petroleum liquids, Anadarko said.  Gulf Projects  Off the coast of  Ghana , the Jubilee project had output of
about 70,000 barrels a day at the end of the fourth quarter,
Anadarko said in an operations report yesterday. Production may
increase to 90,000 barrels a day this year.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , a
partner in the project, said in January that Jubilee may reach
120,000 barrels of oil in 2013.  The El Merk development in  Algeria  is about 88 percent
finished and “significant oil volumes” are possible near the
end of the year, according to yesterday’s statement. Anadarko’s
Caesar/Tonga project in the Gulf is moving toward crude
production by mid-2012 and first oil may come from Lucius in
2014.  Anadarko last year agreed to pay  BP Plc (BP/)  $4 billion to
settle claims related to the 2010 explosion and oil spill at the
Macondo well in the U.S. Gulf. Quarterly operating cash flow was
affected by $3.87 billion in settlement and related costs, the
company said.  Anadarko expects Gulf exploration this year will return to
levels it reached before a U.S. moratorium on deep-water
drilling was imposed because of Macondo.  Independent producers don’t own refining, chemical or
retail-fuel businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
