The Islamic Hamas movement and
secular Fatah party agreed that Palestinian Authority President
Mahmoud Abbas will head an interim joint government until
elections are held in the  West Bank  and  Gaza Strip , according to
two people close to the negotiations, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the details are still incomplete.  Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal are scheduled to
discuss the proposed agreement at a meeting today in Doha,
Qatar, according to spokesmen for both leaders.  The Bethlehem-based Maan news agency said Abbas, chairman
of Fatah, was proposed as prime minister of the interim
government to resolve a longstanding disagreement with Hamas
over the choice.  Hamas, which is regarded as a terrorist organization by
Israel, the U.S. and the European Union, and Fatah signed an
agreement in Cairo last May to create the interim government and
hold elections within one year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
