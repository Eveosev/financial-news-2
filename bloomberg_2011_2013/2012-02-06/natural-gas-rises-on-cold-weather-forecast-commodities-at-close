The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index
of 24  raw materials  rose 0.3 percent to 668.53 at 4:15 p.m. in
 New York  as natural gas, heating oil and sugar climbed.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices increased 0.2
percent to 1,612.523.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures rose in New York for the second time in
three days as forecasts showed colder weather moving across the
U.S., signaling increased demand for the heating fuel.  Temperatures may be below normal over central and western
states in the next two weeks, according to the  National Weather
Service . Private forecasts predict a brief cold spell followed
by mild temperatures in mid-February east of the  Rocky
Mountains .  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , natural gas for March
delivery rose 2 percent, or 5.1 cents, to settle at $2.55 per
million British thermal units. Prices have fallen 15 percent
this year and slid to $2.231 per million Btu on Jan. 23, the
lowest intraday price since February 2002.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil climbed to the highest level in 11 weeks as
cold weather in  Europe  boosted gasoil futures prices.  Futures gained as front-month gasoil on ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London rose to a premium to the next month for the
first time in three weeks after a cold snap in Europe boosted
demand for the home-heating fuel.  March-delivery heating oil rose 5.63 cents to close at
$3.1707 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest price since Nov. 15.  Gasoil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange increased $28.75, or 3 percent, to $989.50 a metric
ton. Prices touched $991, the highest level for the contract
since November, increasing the demand for U.S. fuel exports.  Gasoline for March delivery gained 1.35 cents to close at
$2.9279 a gallon on the Nymex.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Sugar rose to a one-week high as rain cut supplies from
 Thailand , the world’s second-largest exporter, while crops are
delayed in Brazil, the top producer.  Thailand’s sugar production fell 1.9 percent to 4.57
million metric tons in the first 78 days of the season that
began on Nov. 15, according to data from the Office of Cane and
Sugar Board. Brazil’s sugar-cane output is delayed after two
frosts in June killed crops maturing for the next harvest,
according to Raizen, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell Plc
and Cosan SA Industria e Comercio.  Raw sugar for March delivery jumped 2.3 percent to settle
at 24.5 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery rose 1.3 percent
to close at $2.188 a pound on ICE. Cocoa futures for March
delivery declined 1.6 percent to $2,263 a ton in New York.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat futures gained for the first time in three sessions
on speculation that cold weather in  France ,  Germany  and Ukraine
will damage dormant crops.  Temperatures reached minus 15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees
Fahrenheit) in France’s Alsace and Lorraine regions yesterday,
according to forecaster Meteo France. In northern Germany, where
some fields lack a protective layer of snow, soil temperatures
have dropped below minus 8 degrees Celsius, Deutscher
Wetterdienst said.  Cold weather in the  Black Sea region  also has hurt crops.  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 1.2 percent to
$6.685 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices fell 2
percent in the previous two sessions and are down 22 percent
from a year ago.  Soybeans rose, capping the longest rally in five weeks, as
 China ’s demand for U.S. supplies increased after unusually dry
weather reduced output in  South America .  Oilseed processors in China, the world’s largest consumer,
ordered 10 cargoes last week from the U.S. for March delivery
because prices were more competitive than South American costs,
according to Grain.gov.cn.  Argentina ’s crop will fall to 46.5 million metric tons,
down from 49 million a year earlier, and farmers in  Brazil  will
harvest 70 million, down from 75.5 million, Informa Economics
Inc. said Feb. 3.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to close at $12.33 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, capping the first five-session rally since late December.  Corn futures for March delivery fell less than 0.1 percent
to $6.4425 a bushel, snapping a four-session rally. On Feb. 1,
the price touched $6.50, the highest since Jan. 12, on
speculation that dry weather would reduce South American yields.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures fell for the third straight session on
speculation U.S. pork supplies will outpace demand.  Meatpackers slaughtered an estimated 419,000 hogs, up 4.8
percent from a week earlier, according to a U.S. Department of
Agriculture report.  Hog carcasses averaged 210 pounds (95 kilograms) Feb. 3,
the highest since Jan. 13, government data show. On that date,
the average weight reached 212 pounds, the highest since at
least 2002.  Hog futures for April settlement fell 0.4 percent to settle

since Jan. 19. The commodity has climbed 5 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement dropped 0.2
percent to $1.54125 a pound.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fell to the lowest price in more than a week as the
dollar rallied, curbing demand for the metal as an alternative
investment.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  climbed as much as 0.8 percent after
European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said he can’t be sure
that  Greece  will solve its debt crisis. Gold slumped 1.1 percent
on Feb. 3 after a report showed U.S. non-farm payrolls rose more
than economists had predicted.  Gold futures for April delivery fell 0.9 percent to settle
at $1,724.90 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  Silver futures for March delivery rose less than 0.1

time in four sessions. Platinum futures for April delivery
retreated 0.1 percent to $1,629.80 an ounce. Palladium futures
for March delivery fell 0.4 percent to $705.95 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper futures fell after the  International Monetary Fund 
said Europe’s sovereign-debt woes may sap economic growth in
China, the world’s largest consumer of industrial metals.  Chinese expansion this year might drop as much as 4
percentage points from the current projection of 8.2 percent if
the European crisis escalates, the IMF said. Greece’s biggest
public- and private-sector union groups called a strike to
protest austerity steps.  Copper futures for March delivery in New York declined 0.9
percent to close at $3.8645 a pound. The price climbed 14
percent in the four weeks ended Feb. 3. On that date, the metal
jumped 3.2 percent, the most in two months, as jobs data in the
U.S. bolstered prospects for the economy.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 0.8 percent to $8,500 a metric ton ($3.86 a pound).
Zinc, aluminum and lead also dropped. Nickel and tin rose.  CRUDE OIL  Oil declined in New York on concern that Greece will fail
to take sufficient steps to avert a default, threatening
Europe’s economy and fuel consumption.  Futures dropped 1 percent as European leaders pressured
Greece to accept terms demanded by international lenders on a
bailout package. Brent oil in London traded at the biggest
premium to the American benchmark grade in 13 weeks as record-
low temperatures in Europe bolstered fuel demand.  Crude oil for March delivery fell 93 cents to settle at
$96.91 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices are down 1.9 percent this
year.  Brent oil for March settlement rose $1.35, or 1.2 percent,
to end the session at $115.93 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Today’s close was the highest since Aug. 2.  The Brent contract settled at a $19.02 premium to West
Texas Intermediate oil, the grade traded in New York, based on
settlement prices. It was the widest closing spread in almost
three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
