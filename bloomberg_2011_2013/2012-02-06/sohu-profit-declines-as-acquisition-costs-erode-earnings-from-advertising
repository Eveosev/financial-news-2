Sohu.com Inc. , owner of  China ’s
third-biggest search-engine, posted an unexpected 39 percent
decline in profit as the company incurred a charge from
acquisitions, eroding higher advertising and games sales.  Fourth-quarter net income was $25 million, or 65 cents a
share, from $41.5 million, or $1.07, a year earlier, the
Beijing-based company said in a statement today. This compared
with the $48.7 million average of seven analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 42 percent to $246 million
from $173.2 million.  Sohu’s results included a $27.5 million impairment charge
on acquisitions, according to the statement. The Chinese company
also forecast revenue this quarter that missed analysts’
estimates by as much as 8.8 percent. First-quarter revenue may
rise to between $219 million and $225 million. This compares
with the $240 million average of eight analysts’ estimates.  Sohu  rose  2.7 percent to $63.05 in New York trading on Feb.
3. The stock has advanced 26 percent this year, outperforming
the 16 percent gain in  Baidu Inc. , China’s biggest Internet
company by market value.  Sohu accounted for 2.7 percent of China’s search-engine
market by revenue last quarter, according to research company
Analysys International.  Baidu Inc.  increased its market share to
78.3 percent, while  Google Inc.  declined to 16.7 percent,
according to Analysys.  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
