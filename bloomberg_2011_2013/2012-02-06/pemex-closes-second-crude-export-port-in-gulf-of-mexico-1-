Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned
oil company, closed a second crude-export terminal in the  Gulf
of Mexico  after bad weather conditions got worse.  The terminal at the port of Coatzacoalcos was shut,
Mexico’s Merchant Marine said today in a weather  bulletin  on its
website. The port of Dos Bocas was closed earlier, while the
Cayo Arcas terminal remained open.  Pemex, the third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S.,
exported about 1.3 million barrels of crude a day in December.
About 84 percent of Mexican crude exports are sold to the U.S.,
according to statistics from Mexico City-based Pemex.  Canada is the largest supplier of crude to the U.S followed
by Saudi Arabia. Dos Bocas is Pemex’s third-largest export
terminal behind Cayo Arcas and Coatzacoalcos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
