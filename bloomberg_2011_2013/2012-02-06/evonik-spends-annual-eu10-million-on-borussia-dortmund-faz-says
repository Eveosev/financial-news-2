Evonik Industries AG extended its
sponsorship of the  Borussia Dortmund (BVB)  soccer team by three years
at a cost of more than 10 million euros ($13 million) annually,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing Evonik Chief
Executive Officer Klaus Engel.  The club, which is receiving more money from Evonik than
from the prior contract, will also get a “success bonus”
should it win the German cup or take part in European
competitions, the Frankfurt-based newspaper said.  Sponsorship of the soccer team is resulting in better
recognition for the Essen-based chemicals maker, even in  Asia ,
Engel said, according to FAZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
