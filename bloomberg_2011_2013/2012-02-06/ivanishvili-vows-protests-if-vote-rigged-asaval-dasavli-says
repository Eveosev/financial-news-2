Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili said he’ll organize demonstrations if President
Mikheil Saakashvili’s government rigs this year’s parliamentary
election, Asaval-Dasavli reported.  “If they go ahead and falsify as much as 20 percent to 30
percent of the votes, we won’t behave like angels, of course,”
the Tbilisi-based newspaper quoted Ivanishvili as saying.
“We’ll stand in the streets and defend our votes. We’ll use
every means allowed by law.”  Ivanishvili, whose wealth was estimated at $5.5 billion by
Forbes magazine in March, began a public movement aimed at
challenging Saakashvili’s hold on power. He is awaiting a
decision by the Justice Ministry on a request to restore his
Georgian citizenship, which was revoked on Oct. 11.  The parliamentary contest is scheduled for October,
followed by a presidential election next year. Ivanishvili said
he seeks a peaceful transfer of power.  Manana Manjgaladze, a spokeswoman for Saakashvili, said she
hadn’t read the article and declined to comment when contacted
by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
