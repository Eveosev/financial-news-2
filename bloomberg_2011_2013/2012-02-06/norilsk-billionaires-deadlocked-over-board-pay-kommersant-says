OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel’s main
shareholders, led by billionaires Oleg Deripaska and  Vladimir Potanin  are deadlocked over how to define and pay independent
board directors, after two meetings last week,  Kommersant 
reported, without citing anyone.  Deripaska’s United Co. Rusal rejected a proposal on how to
define independent directors and Potanin’s Interros rejected a
proposal on how to pay them, the Moscow-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
