A consortium led by Triunfo
Participacoes e Investimentos SA won the license to operate the
Viracopos airport in Campinas after bidding 3.8 billion reais in
an auction today.  The minimum bid for a 30-year lease of the airport near  Sao
Paulo  was 1.5 billion reais. The winners will have a 51 percent
stake in the license while  Brazil ’s state-run airport operator
Infraero will retain a 49 percent stake in the management of the
airport.  Eleven groups were competing in today’s auction, in which
the rights to operate the Sao Paulo’s Guarulhus and the airport
in Brasilia were also leased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
