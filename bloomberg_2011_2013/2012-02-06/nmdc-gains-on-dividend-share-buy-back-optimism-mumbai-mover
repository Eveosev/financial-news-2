NMDC Ltd. (NMDC) , India’s biggest iron ore
producer, rose the most in almost two years on speculation the
company will use its cash reserves of about 190 billion rupees
($3.9 billion) to increase dividend or buy back stock.  The  shares  of the Hyderabad, India-based miner surged as
much as 7.2 percent to 195.80 rupees, the most since March 17,
2010, and traded at 194.40 rupees as of 10:41 a.m. in Mumbai.  “There’s high expectations that NMDC will either give more
dividend or come up with a share buyback plan this year,” said
 Niraj Shah , an analyst at Fortune Equity Brokers Ltd. in Mumbai.
“The company has the cash pile needed to reward shareholders.”  Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  is exploring ways to fund
the government’s spending on roads, hospitals, ports and power
stations after falling short of his target fundraising from
asset sales. India’s gross domestic product expanded 6.9 percent
in the three months ended Sept. 30, the slowest pace in more
than two years.  NMDC Chairman N.K. Nanda could not be reached for a comment
on his mobile phone. Finance Director S. Thiagarajan could not
be reached immediately for a comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
