Indian stocks extended their longest
weekly run in 16 months as the rupee strengthened and U.S. jobs
grew more than estimated.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the aluminum maker that controls
U.S.-based Novelis Inc., climbed 1.7 percent.  State Bank of
India , the biggest lender, advanced for a second day.  Larsen &
Toubro Ltd. , the largest engineering company, rose 2.2 percent.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index , or Sensex, increased 0.6
percent to 17,707.31 as of the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The
rupee had its longest winning run since October 2010 last week
as the strongest manufacturing data in eight months prompted
 foreigners  to buy a net $3.2 billion of local equities this
year, compared with withdrawals of $512 million in 2011.  “The one market we really like is India right now,”  Bill Belchere , regional head of equity research at Mirae Asset
Securities in  Hong Kong , told Bloomberg Television in an
interview today. “It’s coming back, and the second half is
going to be quite a bit better than the first.”  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India added 0.7 percent to 5,361.65, mirroring gains in Asian
stocks. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.4 percent, extending
its longest stretch of weekly advances since 2010, as higher-
than-expected U.S. jobs growth pushed up consumer companies. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  reached a six-month high on Feb. 3
after data showed U.S. employers added 243,000 jobs in January,
the most since April, fueling speculation the world’s biggest
economy is recovering.  ‘Surplus Liquidity’  The Sensex has rallied every week this year as the rupee
jumped from a record low, the central bank pared banks’ reserve
norms for the first time since 2009 and inflation eased. The
index trades at 15.7 times future earnings, compared with 10.4
times on the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  “All asset classes -- emerging markets, developed markets
equities, gold and crude -- have gone up dramatically,” said
Sanjeev Prasad, senior executive director and co-head of Kotak
Institutional Equities, in an interview to Bloomberg UTV today.
“Globally we are seeing surplus liquidity conditions triggered
by developments in the  euro zone . The ECB is following a very
loose monetary policy that has added to the loose policy being
followed by the Fed. People are willing to take risks now.”  Reserve Bank  of India Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said on
Feb. 2 the central bank will reduce borrowing costs once it’s
confident inflation will keep slowing. Policy makers reduced the
amount lenders must set aside as  reserves  for the first time in
three years, joining nations from  Brazil  to  Thailand  that have
begun monetary easing. The RBI next meets on March 15.  Manufacturing Growth  Wholesale prices in December dropped below 8 percent for
the first time in two years, after 13 interest-rate increases
since the start of 2010. India and  China  posted an improvement
in manufacturing numbers, suggesting the fastest-growing major
economies are withstanding the impact of  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Hindalco increased 1.7 percent to 155.3 rupees.  Sterlite
Industries (India) Ltd. , the biggest copper and zinc producer,
rose 2 percent to 125.35 rupees.  State Bank  surged 2.8 percent
to 2,162.65, extending this year’s rally to 34 percent. Larsen &
Toubro advanced 2.2 percent to 1,384.95 rupees.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd ., the unit of Unilever Plc, lost 3.6
percent to 387.05 rupees even as its third-quarter profit
exceeded estimates. Net income was 7.54 billion rupees, beating
the 6.96 billion rupees estimated by 31 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. The stock was the best performer on the Sensex last year
with a 30 percent gain.  Eight out of 17, or 47 percent, of Sensex companies have
posted December-quarter earnings that missed analyst estimates,
compared with 40 percent in the September quarter.  Mid-Cap Discount  The BSE Mid-Cap Index of 256 companies rallied 1.3 percent
to 6,122.57, its highest level since Nov. 11. The gauge has
jumped 19 percent this year, shrinking its discount over the
Sensex to a four-year low. The ratio between the estimated
price-to-earnings multiples for the Sensex and the mid-cap index
narrowed to 1.16 times, the smallest reading since March 2008.
It was 1.42 times at the end of last year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “The interest-cost impact in a rising interest-rate cycle
is more severe on mid-caps and that was one of the reasons for
their underperformance last year,” said Jaya Rao Venkatesan, a
 fund manager  in Chennai for Sundaram Mutual Fund, which manages
about $3 billion in assets. “It’s a matter of time before the
RBI cuts rates. That will augur well for mid-cap companies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
