Collective Brands Inc. (PSS) , the retailer
that said in August it’s reviewing strategic options, will open
its first Payless shoe stores in Vietnam, Thailand and  Korea 
this year.  The company plans to open 16 stores through franchise
agreements in the three countries this year, LuAnn Via, who
heads the Payless division, said in a Feb. 3 telephone
interview.  “We were very interested in Korea; we think that our brand
will resonate very well there,” Via said. “We perform
extremely well” in  developing countries , she said.  Collective Brands said in August that it was studying
alternatives to boost the price of its stock. The company could
be worth as much as $27 a share based on the value of its
separate businesses, Morningstar Inc. has said.  Via declined to comment on the strategic process and how it
could affect expansion.  “We have to be focused on driving the day-to-day
business,” she said.  Payless, with about 4,500 stores in 34 countries, opened
its first franchised unit in 2009 in  Kuwait . It now has 140
franchised locations and expects to increase the number to about
700 by 2014. Topeka, Kansas-based Collective Brands also owns
the Saucony, Stride Rite, Keds and Sperry Top-Sider brands.  Collective Brands fell less than 1 percent to $16.65 on
Feb. 3 in  New York .  The shares  dropped 32 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
