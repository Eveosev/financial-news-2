European  diesel  rose to the highest
level in more than three weeks as BP Plc bought on the barge
market for a fourth day.  Vitol Group sold a gasoil cargo to Litasco, OAO Lukoil’s
trading unit. Front-month gasoil on ICE Futures  Europe  exchange
in London rose to more than the next month, a price structure
known as backwardation, for the first time in three weeks as
colder weather in Europe boosted demand.  Light Products  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent shrank to $4.96 a barrel from
$5.23 on Feb. 3, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.,
a London-based broker. The discount for June was at $6.90, the
data show.  BNP Paribas SA recommended buying the European naphtha
crack for June and July as refinery closures in the region crimp
fuel supplies while demand rises in  Asia .  “We recommend going long summer cracks,”  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity markets strategy at BNP
Paribas, said today in a report. “The positive factors driving
firmer European naphtha prices recently, the prospects for
tighter gasoline balances and higher Asian demand, are here to
stay.”  Total SA had a technical fault on Feb. 3 with a steam
cracker at its Feyzin site in  France , the company said today in
an e-mailed statement. The cracker produces mainly ethylene and
propylene, products used to make plastics.  Gasoline (MOGEEURB)  for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded from $1,006 to $1,016 a metric ton, according to
a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board and Platts pricing window. That compares with $997.50 to
$1,008 on Feb. 3. The prices are for Eurobob grade, to which
ethanol is added to make the finished motor fuel.  The motor fuel’s  crack , or premium to Brent, fell to $6.19
a barrel from $6.48 on Feb. 3, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  BP purchased four diesel barges from Royal Dutch Shell Plc
at premiums of $20 and $22 a ton to February gasoil, according
to the Platts survey. That’s in line with trades on Jan. 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BP bought two  jet fuel  barges from Deutsche Lufthansa AG
and  Air France-KLM  at premiums of $59 a ton to March gasoil,
according to the survey. That compares with Feb. 3 deals at $62
and $63 a ton to the February contract.  The 15,000 ton gasoil cargo was priced at a $13 premium to
February gasoil futures for delivery to the French port of  Le
Havre , the survey showed.  Barges (HEATAAAA)  of the heating oil traded at parity to February
gasoil, the Platts survey showed. That compares with Feb. 3
deals at parity to a discount of $1.50.  Gasoil for February climbed 2.6 percent to $984.50 a ton at
5:02 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. That contract traded
at 75 cents more than March futures, pushing the market into
backwardation for the first time since Jan. 16.  Temperatures in  Frankfurt  are forecast to fall to minus 10
degrees Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) tomorrow from minus 6 Celsius
today, according to data by CustomWeather Inc. on Bloomberg.
 Germany  is Europe largest heating oil market.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability,
widened to $16.84 a barrel from $16.20 at 4:30 p.m. on Feb. 3,
according to ICE data. Front-month Brent gained 0.8 percent to
$115.47 a barrel on the ICE exchange.  Net-long managed-money bets on ICE gasoil futures and
options rose to 65,438 lots last week from 67,888 a week
earlier, according to ICE data.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded at $682.25 to $688 a ton, the
survey of Platts showed. That’s higher than Feb. 3 trades at
$659.50 to $664. The low-sulfur grade changed hands at $704 to
$707 a ton compared with $687 in the previous session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
