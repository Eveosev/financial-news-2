The German state of Schleswig-
Holstein is adding at least 250 million euros to its floating-
rate notes maturing in July 2017, according to a banker involved
in the transaction.  The new notes may be priced to yield about 21 basis points
more than Euribor, the banker said. DZ Bank AG, HSH Nordbank AG,
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  are managing the re-opening.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
