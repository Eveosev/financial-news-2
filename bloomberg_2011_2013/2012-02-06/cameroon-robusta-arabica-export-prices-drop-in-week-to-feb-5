Prices for robusta and arabica coffee
exports from Cameroon declined in the week through Feb. 5,
according to the nation’s Cocoa and Coffee Board.  The average export price for robusta, which is used in
instant coffee and espresso, decreased 3.5 percent, or 30  CFA
francs , to 828 CFA francs a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 858
francs a week earlier, Richard Adzogo, an official at the
Douala-based board’s information department, said in a mobile-
phone text message today.  The price for arabica fell 3.1 percent to 2,255 francs per
kilogram, Adzogo said. Cameroon has shipped 61 metric tons of
arabica since the season began in October, according to the
board’s data. Robusta exports reached 209 tons in the harvest
period that started in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
