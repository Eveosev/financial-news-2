Raizen, a joint venture of  Royal (RDSA) 
Dutch Shell Plc and Cosan Industria & Comercio SA in Brazil,
will process 9 percent more sugar cane in the season starting in
April than a year earlier, commercial director Ivan Melo said.  Raizen’s cane processing in the 2012-13 season will be 57.6
million metric tons, with sugar output up about 15 percent to
4.3 million tons and ethanol supply about 10 percent higher at
2.4 billion liters (634 million gallons), Melo said in an
interview at the Kingsman conference in Dubai today. Sweetener
content will also rise, he said.  “We have an accelerated replanting program and we have two
mills, one in Mato Grosso do Sul and one in Goias, where
production will be rising this year because they are new
units,” he said. It takes five to six years for a new mill to
reach capacity, he said. Melo is based in  Sao Paulo .  The cane crop in Brazil’s center-south, the main growing
region of the world’s biggest producer, will be 536 million
tons in the period, Melo said in a speech at the conference
yesterday. That compares with an output of 492.7 million tons so
far this season, data from Brazilian industry group Unica show.
Sugar output in the area will be 33 million to 34.5 million
tons, he said.  Sugar cane output in the center-south fell for the first
time in a decade in the 2011-12 season after frost, flowering
and dry weather damaged the crop, Unica said. Flowering and
frost reduced productivity by 4 percent last year, Melo said.  “Everybody is accelerating planting so if we have normal
weather conditions, without frost and flowering, it is normal
that production will rise,” he said.  Ethanol Switch  Producers in  Brazil  will direct 47 percent of the cane to
sugar production this year, down from 48 percent in the 2011-12
season because of lower prices, he said. Both sugar and ethanol
are made from raw material cane in the South American country.  Sugar reached a 30-year high of 36.08 cents a pound in
February 2011, and ended the year down 27 percent on
speculation supplies will outpace demand. The global surplus
will be 6.5 million to 8 million tons in 2011-12, Melo said.  “Lower sugar prices will give an incentive for the
Brazilian producer to want to explore the domestic and export
ethanol market,” he said. “Below 22 cents a pound the producer
will start looking for other alternatives other than sugar.”  Raw sugar for March delivery was up 1.2 percent at 24.22
cents a pound at 10:30 a.m. London time on the ICE Futures U.S.
exchange in  New York .  Brazilian ports should not experience bottlenecks this year
because the sugar market is moving into a so-called contango and
therefore there won’t be a rush to obtain the product, he said.
A contango structure is when sugar for delivery in later dates
becomes more expensive than the sweetener for immediate
delivery, signaling ample supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
