Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s

structured products and exotic financial instruments operations.  The lender is reviewing options for the businesses,
including closure, Macquarie said in an e-mailed statement
today. The advisory, equity trading, research and fund
management units aren’t affected by the talks, the bank said.  Karen Smith, a spokeswoman for the bank in  London , declined
