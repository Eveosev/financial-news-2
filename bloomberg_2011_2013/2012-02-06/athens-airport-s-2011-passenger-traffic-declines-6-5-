Passenger traffic at Athens
International Airport dropped 6.5 percent last year as the
economic crisis squeezed travel spending, especially by Greeks.  The number of people passing through the country’s biggest
airport fell to 14.4 million, from 15.4 million in 2010,
according to a statement posted on the airport’s  website today .  Domestic passenger traffic declined 12 percent to 4.9
million and international traffic dropped 3.1 percent to 9.5
million, the company said. Domestic and international passengers
declined 11 percent in December to 304,600 and 562,350,
respectively.  Tourism,  Greece ’s biggest industry, accounted for almost 16
percent of gross domestic product and almost one in five jobs in
2011, according to London-based  World Travel and Tourism
Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
