Pakistan  defeated England by 71 runs
in Dubai to sweep their three-match Test cricket series.  Umar Gul was 4-61 and Saeed Ajmal was 4-67 to lead Pakistan
to victory on the fourth day, as England could only reach 252
runs all out in its second innings. England started the day 36-0
with captain Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook batting, and
needed 324 to win.  Pakistan took the first Test, also held in Dubai, by 10
wickets, and then won in Abu Dhabi by 72 runs. The teams now

games.  In the current Test, Pakistan was all out for 99 in its
first innings, and England took a lead by reaching 141 in
response. The victors reached 365 in their second innings, and
Englandâ€™s batsmen continued to struggle against Pakistan.  No Englishman scored 50 runs, with Matt Prior not out on 49
at the end. Alastair Cook was caught on 49 and Eoin Morgan was
the next highest scorer on 31.  Jonathan Trott ,  Kevin Pietersen ,
and  Stuart Broad  were all dismissed on 18.  Abdur Rehman took the other two wickets for Pakistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
