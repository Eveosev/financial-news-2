Australian job notices surged in
January by the most in 23 months as hiring increased in the
nation’s mineral-rich states, a private report showed.  Jobs advertised  in newspapers and on the Internet jumped 6
percent last month, after a revised 0.6 percent drop in
December, the biggest increase since February 2010, according to
an  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd . report released in
Melbourne today.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia cut  interest rates  in
November and December in the first back-to-back reductions in
two years, lowering the benchmark to 4.25 percent to boost
demand as inflation pressure eased. Resource projects in
Australia valued at A$456 billion ($490 billion), fueled by
companies such as  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , are helping cushion a slump
in manufacturing and services hurt by a strong currency.  Today’s result “is being driven by acceleration in the
mining regions of Australia, in Queensland and the Northern
Territory in particular in recent months, confirming the awaited
significant acceleration in mining investment is now beginning
to boost labor demand in these states,” Ivan Colhoun, head of
Australian economics and property research at ANZ Bank, said in
a statement.  National vacancies advertised in newspapers fell 2.6
percent in January, and Internet notices surged 6.4 percent,
today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
