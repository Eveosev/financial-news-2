Madhvani Group, owner of  Uganda ’s
biggest sugar plant, was cleared to acquire land for a second
factory in the northern district of Amuru after it won a court
ruling against an effort to block the project,  New Vision 
reported, citing a high court judge.  The district land board was correct in allocating land to
the company, Wilson Musalu Musene ruled on Feb. 3 in the
northern district of Gulu, according to the Kampala-based
newspaper. Three former legislators in the region applied to the
court in 2008 to challenge the acquisition of communal land by
Madhvani, which owns Kakira Sugar Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
