Latvia should double the country’s
non-taxable minimum income to give more money to poorer people
next year, Finance Minister Andris Vilks said in an interview
with Dienas Bizness.  The measure would give an additional 500 lati ($934.23)
annually to people with low income, Vilks said according to the
report. Raising the threshold from 45 lati to 90 lati “would be
the most important for me for 2013,” he said to the Riga-based
newspaper.  The budget deficit may fall to around 1.8 percent of gross
domestic product this year from about a 4.2 percent deficit last
year, Vilks said, according to Dienas Bizness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
