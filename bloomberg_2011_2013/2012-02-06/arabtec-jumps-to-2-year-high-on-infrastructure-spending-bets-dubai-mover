Arabtec Holding PJSC , the  United Arab
Emirates ’ biggest construction company, climbed to a two-year
high amid speculation the company will benefit from regional
infrastructure spending.  The shares rallied 9.2 percent to 2.60 dirhams at the 2
p.m. close in Dubai, the highest level since November 2009.
Arabtec advanced for a sixth day,  the longest stretch of gains 
since April 2008. The stock has soared 64 percent  so far this
year  and was the  most traded  in Dubai’s  DFM General Index  today.
The benchmark  stock index  gained 0.6 percent to 1,476.24, the
highest since Sept. 8.  “There is nothing that justifies such a sharp move in the
share price, other than speculation about potential increases to
the backlog which may not come until at least the second half of
2012,” said London-based Oliver Bell, who helps manage $2.9
billion in Middle East and Africa equities at T. Rowe Price
International Inc.  Arabtec shares have surged 88 percent in the past year,
compared with a 13 percent drop for  Emaar Properties PJSC ,
developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper in Dubai. Arabtec
volume today was the highest since March. Calls to Arabtec Chief
Financial Officer  Ziad Makhzoumi  by Bloomberg News today weren’t
answered.  Arabtec said in November the value of a contract it won in
 Saudi Arabia  may rise to 1.5 billion riyals ($400 million) as it
expands in the biggest Arab market. The company last month won a
25-month contract valued at 561 million dirhams ($153 million)
to expand Dubai International Airport. One of its units got 256
million dirhams of contracts in  Abu Dhabi  last week.  The company  may report  a 60 percent drop in fourth-quarter
profit to 22 million dirhams, according to the median estimate
of three analysts on Bloomberg. Arabtec’s  third-quarter profit 
rose to 39.1 million dirhams from 6.8 million dirhams a year
earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
