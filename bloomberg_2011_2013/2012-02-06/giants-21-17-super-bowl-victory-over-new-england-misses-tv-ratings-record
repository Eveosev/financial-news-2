The New York Giants’ 21-17 win over
the  New England Patriots  in last night’s  Super Bowl  was seen by
an average of 111.3 million people, the biggest audience in U.S.
television history, according  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC network.  The viewership total for the game at Lucas Oil Stadium in
Indianapolis narrowly topped last year’s record of 111 million
for the Green Bay Packers’ Super Bowl win over the Pittsburgh
Steelers, NBC said in a news release.  The game was seen in an average of 47 percent of U.S.
homes, the best rating since 1986 when the Chicago Bears’ win
over the Patriots drew a 48.3 rating. Yesterday’s 47 rating is
the sixth highest in Super Bowl history.  This was the seventh straight year of Super Bowl-record
viewership. It peaked at 117.7 million during its final half-
hour, as the Giants’ Eli Manning directed a late-game touchdown
drive that gave New York the lead, and a desperation game-ending
throw to the end zone by  New England ’s  Tom Brady  fell
incomplete. It was the Giants’ fourth Super Bowl title and
second in five years.  An average of 114 million viewers watched the halftime show
that featured Madonna, the most for a championship halftime show
that featured entertainment, which dates back to 1991. More than
four million fewer people watched the Black Eyed Peas at
halftime a year ago.  The Giants’ Super Bowl victory in many ways mirrored their
upset 17-14 win over New England in the 2008 title game, as
Manning led late-game touchdown drives in both contests.
Yesterday’s game had a 14 percent higher rating.  The average 30-second commercial during last night’s game
sold for $3.5 million, according to NBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
