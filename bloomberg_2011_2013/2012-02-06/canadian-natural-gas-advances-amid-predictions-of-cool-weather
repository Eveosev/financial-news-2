Canadian natural gas rose, reversing
earlier declines, amid forecasts of colder-than-normal weather
in the U.S. Midwest.  Alberta  gas rose 1.5 percent. Temperatures in Minneapolis
Feb. 10 will dip to minus 2 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 19
Celsius), 13 below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. Demand
for heat in the Midwest city will exceed normal by 31 percent
that day, said Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives.  “The near-term weather has improved” for gas prices, said
Carl Neill, an energy consultant with Risk Management Inc. in
Atlanta.  Alberta gas for March delivery rose 3.25 cents to C$2.16 a
gigajoule ($2.06 per million British thermal units) at 2:45 p.m.
New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas has
lost 26 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 5.1 cents, or 2 percent, to settle at $2.55 per
million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
8.35 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $2.6877 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can carry
1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas advanced 9.06 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.5319.
At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas rose 9.62 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $2.6546.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.9 billion cubic
feet, 103 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.36 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.21 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 538 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.9 billion cubic feet today, or 78 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.99
billion cubic feet at 1:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
