Chile’s economy grew a faster-than-
expected 5.3 percent in December from the previous year on gains
in the retail, communications and mining industries, the central
bank said.  The economy expanded 1.3 percent from the previous month on
a seasonally adjusted basis, the bank said in a statement posted
on its website today. The median estimate of 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for annual growth of 3.9 percent in
December.  December’s figure brings annual growth in the fourth
quarter to 4.2 percent, down from 4.8 percent in the previous
three months, according to calculations made by Bloomberg based
on central bank data. Growth in the world’s largest copper
producer will slow this year on weak export expansion, while
retail sales growth remains robust, central bank President
Rodrigo Vergara said last week.  “Our economy is moving gradually toward less expansive
rates even as spending data still show major growth,” he said
Jan. 31. “Clearly there are differences between sectors. In
some industrial areas, especially those dedicated to exports,
it’s noticeable there’s less vigor.”  Copper for three-month delivery declined 0.7 percent to
$8,502 a metric ton at 11:52 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices increased 13 percent in the four weeks through last week.
Copper averaged $8,826 a metric ton last year and $7,557.94 a
ton in 2010.  Chile’s peso fell 0.3 percent to 480.50 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:34 a.m. Santiago time, according to prices compiled by
Datatec.  Growth Outlook  Industrial production grew 5.4 percent last year, about
half as fast as retail sales, according to the National
Statistics Institute. Retail revenue growth will decelerate to
about 5 percent to 6 percent in 2012, the Chilean Chamber of
Commerce, known as CNC, said in a Jan. 26 report.  Chile’s economy, which is forecast to expand as much as
4.75 percent this year, may slow more than estimated if the
European sovereign-debt crisis deteriorates, Vergara said on
Jan. 31.  “Major risks persist,” he said during a Senate session on
the global economic slowdown. “Among these risks are the
possibility that new episodes of international financial
volatility end up affecting the expectations of players, global
demand and international credit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
