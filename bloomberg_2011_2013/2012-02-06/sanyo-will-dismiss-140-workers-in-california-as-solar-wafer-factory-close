Sanyo Electric Co . will cut about 140
jobs and close an aging solar wafer factory in Carson,
 California , as it prepares to start up operations at a plant in
 Malaysia .  The plant, which makes the equivalent of 30 megawatts of
silicon ingots and wafers for solar cells a year, will stop
production next month and close in October, Masatsugu Uemura, a
spokesman for Panasonic Energy Co., said by phone from  Osaka .
Sanyo is a unit of  Panasonic Corp. (6752)   Equipment at the plant, opened in 2003, was getting old and
the company found it difficult to expand the business there
because of the small size of the site, Uemura said. “Price
competition is also getting tough,” he said.  Prices for solar panels and their raw materials fell last
year as Chinese manufacturers increased production, leading to
excess capacity after European governments cut back on
subsidies. Sumco Corp., a Japanese silicon wafer maker, said on
Feb. 2 it will cut about 1,300 jobs, or 15 percent of its
workforce, as it withdraws from its solar manufacturing business
due to declining prices.  Sanyo has a 70-megawatt plant in Salem,  Oregon , that also
makes ingots and wafers. Panasonic said in November it will
invest 45 billion yen ($587 million) to build a 300-megawatt
plant for wafers, solar cells and modules in the Kulim Hi-Tech
Park in Kedah, northern Malaysia. Production will start in
December, Panasonic said.  Uemura confirmed a Forbes.com  report  on Feb. 3 that Sanyo’s
planned job cuts equal about 40 percent of its total workforce
in the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
