Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d. won’t be
able to repay its debt if it doesn’t sell its holding in store
chain  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d., STA newswire reported,
citing Dusan Zorko, chief executive officer of the Slovenian
drinks company.  If the company manages to sell its 23 percent stake in
Mercator, its debt would be reduced by as much as 195 million
euros ($255 million), Zorko said, according to the Slovenian
newswire.  The sale of Mercator to its Croatian rival Agrokor d.d.
will depend on the outcome of the shareholders meeting of Nova
Ljubljanska Banka d.d. set for March, STA said.  NLB, as the biggest Slovenian bank is known, delayed its
decision to sell Mercator to Agrokor after increased opposition
to the deal by Slovenian officials. Agrokor, which offered 221
euros for a majority of the Slovenian retailer, said its offer
expires by the end of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
