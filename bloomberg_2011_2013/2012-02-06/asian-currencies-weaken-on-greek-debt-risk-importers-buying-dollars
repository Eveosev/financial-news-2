Asian currencies snapped a four-day
advance on concern recent gains underestimated the risks to
global growth from  Europe ’s still unresolved debt crisis.  The  Thai baht , India’s rupee and the South Korean won led
losses on speculation importers are buying the greenback to take
advantage of favorable exchange rates. Greek Prime Minister
 Lucas Papademos  secured a general agreement on budget-cutting
measures demanded by creditors even as opposition leaders may
object to some of the points needed for the 130 billion-euro
($170 billion) bailout package. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia
Dollar  Index  rallied 1 percent in the last four days, reaching a
four-month high on Feb. 3.  “Investors are unsure whether the recent rally reflects
the risk of the European debt crisis that’s still not fully
resolved,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange
trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank.  The baht fell 0.3 percent to 30.93 per dollar as of 3:25
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rupee declined 0.3 percent to 48.83 and the won dropped 0.2
percent to 1,120.78, respectively. Tha Taiwan dollar lost 0.3
percent to NT$29.60.  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-
traded currencies excluding the yen, retreated 0.4 percent,
paring its rise this year to 2 percent. Emerging-market equity
funds have attracted $11.3 billion of inflows this year through
Feb. 1, their best start since 2006, according to research firm
EPFR Global.  Indonesia GDP  The won snapped a two-day advance even after U.S.
employment data last week, showing the jobless rate at a three-
year low, buoyed the country’s export outlook.  “The ongoing talks over Greek debt and importers buying
the dollar to settle bills may limit gains in the won,” said
Han Sung Min, a foreign-exchange dealer at Busan Bank in  Seoul .  Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.1 percent, a second day of
loss, to 8,993, as government data showed economic growth
declined to a two-year low. Southeast Asia’s largest economy
expanded 6.49 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier
versus 6.54 percent in the preceding three months.  “There are issues of economic growth slowing down,” said
Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at Malayan
Banking Bhd. in Singapore. “It has been showing in Indonesian
export numbers and the currency.”  China ’s yuan dropped 0.15 percent to 6.3121 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to China Foreign-Exchange Trade system. The
central bank set its  reference rate  at 6.3108, weaker for a
second day.  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso strengthened 0.2 percent to
42.545 per dollar and Vietnam’s dong was little changed at
