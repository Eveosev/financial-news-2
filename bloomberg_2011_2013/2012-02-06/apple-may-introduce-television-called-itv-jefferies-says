Apple Inc. (AAPL)  may announce a television
product called the iTV as video content becomes the iPhone
maker’s next major focus, according to a Jefferies & Co.
analyst.  User-generated video from customers who use iPads and
iPhones as recorders may also play a role, giving Apple “the
ability to leverage content into a YouTube-like model,” the
analyst,  Peter Misek , wrote in a note today. Misek, who in the
note gave no time frame for the product announcement, recommends
buying Apple shares.  The Cupertino, California-based company may buy access to
exclusive and non-exclusive programs, possibly through a
partnership with carriers such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon
Communications Inc., Misek said. “Lower margins and higher
risks” are likely to drive away Apple from creating its own
content, the analyst wrote.  Apple co-founder  Steve Jobs , who died Oct. 5, had said in
an interview that he “finally cracked” how to build a TV with
a simple user interface that would wirelessly synchronize
content with Apple’s other devices, biographer Walter Isaacson
wrote last year in “Steve Jobs” ( Simon & Schuster ).  The company’s television-related product efforts have been
limited to a $99 device called Apple TV that connects to a set
and provides access to content from Netflix Inc.’s streaming
service, iTunes and YouTube.  Apple rose 0.9 percent to $463.97 at the close in New York.
The  shares  have gained 34 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
