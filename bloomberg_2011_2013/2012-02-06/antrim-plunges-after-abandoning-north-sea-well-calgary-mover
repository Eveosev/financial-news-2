Antrim Energy Inc. (AEN) , which explores
for oil and natural gas in the North Sea and  Argentina , plunged
after abandoning a North Sea exploration well.  The  shares  fell 22 percent to $1.07 at the close in Toronto,
the biggest decline since Aug. 11, 2006.  Antrim will abandon its East Fyne well in the North Sea
after determining that the thickness of the oil-bearing sand was
“at the lower end” of its estimates, the Calgary-based company
said in a statement today.  Antrim has operations in the U.K.’s North Sea, Argentina
and Tanzania. The company has about 320 million barrels of
proved and probable reserves, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
