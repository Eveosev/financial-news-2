Investments of about 210 billion
euros ($274 billion) in gas and power grid upgrades are required
if the European Union wants to become a single energy market by
2014, EC energy chief  Guenther Oettinger  said.  Europe  needs to invest in new electricity and gas grids in
the next 10 to 15 years to give all EU member-states access to a
pan-European market, the European Commission’s Oettinger said
today in Essen.  “There are still several member-states that are dependent
on one single supplier, on one single pipeline, when it comes to
gas,” Oettinger said in a speech. “You need new lines if you
want to complete the single market, create solidarity in times
of demand, strengthen the consumer and develop renewable energy
sources optimally.”  Germany , Europe’s biggest energy market, lacks a coherent
strategy to expand its power network and countries including
some Baltic states and Bulgaria are too dependent on Russia’s
state-controlled energy giant OAO Gazprom, Oettinger said.  Europe wants to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, increase
the share of renewables and raise  energy efficiency  through 2020
in a bid to promote climate protection. Its 20 percent higher
efficiency target has suffered setbacks as leaders struggle to
generate growth amid debt issues and competition from such
markets as  China .  Germany, the continent’s largest economy, needs to come up
with a “constructive” position toward EU proposals to reduce
energy consumption, Oettinger said. He also urged greater
financial backing from lawmakers to modernize buildings and
support for projects to capture CO2 emissions and store them
underground.  To contact the reporter on this story:
