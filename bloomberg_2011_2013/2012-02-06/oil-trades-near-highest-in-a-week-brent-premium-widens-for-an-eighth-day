Oil traded near the highest price in
almost a week as investors speculated that a U.S. economic
recovery will boost fuel demand. Brent’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate crude widened an eighth day after militants
attacked a pipeline in Nigeria.  Futures were little changed after rising on Feb. 3 for the
first day in six as U.S. Commerce Department data showed
employment climbed more than forecast in January and
unemployment unexpectedly fell. The Movement for the
Emancipation of the  Niger Delta , the main armed group in
Nigeria’s oil-rich southern region, attacked and damaged a
pipeline belonging to a unit of  Italy ’s Eni SpA.  Crude for March delivery was at $97.62 a barrel, down 22
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 8:49 a.m. Singapore time. The contract rose $1.48 to $97.84
on Feb. 3, the highest close since Jan. 31.  Brent oil for March settlement gained 28 cents to $114.86 a
barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract traded
at $17.24 more than WTI, the widest gap based on closing prices
since Nov. 8. The difference was a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Eni lost about 4,000 barrels a day of equity production
from the attack on its pipeline, the Rome-based company said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday. Attacks by militant groups in
the delta cut  Nigeria ’s crude output by more than 28 percent
from 2006 to 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
