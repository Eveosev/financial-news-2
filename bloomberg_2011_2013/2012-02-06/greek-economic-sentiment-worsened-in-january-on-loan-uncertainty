Greek economic sentiment worsened in
January as uncertainty shrouded the country’s efforts to secure
a 130 billion-euro ($170 billion) new financing package from the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  An index measuring short-term economic trends dropped to
74.9 from 75.7 in December, the Athens-based Foundation for
Economic & Industrial Research, known as IOBE, said in an e-
mailed report today.  Consumer confidence  improved to minus 80.1
from minus 81.9 in December, the foundation said.  In October, the economic sentiment index sank to its lowest
level in more than two years as it became clear that an initial
second financing package agreed on in July would need to be
renegotiated. Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos , a former vice
president of the  European Central Bank , became  Greece ’s prime
minister in November in an interim administration charged with
implementing a redesigned package, which was agreed to at an
Oct. 26 EU summit.  “Uncertainty about the overall economic direction of the
country and its financing with the new loan package, together
with its conditions, remains intense,” IOBE said in the report.
“That doesn’t allow an optimistic view, although there are
isolated businesses that are resisting and are trying, under
tight credit conditions, to maintain their momentum.”  Sentiment in the service sector extended its record low,
dropping to 54.2 from 55.2. There were slight improvements in
sentiment in the industrial and retail sectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
