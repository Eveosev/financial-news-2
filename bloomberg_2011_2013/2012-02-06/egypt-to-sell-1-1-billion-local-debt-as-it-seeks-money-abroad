Egypt  plans to raise 6.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($1.1 billion) from the sale of treasury bills
and bonds today after the Finance Minster said it plans to offer
debt to nationals living abroad.  The North African country will seek bids for 3.5 billion
pounds of nine-month treasury bills, according to central bank
data on Bloomberg. The average yield on  nine-month securities  at
a sale last week was at a record 15.822 percent. It will also
offer five- and seven-year bonds valued at 2 billion pounds and
1 billion pounds, respectively, the data show.  Egypt plans to raise at least $2 billion from the sale of
Islamic bonds and certificates of deposits to Egyptians living
abroad as the country seeks to reduce record borrowing costs,
Finance Minister Momtaz El-Saieed said today. The offerings are
planned to take place within two weeks, he said.  The country raised 45.1 billion pounds from the sale of
treasury bills and bonds in January, or 31 percent less than
targeted, as investors demanded higher yields, forcing the
government to curb its debt issuance. The nation has increased
its reliance on local banks to finance its widening budget
deficit as the unrest that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  a
year ago deterred foreign investors.  The yield on Egyptâ€™s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020
declined three basis points, or 0.03 of a percentage point, to
6.95 percent at 11:38 a.m. in Cairo, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The pound was little changed at 6.0309 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
