Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
LLP  hired two partners in  Germany  from  Shearman & Sterling LLP 
as the law firm expands its international capital-markets
practice.  Stephan Hutter, the head of New York-based Shearman’s
European capital-markets practice, and Katja Kaulamo, a partner
specializing in corporate and capital-markets law, will both
move to Skadden’s Frankfurt branch, where they will be partners,
Skadden said today in a statement.  “Their arrival will enhance our German law and German
language offerings for corporate, private equity and investment
banking clients in Germany, Austria and  Switzerland , as well as
increase the breadth of our broader European cross-border
corporate transactions practice,” Bruce M. Buck, the head of
New York-based Skadden’s European practice, said in the
statement.  Skadden, which has more than 1,800 lawyers, was  ranked  the
second-highest-grossing  law firm  in 2010, with more than
$2.1 billion in revenue, by the American Lawyer, a trade
publication.  Ron Brandsdorfer, a Shearman spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment on the departures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
