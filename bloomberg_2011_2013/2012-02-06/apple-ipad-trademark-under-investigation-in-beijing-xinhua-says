Beijing city officials started
investigating  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s rights to use the iPad trademark
there after a complaint by a unit of Hong Kong-listed  Proview
International Holdings Ltd. (334) , Xinhua News Agency reported today.  Proview Technology Shenzhen complained in early 2011 to the
Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce, saying Apple
had infringed its rights to the iPad trademark, Xinhua said,
citing unidentified people at the municipal department.  Apple lost a case in Shenzhen claiming rights to the
trademark in China, Guangzhou Daily reported Dec. 6. Apple has
appealed to the Higher People’s Court of  Guangdong province ,
