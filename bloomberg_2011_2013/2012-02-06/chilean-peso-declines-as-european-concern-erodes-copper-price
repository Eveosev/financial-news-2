Chile’s peso weakened for the first
time in four days as investors shunned riskier, emerging-market
assets including copper, the country’s biggest export.  The peso slid 0.3 percent to 480.05 per  U.S. dollar  from
478.86 on Feb. 3, retreating from a sixth straight weekly gain.  Copper for March delivery weakened as much as 1.9 percent
on concern the European debt crisis may weaken economic growth
in  China , the biggest buyer of the metal. European stocks and
the euro declined as Greek politicians fought to reach a deal on
spending cuts and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  warned them
time was running out. The peso gained briefly after data showed
Chilean economic growth exceeded estimates in December.  “This is external news because the local news points the
other way,’ said Matias  Madrid , chief economist at Banco Penta
in Santiago. “It’s copper and the uncertainty because  Greece 
hasn’t reached a deal yet. The activity data implies the central
bank will hold rates, which should support the peso.”  Madrid doesn’t expect much reaction from the interest-rate
 swaps market  to the activity data given that the likelihood of a
central bank pause was already priced in, he said.  Offshore investors in the forwards market increased bets
against the peso by $700 million to $4.9 billion on Feb. 2 from
$4.2 billion on Feb. 1, according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
