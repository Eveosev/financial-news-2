Japanese  stock   futures  and Australian
equities were little changed as Greek politicians struggled to
meet the conditions of a bailout, reviving concern the debt-
stricken nation may default.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. , a Japanese
camera maker that gets 31 percent of its sales in Europe, fell
0.4 percent from the closing share price in  Tokyo . Those of
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s biggest lender,
slid 0.6 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd.  lost 0.5 percent after a
union leader said workers at a  copper mine  in Chile run by the
world’s No. 1 mining company are preparing a lawsuit over a
bonus dispute.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 8,910 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 8,900
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,890 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was
little changed today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.1
percent in Wellington.  “The market is nervous about the outcome of negotiations
over Greece’s debt haircut,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a
strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo. “They are
also expected to discuss if Greece will be able to rebuild its
finances.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent
today. The index was little changed in New York yesterday as
European leaders stepped up pressure on Greek politicians to
meet the conditions of a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion)
bailout, saying time was running out.  Greek Stalemate  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  met German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  as Greek interim Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
planned to confer with the so-called troika of international
lenders. A gathering of Greece’s political leaders was delayed
by a day until today as they struggled for a unified response.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 9.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 6.9 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and an 8.1 percent increase by the Stoxx  Europe  600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.8 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  Of 303 companies listed on the Asian benchmark index that
have reported earnings since Jan. 9, 172 missed analysts’
estimates while 74 beat expectations, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Sohu.com Inc. tumbled the most in two years, and an index
of Chinese U.S.-traded stocks dropped from a five-month high, as
the owner of China’s third-biggest search engine posted an
unexpected drop in profit. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of
the most-traded Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 2.1 percent
to 104.26 yesterday in  New York , the biggest daily decline since
Dec. 12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
