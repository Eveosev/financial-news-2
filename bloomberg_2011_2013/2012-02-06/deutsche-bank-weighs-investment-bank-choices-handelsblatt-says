Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s incoming co-chief
executive officers,  Anshu Jain  and Juergen Fitschen, plan to
decide in March on two managers to head the investment banking
unit,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing unidentified people in the
banking industry.  The top candidate to lead the securities-trading business
is Colin Fan, who now heads trading in corporate bonds for
emerging markets, the newspaper said, adding that Michele
Faissola, the head of trading in sovereign bonds and raw
materials, is also a possibility for the position.  Stephan Leithner, who is currently head of investment
banking in Germany, may get responsibility for corporate
finance, advising on mergers and acquisitions, securities
placements and transaction banking, Handelsblatt said. Another
candidate for that job is  Robert Rankin , who heads Deutsche
Bank’s operations in Asia, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
