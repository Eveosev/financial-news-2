Siemens AG (SIE)  is working with GDF Suez,
Vinci SA and CDC Infrastructure to compete for a 10-billion euro
($13 billion) contract in  France  to provide offshore wind power
at Saint-Brieuc in the northwest,  Les Echos  cited the head of
Siemens France as saying.  Siemens would build a plant in France to assemble the wind
turbines if its group is selected over two others competing, the
executive, said Christophe de Maistre, according to the paper.
Siemens would also help its French partners expand
internationally if their group is selected, it reported.  Siemens is also competing for a contract to modernize the
metro systems in Lille, which Siemens put in place in 1983, a
competition that will pit Siemens against Alstom SA and
Bombardier Inc., de Maistre was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
