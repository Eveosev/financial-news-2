Citigroup Inc. Chief Economist Willem Buiter said the possibility that  Greece  will leave the euro area
in the next 18 months has increased to 50 percent from 25
percent to 30 percent.  The willingness of creditors to support Greece has “fallen
substantially,” economists Buiter, a former Bank of England
policy maker, and Ebrahim Rahbari, said in a research note
today. They projected the costs of a Greek exit to the rest of
the euro area as “moderate” because contagion would be
“contained by policy action, if needed.”  “We think that the Greek government will achieve an
orderly but most likely coercive debt restructuring,” Buiter
and Rahbari said.  European leaders stepped up pressure today on Greek
politicians to meet the conditions of a 130 billion-euro ($171
billion) bailout, saying time was running out.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  met German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  in Paris as Greece’s interim prime minister,  Lucas Papademos , prepared to negotiate with the so-called troika of
international lenders in Athens for a second day. A gathering of
Greek political leaders was delayed until tomorrow as they
struggled for a unified response.  To contact the reporter on this story:
