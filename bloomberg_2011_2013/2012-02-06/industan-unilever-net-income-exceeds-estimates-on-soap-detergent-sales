Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , a unit of
the world’s second-biggest consumer-goods maker, reported third-
quarter sales growth for personal care products that
disappointed some analysts amid a slowdown in  India’s economy .  Net income  rose 18 percent to 7.54 billion rupees ($154.4
million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, from 6.38 billion
rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said in a filing
today. That compares with the 6.96 billion-rupee median of 31
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales growth in the company’s personal-care segment, whose
brands include Fair & Lovely face cream and Vaseline,
disappointed some analysts.  Asia ’s third-biggest economy will
expand 7 percent in the year ending March, the least in seven
years, according to the median prediction of 15 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  “There could be some disappointment in the personal care
growth, which has not been up to expectations,” said Naveen
Kulkarni, an analyst with MF Global Sify Securities Pvt.  Hindustan Unilever, the maker of Dove shampoo and Surf
detergent, closed down 3.6 percent to 387.05 rupees as of 3 p.m.
in Mumbai trading. The stock earlier rose as much as 2.4
percent.  Sales of soaps and detergents grew 21 percent, while
personal-care product sales increased by 14 percent, the company
said in the statement.  Sales for the maker of Knorr soups and Lux soaps grew to
58.5 billion rupees from 50.3 billion rupees a year earlier.
That compares with the 58.75 billion-rupee median of 32
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
