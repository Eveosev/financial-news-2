Qatar Railways Development Co. plans
to auction four packages valued at $2 billion to $3 billion each
for metro tunneling works in early April, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Geoff Mee said.  The contracts will be awarded in October, Mee said at the
MEED Projects Qatar conference. The company also plans to
auction contracts in April to build two major metro stations,
for about $1 billion each, he said. Qatar Rail today issued its
first request for “enabling works” and expects companies to
submit proposals in one month.  Qatar, the world’s wealthiest country per capita, is using
revenue from natural gas exports to build roads, a new airport
and other infrastructure before hosting the soccer  World Cup  in
2022. The country plans to use its rail and metro network to
transport fans to stadiums for the event.  Qatar Rail moved up the completion date for the first phase
of its metro network by 18 months to ensure the network would be
available for the 2020  Olympic Games , which Qatar is bidding to
host, Mee said.  The metro and rail system, which would include a connection
to Bahrain, will cost $35 billion to $40 billion to build, Mee
said. The first phase of the project will connect the airport in
the south to a racetrack on the northern outskirts of the
capital Doha, he added. The second phase will extend the network
to cities in the north and south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
