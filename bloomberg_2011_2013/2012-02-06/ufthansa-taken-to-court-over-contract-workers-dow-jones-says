Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  is being taken
to court by its cabin staff over plans to employee agency
contract workers for flights operating out of Berlinâ€™s new
airport, Dow Jones  reported , citing Alexander Behrens, the
chairman of the staff committee.  The employees submitted an injunction to the labor court in
 Frankfurt  after Lufthansa missed a deadline to agree out of
court, Behrens said, according to Dow Jones. The court hearing
will take place on Feb. 15, Dow Jones said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
