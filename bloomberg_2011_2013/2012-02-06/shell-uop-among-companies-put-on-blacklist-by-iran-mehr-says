Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi
has ordered five European companies, including Royal Dutch Shell
Plc, to be put on a blacklist for failing to meet their
commitments in the nation’s refinery projects,  Mehr  reported.  Shell and UOP LLC, a unit of U.S.-based Honeywell
International Inc., were among the companies named in the report
published today by the state-run  news agency .  Qasemi “ordered the National Iranian Oil Products Refining
and Distribution Co. to halt foreign purchases of license in the
country’s refinery projects at a time of increasing sanctions
and lack of commitment of foreign companies,” according to the
news agency.  ‘These companies will have no role in the future in  Iran ’s
oil and gas industries,” Mehr said, citing the refiner.  Iran is in conflict with western countries over accusations
that it is using its nuclear program as a cover for developing
weapons, a charge the government denies. European Union foreign
ministers agreed on Jan. 23 to ban Iranian crude oil imports
starting in July and freeze the assets of the country’s central
bank, measures that come in addition to previous  United Nations ,
U.S. and EU sanctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
