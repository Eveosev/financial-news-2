Bragg Communications Inc., a provider
of television and telephone services serving  Nova Scotia ,
Canada, is seeking $1.76 billion in loans.  TD Securities Inc., the investment-banking arm of Toronto
Dominion Bank, is leading the transaction and will meet with
lenders in Toronto today and in New York tomorrow, according to
a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be
identified because the terms are private.  The transaction includes a $150.8 million revolving line of
credit and $1.61 billion in term loans, all denominated in
Canadian dollars,  Standard & Poorâ€™s  said in a Feb. 3 ratings
report. Proceeds will be used to repay debt, purchase cable and
telecommunications assets, and pay a one-time dividend to parent
Oxford Communications Inc., S&P said.  The ratings company graded the new loans BB, two levels
below investment grade, and assigned the company a BB- rating,
three levels below investment grade.  Bragg has about $1.49 billion of loans and bonds maturing
through 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
