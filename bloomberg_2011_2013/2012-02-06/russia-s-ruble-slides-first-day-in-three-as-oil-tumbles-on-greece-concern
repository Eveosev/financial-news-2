The ruble appreciated to a three-
month high against the dollar as record-low temperatures in
 Europe  drove demand for oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner.  The Russian currency advanced 0.2 percent to 30.12 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the highest level since
Oct. 28. The ruble rose 0.5 percent to 39.34 per euro and 0.4
percent to 34.269 versus the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket.  Brent futures rose 0.5 percent to $115.13 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange as unusually cold weather in Europe
from a wave of Siberian air spurred demand for fuel. Russia is
the world’s largest energy exporter.  “The oil price in absolute terms is relatively high, so
when global concern subsides over the European situation I’d
expect these  oil prices  to be supportive for the ruble,”
 Yaroslav Lissovolik , chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG in
Moscow, said by phone.  Investors pared bets the ruble would weaken, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the Russian currency at 30.473 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 30.4985 on
Feb. 3. Russia’s 2020 dollar bonds rose, pushing the yield down
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.285 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
