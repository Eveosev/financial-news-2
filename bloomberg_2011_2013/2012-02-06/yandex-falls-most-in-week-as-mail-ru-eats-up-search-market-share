Yandex NV  had its biggest drop in a
week after a report showed that the operator of  Russia ’s most
popular Internet search engine saw its market share decline
while competitor Mail.ru Group’s increased.  Yandex’s U.S.-traded shares  fell  1.5 percent to $21.50 in
 New York , the largest retreat since Jan. 30.  Based in The Hague, Netherlands, Yandex saw its share of
the Russian search market decline to 59.3 percent in the week
through Feb. 5, from 59.4 percent the previous week and below
the four-week average of 59.6 percent,  Liveintenet.ru , an
Internet-service provider and researcher, reported today on its
website. The share of Mail.ru, the largest Russian-language
 Internet company , rose to 9.3 percent from 9 percent in the
previous week and was above a four-week average of 8.7 percent,
the data showed.  “Yandex share is deteriorating and has been falling since
the beginning of December, while Mail.ru has continued to gain
market share,” David Ferguson and Anastasia Demidova, Moscow-
based analysts at brokerage  Renaissance Capital , wrote in a
report e-mailed today, citing Liveinternet data. “Our
preference remains Mail.ru.”  Global depositary receipts of  Mail.ru  rose 0.5 percent to
$34.28 in  London  and have climbed 32 percent this year. Yandex
 is trading  at 37 times analysts’ earnings estimates, compared
with 44 times for Mail.ru, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Yandex reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 22 and
Moscow-based Mail.ru releases its 2011 results on Feb. 24.  Google Inc. ’s share of the Russian search market fell to
25.3 percent from 25.5 percent, compared with a four-week
average of 25.6 percent, the Liveinternet.ru data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
