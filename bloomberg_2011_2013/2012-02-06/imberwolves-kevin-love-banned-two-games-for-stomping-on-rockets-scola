Minnesota  Timberwolves All-Star
forward Kevin Love was suspended without pay for two games after
stomping on the head of the Houston Rockets’ Luis Scola, while
Los Angeles Lakers coach Mike Brown was given a one-game ban
after making contact with a referee, the National Basketball
Association said.  Love was suspended for “driving his foot into the upper
body and face” of Scola, who had fallen to the floor because of
a hard arm swipe by Love during the Timberwolves’ 100-91 win
over the Rockets in Minneapolis on Feb. 4. Love, who was unhappy
over a non-call at the other end of the floor before knocking
down Scola, then turned and stepped on Scola as he was running
back down the court.  The 23-year-old Love will miss Minnesota’s home game
tomorrow against the  Sacramento Kings  and a road contest the
following day at the Memphis Grizzlies, the league said in a
statement.  Brown was suspended without pay and fined $25,000 for
making contact with a game official and failing to leave the
court in a timely manner after being ejected from the Lakers’
96-87 loss at the  Utah Jazz  two days ago. He’ll serve the
suspension tonight when the Lakers visit the  Philadelphia 76ers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
