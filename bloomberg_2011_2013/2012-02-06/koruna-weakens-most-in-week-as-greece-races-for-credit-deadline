The koruna weakened the first time in
four days on speculation  Greece  may run out of time to reach a
deal with creditors, eroding demand for riskier emerging-market
assets.  The Czech currency depreciated as much as 0.6 percent and
traded less than 0.1 percent weaker at 24.945 per euro by 4:35
p.m. in Prague. The PX equity  gauge  rose 0.2 percent to 1,011.30
after dropping as much as 1.4 percent earlier today.  European leaders stepped up pressure on Greek politicians
to meet the conditions of a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion)
bailout, saying time was running out, while a gathering of Greek
political leaders was delayed until tomorrow as they struggled
for a unified response.  To contact the reporter on this story:
