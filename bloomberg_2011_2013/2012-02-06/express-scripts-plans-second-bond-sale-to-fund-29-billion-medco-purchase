Express Scripts Inc. , the pharmacy-
benefits manager planning to buy  Medco Health Solutions Inc. (MHS) ,
raised $3.5 billion in a second bond sale to help fund the $29.1
billion acquisition.  Express Scripts issued $1 billion of three-year notes, $1.5
billion of five-year debt and $1 billion of securities due in 10
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company will
use the proceeds to help pay back $14 billion of bridge loans it
took on for the purchase, the St. Louis-based company said today
in a statement.  The company, which is seeking approval from the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission to complete the deal in the first half
of 2012, needs $11 billion to $12 billion of debt to complete
the cash part of the acquisition, Fitch Ratings analysts led by
Bob Kirby said in a report today. The company sold $4.1 billion
of debt in November to cut the bridge loan.  The three-year notes pay a 2.1 percent coupon, or 195 basis
points more than Treasuries with similar maturities, Bloomberg
data show. The five-year, 2.65 percent bonds were issued at a
210 basis-point premium, while the spread on the 10-year, 3.9
percent notes was 225 basis points.  In November,  Express Scripts  issued $900 million of 2.75
percent, three-year notes yielding 240 basis points more than
Treasuries with similar maturities; $1.25 billion of 3.5
percent, five-year notes at a 260 basis-point spread, $1.25
billion of 4.75 percent, 10-year notes at 280 basis points more
than benchmarks and $700 million of 6.125 percent, 30-year bonds
at a 305 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Bond Provision  The bonds issued today, like the November offering, include
a provision that requires them to be redeemed at 101 cents on
the dollar if the acquisition isnâ€™t completed by a certain date,
according to a person with knowledge of the offering, who
declined to be identified as the details were private. A filing
with the November notes said that would be on or before April
20.  Express Scripts got commitments for the one-year bridge
facility in July. Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. each
agreed to provide half of the principal amount, according to a
regulatory filing on July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
