A professor at the University of
Padua in  Italy  today unveiled a test version of a search engine
that allows users to connect with others interested in the same
subjects.  The  Volunia  search engine, which will cover 12 languages,
has “a new radical idea of what a search engine of the future
could be,” Massimo Marchiori, said in a video posted on the
Web.  Marchiori is author of several Web standards, according to
a PR Newswire statement. He was first to introduce the concept
of hyper-information in search engines, an idea later developed
by companies such as  Google Inc. (GOOG) , according to Marchiori’s
 biography  on the university’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
