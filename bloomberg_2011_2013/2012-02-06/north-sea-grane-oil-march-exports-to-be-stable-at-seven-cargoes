Exports of the North Sea Grane crude
for March will be unchanged from this month at seven cargoes of
600,000 barrels each, according to a loading program obtained by

Grane field.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
