Spain ’s suspension of subsidies for
renewable energy in January has left 11,080 megawatts of wind-
park projects with no way forward, Cinco Dias reported.  The measure, carried out by the new national government
that took power in December, is the second obstacle for the
projects that had been awarded by nine regional governments over
the last two years, the newspaper said.   Those planned wind-energy stations already were restrained
by last month’s expiration of the law that underpinned their
incentives, Cinco Dias reported, citing unidentified people in
the industry.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
