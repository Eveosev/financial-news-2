Credit-default swaps insuring debt of
 Fiat SpA (F)  rose after Standard & Poor’s said the Italian carmaker
may face a downgrade because of weakening demand in Europe.  The contracts jumped 53 basis points to 755.35 basis
points, according to CMA at 10 a.m. in London. An increase in
the cost of credit-default swaps signals deteriorating
perceptions of  credit quality .  “We see weakening demand in Europe’s oversupplied mass
vehicle market, particularly Italy’s,” Robert E. Richards, an
analyst for S&P in Frankfurt, said in a statement.  S&P may lower Fiat’s rating by one level to BB- within the
next 90 days, Richards said.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
