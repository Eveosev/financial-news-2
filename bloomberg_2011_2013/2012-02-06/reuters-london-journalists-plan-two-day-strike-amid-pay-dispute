About 180 journalists working for
 Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI)  in  London  are planning a 48-hour strike
this week, the first in more than 25 years, according to a union
representative.  The New-York-based company is prepared to offer a 3 percent
pay increase with 1.25 percent of that amount awarded on a merit
basis, not enough to offset U.K. inflation, said Barry
Fitzpatrick, deputy general secretary for the National Union of
Journalists. The union will meet with management tomorrow to
discuss whether a strike may be averted, Fitzpatrick said in a
telephone interview today.  “We respect the right of our colleagues to engage in this
job action as part of the bargaining process and look forward to
welcoming them back to work on their next work day,” Stephen Adler, editor-in-chief of Reuters News, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
 Thomson Reuters  in selling financial and legal information and
trading systems.  To contact the reporters on this story:
