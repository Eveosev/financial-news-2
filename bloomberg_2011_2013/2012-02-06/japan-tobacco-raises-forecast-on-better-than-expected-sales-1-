Japan Tobacco Inc. , the world’s
second-largest listed cigarette maker, climbed the most in four
months in  Tokyo  trading after raising its profit forecast and
planned dividend.  Japan Tobacco  gained 5.5 percent, the biggest advance since
Sept. 20, to 406,500 yen at the close of trade in Tokyo.  A faster-than-expected sales recovery after the March 11
earthquake prompted the company to raise its full-year  net
income  forecast by 17 percent to 189 billion yen ($2.5 billion),
following a 34 percent gain in nine-month profit. Tokyo-based
Japan Tobacco will also boost its annual dividend payout to a
record, it said yesterday.  “Their results and dividends are good and their payout
will improve, so I think this is a winner,” Mikihiko Yamato, an
analyst at JI  Asia  in Tokyo, said by telephone. “There is a
growing expectation that the company will increase dividends
further next quarter.”  Japan Tobacco  introduced seven redesigned Pianissimo thin
cigarettes and two Mild Seven slim types last month, to help
meet its goal to boost market share to 60 percent by March from
59 percent in December, it said in a statement.  Increased Sales  Sales for the year ending March 31 will probably climb to
2.54 trillion yen, compared with a previous estimate of 2.497
trillion yen. Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods
sold and operating expenses, will rise to 365 billion yen, more
than the earlier projected 329 billion yen, it said.  The company raised its planned second-half dividend to
5,000 yen a share. That will boost the full-year payout to 9,000
yen, from an earlier planned 8,000 yen, narrowing the gap with
rivals including  Philip Morris International Inc.  and  British
American Tobacco Plc.   Japan Tobacco currently has the lowest 12-month dividend
yield among the world’s five largest cigarette makers, based on
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Children’s Investment Fund
Management, a shareholder, has called for a dividend payout of
20,000 yen a share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
