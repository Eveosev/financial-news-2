The  New England Patriots  lead the  New
York  Giants 10-9 at halftime of the Super Bowl after a 96-yard
touchdown drive.  Tom Brady  threw a 4-yard scoring pass to Danny Woodhead
with eight seconds left in the second quarter to give  New
England  its first lead in the  National Football League ’s
championship game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The
Patriots trailed 9-0 after the first quarter.  The game is a rematch of the Super Bowl played four years
ago, when the Giants beat the Patriots 17-14 as 12-point
underdogs to spoil New England’s chance for a 19-0 season.  The Patriots (14-4) entered today’s game with a 10-game
winning streak and as 3-point favorites, according to
oddsmakers. The Giants (12-7), who won 24-20 in New England on
Nov. 6, have won five games in a row.  Both teams are seeking a fourth  Super Bowl  title.  The Giants took a 2-0 lead with nine minutes left in the
first quarter when Brady was flagged for intentional grounding
in the end zone on New England’s first offensive play. Brady was
in the pocket and being pressured by the Giants’ Justin Tuck
when he threw a pass toward midfield when there were no
receivers downfield.  New York pushed its lead to 9-0 with 3:29 left in the
opening quarter as  Victor Cruz  caught a 2-yard touchdown pass
from Eli Manning, making a juggling grab on a quick slant.  Patriots Rally  The Patriots then pulled within 9-3 on a 29-yard field goal
by Stephen Gostkowski with 13:52 left in the second quarter. New
England ended the half with a 14-play drive that started at its
4-yard line, matching the longest scoring drive in Super Bowl
history.  This is the first Super Bowl to feature opposing
quarterbacks who’d previously won the Super Bowl MVP.  New England’s Brady, whose five Super Bowl starts are tied
with  John Elway  for the most by a quarterback, is seeking to
join Joe  Montana  and Terry Bradshaw as the only quarterbacks to
win four championships in the Super Bowl era. Brady has
completed 15 of 18 passes for 147 yards.  New York’s Manning is seeking to join Brady and Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers as the only active
quarterbacks with multiple championships. Manning has connected
on 13 of 17 passes for 120 yards.  Giants coach Tom Coughlin could become the oldest coach to
win a Super Bowl at 65. The Patriots’ Bill Belichick can join
Chuck Noll as the only coach with four Super Bowl victories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
