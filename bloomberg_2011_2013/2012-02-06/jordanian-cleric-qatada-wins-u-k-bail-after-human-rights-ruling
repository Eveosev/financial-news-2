Jordanian Islamic cleric Abu Qatada,
who last month won a European Union court ruling to avoid
deportation on terrorism charges, was granted bail by a U.K.
court, Britain’s  Home Office  said.  Qatada, whose real name is Omar Othman, was granted bail
today by Judge John Mitting in London and faces a 22-hour curfew
when he’s released, the Home Office said today in a statement.
The ministry considers Qatada to be a threat to national
security and disagrees with the ruling, it said.  “This is a dangerous man who we believe poses a real
threat to our security and who has not changed in his views or
attitude to the U.K.,” Home Office spokeswoman Melanie Purkis
said in a statement. “We have argued for the strictest possible
bail conditions.”  Qatada can’t be deported to Jordan because courts there may
use evidence gained through torture, the  European Court of Human
Rights  ruled Jan. 17. The ruling blocked a 2009 U.K. decision
allowing him to be sent to Jordan for retrial after he was
convicted in absentia in 1999 and 2000 for involvement in
terrorist plots. The court ruled returning him to Jordan would
violate his rights.  Under the terms of the bail, Qatada will not be allowed to
access the Internet or have any access to electronic
communication devices, the Home Office said. He will also be
electronically monitored. Qatada has denied links to al-Qaeda.  A British man was kidnapped and killed in Niger in 2009 by
al-Qaeda’s north African network, which had threatened to kill
him if the U.K. didn’t release Qatada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
