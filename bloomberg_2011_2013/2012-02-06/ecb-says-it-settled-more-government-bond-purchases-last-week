The  European Central Bank  said it
increased its government bond purchases last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it settled 124 million euros
($162 million) of bond purchases in the week through Feb. 3, up
from 63 million euros the previous week. The ECB will take
seven-day term deposits tomorrow to absorb the 219 billion euros
of liquidity created since its Securities Markets Program
started in May 2010, a practice it employs to ensure the
purchases donâ€™t fuel inflation.  While yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds have
fallen since the ECB injected 489 billion euros in three-year
funds into the banking system in December, the yield on
Portuguese 10-year debt rose to a euro-era record last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
