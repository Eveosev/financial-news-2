President  Barack Obama  nominated  Air
Force  Lieutenant General Janet Wolfenbarger to be the service’s
first female four-star general and the military’s second woman
to reach the highest rank.  Wolfenbarger, the Air Force’s top uniformed official for
weapons development, was also nominated as commander of the Air
Force’s Materiel Command, according to a Defense Department
statement today. The positions are subject to Senate
confirmation.  The first woman with four stars in the U.S. military, Army
General Ann Dunwoody, was confirmed in 2008 and is commanding
general of that service’s Materiel Command.  Wolfenbarger is military deputy in the office of the
assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition at the
Pentagon. She previously served as vice commander of the
Materiel Command, which conducts research, development and
testing and manages acquisition and logistics for war. The
command is located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in  Ohio .  Wolfenbarger was commissioned in 1980 as a graduate of the
U.S. Air Force Academy in  Colorado Springs , Colorado, according
to the service’s website. She has held positions in several
command headquarters, the F-22 fighter jet program and the B-2
bomber program.  In addition to her bachelor’s degree from the academy,
Wolfenbarger has two master’s degrees, one in aeronautics and
astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, and another in national resource strategy from the
Industrial College of the Armed Forces at the National Defense
University in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
