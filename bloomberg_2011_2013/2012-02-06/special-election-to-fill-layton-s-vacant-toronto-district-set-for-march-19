A special election will be held March
19 to fill the vacant district in Toronto that was held by
Canadian opposition leader  Jack Layton .  Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  announced the date of the
election in an updated  press release  today. Harper’s office said
yesterday the vote would take March 12. A spokeswoman for Harper
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail requesting comment on
the change.  The seat became vacant following Layton’s death in August
at age 61. Layton had led his New Democratic Party to its best-
ever showing in the May 2 election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
