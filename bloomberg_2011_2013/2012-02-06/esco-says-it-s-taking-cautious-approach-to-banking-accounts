Tesco Plc,  the U.K.’s largest grocery
chain, said it’s taking a “cautious approach” to introducing
new banking products after a report that it will delay the start
of checking accounts until next year.  The timing of product introductions has not yet been
confirmed, a spokeswoman for Tesco Bank said today by e-mail,
adding that offering so-called current accounts to customers is
still a central part of its plans.  Tesco has previously said it would start offering current
accounts in 2012. In today’s statement, the Cheshunt, England-
based grocer said the product is still in a development phase
and won’t be introduced until it is right for customers and
systems to change accounts are introduced.  Postponing the plan until 2013 will allow the company to
take advantage of rule changes facilitating customer movement to
Tesco from other banks, the Times reported today, citing Tesco
Bank Chief Executive Officer Benny Higgins.  The news won’t affect Tesco’s share price, according to
Caroline Gulliver, an analyst at Execution Noble in  London , who
said investors are more concerned about Tesco’s plans for
reviving its domestic grocery business.  The retailer reported last month Christmas sales that
missed analyst estimates and reined back profit expectations as
it struggled to fend off competitors’ increased promotions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
