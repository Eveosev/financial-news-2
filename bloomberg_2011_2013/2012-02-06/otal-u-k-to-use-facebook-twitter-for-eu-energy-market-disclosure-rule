Total SA ,  France ’s biggest oil
company, will use social media websites Facebook Inc. and
Twitter Inc. to comply with European Union energy market
disclosure rules at its U.K. exploration and production unit.  “Facebook and Twitter will now be TOTAL E&P U.K.’s
principal means of communicating information about unplanned
production outages (24/7) under the new REMIT regulations,” the
oil and natural gas producer based in Paris said in an e-mail.
Total began using that method for communications as of Jan. 30
and hasn’t had an outage since then,  Brian O’Neill , an Aberdeen,
Scotland-based company spokesman, said today by phone.  European Union Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and
Transparency, known as REMIT, established stricter monitoring of
natural gas and electricity markets. The rules, which entered
into force on Dec. 28, may increase transparency enough to
prompt small companies as well as banks and funds to participate
more in energy markets. REMIT will be fully  implemented  by the
middle of 2013, according to the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
