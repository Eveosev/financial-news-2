U.S. and European  stocks  fell,
driving the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  down from an almost
four-year high, and the euro declined the most in three weeks as
Greek leaders wrestled with spending cuts to get aid and avert a
default. German bonds rose, and commodities dropped.  The Dow slumped 17.10 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,845.13
at 4 p.m.  New York  time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped
less than 0.1 percent, trimming its retreat from 0.6 percent as
energy stocks rallied 1.1 percent. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index 
lost 0.1 percent. The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3132 after
slipping 1 percent. Yields on 10-year German bonds slipped five
basis points to 1.89 percent. Oil decreased 1 percent. Copper
futures sank 0.9 percent.  European leaders stepped up pressure on Greek politicians
to accept the conditions for a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion)
bailout, saying time was running out. French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  met German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  today, while a
gathering of Greek political leaders was delayed until tomorrow
as they struggled for a unified response. China’s economic
growth would be cut almost in half if  Europe ’s debt crisis
worsens, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  “We are entering into a fairly critical 24 hours for
Greece,”  Jim Reid , a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in  London ,
wrote in a report. “The focus has shifted from the private
sector involvement negotiations toward the lack of political
consensus and whether the interim coalition government will
accept the conditions” for its second bailout package, he said.  Best Since 1987  U.S. stocks fell after the  S&P 500  posted a fifth weekly
rally, the longest winning streak since January 2011, and rose
6.9 percent this year for the best annual start since 1987.
Financial institutions posted the  biggest  decline today among 10
industries, followed by raw-material producers. Indexes for both
S&P 500 groups retreated 0.5 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 ended a four-day advance as basic-
resources companies and insurers  led  losses.  The euro depreciated 0.2 percent to 100.57 yen and slumped
0.2 percent versus the Swiss franc. The  Dollar Index , which
tracks the U.S. currency against those of six trading partners,
advanced 0.1 percent after gaining as much as 0.8 percent.  Oil in New York dropped to $96.91 a barrel, while copper
futures slumped to $3.8645 a pound.  China  is the biggest buyer
of the metal.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  fell 0.2 percent. Romania’s
BET Index slipped 1.2 percent, the most since Nov. 28, after
Prime Minister Emil Boc resigned following protests over his
government’s austerity measures including a 25 percent public-
wage cut turned violent and lenders ended a review of the Balkan
nation’s bailout loan.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index  jumped 1.2 percent
after the central bank cut lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios,
while India’s  benchmark index  rose 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
