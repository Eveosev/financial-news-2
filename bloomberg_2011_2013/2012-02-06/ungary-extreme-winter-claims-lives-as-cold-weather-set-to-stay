Extreme cold weather claimed more
than five lives in  Hungary  over the weekend as some schools were
closed and settlements temporarily sealed off.  Southeastern regions of the country were blanketed with as
much as 60 centimeters (24 inches) of snow and temperatures
dropped to below minus 20 degrees Celsius nationwide, the
coldest weather since 1987, according to the  National
Meteorological Service .  Five people froze to death over the weekend and a homeless
man died in a fire he set to keep warm in an abandoned building,
police said yesterday.  Temperatures are set to hover around minus 20 degrees this
week with more snowfall and blizzards forecast for today,
according to the meteorological service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
