Zimbabwe’s former football
association chief executive officer, Henrietta Rushwaya, was
charged with bribery, corruption and match fixing related to
unsanctioned national team games in  Asia .  Rushwaya was released on $500 bail, Magistrate Anita Tshuma
said today in Harare, the capital.  Rushwaya, who left the organization in 2010, denied
wrongdoing. “It is not the first time the case has been brought
before the courts,” she told reporters. “It is nice the case
has started.”  The  Zimbabwe Football Association  last week suspended 82
players from representing the country after probing alleged
match fixing of games against  Thailand  and  Syria  in 2008. The
southern African nation’s team lost 6-0 to Syria and 3-0 to
Thailand.  Among those suspended are Ovidy Karuru, a player for U.S.
Boulogne, a team in  France ’s second division, and South African
based players including Thomas Sweswe and Willard Katsande of
Johannesburg’s Kaizer Chiefs.  Zimbabwe has plummeted down FIFA’s ranking of national
teams, falling out of the top 100 in a Jan. 18 assessment after
dropping 28 places to 98th in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
