President  Barack Obama ’s approval
rating has climbed to 50 percent and a majority of voters for
the first time favor Obama over former Massachusetts Governor
Mitt Romney, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll.  The poll, conducted last week and released today, showed
that, in a head-to-head contest, Obama leads Romney, the current
front-runner for the Republican nomination, 51-45 percent among
registered voters and 52-43 percent among all Americans.  The results of the head-to-head match-up were a reversal of
last month’s Post/ABC poll, which gave Romney a two percentage
point lead over Obama, 48-46 percent, among registered voters
and a one percentage point lead, 47-46 percent, among all
Americans.  Obama’s approval rating was the highest since the killing
of  Osama bin Laden  in early May. Nearly as many Americans
surveyed -- 46 percent -- disapprove as approve of the
president’s performance in office, the poll found. Among
registered voters, 49 percent said Obama deserves a second term
and 49 percent said he didn’t.  Among political independents, who may determine the outcome
of the Nov. 6 election, 47 percent approve and 50 percent
disapprove of the way Obama is handling his job, according to
the poll. His approval rating among independents has climbed
from a low of 34 percent in the fall and is up from 37 percent a
month ago.  The telephone poll conducted Feb. 1-4 among a random
national sample of 1,000 adults has a margin of error of plus or
minus four percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
