The southern Bulgarian village of
Biser near the Greek border was flooded after a dam of the
nearby Ivanovo reservoir burst amid heavy rains preceded by snow
storms.  The 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) high flood wave swept the village
at around 7:30 a.m. Sofia time, Nikolai Nikolov, director of
civil defense at the Interior Ministry, said in an interview
with radio Horizont today. Three elderly men were found dead, of
the 800 people living in the village, Nikolai Valchev, head of
civil defense in the city of Haskovo, near the flooded area,
told reporters today.  “Rescue workers on boats have reached most of the houses
in the village and 50 people have been salvaged so far,”
Valchev said. “Army helicopters are helping speed up the rescue
operation.”  Bulgaria ’s southern cities of Haskovo, Harmanli and
Kardjali near the Greek and Turkish borders declared state of
emergency as nine small water reservoirs are spilling over after
snow and rain fall in the past two days exceeded 200 liters per
square meter, regional governor Ivanka Taushanova, told
reporters today. Three villages in the area have been evacuated.  Prime Minister  Boiko Borissov  arrived in the affected areas
to oversee the situation. Heavy snow storms and record-low
temperatures over the past two weeks have blocked many regions
in the Balkan country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
