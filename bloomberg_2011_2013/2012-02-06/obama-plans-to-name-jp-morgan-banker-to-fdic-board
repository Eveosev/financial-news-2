President Barack Obama today
nominated a  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  executive to the five-member
board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Jeremiah O. Norton, 34, who is an  executive director  in the
bank’s JPMorgan Securities unit, previously served as a policy
adviser in the U.S. Treasury Department during the
administration of President  George W. Bush . Before that, he was
an aide to a Republican congressman, Edward Royce of  California .  Norton joins two Democrats and a fellow Republican whose
confirmations to FDIC leadership posts have been delayed by
Senate Republicans who have complained that Obama used a recess
appointment to install Richard Cordray, a former Ohio attorney
general, as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
without formal Senate approval. Cordray, in his role as consumer
bureau director, also has a seat on the five-member FDIC board.  Martin J. Gruenberg, the White House pick to serve as head
of the FDIC, is working in an acting capacity.  Thomas Hoenig ,
the FDIC’s nominee for vice chairman, is waiting for
confirmation. Thomas J. Curry, Obama’s nominee to lead the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is serving as a
director of the FDIC while he awaits confirmation to the new
post.  All three were approved by the Senate Banking Committee
with bipartisan support and have been awaiting final
confirmation by the full chamber.  To contact the reporters on this story:
