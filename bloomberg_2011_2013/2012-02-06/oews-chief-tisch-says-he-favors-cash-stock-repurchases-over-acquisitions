Loews Corp. (L) , the company run by New
York’s Tisch family, said it prefers to buy back shares rather
than pursue acquisitions at a time when there are few purchase
opportunities and the economic outlook is “not clear.”  “There really aren’t a lot of properties or assets that
are for sale at prices that I think would be attractive for
Loews shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer James Tisch said
today in a conference call. “We’re happy to repurchase shares
and we’re happy to have significant amounts of cash on our
balance sheet. So we don’t feel any strong urge or itch to go
out and do a big deal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
