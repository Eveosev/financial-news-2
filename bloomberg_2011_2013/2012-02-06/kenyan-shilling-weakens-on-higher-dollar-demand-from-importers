Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
second time in three days off the back of higher dollar demand.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.6 percent and traded 0.4 percent lower at 83.95 per
dollar as of 1:03 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling has weakened on increased dollar demand by
businesses,” Chris Muiga a senior dealer at Nairobi-based Kenya
Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Tanzania’s shilling strengthened as the central bank sold
dollars in the market. The currency of East Africa’s second-
biggest economy appreciated as much as 0.4 percent and traded
0.2 percent higher at 1,592 as of 1:37 p.m.  “The shilling is gaining as the central bank is supplying
dollars to meet demand from the oil sector,” Hakim Sheik, a
dealer with Commercial Bank of Africa Tanzania Ltd., said today
by phone from  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital.  Uganda’s shilling appreciated as much as 0.4 percent and
traded 0.1 percent higher at 2,316.25 per dollar as of 1:06 p.m.  -- With assistance from David Malingha Doya in Dar es Salaam.
