Creditors Tennenbaum Capital Partners
LLC and Z Capital Partners LLC are poised to take control of Sun
Capital Partners Inc.’s Real Mex Restaurants Inc. as part of a
reorganization, said two people with knowledge of the talks.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., a creditor, also will take a stake in
the company, said the people, who asked not to be named because
the talks are private.  Real Mex , purchased by an affiliate of
Sun Capital in 2006 for $359 million, operates the El Torito,
Acapulco and Chevys Fresh Mex restaurant chains. It may emerge
from bankruptcy under new ownership as early as March, the
people said.  Real Mex, which has almost 200 restaurants, filed for
Chapter 11 protection on Oct. 4 with $272.2 million of assets
and $250 million of debt. Revenue of $243.4 million in the first
half of 2011 resulted in a $67.4 million operating loss and a
net loss of $81.7 million for the Cypress, California-based
company.  Representatives of Tennenbaum and Z Capital declined to
comment. Representatives for JPMorgan and Real Mex didn’t return
calls seeking comment.  Sun Capital affiliate RM Restaurant Holding Corp. and RM
Integrated Inc. bought Real Mex in 2006. Sun Capital, based in
 Boca Raton ,  Florida , has invested in more than 290 companies
since the buyout firm was founded in 1995.  Tennenbaum Capital, a Los Angeles-based hedge fund with
about $5 billion under management, was founded by Michael Tennenbaum in 1999. Z Capital, a private-equity firm based in
 Chicago  founded by James Zenni, is among the creditors that took
control of cookie chain Mrs. Fields Famous Brands LLC last year.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
