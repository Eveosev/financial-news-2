Hungary ’s central bank needs
additional powers to fend off financial imbalances which it
can’t correct via  interest rates , according to Ferenc Karvalits,
the bank’s vice president.  “In several countries of the world, the central bank’s
powers are expanded, turning them into so-called macro-
prudential authorities,” Karvalits wrote in an opinion piece
for  Nepszabadsag  newspaper, published today. “With new tools,
the central bank can more efficiently support a stable,
predictable growth path.”  Hungary’s inflation has swung in recent years because of
tax changes, weather fluctuations affecting food prices and
volatile oil markets, Karvalits said.  “While we can’t take out insurance against the weather and
oil prices, we trust that with the solidifying of the budget
situation the period of government-induced inflation shocks ends
and inflation becomes much more stable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
