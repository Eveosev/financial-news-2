KT Corp. (030200) ,  South Korea ’s largest phone
and Internet company, reported a 13 percent increase in fourth-
quarter profit as a one-time gain masked higher costs and
falling sales from phone calls.  Net income  rose to 210.6 billion won ($188 million) from a
revised 187.1 billion won a year earlier, the Seongnam, South
Korea-based company said in a statement today. The result
compares with the 211.3 billion won average of 14 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  KT booked a one-time gain of 295.8 billion won from selling
real estate, offsetting a 28 percent increase in operational
costs and lower revenue from both mobile and fixed-lined calls,
it said. The carrier joined local competitors SK Telecom Co. and
LG Uplus Corp. in reporting earnings that were eroded by
government-initiated tariff cuts and competition to lure
subscribers.  “Even if you factor in seasonality, it’s pretty bad
earnings,” Kim Hue Jae, a Seoul-based analyst at Daishin
Securities Co., said by telephone. “The tariff cuts are
affecting all three carriers. On top of that, what’s making
things worse for KT is falling revenue from the fixed-line
business. It’s hard to expect a dramatic improvement in KT’s
earnings this year.”  Operating profit , or sales excluding the cost of goods sold
and administrative expenses, fell 17 percent to 287.6 billion
won. Sales increased 25 percent to 6.4 trillion won.  Mobile-Phone Calls  KT  fell 0.6 percent to 33,500 won at the close of trading
in Seoul, while the benchmark Kospi index was little changed.  The figures released today, including year-earlier results,
were based on the International Financial Reporting Standards
that the company began to use in 2011.  Revenue  from mobile-phone calls fell 25 percent after KT
began to lower telephone bills in October to help the government
curb inflation, even as the number of smartphone users more than
doubled, the company said. Sales from the fixed-line business
declined 11 percent.  KT began in October to cut basic mobile-phone fees by 1,000
won and offer 50 free  text messages , a month after SK Telecom
started offering similar discounts under an agreement with the
government. SK Telecom reported a 61 percent decline in fourth-
quarter profit last week.  Marketing Costs  Marketing costs rose 14.5 percent as the carrier increased
spending on promotions to avoid losing subscribers to rivals
that began fourth-generation services earlier. The company spent
an additional 110 billion won to switch its second-generation
networks to 4G service using the long-term evolution, or LTE,
technology, KT said.  SK Telecom and LG Uplus began LTE services in Seoul in
July, and KT followed last month after a court blocked its plan
to use its 2G networks for the next-generation service.  The number of SK Telecom LTE users surpassed 1 million on
Jan. 31, the company said on the day.  KT aims for 20 trillion won in revenue in 2012, compared
with 22 trillion won last year, the company said. The carrier
plans to spend 3.5 trillion won this year, after 3.3 trillion
won of capital expenditure in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
