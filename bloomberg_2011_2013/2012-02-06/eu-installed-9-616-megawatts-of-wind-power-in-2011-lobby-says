The European Union installed 9,616
megawatts of  wind energy  in 2011, or 21 percent of the bloc’s
new power capacity, the European Wind Energy Association said.  Investment totaled 12.6 billion euros ($16.4 billion),
about the same as in 2010, the Brussels-based lobby group EWEA
said today in a  report  on its website.  Germany  installed more
than a fifth of the bloc’s new turbines, followed by the U.K.
with 13 percent, then Spain and  Italy , respectively with 11
percent and 10 percent.  The EU is chasing a target of getting 20 percent of all
energy for power, heating and transport from renewables by 2020.
At the same time, governments across the bloc are cutting
subsidies to reduce budget deficits.  Spain  last month halted
subsidies for renewable energy projects to rein in spending,
while in the U.K. lawmakers are campaigning against wind power.  “Despite the economic crisis gripping  Europe , the wind
industry is still installing solid levels of new capacity,”
EWEA Policy Director Justin Wilkes said in an e-mailed
statement. “It is critical to send positive signals to
investors by European governments maintaining stable policies to
support renewables.”  The 27-nation EU now has a total of 93,957 megawatts of
installed wind power capacity, about 10.5 percent of the bloc’s
total power generation installations, according to EWEA. Because
wind is intermittent, in a typical year, that capacity would
produce 6.3 percent of the EU’s electricity, the group said.  A third of U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservative
Party lawmakers signed a letter urging him to cut subsidies for
onshore wind farms, lawmaker Chris Heaton-Harris, who organized
it, said yesterday in a blog posting.  U.K. Ambition  “It is unwise to make consumers pay, through taxpayer
subsidy, for inefficient and intermittent energy production,”
the legislators said in the  letter , dated Jan. 30. “We ask the
government to dramatically cut the subsidy for onshore wind and
spread the savings made between other types of reliable
renewable energy production and energy efficiency measures.”  The U.K. last year installed 1,293 megawatts of turbines,
bringing its total to 6,540 megawatts, according to EWEA. Of
last year’s new devices, 752 megawatts were offshore. Britain in
July said it wants total wind installations to reach 31,000
megawatts by 2020, with 18,000 megawatts of it offshore.  Across the EU, solar photovoltaic power took 46.7 percent
of installations of new electricity capacity last year, followed
by gas, at 21.6 percent, and then wind, according to EWEA.
Renewables accounted for 71.3 percent of added power generation,
the wind group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
