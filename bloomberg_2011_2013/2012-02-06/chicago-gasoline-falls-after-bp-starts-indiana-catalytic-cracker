Chicago gasoline weakened after  BP
Plc (BP)  returned a fluid catalytic cracker that was shut last week
for unplanned repairs at the Whiting refinery in Indiana.  The unit, one of two catalytic crackers at the 420,000-
barrel-a-day plant, returned to service by Feb. 4, said a person
with knowledge of the incident.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  widened 2 cents to 17.5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:36 p.m. Prompt
delivery fell 0.44 cent to $2.755 a gallon.  The same fuel in  New York Harbor (MOSNY87P)  was unchanged at a 2-cent
premium to futures. Prompt delivery rose 1.35 cents to $2.9479 a
gallon.  PBF Energy Inc. reported a compressor went offline at the
 Delaware  City, Delaware, refinery, according to a filing with
state regulators. The incident caused the release of about 1,700
pounds of sulfur dioxide, the filing showed.  Michael Karlovich, a PBF spokesman in Parsippany, New
Jersey, where the company is based, said he wasn’t certain
whether the compressor had returned to service. “All operations
are routine,” he said during a telephone call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
