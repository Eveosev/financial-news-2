The  New England Patriots  kicked a
field goal to trail the New York Giants 9-3 during the second
quarter of the Super Bowl.  Each team is seeking a fourth win in the National Football
League championship game. The Giants last took the title by
beating the Patriots after the 2007 season, while New England
hasnâ€™t won since beating the  Philadelphia Eagles  following the
2004 campaign.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
