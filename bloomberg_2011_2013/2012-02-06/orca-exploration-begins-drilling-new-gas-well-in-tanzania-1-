Orca Exploration Group Inc. (ORC/B) ’s
Tanzanian unit said it started drilling a new production well at
the offshore Songo Songo gas field that is expected to almost
double the company’s output.  The SS-11 well will increase production to more than 200
million standard cubic feet per day “in the coming months,”
from 113 million standard cubic feet per day now, PanAfrican
Energy Tanzania Ltd. said today in an e-mailed statement in  Dar
es Salaam , the commercial capital.  The project is part of a $130 million investment plan under
which the company imported the Sakson PR5 rig for drilling,
according to the statement. PanAfrican also plans to drill a $35
million offshore well under the same project.  “We’re looking forward to continuing to work with our
partners to help meet Tanzania’s energy needs,” said PanAfrican
General Manager Andrew Brown said in the statement.  Tanzania,  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy, may have as
much as 10 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, Energy Minister
William Ngeleja said in September. About 85 percent of
PanAfrican’s gas production is supplied to the Tanzania Electric
Supply Co. to generate power, according to PanAfrican.  The country has two gas deposits in commercial production.
Songo Songo holds 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas, while Mnazi
Bay, near the border with  Mozambique , has 2 trillion cubic feet,
the state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. said in
October 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
