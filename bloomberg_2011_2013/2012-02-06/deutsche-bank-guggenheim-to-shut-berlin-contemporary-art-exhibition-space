Deutsche Bank AG  and the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Foundation today announced plans to close the
 Deutsche Guggenheim  contemporary-art exhibition space on
Berlin’s Unter den Linden.  Neither Deutsche Bank nor the Guggenheim Foundation gave a
reason for the decision in statements sent by e-mail, beyond
saying that their contract expires at the end of 2012. In the
past 14 years, the Deutsche Guggenheim has hosted 57 exhibitions
and attracted 1.8 million visitors.  Deutsche Bank plans to use the space on Berlin’s central
boulevard as a forum “for intensified dialogue between the
business and political worlds,” Josef Ackermann, the bank’s
chief executive officer, said in its statement.  The bank and the foundation together commissioned artworks
from 17 artists that were exhibited in Berlin,  New York  and
Bilbao. Among them were Jeff Koons, William Kentridge, Jeff
Wall, Bill Viola, Rachel Whiteread and Anish Kapoor.  “We feel the time is now right to step back and re-examine
our collaboration, to see how it might evolve,” Richard
Armstrong, director of the Guggenheim museum and foundation,
said in an e-mailed statement.  Deutsche Bank has one of the world’s largest corporate art
collections, with more than 56,000 works. Artists represented in
the collection include  Gerhard Richter , Georg Baselitz,  Sigmar Polke  and Andreas Gursky.  To contact the reporter on the story:
