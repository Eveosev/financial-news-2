The  New York Giants  kicked a field goal
to trail the  New England Patriots  17-12 during the third quarter
of the  Super Bowl .  The Giants went ahead in the first quarter when Patriots
quarterback Tom Brady was called for intentional grounding while
in his own end zone, resulting in a safety. Victor Cruz then
collected a 2-yard scoring pass from Giants quarterback Eli Manning to make it 9-0 at the end of the opening quarter.  Stephen Gostkowski kicked a 29-yard field goal for the
Patriots at the start of the second quarter and Brady found
Danny Woodhead with a 4-yard touchdown pass eight seconds before
halftime to make it 10-9 to New England at Lucas Oil Stadium in
Indianapolis.  The Patriots extended their lead to 17-9 after the opening
possession of the third quarter when Brady found Aaron Hernandez
with a 12-yard pass to end an eight play, 79-yard drive.  Lawrence Tynes  of the Giants then kicked a 38-yard field
goal to make it 17-12 to the Patriots.  Each team is seeking a fourth win in the National Football
League championship game. The Giants last claimed the title by
beating the Patriots after the 2007 season, while New England
hasnâ€™t won since beating the Philadelphia Eagles following the
2004 campaign.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
