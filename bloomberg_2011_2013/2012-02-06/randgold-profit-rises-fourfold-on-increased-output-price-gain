Randgold Resources , a miner of the
precious metal in  Africa , said fourth-quarter profit rose more
than fourfold after production increased and prices gained.  Net income climbed to $115.5 million from $26.8 million a
year earlier, the  Jersey , Channel Islands-based company said
today in a statement. Sales more than doubled to $313.6 million.  Gold producers’ profits have been buoyed by near-record
prices for bullion as Europe’s sovereign-debt woes and central
banks’ money-printing spurred demand for precious metals. Gold
for immediate delivery averaged $1,683 an ounce in the fourth
quarter, compared with $1,370 a year earlier.  Randgold, which produced 696,023 ounces of gold in 2011,
targets output of 825,000 ounces to 865,000 this year. It plans
to produce about 950,000 ounces next year and 1.2 million ounces
in 2015. The company proposed doubling its dividend to 40 cents
a share.  Randgold rose 165 pence, or 2.2 percent, to 7,565 pence by
the close in  London  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
