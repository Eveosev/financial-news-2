INA Industrija Nafte d.d ., the
Croatian  oil company  controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,
evacuated most of its workers out of Syria because of civil
unrest, Vecernji List reported, citing Predrag Primuzic, the
company’s site leader in Syria.  About 100 workers were evacuated, leaving only four at
INA’s facilities in Syria, according to Vecernji List.  Mol holds a 47.26 percent stake in INA, while the Croatian
government owns 44.84 percent of the country’s largest refiner.  In addition to 11 exploration and production plants in
continental Croatia and 19 off-shore platforms in the northern
Adriatic that are jointly owned with Italy’s ENI SpA and Edison
SpA, INA has upstream facilities in Syria, Egypt and Angola.  To contact the reporter on this story:
