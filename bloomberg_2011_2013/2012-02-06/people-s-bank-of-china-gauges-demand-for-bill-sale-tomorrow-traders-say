The People’s Bank of  China  gauged
demand for bill sales tomorrow, according to traders at primary
dealers required to bid at the auctions.  The central bank asked banks to submit orders for one-year
and three-month bills and 91-day and 28-day repurchase contracts
this morning, according to two traders who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  The central bank published last year a list of 50 primary
dealers allowed to participate in open-market operations,
including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.,
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp., China Citic Bank Corp., Industrial Bank
Co. and Postal Savings Bank of China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
