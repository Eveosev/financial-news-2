The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  may complete rules as soon as today requiring
registration by mutual funds when they have investments in
commodities, according to a person briefed on the matter.  The agency circulated the rule in a private voting process
among the CFTC’s five commissioners, according to the person who
declined to be identified because the process isn’t public.  The rule would rescind exemptions from CFTC registration
for mutual funds that use derivatives tied to commodities. The
 National Futures Association , a Chicago-based nonprofit
regulator financed by the industry, sought the change to improve
protection of retail investors.  The  Investment Company Institute , a Washington-based trade
association that represents mutual funds, opposed the proposed
change in a letter last year and said the firms are already
subject to regulation by the  Securities and Exchange Commission .  To contact the reporter on this story:
