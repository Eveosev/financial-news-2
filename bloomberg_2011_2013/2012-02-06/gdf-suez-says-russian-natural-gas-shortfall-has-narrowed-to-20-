GDF Suez SA ,  Europe ’s biggest utility
by market value, said a shortfall in Russian natural-gas supplies
for the French market narrowed.  Deliveries were 20 percent lower than the level Russia was
supposed to deliver under long-term contracts, compared with 30
percent over the past weekend, Armelle Dillar, a spokeswoman for
the Paris-based utility, said by telephone.  OAO Gazprom , Russia’s gas-export monopoly and the world’s
biggest gas producer, lowered supplies last week amid a cold
wave that stretched nationwide and across Europe, boosting
demand for the fuel. Gazprom provides about 25 percent of
Europe’s gas.  GDF Suez (GSZ)  has made up for the shortfall with supplies from
other countries as well as what it already has in storage,
Dillar said.  The French former monopoly got 14 percent of its long-term
contract supply from  Russia  in 2010, compared with 21 percent
from  Norway , 13 percent from  Algeria  and 11 percent from the
Netherlands, according to the company’s latest annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
