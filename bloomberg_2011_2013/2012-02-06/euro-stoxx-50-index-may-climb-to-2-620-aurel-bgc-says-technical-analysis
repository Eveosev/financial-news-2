The  Euro Stoxx 50 Index  of the euro
region’s biggest companies may gain as much as 5 percent in
coming weeks after a consolidation period, according to a
technical analyst at Aurel-BGC.  “European indexes are in a rising wave,” Gerard Sagnier,
a technical analyst at Aurel, wrote in a report today. “Still,
the risk-rewards are diminishing as the target approaches. It’s
not yet time to sell, but instead to wait for any pullback to
make final purchases.”  The  Euro Stoxx 50  fell 0.8 percent to 2,494.92 at 12:03
p.m. in  London , trimming this year’s gain to 7.7 percent. The
gauge’s next resistance level is at 2,535, and -- after a period
of consolidation -- it may rise as high as 2,620, Sagnier wrote.
A decline below 2,290 would end the rally, according to the
analyst.  Sagnier said on Jan. 9 that the Euro Stoxx 50 must break
the 2,380 level by the end of the month to complete the third
part of an Elliott Wave pattern. In the first part of the wave,
the measure advanced from late September until Oct. 28. In the
second part, the index retreated until Nov. 25.  The Elliott Wave is based on a theory developed by the
accountant  Ralph Nelson Elliott  during the Great Depression and
says that prices move in a pattern of five steps followed by
three steps. It contends that trends don’t move in straight
lines and that they are prone to setbacks. In a five-wave move,
stocks fall in waves number two and four.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
