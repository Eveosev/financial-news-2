The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars held near the lowest level in six months, according
to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 69 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:26 a.m. in
 London , data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the lowest cost
since Aug. 5.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 59 basis
points less than Euribor, the narrowest gap since Sept. 5. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to lend to one
another was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps, held near 76 basis points, the lowest since Oct. 21.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank , placing 511 billion euros ($668 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB on Friday from 488 billion euros on Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
