Iran ’s central bank has opened an
account with India’s government-run UCO Bank to receive payment
for as much as 45 percent of its crude exports to the South
Asian nation in rupees, the  Financial Chronicle  newspaper
reported, citing unidentified officials.  The account may start operating in two months, the
newspaper said. It will amount to about $5.4 billion per year,

railways and infrastructure that aren’t under sanctions, Aman
Chadha, chairman of the Engineering Export Promotion Council of
