SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. said it
fixed a computer glitch that prevented customers from completing
deposits and withdrawals earlier today.  SMBC Nikko, the brokerage unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc. (8316) , resolved the problem at 2:52 p.m. local time, said
Kiyoo Kuniyoshi, a Tokyo-based spokesman. The glitch had
affected 2.5 million accounts since around 2 a.m., he said.  The Japanese brokerage is investigating the cause and
effect of the failure, Kuniyoshi said earlier today. Stocks
transactions werenâ€™t affected, he said.  Shares of Sumitomo Mitsui rose 1.6 percent to 2,517 yen at
the close of trading in  Tokyo . The benchmark Topix Index climbed
1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
