The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt rose, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 10
basis points to 557.5 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase
& Co. at 7:30 a.m. in London. An increase signals worsening
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was up 3.25 at 130.25 basis points. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers added 4.5 basis points to 198.5 and the
subordinated gauge was up six at 343.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
