China  has been researching the
introduction of high-yield bonds as it seeks to make lending
more transparent and reduce companies’ reliance on bank debt.  Authorities recently looked at small and medium-sized
companies in the eastern province of Zhejiang and sought ideas
from underwriters and investors, Zhou Yuanfan, vice president at
Pengyuan Credit Rating Co., one of the country’s official rating
firms, said today in a telephone interview, without giving the
source of his information.  “The management and issuance will adhere to market
principles,” Zhou said. The government “should reduce
restrictions on investors and cultivate more qualified
investors, and they should include high-net-worth individuals.”  Premier  Wen Jiabao  has pledged to support small companies,
and the government will ask banks to increase tolerance of bad
loans to these businesses, according to a statement posted on
the central government’s website Feb. 2, citing a State Council
meeting.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
