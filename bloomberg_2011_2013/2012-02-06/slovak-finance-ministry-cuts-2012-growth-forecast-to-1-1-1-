Slovakia’s  Finance Ministry  cut its
2012 economic  growth  forecast to 1.1 percent from 1.7 percent as
 Europe ’s debt crisis damps demand.  The Bratislava, Slovakia-based ministry said today in a
preliminary update of its economic outlook from November that
it’s keeping its 2013 and 2014 gross domestic product forecast
at 2.7 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.  Exports, the main driver of the east European country’s
growth, are set to slow in 2012 as the lingering debt crisis in
the euro region depresses demand, the ministry forecasts. At the
same time, domestic demand will be hurt by the government’s
austerity measures.  Even as the economy will expand at a slower pace than
predicted in the 2012 budget, the slowdown will not require
adoption of any fiscal measures after last year’s budget gap was
smaller than projected, the ministry said. The 2011  budget
deficit  probably reached 4.6 percent of GDP, compared with 4.9
percent of GDP targeted.  The ministry also revised its forecast for the average 2012
 inflation  rate to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent. Price growth
will slow to an average 2.3 percent in 2013 and 2014, according
to the forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
