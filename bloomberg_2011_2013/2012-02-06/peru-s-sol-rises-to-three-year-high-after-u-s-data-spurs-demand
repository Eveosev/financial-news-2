Peru ’s sol rose to its strongest in
more than three years after U.S. economic data boosted the
outlook for the global economy, spurring demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol was little changed at 2.6880 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:08 a.m. Lima time, from 2.6890 on Feb. 3, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The currency earlier touched
2.6870, the strongest since at least December 2008.  Investor appetite for riskier assets grew last week after
the U.S. jobless rate slid to the lowest level in three years.  “The jobless rate was much better than expected and gave
the market a boost,” said Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco
Internacional del Peru in  Lima . “There have been sales in the
forwards market from offshore investors of late, which has
increased local banks’ dollar holdings.”  Peru’s central bank bought $409 million in the  spot market 
last week to stem gains in the sol.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.64 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.12 centimo to
114.68 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
