Sysco Corp ., the biggest North
American distributor of food to restaurants, fell the most in
more than five months after second-quarter earnings trailed
analysts’ estimates. The Houston-based company said rising food
costs squeezed profit margins.  Sysco dropped 3.6 percent to $29.79 at the close in New
York for the steepest decline  since Aug. 15  after reporting
earnings of 43 cents a share for the period ended Dec. 31,
missing the 44-cent  estimate  in a Bloomberg analyst survey.  Prices for meat, canned, dry and frozen food products
during the period “remained at historically high levels,”
Chief Executive Officer Bill DeLaney said in a statement. Food-
cost inflation was 6.3 percent, up from 4.5 percent a year
earlier, he said.  “We are currently developing several key strategic
initiatives that will better position Sysco to profitably grow
our market share in the years to come,” Delaney said in a
conference call with investors and analysts. The company is
undergoing a transformation that includes business-managment
software implementation, he said.  Net income fell 3.2 percent to $250 million from a year
earlier. Sales rose 9.2 percent to $10.2 billion, topping the
average estimate of $10.04 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
