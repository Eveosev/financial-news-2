Norway ’s agency for economic crime
said it fined units of  Transocean  Ltd. for underreporting
taxable income in 2001 and 2002.  The government in Oslo will seek 1.8 billion kroner ($310
million) in back taxes from Transocean and former employees of
accounting firm Ernst & Young and Norwegian law-firm Thommessen,
the Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and
Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime said today in an
e-mailed statement.  Transocean, which operates offshore oil rigs, said that the
compensation claims “are without merit,” according to a
statement issued by its attorneys in Norway. “We intend to
vigorously contest any assertions by the Norwegian civil and
criminal authorities in connection with the various transactions
being investigated,” said Hanne Skaarberg Holen, a partner at
PwC, in a statement.  Transocean, which is based in  Switzerland , also said it
“should be noted that the compensation claim directly overlaps
with the ongoing civil tax disputes and does not represent
any additional financial exposure to the Transocean group of
companies,” according to the statement.  Roar Valderhaug, a spokesman for Ernst & Young Norway, said
the company had “no comment, since we’re not party to the
case.” Kai Thoegersen, Thommessen’s managing partner, didn’t
respond to an e-mail seeking a comment and couldn’t immediately
be reached by telephone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
