Sukhoi Co. is offering its SuperJet
100 to JAT Airways,  Serbia ’s state-owned flag carrier which the
government wants to overhaul after a failed sale,  Blic  newspaper
reported, citing an unidentified person.  Two to four such aircraft might be added to JAT’s fleet
after half of it is retired following work to turn the
unprofitable airline into a smaller, regional carrier, according
to the report. The jet plane, developed with Italian
 Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) ’s Alenia Aeronautica, will be presented to
Serbian officials in Belgrade “soon,” Blic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
