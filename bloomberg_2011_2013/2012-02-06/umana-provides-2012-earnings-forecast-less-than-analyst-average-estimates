Humana Inc. , the second-largest
Medicare provider, raised its 2012 earnings forecast less than
analysts estimated as more Americans were expected to seek
medical care in a recovering economy.  Humana said 2012 profit may be $7.50 to $7.70 a share,
compared with the analysts’ average estimate of $8.05. Fourth-
quarter earnings excluding one-time items were $1.12, the
Louisville, Kentucky-based insurer said in a statement today.
The result missed by 9 cents the average of 17 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  About 40,000 more Medicare Advantage members may be added
in 2012 than expected, Humana said. The jump may help offset an
anticipated gain in demand for medical services.  UnitedHealth
Group Inc. (UNH)  and  WellPoint Inc. , the largest health insurers, also
have predicted costs would rise, expecting Americans to return
to typical levels of medical spending.  Humana’s “guidance probably allows for higher medical
costs,” said Dave Shove, an analyst with Bank of Montreal in
 New York , in a telephone interview. “I expect that these
numbers are not as robust as many had hoped.”  Humana fell 5.4 percent to $85.25 at 4:15 p.m. New York
time. The shares have gained 41 percent in the last 12 months.  Looking to Expand  The previous 2012 profit forecast had been $7.40 to $7.60,
Humana said. Fourth-quarter net income surged 85 percent to $199
million, or $1.20 a share, from $107 million, or 57 cents, the
company said.  Humana is looking to expand in the U.S. government program
for the elderly and disabled as the health-care law puts
pressure on how much insurers can be reimbursed for care, Chief
Executive Officer Michael McCallister said last month.
Increasing the size of Humana’s Medicare business, which
generated 64 percent of 2010 revenue, would help with costs,
McCallister said.  Humana owns more than 300 clinics in 40 states after
acquiring Concentra Inc. in 2010 for $790 million. Under
McCallister, the company also has bought small insurance plans
to increase Humana’s reach in Medicare. UnitedHealth serves the
most Medicare members.  McCallister, Humana’s CEO since 2000, is planning to retire
in 2013. He will be replaced by Bruce Broussard, who is Humana’s
president and was previously CEO of McKesson Specialty Health, a
$9 billion subsidiary of McKesson Corp. formed in the merger of
McKesson Specialty and U.S. Oncology in December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
