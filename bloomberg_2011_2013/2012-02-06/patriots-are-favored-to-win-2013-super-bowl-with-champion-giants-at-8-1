The  New England Patriots  are the
oddsmakers’ early favorite to win next season’s Super Bowl, even
after coming up short against the  New York Giants  in last
night’s  National Football League  championship game.  The Patriots, who were beaten 21-17 in Indianapolis, are
listed as 5-1 favorites at the MGM Grand’s sports book in  Las
Vegas . The Giants don’t even have the best odds in their
division after winning their second Super Bowl in five seasons.  “I hope we do get back here again,” Patriots quarterback
 Tom Brady  said at a news conference. “I’ve been lucky enough to
play in this game five times in 10 years. I’d love to keep
coming back to this game and taking a shot.”  The  Green Bay Packers , who had a 15-1 record during the
regular season before losing to the Giants in the playoffs, are
the second favorite at 11-2, according to the MGM Grand.  The Pittsburgh Steelers and  Philadelphia Eagles  are listed
at 6-1, followed by the Giants at 8-1. The Giants finished ahead
of the Eagles this season to make the playoffs as the  National
Football Conference ’s East division winner.  The New Orleans Saints and San Francisco 49ers have 10-1
odds of winning the  Super Bowl , with the San Diego Chargers and
Houston Texans at 12-1, the MGM Grand said. The  New York Jets 
are tied for the 13th-best odds among 32 NFL teams at 20-1.  The Giants’ odds of winning the Super Bowl at the start of
the 2011 season were 25-1, tied for 11th in the league. The
Patriots were the pre-season favorites at 9-2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
