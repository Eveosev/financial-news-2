New York Knicks  forward Amar’e Stoudemire will miss tonight’s game against the  Utah Jazz  after
the death of his brother.  Stoudemire, 29, has taken a leave of absence from the
National Basketball Association team, Knicks spokesman Jonathan Supranowitz said today in an e-mail. The six-time All-Star’s 35-
year-old brother, Hazell Stoudemire, was killed this morning in
Lake Wales,  Florida , when his car collided with the rear of a
tractor trailer, according to the state Highway Patrol.  A native of Cypress Creek, Florida, Amar’e Stoudemire is
travelling to his home state to be with his family, Supranowitz
said. There is no word on when he will return to the Knicks.  Stoudemire is in his 10th NBA season and second with the
Knicks. His 18.2 points and 8.1 rebounds per game both rank
second on the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
