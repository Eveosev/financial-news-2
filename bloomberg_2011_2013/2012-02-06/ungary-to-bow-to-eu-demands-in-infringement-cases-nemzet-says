The Hungarian government will yield
to some European Union demands in infringement cases concerning
the data protection agency, the retirement of judges and the
central bank,  Magyar Nemzet  said, citing unidentified people
with knowledge of the issue.  The Cabinet of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  will redraft a
law on the data protection agency stripping the premier of the
right to dismiss the head of the agency, the Budapest-based
daily said.  The government will offer “several concession” concerning
the forced early retirement of judges, including the possibility
to assess individual judges on a case by case basis, the
newspaper said.  Orban is ready to change the central bank law criticized by
the EU on several points, however, he will stick to central bank
officials having to take an oath of office as well as a cap on
their salaries, Nemzet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
