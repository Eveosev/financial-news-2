Hawaiian Telcom Holdco Inc (HCOM) ., a long-
distance telephone and Internet access provider, will host a
lender call tomorrow to discuss a $300 million loan to refinance
debt, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.  Credit Suisse AG is arranging the five-year transaction,
which pays interest at 5.75 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate, said the person, who declined to
be identified because the terms are private. The lending
benchmark will have a 1.25 percent floor, the person said.  Hawaiian Telcom may sell the debt at 98.5 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the borrower and
boosting the yield for investors.  In July, the Honolulu-based company pulled a planned
refinancing because of market conditions, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The debt would have refinanced $330
million in loans the company used to finance its exit from
bankruptcy in 2010.  “The credit markets appear to have improved and we believe
conditions now are favorable for us to pursue refinancing of our
existing credit facility under improved terms,” Eric Yeaman,
Hawaiian Telcom’s chief executive officer, said today in a
statement.  Lenders will receive soft-call protection of 102 cents and
101 cents, the person said, meaning Hawaiian Telcom would have
to pay two cents more than face value to reprice the debt in its
first year and one cent more than face value in its second year.  Lenders must submit commitments by Feb. 22, the person
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
