Ethanol futures rose in  Chicago ,
following an increase in gasoline prices.  Ethanol was the third-worst performing energy commodity in
2011, behind natural gas and coal. Stockpiles of the fuel
additive gained 5.8 percent to 20.9 million barrels the week
ended Jan. 27, the highest level since the Energy Department
began keeping weekly records in June 2010. Production rose to
939,000 barrels a day, the first advance this year.  “Earlier last week we saw a massive sell-off of ethanol
prices and it’s a bit of a technical rebound,” said  Terry Reilly , an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery climbed 2 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.193 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest level since Jan. 27.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  rose 1.5 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.20 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive fell 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.20, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “What you saw across the board was a spread-correction
day,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.  Ethanol in Chicago rose 0.75 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.125 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel retreated 1
cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.225.  Gasoline for March delivery rose 1.35 cents to $2.9279 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract
includes reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for March delivery declined 0.25 cent to $6.4425 a
bushel in Chicago. One such unit makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
