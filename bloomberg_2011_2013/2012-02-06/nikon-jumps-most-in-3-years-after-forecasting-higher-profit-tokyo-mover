Nikon Corp. (7731)  surged the most in three
years in Tokyo trading after the world’s second-biggest maker of
professional-grade cameras raised its operating profit forecast
on higher-than-expected sales.  The shares rose as much as 13 percent, the biggest intraday
advance since January 2009, to 2,098 yen and traded at 2,051 yen
at the 11:30 a.m. midday break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Operating profit will probably be 72 billion yen ($939
million) in the year ending March 31, 7.5 percent more than the
company’s previous estimate, it said in a statement after the
market closed on Feb. 3. Nikon, which began offering its first
mirrorless single-lens reflex camera in October, may sell 17
million digital cameras this fiscal year, 6.3 percent more than
its earlier estimate, it said.  “Mirrorless cameras are gaining recognition rapidly in
 Europe  and the U.S.,” Tetsuya Wadaki, an analyst at Nomura
Holdings Inc., said in a report to clients on Feb. 3. “Nikon
will remain a key player in the overseas digital camera market,
as the company has a lead over rivals in Europe and the U.S.”  Mirrorless models, which are more compact than traditional
single-lens reflex cameras, account for as much as 20 percent of
the segment, according to Wadaki. He raised his  rating  on the
stock to “buy” from “neutral” and boosted his 12-month
share-price estimate 29 percent to 2,159 yen.  Nikon kept its full-year estimate for net income to double
to 55 billion yen.  The camera and precision equipment maker resumed production
in  Thailand  in January, earlier than planned, as it started to
recover from the Southeast Asian nation’s worst floods in 70
years.  Canon Inc. (7751) , Nikon’s bigger rival in cameras, forecast
profit will increase by less than 1 percent to 250 billion yen
this year, the company said Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
