Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  will discontinue
its First Quotation Board and tighten the rules of its Entry
Standard segment to fight “massive and frequent suspected cases
of market manipulation.”  The operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange will end the
segment where 448 stocks are listed in the third quarter,
Laeticia Adam, a spokeswoman for  Deutsche Boerse (DB1) , said.
Companies affected can switch to the more highly regulated Prime
Standard and General Standard segments should they fulfill the
requirements, move to the Entry Standard segment, or lose their
listing, she said.  The segment, introduced in 2008, tightened rules a year
ago, while the measures failed to constrain the number of
suspected manipulations. Since December, it accepted no more new
listings.  “The measures will protect and further improve
transparency, quality and efficiency of the overall market,”
Alexander Hoeptner, who is responsible for the Market Services
Department at  Deutsche Boerse , said in a statement.  The group also plans to tighten the listing rules for the
Entry Standard segment. The current Second Quotation Board,
hosting almost 10,000 companies that have their first listing at
another exchange, will be renamed Quotation Board, Adam said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
