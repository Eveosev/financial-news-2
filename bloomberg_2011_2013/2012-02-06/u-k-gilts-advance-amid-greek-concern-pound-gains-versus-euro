(Corrects maturity of bills in final paragraph.)  U.K. 10-year gilts rose, with yields
falling the most in a week, as speculation that  Greece ’s efforts
to win a second aid package are faltering boosted demand for
safer assets.  The pound strengthened for the first time in four days
against the euro after euro-area finance chiefs told Greek
Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos on the weekend that an
increase in the bailout package wasn’t forthcoming. Gilts
underperformed German bunds for a fourth day after traders
reduced bets on the size of asset purchases the Bank of England
may adopt when policy makers meet this week.  “It’s a global risk-off day,” said Vatsala Datta, an
interest-rate strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in
London. “Gilts are following bunds, and slightly
underperforming because of the nervousness ahead of the
quantitative-easing” decision.  The 10-year gilt yield fell four basis points to 2.14
percent at 1:22 p.m.  London  time after dropping as much as six
basis points, the most since Jan. 30. The 3.75 percent bond due
September 2021 rose 0.355, or 3.55 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,576) face amount to 113.88.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened to 25 basis
points from 18 basis points at the end of last month.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  met German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  in Paris today as Greece’s prime minister,  Lucas Papademos  and chiefs of the three parties supporting him sought
to find consensus in  Athens . “Time is running out,” Merkel
said in a joint briefing with Sarkozy.  Positive Return  Gilts have handed investors a return of 18 percent over the
past year as the European debt crisis worsened, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds rose 11 percent.  The gain in gilts was tempered by speculation the  Bank of
England  will announce fewer debt purchases than some analysts
predicted when it meets Feb. 9  The Monetary Policy Committee raised the ceiling on the
central bank’s bond purchases to 275 billion pounds in October,
starting a round of buying that ended on Feb. 2. Policy makers
will boost the program to 325 billion pounds this week,
according to 34 of 50 economists in a Bloomberg News  survey .
Fifteen forecast a 75 billion-pound increase, and one no change.  Deutsche Bank AG lowered its estimate to 50 billion pounds
from 75 billion pounds on Feb. 3 after surveys showed services
and manufacturing activity improved.  House Prices  U.K.  house prices  rose for the first time in three months
in January, Halifax said today. Prices increased 0.6 percent
from December, the mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc
said. From a year earlier, they dropped 1.7 percent.  The pound appreciated 0.5 percent to 82.78 pence per euro,
and dropped 0.4 percent to $1.5757.  Sterling has weakened 0.8 percent this year according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar fell 2.4 percent, and
the euro dropped 1.6 percent.  The pound may decline more than 3.5 percent against the
dollar over the next month should it fall below a level of
support, Societe Generale SA said, citing trading patterns. The
currency may drop to $1.5170 after failing to advance through a
level of resistance at $1.5885, technical strategists Hugues Naka and Fabien Manac’h wrote.  Gilts have lost 0.2 percent this year after volatility was
taken into account, according to Bloomberg risk-adjusted return
rankings. The risk-adjusted return is calculated by dividing
total return by volatility, or the degree of daily price-swing
variation, giving a measure of income per unit of risk. The
returns are not annualized.  The U.K. plans to auction 4 billion pounds of bonds due
2017 tomorrow, as well as 3.5 billion pounds of 28-, 91- and
182-day bills on Feb. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
