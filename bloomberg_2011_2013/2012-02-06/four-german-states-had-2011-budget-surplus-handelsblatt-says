Just four of  Germany ’s 16 states
showed a  budget surplus  last year even as pressure rises on
regional governments to cut spending to fulfill constitutional
“debt brake” constraints, the  Handelsblatt  reported.  Bavaria, Brandenburg, Saxony and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania
had surpluses while the country’s most populous state, North-
Rhine Westphalia, had the biggest deficit at 2.9 billion euros
($3.8 billion), the newspaper said.  Since 2010, the federal government and states have pledged
to rein in spending to achieve a balanced budget of their
composite accounts by 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
