The Rhine River,  Europe ’s busiest
inland waterway, is still fully navigable to barge traffic with
falling water levels and recent colder weather having little
impact on fuel shipments.  “There is no ice on the river and ships are able to fully
load up to a depth of around three meters,” Michael Goike,
nautical shift leader at Wasser- und Schifffahrtsverwaltung in
Germany, said by telephone today.  In Kaub, a potential bottleneck 40 miles west of  Frankfurt ,
the barge clearance level dropped to 245 centimeters on Feb. 2,
data from the German Federal Institute of Hydrology show. That
marked a ninth consecutive daily drop, according to the data.  Barge freight rates  have increased by 50 euro cents (65
cents) on Feb. 3 to 7 euros a metric ton for fuel shipments from
Rotterdam to Cologne, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Germany ’s Mittelland canal will close later today, making
barge shipments no longer possible between the Rhine and the
cities of Hamburg and Berlin.  The link will close at 6:20 p.m. local time, Volker Klose,
an official at the Wasser- und Schiffahrtsverwaltung said from
Hanover.  To contact the reporter on this story:
