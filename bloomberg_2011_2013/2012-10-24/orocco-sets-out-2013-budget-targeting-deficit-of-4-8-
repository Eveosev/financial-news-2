Morocco ’s Finance Minister Nizar Baraka introduced a 2013 budget that set spending at 298 billion
dirhams ($34.7 billion) and targeted a deficit of about 5
percent, as the North African country looks to stave off unrest
that has rocked other Arab nations.  Revenue for 2013 was projected at 283 billion dirhams under
the budget put to parliament today. The government will continue
spending heavily on energy and staple subsidies, estimating
expenditure to be between 45.9 billion and 49.3 billion dirhams.
In 2012, the total spending on subsidies may total 53 billion
dirhams. Economic growth was forecast at 4.5 percent in 2013.  “The restoration of a balanced budget is possible by
optimizing the costs and improving the revenue,” Baraka told
parliament.  Last year, the country’s budget deficit widened as the
government boosted spending in an attempt to curtail economic
challenges that helped spark uprisings elsewhere in the Arab
world. The nation faces growing problems after a drought hit its
harvest and amid concerns about the economic fallout from the
euro-region crisis.  Europe  is Morocco’s biggest export market
and the source of almost two-thirds of its tourists.  “Moroccan authorities are finding it more challenging to
reduce the vulnerabilities created by the twin deficits in the
context of a difficult external environment while maintaining
Morocco’s traditional political and social stability,” ratings
agency  Standard & Poor’s  said on Oct. 11 as it revised its
outlook for the country’s debt to negative from stable.  Coalition parties that won last November’s elections, led
by the Islamist Justice and Development party, raised taxes on
alcohol in April for the first time since 2010 by 12 percent for
beer and 43 percent on other alcoholic beverages. In June 2011,
Morocco raised fuel prices by about 20 percent to cut spending
on subsidies.  The 2013 budget was based on an oil price of $105 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
