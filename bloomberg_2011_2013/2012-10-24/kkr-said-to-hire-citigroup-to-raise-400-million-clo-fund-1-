KKR & Co. (KKR) , the New York-based
private-equity firm run by Henry Kravis and  George Roberts ,
hired  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to raise a $400 million collateralized loan
obligation, according to two people with knowledge of the
transaction.  The CLO will be called KKR Financial CLO 2012-1, said one
of the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal
is private. Scott Helfman, a spokesman for Citigroup, and Kristi
Huller, a spokeswoman for KKR, declined to comment.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. this month raised its 2013 forecast
for new CLOs, which help finance leveraged buyouts, to a range
of $60 billion to $70 billion. The bank previously projected new
issuance of CLOs backed by widely syndicated loans would be $50
billion to $60 billion next year. The lender is expecting $45
billion for 2012.  KKR raised a $400 million collateralized loan obligation
last year that was later increased to $600 million. The fund was
privately negotiated with an undisclosed third-party senior
lender,  KKR Financial Holdings LLC (KFN)  said in July 2011.  KKR Financial, based in San Francisco, is the publicly
traded credit business of KKR.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
