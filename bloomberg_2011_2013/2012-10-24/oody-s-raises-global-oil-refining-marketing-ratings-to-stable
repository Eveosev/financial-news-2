Moody’s Investors Services, the
U.S.-based credit agency, boosted its outlook for the global
independent refining and marketing industry to stable from
negative.  “Worldwide growth in demand for refined products will slow
through 2013,” Gretchen French, a vice president of the ratings
agency in  New York , said today in an e-mailed statement. “We
expect modest growth in the U.S., but also see weakness in
 Europe  and economic slowing in  China .”  The group will continue to face difficulties from “long-
term secular decline” in demand for gasoline from countries in
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and as
a forecast increase in refining capacity outpaces growth in
consumption by 900,000 barrels a day next year, Moody’s said.  Since the start of last year at least seven sites have
closed in Europe and Petroplus Holdings AG, previously the
region’s largest independent refiner, filed for bankruptcy.  The increase in the rating is based on Moody’s view of the
fundamental credit conditions for the industry in the next year
to 18 months, it said, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
