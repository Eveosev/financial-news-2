Apple Inc. (AAPL)  lost a Dutch court ruling
in a patent lawsuit over  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ’s Galaxy
handsets.  Samsung’s Galaxy products using certain versions of  Google
Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system don’t infringe Apple patents
concerning so-called multi-touch flags, Judge Peter Blok said in
a ruling today in The Hague, Netherlands. Apple claims Galaxy
smartphones and tablets infringe a patent for technology that
interprets finger activity on touch screens.  The ruling is the latest in a long line of disputes in
courts across the globe as rivals including  HTC Corp. (2498) , Apple and
Samsung fight for dominance in the smart phone and tablet-
computer markets. The Hague-based court said today’s verdict
follows similar rulings in the U.K. and Germany on the touch-
screen patents.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, was also ordered to
pay Samsung about 325,000 euros ($420,000) in costs, the judge
said.  Steve Park , a spokesman for Apple in Seoul, declined to
comment.  The court started a new round of trials between Apple and
Samsung in the Netherlands in September, concerning multiple
patents and proceedings as Apple seeks a ban on Galaxy devices
in the country, where the Suwon, South Korea-based company has
its distribution center for Europe. The companies compete in a
global smart phone market that grew 62 percent to $219 billion
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
