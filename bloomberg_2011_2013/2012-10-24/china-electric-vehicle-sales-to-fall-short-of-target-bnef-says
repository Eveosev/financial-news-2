China ’s electric vehicle sales
probably will fall short of the government’s target because the
vehicles are costly and lack charging infrastructure, Bloomberg
New Energy Finance said in a research note.  Sales in China’s market totaled about 13,000 vehicles from
2009 to 2011, and figures for 2012 are “not expected to be
orders of magnitude higher,” the London-based researcher said
in a statement released today.  The government aims to have 500,000 cumulative sales by
2015 and 5 million by 2020. Those targets were outlined in the
New Energy Vehicle Industrial Plan for 2012 to 2020 released in
July, part of an effort to cut pollution and help the Chinese
auto industry catch up with foreign competitors, New Energy
Finance said.  “China is making a big bet on electric vehicles, but it
will need to bring in expertise and technology from foreign
players to create competitive vehicles, and to deploy the full
muscle of its  auto industry  in order to produce vehicles the
public trusts,” said  Michael Liebreich , chief executive officer
of New Energy Finance.  “If it does this, we could well see sales in 2020 creeping
closer to the target and China playing a leading international
role,” he said. “But the chances of China going it alone in
electric vehicle, and as a result leapfrogging the world’s auto
majors, are looking very slim.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
