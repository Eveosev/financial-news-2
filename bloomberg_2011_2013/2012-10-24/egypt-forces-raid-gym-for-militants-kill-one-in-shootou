A suspected militant detonated an
explosive before being shot dead by Egyptian security forces
during a raid on a Cairo neighbourhood gym, officials said.  The man was killed as authorities raided the facility which
was being used as a hideout, the Cairo Security Directorate said
in an e-mailed statement today. The suspect detonated an
explosive device in the gym, setting fire to several other
apartments in the building, it said.  Security forces found various weapons on the premises,
including 17 hand grenades, four rocket-propelled grenade
launchers and three automatic rifles, the directorate said.  Authorities have been striking hard at suspected militants
after an August attack in Sinai, near the border with Gaza, left
16 border guards dead.  Earlier today, the  Interior Ministry  said in a statement it
intercepted a weapons shipment believed to be from  Libya  that
included 24 rockets, each more than five meters long, as well as
two short-range rockets and 102 rocket-propelled grenades.
Authorities also found 19 medium-sized barrels laden with
explosive compounds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
