Atlas Copco AB (ATCOA) , the world’s largest
maker of air compressors, reported profit that beat analysts’
estimates as North American industrial demand “remained
healthy,” sending its shares up the most in almost four months.  Third-quarter net income fell to 3.48 billion kronor ($520
million) from 3.6 billion kronor a year earlier, the Stockholm-
based company said today in a statement. That exceeded the
average estimate of 3.42 billion kronor in a Bloomberg  survey  of
16 analysts.  “We are pleased with the profitability we have achieved
and with how sales developed considering the mixed market
conditions,” Chief Executive Officer Ronnie Leten said in a
separate release.  Atlas Copco, which benefits when metals prices are high
because miners buy more rock drills and blast-hole rigs, said
near-term demand “is expected to decrease somewhat.”  New
orders rose 1.1 percent to 21.4 billion kronor in the quarter.
Leten said Atlas would continue to put a “strong focus” on cost
control and that the company will adapt capacity if necessary.  Atlas Copco  rose  as much as 7.8 kronor, or 5.2 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since June 29, and traded up 4.6 percent
at 158 kronor as of 12:27 in the Swedish capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
