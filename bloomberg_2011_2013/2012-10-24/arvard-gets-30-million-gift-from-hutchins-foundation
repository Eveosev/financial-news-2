Harvard University  received a $30
million gift from the Hutchins Family Foundation to support
initiatives of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and renewal of
its House system for undergraduates.  The foundation, endowed by  Glenn Hutchins , co-founder of
technology-focused private equity firm  Silver Lake , will award
matching gifts to donors interested in revitalizing the Houses,
where 98 percent of undergraduates live, Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Harvard said today in a  statement .  “This extraordinarily generous gift exemplifies Glenn’s
leadership and dedication to Harvard,” President Drew Faust
said today in the statement. “Because of his efforts to create
this challenge fund, we are another step closer to strengthening
one of our most cherished traditions.”  Harvard College ’s House system, developed in the 1920s,
includes 12 buildings where students live along with a faculty
member and staff of graduate students. When alumni of the
college meet for the first time, “the first question they ask
is not ‘which year?’ but rather, ‘which House?’” Hutchins, 57, 
said in the statement.  Hutchins, a former resident of Winthrop House, received an
undergraduate degree from Harvard in 1977, as well as an MBA and 
law degree in 1983. He also serves as a director at  Harvard 
Management Co.  and the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
