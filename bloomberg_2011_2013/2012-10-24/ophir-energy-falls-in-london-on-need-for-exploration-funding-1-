Ophir Energy Plc (OPHR) , a U.K. explorer
focusing on  Africa , tumbled the most in almost three months in
 London  trading because it needs cash for projects next year.  Ophir fell 5.2 percent to 551 pence, the biggest drop since
Aug. 2. The company yesterday made a  presentation  to investors
announcing plans to drill 15 wells next year. It plans to invest
$650 million in projects, from $398 million expected this year.  The “biggest negative surprise: The size of 2013’s cash
requirement, largely driven by bigger-than-expected program in
Equatorial Guinea,” Laura Loppacher, an analyst at Jefferies
International Ltd., said in a note. “With $200 million forecast
year-end cash, this leaves them $450 million short.”  Chief Financial Officer Lisa Mitchell said yesterday the
company plans to fill the gap by selling stakes in its fields as
Ophir has received numerous offers without yet accepting any.  The company, based in London, said yesterday it may build a
liquefied natural-gas plant in  Equatorial Guinea . It also plans
to explore and appraise fields in Tanzania, Gabon and Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
