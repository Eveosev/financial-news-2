South Africa’s  Competition
Commission  has recommended the maximum penalty in a price-fixing
case spanning decades that involves six companies including
 Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Total SA. (FP)   The regulator, which has referred the matter to the
Competition Tribunal for adjudication, wants the companies to be
fined 10 percent of their revenues in the preceding financial
year, it said in a statement today.  The investigation “revealed collusive conduct through
extensive exchanges of commercially sensitive information by the
respondent  oil companies ,” which also include  Engen (ENGN)  Ltd.,  Sasol
Ltd. (SOL) , BP SA and the South African Petroleum Industry
Association, or Sapia, the Pretoria-based commission said.  The companies exchanged detailed sales volumes of gasoline,
diesel and other fuels, allowing them to “align their
strategies in the market,” according to the statement. High
profit margins were maintained through the sharing of
information that started in the late 1980s and largely went
through through Sapia from 2005, the investigation found.  The referral is confined to the production, marketing and
distribution of diesel and commercial sales of the fuel. The
commission is still investigating the respondents in other
product categories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
