Japan  will restrict rice shipments
from an area in Fukushima prefecture after a sample exceeded a
new government safety standard for the first time since a
stricter level was imposed, rekindling food-safety concerns.  The restriction will be imposed on the Nishifukuro area in
Sukagawa city, where grain containing 110 becquerels of
radioactive cesium per kilogram was found, said Tomoyuki Araki
at the grain division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries. The limit is 100 becquerels.  Officials are testing all rice in Fukushima for radioactive
contamination after last year’s earthquake and tsunami crippled
a nuclear plant in the prefecture, contaminating products from
vegetables to milk and beef. Shipments will be allowed to resume
after confirming the safety of about 12 million bags of rice
produced in the prefecture, said Wataru Amano at the agriculture
department of the Fukushima government office.  “The restriction won’t have a major impact on rice supply
as the affected area represents less than 1 percent of total
rice planted in Fukushima prefecture,” Amano said by phone.  Fukushima was the seventh-largest rice producer in Japan
last year, representing 4.3 percent of the nation’s harvest,
according to the agriculture ministry.  Rice production in Fukushima slumped 20 percent to 351,900
metric tons last year as the government restricted planting of
the grain because of radioactive fallout from the nuclear plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
