Oil in  New York  traded near the
lowest close since July after U.S. inventories rose more than
forecast and fuel demand dropped.  Prices were little changed after five days of losses, the
longest decline in five months. The Energy Department said  crude
stockpiles  jumped 5.9 million barrels last week, more than three
times the median 1.8 million gain forecast by analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline demand  fell to a seven-month low,
and the  Federal Reserve  said unemployment remains elevated.  “Inventory data overnight was a lot more bearish than
expected,” said  Michael McCarthy , a chief market strategist at
CMC Markets in Sydney. The Fed’s comments “added to a general
risk-off tone to the markets overnight,” he said.  Crude for December delivery was at $86.05 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , up 32
cents, at 1:30 p.m. Singapore time. The contract settled at
$85.73 yesterday, the lowest since July 10. Prices are down 13
percent this year.  Brent oil for December settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was at $108.12 a barrel, up 27 cents.
The European benchmark crude was at a premium of $22.05 to New
York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade, from $22.12 yesterday.  U.S. crude stockpiles increased to 375.1 million barrels in
the week ended Oct. 19, the highest for this time of year since
the government started reporting inventories in 1982. Supplies
at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for the WTI contract,
rose by 40,000 barrels to 44.1 million, 40 percent more than a
year ago.  Crude Output  Production in the U.S. climbed for a seventh week to 6.61
million barrels a day, a 17-year high. Imports gained for a
fourth week, up 5.7 percent at 8.82 million barrels a day.
Refinery utilization averaged 87.2 percent of capacity, from
87.4 percent.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose 1.44 million barrels to 198.6
million last week, according to the Energy Department. Supplies
were forecast to increase by 500,000 barrels. Distillate fuels,
which include heating oil and diesel, slid 646,000 barrels to
118 million. They were expected to drop 1.2 million.  Gasoline consumption  declined 2.7 percent to 8.49 million
barrels a day, the slowest rate since March 16. The  four-week
average  fell to 8.61 million, a six-month low.  Gasoline for November delivery in New York decreased for a
10th day yesterday, capping the longest losing streak since
futures began trading in May 1986. The contract was 0.3 percent
higher at $2.61 a gallon today.  Keystone Pipeline  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  took pressure restrictions off its
590,000 barrel-a-day Keystone oil pipeline, according to James
Millar, a company spokesman. The pipe runs 2,150 miles (3,459
kilometers) from Hardisty,  Alberta , to Wood River and Patoka,
 Illinois , and to the storage hub at Cushing. It was shut Oct. 17
for repairs.  The Fed said yesterday it would maintain $40 billion in
monthly purchases of mortgage-backed securities aimed at
speeding economic growth.  “Strains in global financial markets continue to pose
significant downside risks,” the  Federal Open Market Committee 
said at the conclusion of a two-day meeting in  Washington . The
central bank repeated that  interest rates  are likely to stay
near zero “at least through mid-2015.”  Hurricane Sandy, which closed businesses and airports in
 Jamaica  as it moved north in the Caribbean, was due to approach
the U.S. East Coast next week, avoiding the  Gulf of Mexico . The
Gulf is home to 23 percent of U.S. oil production, 7 percent of
natural-gas output and 44 percent of refining capacity,
according to the Energy Department.  Oil’s decline in New York is slowing as a technical
indicator shows futures have fallen too far for further losses
to be sustainable, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
14-day relative strength index yesterday dropped to 31.6, the
lowest since June 28. Crude rebounded from a nine-month low in
June when the RSI slid below 30, signaling the market was
oversold. Today’s reading is 32.8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
