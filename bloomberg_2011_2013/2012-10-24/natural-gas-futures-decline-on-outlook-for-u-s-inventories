Natural gas futures dropped in  New
York  for the second time in three days on speculation that
government data will show a bigger-than-normal stockpile
increase for last week.  Gas slid as much as 2.6 percent. An Energy Department
report scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington  may say inventories expanded by 67 billion cubic feet
in the seven days ended Oct. 19 to 3.843 trillion, according to
the median of 16 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
five-year average gain for the week is 65 billion.  “The expectations for a larger storage injection are
putting downward pressure on prices,” said Tom Saal, senior
vice president of energy trading at INTL Hencorp Futures LLC in
Miami. “There are indications that the market wants to continue
to move lower.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 7.1 cents, or 2
percent, to $3.464 per million British thermal units at 11:15
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures are down
3.9 percent from a year ago. Gas advanced to $3.648 per million
Btu on Oct. 22, the highest intraday price since Dec. 2.  February $5.50 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 0.1 cent lower at 1.5 cents on
volume of 1,090 contracts as of 11:16 a.m. Calls accounted for
55 percent of options volume.  Inventories may climb to a record 3.903 trillion cubic feet
by Oct. 31, the Energy Department said Oct. 10 in its monthly
Short-Term Energy Outlook.  2012 Output  U.S. natural gas production in 2012 will average 68.85
billion cubic feet a day, up 4 percent from last year and an
all-time high, the department said.  Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s largest natural gas producer, said
it began resuming production at shut-in wells in August and
volumes are “now largely restored.”  The company affirmed its 2012 production guidance of 3
billion cubic feet a day, according to a statement today. Encana
had been curtailing output because of low prices.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
rose by five to 427 last week, according to data released Oct.
19 by  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  in Houston. The rig count is down 47
percent this year.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first six months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  Mild Weather  MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted
mostly warmer-than-normal weather in the eastern U.S. through
Oct. 28.  The low in New York on Oct. 26 may be 58 degrees Fahrenheit
(14 Celsius), 11 above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
 State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Boston  may be 50
degrees, 7 more than the usual reading.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Department.  A lack of Pacific Ocean warming and of blocking patterns in
the Atlantic will probably mean warmer-than-normal weather in
the eastern U.S. for the next three months, said  Todd Crawford ,
chief meteorologist at Weather Services International.  Temperatures in the East may be about 2 degrees Fahrenheit
(1 Celsius) above normal from November through January, while
the Northwest cools, according to a seasonal forecast Oct. 22
from the Andover, Massachusetts-based company.  Natural  gas prices  may “pause” in the absence of a cold
winter, Arun Jayaram, an analyst at Credit Suisse AG in New
York, said in a note to clients today.  Stronger-than-forecast production from the Haynesville
shale formation, drilling efficiencies and a surge in output
from the Marcellus reservoir may prevent price gains, Jayaram
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
