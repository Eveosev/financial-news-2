Light Louisiana Sweet and other U.S.
Gulf of Mexico oils gained on the  spot market  as Brent’s premium
over West Texas Intermediate grew, increasing the cost of
waterborne imports.  Brent, the global benchmark crude, rose 54 cents to $22.12
a barrel over the U.S. benchmark, a one-week high. When Brent’s
premium to WTI increases, the cost of alternatives such as Gulf
crudes tend to rise, as well.  Light Louisiana Sweet increased 35 cents to $22.10 over WTI
at 4:13 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained 30 cents to a $21.10
premium.  Medium-density, high-sulfur grades from the Gulf also rose.
Mars Blend’s premium gained 50 cents to $15 a barrel. Poseidon
gained 50 cents to $14.25 over WTI. Southern Green Canyon added
50 cents to bring its premium to $13.  Thunder Horse  increased 50
cents to an $18.50 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
