National Football League officials will use pink penalty flags during the  New York Jets ’ game against the  Miami Dolphins  this week after a New Jersey fifth- grader made the recommendation to Commissioner  Roger Goodell .  The NFL has been recognizing October as Breast Cancer Awareness month, with players wearing pink equipment including cleats, socks, wristbands and gloves. Coaches, cheerleaders and officials also have used pink accessories.  Dante Cano, an 11-year-old from Marlboro, New Jersey, wrote to Goodell suggesting that league officials throw pink flags following on-field penalties instead of the standard yellow, NFL spokesman Dan Masonson said in a telephone interview.  Goodell invited Cano to the Oct. 28 game between the Jets and Dolphins at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, where he’ll present the pink flags to the officials prior to kickoff.  “Sometimes the simplest ideas can be the best,” Goodell said in an e-mailed statement. “I applaud Dante for sending in his recommendation.”  The NFL said its fourth annual campaign helps remind women 40 and older about the importance of having an annual mammogram and has raised more than $3 million for the  American Cancer Society , with the majority of the donation raised through the sale of pink items.
