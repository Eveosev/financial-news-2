Renewable Energy Corp. (REC) , the
Norwegian solar-energy company, reported a profit in the third
quarter after the bankruptcy of its Norwegian REC Wafer unit
allowed it to “derecognize” some liabilities.  The Sandvika-based company reported net income of 408
million kroner ($71 million), versus a loss of 759 million
kroner a year earlier, according to a statement released today.
The company reported an 860 million kroner profit from
discontinued operations, while continuing operation had a loss
of 452 million kroner.  REC said last week it expected results to miss analyst
estimates, with revenue from continuing operations at 1.5
billion kroner and a loss before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization of about 185 million kroner. It repeated those
figure today.  “REC continues to aggressively reduce costs and improve
our product quality, together with our partners we will weather
the current industry turmoil and capture the opportunities that
lie ahead,” said Chief Executive Officer Ole Enger.  The Norwegian company, just like European peers such as
 Solarworld AG (SWV) , is struggling with low prices after Chinese
competitors expanded just as demand slowed. Lower subsidies from
governments in France, Italy and  Germany  have reduced sales of
renewable energy components. REC shares fell to a record low
1.16 kroner yesterday, down from as high as 196 kroner in
November 2007.  REC has sought to boost its finances by reducing capacity,
shutting activity in  Norway . The company raised 1.3 billion
kroner through a share offer in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
