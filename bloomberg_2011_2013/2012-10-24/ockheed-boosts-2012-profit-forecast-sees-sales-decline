Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s
largest defense contractor, said third-quarter profit rose 9.3
percent and raised its full-year profit forecast. The company
also projected a decline in 2013 sales.  Net income from continuing operations for the quarter rose
to $727 million, or $2.21 a share, from $665 million, or $1.99 a
share, a year earlier, the company said today in a statement.
The  average estimate  of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a profit of $1.85 a share. Sales declined 2.1 percent to
$11.9 billion.  Full-year profit will be $8.20 to $8.40 a share compared
with the forecast of $7.90 to $8.10 a share made in July, the
Bethesda, Maryland-based company said. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast profit of $8.18 a share.  Robert Stevens, 61, the chairman and chief executive
officer, has spearheaded an industry effort to stave off U.S.
defense budget cuts of $500 billion over a decade under a
process called sequestration that would come on top of $487
billion the Pentagon already plans to cut from its proposed
budgets over that period.  Lockheed’s 2013 sales will decline “at a low single-digit
rate from 2012 levels” because of weak sales anticipated in its
Information Systems & Global Solutions unit, and is based “on
the assumption that sequestration does not occur,” the company
said in the statement today.  Layoff Notices  Earlier this month Lockheed dropped plans to issue layoff
notices to its employees after warning that it may have to fire
as many as 10,000 workers if the automatic budget cuts go into
effect in January.  The company changed its intention to issue notices after
the White House Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 29 said
the government will cover legal and compensation costs if
defense and domestic cuts take effect in January and contractors
are held liable in court for not giving enough notice under the
federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.  Lockheed decided not to issue layoff notices after the
Pentagon reassured the company that no contract disruptions
would occur on January 2 or for several months after as a result
of sequestration, Stevens told reporters today on a conference
call.  “We will comply with the law and issue WARN Act notices at
the appropriate time” if sequestration-related actions are
likely to affect the company’s contracts, Stevens said.  F-35 Pressure  Stevens has said he plans to retire as CEO in January to be
replaced by Chris Kubasik, 51, currently the president and chief
operating officer.  Lockheed fell less than 1 percent to $91.95 yesterday in
 New York  trading and has gained 13.7 percent this year.  Lockheed is under pressure as it negotiates a contract with
the Pentagon for the next lot of its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter,
the Pentagon’s single biggest weapons program. Officials
including Air Force Major General Christopher Bogdan, the deputy
program executive officer, have criticized the company for poor
relations, delays in software development and problems with
helmets worn by the plane’s pilots.  The company has received 75 percent of the funds toward
that fifth lot of F-35 trail production orders, pending
completion of contract talks, Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief
financial officer, told reporters today.  Lockheed has 94 F-35 jets on its production line from
various lots, and the lack of a completed contract for the fifth
lot won’t affect this year’s profit, Tanner said.  Unit Results  Initial production orders of F-35 jets during the quarter
valued at about $300 million partially offset lower sales
volumes from C-130 transports and F-16 fighters in the
Aeronautics unit, Lockheed said in the statement.  The unit’s sales fell 6.7 percent to $3.7 billion, and
profit fell 6.5 percent to $415 million.  Sales at the Electronic Systems unit, which makes anti-
missile systems and oversees the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship
program, rose 4.2 percent to $3.82 billion because of Aegis
radar and tactical missiles. Profit increased 13.9 percent to
$509 million, the company said.  Space Systems sales fell 4.9 percent to $2.06 billion
because of fewer commercial satellite deliveries, Lockheed said.
Unit profit rose 19.9 percent to $301 million.  Sales at the Information Systems & Global Solutions unit
fell 1.3 percent to $2.3 billion. Profit at the unit, which
provides information-technology services to U.S. agencies
including the Pentagon, fell 1.9 percent to $209 million.  Lockheed’s discontinued operations included the Pacific
Architects & Engineers unit that was sold in April 2011 and Savi
Technology Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
