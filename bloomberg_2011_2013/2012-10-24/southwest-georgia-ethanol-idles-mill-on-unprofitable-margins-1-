Southwest  Georgia  Ethanol idled its
plant in Camilla, Georgia, as higher corn prices made production
of the biofuel unprofitable.  The distillery has the capacity to produce 100 million
gallons of ethanol annually.  “We idled it due to the corn prices,” Murray Campbell,
the company’s president, said in a telephone interview. “We
hope to come back up sooner rather than later.”  Southwest Georgia’s move follows  Abengoa SA (ABG) ’s Oct. 1
decision to shut its Madison, Illinois, ethanol mill temporarily
because of poor margins after the worst U.S. drought in 56 years
scorched cornfields and raised production costs for the biofuel.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery declined 0.4 cent
to $2.402 a gallon today on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures
have gained 9 percent this year.  Corn for December delivery dropped 1.5 cents to $7.545 a
bushel in Chicago. The grain has risen 17 percent this year. One
bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol in the U.S.  Southwest Georgia has enough liquidity to cover expenses
until next year’s corn harvest “but will be ready to ramp up
production earlier, given the proper market opportunities,” it
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
