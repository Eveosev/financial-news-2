Ecuador ’s credit outlook was raised
to positive from stable by Fitch Ratings as higher than budgeted
prices for the OPEC nation’s oil boosted economic growth and
reduced the need to borrow.  Fitch said today in a statement that it affirmed the South
American country’s credit rating at B-, six levels below
investment grade. Ecuador, which defaulted on $3.2 billion of
its global bonds in 2008 and 2009, was raised by Fitch from CCC
in November 2010, Bloomberg data show. Fitch’s change in
Ecuador’s outlook follows upgrades from Moody’s Investors
Service in September and Standard & Poor’s in June.  Oil revenue is allowing the government to boost public
investment and limit borrowing, Fitch said. Crude oil prices
have averaged about $17 more a barrel than the country’s Finance
Ministry budgeted this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Ecuador’s ratings currently balance comparatively
stronger fiscal and external solvency indicators against the
sovereign’s weak debt service record, limited sources of
financing and high commodity dependence,” analyst Santiago
Mosquera wrote in the statement.  Ecuador’s gross domestic product grew 5.2 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, according to an Oct. 5
report from the central bank. Ecuador is the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries’ smallest member.  To contact the reporter on this story:
