UBS AG (UBSN)  is assisting the Australian
market regulator with an informal inquiry regarding a client
order placed on Oct. 18, Caroline Gurney, a Sydney-based
spokeswoman for the Swiss bank said.  Sudden gains in stocks such as  Australia  & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. and Brambles Ltd. at the open of Australia’s
main share market briefly added $10 billion to the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index on Oct. 18. The Australian Securities and
Investment Commission is examining the price spikes, spokesman
Andre Khoury said. The unusual moves were triggered by bids
being canceled seconds before trading began, two people familiar
with the investigation told Bloomberg last week.  Australia joined other countries experiencing market
disruption this year. Orders for Indian stocks improperly
entered by a Mumbai brokerage sent the S&P CNF Nifty Index down
16 percent in eight seconds on Oct. 5 before it rebounded. In
the U.S., Knight Capital Group Inc., one of the biggest market
makers, bombarded American exchanges with mistaken orders in the
first minutes of trading on Aug. 1. The company blamed the
mishap on defective software.  “We are proactively assisting ASIC and the matter is in
their hands,” Caroline Gurney, a Sydney-based spokeswoman for
UBS, said by telephone. “We’re confirming that it was a client
order,” she said, declining to comment on if and when it was
executed or whether the order moved prices.  Market Disruption  ASIC’s Khoury said the regulator is continuing to look into
the matter.  “It wouldn’t be appropriate to start providing a running
commentary, confirming or denying etc., or providing insights on
operational matters,” he said when asked about the UBS trade.  ANZ opened 6.4 percent higher as 836,205 shares changed
hands in 349 trades, all at the ask price of A$27.63, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock fell back to A$26.13
within a minute and ended the day lower at A$25.95.  ASX publishes the broker code associated with each
transaction three days after the trade has occurred. It doesn’t
specify whether the orders are being executed on behalf of
clients or for the firms themselves.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s broker code appears next to
purchases of more than 550,000 shares of ANZ during the opening
auction on Oct. 18, more than any other broker, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., CLSA Ltd. and Macquarie Group Ltd. were
among brokers purchasing shares at the time, the data show.  Index Open  The S&P/ASX 200 index opened at 4,567.70 at 10 a.m. Oct.
18, 0.87 percent higher than the previous close, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The gain was halved within one
minute, with the gauge falling to 4,547.72, the data show. The
measure closed up 0.7 percent, the highest level since July
2011.  AGL Energy Ltd., which closed Oct. 17 at A$14.84, opened
4.3 percent higher when 177,416 shares changed hands in 107
trades at the price of A$15.84. It closed at A$14.86 yesterday.  AMP Ltd., an insurer, opened 4.5 percent higher when 1.1
million shares were exchanged in 157 trades at A$4.85. The stock
closed 3.7 percent below this level at A$4.67.  Brambles, a supplier of shipping pallets, jumped 7.5
percent to A$7.69 straight after the open before falling to
A$7.38 within the first minute of trade. The shares closed at
A$7.26 in Sydney. The first trades of the day were crossed from
two off-exchange transactions for a total of 50,000 shares at
A$7.65, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
