Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service
is reviewing its decision in 2009 to drop an investigation into
sex-abuse claims against former British Broadcasting Corp. star
Jimmy Savile, who died last year at the age of 84.  Documents from four cases stemming from a police probe in
Surrey,  England , will be examined by the CPS’s principal legal
adviser “out of an abundance of caution,”  Keir Starmer , who
heads the agency, said in a statement today. A regional
prosecutor, Roger Coe-Salazar, has already reviewed the papers,
Starmer said.  “He has assured me that the decisions taken at the time
were the right decisions based on the information and evidence
then available,” Starmer said. The prosecution was abandoned
because the alleged victims didn’t want to support the case, he
said.  Police are investigating claims dating back as far as 1959
through 2006, including those that Savile, who hosted popular
 BBC  shows “Top of the Pops” and “Jim’ll Fix It,” and other
unidentified people abused about 200 people. The claims are
putting pressure on the BBC, the world’s largest public
broadcaster, and other institutions who appointed the
entertainer to programs and positions that dealt with children.  To contact the reporter on this story:
