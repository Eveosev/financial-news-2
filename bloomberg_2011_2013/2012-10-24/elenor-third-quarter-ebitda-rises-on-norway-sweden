Telenor ASA (TEL) , the Nordic region’s
largest phone operator by revenue, reported earnings that beat
analyst estimates, helped by improving sales in its home market.
The shares rose the most in almost four months.  Third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization rose 2.5 percent to 8.53 billion kroner ($1.49
billion), boosted by higher mobile revenue and increasing
subscriptions in Norway and  Sweden , Telenor said today in a
statement. That beat the 8.43 billion-kroner average estimate of
19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Jon Fredrik Baksaas is expanding
the Fornebu, Norway-based company’s wireless network in its home
markets to fend off competitors and boost revenue. Telenor said
last month it plans to find savings of 5 billion kroner over
four years. Telenor is rolling out a faster 4G wireless network
in  Norway  to cover 90 percent of the population in 2015.  “The beat in the Nordics is particularly positive,”
Markus Bjerke, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo, said
in an e-mail. He upgraded his recommendation on the shares to
buy from hold.  Telenor shares rose as much as 4.7 percent, the biggest
intraday jump since June 27. The stock was up 4.6 percent at
109.1 kroner as of 9:53 a.m. in Oslo, bringing the advance to
11 percent this year.  Malaysia Growth  Revenue advanced 2.5 percent to 25.3 billion kroner,
compared with an average estimate of 25.4 billion kroner.  Telenor’s Malaysian division DiGi yesterday reported third-
quarter sales rose 8.4 percent, while DTAC in  Thailand  boosted
revenue 12 percent. Sales at Grameenphone, Telenor’s Bangladesh
business, slipped 1 percent, while the unit added 1.66 million
new subscribers in the quarter.  Telenor said full-year sales will increase about 4 percent,
compared with a previous forecast for growth of more than 4
percent. It reiterated a forecast for adjusted full-year
earnings excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of 35 percent to 36 percent of sales.  The adjusted Ebitda margin in Norway increased to 46.2
percent from 42.9 percent a year earlier, while the margin in
Sweden climbed to 29.6 percent from 27.3 percent. Mobile
subscriptions increased by 63,000 in the two countries.  Net income rose to 3.65 billion kroner from 2.59 billion
kroner a year earlier. Analysts had estimated 3.4 billion, in a
Bloomberg  survey .  Last week, Telenor submitted an application for pre-
qualification in an auction of wireless frequencies in  India .
Telenor reached a deal with its partner  Unitech Ltd. (UT)  that allows
it to move the business of its Indian joint venture to a new
company so it could participate in the auction. India will sell
about $7 billion in airwaves starting Nov. 12 and Telenor must
bid to remain active in the world’s second-largest mobile
market.  Swedish competitor  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  said on Oct. 17 it plans
to cut 2,000 jobs, equivalent to 7 percent of the workforce, to
improve profitability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
