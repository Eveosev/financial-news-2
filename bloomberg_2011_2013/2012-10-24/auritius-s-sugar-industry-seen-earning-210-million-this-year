Mauritius’s sugar industry will
probably earn 6.6 billion rupees ($210 million) for the 2012
harvest, the country’s sugar syndicate said in its first
estimate for the crop.  “Market prices in export destinations appear to have
remained firm,” Devesh Dukhira, chief market officer at the
Port Louis-based MSS, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Prices are forecast to be 16,000 rupees a metric ton,
little changed from last year, according to Dukhira. About
290,000 tons will be sold to customers of  Germany ’s  Suedzucker
AG. (SZU)  Another 120,000 tons of specialty sugars will be sold in the
European Union, the U.S. and about 20 other countries.  Production is forecast at 410,000 tons, according to the
Chamber of Agriculture’s crop estimate committee. That’s a drop
of 5.8 percent from last year.  All of the sugar from the 2011 crop was exported in the
form of “value-added products, up from 83 percent in 2010 and
43 percent in 2009, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
