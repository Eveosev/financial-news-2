Patriot Coal Corp., the U.S. coal
producer that filed for  bankruptcy protection  in July, said
Chief Executive Officer Irl Engelhardt has been replaced by
former Chief Operating Officer Bennett K. Hatfield.  Michael Scharf, the former independent lead director on
Patriot’s board, will take over Engelhardt’s role as chairman,
the St. Louis-based company said in a statement today. Hatfield,
55, joined Patriot in September 2011, after serving  as CEO of
International Coal Group from 2005 until  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI)  bought
the company in 2011.  Engelhardt, a former chairman and CEO of Peabody Energy
Corp., served as Patriot’s chairman since the company was spun
off from Peabody in 2007. He was named CEO in May, on the same
day Hatfield was promoted to president.  Patriot, which listed assets of $3.57 billion and debt of
$3.07 billion when it filed for Chapter 11, fell 3.5 percent to
16.2 cents at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
