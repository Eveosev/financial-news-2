Ethanol futures fell for a third day
in  Chicago  on concern that higher prices for the biofuel would
entice Brazilian imports.  Prices declined after an Energy Department report showed
the U.S.  imported  19,000 barrels a day of ethanol last week,
compared with none a year ago. Refiners bought an average of
122,000 barrels a day from foreign sellers in the week ended
Oct. 12, the highest amount since the agency began reporting
weekly data on the additive in June 2010.  “There’s always the threat that Brazilian supply could
come back into the market,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at
Linn Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery declined 0.4 cent
to $2.402 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
gained 9 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.47 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.40 and in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.455, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Ethanol on the West
Coast added 0.5 cent to $2.55 a gallon.  Brazil Prices  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo , where the fuel is made from
sugar cane, fetched $2.09 a gallon in the week ended Oct. 19,
data compiled by Bloomberg shows. The fuel is made primarily
from corn in the U.S.  Corn for December delivery dropped 1.5 cents to $7.545 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Gasoline for November delivery decreased 0.2 cent to $2.603
a gallon in New York. The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Ethanol’s  discount  to the motor fuel expanded to 20.1 cents
from 19.9 cents yesterday. Gasoline traded at a premium of 99.8
cents to ethanol as recently as Sept. 28.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 36 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
