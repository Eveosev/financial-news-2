German 10-year bunds erased a
decline after reports showed euro-area services and
manufacturing output contracted more than economists forecast in
October and German business confidence unexpectedly fell to a 2
1/2-year low.  The yield on the securities was one basis point lower at
1.56 percent as of 9:06 a.m. London time, after earlier rising
as much as three basis points to 1.60 percent.  A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in both industries fell to 45.8 from 46.1 in September, London-
based  Markit Economics  said today. Economists had forecast a
reading of 46.5, the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey showed. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped to 100.0
from 101.4 in September. Thatâ€™s the sixth straight decline and
the lowest reading since February 2010. Analysts in a separate
Bloomberg News survey predicted an increase to 101.6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
