The seasonal ozone hole above the
Antarctic was the second smallest in 20 years as warm
temperatures slowed depletion of the layer that shields the
planet from ultraviolet radiation, according to the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The average size of the ozone hole this year was 6.9
million square miles (17.9 million square kilometers) and
reached a maximum of 8.2 million square miles on Sept. 22, the
agency said in a  statement  today.  The Antarctic ozone hole first appeared in the 1980s and
was one of the first signs of man-made climate change, according
to the statement. International efforts to regulate
chlorofluorocarbons, the chemicals blamed for the annual event,
may not lead to any measurable recovery in the layer for a
decade.  “It happened to be a bit warmer this year high in the
atmosphere above Antarctica, and that meant we didn’t see quite
as much ozone depletion as we saw last year,”  Jim Butler , the
director of global monitoring at NOAA’s Earth System Research
Laboratory in Boulder,  Colorado , said in the statement.  Last year’s  gap  stretched 10.1 million square miles and was
the ninth largest. The biggest was in 2000 at 11.5 million
square miles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
