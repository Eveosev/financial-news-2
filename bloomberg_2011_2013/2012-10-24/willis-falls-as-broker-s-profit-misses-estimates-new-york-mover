Willis Group Holdings Plc (WSH) , the
third-largest insurance broker, fell the most since August after
profit dropped, missing analysts’ estimates.  Willis declined $1.80, or 5.1 percent, to $33.45 at 12:22
p.m. in New York. Operating profit was 22 cents a share, missing
the 30 cents average  estimate  of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Third-quarter net income plunged to $26 million, or 15
cents a share, from $60 million, or 34 cents, as revenue was
“flat” in  North America , the London-based company said in a
statement yesterday. Salaries and benefits climbed to $502
million from $489 million.  “Despite the economic recovery and improving insurance
rate environment, Willis’ relaxation of several recession-era
expense controls will probably pressure 2013 margins,”  Meyer Shields , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said in a note
yesterday.  The broker has slumped 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
