Slovak Premier  Robert Fico  said
Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS pledged to keep household
prices steady to unlock its purchase of a 49 percent stake in
the country’s largest gas company.  EPH, a Czech private-equity group, is in talks with E.ON
Ruhrgas AG and  GDF Suez (GSZ)  on purchasing their stake in Slovensky
Plynarensky Priemysel AS. The Slovak government, which holds the
majority in the utility, on Oct. 17 refused to approve the
transaction after Slovensky had filed a request for a 25 percent
increase in gas prices for households from January.  The government will discuss the transaction again on Nov.
24 following further negotiations with the potential buyer, Fico
told journalists today in Gabcikovo, Slovakia. EPH also pledged
to withdraw from all disputes SPP is currently having with the
state over price caps, he said.  Fico has criticized the current two foreign investors, who
have a majority on the utility’s board, for seeking increases in
household prices that ignore living standards in the euro-area’s
second-poorest country.  Slovensky said its 2011 after-tax profit of 564 million
euros ($730 million) was affected by a 50 million-euro loss on
sales to domestic clients because of excessive price regulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
