Tempur-Pedic International Inc. (TPX) , the
mattress maker acquiring rival  Sealy Corp. (ZZ) , sank the most in
more than four months after cutting its 2012 profit forecast
amid increased U.S. competition and weakening sales in Europe.  The shares fell 22 percent to $24.81 at 10:08 a.m. in  New
York  and earlier dropped as much as 23 percent for the biggest
intraday decline since June 6. The Lexington, Kentucky-based
company’s stock had declined 39 percent this year through the
close of regular trading yesterday.  Intensifying competition that led Tempur-Pedic to agree
last month to buy Trinity, North Carolina-based Sealy for about
$229 million is persisting, Chief Executive Officer Mark Sarvary
said in a statement yesterday. International sales advanced 11
percent, excluding currencies, slowing from growth of 17 percent
in the second quarter.  “The drop off in  Europe  is an emerging concern,” Peter Keith, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. in New York, wrote today
in a note. He rates Tempur-Pedic as neutral, equivalent of a
hold recommendation. “The pending acquisition of Sealy only
clouds the picture further.”  Profit in the current year will about $2.55 a share, down
from a forecast of about $2.80 in July and trailing 12 analysts’
average projection of $2.78. The company trimmed its sales
estimate to about $1.4 billion from a previous forecast of $1.43
billion. Analysts estimated $1.43 billion.  The full-year forecast assumes the Sealy transaction won’t
be completed in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
