Morgan Keegan & Co., the brokerage
firm acquired by  Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF) , must pay a group
of 18 investors a $9.2 million arbitration award, a federal
appeals court said.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in New Orleans today reinstated
the award by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. A
federal judge in Houston erroneously found that the award was
procured through fraud and that the arbitrators had exceeded
their powers, according to the appellate court’s decision.  The investors claimed Memphis, Tennessee-based Morgan
Keegan induced them to invest in four “highly risky” mutual
funds, according to the decision. They alleged Morgan Keegan
intentionally overvalued the assets held by the funds and used
principal from the funds to pay dividends, according to the
appellate court’s ruling.  Steve Hollister, a spokesman for  St. Petersburg , Florida-
based Raymond James, didn’t immediately return a call to his
office after regular business hours seeking comment on the
ruling.  The case is Morgan Keegan v. John Garrett, 11-20736, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ( New Orleans ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
