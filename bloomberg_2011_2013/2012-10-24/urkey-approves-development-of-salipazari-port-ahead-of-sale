Turkey  approved plans to develop
the Salipazari cruiser port in Istanbul before the government
sells the asset at an auction.  The port, owned by the government’s port and maritime
operator Turkiye Denizcilik Isletmeleri AS, will include roads
and recreational facilities once it is completed by the new
operator, the Ankara-based government privatization board said
in a decree published in the  Official Gazette  today.  Turkey’s asset sales agency plans to auction operational
rights at the port by the year end, Ahmet Aksu, head of the
agency, told the state-run Anatolia news agency July 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
