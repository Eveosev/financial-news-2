Brinker International Inc. (EAT) , owner of
the Chili’s and Maggiano’s dining chains, fell the most in more
than three years after forecasting profit that was less than
analysts estimated amid slowing store sales.  The shares dropped 8.2 percent to $30.70 at 10:52 a.m. in
New York, after falling 12 percent for the biggest intraday
decline since August 2009. Dallas-based Brinker had gained 25
percent this year through yesterday.  Fiscal second-quarter profit, excluding certain items, will
be as much as 50 cents a share, Chief Financial Officer Guy Constant said during a conference call today. Analysts  estimated 
55 cents, the average of 18 projections compiled by Bloomberg.  Brinker has advertised a $20 dinner for two and new
cocktails at Chili’s to attract customers as competition among
casual-dining chains increases. Comparable-store sales in the
second quarter are slowing and will be more erratic going
forward, Wyman Roberts, president of Chili’s, said during the
call.  There are about 1,585 Chili’s and Maggiano’s restaurants
worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
