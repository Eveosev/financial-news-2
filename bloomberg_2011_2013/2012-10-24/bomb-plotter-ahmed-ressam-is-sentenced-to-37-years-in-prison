Ahmed Ressam, convicted of plotting
to blow up Los Angeles International Airport on the last day of
1999, was sentenced to 37 years in prison and five years of
supervised release.  The punishment imposed today is the third sentence issued
by U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour in  Seattle  after an
appeals court ruled the judge’s previous 22-year prison term was
too short.  Ressam was convicted in 2001 of conspiracy and carrying
explosives and is known as the Millennium Bomber. A native of
 Algeria , Ressam was arrested in Port Angeles,  Washington , in
December 1999 as he drove off a ferry from British Columbia,
 Canada , with a trunk filled with bomb-making materials.  After his conviction, Ressam cooperated with the government
for almost two years by providing information about terrorist
network al-Qaeda’s recruitment and training activities,
according to court filings. Ressam then stopped cooperating and
recanted his prior testimony.  “A sentence of 37 years promotes respect for the law by
punishing Mr. Ressam for his serious crimes while providing a
reward for the cooperation that Mr. Ressam provided,”
Coughenour said in today’s sentencing order. “It is no more
than what is necessary to account for his recantations.”  Thomas W. Hillier, a federal public defender who
represented Ressam, didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment.  The case is U.S. v. Ressam, 99-cr-00666, U.S. District
Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle).  To contact the reporter on this story:
