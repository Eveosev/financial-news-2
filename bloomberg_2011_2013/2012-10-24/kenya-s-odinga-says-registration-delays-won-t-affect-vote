Kenyan Prime Minister  Raila Odinga 
said the March 4 date set for national elections is “cast in
stone” and won’t be affected by delays in the voter
registration process.  “I want to state categorically that this country is
preparing for, and will hold elections on March 4, 2013,”
Odinga told reporters today in the capital, Nairobi. “Not a day
earlier. Not a day later.”  Kenya has received 169 of the 15,000 biometric voter
registration kits the government expected to be delivered by
Oct. 22, Odinga said. The  Finance Ministry  has pledged to pay
for the equipment within two days. Once it arrives, Kenya plans
to start the process of enrolling more than 18 million eligible
voters within 30 days, Ahmed Issack Hassan, chairman of the
Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission, said today.  The elections will be  Kenya ’s first since allegations of
vote-rigging in a December 2007 presidential poll sparked two
months of ethnic and political clashes that left more than 1,100
people dead in  East Africa ’s largest economy.  The election commission abandoned plans in July to use
biometric technology to ensure voting was accurate, only to
reverse itself a week later.  Kenya’s Appeals Court in July confirmed the March 4 date
chosen by the election commission. The country’s two year-old
constitution stipulates elections should be held the second
Tuesday of August, every five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
