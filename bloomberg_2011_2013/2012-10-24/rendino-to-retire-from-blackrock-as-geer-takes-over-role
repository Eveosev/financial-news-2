Kevin Rendino , a senior fund manager
at  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , will retire from the world’s largest asset-
management firm next month, spokeswoman Jessica Greaney said.  Rendino, 46, announced his decision last month and will
remain at the firm until the end of November to help the
transition, Greaney said. Bartlett Geer, based in Boston, is
replacing Rendino as head of the firm’s Basic Value Equity team.  Geer is taking over BlackRock’s  Basic Value Fund (MDBAX)  and
related investments that totaled $10 billion at the end of
August, according to a statement from the firm. The fund has
lost 0.6 percent over the past month, beating 94 percent of
similar funds, and is down less than 0.4 percent in five years,
outperforming 52 percent of rivals, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has fallen 3.3
percent in the past month and is 7.1 percent below its level
five years ago.  Rendino came to BlackRock from Merrill Lynch Investment
Managers when the firms merged in 2006. He couldn’t be reached
for comment by e-mail.  Geer will report to Chris Leavy, BlackRock’s chief
investment officer of fundamental equities for the Americas.
Before joining BlackRock, Geer was a managing director and fund
manager at  Putnam Investments .  To contact the reporter on this story:
