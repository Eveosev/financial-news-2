Asian currencies weakened, led by
the Philippine peso, as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen
damped the export outlook and curbed demand for riskier assets.  Asian stocks fell for a fourth day after Greek Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras faced opposition from coalition
partners on austerity measures needed to win 31 billion euros
($40 billion) of international aid. Global funds sold $190
million more Taiwanese, South Korean and Thai stocks than they
bought yesterday, exchange data show.  “There was a souring of risk sentiment overnight,” said
Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd.
“There are still lingering concerns about Europe.”  The peso declined 0.1 percent to 41.363 per dollar in
Manila, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysia’s
ringgit fell 0.1 percent to 3.0598, touching a one-week low, and
Thailand’s baht slipped 0.1 percent to 30.77. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index of shares dropped 0.5 percent, taking its decline
since Oct. 18 to 1.5 percent.  The baht fell for a fifth day, its longest streak since
August, even as exports halted a three-month contraction. The
government said today shipments rose 0.2 percent last month from
a year earlier, versus a median forecast for a 2.7 percent drop
in a Bloomberg survey.  “Investors are worried about the global economic
slowdown,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of the investment trust
and fixed-income business at Rakuten Securities Inc. in  Tokyo .
“This is feeding into the deterioration in the export outlook
for Asia and weighing on regional currencies.”  Philippine Rates  Fourteen of 21 analysts in a separate Bloomberg survey
predict the Philippine central bank will lower its benchmark
rate to 3.50 percent tomorrow from 3.75 percent. Seven forecast
no change. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has trimmed its overnight
rate three times this year as the local currency rallied 6
percent. Overseas sales dropped 9 percent in August from a year
earlier, while inflation slowed to 3.6 percent in September,
official data show.  “Weakening exports, decelerating inflation and the rapid
appreciation of the peso should compel the central bank to
cut,” said Emilio Neri, an economist at  Bank of the Philippine
Islands (BPI)  in  Manila .  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics’ preliminary reading
for a purchasing managers’ index in  China  released today was
49.1 in October, compared with a final result of 47.9 last month.
A reading below 50 signals contraction. The  yuan  was unchanged
at 6.2480 per dollar, after gaining 0.11 percent yesterday.  Elsewhere, South Korea’s won weakened 0.1 percent to
1,103.74 per dollar, while Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.1 percent to
NT$29.342 after rising as much as 0.2 percent.  Indonesia ’s
rupiah advanced 0.2 percent to 9,585 and Vietnam’s dong was
little changed at 20,848. Financial markets in  India  were closed
for a holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
