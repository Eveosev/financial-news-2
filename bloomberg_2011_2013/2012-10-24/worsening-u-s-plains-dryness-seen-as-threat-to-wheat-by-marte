Worsening dryness in the U.S. is a
threat to hard red winter wheat, agricultural-weather forecaster
Martell Crop Projections said.  Dry weather has resumed in the southern Great Plains after
a wet September, slowing germination of the grain, Martell wrote
in an e-mailed report today. Half of the hard red winter wheat
has emerged with 80 percent planted, and the gap widened in
October on worsening dryness, Martell wrote.  Much of Kansas and  Oklahoma , the largest producers of the
hard red winter wheat variety used to make bread, are in severe
to extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.  “Other seasons with pre-planting drought have led to a
reduced harvest, with few exceptions,” Whitefish Bay,
Wisconsin-based Martell wrote. “Without an abundant store of
subsoil moisture, hard red winter wheat has become more
vulnerable to moisture stress.”  Very dry winters bring a risk of soil erosion, with winds
picking up loose dirt that can damage wheat and bury small
plants, according to the forecaster. Satellite images showed
strong, gusty winds caused a dust veil in the Great Plains last
week, Martell said.  The trend for drier weather in the Great Plains may be
linked to a weakening El Nino, a warming of the  Pacific Ocean ,
