Italian  consumer confidence  gained
for a second month in October as households grew more optimistic
about the economy and the government announced tax cuts for the
lowest earners.  The confidence index rose to 86.4 from 86.2 in September,
the national statistics office,  Istat , said in  Rome  today. The
reading matched the median forecast in a survey of 15 economists
by  Bloomberg News .  The Italian economy contracted at a slower pace in the
three months through September and will emerge next year from
its fourth recession since 2001, the country’s central bank said
in its quarterly economic bulletin last week. Prime Minister
 Mario Monti ’s government announced this month that it would cut
the two lowest income tax rates by 1 percentage point in its
2013 budget, partly to ease the impact of an increase in value
added tax due next year.  Monti’s popularity fell by almost half to 37 percent from
71 percent on Nov. 28, two weeks after he became premier,
according to a poll published last week by the SWG Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
