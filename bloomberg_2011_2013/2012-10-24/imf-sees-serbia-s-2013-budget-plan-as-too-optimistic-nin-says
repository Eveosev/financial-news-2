The  International Monetary Fund 
calculates  Serbia  overestimated revenue and underestimated
spending in its 2013 budget plan,  NIN  reported, citing a person
it didn’t name.  The government forsees a consolidated budget deficit of 130
billion dinars next year, equivalent to 3.5 percent of forecast
gross domestic product, Belgrade-based weekly NIN said. The
multinational lender estimates the gap will reach 165 billion
dinars without additional cuts, or 4.5 percent of GDP, which
would reduce the chances of a new loan program for the Balkan
nation, NIN said.  An IMF delegation is due to visit Serbia next month and
will ask the government to reverse some of the changes it made
to central bank law in August that curbed the institution’s
autonomy, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
