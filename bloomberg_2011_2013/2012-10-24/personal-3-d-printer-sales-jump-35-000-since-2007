Sales of 3-D printers for personal
use have exploded since 2007, mimicking the personal-computing
revolution of the 1990s, as the market expands from industrial-
grade systems costing as much as $1 million.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows sales of printers that create
solid objects and cost less than $5,000 grew more than 35,000
percent to 23,265 in 2011 from 66 five years ago, according to a
report from Wohlers Associates, Inc., a consulting firm in Fort
Collins,  Colorado . Sales of printers averaging $73,220 rose 31
percent, to 6,494 from 4,938.  Until recently, 3-D printing was limited to large companies
that could afford the industrial machines. Daimler AG,  Honda
Motor Co. (7267) ,  Boeing Co. (BA)  and  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  all have used 3-
D printers to fashion prototypes and make parts that go into
final products.  “To me, this change is similar to the supercomputers of
the 1970s that were only affordable to the major corporations,
and now we’re in a period analogous to the 1980s, where the
personal computer came about; now we have personal printing,”
said Jeff Moe, founder of  Aleph Objects Inc. , a Loveland,
Colorado-based maker of the less-expensive machines. “Not only
does that mean that people can print in their homes, but also
the engineers can even do it at companies as well.”  Most 3-D printers work by using a nozzle driven by data
from a computer program to layer melted plastic or resin,
creating three-dimensional objects. Some printers also can build
objects made of other materials, including glass and metal. The
less-expensive personal devices and open-source nature of many
designs they can produce allow users to customize their own
products. Personalized iPhone cases and jewelry are some of the
possibilities.  Continuum Fashion , a business based in New York, has
designed and printed apparel such as shoes and bikinis on one of
the more-expensive machines and soon will start a service
allowing buyers to submit body measurements to manufacture
custom clothing, according to co-founder Jenna Fizel.  “You can’t print a bikini in your house at this point
unless you’re a billionaire,” Fizel said in a telephone
interview. “But I’m really excited about what is starting to be
available to the home market.” Maybe “the next really awesome
3-D printing technique won’t be made in a $100,000 machine,
it’ll be made in a $2,000 machine.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
