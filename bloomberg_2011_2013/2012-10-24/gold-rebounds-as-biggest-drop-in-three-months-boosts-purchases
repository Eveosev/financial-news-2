Gold futures fell below $1,700 an
ounce to a six-week low as European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said his plan to buy  government bonds  “will not lead to
inflation.”  Draghi said in Berlin that “in our assessment, the greater
risk to  price stability  is currently falling prices in some
euro-area countries.” Gold rallied this year as the  Federal
Reserve  expanded economic-stimulus measures. The central bank
said today that unemployment remains elevated as it maintains
$40 billion in monthly purchases of mortgage-backed securities.  “The market is sensing the deflationary worries, and that
is not good for gold,” Michael Gayed, the chief investment
strategist and co-portfolio manager of ATAC Inflation Rotation
Fund at New York-based Pension Partners LLC, which advises on
more than $150 million in assets, said in a telephone interview.
“There was nothing new from the Fed, so the market tone
remained bearish.”  Gold futures for December delivery traded at $1,703.30 at
4:27 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The metal settled at
$1,701.60 today, down 0.5 percent. After the close, the price
touched $1,698.70, the lowest for a most-active contract since
Sept. 7.  “Gold is not getting any support since people are not
talking about an inflation spike,”  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview. “The slowdown concerns are also weighing
on gold.”  Fed Meeting  In mid-September, the Fed announced its third round of
easing and said will probably keep its benchmark  interest rate 
close to zero percent until at least the middle of 2015.  The Fed’s announcement drove gold earlier in October to the
highest in almost 11 months. The central bank concluded its two-
day meeting today.  “The market now thinks that probably $40 billion a month
may not be enough to boost growth that can be sustained,” Gayed
of Pension Partners said.  This year, gold has advanced 8.6 percent. In October, the
price has averaged $1,755.28, the highest since September 2011,
when the metal surged to an intraday record of $1,923.70.  Silver futures for December delivery slid 0.5 percent to
$31.62 an ounce in New York. Earlier, the metal touched $31.535,
the lowest since Aug. 31.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery dropped 0.8 percent to $1,562.70 an ounce. The
metal declined for the fifth straight session, the longest slump
since Aug. 30.  Palladium futures for December delivery slipped 0.2 percent
to $592.75 an ounce. The price dropped for the fifth straight
session, the longest slump since May 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
