HSH Nordbank AG provided 42 million
euros ($54 million) in loans to Aquila Capital Concepts GmbH, a
German  investment company , for a French solar park it bought
from EDF Energies Nouvelles SA.  The funds include a 32 million-euro project-finance loan
for the 10.8 megawatt Avon-les-Roches facility in Toul, HSH
Nordbank said today in an e-mailed statement.  The non-recourse loan has an 18-year maturity, Eleonore
Kleuters, a renewable-energy originator at the Hamburg-based
bank, said by phone. HSH Nordbank also provided Aquila with an
8.5 million-euro short-term VAT facility and a 1.5 million-euro
working capital facility, again short-term, Kleuters said.  Aquila provided the equity for the operational project
developed in north eastern  France  by the clean energy unit of
EDF,  Europe â€™s biggest utility, according to Kleuters.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
