Trafigura Beheer BV failed to buy
 North Sea  Forties blend at the lowest price in almost one month.
Vitol Group sold Russian Urals in the Mediterranean at a bigger
discount to Dated Brent.  Eight Nigerian crude cargoes for loading in November remain
unsold, said three traders involved in the region’s market. Iraq
plans to increase exports of its Kirkuk grade in November from
the Turkish port of Ceyhan to 24 lots, four more than this
month, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  North Sea  Trafigura didn’t manage to buy a Forties consignment for
loading on Nov. 10 to Nov. 16 at 50 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, the lowest since Sept. 28, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading
window. The blend was last sold at a discount of 20 cents on
Oct. 22.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was unchanged at 19 cents a
barrel less than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for December settlement traded at $107.70 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $107.64 yesterday. The January contract
was at $106.82, a discount of 88 cents to December.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol sold 80,000 metric tons of Urals for Nov. 3 to Nov. 7
loading to Glencore International Plc at $1.20 a barrel less
than Dated Brent, on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the
survey showed. This compares with a discount of $1.15 for the
last trade on Oct. 17.  Urals blend rose by 6 cents to a discount of 96 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent in northwest  Europe , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Russia’s OAO Surgutneftegas sold two cargoes of 100,000
tons of the crude for loading from the Baltic port of Primorsk
to Repsol SA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, said two traders with
knowledge of the matter.  Repsol bought one lot for loading on Nov. 6 to Nov. 7 and
Shell the other for Nov. 10 to Nov. 11, the people said,
declining to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Shipments of Kirkuk will total 13.5 million barrels, or
450,700 barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares with
431,290 barrels planned for October.  West Africa  Qua Iboe was $1.75 a barrel more than Dated Brent, down 4
cents from the previous session, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The majority of unsold cargoes are of the two grades, said
the people who declined to be identified as the information is
confidential. The speed at which the lots have found buyers is
slower than normal for this time of the month, they said.  Supply uncertainties remain in  Nigeria  after a force
majeure on Bonny Light and Forcados exports and as Total SA
halted production, the traders said. Shell declared force
majeure on Bonny Light and Forcados shipments on Oct. 19
following unplanned disruptions.  Nigeria lost as much as 500,000 barrels a day of output in
the wake of two months of flooding that deluged  oil fields  in
the Niger River delta and is now restarting some of the
platforms.  The Republic of Congo will export six Djeno cargoes of
920,000 barrels each in December, one more than November,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The west African nation plans to keep exports of N’Kossa
grade unchanged at two consignments of 950,000 barrels each, the
schedule showed.  Ghana will ship three 950,000 barrel cargoes of Jubilee in
December, including one deferred from the end of November,
according to a loading program. Exports for November were
revised down to two lots from three, the plan showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
