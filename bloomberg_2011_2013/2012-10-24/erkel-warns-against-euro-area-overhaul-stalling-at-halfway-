German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
euro-area governments struggling in the debt crisis must press
ahead with economic overhauls or face greater pain later.  Countries “from Ireland to  Portugal  to Spain and  Italy ”
have “set a lot in motion” on structural reforms, Merkel said
in a speech to the BGA export-industry association in Berlin
today. Change “was urgently needed, but also hadn’t been dealt
with for a long time.”  Merkel’s comments reflect her insistence that boosting
competitiveness, with changes such as lowering labor costs in
the 17 countries sharing the euro, is the key to beating the
debt crisis now in its fourth year.  “Of course, all of this leads to incredible sacrifices for
the people in those countries, but we also know that if it
doesn’t happen now, the pain will be worse tomorrow or the day
after,” Merkel said. “We can’t stop at the halfway mark.
Rather, we have to keep moving on this path because there’s no
way around the competitiveness issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
