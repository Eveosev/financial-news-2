Pennvest awarded $79 million in low-
cost loans and grants for drinking water and sewer projects in
16 Pennsylvania counties, Governor Tom Corbett announced.  Financing from the Pennsylvania infrastructure investment
agency included almost $13 million to the Williamsburg Municipal
Authority to upgrade a water treatment plant and add six miles
of sewer collection lines to reduce discharges into the
Chesapeake Bay.  The South Wayne County Water and Sewer Authority received
almost $10 million to replace 20 miles of deteriorated water
mains and curb “very high water losses,” the governor said.
About $1.5 million was loaned to the Chester County conservation
district to help reduce runoff into the west branch of the
Brandywine Creek and Christina River.  To contact the reporter on this story:
