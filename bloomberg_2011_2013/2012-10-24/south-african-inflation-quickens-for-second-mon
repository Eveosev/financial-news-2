South Africa ’s inflation rate rose
for a second month in September to 5.5 percent, more than
economists expected, as fuel and food prices climbed and a
weaker rand boosted import costs.  Inflation accelerated from 5 percent in August, Pretoria-
based Statistics South Africa said on its website today. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 20 economists was 5.2
percent. Prices rose 0.9 percent in the month.  The  Reserve Bank  left its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged
at 5 percent on Sept. 20, after reducing it by half a percentage
point in July, concerned that rising food and fuel costs will
drive up prices in the economy. The bank’s target is to keep
inflation within a range of 3 percent to 6 percent.  “There is more pressure building up because of imported
inflation coming through the weak rand, food inflation rising
and fuel inflation going up,”  Colen Garrow , chief economist at
Johannesburg-based Meganomics, said in a telephone interview.
“Policy will be on hold at the Reserve Bank.”  Bonds fell after the data was released. The yield on the
rand bond due in 2021 rose 5 basis points to 6.67 percent, while
the yield on the 2015 security increased 4 basis points to 5.44
percent.  Gasoline Prices  Oil prices  have gained 16 percent in  New York  in the 12
months through September, prompting the government to raise
gasoline costs by 1.9 percent in October and 8.4 percent in
September. Corn has gained 28 percent on the Chicago Board of
Trade during the same period, while white corn, a staple in
South Africa, has increased 3 percent on the South African
Futures Exchange.  The  yield gap  between fixed-rate debt due in 2017 and
similar maturity inflation-linked securities, a measure of
inflation expectations, rose 3 basis points to 5.53 percentage
points after today’s data.  The rand’s depreciation is adding to pressure on inflation.
The currency has dropped 6.2 percent against the dollar since
Sept. 27 when Moody’s Investors Service cut the nation’s rating
by one level to Baa1. That’s the biggest decline of more than
160 currencies tracked by Bloomberg over that period.  The currency erased a gain after the inflation data,
dropping 0.2 percent to 8.7816 per dollar at 10:34 a.m. in
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
