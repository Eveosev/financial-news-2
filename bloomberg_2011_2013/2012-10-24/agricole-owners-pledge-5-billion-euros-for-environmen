Credit Agricole  SA’s French regional
banks, which own the company, pledged 5 billion euros ($6.5
billion) of loans through 2015 for renewable-energy and
environment-protection projects.  The lending shows Credit Agricole and its shareholders are
“capable of providing innovative answers to big social
expectations,” Paris-based Federation Nationale du Credit
Agricole, which represents the 39 regional banks, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Executives from the federation will meet tomorrow in
Brussels for an event held every two years to discuss the future
of cooperative lending. The regional banks own 56 percent of
Credit Agricole and control 2,500 small, local lenders closely
held by their 7 million customers.  Credit Agricole fits “in the scope of what Liikanen calls
a universal bank,” Philippe Brassac, secretary general of the
federation, said on a call with journalists, referring to
European Central Bank Governing Council Member Erkki Liikanen’s
proposals on banking reform.  Credit Agricole has no plans to withdraw its listed entity
from the stock market, Dominique Lefebvre, chairman of the
federation, said on the same call.  Credit Agricole,  France ’s third-largest bank by market
value, last week agreed to sell Athens-based Emporiki Bank to
Alpha Bank SA on terms it said will cut third-quarter net income
by about 2 billion euros. The lender is ending a six-year
investment in  Greece  as concerns linger about the country’s
future in the euro area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
