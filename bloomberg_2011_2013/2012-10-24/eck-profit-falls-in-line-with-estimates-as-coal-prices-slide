Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) ,  Canada ’s
largest diversified miner, said third-quarter profit slumped 78
percent as prices for steelmaking coal fell.  Net income  dropped to C$180 million ($181.6 million), or 31
cents a share, from C$814 million, or C$1.37, a year earlier,
Vancouver-based Teck said today in a statement. Excluding one-
time items, profit was 60 cents a share, compared with the 59-
cent average  estimate  of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales declined 26 percent to C$2.51 billion.  Prices for metallurgical coal, used by steelmakers, have
dropped this year as Asian growth slowed and global demand
eased. Benchmark contract prices for the fourth quarter fell to
$170 a metric ton from $225 in the previous quarter, Orest Wowkodaw, a Toronto-based analyst at Canaccord Financial Inc.,
said in a Sept. 16 note.  China  is “experiencing a slowdown in steel production and
Teck is feeling it,” John Goldsmith, Toronto-based vice
president of Canadian equities at Montrusco Bolton Investments
Inc., said in an interview before the announcement. Montrusco
Bolton oversees C$5.1 billion and doesn’t own Teck stock.  Teck has deferred about C$1.5 billion of capital spending
from its original 2012 and 2013 budgets, and is cutting costs
across its businesses to shave at least C$200 million from
annual operating expenses.  Coal sales accounted for 57 percent of operating income
last year, up from 7.6 percent in 2007, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. The company reduced coal output over the
third quarter, and said annual volumes will meet the lower end
of its guidance of 24.5 million metric tons.  The company, which also mines copper, zinc and molybdenum
in the Americas, maintained its total production target for the
year.  Teck  dropped  2.5 percent to C$30.54 at the close in Toronto
yesterday. The shares have declined 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
