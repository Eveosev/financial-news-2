The Canadian government takes  public
opinion  into account when reviewing foreign takeovers of
Canadian companies, Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver said.  “This is a democracy and the government takes into account
the opinions of Canadians,” Oliver told reporters today in
Ottawa.  Oliver says he’s heard a “variety of opinions” regarding
investment by Chinese state-owned companies in  Canada .  The Canadian government is currently reviewing  Cnooc Ltd.’s (883) 
$15.1 billion takeover offer for Calgary-based  Nexen Inc. (NXY)   Albertans oppose full Chinese ownership of companies in the
province, and are more open to allowing investors from the Asian
country to hold minority stakes, according to a poll by the
University of Alberta released today.  Sixty-four percent of Albertans disagreed with the
statement that full ownership by Chinese investors is
acceptable, while 15 percent agreed, according to the poll
commissioned by the university’s China Institute. When asked
about partial ownership by Chinese investors, 36 percent were
opposed and 37 percent in favor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
