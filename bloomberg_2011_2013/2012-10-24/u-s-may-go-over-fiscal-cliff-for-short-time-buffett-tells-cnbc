Warren Buffett , the billionaire
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said lawmakers may fail to
resolve disputes over the U.S. budget before the so-called
fiscal cliff imposes spending cuts and tax increases in January.  There’s a “pretty fair chance we go over for a short
period of time,” Buffett, 82, told CNBC today. Reaching a
compromise “depends on which fellow is elected president, and
it depends on the composition of the House, but it’s going to
get done. How long do they want to be in the sandbox before they
come up with an answer that’s obvious and they could come up
with today?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
