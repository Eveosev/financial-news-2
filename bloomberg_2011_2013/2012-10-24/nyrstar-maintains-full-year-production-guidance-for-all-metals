Nyrstar NV (NYR) , the world’s largest
producer of refined zinc, maintained its full-year guidance for
total metals production after zinc output declined 5 percent in
the third quarter.  Zinc metal production fell to 266,000 tons in the July-
September period from 279,000 tons in the prior quarter, the
Balen, Belgium-based company said today in a statement. Nyrstar,
which said year-to-date production is “in line with 2011,”
forecasts full-year zinc output of about 1.1 million tons,
compared with 1.125 million tons last year.  Third-quarter production of zinc in concentrate increased
to 80,000 tons, up 5 percent from the prior period, Nyrstar
said.  Nyrstar  shares  have declined 23 percent this year and
closed at 4.69 euros in Brussels yesterday, down 2.2 percent on
the day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
