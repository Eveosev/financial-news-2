Portugal ’s rising debt level is
limiting the country’s ability to strike a balance between
reducing the budget  deficit  and supporting growth, the
 International Monetary Fund  said after approving the
disbursement of 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) as part of a
bailout package with the European Union.  Meeting the targets attached to the loan has become harder
because of weaker global demand and rising unemployment, the
Washington-based IMF said today. While the extra time given to
Portugal to reduce its deficits is welcome, the fund said that
“room for maneuver has diminished” because debt is set to peak
at about 124 percent of gross domestic product in 2014.  “Additional efforts are necessary, with the support of
euro-area partners, to further advance fiscal consolidation and
boost long-term growth,” Deputy Managing Director Nemat Shafik,
who chaired the meeting, said in a press release.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
joblessness and a deepening recession as he cuts spending and
raises taxes to meet the terms of the 78 billion-euro
international aid plan. With the weaker economy sapping  tax
revenue , the IMF has recommended giving countries such as
Portugal and Greece more time to meet their budget shortfall
goals.  “A prompt completion of the planned expenditure review
would help rebalance the adjustment effort, which currently is
predominantly based on revenue measures,” Shafik said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
