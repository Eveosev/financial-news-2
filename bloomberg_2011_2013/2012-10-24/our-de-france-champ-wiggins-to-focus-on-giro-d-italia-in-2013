Bradley Wiggins doesn’t see himself
defending his  Tour de France  title next July, and plans to help
teammate Chris Froome instead.  Wiggins said he intends to focus on the Giro d’Italia in
May and repay a favor to Froome in the French race. Froome
helped him become the first British winner.  “Cycling is a team sport and I wouldn’t have won the
race” without my Team Sky teammates, Wiggins told Eurosport.  The 32-year-old Londoner won the race by 3 minutes, 21
seconds from second-placed Froome. Italy’s Vincenzo Nibali was
6:19 off the lead in third.  Froome, a Kenyan-born Briton, led Wiggins up the most
difficult mountain passes in the Alps and Pyrenees, slowing
several times to let him catch up.  Wiggins said that along with the Tour de  France  and the
one-day Paris-Roubaix, the Giro is “the only other race that’s
up there” in prestige.  “I’d love to try and win the Giro, I’m a great historian
of the sport,” Wiggins said.  He added that his plans were still subject to approval by
Manchester, England-based Team Sky.  To contact the reporters on this story:
