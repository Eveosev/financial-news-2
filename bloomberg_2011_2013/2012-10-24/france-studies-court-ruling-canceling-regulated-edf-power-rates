France  is considering a court ruling
that canceled regulated power rates by Electricite de France SA
during 2009 and 2010, Environment Minister Delphine Batho said.  The nation’s highest court canceled rates set from Aug. 15,
2009, to Aug. 13, 2010, because their basis wasn’t properly
explained in a government decree announcing the charges.  The country is carrying out a technical study of the effect
of the decision, Batho said after a parliamentary hearing. The
ruling shows power rates are “ill-adapted,” she said earlier.  Lawmakers are debating a proposal to vary power and natural
gas rates depending on whether families use energy efficiently.
Draft legislation stems from a campaign pledge by President
Francois Hollande to lower energy costs for consumers and has
been criticized by the opposition, consumer groups and labor
unions, and was voted down by a Senate commission yesterday.  The government has also set gas charges at a rate that the
regulator deems too low to cover the cost of supply.  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA
Executive Vice-President Jean-Marie Dauger said yesterday it was
possible the government would be taken to court over the rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
