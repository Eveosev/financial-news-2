Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Latin
America’s largest lender, rose the most since June on optimism
it will be able to sustain returns to investors even as  Brazil ’s
government pressures banks to reduce consumer borrowing costs.  Shares gained 4.1 percent to 29.58 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, snapping a five-day decline. The benchmark
Bovespa index slid 0.9 percent.  Management “believes that lower provision charges and
solid cost control should offset weak revenue generation” and
“sounded confident that returns should rebound from current
levels,”  Mario Pierry , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in
a note to clients today after a conference call with bank
executives including Chief Financial Officer Caio Ibrahim David.
Itau fell to a three-month low yesterday after saying service-
fee revenue and net interest income fell in the third quarter.  Itau Unibanco’s earnings per share fell 11 percent to 76
centavos in the three months through September, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday.  President  Dilma Rousseff  has demanded that state-controlled
 Banco do Brasil SA  and Caixa Economica Federal lower rates and
fees, prompting private banks to follow suit in order not to
lose their stake in the market.  Itau Unibanco has fallen 13 percent this year as the Sao
Paulo-based bank cut its average monthly  interest rate  on
consumer loans to 3.38 percent earlier in October. On Oct. 17,
the bank also announced it would reduce some service fees by as
much as 33 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
