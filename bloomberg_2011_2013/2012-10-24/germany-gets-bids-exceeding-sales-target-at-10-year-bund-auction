Germany got bids exceeding its
maximum target at a sale of 10-year bunds for the first time in
three auctions of the securities.  The nation received bids for 5.06 billion euros of the
September 2022 securities, versus a 4 billion-euro goal for the
sale. It sold the bonds to yield 1.56 percent, up from 1.52
percent at an auction on Sept. 26 and the  highest rate  at a 10-
year offering since April.  The Bundesbank provided the auction data in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
