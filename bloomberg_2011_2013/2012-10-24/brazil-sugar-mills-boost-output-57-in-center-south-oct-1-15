Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, jumped 57 percent
in the first half of this month, industry group Unica said.  Output in the region rose to 2.79 million metric tons
between Oct. 1 and Oct. 15 from 1.78 million a year earlier, Sao
Paulo-based Unica said in an e-mailed statement today. The
current crop year started April 1.  Mills in the Center South, where about a fifth of the
world’s sugar is produced, processed 38 million tons of cane in
the period, up from 23.4 million tons a year earlier. Ethanol
output rose 46 percent to 1.61 billion liters (425 million
gallons).  The region’s mills turned about 51.5 percent of the cane
into sugar in the first half of this month, up from 49.8 percent
a year earlier. The rest was processed into fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
