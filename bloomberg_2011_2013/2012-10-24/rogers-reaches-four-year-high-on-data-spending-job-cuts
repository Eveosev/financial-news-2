(Correct number of job cuts in third paragraph.)  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  climbed
to its highest level in more than four years after reporting
profit that surpassed estimates, helped by an 18 percent jump in
smartphone data spending and cost cuts.  Rogers advanced 3.3 percent to C$42.43 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto, the highest price since June 2008.  Canada ’s largest
wireless carrier has climbed 8.1 percent this year .  Rogers has responded to faster growth in wireless and
discounting by smaller rivals  BCE Inc. (BCE)  and  Telus Corp. (T)  with its
own deals to retain smartphone customers. To absorb the impact
of subsidies on popular devices like  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone, Rogers
squeezed more costs from operations, including cutting 300 job
in March and 375 more in June.  “The wireless improvement continues,” said Drew McReynolds, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.  The carrier’s average monthly revenue from both customers
on contracts and prepaid clients, who typically look for cheaper
calling plans, was little changed at C$61.92 ($62.45) during the
quarter, beating McReynolds’ C$61.20 estimate.  The gain in average revenue “represents a solid
improvement” over declines in the past several quarters, said
McReynolds. He rates Rogers the equivalent of a buy.  Third-quarter profit rose to 96 Canadian cents a share, the
Toronto-based company said today in a statement, excluding
stock-based compensation expenses and restructuring and
acquisition costs. That beat the average estimate of 89 cents
from analysts’ predictions compiled by Bloomberg.  Operating Costs  While equipment costs and customer retention spending both
climbed last quarter, other operating expenses dropped 4.4
percent to C$667 million, Rogers said.  Sales gained 1.4 percent to C$3.18 billion. Analysts
anticipated C$3.16 billion on average. Net income declined 5.1
percent to C$466 million, or 90 cents a share, compared with
C$491 million, or 87 cents, a year earlier.  Rogers is the first of the big three Canadian carriers to
report third-quarter earnings. BCE and Telus, which have
narrowed the gap with Rogers in total wireless subscribers in
recent quarters, are scheduled to report earnings Nov. 1 and
Nov. 9, respectively.  Rogers added 76,000 subscribers with contracts, the long-
term customers who typically buy a smartphone and spend more on
data, below Yaghi’s estimate of 85,000. McReynolds predicted BCE
will add 120,000 postpaid subscribers, and Telus, 129,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
