Greece ’s 10-year yields erased their
biggest increase in a month as lawmakers gave conflicting
messages about whether the nation had won more time to reduce
its deficit.  Spanish 10-year securities rose for the first time in four
days as the Greek securities rebounded. German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he had “no new knowledge” of a
possible extension to Greece’s budget deadline, after Greek
Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras told lawmakers in  Athens  a
two-year extension had been achieved. Germany attracted bids for
more than its maximum target at a 10-year debt sale.  “There’s some positive news in the market and although
it’s being denied, Greek bonds appear to be assuming there is no
smoke without fire,” said  Peter Chatwell , a strategist at
Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “The
common view is that Greece’s debt is beyond the point of
sustainability so some form of debt relief has to materialize.
So the reports strike a chord with that way of thinking.”  The yield on 10-year Greek bonds fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 17.02 percent at 4:47 p.m. London
time after rising as much as 75 basis points to 17.79 percent,
the biggest jump since Sept. 24. The 2 percent security maturing
in February 2023 rose 0.095, or 95 euro cents per 1,000-euro
($1,296) face amount, to 32.8.  Manufacturing, Services  Greek and Spanish bonds earlier dropped after reports added
to evidence the regional debt crisis is slowing growth.  A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in manufacturing and services in the euro area fell to 45.8 in
October from 46.1 the previous month, London-based Markit
Economics said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast an
increase to 46.5. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds fell five basis points
to 5.58 percent after rising as much as seven basis points to
5.69 percent.  Germany ’s 10-year bond yield was little changed at
1.56 percent  Germany’s debt agency received bids of 5.06 billion euros
for the September 2022 bonds it auctioned today, surpassing its
maximum target for the sale of 4 billion euros. The securities
were allotted at an average yield of 1.56 percent, versus 1.52
percent at the prior sale on Sept. 26.  The head of  Europe ’s permanent rescue fund, Klaus Regling,
said it still had 28 billion euros of the 32 billion euros paid
in so far to invest by the end of November.  ESM Purchases  The European Stability Mechanism has invested 4 billion
euros in “highly rated” government bonds and the debt of
international institutions, Regling said yesterday in a
Bloomberg Television interview in Luxembourg. The ESM became
operational on Oct. 8 and will rely on paid-in capital by
European governments to underpin its firepower of 500 billion
euros.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in the euro-
region markets today, followed by  Portugal , according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two-and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  German bonds returned 2.5 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities rose 2.6 percent, while Italy’s made 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
