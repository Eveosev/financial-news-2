Punch Taverns (PUB) , which owns more than
4,500 U.K. pubs, is in discussions with shareholders as it
prepares to restructure 2.4 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) of
mortgage-backed bonds, it said today in an earnings statement.  The Staffordshire, England-based company has two bond
issues that would need to be restructured “to protect the
material financial and operational benefits that both enjoy” as
part of the Punch group, according to the statement.  “Discussions have been initiated with certain major
shareholders and other significant stakeholders to seek their
input on the range of possible options available to restructure
the securitizations,” Punch said.  The company reported earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of 238 million pounds in the year
ending Aug. 18, lower than last year’s 258 million pounds. It
sold 475 pubs over the year. Punch rose 2 percent to 6.55 pence
at 11:00 a.m. in  London .  Punch Taverns began restructuring its business last year to
cope with falling sales and high debt levels. Advised by
Blackstone Group LP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., it spun off
its Spirit division in August 2011 and has said it wants to cut
its ownership to 3,000 outlets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
