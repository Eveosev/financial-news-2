Cool Planet Energy Systems , a
biofuels maker backed by  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  General Electric Co. (GE)  and
 BP Plc (BP/) , plans to build 30 manufacturing plants within three
years to make gasoline, according to Chief Executive Officer
Howard Janzen.  The company uses a chemical-mechanical process to convert
biomass such as corncobs, grass and non-food crops into fuel for
about $1.50 a gallon, Janzen said in an interview yesterday.  Google tested the fuel in a vehicle at its Mountain View,
California, headquarters, according to a statement today from
Camarillo, California-based Cool Planet.  Cool Planet has contractual agreements to sell $500 million
of fuel, so there’s “a home for this product already,” said
Janzen. Instead of large plants that take years to receive
permits and build, Cool Planet wants to mass-produce small
refineries that may be delivered in multiple, shipping-
container-sized modules, Janzen said.  The mobile facilities can produce about 10 million gallons
of fuel a year and the company is aiming to build 400 such
plants within seven to eight years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
