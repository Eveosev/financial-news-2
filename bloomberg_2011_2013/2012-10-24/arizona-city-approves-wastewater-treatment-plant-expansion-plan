Arizona  city officials in Prescott
approved a wastewater plant expansion plan that will cost at
least $35.3 million, with construction to begin this month and
continue for two years.  The sewage plant improvements near Prescott’s airport will
boost the plant’s capacity from its current 1.2 million gallons
a day to 3.75 million gallons daily when completed in 2014,.
City officials said costs for the upgrades and repairs when done
may be higher if including engineering design work, land
acquisition and easements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
