Automatic Data Processing Inc.’s
monthly U.S.  payroll estimate  will be calculated using a larger
sample of its customers, the Roseland, New Jersey-based provider
of human resource applications said today.  The number of corporate customers included in its
calculations will increase to 406,000 from 344,000, according to
a press release. Those companies employ 23 million workers, or
more than 20 percent of all non-government staff, the company
said.  ADP (ADP)  also announced it will partner with Moody’s Analytics
Inc. in  West Chester , Pennsylvania, to produce the report
starting with the next release on Nov. 1. The company previously
collaborated with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC of  St. Louis .  The data will also include a more detailed breakdown by
company size and industries. Figures for businesses employing
one to 19 workers, 20 to 49, 50 to 499, 500 to 999 and 1,000 or
more will now be included, ADP said.  The industries covered will be expanded to five, including
construction, financial activities, manufacturing, professional
and business services and trade, transportation and utilities.  In addition, ADP and Moody’s Analytics said they developed
a new methodology that will better align the data to the
Department of Labor’s payroll figures, the press release said
without describing the changes. The government’s next employment
report will be released on Nov. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
