European Union regulators referred
Italy back to court over its failure to clean up illegal
landfills and is seeking daily fines against the country.  “Despite an earlier court judgment on this matter in April
2007, problems still persist in almost all Italian regions and
the measures in place are not sufficient to resolve the problem
in the long term,” the European Commission, the EU regulator in
Brussels, said today in a statement.  The EU referred Italy back to the  European Court  of Justice
and is requesting a lump-sum fine of 56 million euros ($72.5
million) and a daily penalty payment of 256,819 euros for each
day of noncompliance after a second court ruling, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
