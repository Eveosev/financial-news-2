Turkey ’s two-year note  yields 
extended a 21-month low as central bank Governor Erdem Basci
said he’d keep cutting funding costs to banks and analysts
speculated Fitch Ratings will upgrade the country’s debt.  Yields on benchmark two-year bonds dropped 5 basis points
to 7.17 percent at the close in Istanbul, the lowest since Jan.
12, 2011. Turkish markets closed for a national holiday at 12:30
p.m. and will reopen on Oct. 30. Today’s drop in yields extended
the fall to 41 basis points this month and 384 basis points this
year, the biggest decrease in major  emerging markets  worldwide.  The central bank can cut its  cost of funding  to Turkish
banks to 5.5 percent from 5.72 percent, Basci said in a press
conference in Istanbul today following the bank’s quarterly
inflation assessment. Fitch holds a half-day conference on
Turkey’s credit outlook on Nov. 8.  “The market is definitely trying to price some positive
ratings news from Fitch in November,” Sengul Dagdeviren, chief
economist at ING Bank AS in Istanbul, said by e-mail yesterday.
“Current pricing of both bonds and equities are benefiting.”  Paul Rawkins , a senior director at Fitch, said Oct. 10 in
 London  that Turkey’s junk rating would be reviewed by year-end
and that the country’s growth is consistent with a lower
 inflation  rate and  current-account deficit .  Fitch ranks Turkey’s debt at BB+, the highest non-
investment grade status, with a stable outlook. Moody’s
Investors Service gives the country an equivalent Ba1 ranking,
with Standard & Poor’s rates the debt one step lower at BB.  The  ISE National 100 stocks index  slipped less than 0.1
percent to close at 70,708.41 today, trimming this month’s gain
to 6.5 percent. The lira declined 0.3 percent today to 1.8072
per dollar at 2:30 p.m. in Istanbul, paring its gain this year
to 4.6 percent.  The central bank raised its year-end inflation estimate to
7.4 percent from 6.2 percent, Basci said today, bringing it in
line with estimates announced Oct. 9 in the government’s medium-
term economic plan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
