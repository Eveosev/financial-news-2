The  Columbus Blue Jackets  named
former  New York  Rangers goaltender and television analyst John Davidson as the team’s president after posting the  National
Hockey League ’s worst record last season.  Davidson, 59, spent the past six years in the same role
with the  St. Louis Blues , helping guide the team last season to
a 49-22-11 mark, the best in the Western Conference’s Central
Division. The Blues had the fewest points in the NHL the season
before Davidson’s hiring.  After the Blues were eliminated from this year’s playoffs
by the Stanley Cup-champion Los Angeles Kings in the second
round, the Blues bought out the remainder of Davidson’s
contract.  The Blue Jackets finished last season with a league-worst
29-46-7 record and have qualified for the playoffs once since
joining the NHL in 2000.  An NHL goaltender from 1973 to 1983 for the Blues and
Rangers, Davidson had been lead analyst for Rangers games on
Madison Square Garden Network since 1986 before taking the
management job with the Blues. He was inducted into the Hockey
Hall of Fame as a broadcaster in 2009.  The NHL’s 2012-13 season is in jeopardy of being canceled
with the league and its players in the midst of a labor dispute.
No talks are scheduled after the league rejected three contract
proposals from the NHL Players’ Association on Oct. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
