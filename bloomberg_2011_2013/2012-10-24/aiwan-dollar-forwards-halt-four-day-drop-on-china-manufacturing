Taiwan dollar  forwards halted a
four-day slide after a survey indicated a manufacturing slump is
easing in  China , the island’s largest export market.  The contracts reached a two-week low earlier as
international funds sold $121 million more  Taiwan  stocks than
they bought today, according to exchange data. The preliminary
reading for China’s purchasing managers’ index released by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today was 49.1, compared with
a final reading of 47.9 last month. September’s result was the
11th straight month below 50, the dividing line between
expansion and contraction.  “I expect the improvement in China’s flash PMI to add to
the Taiwan dollar’s strength,” said Connie Tse, a regional
economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore .  One-month non-deliverable forwards traded at NT$29.245 as
of 4:08 p.m. in Taipei, compared with NT$29.25 yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts touched
NT$29.29 earlier, the weakest level since Oct. 11, and are at a
0.3 percent premium to the spot rate.  In the  spot market , the Taiwan dollar closed at NT$29.342
against its U.S. counterpart, compared with NT$29.328 yesterday,
data from Taipei Forex Inc. showed. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to
3.55 percent.  Taiwan’s central bank has intervened to stem advances in
the currency in the final minutes of trading on most days in the
past five months, according to traders who asked not to be
identified. The currency fell 0.05 percent today, having been
0.1 percent stronger two minutes before the 4 p.m. close.  The yield on the government’s 2 percent bonds due July 2017
held at 0.879 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.
The  overnight interbank lending  rate was also steady at 0.389
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
