Wheat rose in  Chicago  on a report
that Ukraine confirmed a ban on exports of the grain after dry
weather and accelerating demand cut supplies.  Shipments will be barred as of Nov. 15, Reuters reported
today, citing Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk. Exports
may reach 5.3 million metric tons next month, a point that
threatens to exhaust Ukraine’s exportable surplus, the
government said Oct. 19. Drought may cut combined wheat harvests
in Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan by 37 percent this year,
helping send global stockpiles to a four-year low, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates.  “The supply-and-demand balance is very tight,” Arnaud
Saulais, a broker at Starsupply Commodity Brokers in Nyon,
Switzerland, said by telephone. “Long term, we’re still in a
situation that should keep prices high.”  Wheat for December delivery added 0.5 percent to $8.735 a
bushel at 7:10 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are up
34 percent this year. In Paris, January-delivery milling wheat
rose 0.6 percent to 264 euros ($341) a ton on NYSE Liffe after
reaching 264.25 euros, the highest price since Oct. 11.  The USDA estimated Oct. 11 Ukraine’s wheat exports in the
2012-13 season would be the lowest in five years at 4 million
tons. Global inventories before next year’s Northern Hemisphere
harvest may drop to 173 million tons, 13 percent lower than the
previous season, according to the USDA.  Wheat almost doubled in 2010 in Paris trading and climbed
47 percent in Chicago after a drought spurred  Russia  to halt
exports for 10 months and Ukraine to restrict shipments. Russia,
whose government has said production this year may be lower than
in 2010, may have no need to limit exports in the current
season, President Vladimir Putin said Oct. 10.  Ukraine exported 3.8 million tons of wheat since the
current season started July 1 and outstanding contracts total
5.4 million tons, the Agriculture Ministry said today. Ukraine
has enough milling wheat to meet domestic needs in the season
and for reserves, it said.  Soybeans for January delivery gained 0.6 percent to
$15.6475 a bushel in Chicago. Corn for December delivery added
0.2 percent to $7.5725 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
