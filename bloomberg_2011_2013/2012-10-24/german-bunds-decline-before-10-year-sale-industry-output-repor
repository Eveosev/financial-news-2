Spain ’s government bonds fell for a
fourth day, the longest losing streak in three months, after
euro-area services and manufacturing shrank more than economists
forecast and German business confidence declined.  Italian, Greek and Portuguese securities dropped as the
reports added to evidence the region’s financial woes are
slowing growth, damping demand for the debt of so-called
peripheral nations. German bunds were little changed after the
nation attracted bids for more than its maximum target at a 10-
year debt sale. The head of  Europe ’s permanent rescue fund said
it still had 28 billion euros ($36.3 billion) of the 32 billion
euros paid in so far to invest by the end of November.  Bonds of the most-indebted nations fell “because the weak
data today highlighted the risk that the crisis could
deteriorate further,” said  Matteo Regesta , a senior interest-
rate strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  London . “Germany, which is
a locomotive of growth in the euro region, is slowing and that
is not good news for peripheral bonds. It needs growth to get
out of the problem.”  Spain’s 10-year yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.65 percent at 1:54 p.m. London time after
climbing to 5.69 percent, the highest since Oct. 17. The 5.85
percent bond due in January 2022 fell 0.185, or 1.85 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 101.38.  The four-day decline is the longest since July 24, two days
before European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy
makers will do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro.  Composite Index  A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in manufacturing and services in the euro area fell to 45.8 in
October from 46.1 the previous month, London-based Markit
Economics said. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a
reading of 46.5. A level below 50 indicates contraction. The Ifo
institute in Munich said its business climate index dropped to
100 this month, the lowest since February 2010.  Italian two-year yields rose five basis points to 2.28
percent,  Portugal ’s 10-year rate climbed 25 basis points to 8.03
percent, and  Greece ’s 10-year yield increased five basis points
to 17.09 percent.  The European Stability Mechanism has invested 4 billion
euros in “highly rated” government bonds and the debt of
international institutions, Klaus Regling, head of the ESM, said
yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview in Luxembourg.  “We will have the entire stock of 32 billion euros
invested by the end of November,” he said.  German Auction  Germany’s debt agency received bids for 5.06 billion euros
of September 2022 bonds at today’s auction, surpassing its
maximum target of 4 billion euros. The securities were sold at
1.56 percent, up from 1.52 percent at the previous auction on
Sept. 26.  Germany ’s  10-year yield  was little changed at 1.57 percent
in the secondary market after dropping to 1.55 percent, the
lowest since Oct. 17.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-
region markets today, followed by Ireland, according to measures
of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread between two-
and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  German bonds returned 2.5 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities rose 2.6 percent, while Italy’s made 17 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
