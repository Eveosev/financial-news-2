U.S. stocks were little changed,
after yesterday’s decline, as a slump in technology shares
tempered signs that a slump in China’s factory output is easing
and America’s housing market is improving.  D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI)  and  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  added at least 1.8
percent to pace gains in homebuilders.  Facebook Inc. (FB) , the
biggest social networking site, surged 21 percent after
reporting sales that topped analysts’ estimates.  Boeing Co. (BA)  rose
1.3 percent after boosting its full-year forecast for the third
time this year.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  fell 0.1 percent, reversing a rally
of as much as 2.2 percent.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  plunged 14 percent as it
cut its  forecast  for domestic growth.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell less than 0.1 percent
to 1,412.74 at 11:56 a.m. New York time. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  increased 12.62 points, or 0.1 percent, to
13,115.15. Trading in S&P 500 companies was about 4.1 percent
lower than the 30-day average at this time of day.  “The market was encouraged by signs of stabilization in
China, and the better-than-expected home sales data in U.S.
suggest that the housing recovery remains in track,” said  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management in
Richmond, Virginia, which oversees about $47 billion. He spoke
in a phone interview. “Yet the market is still struggling,
trying to determine the damage in corporate profits growth.”  Equities gained as a survey signaled a smaller contraction
in China’s manufacturing. Purchases of  new homes  in the U.S.
rose in September to the highest level in more than two years.
The Federal Open Market Committee will conclude a two-day
meeting in Washington today and release a statement on policy.  Earnings Season  Forty-four companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to
release results today. Earnings at about 70 percent of the
index’s companies beat analysts’ estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Third-quarter sales  missed  forecasts at
60 percent of companies, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, the data showed.  Concern about a worsening of the earnings picture has sent
the  S&P 500 (SPX)  down 3.6 percent from this year’s high on Sept. 14.
The decline has extended its  October loss  to 2 percent after the
index capped four straight months of gains. The benchmark
measure is still up 12 percent in 2012 on speculation central
bankers will keep economies expanding.  Six out of  10 groups  in the S&P 500 rose as financial,
health-care and raw material shares had the biggest gains.
Technology shares had the biggest declines, losing 0.7 percent.
Apple fell 0.1 percent to $612.94. A measure of 11 homebuilders
in S&P indexes added 1.3 percent.  D.R. Horton  advanced 1.8
percent to $21.47. Toll Brothers increased 2.2 percent to
$35.30.  Facebook’s Results  Facebook surged 21 percent to $23.55. Ads delivered to
people on mobile devices generated about $150 million during the
quarter, or 14 percent of all advertising revenue. That compares
with about $10 million in the second quarter, according to an
estimate by  Brian Wieser , an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.
The shares were raised to buy from hold at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.  Boeing added 1.3 percent to $73.73. The company also
reported quarterly earnings that  topped  estimates amid higher
deliveries of commercial and military aircraft.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  jumped 6.8 percent to $30.50. The chemical
producer reported better-than-expected earnings. Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Liveris  said yesterday he’s
cutting jobs and closing plants at the biggest U.S. chemical
maker because global economic growth is slowing.  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  increased 3 percent to $94.67. The
world’s largest defense contractor said third-quarter profit
rose 9.3 percent and raised its full-year earnings  forecast . The
company also projected a decline in 2013 sales.  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  jumped 1.8 percent to $12.31. The
carrier that wants to merge with American Airlines said third-
quarter profit more than  doubled  as passenger traffic increased
and the price it paid for jet fuel declined.  Better Results  Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH)  rallied 12 percent to $25.53. The
insurer specializing in Medicaid plans for the poor reported a
profit on improved results from its biggest market.  Netflix plunged 14 percent to $58.49. The world’s largest
online video service cut its forecast for domestic growth and
predicted larger losses from international expansion.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  fell 0.9 percent to $32.93. The
only drugmaker among the top 12 to decline in trading this year
reported sales and earnings trailed analyst estimates after
revenue from its top medicine vanished to generic competition.  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  lost 2.8 percent to $50.48 after reporting
third-quarter earnings that missed analyst  estimates  after
generic competition reduced revenue from the schizophrenia
treatment Zyprexa, once the company’s top-selling drug.  Tempur-Pedic International Inc. plunged 21 percent to
$25.20. The mattress maker acquiring rival Sealy Corp. cut its
2012 profit forecast amid increased U.S. competition and
weakening sales in Europe.  Dining Chains  Brinker International Inc. (EAT)  sank 9.8 percent to $30.17. The
owner of the Chili’s and Maggiano’s dining chains forecast
profit that was less than analysts estimated.  Two  New York Times Co. (NYT)  option trades pushed bearish wagers
to the  highest level ever  after the publisher of the third-
biggest U.S. newspaper by weekday circulation rallied to a 20-
month peak.  The ratio of outstanding  puts  to sell the stock versus
calls increased almost 30-fold in two days to 4.1-to-1 on Oct.
22, an all-time high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
block of 8,500 January $10 puts changed hands that day after
10,000 traded at the end of last week, the data show. Times
Co.’s shares  climbed  37 percent this year through yesterday and
touched its highest price since February 2011 last week.  “The stock has had a nice run which you may want to
hedge,” Boniface “Buzz” Zaino, a money manager at Royce &
Associates LLC in New York, said yesterday via phone. His firm
manages about $36 billion including shares of the publisher.
“You could get a near-term bearish case based on concerns about
the economy for the next six months and what’s going to happen
to advertising dollars.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
