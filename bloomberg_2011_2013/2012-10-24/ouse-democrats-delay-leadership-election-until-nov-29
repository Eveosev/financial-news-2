U.S. House Democrats will delay the
election of their leaders for the 2013-14 session until Nov. 29,
according to a Democratic leadership aide.  Parties typically elect leaders as soon as Congress returns
to Washington after the November elections. This year that would
be the week of Nov. 12, when Republicans plan to hold their
leadership elections.  House Democratic leader  Nancy Pelosi  of California hasnâ€™t
committed to running again for the top spot. When asked about
her leadership plans during a telephone interview Oct. 22,
Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said she would serve out the new
two-year term she is seeking in the Nov. 6 election. Pelosi has
previously given the same answer when asked about her plans.  The only currently contested position among Democratic
leadership is for the fifth-ranking job of caucus vice chairman.
Among the lawmakers who have expressed an interest are Joe Crowley of New York,  Jared Polis , the founder of Proflowers.com
from Colorado, and Barbara Lee of California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
