OAO Gazprom Neft, the liquids arm of
 Russia â€™s natural-gas exporter, finished building a hydrocracking
unit to boost the quality of diesel from its Omsk plant.  The unit is able to produce 3 million metric tons of so-
called Euro-5 diesel a year, Gazprom Neft said in a statement
today on its website. The company spent a 15.9 billion rubles
($508 million) to build the hydrocracking unit and an earlier
facility that was started this year, allowing all Omsk motor
fuels to meet Euro-4 and Euro-5 specifications in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
