Vietnam ’s one-year bonds fell after
inflation accelerated more than economists forecast, limiting
the scope for policy makers to reduce  interest rates . The dong
was little changed.  Consumer prices  rose 7 percent in October from a year
earlier, the most since May, according to data released by the
General Statistics Office in Hanoi today. The median of four
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 6.75 percent
increase. The economy has failed to expand by more than 5
percent in each of the first three quarters of this year, after
growing 5.9 percent in 2011, official data show.  “This is cutting into the State Bank of Vietnam’s space to
ease monetary policy,” Vincent Conti, an economist at Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore , wrote in a
research note today. “Even as 2012 growth is threatening to
come in slower than the government’s downwardly revised target
of 5.2 percent.”  The yield on the one-year bonds rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 9.25 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest
increase since Oct. 15. The yield on the benchmark five-year 
notes was unchanged at 10.30 percent.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 2:22 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,854 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
