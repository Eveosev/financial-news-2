Harmony Gold Mining Co. said many
workers returned to its Kusasalethu mine in  South Africa  as it
started dismissal procedures against striking employees who
failed to meet the 6 a.m. deadline for resuming their jobs.  “There’s a large percentage of workers returning,”
spokeswoman Marian van der Walt said today in a phone interview.
Dismissal procedures will begin for those not reporting, who
have about 48 hours to appeal against the termination, she said.  The company issued the ultimatum to the strikers at
Kusasalethu, near Carletonville, two days ago after they walked
out on Oct. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
