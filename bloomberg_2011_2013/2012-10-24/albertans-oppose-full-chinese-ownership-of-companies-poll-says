Albertans oppose full Chinese
ownership of companies in the province, and are more open to
allowing investors from the Asian country to hold minority
stakes, according to a poll by the University of Alberta.  Sixty-four percent of Albertans disagreed with the
statement that full ownership by Chinese investors is
acceptable, while 15 percent agreed, according to the poll,
which was released today and commissioned by the University of
Alberta’s China Institute. When asked about partial ownership by
Chinese investors, 36 percent were opposed and 37 percent in
favor.  The results come as the federal government reviews  Cnooc
Ltd.’s (883)  $15.1 billion takeover of  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , a Calgary-based oil
and gas producer.  The telephone survey of 1,210 people was conducted by the
university’s Population Research Lab from July 3 to 18. It has a
margin of error of 2.8 percentage points, the institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
