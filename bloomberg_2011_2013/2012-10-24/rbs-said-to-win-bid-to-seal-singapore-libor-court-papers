Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  won
a bid to seal documents in a lawsuit filed by a former trader
fired over allegations he rigged the  London  interbank offered
rate, according to a person familiar with the decision.  In a closed hearing yesterday, Singapore High Court Justice
Lee Seiu Kin accepted RBS’s request to seal filings made after
Sept. 6 in the lawsuit, according to the person, who asked not
to be identified because the decision hasn’t been made public.
Minutes of the hearing weren’t accessible at the court house
today.  Tan Chi Min, RBS’s former Singapore-based head of Asian
delta trading, sued the bank in December claiming he was
wrongfully dismissed and seeking to recoup $1.5 million in
bonuses and 3.3 million RBS shares that he said he’s owed.  RBS, Britain’s biggest publicly owned bank, is one of at
least a dozen banks being probed over allegations traders
colluded to manipulate global  interest rates  so they could
profit from bets on derivatives. The Edinburgh-based bank had
argued that making the documents publicly accessible may have
“extensive potential prejudice” on the confidential regulatory
investigations.  A spokesman for RBS in London declined to comment.  Tan had accused RBS of trying to find scapegoats for
alleged Libor manipulation, which he said was “common
practice” among senior employees and condoned by the bank.  RBS said in a January court filing that Tan deserved to be
fired because he was guilty of “gross misconduct.”  The case is Tan Chi Min v Royal Bank of Scotland S939/2011.
