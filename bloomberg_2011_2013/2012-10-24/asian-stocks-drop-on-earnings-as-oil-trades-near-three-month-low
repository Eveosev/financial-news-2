U.S. stocks fell, erasing early
gains, and commodities dropped for a third day as the  Federal
Reserve  said growth in employment remains slow and strains in
financial markets continue to pose risks to the economy. Oil
slid to a three-month low after American supplies increased.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to close
at 1,408.75, erasing a 0.5 percent early gain to close at the
lowest level since Sept. 5. Ten-year Treasury yields rose three
basis points to 1.79 percent. Oil dropped for a fifth day,
trading below $86 a barrel, and gasoline extended its longest
slump on record. The euro lost 0.2 percent to $1.2968 after
German manufacturing and business confidence missed estimates.  Earnings reports depicting a slowing global economy dragged
the  S&P 500  to a plunge of more than 3 percent over the three
sessions prior to today, the benchmark gauge’s biggest drop
since June. The Fed’s statement today said the economy is still
growing modestly and unemployment remains elevated as it
maintains $40 billion in monthly purchases of mortgage-backed
securities aimed at spurring the three-year expansion.  “It’s been a pretty lackluster market,” Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion of assets at BB&T Wealth
Management in Birmingham,  Alabama , said in a telephone
interview. “There’s nothing new or encouraging in terms of the
Fed’s outlook regarding the economy. In addition to that, top
line growth of companies has been disappointing.”  Sales Miss  Revenue has trailed estimates at 60 percent of the 187
companies in the S&P 500 that released quarterly results so far
in the earnings season, according to  data c ompiled by Bloomberg.
Sales have increased 1.2 percent for the group while earnings
have declined 0.5 percent.  Stocks rose in early trading as a report signaled America’s
housing market is improving and a survey showed a smaller
contraction in  China ’s  manufacturing , boosting confidence in the
world’s second-biggest economy.  Among U.S. stocks, Corning Inc. tumbled 9.4 percent, the
most since January, after reporting earnings, leading a drop in
technology shares. Netflix Inc. plunged 12 percent as it cut its
forecast for domestic growth.  Facebook Inc. (FB) , the biggest social networking website,
surged 19 percent after reporting sales that topped analysts’
estimates, allaying concerns over its ability to make money from
mobile ads. Dow Chemical Co., the largest U.S. chemical maker by
sales, climbed 4.7 percent after saying it will cut about 2,400
jobs and shut 20 manufacturing plants to reduce annual costs by
$500 million.  Builders Rally  An S&P gauge of 11 homebuilders rallied 1 percent.
 Purchases of new homes  in the U.S. climbed 5.7 percent to a
389,000 annual pace in September, topping the median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey of 75 economists for an increase to 385,000.  The S&P 500 will advance 5 percent to about 1,480 over the
next two weeks before the rally ends and stocks fall, according
to Tom DeMark, the creator of indicators to show turning points
in securities.  The gain would push the benchmark index above the 2012
intraday high of 1,474.51 reached on Sept. 14 before buyers are
exhausted, said DeMark, whose prediction last year that the S&P
500’s decline would stop at 1,076 proved prescient when the
index bottomed at 1,074.77 on Oct. 4, 2011. The advance will
fizzle, with the S&P 500 heading for a potential decline of 12
percent to 17 percent, he said in an e-mailed statement.  ‘Unfinished Business’  “There is still some unfinished business upside that will
totally surprise and shock most market followers,” DeMark, the
founder of Market Studies LLC, wrote. The S&P 500 “rally is a
solo move in a sense that the overall market trend has been down
since Sept. 14,” he wrote.  Three shares advanced for every two that declined in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. SAP AG rallied 4.2 percent after the
biggest maker of business-management software reported third-
quarter software license revenue that beat analyst estimates and
boosted a sales forecast.  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  fell 1.9 percent after the
truckmaker’s third-quarter  profit  missed analyst estimates.  Oil declined 1.1 percent to $85.73 a barrel, the lowest
since July 10, after the U.S. Energy Department said supplies
rose three times as much as expected last week, gaining 5.9
million barrels to 375.1 million. An increase of 1.8 million was
expected. Gasoline slipped 0.2 percent to $2.603 a barrel.  The average nationwide price for  regular gasoline  at the
pump declined 2.3 cents to $3.625 a gallon yesterday, the lowest
since Aug. 5, according to AAA, the largest U.S. motoring
organization.  Euro Weakens  The euro declined against 11 of its 16 major counterparts,
slipping 0.2 percent versus the yen. The Ifo institute in Munich
said its  business climate index , based on a survey of 7,000
executives, dropped to 100.0 this month from 101.4 in September.
Economists had predicted an increase to 101.6, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  Euro-area  services and manufacturing output  contracted more
than economists forecast in October. A composite index based on
a survey of  purchasing managers  fell to 45.8 from 46.1 in
September, London-based Markit Economics said. Economists had
forecast a reading of 46.5, the median of 18 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey showed. A level below 50 indicates contraction.  Europe Risks  “The weak data today highlighted the risk that the crisis
could deteriorate further,” said  Matteo Regesta , a senior
interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  London . “ Germany ,
which is a locomotive of growth in the euro region, is slowing
and that is not good news for peripheral bonds. It needs growth
to get out of the problem.”  The yield on Germany’s 10-year bund decreased two basis
points to 1.56 percent. The government sold 3.33 billion euros
(4.3 billion) of debt due September 2022 after receiving 5.06
billion euros of bids, compared with a maximum 4 billion-euro
target.  The  Hong Kong  Monetary Authority sold the city’s currency
for the second day in a week yesterday to halt appreciation and
maintain a 29-year-old peg to the  U.S. dollar . The currency was
at HK$7.7503 versus the greenback, near the top end of its
allowed trading range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  slipped 0.3 percent, with
gauges in  South Korea ,  Thailand  and the  Philippines  falling at
least 0.6 percent. Russia’s Micex Index lost 0.4 percent, while
the Shanghai Composite Index gained less than 0.1 percent. The
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of companies listed in Hong
Kong and  Hungary ’s BUX Index fell at least 1 percent as trading
resumed after holidays.  To contact the reporters on this story:
