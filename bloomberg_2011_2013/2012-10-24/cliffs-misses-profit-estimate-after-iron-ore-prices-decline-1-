Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) , the
largest U.S. iron-ore producer, reported third-quarter results
that missed analysts’ estimates as the price of the steelmaking
raw-material dropped.  Net income  fell 86 percent to $85.1 million, or 59 cents a
share, from $601.2 million, or $4.15, a year earlier, the
Cleveland-based company said today in a statement. Profit from
continuing operations was 61 cents a share, missing the $1.02
average of 21  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales dropped 30
percent to $1.45 billion.  The price of seaborne  iron ore  fell 36 percent to an
average $112 a metric ton in the quarter, compared with $176 a
year earlier, according to Steel Business Briefing data compiled
by Bloomberg. Cliffs decreased its  outlook  for the spot price of
iron ore this year by 12 percent to $128 a ton from a July
forecast of $145 a ton.  Cash costs in Cliffs’ Canadian division rose 21 percent to
$106.06 a ton. Costs at the Bloom Lake Mine, which Cliffs
acquired with its 2011 purchase of Consolidated Thompson Iron
Ore Mines Ltd., rose 18 percent from a year earlier driven by
higher fuel, labor, maintenance and supply costs, the company
said in the statement.  “That was a shocker on  Canada ,” Laurence Balter, who
oversees $100 million at Oracle Investment Research in Fox
Island,  Washington , said today in a phone interview. “The
increase in cash cost was a little concerning for me.”  Cliffs fell 6.9 percent to $39.76 at 6:29 p.m. after the
close of regular trading in New York.  The shares  declined 32
this year through the close.  U.S. steelmakers used 75 percent of their  capacity  on
average in the third quarter, compared with 76 percent a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from the
American Iron and Steel Institute. Capacity utilization has
tumbled from 81 percent in April to 70 percent on Oct. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
