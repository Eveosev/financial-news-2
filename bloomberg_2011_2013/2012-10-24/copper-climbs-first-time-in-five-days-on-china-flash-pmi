Copper futures fell, capping the
longest slump since August, as a bigger-than-expected
contraction in Euro-area services and manufacturing added to
concern that metals demand will slow.  An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
currency union that uses the euro dropped to the lowest in more
than three years, London-based Markit Economics said today. In
 Germany , the Ifo institute’s business climate index fell in
September. A Bloomberg survey of economists had forecast a rise.  “There are a lot of worries out there about how economies
continue to be very sluggish,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at
Kingsview Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“The overall sentiment in copper is not good, and people are
finding a reason to pull the sell trigger.”  Copper futures for December delivery declined less than 1
percent to settle at $3.568 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the Comex in
 New York , dropping for a fifth straight session, the longest
slump since Aug. 30. Earlier, the price touched $3.5475, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Sept. 7.  Reports showing stronger Chinese manufacturing and higher
sales of new houses in the U.S. failed to lift copper. Signs
that  China’s economy  may grow fast enough to allow the
government to refrain from additional stimulus measures may be
dragging copper lower, Zeman said.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped 0.2 percent to $7,817 a metric ton ($3.55 a
pound). Nickel, zinc and tin advanced, while aluminum and lead
declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
