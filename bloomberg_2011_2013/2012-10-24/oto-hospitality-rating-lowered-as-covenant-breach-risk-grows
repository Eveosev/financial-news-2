Standard & Poor’s  cut the rating on
Moto Hospitality Ltd. by one level to B- as the U.K.’s largest
service station operator gets closer to breaking its loan terms
because of sluggish earnings growth.  After raising 450 million pounds ($722 million) of loans
last year, breathing space on Moto’s debt tests, linked to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
“significantly tightened” even as it invested funds to update
its 59 service stations, S&P said in a report today.  “The downgrade reflects our view that Moto’s liquidity has
significantly deteriorated as a result of the group’s inability
to grow Ebitda over the past few quarters,” London-based S&P
analyst Tim Wells said in the report.  “The company continues to endure reduced  consumer
spending , flat traffic volumes, and reduced demand for fuel due
to higher prices,” according to the report.  A B- rating is six levels lower than investment grade.
S&P’s ranking of Moto’s junior-ranking term loan was also
lowered one level, to CCC.  The company generated Ebitda of 77 million pounds in 2011
and 864 million pounds in sales according to a  regulatory filing 
on June 7 from Equity Partners Infrastructure Co., one of its
shareholders.  “The on-going issues in  Europe  and Euro zone also continue
to affect Moto.” Equity Partners said in the filing. “Given
Moto’s leveraged position potential purchasers may consider any
sale as ‘distressed’.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
