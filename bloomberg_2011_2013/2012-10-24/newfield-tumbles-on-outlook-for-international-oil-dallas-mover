Newfield Exploration Co. (NFX) , the U.S.
oil producer with properties from Utah to  Malaysia , plunged
after saying international production may drop as much as 25
percent next year.  Newfield, based in The Woodlands, Texas,  declined  18
percent to $27.46 at the close in New York, the largest decrease
since Nov. 20, 2008.  Net output is affected by the terms of production-sharing
contracts with partners on some projects, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lee Boothby said during a conference call with
analysts and investors today. Growing production in Malaysia and
higher  oil prices  mean there will be declines in Newfield’s net
share occurring earlier than expected, he said.  “The stock is getting hammered because they talked about
how the international oil volumes could be down up to 25 percent
in 2013, which hit these guys pretty hard,” said  Leo Mariani ,
an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in Austin, Texas, who has an
outperform rating on Newfield shares and owns none.  Net production from operations outside the U.S. is about
36,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, Newfield said in a
statement yesterday.  Malaysia has been one of the keys to recent oil growth, and
volumes from that country are expected to rise 50 percent this
year, Boothby said. Output outside the U.S. is expected to rise
in 2014 and beyond, helped by a new project offshore China, he
said.  The outlook from Newfield may be a “worst-case scenario,”
Mariani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
