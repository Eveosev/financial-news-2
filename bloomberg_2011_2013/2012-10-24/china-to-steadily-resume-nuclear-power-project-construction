China will approve a small number of
nuclear power projects along its coast by 2015 as it seeks to
“steadily” resume normal construction of nuclear power
facilities.  The Asian nation won’t plan for nuclear power projects
inland and will raise entry requirements for the industry,
according to a statement on the central government’s website
that cited a State Council meeting presided over by Premier  Wen
Jiabao .  The government banned new nuclear power projects and
ordered a nationwide inspection of existing plants after an
earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant in
 Japan  and prompted a global review of atomic energy projects.  New plants must be built based on the strictest global
safety standards and equipment must conform to third-generation
safety requirements, the government said in today’s  statement .  The meeting mapped out “immediate and future” planning
for the construction of nuclear power facilities, the statement
said, without specifying when the new plant approvals will
resume.  Nuclear power capacity will reach 40 million kilowatts by
2015, Xinhua News Agency reported today, citing a government
white paper for the energy sector. Currently, nuclear power
accounts for 1.8 percent of the nation’s total power generating
capacity, below the global average of 14 percent, Xinhua
reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
