Treasuries snapped a gain from
yesterday as a government report showed U.S.  new home sales 
increased to a two-year high in September, damping demand for
the safest securities.  The benchmark  10-year yield  rose with the U.S. poised to
sell $35 billion of five-year notes today, the second of three
note auctions this week totaling $99 billion. Federal Reserve
policy makers are forecast to retain plans to buy $40 billion in
mortgage-backed securities each month for an indefinite period.  “Because we are getting supply, we are seeing a concession
in prices,” said Thomas di Galoma, a managing director at
Navigate Advisors LLC, a brokerage for institutional investors
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “All of the data in the last few
weeks have been better than expected and that is giving some
temporary strength in the economy. But the uncertainty of the
election,  Europe  and the fiscal cliff will continue to keep a
lid on rates.”  The 10-year  yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 1.78 percent at 10:38 a.m. New York time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent note due in
August 2022 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 98
20/32. The yield climbed to 1.83 percent Oct. 18, the highest
level since Sept. 18.  Yield Differences  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt, was
2.50 percentage points. The average during the past decade is
2.17 percentage points.  The five-year notes on offer today yielded 0.78 percent in
pre-auction trading, versus 0.647 percent at the previous sale
on Sept. 26. Investors  bid  for 3.06 times the amount of
securities available in September, the most since April. The
results will be announced at 1 p.m. New York time.  The  difference  between five- and 30-year yields narrowed to
2.14 percentage points yesterday, the least in six weeks, making
it less attractive to opt for the longer maturity. The 10-year
average is 1.49 percentage points.  Treasuries advanced yesterday as a decline in shares
spurred demand for the relative safety of government debt. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 1.4 percent to the lowest close
since Sept. 5.  Debt Sale  The U.S. sold $35 billion sale of two-year notes yesterday
and will conclude this week’s supply with a $29 billion seven-
year sale tomorrow.  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co. in  Newport Beach ,  California ,
said in a twitter message that the Fed may announce a target for
economic growth at the end of its policy meeting today, and such
a move “would be reflationary.”  The Fed may switch from its “extended period” language
and adopt a target for gross domestic product “or something
close” today or at its meeting in December, Gross wrote. The
Fed statement is scheduled for 2:15 p.m. New York time.  The central bank at its previous meeting on Sept. 12-13
pledged to keep its benchmark  interest rate  near zero at least
through the middle of 2015.  Charles Evans , president of the Fed
Bank of  Chicago , has said policy makers should promise to keep
rates low until the  unemployment rate  falls to 7 percent, as
long as inflation does not breach 3 percent.  Economic Data  New home sales climbed 5.7 percent to a 389,000 annual
pace, the most since April 2010, following a revised 368,000
rate in August, figures from the Commerce Department showed
today in Washington. The median estimate of 75 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for sales to rise to 385,000.  “The market is reacting to the data, and the data’s been
slightly better for the economy,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed
income in  New York  at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., one of
21 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed. “Five-year
notes are cheaper by about 10 basis points this month. Most
people think the Fed won’t do anything with 13 days until the
election.”  The 10-year yield will increase to 2.06 percent by June 30,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists with the most
recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
