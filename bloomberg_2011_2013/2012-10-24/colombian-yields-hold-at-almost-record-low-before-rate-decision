Colombia’s peso bond yields fell on
speculation the central bank may cut the target lending rate at
this week’s policy meeting.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in May 2022 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 5.99 percent, according to the central bank. It fell
to 5.96 percent on Oct. 19, the lowest level on a closing basis
since the securities were first issued in May.  Twenty-eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the
 overnight lending rate  will remain unchanged after the Oct. 26
meeting, while four expect a reduction to 4.5 percent.  “Traders are cautious ahead of the meeting,” said Marisol
Torres, an analyst at Bogota-based  Helm Bank SA. (PFBHELMB)  “Some expect
another cut this month given the recent unfavorable economic
data.”  Rate decisions will depend on global growth and the
domestic economy, Colombia’s central bank said in minutes of its
Sept. 28 meeting that were published Oct. 12. Policy makers held
the target lending rate at 4.75 percent after two cuts since
June from 5.25 percent.  Industrial production fell 1.9 percent in August, compared
with a median forecast calling for a 1.1 percent increase.
Retail sales rose 1.2 percent that month, trailing the median
projection of a 1.7 percent expansion. Colombia’s exports fell
7.6 percent in August.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  abandoned its Aug. 24
recommendation to bet on gains in the benchmark peso bonds due
July 2024 following a “substantial rally at the long end of the
Colombian curve,” BBVA strategists Alvaro Vivanco and Fernando Palma wrote in a note to clients today. Yields on the peso
securities have fallen 1.54 percentage points this year to 6.06
percent today.  The peso was little changed at 1,816.50 per U.S. dollar
after three straight days of declines. The currency has rallied
6.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
