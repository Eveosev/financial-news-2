(Corrects month in first paragraph.)  Swedish  consumer confidence  fell for
a third month in October as companies cut jobs to cope with
stalling demand from Europe.  The  consumer confidence  index fell to minus 2.9, the lowest
since February, from 2 the previous month, the Stockholm-based
National  Institute of Economic Research  said today. Economists
predicted a reading of 1.7, according to the median of eight
forecasts in a Bloomberg  survey . A  manufacturing confidence 
index fell to minus 16 from a revised minus 11. It was estimated
at minus 12.  Companies including truckmaker  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  and phone company
 TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  have all said they will cut jobs amid weakening
demand from Europe, where countries are cutting spending to
reduce debt. Unemployment rose for a second month to 7.4 percent
in September.  Sweden , which relies on sales abroad for about half of its
output, sends 70 percent of its  exports  to  Europe .  Swedenâ€™s central bank last month cut its  main lending rate 
for a third time since December, citing rising unemployment and
weakening  economic growth , which it predicts will slow to 1.5
percent this year from 3.9 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
