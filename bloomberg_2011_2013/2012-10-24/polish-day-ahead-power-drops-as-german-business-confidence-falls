Polish day-ahead  power declined as
the zloty weakened to a four-week low after an unexpected fall
in  Germany ’s business confidence increased concern that the
economy of  Poland ’s biggest trading partner may shrink.  The power contract dropped 6.7 percent to 177.09 zloty
($55.24) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg. The nation’s currency weakened as much as 0.7 percent
to 4.1547 per euro, the lowest since Sept. 27.  Electricity imports  from Sweden and Ukraine were unchanged
from yesterday at 472 megawatts and 130 megawatts, respectively,
data from grid manager PSE Operator SA show.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  halted a 225-megawatt coal-fed
unit at its Laziska power station for maintenance until Dec. 13,
the company said in a posting on its website. The plant had an
unplanned stop at a 215-megawatt unit which is expected to last
until tomorrow.  Czech day-ahead power  dropped 8.9 percent to 48.66 euros
($63.10) a megawatt-hour while the Slovak and Hungarian
contracts declined 11 percent to 48.81 euros, according to the
countries’ market operators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
