National Express  Group Plc fell the
most in three years after the U.K. coach and train operator said
business in 2013 will be “challenging” as government cutbacks
in its home market and Spain hurt bus-division prospects.  Declining economies and rising fuel costs are “likely to
constrain progress” next year after the company meets earnings
targets in 2012, London-based National Express said today in a
statement. The stock fell as much as 10 percent to 185.5 pence,
the biggest intraday decline since Nov. 11, 2009, in today’s
worst performance on the  FTSE 250 Index. (MCX)   Britain and Spain are in recessions as governments reduce
spending to narrow budget deficits. National Express reported
increases in third-quarter revenue today at all its divisions in
the two countries and  North America , with actions such as fare
cuts helping offset changes in rules or contracts.  “The results today were solid but they highlighted that in
2013 they may not be able to fully replace rail earnings from
the East Anglia franchise,” Alexia Dogani, an analyst at
Liberum Capital Ltd., said by phone. “Today’s update also
highlighted revenue trends have softened, especially in Spain
and U.K. coach, so 2013 consensus estimates are likely to be
reduced.”  National Express was trading down 9.8 percent at 2:34 p.m.
Volume was more than double the three-month daily average.  The company lost its East Anglia rail franchise in the U.K.
in February, reducing its train operations to a single service,
C2C, whose contract expires in 2013. It also runs buses and
coaches in the U.K. and  Spain  and school buses in North America.  Revenue at the U.K. coach business has been held back by
the withdrawal of a government concessionary program for older
long-distance travelers, with 1 million fewer journeys expected
in 2012, National Express said. Austerity pressures in Spain
have led some municipalities to drop contracts, it said.  National Express revenue totaled 2.2 billion pounds ($3.6
billion) last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
