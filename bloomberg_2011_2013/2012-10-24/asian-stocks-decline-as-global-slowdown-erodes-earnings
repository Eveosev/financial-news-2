Asian  stocks  dropped, with the
regional benchmark index heading for its fourth straight loss,
as the global economic slowdown crimps corporate earnings and
after commodities erased this year’s gains.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company,
declined 1.4 percent in Sydney.  Kawasaki Heavy (7012)  Industries Ltd.
sank 5.7 percent in  Tokyo  after the gas-turbine maker said
first-half earnings missed its forecast on slowing sales in
 China  and Europe. Esprit Holdings Ltd. slumped 9.5 percent as
the clothier resumed trading in Hong Kong after saying first-
quarter sales plummeted and announcing plans to raise HK$5.2
billion ($671 million) in a rights offer.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 0.4 percent to 122.08
as of 5:48 p.m. in Tokyo, with about two shares falling for each
that advanced on the measure. The gauge rose 13 percent from
this year’s low on June 4 through yesterday as stimulus measures
in the U.S.,  Japan  and China boosted sentiment amid a global
slowdown and Europe’s debt crisis. Spain’s recession will worsen
in coming months, the nation’s central bank said yesterday.  “Weaker earnings from some of America’s biggest companies,
along with a sense that Europe isn’t making good progress on the
debt crisis, has shaken investor confidence,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities
Inc. “After the run-up in markets, we’ve seen, technical
indicators are pointing to some overheating.”  Relative Strength  The regional benchmark gauge posted its biggest weekly
advance in a month last week, with the 14-day  relative strength
index  climbing to 62.7 on Oct. 18, the highest in a month and
closer to the 70 level that traders consider as overbought.
Shares on the Asian gauge traded at 13 times estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with 13.5 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 12 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.7 percent,
reversing gains of as much as 0.3 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
Index slipped 0.7 percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
dropped 0.8 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index lost 0.3 percent.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent, erasing
losses of as much as 0.5 percent. A private survey from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed manufacturing output in
the world’s second-largest economy may contract at a slower pace
this month.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.3 percent,
extending gains for a ninth day, the longest winning streak
since June 2010.  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.3 percent today. The gauge
declined 1.4 percent yesterday in  New York , the lowest closing
level since Sept. 5, amid disappointing earnings results at
companies from 3M Co. to DuPont Co.  Commodities Drop  Energy companies and raw-material producers posted the
biggest decline among the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index. Commodities have erased this year’s advance on
speculation that demand for energy, industrial metals and some
agricultural products will slump because of the sluggish global
economy. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw
materials fell 1.4 percent yesterday in New York.  BHP slipped 1.4 percent to A$34.31 in Sydney.  Rio Tinto
Group (RIO) , the world’s second-largest miner by market value, lost 1
percent A$57.26. Inpex Corp., Japan’s leading energy explorer,
slid 2.1 percent to 468,500 yen in Tokyo.  Kawasaki Heavy decreased 5.7 percent to 166 yen. The
company said in a preliminary earnings statement that operating
profit fell to 10.3 billion yen ($129 million), missing its
estimate by 49 percent, in the six months ended Sept. 30.  Posco, Esprit  Posco dropped 1.4 percent to 343,500 won in Seoul after
Asia’s third-largest steelmaker cut sales forecast for the third
time this year as quarterly profit missed estimates.  Esprit tumbled 9.5 percent to HK$11.26 as trading resumed
in Hong Kong following a holiday yesterday. The company on Oct.
22 said sales fell 23 percent in the quarter ended September and
that it will offer investors the right to buy one new share at
HK$8 each for every two held.  Of the 74 companies on the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  that
posted quarterly results since Oct. 1, 58 percent missed analyst
estimates, according to  data  compiled by  Bloomberg News .  Among stocks that advanced, SK Hynix Inc. climbed 4.1
percent to 24,000 won in Seoul after the world’s second-largest
maker of computer memory chips reported its first profitable
quarter in four on lower costs and currency gains.  Air China Ltd. jumped 5.9 percent to HK$5.43 after the
nation’s biggest carrier by market value scrapped a planned
share sale because of “uncertainty.”  UEM Land Holdings Bhd. (ULHB)  surged 11 percent to 2.15 ringgit in
 Kuala Lumpur  after the Malaysian property developer signed a
deal with Singapore’s Ascendas Land International Pte to jointly
