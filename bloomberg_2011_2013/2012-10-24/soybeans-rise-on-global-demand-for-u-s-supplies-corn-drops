Soybeans rose to a three-week high
on signs of improving demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s largest grower last year. Corn declined.  U.S. exporters sold 105,000 metric tons of soybeans for
delivery before Aug. 31 to unknown destinations, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today.  China , the world’s biggest
buyer, boosted imports by 20 percent in September from a year
earlier with U.S. shipments almost four times higher than a year
earlier, the Customs Administration reported today.  “Export business continues to be very good for soybeans,”
Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “There
appears to be no slowdown in Chinese demand.”  Soybean futures for January delivery gained 1.1 percent to
close at $15.7225 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after reaching $15.77, the highest since Oct. 1. The
price touched $14.8575 on Oct. 15, the lowest since July 3.  Soybean-meal futures for December delivery rose 1.2 percent
to $481.90 for 2,000 pounds on the CBOT, capping the first six-
day gain since July 20.  U.S. export sales for delivery in the marketing year that
began Sept. 1 are 35 percent higher than at the same time a year
earlier, the  USDA  said Oct. 18. U.S. supply on Aug. 31 is
forecast to drop to 4.4 percent of domestic use and exports, the
smallest reserves since 1966. U.S. production was estimated by
the government at the lowest since 2008 after the worst drought
since 1956 reduced Midwest yields.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 0.2 percent to
$7.545 a bushel on the CBOT, the third straight drop. The price
has tumbled 11 percent from a record $8.49 on Aug. 10, as demand
slowed and overseas buyers shifted to cheaper grain from other
suppliers.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
