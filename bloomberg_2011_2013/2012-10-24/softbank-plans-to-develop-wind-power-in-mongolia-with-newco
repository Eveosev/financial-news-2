Softbank Corp. (9984) , the Japanese mobile
phone company planning to invest $20 billion in  Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S) , plans to develop wind power projects in Mongolia.  SB Energy Corp., Softbank’s clean energy unit, will set up
a venture with Mongolia’s Newcom LLC as early as this month to
conduct feasibility studies on wind power generation, Naoki
Nakayama, a Softbank spokesman, said by phone today.  Newcom 
invests in clean technology and infrastructure.  The venture will this year examine a site in the Gobi
desert which may have a capacity of as much as 300 megawatts of
wind power, he said. Should Softbank and Newcom decide to build
a wind farm there, operations may start in 2014, according to
the spokesman.  Nakayama declined to confirm a Nikkei report today that the
project will cost about 50 billion yen ($626 million). The
venture is also considering three more sites in the Gobi, he
said, adding that the four sites could have a total capacity of
more than 7,000 megawatts.  Softbank President Masayoshi Son has been investing in
renewable energy after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Son is
also promoting an “Asia Super Grid” plan to connect power
grids from  India  to  Tokyo  to allow for stable power supply and
boost the use of renewable energy in the region.  “This venture is the first step for the Asia Super Grid
plan as Mongolia has the potential to become an energy supply
station,” Nakayama said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
