Corporate bond risk rose in  Europe 
for a fifth day as German business confidence unexpectedly fell
to the lowest in more than 2 1/2 years.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose four
basis points to 526 at 11:57 a.m. in  London , extending the
longest streak of increases since May. PSA Peugeot Citroen’s
ailing finance unit led bond climbers in Europe after winning 7
billion euros ($9 billion) of French government guarantees.  The sovereign debt crisis is damping growth in Europe’s
largest economy, pushing the Ifo institute’s September business
climate index down to 100.0 from 101.4 in the sixth straight
decline. Comunidad de  Madrid , the regional government for the
Spanish capital, said yesterday it postponed a bond sale until
market conditions improve.  “One of the only bright spots in European growth has been
 Germany ,” said Harpreet Parhar, a strategist at Credit Agricole
SA in London. “It’s seen as the engine of growth, so if
Germany’s weak, the eurozone as a whole is going to
disappoint.”  Banque PSA Finance’s 6 percent notes due 2015 rose 0.45
cent to 103.15 cents on the euro, the biggest increase in Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s EMU Corporates Non-Financial Index.
The yield, which moves inversely to the price, fell 32 basis
points to 4.17 percent.  Credit-default swaps on Peugeot rose for a fifth day,
climbing one basis point to 780, the highest since Oct. 15 and
the longest streak since Feb. 13. An increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Swaps Steady  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was unchanged at 128 basis points.  The cost of insuring against default on European financial
debt was little changed, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index
linked to senior debt of 25 banks and insurers up one basis
point at 172 and the subordinated index down one at 303.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
