Gold futures may slump to $1,600 an
ounce by the end of the year, according to technical analysis by
Paul Kavanaugh at FuturePath Trading LLC.  The contract for December delivery settled below its 50-day
moving average for the second straight day, signaling the metal
may slide 6 percent from yesterday’s closing price of $1,701.60
on the Comex in New York, Kavanaugh, the Chicago-based director
of business development, said in a telephone interview.  “The downside risks are growing, and prices have peaked
for this year,” said Kavanaugh, who correctly predicted in
early April that the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw
materials would slump by the end of the second quarter. “Gold
will correct further.”  Yesterday, the metal touched $1,698.70, breaching $1,700
for the first time since Sept. 7. The 50-day moving average is
$1,726.55. In October, gold has declined 4.1 percent, heading
for the first drop since May.  The price has advanced 8.6 percent this year, heading for
the 12 straight annual gain, as economic stimulus by the U.S.,
 Europe  and  Japan  spurred demand for the metal as an inflation
hedge. This month, gold has averaged $1,755.28, the highest
since September 2011, when the commodity surged to an intraday
record of $1,923.70.  This year’s high was $1,798.10 on Oct. 5.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
