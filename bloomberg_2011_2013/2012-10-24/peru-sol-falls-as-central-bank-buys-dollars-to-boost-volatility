Peru ’s sol fell to a one-week low as
German business confidence sank and the central bank increased
the price it paid for dollars in the  spot market .  The sol depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5840 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The central bank bought $60 million in the spot market and
said on its website it paid 2.5833 soles per dollar, compared
with 2.5819 yesterday. The central bank is buying U.S. currency
every day as part of its strategy to increase sol volatility and
slow growth in dollar-denominated loans, said  Mario Guerrero , an
economist at Scotiabank Peru.  “In the last two days the central bank has bought dollars,
even though the sol hasn’t been strengthening,” Guerrero said.
“It’s created a bit more volatility intraday.”  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.53 percent, according to Bloomberg
prices. The price rose 0.5 cent to 149 cents per dollar.  German business confidence dropped to the lowest in more
than 2 1/2 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
