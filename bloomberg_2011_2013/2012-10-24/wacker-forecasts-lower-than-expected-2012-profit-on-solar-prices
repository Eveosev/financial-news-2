Wacker Chemie AG, the fourth biggest
marker of polysilicon, forecast full-year profit and sales below
analysts’ prediction as competition from Chinese makers of solar
products depresses prices.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will probably be about 750 million euros ($974
million) in 2012, the Munich-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected 804
million euros. Wacker fell to the lowest since the company’s
initial public offering in April 2006.  Many customers in  Europe  are “rather cautious and hesitant
about placing orders,” Wacker said in the statement. The
company, which already cut full-year goals in July, has
introduced shorter working weeks for about 650 of the 1,000
employees at its German Burghausen polysilicon site.  “Sustained price competition, high inventories, the
difficult financial situation of many market players and the
anti-dumping proceedings against Chinese solar manufacturers
currently characterize our polysilicon business,” Chief
Executive Officer Rudolf Staudigl said in today’s statement.  Wacker declined as much as 80 cents, or 1.8 percent, to
43.55 euros in Frankfurt trading, their lowest since April 2006.
The stock traded at 43.70 euros as of 9:34 a.m. The stock has
lost 30 percent this year, cutting the company’s market value to
2.28 billion euros.  Sales for the year will probably be 4.6 billion euros to
4.7 billion euros, Wacker said.  Analysts (WCH)  predicted 4.72 billion
euros. Third-quarter operating profit dropped 36 percent to
204.3 million euros, missing a 217.6 million-euro analyst
estimate. Quarterly sales fell 6.2 percent to 1.20 billion
euros, also missing estimates.  While Wacker’s chemical divisions managed to boost earnings
and sales in the quarter, it wasn’t enough to make up for the
slump at the polysilicon business, the manufacturer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
