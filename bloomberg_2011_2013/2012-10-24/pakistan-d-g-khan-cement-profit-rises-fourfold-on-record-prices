D.G. Khan Cement Ltd. (DGKC) , Pakistan’s
second-largest producer, reported a fourfold surge in net income
on record prices of the building material.  Net income increased to 1.42 billion rupees ($14.8
million), or 3.23 rupees a share, in the three months ended
Sept. 30, from 355.5 million rupees, or 0.81 rupee a year
earlier, the Lahore-based company said in a filing today. Sales
rose 15 percent to 6.1 billion rupees.  Cement makers have relied on price increases amid stagnant
sales in the past five years, a move that led the country’s
competition commission conduct searches in January this year to
investigate price manipulation. Manufacturers of the building
material were fined 6.3 billion rupees in August 2009 for price
monopoly by the watchdog.  “Cement prices rising to a record saved the day as the
quantity sold remained almost the same,” said Syed Asad Ahmed,
analyst at IGI Finex Securities Ltd. in Karachi. Local prices on
average rose 12 percent to a record 438 rupees per 50 kilogram
bag (110 pounds) in the quarter versus 391 rupees in the same
period last year, IGI’s Ahmed said.  D.G. Khan’s shares rose 1 percent to 52.30 rupees at the
close of trading in Karachi. The stock has rallied 175 percent
this year, compared with a 40 percent gain in the benchmark
KSE100 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
