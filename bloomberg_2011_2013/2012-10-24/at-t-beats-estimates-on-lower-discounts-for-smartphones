AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, beat analysts’ estimates for third-quarter profit as a
crimped supply of iPhone 5 devices reduced the need for handset
discounts given to customers who sign up for contracts.  Net income rose to $3.64 billion, or 63 cents a share, from
$3.62 billion, or 61 cents, a year earlier, Dallas-based AT&T
said today in a statement. Analysts had projected 60 cents a
share on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
dropped 0.1 percent to $31.5 billion, compared with the estimate
of $31.6 billion.  AT&T added 151,000 monthly mobile contract  customers ,
compared with 319,000 added a year earlier. While the decline
hurts sales growth, it means the company didn’t have to dole out
so many subsidies -- the payments that make it easier for
customers to afford the latest phones. The average postpaid
mobile-phone bill increased 2.4 percent to $65.20 as smartphone
users spent more to watch videos and listen to music.  “The industry is going through a big transition from
subscriber growth to a period where pricing is on the rise,”
said Gerard Hallaren, an analyst with Janco Partners Inc. in
 Greenwood Village ,  Colorado .  AT&T fell 0.8 percent to $34.71 at the close in New York.
The stock is up 15 percent this year.  IPhone Supplies  AT&T had been forecast to add 339,000 monthly contract
subscribers, according to the average estimate of eight analysts
polled by Bloomberg. AT&T said today monthly contract subscriber
growth was “impacted by iPhone 5 inventory constraints.”  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  said last month that while it sold 5 million of the new
devices in their first weekend on sale, the tally would’ve been
greater if supplies hadn’t been limited.  “The iPhone inventory issue will balance itself out,”
John Stephens, AT&T’s chief financial officer, said in an
interview today. “It always has in the past. We expect it will
this year.”  AT&T activated 4.7 million iPhones, compared with 2.7
million a year ago. The company also sold 114,000 tablets, a 61
percent decline from the 290,000 tablets sold a year ago.  Bigger Bills  Wireless  margins  narrowed to 40.8 percent. That was down
from second-quarter margin of 45 percent and almost in line with
the 40.7 percent average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of seven
analysts.  AT&T’s increase in the size of wireless bills was lifted by
more people buying data plans. The average revenue per monthly
subscriber rose to $65.20 from $63.69 a year ago. The average
estimate of seven analysts was $65.03, according to the
Bloomberg survey.  Sales from AT&T’s land-line  business  fell 1.6 percent to
$14.8 billion. The carrier lost 42,000 Internet customers, which
AT&T said was due to continued declines in users of older DSL
technology. AT&T added 198,000 U-verse television subscribers,
compared with 176,000 a year earlier.  Excluding the Yellow Pages business, of which AT&T sold a
majority portion earlier this year, earnings were 62 cents a
share compared with a similarly adjusted 59 cents a year ago.
Revenue excluding the Yellow Pages business was $30.4 billion,
little changed from the adjusted level a year ago.  AT&T’s third-quarter capital spending was $4.9 billion,
down 7.5 percent from $5.3 billion a year earlier. The company
now expects total spending to be at the low end of its previous
forecast of $19 billion to $20 billion.  “Our network team and our capital team is doing more with
less,” Stephens said. “We just lowered it now because they are
being so efficient that they are going to end up in the $19 to
$20 billion range.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
