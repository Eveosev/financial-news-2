Coffee producing areas in  Brazil ,
the biggest grower of the bean, will have more rain in the
coming weeks, which should benefit crop development, weather
consulting company Somar Meteoreologia said.  The rain should make the soil more humid, which is expected
to favor the development of the coffee trees that were hurt by a
dry spell that lasted until the first week of October, Somar
said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
