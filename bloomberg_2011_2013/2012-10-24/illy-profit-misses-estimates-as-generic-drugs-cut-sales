Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  reported third-
quarter earnings that missed analyst estimates after generic
competition reduced revenue from the schizophrenia treatment
Zyprexa, once the company’s top-selling drug.  Earnings excluding one-time items of 79 cents were 5 cents
less than the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net income rose 7.3 percent to $1.33 billion, or
$1.18 a share, helped by an acquisition-related payment from
Bristol-Myers Squibb & Co., Indianapolis-based Lilly said today
in a statement.  Revenue fell 11 percent to $5.44 billion, $181 million
lower than analysts’ average estimate, as generic copies took
sales from schizophrenia treatment Zyprexa, which lost patent
protection last October. Chief Executive Officer  John Lechleiter 
has said profit won’t grow again until after 2014 as the company
prepares for more drugs losing patent protection.  “Lilly reported a ho-hum quarter,” said  Mark Schoenebaum ,
an analyst with ISI Group in  New York , in a note to clients.
“Marginally weak financial quarter, but nothing terrible.”  Lilly fell 2.7 percent to $50.50 at the close in New York.
The shares have climbed 33 percent over the past 12 months on
study results for the company’s experimental Alzheimer’s
treatment solanezumab.  Reaffirms Forecast  The drugmaker reaffirmed its full-year forecast of earnings
excluding one-time items of $3.30 to $3.40 a share.  Bristol-Myers, based in New York, paid about $1.39 billion
to Lilly after it acquired Lilly’s former partner Amylin
Pharmaceuticals LLC. Lilly recognized $788 million of that as
income in the quarter.  Sales of Zyprexa fell 68 percent to $374.5 million in the
quarter. That loss was partly offset by revenue from the
antidepressant Cymbalta, which increased 16 percent to $1.24
billion. Several of Lilly’s drugs, including the diabetes
treatment Humalog with $575.8 million in sales and the cancer
therapy Alimta with $643.6 million, were lower than forecast by
 Seamus Fernandez , an analyst with Leerink Swann, in a research
report on Oct. 15.  Lilly had net income of from $1.24 billion, or $1.11, in
last year’s third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
