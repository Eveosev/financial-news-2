Ethanol  production  in the U.S. rose
0.5 percent last week to 801,000 barrels a day.  Stockpiles tumbled 1.2 percent to 18.8 million barrels, the
lowest level in seven weeks while  imports  plunged to an average
of 19,000 barrels a day, down from 122,000 the previous week,
the Energy Department said in a report today.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 93 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, up from 90 percent in the week ended
Oct. 12.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery climbed 0.7 cent,
or 0.3 percent, to $2.413 a gallon at 9:44 a.m. local time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have jumped 9.5 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
