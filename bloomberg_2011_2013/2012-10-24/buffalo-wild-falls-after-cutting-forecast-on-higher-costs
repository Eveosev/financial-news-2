Buffalo Wild Wings Inc. (BWLD) , the casual-
dining chain that gained 54 percent last year, dropped after
yesterday lowering its full-year net income forecast because of
rising food costs.  The  shares  fell 11 percent to $74.70 at the close in  New
York  for the biggest decline since July 25. The Minneapolis-
based company has gained 11 percent this year.  Profit for 2012 will increase 15 percent, Chief Executive
Officer Sally Smith said in a statement. The company had
previously estimated earnings growth of as much as 20 percent.
The chicken-wing seller yesterday forecast net income growth of
20 percent in 2013.  Buffalo Wild Wings, along with other restaurant operators,
has been facing higher costs for raw ingredients such as chicken
wings. The company, which has about 860 stores in the U.S. and
 Canada , can expand to 1,700 North American locations, Smith said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
