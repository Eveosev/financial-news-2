The head of  Iran ’s judiciary insisted
on barring  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  from a Tehran prison visit, in
the latest flare-up of a public dispute that has exposed
mounting tensions between the president and his political
rivals.  “Given the recent letter and the situation that has been
created in no way will we allow a visit of Evin prison to take
place without coordination,” Sadegh Larijani, who heads the
judiciary, was cited as saying today in a state-run  Mehr  news
agency report.  Larijani referred to an Oct. 22 open letter by Ahmadinejad
who said that as the head of the executive branch of government,
he didn’t need “permission or approval” to visit the prison in
northern Tehran where one of his aides has been held for close
to a month.  Ahmadinejad’s bid to visit the prison has brought to the
surface tensions in the ruling elite. His critics have
multiplied attacks, emboldened by his inability to counter the
effects of international sanctions over  Iran’s nuclear program 
that have led to a drop in the currency’s value and to soaring
inflation.  “That the president considers scrutiny on other powers as
his right is an utterly wrong view,” Larijani said. His letter
“has an incorrect reading of the limits of the three powers’
lawful roles.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
