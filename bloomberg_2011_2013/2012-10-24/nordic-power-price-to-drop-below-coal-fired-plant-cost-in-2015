Nordic electricity prices are poised
to drop below the operating cost for coal-fired plants from 2015
through 2025, making the stations uneconomical, Finnish
portfolio manager Energiakolmio Oy said.  “From 2015 through 2025, the Nordic region will see a
growing power glut on the back of new capacity and low
consumption growth, pushing the average baseload electricity
price below the production cost from coal-fired assets,” Toni
Sjoeblom, portfolio manager at the company, said today at a
conference in Tampere,  Finland .  A negative dark spread, the profit margin for burning coal
to generate power, when factoring in fuel and emissions costs,
of 2 euros ($2.59) a megawatt-hour, compared with an average
profit of 3 euros in the past, indicates that the plants will on
average become uneconomical to run, he said.  Traditionally, the front-year Nordic power contract, as
well as derivatives further out on the forward curve, have
tracked the short-run marginal cost for coal plants “almost 100
percent” while hydrological factors have impacted prices from a
shorter-term perspective, he said.  The Nordic region gets half of its average yearly power use
from running water through turbines, a fifth from nuclear
stations, and 20 percent from fossil, mostly coal-fired
stations, which are more expensive to operate.  The 2015 power contract was at 38.45 euros a megawatt-hour
at 10:33 a.m. on the Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in
Oslo, while the 2015 operating cost for coal-fired plants in the
Nordic region was 43.86 euros, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Energiakolmio specializes in power portfolio management and
energy services for business customers. The company manages an
aggregate portfolio of 13 terawatt-hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
