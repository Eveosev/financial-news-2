European Union regulators are asking
the EU courts to fine  Belgium  for breaching rules that require
telecommunications operators and cable companies to broadcast
specific television and radio channels.  The European Commission, the EU regulator in Brussels,
first warned Belgium to amend its rules in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
