Fuel costs at Japan’s nine power
utilities may nearly double this fiscal year from two years
earlier because most of the country’s nuclear reactors remain
shut, a government advisory board estimated.  The nine utilities are expected to pay about 6.8 trillion
yen ($85.2 billion) for fossil fuels, including liquefied
natural gas and crude oil, to run thermal  power plants  in the
year ending March 2013.  That compares with approximately 3.6 trillion yen in the
year ended March 2011, the board said in a  report  on its
website. The surge reflects the switching on of thermal plants
to replace nuclear reactors shut for safety checks following the
quake and tsunami in March 2011 that wrecked the Fukushima Dai-
Ichi atomic plant.  Japan, which imports almost all of its crude oil and
natural gas, had a trade deficit of 558.6 billion yen last
month, marking the first shortfall in September since 1979. The
country may have a trade deficit for the second consecutive year
in the period ending March 2013 as fuel imports soar and all but
two of the nation’s 50 reactors remain offline, the Institute of
Energy Economics said in a July 2 report.  The nine nuclear plant operators had about 5.9 trillion yen
of fuel costs in the year ended March 2012, 2.3 trillion yen
more than a year earlier, the advisory board said in the report.
 Japan ’s utilities reported combined losses of 1.6 trillion yen
last fiscal year due to the jump in fuel costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
