Bulgaria’s Parliament decided to
hold a referendum on whether to continue with the construction
of a nuclear power plant at Belene on the Danube or build a new
reactor at the existing Kozloduy power plant.  Parliament voted 106 to 7 in favor of a referendum, Speaker
Tsetska Tsatcheva said in the assembly in the capital Sofia
today. Prime Minister  Boiko Borissov ’s Cabinet canceled on March
28 a 10 billion-euro ($12.25 billion) project to build a 2,000-
megawatt nuclear power plant at Belene with Rosatom Corp.,
 Russia ’s state nuclear company, after failing to agree on its
cost and find Western investors.  Rosatom increased a 58 million-euro claim against
Bulgaria’s National Electricity Co., filed with the
International Court of Arbitration in Paris in 2011, to 1
billion euros on Sept. 11 to cover construction work and
production costs on the canceled project.  Bulgaria filed a 61 million-euro claim against Rosatom with
an arbitration court in Geneva a year ago, for the purchase of
old equipment.  The referendum may be held at the same time as
parliamentary elections, scheduled for the middle of next year,
to save money, Borissov said on Aug. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
