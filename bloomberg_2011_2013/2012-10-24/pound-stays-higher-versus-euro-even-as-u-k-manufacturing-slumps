The pound stayed higher against the
euro even as an industry report showed Britain’s manufacturing
industry unexpectedly slumped this month.  Britain’s currency strengthened 0.6 percent against the
euro to 80.93 pence at 11:06 a.m. London time and was 0.2
percent higher at $1.5982.  A gauge of factory orders dropped to minus 23 in October
from minus 8 in September, the  Confederation of British Industry 
said in a report in London today. The median of 11 analysts’
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase to
minus 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
