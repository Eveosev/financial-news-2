Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, reported third-quarter profit that missed analysts’
estimates as sales dropped in  South America  and  Asia , and it
incurred costs for shutting a  production line .  Volvo fell the most in 14 months in  Stockholm  trading after
the Gothenburg, Sweden-based manufacturer  said  net income
plunged 64 percent from a year earlier to 1.37 billion kronor
($206.3 million). Earnings were less than the 2.83 billion-krona
average of 12 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
decreased 6.2 percent to 67.1 billion kronor.  “This is a lousy result,” Mattias Eriksson, an equity
strategist at Nordea Bank AB with a buy recommendation on Volvo,
said by phone. “Both trucks and construction equipment
performed worse than expected. The question is, how much of the
problem is with the company and how much is with the market.”  The manufacturer, which completed the sale of its aircraft-
engine business in early October, is overhauling the truck
division to boost operating profit as a proportion of sales by 3
percentage points by 2015. Chief Executive Officer Olof Persson
wants Volvo to rank at the top of the heavy-equipment industry
in terms of operating margins, shifting focus away from pure
sales growth as it competes with larger truckmaker  Daimler AG. (DAI)   Volvo dropped as much as 8.5 percent percent to 82.55
kronor, the biggest intraday slide since Aug. 18, 2011, and was
trading down 6.4 percent at 9:21 a.m. That pared the stock’s
 gain  this year to 12 percent, valuing the commercial-vehicle and
construction-equipment manufacturer at 179.5 billion kronor.  Forecast Reiterated  The company, whose truck brands include Volvo and Renault
in  Europe , Mack in the U.S. and UD in  Japan , reiterated a
forecast from July that European industrywide sales in 2012 will
fall to 230,000 vehicles, while the North American market will
increase to 250,000 trucks. That would amount to a 5.1 percent
drop for Europe, based on the 242,400-vehicle market that Volvo
estimated for the region in 2011, and a 16 percent increase in
 North America  from last year’s 216,000 deliveries.  “We have a tough quarter ahead of us to manage the
consequences of the slow demand in the third quarter,” CEO
Persson said in today’s statement. “However, with the
production adjustments we are currently implementing, we believe
we will have the right level of capacity going into 2013.”  The company is “ready to adjust production further”
should vehicle markets continue to slow, Persson said today at a
press conference in Stockholm.  Profitability Falls  Third-quarter revenue at the truckmaking division fell 6.5
percent and operating profit plunged 57 percent. The unit’s
operating margin narrowed to 3.8 percent of sales from 8.4
percent a year earlier. Revenue at the construction-equipment
business dropped 8.9 percent, while earnings fell 55 percent.
The margin fell to 4.9 percent from 9.9 percent.  One-time charges in the quarter included 560 million kronor
for reorganizing UD Trucks, including halting the division’s
production for the U.S. market, and a 500 million-krona
provision for warranties, Volvo said. Currency movements helped
earnings by 594 million kronor.  Volvo’s truck orders declined 25 percent from a year
earlier to 45,272 vehicles, Volvo said. Deliveries fell 7.8
percent to 50,511 trucks, with the biggest contractions in South
America and Asia.  Swedish competitor  Scania AB (SCVB)  reported third-quarter net
income of 1.5 billion kronor on Oct. 22, and said its order
decline slowed to 10 percent from a 14 percent drop the previous
three months. Daimler plans to publish figures tomorrow, and
Munich-based  MAN SE (MAN)  is scheduled to report results Oct. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
