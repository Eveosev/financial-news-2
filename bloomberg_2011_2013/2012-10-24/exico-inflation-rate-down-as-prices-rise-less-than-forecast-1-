Mexico’s  consumer prices  rose less
than economists expected in early October, and annual inflation
slowed after accelerating in each of the past five months.  Prices climbed 0.45 percent in the first two weeks of
October, the national statistics agency said on its  website  today,
compared with the 0.48 percent median estimate of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Annual inflation  slowed to 4.64 percent
from a 30-month high of 4.77 percent at the end of September.  Annual inflation has remained above the central bank’s 2
percent to 4 percent target range since June as a bird flu
outbreak in Mexico and a drought in the U.S. drove up egg, poultry
and grain prices. Economists expect inflation of 4.1 percent by
year-end, according to a Citigroup Inc. survey published Oct. 22.
As recently as Aug. 15, policy makers said they expected inflation
to slow below 4 percent this year.  “We’re seeing shocks that we expect will be temporary,”
central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said Oct. 19. “It would be
difficult to resolve this through monetary policy alone.”  The central bank board, led by Carstens, kept the key rate at
4.5 percent on Sept. 7, the lowest level among major rate-setting
banks in Latin America after  Peru .  Borrowing Costs  The only Group of 20 nation to leave borrowing costs
unchanged and not step up asset purchases in the past three years
will keep rates on hold until March 2014, according to the survey
by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit this month.  Economists also bumped up their 2013 inflation forecast to
3.7 percent from 3.66 percent and raised their 2013 growth
estimate to 3.5 percent from 3.3 percent.  With analysts forecasting inflation above 4 percent through
2012, “the worsened scenario is worrisome,” central bank Deputy
Governor Manuel Sanchez wrote in a Sept. 28 report.  The peso has advanced 7.6 percent this year against the
dollar, the most among the greenback’s 16 most-traded
counterparts. The peso rose 0.2 percent to 12.9515 per U.S. dollar
