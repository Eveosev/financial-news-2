Crude oil options volatility
declined on speculation prices may stabilize after underlying
futures slid for a fifth straight day to a three-month low.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
December, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.1 percent on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 4:15 p.m., down from 32.6 percent
yesterday.  “It’s odd that it should go down when crude is down almost
a dollar and took out yesterday’s lows so the downtrend is still
intact,” said Jim Colburn, a vice president and energy options
broker at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “The fear that was
in this market yesterday is gone. Even though the price is
telling you down, the options market is saying calm or, maybe,
we don’t go down.”  December-delivery crude oil fell 94 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $85.73 a barrel, the lowest settlement since July 10. Prices
have declined 6.9 percent in five days of losses.  Most-Active  The most active options in electronic trading today were
