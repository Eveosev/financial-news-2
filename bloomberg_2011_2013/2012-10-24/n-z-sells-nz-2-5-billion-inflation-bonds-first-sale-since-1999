New Zealand sold NZ$2.5 billion
($2.03 billion) of inflation-linked notes, its first sale of
such debt since 1999 and the nation’s biggest-ever single
offering.  Investors bid for more than NZ$4 billion of the 2 percent
bonds maturing Sept. 20, 2025, the New Zealand Debt Management
Office said today in a  statement . The sale was the first New
Zealand has carried out using syndication, Brendon Doyle,
treasurer of the Wellington-based NZDMO, said by phone.  “The sale was a resounding success,” said Fergus McDonald, the Auckland-based head of bonds and currencies at
Tyndall Investment Management New Zealand Ltd., which oversees
about NZ$3.4 billion in assets. “It’s a benefit for New Zealand
because it lengthens the debt profile of the country. For
investors, it’s offered quite a healthy real rate of return.”  New Zealand’s  10-year yield  fell four basis points to 3.56
percent today in Wellington. The nation’s notes have handed
investors a 4.5 percent return this year, while its existing
2016 debt indexed to consumer-price gains climbed 0.4 percent,
according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The yield on the 4.5 percent inflation-linked security due
February 2016 lost two basis points to 1.35 percent. It closed
at 1.37 percent yesterday, the highest since August 2011.  “We expect that the inflation-indexed bond market will
continue to grow and that it will become a core part of the New
Zealand government’s funding programs,” Doyle said in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
