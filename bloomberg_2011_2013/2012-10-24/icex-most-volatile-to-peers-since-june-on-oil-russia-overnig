Russian stocks are posting the most
swings in four months relative to their emerging-market peers as
sliding oil and metals prices damp the outlook for the world’s
biggest energy exporter.  The Micex Index’s 30-day  historical volatility , a measure
of fluctuations in Moscow’s equities gauge, climbed to 20.27
yesterday, 6.66 points above that for the  MSCI Emerging-Markets
Index (MXEF)  and the biggest gap since June 22, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the
most-traded Russian stocks in New York slid the most since July,
while the  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest Russian
exchange-traded fund, sank to a six-week low.  Crude producers OAO Lukoil and OAO Gazprom Neft  drove
declines  among Russian U.S.-listed stocks yesterday, as oil
tumbled to a three-month low on concern the slowing global
economy will cut demand. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index
of 24 raw materials erased its 2012 advance. Oil and natural gas
contributed about 50 percent of Russian government revenue last
year and resource companies make up eight of the 10  biggest
equities  on the  Micex. (INDEXCF)   “The Micex is a very volatile benchmark as it’s commodity
driven,” Arjun Jayaraman, who manages $400 million in emerging-
market equities at Causeway Capital Management LLC in Los
Angeles, said in a phone interview yesterday. “Investors are
getting fearful. We have seen a downturn in oil and commodity
prices in the last two days and typically when things turn down,
volatility goes up.”  Higher volatility means an asset or index can swing
dramatically in a short period, increasing the potential for
unexpected losses.  Most BRIC Swings  The Micex tumbled 1.3 percent to 1,455.31 in Moscow
yesterday, the biggest one-day drop since Sept. 26.  The gauge, which added 0.2 percent to 1457.71 by 3:52 p.m.
in the Russian capital, has the highest volatility reading of
the biggest  emerging markets  known as the BRICs, and was the
most volatile versus  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index yesterday since
June. The Bovespa lost 1.7 percent to 57,690.24 yesterday, the
weakest close since Sept. 5.  Crude for December delivery sank 2.3 percent to $86.67 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the lowest
settlement price since July 12, as companies from U.S. chemical
maker DuPont Co. to South Korea’s Posco, the third-biggest Asian
steelmaker by output, reported earnings that missed analysts’
estimates. Oil in New York has retreated 21 percent from a 2012
high of $109.77 reached on Feb. 24, as the  European debt crisis 
stokes concern over the slowdown in the global economy.  Crude traded 0.3 percent lower at $86.44 a barrel by 7:43
a.m. in New York.  Lukoil Sinks  American depositary receipts of  Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s biggest
independent oil producer, slid 3 percent to $61.95 in New York
yesterday, the steepest decline since June 21. The ADRs, equal
to one ordinary share, traded at their  biggest premium  to the
Moscow stock since Oct. 15.  Lukoil’s  stock  on the Micex, where it has the second-
biggest weighting behind gas company OAO Gazprom, fell for a
second day today, extending yesterday’s 2.3 percent slide to
slump 0.5 percent to 1,929.60 rubles, the equivalent of $61.49.  Brent oil for December settlement rebounded today, after
declining 1.1 percent yesterday on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend and
biggest export earner, also gained, rising for the first time in
seven days to add 1 percent to $108.06 a barrel. It fell to the
lowest level since Oct. 3 yesterday.  Gazprom Neft  ADRs of Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of the world’s biggest
natural gas producer, declined 3 percent in New York yesterday
to $24.52, a three-week low, after its shares lost 1.3 percent
on the Micex. The Moscow stock advanced 0.9 percent to 155.70
rubles today, or $4.96. Each ADR is equal to five Moscow-traded
shares.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  retreated 1.4 percent
yesterday to 1,413.11. The S&P GSCI Spot commodities index fell
1.4 percent, as copper, gold, nickel and palladium declined.
Russia is the world’s biggest producer of nickel and palladium.
The spot index was 0.2 percent higher today.  While Russian U.S.-traded stocks and ADRs slipped,  futures 
expiring in December on the dollar-denominated RTS Index rose
0.5 percent to 145,730 in New York. The RTS Volatility Index,
which measures expected swings in the index futures, also fell,
dropping 2.1 percent to 26.84.  Traders may be anticipating a “snap-back or rally” in
Russian stocks after the declines, Causeway’s Jayaraman said.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
rose 3 percent to HK$4.53 in Hong Kong trading, or 58 U.S.
cents. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.4 percent today,
slipping for the fourth trading day.  Futures due in December on the ruble rose for the first
time in five days, strengthening 0.3 percent to 31.68 per dollar
yesterday in New York.  Russia ’s currency rebounded from
yesterday’s 1.2 percent slump in Moscow, adding 0.2 percent to
31.39 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
