Barclays Bank Kenya Ltd. (BCBL) , the
country’s second-biggest lender by market value, closed at its
highest level in more than 14 months on bets profit in the nine
months through September will grow as much as 30 percent.  The shares advanced 4.4 percent to 15.50 shillings by the
3:00 p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital.  The stock has risen for  seven straight sessions , the
longest streak in a year, and closed at the highest level since
July 25, 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About
720,000 shares traded, more than double the three-month moving
average volume.  “They have been looking to grow their loan book,” Davis
Mika, an analyst at Nairobi-based Contrarian Investing  Kenya 
Ltd., said by phone today. “Investors are taking positions
ahead of the announcement of third-quarter earnings that I
estimate will grow between 20 and 30 percent.”  Lenders in the east African nation are expected to begin
announcing earnings any time starting next week, he said.  In the six months through June, Barclays Kenya’s profit
rose 17 percent as it boosted earnings from loans amid record
interest rates. Net income increased to 4.27 billion shilling
($50 million) in the six months through June from 3.64 billion
shillings a year earlier. Net interest income, the money banks
earn from charges on loans, grew 21 percent to 8.97 billion
shillings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
