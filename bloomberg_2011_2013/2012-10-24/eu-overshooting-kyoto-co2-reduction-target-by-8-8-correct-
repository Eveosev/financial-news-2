(Corrects percentage reduction starting in headline.)  European Union governments are
likely to reduce emissions outside the blocâ€™s carbon market by
8.8 percent more than required under the  Kyoto Protocol ,
according to projections published today on an  EU website .  The oversupply of reductions needed for compliance with the
1997 protocol will amount to 1.03 billion metric tons in the
five years through 2012, potentially freeing up some of the 419
million tons of offset emission credits the nations are buying
for compliance, according to the data.  Italy is the only nation likely to undershoot its reduction
target, with a yearly shortfall of 11.7 million tons, the EU
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
