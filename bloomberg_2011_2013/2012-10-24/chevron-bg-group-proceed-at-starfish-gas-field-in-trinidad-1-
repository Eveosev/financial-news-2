Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  BG Group Plc (BG/)  have
approved the Starfish natural gas field development project in
Trinidad and Tobago, Chevron said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The field off the east coast of Trinidad is operated by BG
Group subsidiaries, Chevron said. Both companies have a 50
percent stake in the project, according to the statement.  “First gas from the Starfish field is planned to come on
stream in the fourth quarter of 2014,” Chevron said in the
statement.  Natural gas produced at the field will be mixed with output
from the Dolphin project and delivered through existing
pipelines to supply contractual commitments with the National
Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago and Atlantic LNG, said
Chevron. The company, with BG Group, has produced natural gas
from the Dolphin field since 1996, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
