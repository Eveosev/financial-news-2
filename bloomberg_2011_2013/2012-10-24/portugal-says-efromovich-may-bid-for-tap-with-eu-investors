 Brazilian investor German
Efromovich, owner of the Synergy Group that controls the Avianca
airline brands, may bid for Portuguese airline TAP SGPS SA with
European investors, the  Portuguese government  said.  The move would allow Efromovich to comply with European
Union rules that cap outside ownership of the bloc’s airlines at
49 percent, Maria Luis  Albuquerque ,  Portugal ’s secretary of
state for treasury and finance, said in parliament today.  The candidate has made clear it plans to comply with EU
rules and has announced its “intention” of making a bid for
TAP in partnership with EU nationals, she said.  Synergy was the only company that was picked to make a
binding offer for TAP, the Portuguese government said in a
statement on Oct. 18. The deadline for Synergy to submit its
final bid ends on Dec. 7, the  Finance Ministry  said in a
statement published yesterday in the country’s official gazette.  To contact the reporter on this story:
