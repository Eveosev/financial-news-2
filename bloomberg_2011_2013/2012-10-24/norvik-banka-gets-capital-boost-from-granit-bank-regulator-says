Norvik Banka AS, Latvia’s seventh-
biggest lender by deposits, is solvent and got a capital boost
from a new investor, the country’s banking regulator said.  Sandor Demjan, a real-estate developer who is also the
majority owner of Granit Bank Zrt. in  Hungary , invested more
than 5 million euros ($6.5 million) in Norvik’s capital and is
ready to commit more funds, the regulator said in a  statement 
late yesterday.  The regulator’s statement comes after Pietiek.com website
reported yesterday that Norvik was told by the watchdog to raise
additional capital within a month’s time. The regulator
restricted Norvik’s lending in June and placed the bank under
supervision, according to Pietiek.com.  Norvik said it increased capital by 11.6 million euros,
citing an investment from a company owned by Demjan, according
to the bank’s  statement  from late yesterday. The lender didn’t
specify how much Demjan invested or whether capital also came
from other sources.  -- Editors: Andrea Dudik, Pawel Kozlowski  To contact the reporter on this story:
