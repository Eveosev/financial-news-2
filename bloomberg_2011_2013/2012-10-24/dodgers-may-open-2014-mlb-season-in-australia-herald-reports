Major League Baseball  said it isn’t
in negotiations with the  Los Angeles Dodgers  or any team to open
the 2014 season with a series in Australia.  The Sydney Morning Herald reported today that negotiations
were well advanced to bring the Dodgers, owned by a group
including National Basketball Association Hall of Famer  Magic Johnson , for a possible three-game series against the  Arizona 
Diamondbacks at the Sydney Cricket Ground.  “We are not currently exploring the possibility with the
Dodgers or any other team to play in Australia,” MLB spokesman
Pat Courtney said in an interview in the press box at the World
Series opener in San Francisco.  The Herald reported that the event would attract 25,000
overseas visitors and generate $A80 million ($82.8 million) for
the New South Wales state economy.  Elizabeth Cage, a Sydney-based spokeswomen for MLB
Australia, said baseball officials and local promoters had been
working on the possibility of staging a series in Australia for
five to six years.  “The teams that were mentioned are just two of quite a few
teams that have been included in the conversation around this
idea,” Cage said in a telephone interview. “We’re optimistic
and we keep moving the needle forward, but we’re a long way from
actually signing paperwork and making an announcement and having
it be a real deal.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
