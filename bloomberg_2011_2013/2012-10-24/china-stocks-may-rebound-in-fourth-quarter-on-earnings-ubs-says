Chinaâ€™s stocks may rebound in the
fourth quarter as the slowdown in earnings growth halts and
liquidity supports valuations, according to Chen Li, head of
China equity research at UBS AG.  Fourth-quarter earnings for non-financial companies may
grow 9.9 percent, compared with an 11 percent drop in the third
quarter, Chen said in a note before the start of a briefing in
 Shanghai .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
