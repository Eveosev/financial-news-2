Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world’s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, reported a 41 percent
increase in third-quarter profit as more Mexicans signed up for
cable and satellite television.  Net income climbed to 2.86 billion pesos ($220 million)
from 2.02 billion a year earlier, Mexico City-based Televisa
said yesterday in a statement. Sales rose 8.7 percent to 17.4
billion pesos, compared with the 17 billion-peso average of six
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Televisa is counting on the expansion of its pay-TV
businesses as broadcast-advertising sales growth slows with
viewers turning to other media such as the Internet. The Sky
satellite business lured 332,693 subscribers for a total of 4.88
million, and Televisa’s three cable-TV units added about 30,000
video customers for a total of 2.26 million.  “All the divisions maintained healthy performances,
especially demonstrated in the pay-TV segments,” said Julio Zetina, an analyst at Vector Casa de Bolsa SA in Mexico City, in
a research note yesterday. “The report was a positive
surprise.”  Broadcast advertising sales rose 1 percent to 6.12 billion
pesos, missing the 6.36 billion-peso estimate of Vera Rossi, an
analyst at Barclays Plc in  New York .  The company’s loss from stakes in jointly held businesses
jumped 71 percent to 209 million pesos, mostly because of its
50 percent ownership of mobile-phone carrier Grupo Iusacell SA,
Televisa said. The divestiture earlier this year of a stake in
Gestora de Inversiones Audiovisuales La Sexta SA helped
mitigate the third-quarter loss, the company said.  Televisa was little changed at 60.61 pesos yesterday in
Mexico City before results were announced. The shares have risen
3.2 percent this year.  (Televisa is scheduled to hold a conference call at 8 a.m.
New York time to discuss the results. To listen, dial
