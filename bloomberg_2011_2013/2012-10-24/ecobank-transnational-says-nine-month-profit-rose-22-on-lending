Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , a bank
that operates in 32 African countries, said nine-month profit
rose 22 percent as income from lending jumped.  Net income climbed to $151.3 million in the first nine
months of the year from $123.6 million in the year-earlier
period, the Lome-based lender said in a statement e-mailed by
the Ghana Stock Exchange today. Net interest income advanced 56
percent to $622.4 million as lending to customers increased by
50 percent, the lender said.  Ecobank acquired  Trust Bank Ltd. (TRBK) , a closely held Ghanaian
lender, in January and merged it with its local unit to create
the biggest lender by assets in the West African country. It
also acquired Oceanic Bank International Plc, a Nigerian lender
that had been bailed out by the central bank, in February.  “The acquisition of Oceanic Bank and TTB are contributing
positively to our performance,” Ecobank said in the statement.  The stock rose 9.1 percent to 12 pesewas by the 3 p.m.
close in Accra, lost 2 percent to 12.1 naira in Lagos and traded
at 35  CFA francs  in Abidjan.  Operating expenses increased to $900.1 million at the end
of September from $546.2 million in the year-earlier period. The
bank needs to reduce costs, said Anastacia Arko, an analyst at
Databank Financial Services Ltd. in Accra.  “Though almost all revenue streams advanced, staff costs
and other operating expenses increased appreciably,” she said
by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
