The Chilean peso strengthened on
signs that  China ’s manufacturing is shrinking at a slower pace,
easing concern about the outlook for global economic growth.  The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 481.63 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close of trading in Santiago, ending a four-day losing
streak. It fell 1.2 percent yesterday, the most since June.  “The peso is slightly up because markets outside are
slightly up,” Ronald Volpi, head of spot currency trading at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA, said in a phone interview.  U.S. stocks advanced after data showed purchases of new
homes rose in September to a two-year high. The preliminary
reading for a private purchasing managers’ index in China was
49.1, compared with a final reading of 47.9 last month. Figures
above 50 indicate expansion.  The peso, which has rallied 7.9 percent against the dollar
this year, is forecast to trade at 480 in three months,
according to economist and trader surveys published today by the
central bank.  The  monetary-policy rate  will be held steady at 5 percent
for at least two years, while inflation will reach 2.9 percent
in a year and 3 percent in two years, according to the surveys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
