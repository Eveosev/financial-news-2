Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s biggest
bank, may have a  capital  shortfall for its domestic business of
as much as 18 billion euros ($23.3 billion) based on what it has
“actually available” to absorb losses, Barclays Plc said.  Santander dismissed the analysis.  The Madrid-based bank includes capital invested in
 subsidiaries  when calculating its core Tier 1 capital at the
parent as well as recognizing it at unit level, Rohith Chandra-
Rajan, an  analyst  at Barclays in  London , said in a report dated
yesterday.  While the Bank of Spain allows this approach, the rules may
change should the  European Central Bank  assume powers for
industry regulation across the  euro zone  as part of steps toward
creating a banking union, said Chandra-Rajan.  Core Tier 1 capital adequacy for Santander’s Spanish
business is “more like” 2 percent based on the capital
available to absorb domestic losses, compared with the 10
percent reported by the bank, he said.  The Barclays analysis is wrong because deducting
subsidiaries’ capital from the parent’s doesn’t work due to
differing local definitions and reporting criteria from country
to country, an official at Santander’s press office said by e-
mail.  “Besides using incorrect figures, this exercise assigns a
value of zero to the units outside of  Spain , which are owned by
the Spanish parent and worth considerably more than zero,” the
official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
