European Union governments will
probably reduce emissions outside the bloc’s carbon market by
8.8 percent more than required under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol,
according to projections published today on an  EU website .  The oversupply of reductions among the 15 older members of
the bloc will amount to 1.03 billion metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent in the five years through 2012 compared with
a limit of 11.8 billion tons, according to the data. That
includes 419 million tons of United Nations offset emission
credits those nations are buying for compliance in the period,
the data show.  Kyoto Protocol rules state that countries can use emission
credits from the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint
Implementation programs to help them meet targets. The EU began
its carbon market in 2005, covering about half the economy, to
help it meet its Kyoto goals and protect the climate. Nations
with surpluses can sell credits to countries with shortages or
to factories and power stations in the market.  Of the 15 older EU members, 10 are using offsets, according
to the data. Of those,  Italy  is the only nation that will
undershoot its reduction target, with a shortfall of 58.5
million tons in the five years, the data show. That’s after the
nation buys about 10 million tons of offsets.  Luxembourg’s purchases of 14.5 million tons of credits will
allow it to meet its target almost precisely, according to the
projections.  Eight nations have bought 69.5 million tons more offsets
than they will probably need in the five years, the data show.
Spain, which is buying the most offsets at 194 million tons in
the period, will overshoot its target by 7 million tons.  Netherlands Surplus  The nation with the biggest surplus of credits in the
period will probably be the Netherlands, with 14.5 million tons,
followed by  Belgium  with 14 million tons, according to the data.  Ireland,  Portugal  and  Finland  probably won’t need any of
the 20.5 million tons of credits they are purchasing, the
projections show.  December Certified Emission Reduction credits from the so-
called CDM dropped as much as 22 percent today to 76 euro cents
($0.98) a ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London  and
were at 78 cents at 1:21 p.m. Emission Reduction Units for the
same month from the JI plunged 15 percent to 63 cents a ton,
having slumped 91 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
