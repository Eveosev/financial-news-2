Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , is projected to open between 0.14 percent and
0.18 percent, within the Federal Reserve’s target of zero to
0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.28 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.10 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.15 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  There aren’t any open-market operations scheduled today by
the central bank. The Fed is replacing short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to keep
borrowing costs low.  Policy makers will conclude a two-day meeting in  Washington 
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
