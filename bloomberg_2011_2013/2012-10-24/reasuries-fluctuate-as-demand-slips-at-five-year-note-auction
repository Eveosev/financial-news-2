Treasuries fluctuated after the U.S.
sale of $35 billion in five-year notes as Federal Reserve policy
makers are forecast to retain plans to buy $40 billion in
mortgage-backed securities each month for an indefinite period.  U.S. 10-year note yields rose earlier as a government
report showed U.S.  new home sales  increased to a two-year high
in September, damping demand for the safest securities. The
five-year note auction saw the most demand since November 2010
from non-primary dealer investors including pension funds and
insurance companies, while overall bidding was lower than
average. The  Federal Open Market Committee  releases a policy
statement at 2:15 p.m.  New York  time.  “The market is waiting for the FOMC news to possibly give
us direction,” said Justin Lederer, an  interest-rate  strategist
at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, one of 21 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed. “The auction was OK, but the market is
looking forward to the uncertainty of the election, the fiscal
cliff and the other uncertainties.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note  rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.77 percent at 1:32 p.m.
New York Time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. The
1.625 percent note due in August 2022 fell 1/8, or $1.25 per
$1,000 face amount, to 98 21/32. The yield climbed to 1.83
percent Oct. 18, the highest level since Sept. 18.  The  yield  on the current five-year note was little changed
at 0.75 percent.  Auction Results  The five-year notes sold today drew a yield of 0.774
percent, compared with a forecast of 0.775 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s primary
dealers.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.73,
compared with an average of 2.92 for the previous 10 sales.  Direct bidders purchased 15.5 percent of the notes,
compared with an average of 10.2 percent at the last 10
auctions. Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 42.3 percent of the notes,
compared with an average of 42.7 percent for the past 10 sales.  “The auction was very vanilla,” said Thomas Simons, a
government debt economist in New York at Jefferies Group Inc.,
one of 21 primary dealers that trades with the Fed. “The auction
did better than five-year note auctions have done of late and
there was strong real investor demand, but we did tail a bit.
Anytime you have real money demand like we saw today, then it’s
generally an OK sale.”  Debt Returns  Five-year notes have returned 1.7 percent this year,
matching the 1.7 percent gain by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year
securities rose 9.2 percent in 2011, while Treasuries overall
advanced 9.8 percent.  Today’s offering is the second of three this week totaling
$99 billion. The government will sell $29 billion in seven-year
securities tomorrow. Yesterday’s auction of $35 billion in two-
year notes yielded 0.295 percent.  The 10-year yield will increase to 2.06 percent by June 30,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists with the most
recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  New home sales climbed 5.7 percent to a 389,000 annual
pace, the most since April 2010, following a revised 368,000
rate in August, figures from the Commerce Department showed
today in  Washington . The median estimate of 75 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for sales to rise to 385,000.  Economic Data  “The stronger U.S. data that we have seen means there’s no
need to add extra stimulus,” said Craig Collins, managing
director of rates trading at Bank of Montreal in  London . “The
Fed is happy to wait and see that hopefully the trend of better
data continues. The Treasury market won’t have a problem
digesting the five-year supply today.”  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co. in  Newport Beach ,  California ,
said in a twitter message that the Fed may announce a target for
economic growth at the end of its policy meeting today, and such
a move “would be reflationary.”  The Fed may switch from its “extended period” language
and adopt a target for gross domestic product “or something
close” today or at its meeting in December, Gross wrote. The
Fed statement is scheduled for 2:15 p.m. New York time.  The central bank at its previous meeting on Sept. 12-13
pledged to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero at least
through the middle of 2015.  Charles Evans , president of the Fed
Bank of  Chicago , has said policy makers should promise to keep
rates low until the  unemployment rate  falls to 7 percent, as
long as inflation does not breach 3 percent.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt, was
2.49 percentage points. The average over the past decade is 2.17
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
