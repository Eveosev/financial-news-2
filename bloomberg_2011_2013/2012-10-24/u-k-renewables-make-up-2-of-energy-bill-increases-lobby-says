U.K. programs promoting the use of
renewable power accounted for just 2 percent of the increase in
consumer bills over two years, an industry lobby said, after
 Centrica Plc (CNA) ’s British Gas and RWE Npower Plc raised charges.  Renewables contributed 4 pounds ($6.40) to the average jump
in a dual-fuel energy bill of about 205 pounds in the two years
to July, the Renewable Energy Association said today, citing
data from energy regulator Ofgem and the government. Gains in
wholesale gas prices were among the main reasons for driving up
energy costs, the industry group said in an e-mailed statement.  “The role of renewables in increasing energy bills is
often greatly exaggerated,” Chief Executive Officer Gaynor
Hartnell said. “The figures show it’s our reliance on fossil
fuels that is costing us dear.”  Npower will increase power rates an average 9.1 percent and
gas 8.8 percent on Nov. 26 and  British Gas , the biggest natural-
gas and power supplier to U.K. homes, will raise prices for both
an average 6 percent from Nov. 16. Both blamed higher wholesale
gas costs and clean energy policies. Those gains mean renewables
add an even smaller proportion to bills, equivalent to 22 pounds
of the average household payment this year, the lobby said.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  said Oct. 18 the U.K. would
propose a measure to ensure consumers get the lowest rates,
softening a remark a day earlier in which he said companies
would be forced to give the lowest prices to customers.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
