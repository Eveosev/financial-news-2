American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
U.S. maker of wind-turbine components, said China’s Supreme
People’s Court will hear a copyright infringement case Oct. 26
against Sinovel Wind Group Co.   AMSC is seeking $6 million in compensation from the Chinese
turbine maker, the Devens, Massachusetts-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today.   This is one of four cases AMSC is pursuing against Sinovel,
seeking a total of more than $1.2 billion in damages for
allegedly violating sales contracts and stealing its technology.
Sinovel stopped accepting contracted shipments from AMSC in
March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
