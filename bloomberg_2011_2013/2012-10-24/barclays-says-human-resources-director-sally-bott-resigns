Barclays in Feb. 2011. She was previously global human resources
director at BP Plc and a director at UBS AG, where she chaired
the Swiss lender’s compensation committee.  Her departure comes as Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins  overhauls the management team after he succeeded Robert
Diamond as CEO in August.  Bott’s departure was reported earlier by Sky News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
