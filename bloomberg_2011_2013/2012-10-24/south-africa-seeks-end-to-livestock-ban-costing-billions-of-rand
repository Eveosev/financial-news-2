South Africa sought to end a global
ban on exports of its livestock that is costing the continent’s
biggest economy billions of rand a year by asking international
inspectors to declare its herds free of foot and mouth disease.  The country asked the  World Organization for Animal Health 
to certify it free of the disease, Steve Galane, a spokesman for
the agriculture department, said today by phone from  Pretoria .  “Inspectors from the organization visited South Africa for
18 days from Oct. 1 to check the quality of state veterinarian
services,” said Hendrik Botha, chairman of the KwaZulu-Natal
 Red Meat Producers’ Organisation , from his farm near Matatiele.  Exports of cloven-hoofed animals such as sheep and cows
were halted in February last year when cattle near the country’s
Mozambican border tested positive for the disease. Shipments of
wool, initially banned, were subsequently allowed as there isn’t
any production of the material in the outbreak area, Botha said.  The ban costs the South African economy about 4 billion
rand ($450 million) a year, said Andre Jooste, a researcher at
the state-sponsored  National Agricultural Marketing Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
