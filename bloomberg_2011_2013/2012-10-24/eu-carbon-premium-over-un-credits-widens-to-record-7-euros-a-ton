The premium for European Union
carbon permits for December over United Nations Certified
Emission Reduction offsets expanded to a record as supplies of
CERs are set to grow in November by the most in 10 months.  The differential, traded as a separate contact on  London â€™s
ICE Futures Europe exchange, widened 1.3 percent to 7 euros a
metric ton at 10:17 a.m., the biggest since the contract began
trading in 2008.  The UN is scheduled to create more than 35 million new CERs
in November, a jump of 29 percent from October and the most
since January, according to data from the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
