The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index climbed 3 basis points to 210
basis points as of 10:11 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The index, which has ranged from 168.5 to 229.5 since
June, is set for its highest close since Oct. 17, according to
data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 2 basis points to 122 as of 8:52
a.m. in Hong Kong, Credit Agricole SA prices show. The gauge,
which has ranged from 112.6 basis points to 175.3 basis in the
second half so far, is set for its fourth daily increase,
according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
142 as of 11:52 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit Agricole.
The index is on course for its highest close since Oct. 16,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
