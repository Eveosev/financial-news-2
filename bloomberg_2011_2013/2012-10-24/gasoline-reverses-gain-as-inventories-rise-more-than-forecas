Gasoline futures fell, reversing an
earlier gain, after the Energy Department reported inventories
climbed more than forecast last week.  The government said inventories grew 1.44 million barrels
to 198.6 million in the week ended Oct. 19. The median estimate
of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 500,000-barrel
increase.  Gasoline for November delivery fell 0.35 cent to $2.6015 a
gallon at 10:39 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices
were $2.6144 before the reportâ€™s release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  Distillate supplies fell 646,000 barrels to 118 million in
the seven days ended Oct. 19, according to department data.
Analysts estimated a 1.2 million-barrel decrease, according to
the survey.  November-delivery heating oil fell 0.79 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.0355 a gallon, from $3.0524 before the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
