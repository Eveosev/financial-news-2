Brazilian farmers have sold an
estimated 47 percent of their expected 2012-13 soybean crop,
compared with 31 percent a year ago, according to industry
researcher Soybean & Corn Advisor Inc.  Farmers mostly stopped contracting more of the expected
crop after a recent drop in prices, Hinsdale, Illinois-based
Soybean & Corn Advisor wrote in an online  report  today.  Brazil is expected to overtake the U.S. as the largest
soybean shipper in 2012-13, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
forecasts. Soybean futures in  Chicago  have dropped 13 percent
from their peak of $17.89 a bushel on Sept. 4.  “Brazilian farmers have been very aggressive in forward
contracting their 2012-13 soybean crop,” the consulting company
led by Michael Cordonnier wrote.  In Sorriso, a municipality in the state of Mato Grosso that
is the biggest soybean-producing area in Brazil, farmers have
sold an estimated 60 percent of their crop, according to Soybean
& Corn Advisor.  “That is not expected to go any higher until farmers are
more certain of their production,” the researcher wrote. “If
farmers contract more than 60 percent of their anticipated
production, they run the risk of not having enough soybeans to
fulfill the contract if they run into adverse weather during the
growing season.”  Most forward sales in Sorriso were done in July and August
at a price of 42 to 43 reais ($20.72-$21.21) for a bag of 60
kilograms (132 pounds), according to Soybean & Corn Advisor.
Prices rose to 54 reais per bag by the end of August, the
company wrote.  In Campo Novo do Parecis in western Mato Grosso, farmers
contracted half of their expected crop by the end of August at
prices from 48 to 60 reais per bag, and prices in recent days
dropped to a level of 40 to 42 reais, the researcher said.  Brazil ’s farmers have sold almost all of last year’s crop,
with an estimated 3 percent of the harvest still available in
Mato Grosso and 8 percent in Parana, Soybean & Corn Advisor
said. The soybean export season has ended in Brazil, and new
shipments will probably not start until February, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
