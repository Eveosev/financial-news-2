The naira weakened the most in a
week as oil importers boosted demand for dollars and the price
of crude, the country’s key export, retreated.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer fell less
than 0.1 percent to 157.30 per dollar as of 12:15 p.m. in Lagos,
the commercial capital, the biggest decline since Oct. 17,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The naira has
strengthened 3.2 percent this year, the best performer in
Africa.  Nigeria relies on imports to meet 70 percent of its fuel
needs because of inadequate refining capacity, according to the
Petroleum Ministry. Oil pared gains in New York after a drop in
manufacturing data from  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy,
signaled the region’s debt woes may be far from over.  The strengthening of the naira “has been limited because
of high dollar demand,” Kunle Ezun and Kenneth Asenime,
analysts at  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)  in Lagos, wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients today.  Yields on Nigeria’s 16.39 percent debt maturing January
2022 rose five basis points to 13.38 percent, according to
yesterday’s data on the  Financial Markets Dealers Association 
website. Rates on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 fell by four basis points to 4.56 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi strengthened for a fourth day, appreciating
0.1 percent to 1.875 a dollar in Accra, the capital, its
strongest since May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
