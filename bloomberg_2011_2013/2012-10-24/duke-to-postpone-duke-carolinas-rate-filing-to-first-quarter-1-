Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  is postponing
seeking a rate increase for its Duke Energy Carolinas utility in
 North Carolina , its largest market, until the first quarter next
year.  Duke, based in  Charlotte , North Carolina, had planned to
file the request with the state’s utilities commission by the
end of the year. Earlier this month, Duke’s Progress Energy
Carolinas utility filed a request for its first general rate
increase since 1987, asking regulators to boost revenues by
about $387 million a year.  The “sheer workload” involved in handling two rate cases
at once, for both the company and regulators, made the delay
“prudent,”  Mike Hughes , a Duke spokesman, said in a telephone
interview today.  Duke told the North Carolina Utilities Commission Public
Staff that it intends to file the second rate case around the
first of February, Robert Gruber, executive director of the
agency that represents the state’s consumers, said in a
telephone interview.  The North Carolina Utilities Commission and the state’s
attorney general also are investigating a boardroom coup at Duke
that led the largest utility-owner in the U.S. to switch chief
executive officers hours after buying North Carolina-based
Progress Energy Inc. in July.  Duke Energy Carolinas sells power to 1.9 million homes and
businesses in North Carolina. Progress Energy Carolinas sells
power to about 1.3 million, according to the company website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
