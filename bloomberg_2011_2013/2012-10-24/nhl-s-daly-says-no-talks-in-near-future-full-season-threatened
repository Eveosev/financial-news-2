A full National Hockey League season
is in jeopardy because there are unlikely to be talks this week
between team owners and the players’ union on a new labor
contract, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said.  When Commissioner Gary Bettman offered to split revenue 50-
50 with the players last week, he said the union would have to
approve the plan by tomorrow to schedule a full season with the
Stanley Cup Playoffs in June.  The union, which made three counteroffers that were
rejected by the NHL on Oct. 18, tried to resume discussions
yesterday on a new collective bargaining agreement.  “The union has rejected the proposal we made last Tuesday
and is not offering another one,” Daly said, according to the
 Associated Press . “We see nothing to be gained at this point by
meeting just to meet.”  Daly has said throughout negotiations that the union has
tended to avoid the topics at the center of the dispute,
including revenue sharing and players’ salaries.  The old labor agreement expired Sept. 15. The following day,
the league imposed a lockout which led to the cancellation of
the preseason and regular-season games through Nov. 1.  The league may announce additional cancellations by the end
of the week if there is no progress in negotiations, the
Washington Post reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
