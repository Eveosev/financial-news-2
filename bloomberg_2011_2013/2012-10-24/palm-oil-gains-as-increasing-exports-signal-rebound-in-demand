Palm oil  advanced to the highest
level in almost four weeks after  China  reported increased
imports, estimates from  Malaysia  showed rising shipments and
analysts including Oil World forecast a rally.  The contract for January delivery advanced 1.5 percent to
2,578 ringgit ($842) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest close for the most-active contract since
Sept. 27. Futures lost 15 percent since the end of August as
palm-oil stockpiles expanded to a record in Malaysia.  “Demand is kicking in again,” James Ratnam, an analyst at
TA Securities Holdings Bhd., said by phone in Kuala Lumpur
today. “The price has been low for the past one month.”  China, the biggest cooking-oil user, increased imports to
531,564 tons in September from 457,498 tons a month earlier,
data showed. In the first 20 days of October, shipments from
Malaysia gained 17 percent to 1.05 million tons from the month
earlier period, Societe Generale de Surveillance said Oct. 22.  Futures will gain to 2,775 ringgit by year-end, according
to the median of 13 analyst and trader estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Prices may rally to 3,300 ringgit by March or April
as global vegetable-oil demand outpaces consumption, researcher
Oil World said yesterday.  Rising imports by  Europe  showed biodiesel demand was
picking up before the winter months, said TA’s Ratnam. Shipments
to the European Union more than doubled to 308,176 tons in the
first 20 days of October from September, SGS said.  Soybean oil for December delivery climbed 0.6 percent 51.61
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
January delivery gained 0.6 percent to $15.6575 a bushel. Palm
and soybean oils are substitutes in food and fuel uses.  Palm oil for May delivery gained 1.3 percent to end at
7,330  yuan  ($1,173) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month rose 0.7 percent to
