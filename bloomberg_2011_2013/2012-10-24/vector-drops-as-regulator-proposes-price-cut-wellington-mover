Vector (VCT)  Ltd., which distributes gas
in New Zealand’s biggest city, fell the most in 3 1/2 years
after the industry regulator said it will have to cut prices
from next year.  Under the preliminary ruling, Vector will have to drop its
gas distribution prices by an average 16 percent, while charges
for using its high-pressure gas pipelines that transmit gas from
elsewhere in the North Island must be cut by 25 percent, the
Auckland-based company said in a statement. The shares tumbled
5.2 percent, the biggest drop since April 1, 2009.  Vector is in dispute with the Commerce Commission, which
regulates gas and electricity distributors, saying its decisions
will stall investment. The company has already begun court
action to review the commission’s methodology.  “We are concerned at the commission’s approach to
investment in gas transmission and distribution,” Chief
Executive Officer Simon Mackenzie said in a statement. “We find
it difficult to reconcile the decision against the Minister of
Energy’s view of the criticality of the gas infrastructure in
New Zealand and the need to ensure that those assets remain in
excellent condition.”  Vector fell 15 cents to NZ$2.75 at the 5 p.m. market close
in Wellington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
