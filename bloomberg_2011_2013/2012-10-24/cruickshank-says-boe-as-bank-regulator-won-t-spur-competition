Donald Cruickshank, the former
chairman of the  London Stock Exchange (LSE) , said new powers handed to
the  Bank of England  to regulate banks will do little to improve
competition.  Cruickshank said the central bank’s Prudential Regulation
Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority won’t have
competition as a primary objective and that will lead to inertia
in promoting choice for consumers.  “If that authority does not have a competition objective,
then it is very likely, in my view, that competition will be
muted,” Cruickshank told a parliamentary hearing on banking
standards in London today. “It’s easier for the regulator and
regulated if competition is muted.”  Cruickshank, who wrote a government-commissioned report on
the U.K.’s banking industry more than a decade ago, said his
findings had been stifled by the Treasury. He said today said he
is “gloomy” about new banks entering the U.K.  “It will be extraordinarily difficult for a new entrant to
come into this market,” Cruickshank told lawmakers. “The
promotion of competition is going to have to come from primary
legislation.”  All regulatory functions should be taken away from the
regulated, Cruickshank said in a written note to the commission.
“The Libor scandal is just the tip of the iceberg here,” he
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
