Yuan  forwards traded at the deepest
discount to the onshore spot rate in three weeks as renewed
speculation Europe will be unable to contain its debt crisis
added to concern the global economy is deteriorating.  Spain’s borrowing costs rose yesterday after the central
bank said the nation’s recession will worsen in coming months.
There are signs short-term capital inflows to China increased
due to monetary easing in the U.S. and Europe, Zhang Monan, a
researcher with the State Information Center, wrote in a
commentary in the  China Daily  today. A preliminary reading on
China’s manufacturing activities in October was 49.1, from a
final level of 47.9 last month, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics said today.  “The risk-off sentiment sparked by  Spain  is weighing on
the yuan today,” said Stella Lee, Hong Kong-based president at
Success Futures & Foreign Exchange Ltd. “Yet we continue to see
inflows into China positioning for a growth rebound, which will
support the currency in the near term.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.08 percent
to 6.3710 per dollar as of 4:33 p.m. in  Hong Kong , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts traded at a 1.9
percent discount to the spot rate in Shanghai, which was
unchanged at 6.2480 as the China Foreign Exchange Trade System
prices showed. That’s the biggest gap since Oct. 3.  The currency has advanced 0.7 percent this year, after
rallying 4.7 percent in 2011. The yuan will appreciate slower
than most people think, Bert Hofman, the  World Bank ’s chief
economist for  East Asia  and the Pacific, said today.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  at 6.3081
per dollar today, just shy of 6.3078 yesterday. The currency can
trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency gained 0.05
percent to 6.2485 per versus the greenback, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility for the onshore yuan, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
