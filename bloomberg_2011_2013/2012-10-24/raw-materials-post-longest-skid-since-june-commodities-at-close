The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  fell 0.4 percent to settle at 636.75
at 4 p.m. in New York. The measure dropped for the fourth
straight session, the longest slump since mid-June.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  declined 0.2
percent to 1,566.89.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cotton fell, capping the biggest two-day slump since mid-
August, on concern that supplies will remain ample as the
slumping European economy crimps demand.  In the year ending July 31, production will exceed
consumption by a record 79.11 million bales, up 14 percent from
the surplus a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said this month. In October, euro-area services and
manufacturing output contracted more than economists forecast,
and German business confidence unexpectedly dropped.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, cotton for December
delivery slid 2.2 percent to 72.67 cents a pound. In two days,
the price dropped 5.5 percent, the most since Aug. 13. A bale

percent to $1.108 a pound.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery advanced 0.2 percent
to 19.68 cents a pound.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fell below $1,700 an ounce to a six-week low as

buy  government bonds  “will not lead to inflation.”  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for December
delivery traded at $1,702.60 at 4:47 p.m. The metal settled at

to $592.75 an ounce. The price dropped for the fifth straight
session, the longest slump since May 9.  BASE METALS  Copper futures fell, capping the longest slide since
August, as a bigger-than-expected contraction in Euro-area
services and manufacturing added to concern that metals demand
will slow.  On the Comex, copper futures for December delivery declined
less than 1 percent to $3.568 a pound. The metal dropped for the
fifth straight session, the longest slump since Aug. 30.

normal stockpile increase for last week.  On the Nymex, gas futures for November delivery fell 2.4
percent to $3.45 per million British thermal units.  U.K. gas for same-day delivery declined, snapping a five-
session advance, as imports from  Belgium  rose to the highest
rate in 21 months.  The price dropped 3.6 percent to 66.5 pence a therm at 4:16
p.m. London time after reaching 69 pence yesterday, the highest
since February. Month-ahead gas slid 2 percent to 67.15 pence a
therm. That’s equivalent to $10.76 per million Btu.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil dropped, capping the longest slump in five
months, after U.S. inventories rose more than expected and fuel
demand dropped.  On the Nymex, oil futures for December delivery fell 1.1
percent to $85.73 a barrel. The price dropped for the fifth
straight session, the longest skid since May 18.  Brent oil for December settlement traded in  London  fell 0.4

plans to increase exports of its Kirkuk grade in November from
the Turkish port of Ceyhan to 24 lots, four more than this
month, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline fell, extending the longest slump since the start

the highest in almost two months.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures slipped 0.1 percent to
$2.603 a gallon. The price dropped for the 10th straight session.  Heating-oil futures for November delivery slid 0.1 percent
to $3.0394 a gallon.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat rose to the highest in three weeks as dry weather

advance since Oct. 11. Earlier, the grain reached $8.95, the

1.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 0.2 percent to
$7.545 a bushel, the third straight drop.  LIVESTOCK  Hogs gained for the first time this week as animal weights
declined in the U.S., signaling tighter supplies of pork.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog futures for
