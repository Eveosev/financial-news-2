An  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  affiliate that
owns a contaminated former acid-factory site in Richmond,
California, sought U.S. bankruptcy protection.  Cherokee Simeon Venture I LLC, which uses AstraZeneca’s
U.S. headquarters address in Wilmington, Delaware, cited about
$50 million each in assets and debt in papers filed yesterday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington.  Officials determined that “it is desirable and in the best
interests of the company, its creditors” and related parties to
seek Chapter 11 protection, Brian Spiller, Cherokee manager,
wrote in court papers.  The waste site, along San Francisco Bay, was developed in
1897 by Stauffer Chemical Co., later Bayer CropScience Inc., to
make sulfuric acid, and until the 1970s was also used to produce
agricultural products including fertilizer, according to a 2005
maintenance plan submitted to the  California  Environmental
Protection Agency.  Through a series of deals, chemical maker Zeneca Inc., an
AstraZeneca unit, acquired the site and sold it to Cherokee in
2002. The 31-acre plot was capped with a cement mixture and
Cherokee was ordered by state environmental officials to
maintain the cap.  Toxins found at the site or in groundwater include arsenic,
DDT, lead, copper, mercury, nickel and vinyl chloride, according
to the California agency.  Zeneca Inc. is listed in court papers as an unsecured
creditor owed as much as $42.9 million.  The case is In re Cherokee Simeon Venture I LLC, 12bk12913,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
