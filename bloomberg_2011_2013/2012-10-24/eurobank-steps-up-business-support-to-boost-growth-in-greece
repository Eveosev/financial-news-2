EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  presented a
plan to boost financing to Greek businesses and exporters as the
country enters its fifth straight year of recession.  “The goal is to help businesses successfully manage the
challenges of international competition,” Athens-based Eurobank
said in an e-mailed presentation today. The lender is working
with groups including Go International and exportgate.gr to help
companies in industries including tourism enter new export
markets, such as Moscow, according to a  presentation .  Greece’s cash-starved economy is set to shrink for a fifth
straight year in 2012 under the weight of austerity measures
tied to two bailouts from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund. National Bank of Greece SA made a bid earlier
this month to acquire Eurobank,  Greece ’s second-biggest lender,
which would make the new group the country’s biggest bank.  More than 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) of loans have been
granted since 2009 to groups operating in industries including
tourism, export-driven businesses and renewable energy, the
Eurobank said in the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
