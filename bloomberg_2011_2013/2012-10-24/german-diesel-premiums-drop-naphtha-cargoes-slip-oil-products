European diesel traded while the premium for the product in
Germany dropped. Trafigura Beheer BV sold  naphtha  cargoes for a
seventh session.  French oil refinery workers plan to hold a strike on Nov.
5, according to a union official.  Light Products  Naphtha declined to trade from $923 to $927 a ton,

crude and products broker. That’s the least since Oct. 8.  Barges of gasoline for loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp hub traded at $930 to $946 a ton, according to a survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and
Platts. That compares with deals yesterday from $950 to $959 and
is the lowest since June 28, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Morgan Stanley,  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  sold the Eurobob grade, to

2,000 tons. Gunvor Group Ltd. both bought and sold.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , rose to $3.34
a barrel, the PVM data showed. That’s up from $3.16 yesterday.  Middle Distillates  Glencore International Plc sold a cargo of ultra-low-sulfur

$18.67 a barrel as of 4:30 p.m. Brent decreased 0.9 percent to

at the moment due to strong middle distillate cracks and the
recent restart of the Ingolstadt refinery,” Vienna-based
researcher JBC Energy GmbH said in a note today.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded from $595.50 to $596.25 a ton,

a ton, up from $624 to $625 yesterday.  The  spread  between the two grades widened to $32 a ton. It

according to Bloomberg data.  Refineries  French oil refinery and terminal workers will hold the
strike on Nov. 5, Chris Votte, an official at the CGT union said
by phone today. The staff are protesting against the possible
closure of the Petit-Couronne refinery, he said.  Mineraloelraffinerie Oberrhein GmbH halted for maintenance
an alkylation unit at its 310,000 barrel-a-day Karlsruhe
refinery, the largest in  Germany , two people with knowledge of
the work said.  The unit was shut earlier this month for work that includes
a column change and will remain offline for at least four weeks,
the people said, declining to be identified because they’re not
authorized to speak publicly about the matter.  OMV Petrom SA,  Romania ’s biggest oil company, will halt its

following its upgrade, Bertram Muchan, head of operations
management in the company’s refining division, said at a
conference in Bucharest today.  Naftna Industrija Srbije AD, a Serbian oil and gas company,
