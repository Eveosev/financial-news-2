The euro area’s debt burden rose to
a record in the second quarter as governments across the
currency bloc struggled to contain the fiscal crisis.  Government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product
rose to 90 percent from 88.2 percent in the first quarter, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the highest since the euro was introduced in 1999 and
above the EU limit of 60 percent of GDP.  The euro has gained about 3.4 percent against the dollar
over the past two months after European officials stepped up
their crisis response and the  European Central Bank  unveiled a
program to purchase sovereign debt. Still, governments may
struggle to plug their budget deficits and lower the debt burden
as the region’s economic slump shows signs of deepening. Euro-
area manufacturing and service industries contracted this month
and German  business confidence  fell, reports showed today.  Twenty EU member states reported an increase in their debt-
to-GDP ratio from the first quarter, while six had a decrease
and one country’s debt remained stable, today’s data showed.
 Greece , which sparked the fiscal crisis, had the highest debt
burden at 150.3 percent of GDP at the end of June, up from 136.9
percent, followed by Italy at 126.1 percent and  Portugal  at
117.5 percent. Ireland, which also received aid, reported a debt
level of 111.5 percent, up from 108.5 percent at the end of the
first quarter.  In  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, the debt burden rose
to 82.8 percent of GDP from 81.1 percent. Estonia had the lowest
level in the 27-nation EU at 7.3 percent.  Loans accounted for 18.6 percent of euro-area government
debt at the end of the second quarter, while currency and
deposits made up 2.8 percent. Securities other than shares made
up the largest part, or 78.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
