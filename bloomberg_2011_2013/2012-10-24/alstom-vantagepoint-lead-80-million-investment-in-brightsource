BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) , the U.S.
solar-thermal developer that canceled plans for an initial
public offering, received $80 million in equity investments led
by its two  biggest backers  to expand its operations into new
regions.  Alstom SA, Europe’s second largest power-equipment company,
led the investment round with the venture capital company
VantagePoint Capital Partners, Oakland, California-based
BrightSource said today in a statement.  Alstom also agreed to collaborate with BrightSource on
solar-thermal power projects in India and Australia, advancing a
2010 partnership focused on Africa and the Mediterranean region.
 Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest power-equipment maker, said Oct. 22
it’s seeking a buyer for its solar-thermal operation.  The financing comes six months after BrightSource withdrew
its IPO registration, citing adverse market conditions. The
company is almost 60 percent done with its first commercial-
scale power plant, the 377-megawatt Ivanpah project in southern
California. It completed a 29-megawatt demonstration facility
for  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  in Coalinga, California, last year that
generates steam for enhanced oil recovery.  The financing also included existing backers Draper Fisher
Jurvetson, DBL Investors LLC,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
California State Teachers’ Retirement System and the venture
capital units of Chevron and  BP Plc (BP/) , according to the statement.  BrightSource’s solar-thermal systems use mirrors to focus
sunlight on a boiler atop a central tower, generating steam that
drives a turbine and creates electricity.  Alstom and VantagePoint owned 19.9 percent and 24 percent
of BrightSource, respectively, as of March 30, according to a
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
