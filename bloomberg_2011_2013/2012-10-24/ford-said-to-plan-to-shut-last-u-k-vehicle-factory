Ford Motor Co. (F) , seeking to stop
losing money in Europe, intends to close its van plant in
Southampton, England, its last vehicle-making factory in the
U.K., said two people familiar with the automaker’s plans.  The factory, which employs 534 workers, will probably close
when Ford ceases production of the current version of the
Transit commercial van as early as next year, said the people,
who asked not to be identified revealing internal plans.
Southampton produces Transit chassis cabs that can be customized
into various commercial vehicles.  Southampton’s closing may precede the 2014 shutdown of
Ford’s car and van plant in Genk,  Belgium , which the automaker
announced today. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford’s vehicle
factories in Europe are operating at 63 percent of capacity,
according to Morgan Stanley. Southampton last year built fewer
than 30,000 vehicles, using less than one-third of its capacity,
according to IHS Automotive.  “It’s brave and it’s decisive,” Adam Jonas, an analyst
with Morgan Stanley who rates Ford overweight, said yesterday of
the automaker’s plant closures in Europe. “It shows the
confidence of the leadership of the company to get it done while
there’s a crisis going.”  Ford has said it will lose more than $1 billion in Europe
this year as car sales fall to near a 20-year low. The sovereign
debt in Europe has sapped  consumer confidence .  John Gardiner , a spokesman for Ford, didn’t immediately
respond to requests for comment.  Sky News  reported on the planned shutdown earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
