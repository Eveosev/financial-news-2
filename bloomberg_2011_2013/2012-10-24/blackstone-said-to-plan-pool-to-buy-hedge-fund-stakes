Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the New York
investment firm with $205 billion in assets, is planning a fund
to buy stakes in hedge-fund managers as it continues to expand
beyond private equity.  The new fund may seek between $2 billion and $3 billion,
according to a person familiar with the plans who asked not be
named because the fund hasn’t been formally launched.  Christine
Anderson , a spokeswoman for New York-based Blackstone, declined
to comment.  Chairman  Stephen Schwarzman  has bolstered Blackstone’s
offerings in hedge funds, credit and real estate as the market
for traditional corporate takeovers wanes. The new effort would
expand Blackstone’s hedge-fund unit, a $46.2 billion business
managed by J. Tomilson Hill.  Blackstone President  Tony James  alluded to a new hedge-fund
product last week during the firm’s quarterly earnings call with
investors. He spoke about Blackstone’s existing business backing
startup hedge funds.  “We have a fund that seeds new hedge-fund managers and by
doing that owns a piece” of the management company of the fund,
he said on the Oct. 18 call. “We have a new product we’re
working on which we’ll be announcing shortly.”  Plans for the new fund were reported earlier today by
Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
