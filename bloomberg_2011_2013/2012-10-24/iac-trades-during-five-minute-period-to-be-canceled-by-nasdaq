Trades in  IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI)  that
occurred when the stock was supposed to be halted earlier today
will be canceled by the Nasdaq Stock Market, the exchange said.  The operator of websites such as Ask.Com and Match.com
 plunged  as much as 14 percent to $45.06 after it forecast an
operating loss in its media and other segments, setting off a
halt at 11:34 a.m.  New York  time that is triggered by extreme
price swings. At least 14 trades that mostly occurred 18 seconds
after 11:34 have been canceled, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Between 11:34:17 and 11:39:15 a.m., shares of IAC were
“subject to a trading pause and no trades should have
occurred,” Nasdaq, a unit of New York-based  Nasdaq OMX Group
Inc. (NDAQ) , said on its  website . The decision isn’t subject to appeal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
