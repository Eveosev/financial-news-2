TNK-BP, a venture between  BP Plc (BP/)  and
a group of billionaires, doesn’t expect Eurobond holders to be
hurt by OAO Rosneft’s plan to buy the company for $54.8 billion.  “We do not foresee any potential negative impact on
Eurobond holders in situation of the envisaged change of
control,” TNK-BP spokeswoman Oksana Gavshina said by e-mail.  Moody’s Investors Service placed TNK-BP’s Baa2 debt rating
on review for possible downgrade on a lack of information about
the structure of $28 billion of funding for the deal, said Julia
Pribytkova, a Russia oil and gas analyst at the rating company.  Rosneft said this week it will buy BP’s 50 percent in TNK-
BP for $26.8 billion in cash and shares and has an initial deal
to acquire the billionaires’ half for $28 billion in cash.  To contact the reporters on this story:
