European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ardo Hansson said governments’ efforts to contain
the debt crisis are encouraging and should sustain an
improvement in investor sentiment.  “These changes rest on fundamentals,” Hansson, who heads
 Estonia ’s central bank, said in an interview in Tallinn today.
“There’s better fiscal policy in the euro area, there is
progress on structural reforms, pan-European institutions are
being built up and the ECB is playing its role. It’s all based
on something and that gives me more confidence.”  At the same time, “I wouldn’t be so confident to say we’re
out of the woods completely and we’re now on a permanently
different path,” he said.  Financial markets have rallied since ECB President  Mario Draghi  pledged to do whatever it takes to safeguard the euro and
announced unlimited bond purchases. European leaders are also
working on a blueprint for the future of monetary union that
includes centralized banking supervision. Still,  Spain  is
resisting making a request for a fully-fledged bailout that
would trigger ECB purchases of its bonds.  “There are a lot of players in this game,” Hansson said.
At the ECB, “we just focus on monetary policy transmission”
and  price stability .  If the new bond-purchase program is implemented “the way
it is proposed, including all the modalities and the
conditionality, I think it is up to others to make their
decisions in that changed framework,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
