Juhayna Food Industries (JUFO) , Egypt’s
largest publicly traded producer of packaged milk, rose the most
in almost two years as the company announced a 29 percent profit
gain.  Shares advanced 2.3 percent to 6.14 pounds at the close in
Cairo, the highest since December 2010, after the company said
nine-month profit rose to 240 million pounds ($39 million)
compared with 185.7 million pounds in the same period last year.  “We’re expecting their growth to accelerate by the end of
2013 and into 2014,” Hany Genena, head of research at Pharos
Securities Brokerage, said by phone. “They’re investing heavily
in distribution centers and their yogurt factory is expected to
start producing in the third quarter of 2013.”  Juhayna said in September its distribution unit secured a
medium-term loan of 150 million pounds from Barclays Plc  Egypt 
for expansion in the North African country. Profit may surge 32
percent this year to 245 million pounds, according to the mean
estimate of seven analysts on Bloomberg.  Seven of nine analysts have a buy  recommendation  and two
have a hold recommendation, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
