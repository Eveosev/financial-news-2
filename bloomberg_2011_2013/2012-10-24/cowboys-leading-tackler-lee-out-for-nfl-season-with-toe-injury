Dallas  Cowboys’ leading tackler Sean
Lee will miss the rest of the National Football League season
because of a toe injury that will require surgery.  Cowboys punter Chris Jones, who has missed two of the last
three games with a left knee injury, joined Lee in being placed
on the team’s injured reserve list, the Cowboys said on their
website.  Lee, a 26-year-old linebacker in his third year with
Dallas, has torn ligaments in his right big toe. He leads the
team with 58 total tackles.  Brian Moorman, who has filled in for Jones, will remain the
Cowboys’ punter, while safety Charlie Peprah and linebacker
Ernie Sims were signed to fill the open roster spots.  The Cowboys (3-3) host the National Football Conference
East Division-leading  New York  Giants (5-2) on Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
