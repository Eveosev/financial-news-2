Defunct brokerage  Lehman Brothers
Inc ., which hasn’t paid  hedge funds  after four years in
liquidation, has brought institutional customer claims “to the
brink of a 100 percent distribution” that must await court 
approval of settlements struck with affiliates, the trustee said.  Trustee James Giddens, who is facing payment demands by New
York hedge fund Elliott Management Corp., controls $13.5 billion
in cash and $12.5 billion in securities, he said in a report
filed today in  bankruptcy court  in Manhattan. The brokerage has
spent $812.5 million liquidating since its parent filed the
biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008, including
fees to lawyers and consultants of more than $704 million.  Giddens earlier this month agreed to settle disputed claims
with Lehman Brothers International Europe, after striking an
accord with a Swiss affiliate. He is working to resolve
differences with the parent company, Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., he said in the report.  The brokerage and its parent have been disputing for years
the claims filed against them, with some of the largest coming
from former affiliates. The Lehman parent made its first payment
of $22.5 billion to creditors last April, about 3 1/2 years
after filing the biggest U.S. bankruptcy in history on Sept. 15,
2008, and a second payment this month of $10.2 billion. The
brokerage collapsed four days after the parent and is being
separately liquidated by Giddens.  Giddens transferred most of the brokerage’s retail accounts
to  Barclays Plc (BARC)  in 2008.  The Lehman brokerage liquidation is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
parent’s case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
