Roswell’s city council agreed to
apply for a state loan to build a $16 million treatment plant to
provide its residents with another water option besides Fulton
County, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.  Mayor Jere Wood said Roswell, which gets about 80 percent
of its water from Fulton County, needs to protect itself by
having its own water system and not be subject to price rises
when “a monopoly” has no competition, the paper reported.  Roswell’s sewer treatment plant is 80 years old so the
council voted 6-0 to apply for a new facility through a low-
interest Georgia Environmental Finance Authority loan, the paper
said. Only those residents served by the new plant would pay on
the 20-year loan, or about $1 more a month on their water bill,
city officials told the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
