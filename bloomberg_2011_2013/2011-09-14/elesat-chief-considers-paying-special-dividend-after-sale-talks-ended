Telesat Holdings Inc. may pay
investors a special dividend after a sale of the world’s fourth-
largest satellite company fell through.  “It would be nice for shareholders to realize some of
Telesat’s value, so we may recapitalize the business and then
pay a special dividend,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Goldberg said in an interview at an industry conference in
Paris. The company, based in Ottawa, may borrow money to make
the payment, he said, adding that the current “turbulence” in
markets will be taken into account.  Telesat, co-owned by  Loral Space & Communications Inc. (LORL)  and
Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board, weighed
takeover offers from  EchoStar Corp. (SATS)  and Carlyle Group, people
with knowledge of the matter said in March.  “We got a couple of real, credible offers, but our
investors decided they would not sell because they still see
significant value in Telesat,” Goldberg said.  Loral said on Aug. 4 that none of the offers “was
acceptable” and ended talks with potential buyers.  Loral rose 2.5 percent yesterday to $56.71 in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The shares have dropped 26 percent this year.  Telesat owns 12 operational satellites and has 3 under
construction. Its largest customer is  BCE Inc. (BCE) , Canada’s biggest
provider of mobile phone, Internet and satellite TV services.  To contact the reporters on this story:
