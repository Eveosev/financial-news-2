German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said that while markets are the most efficient means
of creating wealth in an economy, they can also be irrational
and therefore need regulation.  “Markets are the best means of finding solutions, but
they’re not always rational” and can destroy themselves,
Schaeuble said today in a speech in Berlin. “That’s why they
need rules and bounds.”  It is the job of the government to create an order that
promotes, rather than hinders, moral behavior, Schaeuble also
said at an event organized by the Catholic Academy in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
