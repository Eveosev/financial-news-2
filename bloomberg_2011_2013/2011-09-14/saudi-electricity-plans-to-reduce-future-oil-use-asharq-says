Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO)  is investing
5 billion riyals (1.3 billion) in technologies that will allow
it to increase output without burning more crude oil, Asharq al-
Awsat reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Ali Al Barrak.  Barrak told the London-based pan-Arab daily that the
company successfully raised  energy efficiency  at its PP10 power
plant south of the capital Riyadh by 50 percent without
consuming more crude oil. The state-owned utility will continue
implementing this at other plants, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
