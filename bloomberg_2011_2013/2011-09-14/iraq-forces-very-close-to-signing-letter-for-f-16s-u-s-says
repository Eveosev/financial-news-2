Iraq  is "very close" to signing a
letter of intent to buy up to 36  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  F-16
jets, said the senior U.S. Air Force general in that country.  Major General Russ Handy told reporters at the Pentagon
that Iraq would buy a first installment of 18 aircraft, with a
potential total of 36.  “These are very modern aircraft,” Handy, commander of the
9th Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force-Iraq, said. “They
should have fairly modern capabilities. It’s a multi-role
fighter.”  The best case for first delivery is late 2013, he said.  The agreement is awaiting signature of a formal “letter of
offer and acceptance” that signals an Iraqi government
commitment to purchase a specified number of aircraft, the cost
and payment schedule, Handy said. “We are hearing very
encouraging words.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
