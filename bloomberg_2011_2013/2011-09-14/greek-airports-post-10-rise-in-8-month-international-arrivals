International arrivals at Greek
airports rose 10 percent in the first eight months of 2011 from
the same period a year earlier, according to data collected from
13 airports by the  Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises.   Passenger arrivals from abroad increased to 8.7 million in
the period, from 7.9 million over the same period a year
earlier, the Athens-based association said in a statement posted
on its website today. The biggest increases were on the islands
of Rhodes and Kos, which each saw a rise of 24 percent, followed
by the Heraklion airport on Crete which had a 13 percent
increase to 1.7 million, the data showed.  Athens International Airport ,  Greece â€™s biggest, was the
only one to record a drop in arrivals from abroad in the eight-
month period despite increases in the last four months,
according to the statement. The number of international
passengers landing at the airport rose 2.7 percent to 1.2
million in the peak tourist season months of June through
August, the statement showed.  In the month of August, international arrivals climbed 9.3
percent to 2.2 million. Data were collected from the 13 airports
that are responsible for about 95 percent of all arrivals by air
from abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story
