European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said a default by  Greece 
would have ’’dramatic’’ consequences.  “Whatever way you look at it, it is absolutely certain
that a default and/or exit of Greece from the euro zone would
carry dramatic economic, social and political costs not only for
Greece but also for all other euro-area member states,” Rehn
told the European Parliament today in Strasbourg,  France .  To contact the reporter on this story:
