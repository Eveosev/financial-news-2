Wheat futures rebounded from a
five-week low on speculation that demand will increase from
livestock producers seeking an alternative to higher-priced corn
as a feed grain.  Wheat futures for December delivery were 21 cents a bushel
cheaper than the comparable corn contract yesterday in  Chicago ,
the biggest discount since at least 1959. Wheat usually trades
at a premium to corn. About 240 million bushels of wheat will be
in feed and residual use this year, 80 percent more than last
year, the U.S. estimated on Sept. 12. Corn prices have gained 46
percent in the past year after adverse weather hurt the U.S.
crop.  “We’ll see more switching to wheat for feed purposes” at
current prices, Frank Cholly Sr., a senior market strategist at
MF Global Holdings Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “We should see demand pick up.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 2.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $7.045 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the first gain since Sept. 2. Yesterday,
the price touched $6.96, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Aug. 9. The commodity has dropped 4.3 percent in the past
12 months.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
