BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , an  oil company 
working with Vitol SA at  Cameroon ’s Etinde permit, will link
offshore fields its developing using pipelines to a hub on land
rather than deploying floating storage units as it had planned.  The company is preparing designs that would link the IF, IE
and Sapele oil and gas discoveries in shallow waters to a hub at
Limbe in southwest Cameroon, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Hart
said. It will drill at least four wells to appraise reserves
next year and may pump its first oil in the first half of 2015.  “We’ve just moved to this more pragmatic approach,” Hart
said in an interview in  London . “The intention will be to
sanction the development of these fields in the first or second
quarters of 2013.”  BowLeven, based in Edinburgh,  Scotland , will invest about
$400 million in the project, which initially will pump about
15,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The company will need to
sell gas to the planned  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA-led liquefied natural gas
plant or inject the fuel back into reservoirs before ramping up
output to about 50,000 barrels, possibly in 2016, Hart said.  The company will complete its Sapele-3 well this month and
plans to resume drilling next year. It will have $60 million in
cash remaining, according to a presentation published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
