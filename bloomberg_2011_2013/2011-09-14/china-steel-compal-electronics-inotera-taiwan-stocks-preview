Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei.  The Taiex Index fell 162.9 points, or 2.2 percent, to
7,228.47, the lowest close since June 10, 2010. It’s the second-
worst-performing stock market in  Asia  after  South Korea  today.  Catcher Technology Co. (2474 TT), which makes metal casings
for computers and mobile phones, slumped 6.8 percent to NT$213,
the biggest loss since Aug. 25, after UBS AG said there’s
speculation HTC Corp. may reduce demand for the company’s
products.  “Catcher has a very balanced customer base and won’t be
impacted by an individual customer,” James Wu, Catcher
spokesman, said by phone from Taipei. “We saw record sales in
August and the trend of using metal casings in the industry will
continue.” He declined to comment on specific clients.  Compal Electronics Inc. (2324)  (2324 TT) lost 1.1 percent to
NT$28. The laptop maker said August sales fell 17 percent from a
year earlier to NT$54 billion ($1.82 billion), according to a
statement to the  Taiwan Stock Exchange .  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317 TT) dropped 2.9
percent to NT$67.30, the lowest close since Aug. 29. The world’s
largest contract manufacturer of electronics was unable to raise
NT$6 billion in a bond auction, according to four people with
knowledge of the matter. The company didn’t get the prices it
wanted for the five-year unsecured notes, the people said.
 Edmund Ding , a spokesman for Taipei-based Hon Hai, didn’t answer
a call to his mobile phone today.  Wistron Corp. (3231)  (3231 TT) retreated 1.9 percent to NT$33.90.
The laptop maker was cut to “neutral” from “overweight” at
HSBC Holdings Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
