Czech central bank board member
Kamil Janacek said the difference between the  European Central
Bank ’s rate and the Czech one isn’t large enough to cause
problems yet,  E15  reported, citing an interview with Janacek.  Czech lawmakers should consider the possibility of making a
“cyclically balanced” budget a part of the country’s
constitution, the newspaper said, citing Janacek. While a budget
deficit must be allowed during an economic decline, there should
always be a surplus during the growth years, E15 reported the
banker as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
