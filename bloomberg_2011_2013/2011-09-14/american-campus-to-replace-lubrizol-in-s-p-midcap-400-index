American Campus Communities Inc. (ACC) 
will replace  Lubrizol Corp. (LZ)  in the Standard & Poor’s MidCap 400
Index after the close of trading on Sept. 16, S&P said in a
statement today.  The change is being made because Lubrizol is being acquired
by Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , S&P said.  Austin, Texas-based American Campus Communities, which has
a market value of $2.7 billion, operates on- and off-campus
housing properties near colleges and universities. Its shares
rose 2.7 percent to $40.10 in late trading at 5:23 p.m. in  New
York .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
