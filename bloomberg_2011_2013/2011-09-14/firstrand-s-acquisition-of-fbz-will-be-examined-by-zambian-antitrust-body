Zambia’s Competition Commission
plans to investigate the acquisition of Finance Bank Zambia Ltd.
by  South Africa ’s  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)   FirstRand’s Zambian unit  First National Bank  bought the
Zambian lender for 27 billion kwacha ($5.5 million) on Sept. 12,
according to Zambia’s central bank, which had seized control of
Finance Bank last year for breaching financial laws.  “Now that the Bank of Zambia has found a buyer, we will
have to look at what kind of competition FirstRand, through
First National Bank, may bring about on the Zambian banking
sector,” Chilufya Sampa, chief executive officer of the
antitrust authority, said by phone today from the capital,
Lusaka.  The regulator has 90 days to carry out the investigation,
Sampa said, adding that the size of FirstRand’s existing
business in Zambia means that “I don’t see any problem with
them getting the approval.”  First National will add 39 branches with the acquisition,
which will make it the country’s fifth-largest bank, Central
Bank Governor Caleb Fundanga said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
