Taiwan ’s dollar declined for an
eighth day, the longest losing streak since February 2009, as
 Europe ’s deepening debt crisis spurred investors to favor safer
bets than emerging-market stocks. Bonds gained.  Foreign funds sold $328 million more Taiwan stocks than
they bought today, bringing net sales this week to $841 million,
according to exchange data. The currency touched a six-month low
before a report next week that will show export orders, an
indication of shipments in the next one to three months, rose
7.6 percent in August from a year earlier, compared with an
increase of 11.1 percent the previous month, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  “Lingering worries over the euro zone’s debt problems
seem to be weighing on investor sentiment,” said Emmanuel Ng, a
currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in
 Singapore . “This is probably causing selling of Asian
currencies.”  Taiwan’s dollar dropped 0.5 percent to NT$29.625 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.700 earlier, the
weakest level since Feb 25.  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.953 percent in
Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market.  Yields declined 27 basis points from this year’s high of
1.21 percent reached on July 29 to a record low 0.94 percent on
Sept. 6, as the faltering global economic recovery boosted
demand for the perceived safety of sovereign debt. The  Central
Bank  of  China  (Taiwan) will meet on Sept. 29 to review the
discount rate after raising it twice this year, by 12.5 basis
points each time, to 1.875 percent.  “Bond yields went down tremendously because of
speculation our central bank won’t raise the rate at the end of
September,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
