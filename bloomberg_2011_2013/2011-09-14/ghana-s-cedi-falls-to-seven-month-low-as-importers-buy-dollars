Ghana ’s cedi weakened to a seven-
month low against the dollar as airline operators converted
earnings and importers sought the U.S. currency to pay for
goods.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated as much as 1 percent to 1.5633 per dollar and traded  down 0.8 percent to 1.5600 by 1:36 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, the weakest intraday level since Feb. 7.  “Most passengers pay for tickets in cedis, but airlines
operate in a global economy, so we saw some converting earnings
to dollars today,” Kevin Adarkwa, a currency trader at the
local unit of Standard Chartered Bank Plc, said in a telephone
interview. “Manufacturers also bought the dollar to bring in
raw materials while the commerce industry sought it to import
goods for resale.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
