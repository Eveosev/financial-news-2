Hungary ’s government expects
150,000 to 300,000 people to make use of a plan that allows
borrowers to repay foreign-currency mortgages below market
rates, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said.  Hungary plans to enable early repayment of mortgages
denominated in Swiss francs or euros at as much as 20 percent
below prevailing rates, Orban told parliament two days ago. The
European Union said the proposal may violate its rules and
Standard and Poor’s, which rates Hungary one step above junk,
said the plan may hurt lending, growth and public finances.  “The number of those with the necessary savings who will
decide to get out of their loans may be somewhere between
150,000 and 300,000,” Orban told HirTV in an interview late
yesterday. The figure may rise as borrowers seek help from
friends and family and search for other assets, he added.  Two-thirds of Hungarian mortgages are denominated in francs
and defaults have risen as the Swiss currency’s advance sent
monthly installments soaring. The loan plan is “unacceptable”
and poses a “significant threat” to the financial industry,
the Hungarian Banking Association said Sept. 12.  The forint dropped 0.8 percent to a one-year low of 287 per
euro as of 10:01 a.m. in Budapest. It fell 0.7 percent to 237.9
against the franc, declining for a fourth day.  ‘Nothing to Lose’  The loan plan will impose a time limit for participation so
banks can calculate the impact on profits, Orban said. Hungary
has “nothing to lose” because foreign lenders have already
been withdrawing money from the country and some international
banks will still find it profitable to remain, he added.  Investors should sell forint for euros as the Hungarian
currency may weaken to 295 in the “near term” because of the
plan,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  strategist  Gyula Toth  said today by e-mail.  The government expects companies to challenge the plan in
European courts, with potential legal costs to be borne by the
state rather than borrowers, Orban said.  “The forint may stay under pressure,”  Bartosz Pawlowski ,
a strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  London , said today by e-mail.  OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary’s largest lender, was little
changed at 3,640 forint, after losing 15 percent in the previous
three trading sessions. OTP bought back 100,000 of its own
shares yesterday at an average of 3,646 forint each, according
to a statement today on the Budapest Stock Exchange website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
