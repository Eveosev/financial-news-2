Chilean students are preparing to
march in downtown Santiago this morning after they received city
permits to host a demonstration, the University of  Chile â€™s
student federation, known as Fech, said on its  website .  The demonstration is meant to pressure authorities to
improve the quality and reduce the cost of schooling after talks
between student leaders and the government stalled this week,
the Fech said in a  statement  yesterday.  Student leaders are asking the government to withdraw
education bills that are now before Congress before they will
agree to continue talks with Education Minister Felipe Bulnes
that started Sept. 3, Fech President Camila Vallejo said in the
statement.  Tens of thousands of protesters have been marching
throughout Chile on an almost weekly basis over the past three
months. Students and labor unions at the end of August staged a
two-day strike that ended in violence as police and protesters
clashed, resulting in the death of a 16-year-old boy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
