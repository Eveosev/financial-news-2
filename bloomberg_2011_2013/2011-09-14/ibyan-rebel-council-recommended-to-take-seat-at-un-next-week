The National Transitional Council
should represent  Libya  at the  United Nations  General Assembly
next week, in what would be a major step toward international
acceptance of the rebel group that deposed dictator  Muammar Qaddafi , the UN Credentials Committee decided today.  The committee will recommend to the president of the
General Assembly that the NTC be accredited, according to
Alberto Aleman of Panama, who chairs the panel. The 193 UN
members will make the final decision on Sept. 16, General
Assembly President Nassir al-Nasser of Qatar told reporters
yesterday.  NTC Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril likely will head the
Libyan delegation to the UN, al-Nasser said. Jibril is scheduled
to address the General Assembly on Sept. 27.  Al-Nasser also said that Mohammed Shalgham, who was
Qadaffiâ€™s ambassador to the UN until his defection on Feb. 26,
will return to the same post. Shalgham is a former Libyan
foreign minister under Qaddafi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
