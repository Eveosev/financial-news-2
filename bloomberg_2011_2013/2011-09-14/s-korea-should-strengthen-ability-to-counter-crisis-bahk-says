South Korea  needs to strengthen its
ability to counter a crisis as global debt woes will likely last
long, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said. Investors shouldnâ€™t
worry about the Korean economy as the nation has sufficient
foreign exchange reserves, fiscal soundness, and manageable
short-term external debt, Bahk said at a government meeting
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
