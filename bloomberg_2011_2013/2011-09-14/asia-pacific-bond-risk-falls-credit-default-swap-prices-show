The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 9.5 basis points to
195 basis points as of 3:50 p.m. in Sydney, according to
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 6 basis points to 179 basis points
as of 1:26 p.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 2 basis points from the
opening to 166 basis points as of 2:50 p.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup
Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
