Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields higher for a fourth day, before a debt swap this month in
which the government plans to repurchase short-term local
securities in exchange for debt due between 2015 and 2026.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent benchmark bonds due in
July 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
7.33 percent at 3:08 p.m. New York time. That’s its highest
level on a closing basis since Sept. 1. The bond’s price fell
0.254 centavo to 121.713 centavos per peso.  Yields on the benchmark bonds have risen 15 basis points
since the government on Sept. 9  announced its plan  to buy back
as much as 39.5 trillion pesos ($22 billion) worth of local
securities as it seeks to issue new debt maturing in August
2026. The  Finance Ministry  on Sept. 20 will seek to repurchase
peso bonds due April 2012, August 2012, April 2013, November
2013 and May 2014, and offer in return peso debt due October
2015, October 2018 and August 2026, it said in a statement.  “The market has been adjusting to the swap announcement,”
said Daniel Lozano, an analyst at Serfinco SA brokerage in
Bogota. “Now what it’s waiting for is the conditions that will
be offered.”  The Finance Ministry will announce the yields at which it
will offer the securities at 9 a.m. New York time on Sept. 20.  Colombia canceled its weekly auctions of peso bonds, known
as TES, scheduled for today and Sept. 21 ahead of the bond swap.
The next debt auction will be carried out Sept. 28, according to
a presentation from the ministry.  Colombia’s peso fell 0.8 percent to 1,826.75 per dollar,
from 1,813 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
