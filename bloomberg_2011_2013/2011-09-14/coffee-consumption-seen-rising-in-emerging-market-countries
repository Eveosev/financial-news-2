Emerging market and producing
countries will account for more than 50 percent of all the
coffee consumed in the world by 2020, according to P&A Marketing
International.  Usage in these countries currently makes up 42 percent to
43 percent of total world consumption, Carlos Henrique Jorge Brando, director of the Rio de Janeiro-based research company,
said today in an interview in Antwerp,  Belgium .  “About 85 percent of the consumption increase between now
and 2020 will be coming from producing countries and emerging
markets,” Brando said.  World coffee consumption will be 136 million 60-kilogram
(132-pound) bags in the 2011-12 season starting next month,
 Andrea Thompson , head of research and analysis at researcher
CoffeeNetwork said yesterday. Usage totaled 134.8 million bags
in 2010, the  International Coffee Organization  said in its
August report.  Coffee consumption has grown at an average annual rate of
4.2 percent in producing countries and 3.5 percent in emerging
markets over the past 5 years, said Brando, whose company also
represents Pinhalense SA in Brazil, the world’s top maker of
coffee-processing equipment.  Brazil  could overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest
coffee consumer in the next 3 years, he added.  “As producing countries become more important they will
put pressure on prices” because they will export less, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
