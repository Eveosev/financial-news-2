Slovak nuclear plants operated by a
unit of  Enel SpA (ENEL)  are safe, the countryâ€™s watchdog said, citing
initial results of stress tests.  Slovakia has two functioning nuclear plants in Mochovce and
Jaslovske Bohunice, both operated by Slovenske Elektrarne AS, in
which Enel holds 66 percent. Two additional reactors at the
Mochovce site are under construction.  The designs of the plants are able to cope with extreme
natural events, the Office for Nuclear Supervision in
Bratislava, Slovakia, said in a preliminary  report  posted on its
web site.  The tests were prescribed by the European Commission after
the March accident at the Fukushima plant in  Japan  and their aim
to is to assess regional reactor safety in case of events such
as earthquake or disruption of water supply. A final report is
due by the end of the year, the office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
