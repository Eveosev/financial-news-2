CEZ AS (CEZ) ’s Chief Executive Officer
Martin Roman will leave his job at his own request and will
become the head of the utility’s supervisory board, spokesman
Ladislav Kriz said today when reached by telephone.  Roman, who has been at the helm of CEZ for over seven
years, will be succeeded by Daniel Benes, the company’s chief
operating officer,  Lidove Noviny  reported on its website, citing
a person close to Prime Minister Petr Necas. CEZ spokesman Kriz
neither confirmed nor denied the report that Benes will succeed
Roman.  The Czech state controls 70 percent of CEZ, the country’s
largest power producer. The utility is in the process of
choosing a supplier for the construction of two nuclear reactors
at its Temelin power plant. Areva SA, Westinghouse Electric Co.
LLC and the Russian-Czech consortium led by ZAO Atomostroyexport
are competing for the contract that could be worth as much as
$12 billion.  CEZ will make an announcement about Roman’s successor
tomorrow, Kriz said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
