Niger  arrested army Colonel
Abdoulaye Badie, the former second-in-command of the military
junta that ousted President  Mamadou Tandja  and ruled until
March, said police Lieutenant Sidikou Mamadou.  Badie was arrested about two days ago and is being held at
the headquarters of the army in the capital, Niamey, Mamadou
said by phone today. He declined to give a reason for the
arrest.  In October, Badie was arrested, questioned and released by
the then-ruling military administration. He had been the body’s
permanent secretary until General Djibo Salou, who ruled the
junta, abolished the post four days before his arrest.  Salou led the February 2010 ouster of Tandja, who attempted
to extend his rule by changing the country’s constitution. In
March, Mahamadou Issoufou won a runoff election to become leader
of  Africa ’s second-largest uranium producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
