Samsung Electronics Co., the
world’s second-largest maker of mobile phones, and Genting Bhd
are among 10 firms whose credit-default swaps will be cut from a
new version of  Asia ’s benchmark bond risk index from Sept. 20.  The Markit iTraxx Asia ex- Japan  investment-grade index will
have the number of constituents reduced to 40 from 50 when the
latest series of the gauge starts trading, according to
information on index provider Markit Group Ltd.’s website.  Australia ’s index of 25 companies will remain unchanged
while three firms will be replaced in the Markit iTraxx Japan
index, the  website  states.  New series of the benchmarks are created every six months
when companies are added or dropped depending on their ratings,
cost of protection and ease of trading.  In Japan’s index, default-swap contracts on Chubu Electric
Power Co., Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. and Softbank Corp. will
replace Canon Inc., Komatsu Ltd. and Mitsui Chemicals Inc.,
according to Markit.  The other credit-default swaps to be removed from the Asian
gauge insure the debt of Cathay United Bank Co., Malayan Banking
Bhd, MISC Bhd, MTR Corp., PTT PCL, SK Energy Co., SP PowerAssets
Ltd. and the Hong Kong government, according to Markit’s
website.  An Asian index of contracts on 20 junk-rated companies
won’t roll to a new series, the website states.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
$10 million of debt from default for five years is equivalent to
$1,000 a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
