Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-biggest airline, advanced to the highest level in
almost a week after saying it plans to increase its share
capital to fund expansion.  The stock gained 0.5 shillings, or 1.6 percent, to 31
shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the
strongest level since Sept. 8.  The proposed offer will be presented to shareholders at a
meeting on Oct. 14, the Nairobi-based company said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday.  “The story of growth is interesting to investors because a
capacity constraint has been one of the reasons the airline has
not been able to expand very fast,” Gregory Waweru, an analyst
at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East  Africa  Ltd., said in a
phone interview today.  The company agreed to buy 10 aircraft from Embraer SA and
signed an option to acquire another 16 from the Brazilian
manufacturer, Chief Executive Officer Titus Naikuni said Aug.
