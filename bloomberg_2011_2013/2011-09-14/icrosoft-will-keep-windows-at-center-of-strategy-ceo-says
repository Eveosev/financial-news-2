Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  will keep its
Windows operating system at the heart of its strategy as the
company revamps the software to work with new types of computing
devices, Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer  said.  “Windows is at the center,” Ballmer said at Microsoft’s
annual analyst meeting in Anaheim, California. “I can read a
lot of places where people question whether that is a good idea.
I think it’s an exceptionally good idea.”  While Microsoft has to “re-imagine” Windows, the company
has no reason not to build on the brand and technological
strength of the product, Ballmer said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
