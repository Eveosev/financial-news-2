Bwin.party digital entertainment
Plc and  Betfair Group Plc (BET)  advanced in  London  trading after the
German state of Schleswig-Holstein passed rules that open the
region to online sports-betting companies.  The 46-to-45 vote breaks from Germany’s other 15 states,
which had sought a nationwide framework for betting after the
European Union’s top court last year ruled that the country’s
betting monopoly didn’t comply with European laws. Bwin.party
climbed 9.1 percent, and Betfair 3 percent.  Betfair said it welcomed the step, which allows for an
unlimited number of licenses for sports betting, poker and some
casino games, plus a less onerous tax regime than that proposed
by the other German states. The rules proposed by the 15 states
would limit licenses to seven, and would place a 17 percent tax
on betting stakes, while the Schleswig-Holstein rules tax gross
profit, and provide for an unlimited number of licenses.  “This represents the opening up of  Germany  to online
gaming, in due course, on reasonable commercial terms,” Ivor Jones, an analyst for Numis Securities, wrote in a note to
investors. “At worst, it will greatly delay the introduction of
a more restrictive regime.”  Betfair said in an e-mailed statement it welcomed the rules
as ‘creating a genuinely open, transparent and responsible
gambling market in Germany.”  Bwin.party rose 10.4 pence to 124.4 pence in London.
Betfair rose 20.9 pence to 720 pence, erasing earlier losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
