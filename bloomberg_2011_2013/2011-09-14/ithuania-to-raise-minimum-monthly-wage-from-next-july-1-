Lithuania’s government plans to
raise the minimum monthly wage by 6.3 percent from next July,
three months ahead of a general election, Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said.  The monthly wage will rise to 850 litai ($337.4) from the
current 800 litai, Kubilius told journalists in Vilnius today.  The increase on the minimum paycheck, the lowest in the
Baltic region, “will have a neutral effect on the  budget
deficit ,” Giedre Balcytyte, spokeswoman for the  Finance
Ministry , said by phone. Average wages are expected to rise 5.5
percent next year, the  ministry  estimates.  “This seems a reasonable plan, going hand in hand with the
developments in the labor market,” said Vilija Tauraite, a
Vilnius-based economist with SEB Bank AB. “It will help
increase consumer power and compensate for rising prices. Yet
you can’t miss that it does fall nicely along with election
campaign.”  Lithuanians will head to the polls in October 2012.  Estonia’s minimum wage is 278 euros ($380.8), while minimum
paychecks in  Latvia  stand at 200 lati ($386).  To contact the reporter on this story:
