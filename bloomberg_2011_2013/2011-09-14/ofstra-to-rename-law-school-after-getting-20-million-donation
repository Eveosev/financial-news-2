Hofstra University received a $20
million donation, the largest in its history, from Maurice
Deane, who entered the law school at age 50 and graduated first
in his class after more than two decades in the  drug industry .  Hofstra is renaming its law school for Deane, who graduated
in 1981, the university in Hempstead,  New York , said today in an
e-mailed  statement .  Deane retired as president of the company now called Endo
Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., the maker of the painkiller
Percocet, before entering law school. While he was at Endo, the
company was acquired by DuPont-Merck Pharmaceutical Co. Endo,
based in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, began trading publicly in
2004. Deane served as a Hofstra trustee from 1982 to 2007.  “Maurice holds a very special place in the history and
development of the law school,” Hofstra President Stuart Rabinowitz said in the statement. “The naming of a school after
an individual is among the highest honors a university can
bestow.”  Hofstra, founded in 1935, is a private university with
about 12,000 students. Graduates include  Francis Ford Coppola ,
the movie director; Peter Kalikow, the former chairman of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and  Bernard Madoff , who
pleaded guilty in 2009 to running the biggest Ponzi scheme in
history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
