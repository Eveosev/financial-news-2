Anglo American Plc (AAL)  plans to start
construction work at its $3 billion Quellaveco copper deposit in
 Peru  next year, country manager Luis Marchese said.  The company is negotiating water rights with the local
community for the mine, which may produce 200,000 metric tons a
year, Marchese said today at a conference in the southern city
of Arequipa. Anglo will also drill 100,000 meters at its
Michiquillay copper deposit to define reserves, Marchese said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
