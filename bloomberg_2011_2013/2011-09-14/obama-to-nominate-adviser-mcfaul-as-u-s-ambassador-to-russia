 President  Barack Obama  will
nominate Michael McFaul, his chief adviser on Russia, to be the
next U.S. ambassador to the Russian Federation, the White House
announced.  McFaul is the senior director of Russia and Eurasia Affairs
for the White House National Security Staff and often travels
with the president.  Before joining the administration, McFaul was a political
science professor at Stanford University from 1995 to 2009. He
received his bachelors and masters degrees from the school where
he studied international relations, Slavic languages and Russian
and East European studies.  He also was a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace in  Washington , directing the
Russian Domestic Politics Program from 1998 to 2001. He served
in the same position in the Moscow Carnegie Center in 1994 and
1995.  The nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate.  He would replace John Beyrle, a career foreign service
officer who was nominated for the post by then-President  George W. Bush  in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
