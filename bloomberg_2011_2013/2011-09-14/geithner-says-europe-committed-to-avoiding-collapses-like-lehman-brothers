U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said “there is no chance that the major countries of
 Europe  will let their institutions be at risk in the eyes of the
market.”  Geithner, speaking at a conference in  New York  today, said
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly said “we are not
going to have a  Lehman Brothers ,” a reference to the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, which deepened the
financial crisis.  “I think she recognizes that they’ve got to do some more
to make sure that they make that commitment credible to the
world,” Geithner said at the Delivering Alpha conference
broadcast on CNBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
