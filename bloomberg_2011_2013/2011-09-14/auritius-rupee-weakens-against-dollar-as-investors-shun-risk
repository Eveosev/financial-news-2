Mauritius’s rupee weakened versus
the dollar as  Europe ’s debt crisis sapped investor appetite for
riskier frontier-market assets.  The currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 28.75 per dollar at
3:17 p.m. in Port Louis, the capital. Against the euro, the
rupee fell for a second day, dropping 0.7 percent to 39.4595.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  holds a conference
call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy amid speculation Greece will default. Europe is
the main buyer of Mauritian manufactured goods and the largest
source of tourists to the country, led by France, according to
the  Central Statistics Office .  “The drop is in line with the worldwide foreign exchange
trends,” said Fabien Gebert, treasurer at GML, an investment
group that says it is Mauritius’ largest by assets.  The Indian Ocean island nation, with a population of 1.3
million people, earns 41 percent of its foreign currency in
euros, Bank of Mauritius data show.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.7284 to 27.8998
and the selling price increased to 29.2126 compared with 29.1518
on Sept. 13, according to  exchange rates  published today on the
Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
