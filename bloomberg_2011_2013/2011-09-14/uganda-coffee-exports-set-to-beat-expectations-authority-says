Uganda ,  Africa ’s second-biggest
coffee producer, may export more beans in 2010-11 than expected
on a good crop in the southern and southwestern regions, the
Uganda Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments may rise to more than 3 million 60-kilogram (132-
pound) bags in the year ending Sept. 30, an official at the
authority, who declined to be named because he isn’t authorized
to speak for the agency, said by phone from Kampala, the
capital.  A drought earlier this year forced the agency to cut the
forecast for 2010-11 from 3.1 million to 2.6 million bags in
April. The authority is now raising it to just over 3 million
bags, the official said.  Exports in the 2011-12 season, which starts Oct. 1, may be
as much as 3.1 million to 3.2 million bags, he said, adding the
crop has recovered.  Shipments this month may climb 47 percent to 250,000 bags,
up from 169,728 bags a year earlier. Last month 309,303 bags
were sent as the southern and southwestern regions had a good
end to the season, the official said. The eastern and central
regions harvest the main crop from October to March.  Exports from the start of the season on Oct. 1, 2010,
through August climbed to 2.8 million bags, from 2.5 million
bags a year earlier, according a tally of the authority’s
figures by Bloomberg.  Uganda ranks behind  Ethiopia  as the continent’s largest
exporter of coffee, according to the  International Coffee
Organization .  Robusta beans, used in instant coffee, account for about 85
percent of the East African nation’s annual production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
