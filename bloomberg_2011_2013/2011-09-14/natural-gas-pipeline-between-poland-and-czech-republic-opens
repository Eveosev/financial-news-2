A natural-gas pipeline connecting
 Poland  and the  Czech Republic  with capacity of 500 million cubic
meters a year opened today, according to the country’s pipeline
operator, Gaz System.  The 32-kilometer (20-mile) link, built jointly with Czech
company Net4Gas, follows a European Union strategy to connect
energy markets. Poland is also seeking pipeline connections
before it starts a liquefied natural gas terminal on the Baltic
Sea coast in 2014.  “The two companies are considering increasing the capacity
of the interconnector to 2.5 billion cubic meters per year and
enabling it to ship gas in both directions, given its role in
integrating and liberalizing gas markets in this part of
 Europe ,” Gaz System said in a statement posted on its website.  In January, the company will expand its existing link with
 Germany  by 600 million cubic meters a year, said Malgorzata Polkowska, a Warsaw-based spokeswoman for  Gaz System . Contracts
to ship gas via the larger pipeline will be signed this month,
she said.  The company received a record 28 offers from potential
importers, including European gas traders, chemical producers
and energy utilities for the additional capacity on the German
border connection. The operator also plans to build gas
connections with Slovakia and Lithuania.  Earlier this month, Poland’s  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA (PGN)  said that its joint venture with Verbundnetz Gas
AG was studying building another link to Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
