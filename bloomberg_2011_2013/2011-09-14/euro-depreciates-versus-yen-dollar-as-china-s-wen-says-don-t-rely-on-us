The euro weakened versus the yen
for a fifth day and fell against the dollar on concern  China 
won’t buy assets to support Europe’s highly indebted economies
amid mounting concern of a default by Greece.  The Japanese currency rose against all 16 major peers, and
the dollar gained versus all but one, as U.S. stock futures
declined. China’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  signaled developed nations
should cut deficits and create jobs rather than relying on his
country to bail out the world economy.  “Looking at the news flow overnight it’s hard to find
anything there that you would cite as being a positive for the
euro zone,” said  Simon Derrick , chief currency strategist at
Bank of New York Mellon in London. “My overall view is that
pressure will be very much to the downside for the euro.”  The euro bought 104.93 yen at 9:30 a.m. in  London , from
105.25 yesterday. The shared currency was at $1.3636, from
$1,3678 and the dollar was little changed at 76.90 yen, from
76.96.  To contact the reporters on this story:
