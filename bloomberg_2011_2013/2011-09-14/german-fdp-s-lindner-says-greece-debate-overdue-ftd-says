A debate on the possibility of
 Greece ’s default is overdue and shouldn’t be suppressed,
Christian Lindner, general secretary of  Germany ’s Free
Democratic Party, was quoted as saying by the Financial Times
Deutschland in an  interview .  The comments signal the FDP’s rebuff of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s call for choosing one’s words carefully in talking
about the debt crisis, the newspaper said. The Free Democrats
are Merkel’s junior coalition partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
