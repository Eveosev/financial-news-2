Workers at  Freeport-McMoRan Copper
& Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Grasberg mine in  Indonesia  will proceed with a
planned one-month strike starting at midnight because of
continued disagreement over pay, a union official said.  PT Freeport Indonesia  and Grasberg’s labor union held two
meetings in the past week but failed to agree on wage increases,
said Virgo Solossa, head of organizational affairs at the labor
union. Grasberg is located in Mimika, Papua province, 1,940
miles (3,120 kilometers) east of Jakarta.  “We don’t see any sincerity from the company on resolving
the pay issue and coming up with a new offer,” Solossa said by
telephone today from Timika, the closest town to the mine.
“We’ve obtained permits from the regent and chief of police for
the strike.”  About 8,000 non-staff workers at Grasberg’s production,
delivery and mining divisions will put down tools at midnight,
Solossa said.  Freeport and Grasberg’s labor union ended 38 days of talks
over 2011-2013 contract terms on Aug. 26 after failing to agree
on wages. Negotiations started after the workers walked off from
their jobs for eight days in July. Employees at Freeport’s
Peruvian unit also plan to proceed with a strike today after
talks on pay broke down.  A strike at Grasberg and in  Peru  can potentially widen a
global production shortfall of copper estimated at 670,000
metric tons this year by  Barclays Capital  and boost prices of
the metal in  London  that have fallen more than 14 percent from a
record $10,190 a ton on Feb. 15.  Grasberg Workers  Copper for three-month delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$8,749.75 a ton on the London Metal Exchange at 10:09 a.m.
Jakarta time.  “The management expects the workers to cancel the strike
plan and return to the negotiation table because the law gives
them room to continue negotiation,” Ramdani Sirait, a Jakarta-
based spokesman at Freeport, said in a text-message. He declined
to comment on the impact of the strike on production and sales.  The workers still expect wages to increase to between
$17.50 and $43 an hour from $1.50 to $3.50, Solossa said today.
The union cut their expectations from $35 to $200 an hour
initially, he said Aug. 26. Freeport offered a compensation
package that includes an increase in basic wages for non-staff
employees of 22 percent over a two-year period, Sirait said on
Sept. 5.  Grasberg, where operations started in 1990, contains the
world’s largest recoverable reserves of copper and the biggest
 gold reserves , according to Freeport’s website. Copper
production at the mine fell to 1.22 billion pounds (553.4
million kilograms) last year from 1.41 billion pounds in 2009,
according to the website. Gold output declined to 1.79 million
ounces (50,745 kilograms) from 2.57 million ounces.  To contact the reporters on this story:
