About 10 banks are processing
credit approvals to join the $315 million loan backing China’s
Bright Food Group Co.’s acquisition of a controlling stake in
Australia’s Manassen Foods, according to a person familiar with
the matter.  The banks are considering joining the three-year loan as
senior lenders with commitments of $50 million each, said the
person who asked not to be identified because details are
private. The loan may be signed after senior syndication and it
may not be marketed more widely in general syndication, the
person said.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  and  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  are arranging and underwriting the loan, the
person said. The facility will pay a margin of 170 basis points
more than the London interbank offered rate for a so-called all-
in fee of 210 basis points to lenders committing $50 million or
more, another person familiar with the matter said on Sept. 5.  Bright Food, China’s second largest food company, said last
month it had signed a deal to buy a 75 percent stake in Manassen
Foods, which makes Albatros bread and Harringtons chocolates,
from Champ Private Equity. The state-owned Chinese company aims
to have as much as 30 percent of total sales from overseas
markets in five years, Chairman Wang Zongnan said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
