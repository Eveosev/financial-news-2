Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 4 p.m. local-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  fell 75.75 points, or 2
percent, to 3,799.04, declining for a fourth straight day.  Banks: PT Bank Mandiri (BMRI IJ),  Indonesia ’s biggest bank
by assets, fell 5.8 percent to 6,450 rupiah and PT Bank Central
 Asia  (BBCA IJ), the largest by market value, retreated 4.3
percent to 7,750 rupiah.  The shares fell after Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor
Hartadi Sarwono said yesterday the economy may expand less than
forecast next year because of the European debt crisis,
according to Bagus Hananto, an analyst at PT Onix Capital in
Jakarta.  Energy-related companies: PT Bumi Resources (BUMI IJ),
Asia’s biggest exporter of power-station coal, dropped 3.7
percent to 2,625 rupiah. PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS IJ), the
nation’s largest distributor of gas, lost 2.7 percent to 2,725
rupiah, set for the lowest close since May 26, 2009.  Oil futures dropped as much as 1.9 percent to $88.53 a
barrel in after-hours trading in  New York , on course for the
first loss in three days. A lower oil price reduces the appeal
of alternative fuels such as coal and gas.  PT Duta Pertiwi Nusantara (DPNS IJ), a producer of glue and
chemical products, rose 24 percent to 880 rupiah, the highest
close since at least August 1991. Duta Pertiwi discovered
potential coal reserves of 150 million to 200 million metric
tons following a survey of a 500-hectare area in Jambi province,
President Director Siang Hadi Widjaja said. The stock has gained
91 percent in the past three days.  PT Timah (TINS IJ), Indonesia’s biggest tin producer, fell
2.3 percent to 2,125 rupiah. Tin futures retreated 1.7 percent
to $23,250 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
