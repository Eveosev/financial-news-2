Brazil ’s government is willing to
forfeit 1 billion reais ($583 million) in 2012 oil royalties to
reach an agreement with Congress and state governments on how to
divide crude tax revenue,  Folha de S. Paulo  reported without
saying where it got the information.  President Dilma Rousseff’s administration is also
requesting that oil producing states forfeit a similar amount of
royalties to reach a deal with non-producing states who are
seeking an increased percentage of oil revenue, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
