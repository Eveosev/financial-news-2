The following is an English
translation of a statement made by Government spokesman and
Minister of State Elias Mosialos after a conference call between
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou , German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy today, received by
e-mail from Mosialos’s Athens office.  “The complete implementation of the July 21 decisions is
the common will of Prime Minister George Papandreou, President
Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel.  “In response to the rumors of the recent days it was
emphasized by all that Greece is an integral part of the
eurozone.  “Greece is determined to meet all its commitments to its
partners, ensuring in this way the full implementation of the
support program.  “The decisions taken by the Cabinet in recent days and the
additional measures announced lead to meeting fiscal targets for
2011 and 2012 and the creation of primary surpluses. This will
fortify the  Greek economy , relieve the public debt burden and
reinforce the country’s growth prospects.”  For Related News and Information:
