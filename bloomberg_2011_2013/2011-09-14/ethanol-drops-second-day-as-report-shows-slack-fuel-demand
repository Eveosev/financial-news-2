Ethanol futures fell for a second
day in  Chicago  after a government report showed a drop in demand
for the additive.  Futures declined after the Energy Department report showed
fuel use plunged 3.8 percent to 18.7 million barrels a day last
week, the lowest level since the week ended July 22. Ethanol is
blended with gasoline to stretch supply and meet federal
mandates.  “The wheels on the wagon are very loose,” said Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk Management Inc. in  Dallas .
“A lack of demand is the problem for ethanol and the whole
crude-oil family.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 1.3 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.722 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 15 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  slumped 6 cents,
