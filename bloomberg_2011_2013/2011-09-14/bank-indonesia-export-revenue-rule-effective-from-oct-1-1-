Bank Indonesia’s  requirement that
companies place export revenue and foreign loan proceeds in
domestic banks will help to reduce volatility in the rupiah,
Governor Darmin Nasution said in Jakarta today.  The central bank expects the rule will add an average of
$29.5 billion of foreign-currency reserves to  Indonesia ’s
banking system each year, Perry Warjiyo, Bank Indonesia’s
director of economic research, said today.  “At least we won’t be as dependent on portfolio investment”
for foreign exchange, Nasution said. The rule will help Bank
Indonesia to stabilize the rupiah, he added.  The central bank will issue the new rule at the end of this
month and it will take effect Oct. 1, Nasution said. There will
be a sanction-free transition period from Oct. 1 until January
for companies to report revenue and proceeds, he said.  Exporters will have to deposit funds generated overseas
with domestic banks maximum within six months of the transaction
in 2012 and within three months in 2013, Warjiyo said. Companies
that receive foreign loans will be required to transfer the
funds to domestic lenders by the 10th of the following month,
said Nelson Tampubolon,  Bank Indonesia ’s director of
international directorate.  Editors: Andrew Janes, Reinie Booysen  To contact the reporter on this story:
