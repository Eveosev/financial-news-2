     Sept. 14 (Bloomberg) --  CIT Group Inc. (CIT)  will focus on
expansion, Chief Executive Officer  John Thain  said, as the
small-business lender reverses its strategy of shrinking the
balance sheet since exiting bankruptcy almost two years ago.  “We do absolutely want to focus on growth,” Thain, 56,
said today at an investor conference hosted by Barclays Plc in
New York. “Our assets, our balance sheet have been shrinking.
We want to reverse that trend.”  Thain, the former CEO of Merrill Lynch & Co., has sold
assets to help CIT, once the biggest independent commercial
lender in the U.S., recover from a bankruptcy that wiped out
$2.3 billion in government bailout money. Assets at the New
York-based company totaled $48 billion in the second quarter,
down 17 percent from $58.1 billion in the first quarter of 2010
after the company exited bankruptcy.  CIT rose 9 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $32.78 at 10:27 a.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares fell 31
percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
