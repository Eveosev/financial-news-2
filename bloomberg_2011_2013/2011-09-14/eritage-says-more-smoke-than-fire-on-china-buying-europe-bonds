Derek Scissors, a research fellow
for economics at the Washington-based Heritage  Foundation  think-
tank, comments on Europe’s debt crisis. He made the comments in
an e-mail to Bloomberg News late yesterday.  Italian officials met in the past month with delegates from
sovereign wealth fund  China  Investment Corp. to discuss
investments, adding that bonds weren’t the focus, a government
official familiar with the matter said on Sept 12. Talks
addressed only potential “industrial investments,” Deputy
Economy Minister Antonio Gentile said in an e-mail on Sept. 13.  “You can’t solve a debt problem by borrowing more money,
no matter how hard people want that to be true.  “There is more smoke than fire on Chinese purchases of
European bonds. Because China’s balance-of-payments surplus has
expanded, it is likely there have been expanding Chinese
purchases of Spanish and other national bonds.  “But the increases come from a base of almost nothing and
still constitute relatively small amounts -- in the billions
rather than the tens of billions, much less hundreds of
billions.  “There has not been a noticeable increase in the share of
euro-denominated assets in Chinese holdings in the past three
years. Nor have we seen any evidence of large inflows in market
behavior.  “The Chinese come bringing diplomatic gifts which, given
the size of their foreign exchange reserves, can look
impressive. They are not actually betting on  Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
