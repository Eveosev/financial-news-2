Roger Altman , chairman and founder
of  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  and a former U.S. deputy Treasury
secretary, said Congress will approve portions of President
Barack Obama’s $447 billion jobs plan.  “Part of the proposal the president has made will be
enacted, particularly the payroll tax cuts,” Altman, 65, said
today in a Bloomberg Television interview with Lisa Murphy and
 Matthew Miller . “I think the Republicans will ultimately
support those.”  A majority of Americans doesn’t think Obama’s jobs plan
will help lower the  unemployment rate , a Bloomberg National Poll
conducted Sept. 9-12 shows. Altman said the plan will have a
“positive impact” on economic growth and jobs. Cutting the
nation’s deficit will require a mix of spending cuts, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
