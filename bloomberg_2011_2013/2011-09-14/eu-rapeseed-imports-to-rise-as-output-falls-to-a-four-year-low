Rapeseed production in the European
Union will fall 8.9 percent to a four-year low as German output
declines, boosting the need for imports into the bloc, Hamburg-
based researcher Oil World said in a report.  EU output will fall to 18.7 million metric tons in the
marketing year that started on July 1, down from 20.5 million
tons the prior 12 months, according to the report, released
yesterday. Imports from April through June rose to a record
917,000 tons, up from 272,000 during the same period a year
earlier, Oil World said.  “The European Union is becoming more dependent on imports
owing to insufficient domestic production,” the researcher
said. “This week we have made another downward revision of this
year’s EU-27 rapeseed crop. In fact, it cannot be excluded that
actual production even drops to or below 18.5 million tons.”  Rapeseed futures on NYSE Liffe in Paris gained 0.2 percent
to 444.50 euros ($609) today. The price is up 5.5 percent in the
past month on lower production caused by dry weather through
June.  Production in  Germany , last year’s biggest EU producer, may
fall 28 percent to 4.1 million tons through June, Oil World
said. Polish output may fall 18 percent, according to the
report. EU imports for the marketing year may rise 21 percent,
the researcher said. Stockpiles on June 30 will total 1.07
million tons, down 25 percent, Oil World data show.  Australia  shipped 1.1 million tons to the EU in the year
through June, up from 314,000 tons. The bloc also imported
216,000 tons from  Canada , up from 95,000 tons the prior year,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
