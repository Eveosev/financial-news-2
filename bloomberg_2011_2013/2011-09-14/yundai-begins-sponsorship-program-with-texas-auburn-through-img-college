Hyundai began a sponsorship program
that features vehicle and information displays during football
games at 15 universities, including Ohio State,  Texas  and
defending national-champion Auburn.  Hyundai Motor America reached the agreement through  IMG
College , a division of the management and marketing agency IMG
Worldwide. Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed in a news
release. It’s the largest U.S. sports sponsorship for  Hyundai
Motor America , which has headquarters in Costa Mesa,  California ,
and is a subsidiary of South Korea-based  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)   Hyundai’s agreement comes two weeks after United Parcel
Service Inc., the world’s biggest package-delivery company,
added 68 schools to its sponsorship program through a
partnership with IMG College.  Hyundai will bring vehicle and information displays to 64
football games this season at Ohio State, Texas and Auburn,
along with Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida,
Florida State, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Oregon, Pittsburgh,  South
Carolina  and Virginia Tech. The company said it plans to add
nine more IMG partner schools next season.  Hyundai will have on-campus and in-stadium displays,
marketing and hospitality, in addition to on-field promotions.  IMG College is the nation’s largest collegiate sports
marketing company, acquiring and consolidating media rights for
more than 200 schools over the last several years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
