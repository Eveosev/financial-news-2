U.K. employment in government jobs
fell by a record in the second quarter, offsetting a gain in
hiring by companies, as the government cuts spending to reduce
the  budget deficit .  Public-sector payrolls plunged 111,000 in the three months
through June, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in
London. In the private sector, employment rose 41,000. In
August, jobless benefit claims increased 20,300, less than the
35,000 that was the median forecast of 23 economists in a
Bloomberg News Survey.  The Bank of England held its key  interest rate  at a record
low of 0.5 percent and its bond program at 200 billion pounds
last month. Still, policy maker  Adam Posen  said yesterday the
outlook for the economy has worsened and his colleagues should
back his call for more stimulus to counter headwinds to growth.  The claimant-count rate was 4.9 percent in August and the
number of people on jobless benefits was 1.58 million. The
British economy grew just 0.2 percent in the second quarter from
the previous three months and gauges of factory, services and
construction growth all declined in August.  “If we do not undertake the stimulative policy that the
outlook calls for, then our economies and our people will suffer
avoidable and potentially lasting damage,” Posen said. “The
right thing to do right now if the  Bank of England  and the other
Group of Seven central banks to engage in further monetary
stimulus.”  The statistics office said that about 14,000 of the public
job losses reflected the end of work during the 2011 census.  The ILO unemployment rate in the three months through July
was 7.9 percent. On that measure, the number of unemployed
people increased by 80,000 to 2.51 million.  Employment in the private sector may come under pressure as
banks cut jobs. The biggest global banks are cutting jobs at the
fastest pace since 2008 as a slowing world economy squeezes
revenue, regulators push firms to hold more capital and the
euro-zone sovereign debt crisis shows no sign of ending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
