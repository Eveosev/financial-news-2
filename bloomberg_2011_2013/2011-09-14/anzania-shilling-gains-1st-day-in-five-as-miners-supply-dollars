Tanzania’s shilling climbed for the
first time in five days against the dollar as mining companies
converted holdings of the greenback to make payments.  The currency of East  Africa ’s second-biggest economy gained
as much as 0.9 percent to 1,624.5 per dollar, the most since
Aug. 22, and traded up 0.2 percent at 1,638.5 by 1:04 p.m in Dar
es Salaam, the commercial capital.  “We have had inflows of dollars mainly from the mining
sector this morning which explains the appreciation of the
shilling,” Zainul Chandoo, head treasurer of Stanbic Bank
Tanzania Ltd., Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s local unit, said by
phone from Dar es Salaam. “We also had some inflows from non-
governmental organizations today.”  Tanzania vies with Mali to be Africa’s third-biggest
producer of gold after Ghana and  South Africa  and has the
world’s only known deposit of tanzanite, a rare gem.  To contact the reporter on this story:
