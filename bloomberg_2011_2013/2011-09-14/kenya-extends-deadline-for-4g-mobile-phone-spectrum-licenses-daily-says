Kenya â€™s government extended the bid
period for fourth-generation mobile-phone spectrum licenses
after failing to attract any bids, Business Daily reported,
citing Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Bitange Ndemo.  The deadline for bids, which had been scheduled to end
today, has been extended until Sept. 27, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said.  So-called 4G wireless networks enable faster data speeds
than older systems.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
