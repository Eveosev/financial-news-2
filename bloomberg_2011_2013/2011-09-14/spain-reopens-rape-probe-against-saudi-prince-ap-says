A Spanish court reopened a rape
investigation into Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Al Saud over
allegations he assaulted a woman on a yacht in Ibiza, the
Associated Press reported, citing court documents.  The alleged events took place in August 2008 and an
investigating magistrate had closed the case last year because
of insufficient evidence, AP said.  Kingdom Holding Company, controlled by Alwaleed, denied the
allegations in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg News, saying
he was “nowhere near Ibiza” at the time. Calls to the courts
in Ibiza and Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Balearic
Islands, weren’t answered today.  Alwaleed is a shareholder in  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  News Corp .,
AP reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
