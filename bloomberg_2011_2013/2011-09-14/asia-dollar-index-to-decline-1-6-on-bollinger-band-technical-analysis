Asia ’s main currency index may
decline as much as 1.6 percent in the coming weeks as technical
indicators suggest the dollar may rally further, according to
 Barclays Capital .  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, may drop
to near the lowest closing level in 2011, after slipping below
the 200-day moving average this week, said Dhiren Sarin, chief
technical strategist for Asia Pacific at Barclays. A widening of
the index’s Bollinger band, which traders use to judge support
and resistance levels, signaled the current slump could mimic
the 4 percent slide in May 2010, he said.  “The market already completed a topping pattern and the
flight-to-quality has justified maintaining a bullish dollar
view,” Singapore-based Sarin said in an interview today. “The
dollar seems to revel in bad news.”  The Asia Dollar Index fell 0.2 percent to 117.43 as of
12:43 p.m. in  Hong Kong  and touched 117.34, the lowest level
since April 1. The security’s 200-day moving average stood at
117.65 today.  “With the breakdown through the 200-day moving average, we
are likely going to see a bigger retracement,” said Faizal Yussof, who trades currencies based on charts at KAF Investment
Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
