Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , the
world’s second-largest carrier by market value, said it may
order Airbus SAS’s A350-1000 wide-body jet as the European
planemaker plans improvements in range and payload.  The airline is also awaiting details of enhancements to
 Boeing Co. (BA) ’s competing 777-300ER before deciding which model to
purchase, Chief Executive Officer Goh Choon Phong said yesterday
in a briefing at Airbus’s headquarters in Toulouse, France. He
declined to discuss how many planes the carrier may buy.  Airbus in June said it would delay the introduction of the
A350-1000 so it could make changes including the use of improved
Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc Trent XWB engines. Singapore Air has 20
of the smaller -900 variants on order and also signed a deal for
eight 777-300ERs in August to tap demand for long-haul travel.  Goh also said the carrier was concerned about a potential
economic slowdown and the possibility of tighter credit after
Moody’s Investors Service Inc. downgraded Credit Agricole SA and
Societe Generale SA,  France ’s second- and third-largest banks.  “The most strategic concern is how the economy is going to
go,” he said. “The recent downgrade of banks in France is a
concern: the impact, if any, on the liquidity of banks, and
whether there’s a contagious effect on the rest of the economy.”  A380 Handover  Goh was in Toulouse as Singapore Air took delivery of its
13th double-decker A380. The carrier will get another next month
and expects to have received all 19 of the planes it has ordered
by mid-2014.  The Asia airline is reducing the number of seats on later
A380s in the fleet to carry more business-class passengers. The
first 11 planes had 471 seats, while the final eight will have
409. That includes an all-business class  top floor  fitted with
86 seats. The carrier also has options for six more superjumbos.  Airbus is due to begin deliveries of the A350-900, the most
popular of the A350’s three versions, around the end of 2013.
Singapore Airlines will be the second carrier to receive an A350
after Qatar Airways Ltd., Goh said.  Changes to the A350-1000 variant include work on the
landing gear and the outer part of the wing, Airbus said. The
improved performance will allow the aircraft to service routes
such as  Shanghai  to  Boston . The planemaker has also delayed the
smallest version of the A350, the -800, to focus on developing
the -900 variant and revamping its single-aisle A320.  Dreamliner Crossover  Boeing’s plans to upgrade the 777 include the adaptation of
technology used on the new 787 Dreamliner,  Marc Birtel , a
spokesman, said by e-mail. He didn’t elaborate and said Boeing
doesn’t comment on discussions with customers.  According to a report yesterday on the Flight Global
website, conceptual studies at Boeing for the 777 upgrade show a
massive new carbon fiber wing, 99,500lb thrust engine and other
improvements including a 787-style interior.  Newer 777s could get a carbon-fiber wing measuring as much
as 234 feet (71.3 meters), 21 feet more than the current all-
metal version and 10 feet wider than Boeing’s latest 747-8,
Flight Global said. The plane might also offer 15 percent more
economy seating than on the existing aircraft.  Hedging Policy  Goh also said that Singapore Airlines, which closed up 3
percent today and has a value of S$13.4 billion ($11 billion),
is particularly concerned about the volatility of fuel prices.  “Fuel prices are 40 percent of our costs,” he said. “It’s
huge, and to a large extent it’s outside our control. Hedging is
only really delaying the impact.”  Singapore Air currently has hedging contracts to cover
about 30 percent of fuel purchases for the remainder of the year
through next March, the CEO said, a figure that’s below the
proportion generally hedged at the bigger European carriers.  The airline’s board has mandated that management generally
hedge between 30 percent and 60 percent of fuel costs, depending
on what’s driving prices, he said, adding that increases since
late last year have been spurred by geopolitical events in the
 Middle East  and  Africa , not necessarily economic fundamentals.  “In times when we feel there’s market risk, we’ll tune it
to the lower end of the band,” Goh said. “In more normal
times, we tweak it back upward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
