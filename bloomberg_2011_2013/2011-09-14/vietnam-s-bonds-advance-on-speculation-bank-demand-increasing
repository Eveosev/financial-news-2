Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained
for a second day on speculation demand from lenders increased
after the central bank pumped funds into the financial system.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam injected a net 21 trillion dong
($1 billion) into the banking system last week through open-
market operations, said Luu Hai Yen, a Hanoi-based analyst at
Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co.  “Demand for bonds from commercial lenders has been on the
rise as their liquidity improved,” Yen said.  The yield on the benchmark five-year notes fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.48 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  Bond yields will likely not increase over the next month as
banks are cutting lending rates following a request from the
central bank, Yen said.  The dong was little changed at 20,832 per dollar as of 3:01
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,628 today, according
to its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent
on either side of the rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
