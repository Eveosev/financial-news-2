Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) ’s copper miners in Peru and  Indonesia  went on strike today
after pay-increase talks broke down, union officials said.  About 1,200 workers at Freeport’s  Sociedad Minera Cerro
Verde SAA (CVERDEC1)  unit, Peru’s third-largest copper producer, walked off
their jobs at 8:30 a.m. New York time, Mining Federation General
Secretary  Luis Castillo  said today by telephone. About 8,000
non-staff workers at Freeport’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia
started a one-month strike at midnight local time, said Virgo
Solossa, head of organizational affairs at the labor union.  Workers in Peru,  Chile ,  Bolivia  and Indonesia have gone on
strike at copper, gold and zinc mines this year, seeking
improved conditions and a bigger slice of record profits. Copper
yesterday rose as much as 1.5 percent as threats of mine strikes
heightened concern a global shortfall will increase.  “Freeport’s offer was insufficient,” union General
Secretary Leoncio Amudio Amudio said yesterday by telephone from
Arequipa, 750 kilometers (466 miles) southeast of  Lima . “There
was no chance of reaching an agreement.”  Freeport fell 71 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $41.29 as of
10:00 a.m. in New York trading. Cerro Verde rose 10 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $39 in Lima yesterday.  Cerro Verde miners held a 48-hour work stoppage last week.
Freeport and Grasberg’s labor union ended 38 days of talks over
2011-2013 contract terms on Aug. 26 after failing to agree on
wages. Negotiations started after the workers walked off from
their jobs for eight days in July.  Copper Shortfall  A strike at Grasberg, located in Mimika, Papua province,
1,940 miles (3,120 kilometers) east of Jakarta, and in Peru
could widen a global production shortfall of copper estimated at
670,000 metric tons this year by  Barclays Capital  and boost
prices of the metal in London that have fallen more than 14
percent from a record $10,190 a ton on Feb. 15.  “The management expects the workers to cancel the strike
plan and return to the negotiation table because the law gives
them room to continue negotiation,” Ramdani Sirait, a Jakarta-
based spokesman at Freeport, said in a text-message. He declined
to comment on the impact of the strike on production and sales.  The Grasberg workers still expect wages to increase to
between $17.50 and $43 an hour from $1.50 to $3.50, Solossa said
today. The union cut their expectations from $35 to $200 an hour
initially, he said Aug. 26. Freeport offered a compensation
package that includes an increase in basic wages for non-staff
employees of 22 percent over a two-year period, Sirait said on
Sept. 5.  ‘No Sincerity’  “We don’t see any sincerity from the company on resolving
the pay issue and coming up with a new offer,” Solossa said by
telephone today from Timika, the closest town to the mine.
“We’ve obtained permits from the regent and chief of police for
the strike.”  Workers in  Peru  are demanding a 9 percent annual wage rise,
while Cerro Verde is offering a one-time bonus of 1,200 soles
($705), Amudio said.  Phoenix-based Freeport will continue negotiating a new
labor contract, spokesman  Eric Kinneberg  said on Sept. 8. Cerro
Verde, which is studying a $3.5 billion expansion to increase
annual copper output by 45 percent, boosted first-half output by
4 percent to 161,246 metric tons.  Grasberg, where operations started in 1990, contains the
world’s largest recoverable reserves of copper and the biggest
 gold reserves , according to Freeport’s website. Copper
production at the mine fell to 1.22 billion pounds (553.4
million kilograms) last year from 1.41 billion pounds in 2009,
according to the website. Gold output declined to 1.79 million
ounces (50,745 kilograms) from 2.57 million ounces.  Copper for three-month delivery declined 1.7 percent to
$8,617.75 a metric ton as of 4:13 p.m. local time on the  London 
Metal Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
