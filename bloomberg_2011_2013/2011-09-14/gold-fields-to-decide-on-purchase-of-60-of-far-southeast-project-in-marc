Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  will decide on an
option to buy 60 percent of the Far Southeast gold and copper
project in the Philippines by March 20 next year, Gold Fields
Philippines Corp. President Brett Mattison told reporters.  Far Southeast is a “very interesting project’ and will be
‘‘a substantial investment’’ for the company, said Mattison,
who’s attending a mining conference in Manila. Gold Fields
signed a year ago an option agreement to buy 60 percent of the
undeveloped Far Southeast project for $340 million from  Lepanto
Consolidated Mining (LC)  Co. and Liberty Express Assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
