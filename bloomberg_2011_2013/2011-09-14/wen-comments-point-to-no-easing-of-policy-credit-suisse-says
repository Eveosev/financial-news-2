Premier  Wen Jiabao ’s comments
yesterday at the World Economic Forum were a “very clear”
message that  China  will not ease its monetary stance, Credit
Suisse Group AG said.  Wen vowed to maintain a balance among keeping steady and
relatively fast growth, pursuing economic transformation and
managing price expectations, Dong Tao, analyst at Credit Suisse,
wrote in a report dated today. The comments show that China’s
monetary policy position will not ease, despite some
“optimistic anticipation” from the market, the analyst wrote.  “The Chinese economy has slowed down, but by no means in a
crisis mode,” the analyst wrote. Fiscal policy would “come to
the rescue” if economic growth showed signs of slowing below 6
percent and the job market worsens, which wouldn’t happen until
next year at the earliest, he wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
