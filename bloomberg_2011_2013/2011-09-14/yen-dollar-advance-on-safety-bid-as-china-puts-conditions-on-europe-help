The yen rose against all but one of
its 16 major peers, trading near a 10-year high versus the euro
as investors sought the safest assets after  China  put conditions
on support to Europe’s highly indebted economies.  The Japanese currency gained against the euro for a fifth
day. China’s Premier Wen Jiabao signaled developed nations
should cut deficits and create jobs rather than relying on his
country to bail out the world economy. The European Union and
the U.S. should open their markets in return for investments,
Wen said today. Finance ministers from Brazil, Russia, India,
China and  South Africa , the so-called BRICS nations, will meet
next week to discuss Europe’s debt crisis.  “If you’re looking for a safe haven, it needs to be big
and liquid,” said  Simon Derrick , chief currency strategist at
Bank of New York Mellon in  London . Investors will “say maybe we
need to continue to reduce our risk toward the euro zone and the
euro in particular. You’re talking about gains in the dollar,
you are talking about the yen.”  The yen was little changed at 105.24 per euro at 11:11 a.m.
in London. It reached 103.90 on Sept. 12, the strongest since
June 2001. Against the dollar, the yen climbed 0.1 percent to
76.85. The dollar weakened 0.1 percent to $1.3690 per euro.  “Countries must first put their own houses in order,” Wen
said at the World Economic Forum in Dalian, China. He reiterated
his June message that China can offer “a helping hand” to
 Europe  by investing there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
