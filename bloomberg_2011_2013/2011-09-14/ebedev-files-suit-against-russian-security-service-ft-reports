Alexander Lebedev , the billionaire
owner of Russia’s National Reserve Bank, initiated a legal
action against the FSB, the country’s security service, the
Financial Times reported.  The lawsuit, filed in a Moscow court yesterday, claims
damages of 350 million rubles ($11.6 million) for harm to
Lebedev’s business reputation caused by a special forces raid on
the bank in November last year, the newspaper said.  The target of the suit is Directorate K, a branch of the
security service responsible for combating economic crime, the
FT said, adding that the FSB declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
