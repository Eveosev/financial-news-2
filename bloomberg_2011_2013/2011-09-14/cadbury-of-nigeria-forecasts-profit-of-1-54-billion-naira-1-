Cadbury Nigeria Plc (CADBURY) , a manufacturer
of drinks and food products, forecast annual net income of 1.54
billion naira ($9.9 million).  Revenue for the 12-month period through December will be
33.77 billion naira, the Lagos-based company said in a statement
published on the website of the Nigerian Stock Exchange today.  Cadbury Nigeria returned to profit in 2010, with net income
of 1.17 billion naira after a loss of 1.24 billion naira a year
earlier, according to its annual report for last year.
Investment in a new plant and improved sales support
expectations profits will continue to rise, the company said.  The company didnâ€™t pay a dividend in 2010 as it sought to
build its cash reserves, Chairman Atedo Peterside said on May
12. The stock has fallen 37 percent this year, compared with a
14 percent decline in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share
Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
