Ukraine’s government sees the
hryvnia stable next year at about 8 per dollar, First Deputy
Prime Minister Andriy Klyuev said.  Ukraine will pay an average of $414 to $416 for 1,000 cubic
meters of Russian natural gas in 2012, Klyuev said, citing
statistics from the country’s proposed 2012 budget. The price
will increase in the first two quarters and then ease by the
year-end, according to the government’s calculations, Klyuev
said.  The government wants to keep prices for households
unchanged next year, Klyuev said. The country is in talks with
the  International Monetary Fund , which wants Ukraine to raise
domestic fuel prices to resume the flow of funds from its
bailout loan after it was frozen in March.  The government also plans to extend grain export duties
through the end of the marketing year that started July 1,
Klyuev said. Ukraine may supply 24 million tons of cereals in
the year.  Lawmakers will begin debating the 2012 state budget on
Sept. 22, Klyuev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
