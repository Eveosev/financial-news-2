Zimbabwe, which is compelling
foreign-owned companies to cede control of their businesses to
black citizens of the country, plans to establish a sovereign
wealth fund that will hold stakes in mining companies.  The country wants foreign companies including  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) 
and  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  to sell 51 percent stakes in
their mines. Zimbabwe has the world’s second-biggest platinum
and chrome reserves as well as deposits of gold,  iron ore , coal,
diamonds and nickel.  “The sovereign wealth fund will hold shares in various
mining businesses,” Saviour Kasukuwere, the country’s
indigenization minister, told a conference in Harare, the
capital, today. “It is a vehicle to ensure that Zimbabwe’s
natural resources benefit the whole nation rather than a select
few.”  Zimbabwe’s plans to force foreign mining companies to sell
control of their businesses has met resistance from companies
such as Johannesburg-based Impala, with the company’s Chief
Executive Officer  David Brown  saying last month that the law is
blocking investment of as much as $10 billion by the company.  Zimplats Holdings Ltd. (ZIM) , a unit of Impala, said today that a
threat to cancel its mining license in Zimbabwe has been
withdrawn after it held talks with the government following the
rejection of its initial proposal. Another proposal is to be
submitted.  Community trusts will also be established to hold shares in
mining businesses, Kasukuwere said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
