The forint weakened a fifth day
against the euro to a one-year low on speculation that a plan to
allow borrowers to repay foreign-currency mortgages below market
rates will be used more widely than previously expected.  Hungary ’s currency depreciated 1.3 percent to 286.1 per
euro as of 5 p.m. in Budapest. The forint slumped 1.4 percent
against the Swiss franc to 239.5, a fourth day of declines. The
benchmark  government bonds  maturing in June 2022 slumped,
lifting the yield 28 basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, to
7.78 percent, the highest since Aug. 10.  The government expects at least 150,000 to 300,000 people
to make use of the plan for early repayment of mortgages
denominated in Swiss francs or euros at as much as 20 percent
below prevailing rates, Prime Minister Viktor Orban told HirTV
in an interview late yesterday.  “The participation rate could actually be much higher than
it looked at first glance,”  Gyula Toth , a Vienna-based
strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , wrote in a research report today.
“Accordingly we recommend establishing bearish positions in
Hungary.”  Investors should sell forint for euros as the Hungarian
currency may weaken to 295 in the “near term” because of the
plan, Toth said.  Two-thirds of Hungarian mortgages are denominated in Swiss
francs and defaults have increased as a strengthening franc sent
monthly installments soaring. The repayment plan poses a
“significant threat” to the financial sector, the economy and
growth, the Hungarian Banking Association said on Sept. 12.  “The forint could stay under pressure” because of the
plan,  Bartosz Pawlowski , a strategist at BNP Paribas SA in
 London , said today by e-mail.  OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary’s largest lender, bought back
100,000 of its own shares yesterday at an average price of 3,646
forint each, according to a statement today on the Budapest
Stock Exchange website. The stock rose 0.3 percent to 3,650
forint, after falling 15 percent in the three previous days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
