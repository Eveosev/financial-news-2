Canada will extend the deadline for
talks aimed at harmonizing its  sales tax  with Quebec’s
provincial sales tax until the end of September, Finance
Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today.  Discussions “are going well and we are making headway,”
Flaherty said in a statement posted on the finance ministry
website. In the campaign for the May 2 election, the
Conservative government pledged to negotiate a compensation
package for Quebec to entice it to fully merge the two taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
