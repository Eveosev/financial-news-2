Home sales in Southern California
rose in August for the first time in more than a year, led by a
surge in deals for lower-priced properties,  DataQuick  said.  A total of 19,654 houses and condominiums sold last month
in  Los Angeles , Riverside,  San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino
and Orange counties, an increase of 6 percent from a year
earlier and 8.6 percent from July, the data company said today
in a statement. It was the first year-over-year sales advance
since June 2010, with all six counties showing gains.  Sales of homes priced $300,000 and below jumped 10 percent
from a year earlier, according to San Diego-based DataQuick.
That pushed the median transaction price to $279,000, down 3.1
percent from August 2010 and 1.4 percent from the previous
month. Prices have dropped on a yearly basis for six months.  “Home sales were up from a year earlier but remained far
below average,” DataQuick President  John Walsh  said in the
statement. “Many would-be buyers can’t find financing, and
others who want to make a move now are stuck because they owe
more than their homes are worth. Financial markets are
increasingly choppy, the political outlook is incredibly murky
and  consumer confidence  remains poor.”  Orange County sales gained 9.5 percent from a year earlier
for the biggest increase. Prices there were the most expensive
in the region at a median $420,000, down 4.5 percent. Los
Angeles County prices dropped 4.5 percent to a median $315,000,
and San Bernardino County, with an abundance of distressed
homes, had a 5.1 percent decline, to $150,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
