Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
said her government will respect existing oil contracts, taking
distance from allies in oil-producing states who want to raise
taxes on  Petroleo Brasileiro SA. (PETR4)   “You need to respect existing oil contracts,” Rousseff
told reporters in Brasilia today. “You don’t break contracts
because then you will have legal action that isn’t any help to
anyone.”  Her comments came ahead of a meeting today between
lawmakers and Finance Minister Guido Mantega to break a deadlock
in Congress on how to distribute revenues from future oil
concessions in the so-called pre-salt region of the Atlantic
Ocean. States that produce no oil are requesting a greater share
of revenues.  Rio de Janeiro Governor Sergio Cabral, an ally of the
government, is seeking to increase revenue from an oil tax
levied on the country’s most productive fields, most of which
are located in his state. State-controlled Petrobras is Brazil’s
biggest producer, pumping about 90 percent of the country’s oil
and natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
