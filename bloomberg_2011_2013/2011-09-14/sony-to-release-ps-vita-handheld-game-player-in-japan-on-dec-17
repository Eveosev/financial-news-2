Sony Corp. (6758)  will release its new
PlayStation Vita portable game player in  Japan  on Dec. 17,
aiming to narrow the sales gap with Nintendo Co.’s 3DS.  Sony has no plan to reduce the new handheld’s price and
will use  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , Japan’s largest mobile phone carrier,
to provide wireless service for the player’s 3G model, Hiroshi
Kawano, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Japan, said at
a press conference in Tokyo today.  The Vita faces intensified competition after Nintendo cut
the price of its 3DS 3-D portable player by as much as 40
percent last month and as more consumers use  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone
and Facebook Inc.’s online services to play games. Boosting
profit from games may help Sony offset an eighth straight year
of losses at its main television business.  Starting Oct. 15, Sony will take pre-orders for the PS Vita
in Japan, where it will sell for 24,980 yen ($325) in the Wi-Fi
version and 29,980 yen for the 3G model.  Sony rose 0.3 percent to 1,501 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
 Tokyo  trading, compared with a 1.1 percent decline in Japan’s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  The prepaid data plan will cost 980 yen for 20 hours and
4,980 yen for 103 hours, DoCoMo said. The Vita will have 26
software titles available when it goes on sale, Sony said.  Network Strategy  The Vita is part of Sony’s networked strategy to link its
TVs, Blu-ray players, game consoles and digital cameras via the
Internet to movies, music and video games. Japan’s biggest
exporter of consumer electronics is also increasing online
services, such as PlayStation Suite, which allows users to
download games on devices that run on Google Inc.’s Android.  U.S. and European consumers will be able to buy the Vita
after Christmas, Hirai said Aug. 4. The model features an
organic light-emitting diode display and a rear touchpad.  The maker of Cyber-shot cameras and Walkman music players
is forecasting a profit of 60 billion yen this fiscal year after
three consecutive years of losses. Sony cut its full-year profit
forecast 25 percent in July, citing sluggish demand for TVs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
