Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it
lowered forecasts for the euro versus the dollar as fiscal
tensions in the region increase.  The shared currency will trade at $.140 at the end of the
year, down from $.145, the New York-based firm said in note to
clients today. It also reduced its six- and 12-month outlooks to
$1.45 and $1.50, from $1.50 and $1.55 respectively. Analysts led
by  Thomas Stolper , chief foreign exchange strategist in  London ,
“continue to expect euro-dollar to rise again, albeit from a
slightly lower starting point.”  Failure of euro area governments to calm market concern
over Greek default and contagion, relatively little additional
fiscal tightening in the U.S. and weaker-than-expected global
economic data contributed to the revisions, according to the
report.  “The extent of the friction and the relative weakness of
the policy response was not our core scenario,” the analysts
wrote.  The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.3754 at 4:55 p.m. in  New
York  from $1.3678 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
