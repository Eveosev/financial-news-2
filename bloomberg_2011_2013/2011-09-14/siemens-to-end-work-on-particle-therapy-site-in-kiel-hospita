Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest maker
of medical equipment, will abort plans for an advanced cancer-
treatment center at a hospital in northern Germany after costs
for the particle therapy surged.  The company, based in Munich, will create a conventional
cancer center at the Kiel hospital using radiotherapy after
reaching a preliminary agreement with the regional government
and the hospital, Siemens said in a statement today. Costs tied
to the scaled down site were already part of the writedowns that
were booked last quarter, Siemens said.  “It is most regrettable that Kiel will not now be
acquiring a particle-therapy treatment facility,” Jost de
Jager, the Economic and Science Minister of Schleswig-Holstein,
said in the statement. The particle-therapy part of the site is
half built, and the equipment will likely be dismantled, Siemens
said.  Siemens has already scaled back plans for a particle-
therapy center in Marburg, north of  Frankfurt , after taking
charges for the technology. The company has built one particle-
therapy facility in Heidelberg that is operational, and work is
continuing on a similar site in Shanghai.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
