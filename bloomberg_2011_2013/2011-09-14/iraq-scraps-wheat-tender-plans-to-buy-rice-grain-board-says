Iraq  has cancelled a tender for
50,000 metric tons of wheat and is inviting bids to buy 30,000
tons of rice from  South America , said Amer Abdel Aziz, spokesman
for the countryâ€™s Grain Board.  Abdel Aziz did not give a reason for the cancellation of
the wheat tender, when he spoke to Bloomberg by phone today.
Bids were due by Sept. 6, according to a notice by the Trade
Ministry last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
