OAO EuroChem, Russia’s largest
producer of nitrogen fertilizers, may buy  BASF SE (BAS) ’s fertilizer
plant in Antwerp,  Belgium , Interfax reported, citing a person it
didn’t identify.  BASF, based in Ludwigshafen, Germany, offered the bulk of
its fertilizer assets for sale in February as it shifts to less
cyclical products. The chemicals company is poised to sell most
of its nitrogen fertilizer assets to  Yara International ASA (YAR) , two
people with knowledge of the plan said last week.  EuroChem’s billionaire Chairman Andrey Melnichenko said
today that the Russian company may close a deal to buy a
“large” fertilizer unit in Europe by the end of September,
according to Interfax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
