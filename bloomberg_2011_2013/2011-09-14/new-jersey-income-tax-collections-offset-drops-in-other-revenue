New Jersey revenue collections for
the first two months of the fiscal year that began July 1 were
less than 1 percent higher than budget forecasts, Treasurer
Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said in a statement today.  Collections from six of the largest sources of state
revenue missed projections, including the casino tax, which was
17.5 percent below estimates. Income-tax collections were 8.9
percent over budget, making up for the other revenue declines,
according to the treasury department.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
