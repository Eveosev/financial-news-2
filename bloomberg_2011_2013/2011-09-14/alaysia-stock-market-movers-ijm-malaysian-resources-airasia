Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Malaysia  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 5 p.m. close in  Kuala
Lumpur .  Malaysia’s  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBMKLCI)  Index fell 10.39
points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,437.61, its lowest close since
Sept. 8, 2010.        Ramunia Holdings Bhd. (RH)  , an oil and gas services
provider, slid 4.6 percent to 42 sen, its steepest decline since
Aug. 16. Net profit in the third quarter ended July 31 dropped
87 percent to 2.04 million ringgit, the company reported.  Supermax Corp. (SUCB MK), a rubber-glove maker fell for a
seventh day, dropping 10 percent to 2.32 ringgit, the biggest
loss since September 2001. Executive Chairman Stanley Thai said
the share slump may be due to foreign funds “taking profit.”  “We have a high percentage of institutional
shareholdings,” he said in an interview today. “When they exit
or take profit, our counter gets hit. This is a good time where
there is a good bargain for people who understand our
industry.”        Tenaga Nasional Bhd. (TNB)  , Malaysia’s biggest power
producer, fell 1.7 percent to 5.12 ringgit, its lowest close
since Sept. 7. The stock’s “fair value” was cut to 6.24
ringgit from 7.53 ringgit at OSK Holdings Bhd., which said
Tenaga may continue to record losses on higher fuel costs and
slower demand growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
