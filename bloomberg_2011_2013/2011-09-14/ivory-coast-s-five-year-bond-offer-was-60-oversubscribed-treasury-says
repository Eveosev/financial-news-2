Ivory Coast  received 60 percent
more subscriptions for five-year bonds than it offered,
accepting all of the bids as the West African nation aims to
restore its conflict-damaged economy.  Investors sought 160.3 billion  CFA francs  ($334 million),
more than the 100 billion francs offered in the sale that
started Aug. 29 and ended on Sept. 12, Adama Kone, director
general of the country’s Treasury, told reporters today in
Abidjan, the commercial capital.  Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa producer, is
emerging from a violent political crisis that lasted nearly five
months and was sparked by a disputed election in November. The
country’s economy is expected to contract 5.8 percent this year
before growth of 8.5 percent in 2012, according to the  Finance
Ministry .  The high demand in the bond offer shows “the confidence of
the financial community in Ivory Coast and in its recovery and
reconstruction policy,” Kone said. “It’s a sign of a progressive
return to normality.”  Most of the investors are West African banks, with each
country in the sub-region taking part in the offer, he said.
Part of the funds, 61.2 billion francs, will be used to pay
another debt that matures tomorrow, Kone said. The remainder
will be used for the country’s budget, he said.  Damage to the economy caused by the impasse forced  Ivory
Coast  to ask for a reassessment of $2.3 billion of Eurobonds
after it missed two coupon payments on the debt in January and
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
