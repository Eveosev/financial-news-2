EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal service is
adding features that give businesses more flexibility over how
they sell wares and accept payments.  The changes, due in the coming months, include mobile
payments, barcode scanning via handheld device, store inventory
lookup and offers based on a person’s location, PayPal said
today in a  blog  posting.  Improvements at PayPal are part of an effort by EBay Chief
Executive Officer John Donahoe to accelerate growth and step up
competition with  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  in the e-commerce market.
PayPal’s sales grew 31 percent last quarter, outpacing gains at
the main commerce business for  San Jose , California-based EBay.  “We gave merchants a sneak peek at PayPal’s new payment
technologies that will help give their customers a much better
shopping and buying experience through PayPal,”  Scott Thompson ,
president of PayPal, wrote on the blog.  New services will let customers pay for a product with as
little as a name and telephone number, Sam Shrauger,  vice
president  of global product and experience at PayPal, said in an
interview.  The new technologies will help boost PayPal’s volume of
transactions in 2012 beyond the $100 billion it’s due to report
this year, he said. The company had about $92 billion in payment
volume in 2010.  EBay rose 74 cents to $30.14 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It has gained 8.3 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
