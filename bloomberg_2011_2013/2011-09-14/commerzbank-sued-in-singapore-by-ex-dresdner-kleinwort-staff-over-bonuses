Commerzbank AG,  Germany ’s second-
largest lender, was sued by 10 former employees at its Dresdner
Kleinwort unit in  Singapore  claiming they were entitled to S$9.5
million ($7.7 million) in bonuses.  The former workers at the investment bank claimed they were
given false assurances and induced to stay on because of the
proposed bonus to be paid in January 2009, according to a
lawsuit filed with the Singapore High Court in July.  “ Dresdner Bank  was entitled to reduce its employees’ 2008
discretionary bonuses in the light of the marked deterioration
in the investment bank’s performance in late 2008,” Commerzbank
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The German lender will
“vigorously” defend against the claims, it added.  Commerzbank has also been sued by former Dresdner bankers
in London and  Frankfurt  over prospective 2008 bonuses.
Commerzbank, which sought 18.2 billion euros ($25 billion) from
the German state after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed
in 2008, acquired Dresdner Bank AG in January 2009.  Dresdner’s investment-banking operations posted a 6.3
billion-euro loss for 2008.  Kenneth Tan, a lawyer for the former employees, declined to
comment on the Singapore lawsuit.  The former employees based in Singapore were informed in
December 2008 of their target bonus, which ranged from S$233,099
to S$3.7 million, according to the court filing.  Cut by E-Mail  In February 2009, Commerzbank Chief Executive Officer
Martin Blessing sent employees an e-mail announcing the cut in
bonus for 2008, according to the court papers.  “The board promised something and the board has somehow
failed to deliver this,” Blessing wrote in the internal e-mail
according to the lawsuit. “We, my colleagues and I, also have
to fight to rebuild the trust that we have shattered with this
decision.”  Commerzbank is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit, calling the
claims “scandalous” and “vexatious,” according to its
defense filed last month.  The case is Daniel John Brader & Ors v  Commerzbank AG (CBK) 
S486/2011 in the Singapore High Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
