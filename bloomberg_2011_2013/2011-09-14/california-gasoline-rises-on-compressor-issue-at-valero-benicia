California-blend gasoline
strengthened for the first time this week after  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO)  reported a compressor issue at its Benicia refinery.  The premium for Carbob in  San Francisco  widened 3.25 cents
to 13.25 cents a gallon above gasoline futures traded on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:05 p.m. East Coast time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 0.66 cent to
$2.849 a gallon.  Valero reported flaring at its 170,000-barrel-a-day Benicia
refinery, northeast of San Francisco, yesterday after the
compressor issue. “There was no material impact to
production,” said Bill Day, a spokesman for Valero based in San
Antonio.  The refinery told local air regulators yesterday that it
was trying to determine which compressor caused the flaring,
Matthew Geisert, a hazardous materials supervisor for Solano
County, said in a telephone interview.  The premium for Carbob in  Los Angeles  rose 1.75 cents to
14.75 cents over futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland , Oregon,
strengthened 4 cents to 27 cents a gallon over futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
