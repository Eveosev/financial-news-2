Anis Chakravarty, an economist at
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu  India  Pvt., comments on India’s
inflation rate. The wholesale-price index rose 9.78 percent in
August from a year earlier after a 9.22 percent jump in July,
the government said today. The median of 25 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 9.64 percent increase.  Chakravarty spoke in a phone interview.  “We are seeing inflation at over 9 percent this year and
the interest rate increases have not managed to dent that. So,
this is the time the central bank may consider pausing and see
if there are structural changes that need to be made to address
the issue.  ‘‘There is a concern from the government and industry that
industrial growth is being hampered because of the rate hikes.
It is now time for the policy makers to discuss if there are any
other measures by which the inflation issue can be tackled.  ‘‘There are different ways in which inflation can be
tackled. Some developed countries have been able to bring down
inflation to manageable levels using long-term methods, which do
not focus only on rates.  ‘‘I believe the central bank will pause on rates on Sept.
16.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
