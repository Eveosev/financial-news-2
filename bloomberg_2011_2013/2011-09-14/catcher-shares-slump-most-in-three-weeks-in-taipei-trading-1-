Catcher Technology Co., which makes
metal casings for computers and mobile phones, slumped the most
since Aug. 25 in Taipei trading after UBS AG said there’s
speculation  HTC Corp. (2498)  may reduce demand for the company’s
products.  The stock slid 6.8 percent to NT$213 as of 12:31 p.m. local
time, set for the biggest loss since Aug. 25.  “Catcher has a very balanced customer base and won’t be
impacted by an individual customer,” James Wu, Catcher
spokesman, said by phone from Taipei. “We saw record sales in
August and the trend of using metal casings in the industry will
continue.”  Catcher’s August sales surged to NT$1.9 billion ($64.1
million) from NT$141 million from a year earlier, the company
said in a statement to the  Taiwan Stock Exchange  on Sept. 5. HTC
Chief Financial Officer Winston Yung didn’t answer calls to his
mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
