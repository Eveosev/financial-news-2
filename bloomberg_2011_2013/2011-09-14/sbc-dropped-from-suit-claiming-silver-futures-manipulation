HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA)  is no longer a
defendant in a lawsuit by investors who claimed the bank and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  manipulated silver futures and options
prices in violation of U.S. antitrust law.  The investors said in consolidated class action complaint
filed yesterday that they had signed a tolling agreement with
HSBC and weren’t naming the bank as a defendant. Tolling
agreements are often used to stop statutes of limitation from
running while the parties discuss settlement or dismissal of a
claim.  The investors claim that, starting in March 2008, the banks
colluded to suppress silver futures so that call options, or the
right to buy, would decline, and put options for the right to
sell would increase, according to the complaint filed in federal
court in  Manhattan .  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission began probing
allegations of price manipulation in the silver futures market
in September 2008.  Investors seek to represent a class of thousands of people
and companies that held or traded silver futures and options on
June 26, 2007, or from March 17, 2008, to Oct. 27, 2010.  A call to London-based HSBC seeking comment on the matter
after regular business hours yesterday wasn’t immediately
returned.  Joseph Evangelisti , a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan Chase, declined to comment.  The case is31 In re Commodity Exchange Inc. Silver Futures
and Options Trading Litigation, 11-cv-2213, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
