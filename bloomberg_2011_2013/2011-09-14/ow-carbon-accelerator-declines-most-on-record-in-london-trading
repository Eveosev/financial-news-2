Low Carbon Accelerator Ltd. (LCA) , a fund
investing in renewable energy, fell the most on record in London
trading on plans to write down a holding in Proven Energy Ltd.
after the wind-turbine maker found defects in some machines.  The fund collapsed 43 percent to 14.5 pence, the biggest
drop since the company’s shares were listed in October 2006.
 Scotland ’s Proven Energy halted sales of its Proven 35-2 turbine
after finding an “acute technical defect” in three machines,
Guernsey-based Low Carbon Accelerator said today in a statement.  Proven Energy declined to comment when contacted by phone.  Low Carbon Accelerator invested about 11.2 million pounds
($17.7 million) in Proven’s debt and equity. The producer makes
small  wind turbines  for homes and farms, describing the 35-2
model as its “flagship” machine on the company’s  website .  “Proven is now incurring losses that it cannot sustain
without a further injection of cash,” Low Carbon said in the
statement. “The board of LCA anticipates having to make a
substantial or total write down of its investment in Proven.”  The P-7 and P-11 turbines made by Proven, which supplied 6-
kilowatt machines to power a research station in  Antarctica  in
2009, are operating without interruption, Low Carbon said.  Low Carbon, which raised 44.5 million pounds in an offering
on London’s Alternative Investment Market in 2006, expects its
adjusted net asset value per share to be in a range of 30.5
pence to 31.5 pence after the write down, it said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
