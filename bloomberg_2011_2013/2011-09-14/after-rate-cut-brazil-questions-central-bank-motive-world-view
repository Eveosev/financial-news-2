Alexandre Tombini makes an unlikely media star. The portly, bespectacled, 47-year-old head of  Brazil 's  central bank  speaks quietly, and chooses his words with care. So when the bank decided to  cut its benchmark interest rate  by half a percentage point on Aug. 31 -- to 12 percent, after raising it to 12.5 percent the previous month -- it threw analysts and the market off guard, and left many Brazilians questioning the bank's motives. Tombini has been getting grilled by the Brazilian media ever since. Even two weeks after the cut, a television interview with Tombini makes prime-time news. This is how worried Brazilians are about the inflation rate, which is officially at 7.23 percent but feels much higher in major cities like Sao Paulo, where food prices are rising quickly. Brazilians remember the bad old days of economic chaos as the economy lurched from one disaster to the next -- in 1989, accumulated inflation hit a staggering 1,782 percent. To introduce its  interview with Tombini  on Sept. 8, the "Jornal da Globo" television news program first broke the bank's decision down into three bullet points: -- "Serious and long world crisis" -- "Strong fiscal adjustments" -- "Disregarded signs of inflation" The first two, Tombini explained, were the most important, and suggested slower inflation -- which is the bank's main target. Because global growth is sluggish, and because Brazil has made some strong budgetary reforms, he argued that a reduced rate was justified. But both the market and the Brazilian media saw the hand of the federal government in the rate cut. Though the central bank is officially independent, it's no secret that Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff  wants to see slower inflation. Tombini did his best to bat this away on "Jornal da Globo." He said: Enter Dilma -- as the president is universally known -- with  an interview  shown Sept. 11 on Brazil's biggest television show, "Fantastico." To warm up, the president escorted presenter Patricia Poeta around her official residence, the Palacio da Alvorada, and talked food, soap operas and grandchildren. ("Fantastico" mixes everything from home-video bloopers to dramatic human stories to celebrity interviews.) But after the fluffier questions, the interview moved to government corruption -- and the rate cut. "Was there interference from the president in the central bank's decision to reduce the basic  interest rate  by 0.5 percent?" Poeta asked. Using the formal "A Senhora" form of address, Poeta continued: "You didn't interfere, not even lightly, in this case?" Dilma responded: On Sept. 12 Tombini was back in action, this time in a  full-page interview  in Valor, Brazil's leading business daily. "Central Bank wanted to avoid 'overdose' in de-acceleration," read the paper's headline. "Tombini justifies unexpected cut with worsened situation abroad and denies political pressure," it added. In the interview Tombini defended the bank once more: But despite this coordinated media campaign, the market remains unconvinced, as  columnist Erica Fraga noted  in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper Sept. 13: Miriam Leitao, a columnist for the O Globo newspaper, also questioned the bank’s conclusions  in a blog post : She added: “The scenario the Central Bank sees is more pessimistic than that predicted by other market analysts.” The bigger picture informing this debate is the world economic slowdown and its potential impact on Brazil. The government is still proud of the way it rode out the financial storms of 2008. And it's determined to pull off the same trick again. (Dom Phillips is the  Sao Paulo  correspondent for World View.
