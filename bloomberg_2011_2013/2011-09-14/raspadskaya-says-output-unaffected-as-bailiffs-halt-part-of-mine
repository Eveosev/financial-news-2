OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP) â€™s output is
unaffected after bailiffs closed some non-producing areas of its
Raspadskaya mine where construction work is being carried out,
the Russian coal mining company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  RIA Novosti reported yesterday that court bailiffs shut
some parts of the Raspadskaya mine for two months over
violations of transportation safety rules, RIA Novosti said,
citing the local bailiffs service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
