Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd.,  Kenya ’s
only publicly traded retailer, said it expects revenue to rise
34 percent in the current financial year as it expands in  East
Africa .  Sales in the year through June 2012 may increase to 16.1
billion shillings ($170 million) from 12 billion shillings a
year earlier, Managing Director Jonathan Ciano told reporters
today in the capital, Nairobi.  Uchumi , which opened its first store in  Dar es Salaam ,
Tanzania’s commercial capital, last month and a second one in
Uganda, plans to open another seven outlets in the region, three
in Uganda and four in Kenya, he said.  Uchumi’s shares fell 1.2 percent to 8.30 shillings at 12:30
p.m. local time today. They have dropped 42 percent, almost
triple the decline on the All Share Index, since resuming
trading on May 31 following a five-year suspension after the
company went into receivership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
