Tropical Storm Maria strengthened
today on a course that’s forecast to take it west of  Bermuda 
early tomorrow, the National Hurricane Center said.  Maria’s top winds early today strengthened to 60 miles (95
kilometers) per hour from 50 mph yesterday, the center said on
its website. The system, traveling north-northwest at 10 mph,
was 615 miles south-southwest of Bermuda before 8 a.m. Miami
time and is forecast to strengthen further the next two days.  The Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm warning
and said winds of at least 39 mph may lash the island group late
today. At its closest, the storm is expected to pass about 160
miles west of Bermuda tomorrow, the agency said on its  website .
Tropical storm-force winds extend up to 175 miles from Maria’s
eye, mainly to the east, the U.S. center said.  Forecasters in  Canada  are also monitoring Maria, which the
 Canadian Hurricane Center  said may pack 68 mph winds -- below
the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane -- tomorrow and strike
Newfoundland on Sept. 16. Canadian offshore energy facilities
operated by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and
Hibernia Management & Development Co. are close to the storm’s
projected path.  To contact the reporters on this story:
