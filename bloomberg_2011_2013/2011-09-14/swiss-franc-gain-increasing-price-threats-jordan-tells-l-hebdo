Swiss central bank Vice Chairman
Thomas Jordan said the franc’s ascent is increasing risks to
 price stability , according to an interview with L’Hebdo.  “At the moment, we don’t have any signs of an inflation
risk,” Jordan told the  magazine  in an e-mailed pre-release of
tomorrow’s edition. The interview was conducted on Aug. 19
before policy makers imposed a franc ceiling of 1.20 against the
euro, according to the Zurich-based  Swiss National Bank . “At
the contrary, the current economic situation increases the
negative pressure on prices,” he said.  Jordan also said that “in theory, there’s no limit to
increasing our balance sheet,” when asked about the SNB’s
ability to print francs, the magazine reported. The central bank
is able to withdraw market liquidity “if needed,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
