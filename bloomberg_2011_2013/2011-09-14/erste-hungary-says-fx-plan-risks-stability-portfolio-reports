Hungary ’s plan to let foreign-
currency mortgage holders repay loans in a lump sum at below
market levels may “threaten the stability of the financial
system,” news portal  Portfolio  reported, citing the chief
executive officer of Erste Bank Hungary.  “The proposal may pose a significant threat to the
stability of the financial intermediary system and may have very
serious macroeconomic consequences, and I hope that everyone is
aware of this,” Radovan Jelasity said in an interview published
by the portal today. “The market and the  exchange rate  have
already expressed what they think about the announcement.”  Hungary wants to allow fixing the Swiss franc at more than
20 percent below market rates for early repayment, Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said on Sept. 12. Austrian Finance
Minister Maria Fekter said her country “firmly rejects” the
measure, which may cause “enormous losses” to banks and risks
regional financial stability.  Austrian lenders  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and  Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI)  are among Hungary’s largest banks. Erste’s
Hungarian unit is planning further cost cuts, which may include
the closure of more branches, Jelasity said.  The executive, who sees “significant” risk costs in
corporate loans and the leasing segment besides household
mortgages, hopes to turn the bank profitable in the next one or
two years. The way the bank has operated so far can’t continue.
If it were to continue the same way, the majority owner would
reconsider financing it, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
