snapped five days of gains, slumping 25 cents, or 1.9 percent,

The Nairobi-based company said it may have been overcharged by
as much as 2 billion shillings ($21 million) over the past five
years by a freight-forwarding company.  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  , sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest airline, gained 50 cents, or 1.6 percent, to 31
shillings, the highest close since Sept. 8, as it plans to
increase its share capital to fund its expansion and will
present the offer to shareholders Oct. 14.  “The story of growth is interesting to investors because a
capacity constraint has been one of the reasons the airline has
not been able to expand very fast,” Gregory Waweru, an analyst
at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a
phone interview today.  Lafarge Cement WAPCO Nigeria Plc (WAPCO)  , the country’s

plans to sell 50 billion naira of three-year notes this month,
according to Securities Africa.  Sonatel (SNTS)  SA, the largest telecommunications
company in Senegal, fell 500  CFA francs , or 0.4 percent, to
124,500 CFA francs, after it was downgraded to “hold” from
“buy” at  Renaissance Capital , which cited “lower growth and
profitability in Senegal and Mali” for its decision.
Renaissance lowered the Dakar-based company’s share price
estimate to 145,000 CFA francs a share from 187,000 francs  To contact the reporter on this story:
