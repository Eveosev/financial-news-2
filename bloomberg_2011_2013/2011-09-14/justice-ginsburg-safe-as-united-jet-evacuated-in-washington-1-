A  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
jet carrying U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was
evacuated at Washington’s Dulles International Airport after a
report of smoke from an engine.  The 185 passengers and crew used emergency slides to exit
the  Boeing Co. (BA)  757 plane around 1 p.m. local time today, Mike Trevino, a United spokesman, said by telephone. Flight 586 had
left the gate for a flight to San Francisco when the captain
ordered the evacuation, citing engine smoke, Trevino said.  Ginsburg, 78, “is fine,” Kathy Arberg, a spokeswoman for
the court, said in an e-mail message. One person was injured
during the evacuation, Trevino said.  Some passengers from the flight  posted comments and photos
on Twitter  about the incident. Chicago-based United rebooked
travelers on flights later today, Trevino said.  The Boeing 757 is a single-aisle, twin-engine jet often
used on transcontinental routes such as Washington- San
Francisco .  To contact the reporter on this story:
