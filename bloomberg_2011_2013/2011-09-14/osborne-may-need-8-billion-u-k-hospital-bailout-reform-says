U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  may need to find 5 billion pounds ($8 billion) to
bail out failing English hospitals by 2013 unless they are
overhauled “radically,” the research group  Reform  said.  As many as 40 hospitals may have to revamp the way they
operate or close by the end of the current parliamentary term in
2015, Reform said in a report published in  London  today. While
Prime Minister David Cameron’s government has exempted health
from spending cuts applied to other departments, the  National
Health Service  still has to make efficiency savings of 20
billion pounds.  “Cutting costs in hospital services means that services
need to be transformed, with fewer beds, smaller wards and in
some instances complete conversions of the way in which
hospitals work,” the report’s authors, Paul Corrigan and
Caroline Mitchell, wrote. “Some hospitals have been facing
difficulties for years, often associated with the delivery of
poor quality care, and a growing number will become financially
unviable.”  Hospitals should focus on diagnosing patients or organize
treatment more efficiently and safely in a “factory” mode of
production, Corrigan and Mitchell said. Corrigan was senior
health adviser to Prime Minister  Tony Blair , while Mitchell is
chief executive officer of  Ledge Health , a Reigate, Surrey-based
consulting firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
