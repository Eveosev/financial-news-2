California  wrapped up the sale of
$5.4 billion of revenue-anticipation notes a day earlier than
planned, according to  Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for Treasurer
Bill Lockyer.  Individual investors ordered 66 percent of the notes, or
$3.55 billion, Dresslar said today in an e-mailed statement. A
tranche maturing May 24, 2012, was priced at 0.38 percent, while
the bulk of the bonds, maturing June 26, were offered at 0.40
percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
