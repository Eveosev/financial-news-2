Kazakh billionaire Alexander Machkevitch, one of three founders of Eurasian Natural Resources
Corp., denied speculation that he may sell the London-listed
metals producer, Express K newspaper reported.  Machkevitch, who owns 14.59 percent of the company, said
the information that he may sell his stake in ENRC or that he
has disagreements with the two other founders, Alijan Ibragimov
and Patokh Chodiev, is “groundless,’ according to an interview
published today on the Astana-based newspaper’s  website .  ENRC’s board of directors approved projects valued at $6
billion to $7 billion to be implemented in the next three years,
Machkevitch was cited as saying by Express K.  Separately, Machkevitch said he doesn’t see reasons for
selling AO Eurasian Bank, owned by ENRC founders, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
