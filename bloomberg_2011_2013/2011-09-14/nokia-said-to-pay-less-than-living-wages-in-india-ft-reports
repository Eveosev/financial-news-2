Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the Finnish mobile phone
maker, was accused by Finnwatch, a human rights group, of paying
some workers in India less than a living wage, the Financial
Times reported.  Finnwatch said the company pays contract workers at its
factory in Chennai,  Tamil Nadu , about 70 euros ($95) a month,
which is above the legal minimum wage but compares with the 127
euros a month that the Asia Floor Wage campaign judges to be the
minimum living wage, the newspaper said.  The factory, Nokia’s biggest, employs more than 11,300
people, 45 percent of them on time-limited or trainee contracts,
the FT said.  A Nokia spokesman said Asia Floor Wage’s minimum living
wage estimate uses the New Delhi area as a benchmark,
inappropriate for  Chennai , and benefits such as occupational
health care, meals, day care and transport haven’t been taken
into account, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
