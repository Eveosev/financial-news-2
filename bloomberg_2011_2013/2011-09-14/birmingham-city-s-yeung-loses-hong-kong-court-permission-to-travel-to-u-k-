Hong Kong’s High Court overruled a
lower court decision allowing  Birmingham International Holdings
Ltd. (2309)  Chairman Carson Yeung to leave Hong Kong while on bail,
according to Yeung’s lawyer Clive Grossman.  “The reason given was that there is a risk he may not come
back,” said Grossman about the ruling by Judge Peter John Line
in Hong Kong’s Court of First Instance today.  Yeung was allowed last month by a lower court judge to
travel to London from Sept. 15 to Sept 19 to meet with players
and management of British soccer club Birmingham City. Yeung is
charged with five counts of money laundering involving HK$721.3
million ($92 million).  Hong Kong’s Department of Justice asked the High Court to
review the lower court’s order at a closed-door hearing today.  Department spokeswoman Sherlin Fu confirmed the result of
the hearing. She declined to further comment on the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
