Two suspects in the twin bombings
in  Uganda ’s capital, Kampala, last year in which 76 people were
killed pleaded guilty on the second day of their trial, the
 Daily Monitor  reported.  Edris Nsubuga, who is being charged along with two brothers
and 11 others, pleaded guilty to charges of terrorism, murder
and attempted murder, while another suspect, Muhamoud Mugisha,
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit terrorism, the Kampala-
based newspaper said, citing court proceedings.  The state dropped charges against five people, including
Kenyan human rights activist Al-Amin Kimanthi, on the first day
of the trial on Sept. 12, it said.  The Somalia-based al-Shaabab group, which has pledged
allegiance to al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attacks
that targeted people watching the televised final match of
soccer’s  World Cup  on July 11, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
