Poland ’s  Finance Ministry  playing
down the impact of economic slowdown in the euro area on its
fiscal situation shows it’s in a “denial phase,” Citigroup
Inc. said in a report today.  The general government deficit may reach between 4 percent
and 4.5 percent next year, wider than 3 percent forecast by the
Finance Ministry, Citigroup economists Piotr Kalisz and Cezary
Chrapek wrote in a report following meetings in Warsaw. The
government will cut spending following the general election on
Oct. 9, they wrote.  Poland is unlikely to repeat its “stellar outperformance”
from 2009 because it lacks leeway to loosen fiscal policy,
according to Citigroup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
