3i Group Plc (III) , Britain’s biggest
publicly traded private-equity firm, has set terms for 205
million euros ($280 million) of loans to be used to finance its
buyout of French building-product maker Etanco, according to a
person with knowledge of the situation.  The financing includes an 85 million-euro, seven-year  term
loan  paying an initial interest margin of 500 basis points more
than the euro interbank offered rate, said the person, who
didn’t want to be identified because the deal is private. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Bank of Ireland has joined Credit Agricole CIB, Credit
Mutuel CIC and Societe Generale SA to arrange the senior
loans, the person said. Potential lenders are invited to a
bank meeting in Paris on Sept. 19, said the person.  London-based 3i will fund more than 50 percent of the cost
of the  buyout  with its own funds as equity while the
acquisition debt represents 4.2 times Etanco’s earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, said the person.
IK Investment Partners Ltd. agreed to sell Etanco to 3i in a
deal valuing the French company at 370 million euros, two people
familiar with the situation said on Sept. 5.  Kathryn van der Kroft, a spokeswoman for 3i, wasn’t
immediately available to comment.  Details of financing are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
