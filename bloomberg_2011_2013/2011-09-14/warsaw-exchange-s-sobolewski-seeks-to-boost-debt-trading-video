Ludwik Sobolewski, chief executive 
officer of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, talks about prospects for 
additional growth of the exchange this year, the outlook for the
listing of additional foreign companies and proposed changes to 
Polish law as part of an effort to boost the bourse's corporate 
debt-trading platform.  A proposal to let banks trade bonds without using a broker 
was sent to the Finance Ministry in July. Sobolewski spoke with 
Bloomberg's Pawel Kozlowski in Warsaw on Sept. 13. (Source:
