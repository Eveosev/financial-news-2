North Sea Flotta crude exports will
decline to two cargoes in October, compared with three this
month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Shipments will consist of one consignment of 1 million
barrels and another of 600,000 barrels, totaling 1.6 million
barrels, or 51,613 barrels a day, according to the program. That
compares with 1.85 million barrels, or 61,667 barrels a day,
this month.  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  operates the field.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
