R. Gopalan, secretary of the
Department of Economic Affairs in  India ’s finance ministry,
comments on the  Reserve Bank  of India’s policy on the rupee.  The currency has slumped more than 8 percent after touching
a three-year high on July 27, making it the worst performer in
 Asia  during the period. It weakened past 48 per dollar today for
the first time since September 2009 and traded at 47.77 as of
12:56 p.m. in Mumbai.  “As far as the Indian economy is concerned, I have a
feeling that the RBI is following a good policy of not
interfering, but the point is that once it goes beyond a point,
we need to look at how we can manage.  ‘‘It still remains in the RBI’s domain, their sphere and
they know what right action to take. It could be a short-term
disruption and I don’t think that we need to give up our policy
for short-term disruptions.”  On the effect on commodity prices:  “The depreciation of the rupee will increase the prices of
imported commodities and may be one of the factors in fanning
inflation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
