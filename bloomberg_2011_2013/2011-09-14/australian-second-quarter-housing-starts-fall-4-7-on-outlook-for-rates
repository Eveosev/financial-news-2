Australian housing starts dropped
in the second quarter, defying economists’ expectations for an
increase, as more home buyers and builders remained on the
sidelines.  Dwelling starts dropped 4.7 percent in the three months to
June 30 from the first quarter, a government report showed today
in Sydney. The forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of five
economists was for a 2 percent gain.  “Building approvals and starts numbers are weakening
because we had a very strong 2009, and all the buyers and
builders got in then,” Ben Jarman, an economist at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in Sydney, said in a telephone interview. While
housing data may improve on the view that the central bank will
hold  interest rates  steady, “our expectation is rates will rise
further, so any lift in housing market numbers will prove short-
lived,” he said.  Australian  home prices  have dropped to the lowest level
since 2009 after the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  boosted borrowing
costs seven times from October 2009 to November 2010.  Home-loan approvals in July rose less than economists
forecast and the number of properties listed for sale in August
jumped 23.6 percent from a year ago, as rising unemployment and
subdued investment outside of the mining industry kept a lid on
demand for homes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
