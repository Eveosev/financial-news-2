The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:55 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.2 percent to 13,517.28, while the
Colcap Index rose 0.1 percent to 1,636.06.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based oil
company with fields in the South American country, was unchaged
at 1,590 pesos after falling as much as 1.3 percent to 1,570
pesos, the lowest intraday since the stock began trading in July
2010.  The company may be hitting new lows because the market is
waiting for news about its exploration projects in the Caguan-
Putumayo basin, said Juan David Pineros, oil sector analyst for
Interbolsa SA,  Colombia â€™s biggest brokerage.  The company plans to release new information about
exploration in that basin the first week in October, Carolina
Orozco, head of  investor relations  for the company in Colombia,
said by phone from Bogota.  Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC CB), a Calgary-based  oil company 
with production and exploration in Colombia, rose 1.8 percent to
54,600 pesos. The company said it resumed production at its
Corcel and Guatiquia fields in the South American country.  Petrominerlaes said Sept. 12 that production totaling over
30,000 barrels of oil per day had been shut-in on blockades by
protesters. The company said today in a Marketwire statement
that it expects full capacity to be restored within 48 to 72
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
