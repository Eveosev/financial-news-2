Estonia’s central bank should be
entrusted with managing the Baltic country’s government-sector
reserves, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip  said.  The Finance Ministry said this month that it plans to
consolidate the management of all state institutions under the
Treasury from 2012, eliminating the government’s need to borrow
elsewhere until 2015. Ansip suggested today all government-
sector reserves could be managed by the central bank, Ansip’s
spokeswoman Liina Kersna said by phone from Tallinn today.  The central bank’s reserves “have declined significantly
since Estonia joined the euro,” Ansip said in parliament
earlier today when asked by lawmakers to explain plans to
consolidate reserve management under the Treasury. It would be
“sensible” to manage the state’s assets centrally,” he said.  Liquid government assets, including health and unemployment
insurance funds not managed by the Treasury, were 1.73 billion
euros ($2.36 billion) at the end of 2010, equivalent to 12
percent of gross domestic product, according to the  Finance
Ministry ’s website.  “It’s certainly possible for the central bank to provide a
service to the government by managing state reserves in case
there is such a request,” central bank spokesman Viljar Raask
said in an e-mailed comment today. “Eesti Pank supports the
Prime Minister’s view that Estonia’s state reserves should be
managed effectively.”  Consolidating reserves under the Treasury would cut the
planned state debt to 5.3 percent of GDP by 2015 from an April
forecast of 11.8 percent, the ministry said Sept. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
