China ’s bonds dropped after the
government sold one-year debt at a higher yield than forecast.  The Ministry of Finance sold 32.51 billion yuan ($5.1
billion) of notes at 3.90 percent, according to Chinabond, the
nation’s biggest debt-clearing house. That compared with the
3.86 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of eight
fixed-income analysts and traders yesterday. Demand for bonds
will wane as the availability of cash diminishes toward the end
of the month, according to Guo Caomin, an analyst at Industrial
Bank Co.  “The market expects cash supply will drop a lot at the end
of the month as banks hoard cash to meet quarter-end capital or
loan-to-deposit requirements,” Shanghai-based Guo said.  The yield on the 3.48 percent government bonds due July
2012 rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.89
percent as of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to the
National Interbank Funding Center.  The highest winning-bid yield at the debt sale was 3.95
percent, and the auction drew bids that were 2.1 times the
amount on offer, according to the statement.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, climbed one basis point to 3.30 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the Interbank
Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined four
basis points to 4.05 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Ven Ram, Anil Varma  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
