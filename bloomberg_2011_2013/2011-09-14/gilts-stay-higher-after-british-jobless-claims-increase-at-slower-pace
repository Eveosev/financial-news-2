U.K. two-year note yields fell to
within three basis points of a record after a report showed
jobless-benefit claims increased last month, boosting the case
for central-bank asset purchases to revive economic growth.  Gilts pared earlier gains as stocks advanced, sapping
demand for safer assets. Moody’s Investors Service said it cut
the long-term credit ratings of  Credit Agricole  SA and Societe
Generale SA, citing their exposure to  Greece . The pound weakened
for a fourth day versus the yen.  “Gilts have been trading in anticipation of more
quantitative easing,” said Vatsala Datta, an interest-rate
strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in  London . “People
don’t want to sell core paper” amid the euro area’s debt
crisis, she said.  Two-year yields were little changed at 0.56 percent at 4:42
p.m. in London, after slipping to a record 0.49 percent on Sept.
12 and 0.52 percent earlier today. The 4.5 percent note due
March 2013 traded at 105.79. The 10-year yield climbed two basis
points to 2.43 percent.  Jobless benefit claims rose 20,300 in August after gaining
a revised 33,700 in July, the  Office for National Statistics 
said today in London. That compared with a 35,000 median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Bonds also gained after pay growth at Britain’s factories
slowed in the three months through August. The average pay
settlement among manufacturers dropped to 2.5 percent from a 2.7
percent gain in the quarter through July, the Engineering
Employers Federation and JAM Recruitment said today.  More QE  Bank of England  officials may need to buy as much as 100
billion pounds of securities in a new round of quantitative
easing within three months, policy maker  Adam Posen  said
yesterday. The central bank bought 200 billion pounds of bonds
in a program that ended in early 2010.  The pound declined 0.5 percent to 120.812 yen after
dropping to 120.711 yen, the weakest since January 2009.
Sterling fell 0.3 percent to 86.98 pence per euro, and lost 0.2
percent to $1.5752.  Moody’s put Credit Agricole and  Societe Generale , along
with BNP Paribas SA, on review for a possible downgrade on June
15, citing the risks posed by their investments in Greece.  Demand for the relative safety of U.K. debt was tempered as
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1.5 percent amid optimism the
region’s debt crisis can be contained.  Gilts have returned 3.3 percent this month, compared with
2.7 percent for German  government bonds  and 1 percent for  U.S.
Treasuries , according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
