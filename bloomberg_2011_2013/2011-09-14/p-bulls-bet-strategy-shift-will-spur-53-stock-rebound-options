Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  options traders
are the most bullish in two years amid optimism the company’s
shift away from personal computers will prove successful, even
after disappointing earnings erased $20 billion from the stock.  The ratio of calls to buy shares versus puts to sell has
climbed 7.3 percent in the past month to 1.6, the highest level
since August 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
January $35 calls, priced 53 percent above the shares, have the
largest open interest among Hewlett-Packard options, accounting
for 6.5 percent of 1.28 million outstanding contracts. The stock
plunged 27 percent since Aug. 17 to $22.93 yesterday.  Options traders are speculating the 72-year-old company in
 Palo Alto ,  California , is undervalued after falling to a record
low 5.04 times profit. They’re betting Chief Executive Officer
 Leo Apotheker , 57, will succeed with his expansion in software
and other products that help clients build data centers.  “The options market may be showing more of a true
representation of what people think of the valuation,” Pat Becker Jr., who oversees $2.2 billion including 1.5 million
Hewlett-Packard shares at Becker Capital Management Inc. in
 Portland ,  Oregon , said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“Part of the share price decline here is anger with the
management, and that will dissipate over time.”  Technology Options  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the
benchmark gauge of U.S. equity derivatives prices, fell 7.6
percent to 31.97 as of 4:15 p.m. in New York. The gauge known as
the VIX, which tracks Standard & Poor’s 500 Index options
prices, has averaged 21.27 this year and has fallen 33 percent
from a two-year high on Aug. 8. Implied volatility for the
 Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) ’s 30-day contracts was down
24 percent to 28.52 yesterday since Hewlett-Packard’s plunge
drove it to a 15-month high on Aug. 19.  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of options
protecting against losses on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, declined
9.5 percent to 42.29 today. The volatility gauge has fallen 21
percent since it reached an almost 32-month high on Sept. 12.  Hewlett-Packard shares added 1.5 percent to $23.27 today,
giving them a three-day gain of 3.1 percent.  Apotheker announced a corporate overhaul on Aug. 18, saying
he will spin off the PC unit nine years after Hewlett-Packard
paid $17.6 billion for Compaq Computer Corp. The former CEO of
 SAP AG (SAP)  agreed to purchase Cambridge, England-based Autonomy for
$10.3 billion, shifting the company’s focus to developing
software for businesses. SAP, based in Walldorf,  Germany , is the
world’s largest maker of  business software .  1987 Crash  The CEO reduced the company’s sales forecast on Aug. 18 for
the third time since he joined Hewlett-Packard in November. The
stock plunged 20 percent the next day, the most since the
October 1987 market crash, to $23.60.  “The overwhelming majority of large HP shareholders remain
opposed to the HP/Autonomy deal,”  Toni Sacconaghi , a New York-
based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. who has an
“outperform” rating on the stock, said in the report Sept. 13.
“Investor exasperation with the company is the highest we have
seen in 13 years following the sector.”  Calls had eight of the 10 largest increases in open
interest, or the number of existing contracts, among all
Hewlett-Packard options in the past week, Bloomberg data show.
January $24 calls had the biggest gain, jumping to 12,155
contracts from 948 contracts.  Fewer puts in relation to calls “probably means that at
least a substantial portion of the people out there trading
options are feeling like this might be getting close to a
bottom, and there’s not a lot of additional downside,”  Randy Frederick , the Austin, Texas-based director of trading and
derivatives for Charles Schwab Corp., which has 8 million
brokerage accounts, said in a phone interview yesterday.  Cheapest Valuation  Hewlett-Packard, which has a market capitalization of $45.6
billion, has the lowest price-earnings ratio among the 75
technology companies in the  S&P 500 , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Its valuation of 5.12 times reported income is 61
percent less than the multiple for the index.  “Despite the weak earnings figures, we see value in it,”
Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares
Inc., which manages $4 billion in Raleigh,  North Carolina , said
in a telephone interview yesterday. “By most traditional
valuation measures, it scores as attractive to us.”  Hewlett-Packard shares have lost 46 percent this year
through yesterday, more than 489 companies in the S&P 500. They
closed at $22.58 on Sept. 12, the lowest price since June 2005.
Today, they jumped 1 percent to $23.15.  Lower Prices  Prices for bearish Hewlett-Packard bets are dropping
relative to bullish contracts. Three-month options that pay if
the shares fall 10 percent cost 1.15 times more than calls
priced 10 percent above the current stock price, down from 1.18
before Apotheker’s strategy shift, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price relationship known as skew was the lowest
since January 2009 on Sept. 8, falling to 1.12.  “Because the stock is down so much, the options market
reflects the possibility of a relatively abrupt recovery,”
Ophir Gottlieb, managing director of client services at Livevol
Inc., a San Francisco-based provider of options market
analytics, said in a Sept. 9 interview. “The next news that
moves the market -- if it moves the company -- very well may be
good news, since the bad news is already out.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
