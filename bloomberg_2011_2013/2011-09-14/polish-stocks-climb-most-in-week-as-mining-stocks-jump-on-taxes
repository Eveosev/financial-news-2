Polish stocks climbed for a second
day, with the benchmark index heading for the biggest advance in
in a week, as coal and copper producers jumped after a court
ruling on mining taxes.  The WIG20 Index increased 1.6 percent to 2,230.84 at 2:10
p.m. in Warsaw, trimming this week’s drop to 0.8 percent.  Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB) , the country’s second-largest
publicly traded coal producer, soared as much as 4.6 percent to
112.9 zloty, the biggest intraday gain in a week, and last
traded 3.6 percent higher at 111.8 zloty. The company had
reserves of 73 million zloty ($23 million) at the end of June
for payments of a tax that was struck down by the Constitutional
Tribunal, Tomasz Zieba, a spokesman for the company, said today.  Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA rose for a second day, adding
1.2 percent to 97.7 zloty, after the European Union’s largest
coking-coal producer said it may book financial gains of about
435 million zloty after the court ruled that mining excavations
should not be considered as construction works and should be
free of real-estate taxes.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole copper-mining company,
climbed 1.4 percent to 160 zloty, heading for the highest close
this week. Dariusz Wyborski, a KGHM spokesman, had no immediate
comment on the benefits for the company after the ruling.  PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest lender, added 3.3
percent to 30.9 zloty, increasing for a second day, and  Bank
Pekao SA (PEO)  advanced 2.1 percent to 131.9 zloty, extending
yesterday’s 3.8 percent rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
