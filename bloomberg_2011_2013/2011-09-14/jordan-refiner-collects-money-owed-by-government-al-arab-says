Jordan Petroleum Refinery Co. (JOPT) , the
nation’s only refinery, received partial payments of 384 million
dinars ($542 million) owed by the government and power
companies,  Al Arab Al Yawm  reported.  The refiner, which has a plant with a processing capacity
of 90,000 barrels a day, hopes to collect the rest of the money
so it can pay suppliers and continue meeting Jordan’s needs for
fuel, according to the newspaper. The company said in June it
might have to stop importing raw materials unless it collected
633 million dinars owed by the government and other companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
