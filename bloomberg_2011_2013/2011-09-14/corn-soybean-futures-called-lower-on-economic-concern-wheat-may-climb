What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on concern that a sagging
global economy will reduce demand for food, livestock feed and
fuel made from the grain,  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C
Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana, said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago as worldwide consumption ebbs, Gerlach said. Prices may
rebound later on speculation that cold weather tomorrow may
damage immature U.S. crops across the northern Midwest, he said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open steady to down 0.1 cent
a pound, and soybean-meal futures may open little changed.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT on speculation that an emerging La Nina weather pattern
will reduce global production next year, Gerlach said. Prices on
the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  may fall 2 cents to 5 cents as rain in the southern
U.S. Great Plains in the next week might boost soil moisture for
planting winter crops, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
