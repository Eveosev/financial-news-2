Uruguay’s gross domestic product
expanded 4.8 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
the central bank said today on its  website.   GDP climbed 0.5 percent compared with the first quarter of
2011, the bank said.  Uruguay’s government forecasts economic growth will slow to
6 percent this year from 8.5 percent in 2010.  Analysts estimate this year’s growth at 6.5 percent,
according to a central bank survey of 11 economists published on
Aug. 19.  Quarter-to-quarter growth slowed from 2.1 percent in the
January through March period. The slowdown resulted in part from
a drop in demand for beef, which caused raw materials output to
contract 2.1 percent, said Pablo Moya, an economist at
Montevideo-based research company Oikos.  “In the first quarter the economy grew a lot, so that’s
why the second quarter showed such a great contrast,” Moya said
in a telephone interview.  In June, the central bank raised the overnight lending rate
to 8 percent while signaling that inflationary pressures persist
in the South American country. Consumer prices rose 7.57 percent
in August from a year earlier, the national statistics institute
reported on Sept. 2.  Central bank policy makers are scheduled to meet on Sept.
29 to discuss changes in the benchmark rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
