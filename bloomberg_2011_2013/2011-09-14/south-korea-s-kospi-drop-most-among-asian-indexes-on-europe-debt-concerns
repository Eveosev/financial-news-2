South Korean shares fell, dragging
the benchmark  stock index  to the biggest drop in Asia, amid
concerns Europe’s debt crisis will hurt the global economy.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  lost 3.5 percent to 1,749.16 as of 3 p.m.
close in Seoul, the lowest level since Aug. 22. South Korean
markets were shut for holidays the past two days, during which
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index slipped 2.8 percent on concern
Greece will default and deepen the global economic slowdown. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 2.1 percent in the same period.  Samsung Electronics Co., South Korea’s biggest exporter of
consumer electronics, and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , the nation’s
largest automaker, led losses. Greek Prime Minister  George
Papandreou  will hold a conference call with German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy today.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao today called on developed nations to
cut their debt and create jobs rather than rely on his nation to
bail out the world economy.  “Uncertainties are still high, and we may see volatile
trades for a while,” said Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based fund
manager at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $29 billion. “ Greece  is a de facto default
situation, and the key issue here is how other countries would
react.”  Officials from South Korea’s Finance Ministry held an
emergency meeting yesterday to discuss Greece and the European
sovereign-debt crisis. Officials will enhance monitoring of
capital flows and markets to cope with any turbulence, with the
focus on European banks’ capital movements, the ministry said in
a statement yesterday.  Bear Market   The Kospi sank 12 percent in August, the steepest monthly
loss since October 2008, as signs of slowing U.S. economic
growth and concern Europe’s debt crisis is spreading fueled
speculation that demand for South Korea’s exports will fall. The
gauge is down 22 percent from its May 2 record high. A drop of
20 percent or more signifies a bear market to some investors.  Stocks in the Kospi trade at 8.9 times estimated profit,
the second-lowest valuation in  Asia  after Pakistan’s benchmark
gauge, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
with 9.7 times for the MSCI Emerging-Markets Index.  Samsung Electronics, Asia’s biggest maker of chips, flat
screens and mobile phones, sank 3.5 percent to 753,000 won.
Hyundai Motor dropped 3.3 percent to 191,000 won. Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co., the world’s biggest shipbuilder, lost 5.4
percent to 288,000 won.  Korean Air Lines Co., South Korea’s largest carrier,
tumbled 4.1 percent to 56,200 won after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
cut its stock rating to “sell,” citing a deteriorating
earnings outlook.  Samsung SDI Co. sank 5.6 percent to 110,500 won. HI
Investment & Securities Co. reduced its share-price estimate to
180,000 won from 210,000 won, citing uncertainties over the
company’s solar business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
