California Treasurer Bill Lockyer
said he would complete a sale of $5.4 billion of revenue-
anticipation notes today, one day earlier than planned.  California took orders for 57 percent of the notes from
individual investors on the sale’s first day, said  Tom Dresslar ,
a spokesman for Lockyer. The state will stop those orders at
10:30 a.m. California time and finish the sale to institutions
by day’s end.  “It’s going well,” Dresslar said in an interview. “We
expect strong demand from institutional investors.”  The notes, which mature in June, were offered with yields
ranging from 0.40 percent to 0.55 percent.  That’s as little as 19 basis points above AAA rated tax-
exempt debt maturing in one year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with 144 basis points above that
benchmark on a $10 billion sale of such notes in November. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  In November, Lockyer took orders for 44.3 percent after the
first day of the $10 billion note sale and for 60 percent by the
time the sale was completed. That was down from 75 percent of
the total a year earlier.  High retail demand, Lockyer has said, helps reduce
borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
