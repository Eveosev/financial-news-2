Middle East oil for sale to  Asia 
surged to the highest level in nine months as refiners ramped up
demand amid gains in processing profits.  Qatar Marine jumped 50 cents to a premium of 61 cents a
barrel over its official selling price, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest since December 2010.
Murban from Abu Dhabi’s National Oil Co. climbed 40 cents to a
premium of 53 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed, the biggest
premium since May.  Cargoes of Qatar Marine also sold at a premium of as much
as 80 cents a barrel to the official price, said three traders
of the region’s oil, who declined to be identified because they
aren’t authorized to speak with the media.  Refiners in Asia are raising processing rates to produce
additional heating fuels ahead of winter.  Japan ’s plants
increased their operating rates to 80.6 percent of capacity last
week, up from 79.8 percent, according to the country’s Petroleum
Association today.  Processors are also hoping to cash in on gains in
processing profits. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai, a measure of
profitability, gained $1.22 today to $18.23, the biggest one-day
gain since Aug. 11, according to data from London-based brokers
PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Oman crude for immediate loading rose 11 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $106.47 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in November dropped 0.1 percent to $105.91. Murban
rose 0.3 percent to $110.47.  Dubai crude for November was at a premium of $1.35 a barrel
above supplies loading in January, a market structure known as
backwardation, which suggests demand for oil is higher for
prompt cargoes. That’s up from $1.32 yesterday.  Oman futures for November delivery fell 15 cents to $106.65
a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:34 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,752 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$106.73 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The October Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
widened 28 cents to $6.48 a barrel, according to data from PVM.
The exchange for swaps for November dropped 10 cents to $4.51.  To contact the reporter on this story:
