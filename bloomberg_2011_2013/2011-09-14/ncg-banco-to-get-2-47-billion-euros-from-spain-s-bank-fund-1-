NCG Banco, the lender formed from
savings bank Novacaixagalicia, will seek 2.47 billion euros
($3.4 billion) from  Spain ’s bank-rescue fund and aims for
private investors to buy into the lender within three months.  NCG will increase capital to allow the FROB bailout fund to
take a stake, and has agreed with the fund that the valuation of
the lender should be carried out together with private
investors, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  That agreement, to be signed by Sept. 30, would allow the
FROB to offer those investors options to buy the NCG shares
within three months at the same price paid by the FROB.  Spain’s government tightened  capital requirements  for
lenders in February and gave them until Sept. 30 to meet the new
rules. It is shepherding lenders suffering from the collapse of
the debt-fueled building boom into mergers, and encouraging them
to recapitalize via private investors to reduce the cost to the
public coffers.  NCG Banco held its first board meeting today and named Jose Maria Castellano, the former chief executive of  Inditex SA (ITX) , as
executive chairman, the lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
