Arab Cotton Ginning (ACGC) , an Egyptian
textiles manufacturer, slumped the most in more than a month
after cutting its dividend to about one-fifth of last year’s
payout.  The shares of the Cairo-based company tumbled 6.7 percent,
the biggest intraday decline since Aug. 9, to 3.75 Egyptian
pounds at 11:40 a.m. in Cairo. That gave the company a market
value of 1.02 billion pounds ($171 million). Egypt’s benchmark
 EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  retreated 0.8 percent.  Arab Cotton’s board of directors approved paying a 20-
piaster-per-share dividend, it said today. That compares with a
95 piaster dividend last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
