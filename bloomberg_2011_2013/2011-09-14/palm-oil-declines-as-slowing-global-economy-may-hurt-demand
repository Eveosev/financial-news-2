Palm oil  dropped for a second day
to the lowest level in more than a week on concern that a
slowing world economy may reduce demand for commodities.  The November-delivery contract on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange declined as much as 1 percent to 2,989 ringgit ($970)
per metric ton, the lowest level since Sept. 6, and was at 3,010
ringgit at 4:23 in Kuala Lumpur. Futures have lost 21 percent
this year.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will hold a
conference call with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy today amid increasing speculation that
Greece will default. The Manila-based  Asian Development Bank  cut
its 2011 growth forecast for  Asia  excluding  Japan  to 7.5 percent
from an April estimate of 7.8 percent, according to the Asian
Development Outlook 2011 Update report released today.  “Economy-wise, it is not too bright,” Donny Khor, senior
vice president for futures and options at OSK Investment Bank
Bhd., said by phone from Kuala Lumpur. The bearish news on the
global economy has “a negative impact that continues to weigh
on commodity prices and vegetable oil prices,” he said.  Palm oil’s loss was also spurred by the “spillover of
negative sentiments” from soybean and corn markets, Khor said.  The Department of Agriculture lowered its forecast for U.S.
corn consumption by 3 percent from a month earlier on Sept. 12,
projecting weaker exports, feed demand and ethanol production.
Corn futures for December delivery fell as much as 0.7 percent
to $7.1775, extending yesterday’s 3 percent plunge on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean Stockpiles  Global soybean inventories before the 2012 harvest will
reach 62.55 million tons, compared with 60.95 million tons
estimated in August and 68.82 million tons this year, the USDA
said Sept. 12. Farmers in the U.S., the biggest grower and
exporter, will harvest 3.085 billion bushels this year, above
the 3.032 billion expected in a Bloomberg News survey and up
from 3.056 billion estimated in August.  Soybean futures for November delivery on the Chicago Board
of Trade fell as much as 1 percent to $13.7725 a bushel.  Soybean
oil  for delivery in December shed as much as 1.1 percent to
57.01 cents a pound.  Malaysia’s palm oil exports in September are expected to
slip as buyers such as India and  China  are awaiting a further
decline in prices, Kishore Narne, research head of commodities
with AnandRathi Commodities Ltd., said in a report today.  Exports fell 36 percent to 337,038 tons in the first 10
days of September from a month earlier, market surveyor Intertek
said on Sept. 10. Shipments fell 36 percent to 389,069 in the
same period, Societe Generale de Surveillance said Sept 12.  Palm oil for May delivery on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
dropped 1.1 percent to close at 8,820 yuan ($1,379) per ton,
while soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell 0.9
percent to 10,228 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
