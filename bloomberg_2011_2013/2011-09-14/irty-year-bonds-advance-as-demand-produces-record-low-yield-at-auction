The Treasury sold $13 billion of
30-year securities at a record low yield as investors bet the
 Federal Reserve  will buy more bonds.  The longest-term  U.S. debt  advanced for the first time in
three days as the auction produced the highest demand since
March. Ten-year notes dropped as  France ’s President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said they are
convinced Greece will remain in the  euro zone .  “Everyone is expecting the Fed to take action by
purchasing assets out the curve, which is driving buying in the
long end,” said Larry Milstein, managing director of government
and agency debt trading in New York at R.W. Pressprich & Co., a
fixed-income broker and dealer for institutional investors.  Yields on 30-year bonds dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3.27 percent at 5:01 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.75 percent
securities due in August 2041 increased 1 1/8, or $11.25 per
$1,000 face amount, to 109 3/32.  Benchmark 10-year note yields dropped one basis point to
1.98 percent after falling two days ago to a record 1.8770
percent. Two-year note yields decreased two basis points to 0.19
percent.  The difference in yield between 30-year bonds and two-year
notes fell to 3.09 percentage points after dropping on Sept. 12
to 3.05 percentage points, the narrowest on a closing basis
since August 2010.  Bond Auction Yield  At today’s auction, the bonds drew a yield of 3.310
percent, below the previous record of 3.540 percent at the
February 2009 offering. The average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the Fed’s 20 primary dealers was for a yield
of 3.348 percent.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.85, the
highest since a reading of 3.02 in March.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 39.4 percent of the bonds, compared
with 12.2 percent at the August auction, the lowest level since
February 2008.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 17.3 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 11.6 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  “It was a great auction,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed
income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., which
as a primary dealer is obliged to participate in government debt
offerings. “People are anticipating Operation Twist.”  FOMC Outlook  At its next meeting on Sept. 20-21, the  Federal Open Market
Committee  may decide to swap its holdings of shorter-term
Treasuries with longer maturities under what is known as
Operation Twist to cut borrowing costs and boost the economy.  The Fed may also lower its interest payments on excess
reserves deposited by banks, which may encourage demand for
shorter maturities such as two-year notes.  “We now see a greater than 50 percent chance of a cut in
interest on excess reserves at next week’s FOMC meeting,”  Zach Pandl , senior economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York,
said today in a research note to clients. “We believe the
committee would cut to 10 basis points instead of zero.”  Bonds tumbled on Aug. 11 as speculation Fed policies will
stoke inflation sapped demand at the $16 billion 30-year
offering. The yield gained as much as 29 basis points, the most
on an intraday basis since November 2008.  Weekly Offerings  Today’s auction is the last of three note and bond
offerings this week totaling $66 billion. The Treasury sold $21
billion in 10-year debt yesterday at a record low yield of 2
percent and $32 billion of three-year notes on Sept. 12 at an
all-time low yield of 0.334 percent.  Treasury 10-year notes dropped and the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rallied 2.3 percent after Sarkozy and Merkel said
after speaking to Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  by
phone that  Greece ’s budget cuts will restore stability to
markets amid international calls for European leaders to step up
efforts to contain the debt crisis.  Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s government won
a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies on its 54 billion
euro ($74 billion) austerity package, paving the way for final
approval of the legislation.  Facing calls to widen support for indebted European
countries,  China ’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  indicated at the  World
Economic Forum  in Dalian, China, that developed nations should
cut deficits and open markets rather than rely on the Asian
nation to bail out the world economy.  Treasuries pared their drop earlier today after the
Commerce Department reported that U.S. retail sales were flat in
August after a revised increase of 0.3 percent in the prior
month. The median forecast of 83 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for 0.2 percent gain.  “Retail sales are weaker than anticipated, but there
wasn’t a huge amount of hope for the numbers,” said Guy LeBas,
chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
