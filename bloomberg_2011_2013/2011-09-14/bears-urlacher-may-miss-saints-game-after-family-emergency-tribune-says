Chicago  Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher may miss the second game of the season after leaving
the National Football League team yesterday for personal
reasons, according to the  Chicago Tribune .  Urlacher, 33, left Chicago to attend to an unspecified
emergency regarding his mother in Arizona, the newspaper
reported without saying where it obtained the information.  He is expected to be out of town for several days and may
miss the team’s Sept. 18 game against the  New Orleans Saints ,
according to the Tribune.  A seven-time Pro Bowl selection, Urlacher was named the
National Football Conference Defensive Player of the Week today.
He had 10 tackles, an interception and a fumble return for a
touchdown in the Bears’ season-opening 30-12 victory over the
 Atlanta Falcons  last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
