Egypt  plans to raise 15.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($2.6 billion) over the next week at auctions of
government debt, the largest amount this quarter.  The Arab country’s central bank will seek bids for 2.5
billion pounds in six-month notes and 3.5 billion pounds of one-
year securities tomorrow, according to Central Bank of Egypt
data on Bloomberg. It plans sales of three-month and nine-month
bills on Sept. 18 valued at 2 billion pounds and 3.5 billion
pounds, respectively, according to the data.  The lender said earlier this week it will offer a combined
4 billion pounds in two-year and three-year fixed-rate bonds on
Sept. 19.  One-year treasury bills will “conservatively” attract bis
at a yield of 13.75 percent to 13.95 percent, said Ahmed Kheir
Eldin, a fixed-income trader at Cairo-based Bank of Alexandria.
Two-year and three-year bond yields will reach 14.2 percent and
14.5 percent, respectively, he said. “It’s very hard to expect
investors to bid lower,” said Kheir Eldin. “The government is
also more likely to accept this because it’s the end of the
quarter and it has to meet financing requirements.”  Yields Fall  Egyptian treasury bill yields soared last week as the
government’s need for financing pushed it to accept the highest
borrowing costs in almost three years. The rate on one-year
securities climbed 62 basis points, or 0.62 percentage point, to
13.6 percent. The  central bank , which holds the auctions on
behalf of the  finance ministry , canceled the sale of three-month
and nine-month notes on Sept. 11.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 fell three basis points to 5.41 percent at 4:20 p.m.
in Cairo. The pound’s 12-month non-deliverable forwards lost 0.5
percent to 6.65 per dollar, reflecting the expectation for the
currency to weaken 10 percent over that period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
