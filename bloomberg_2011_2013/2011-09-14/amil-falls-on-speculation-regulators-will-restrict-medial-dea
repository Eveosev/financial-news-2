Amil Participacoes SA (AMIL3) , a Brazilian
health insurer, fell in Sao Paulo on speculation antitrust
regulators will impose restrictions on its acquisition of Medial
Saude SA.  Amil dropped 3.3 percent to 16.72 reais at the close of
trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the lowest price since Aug.
26. The benchmark Bovespa index increased 1.3 percent.  The antitrust arms of  Brazil ’s Justice and Finance
ministries recommended the country’s antitrust regulator Cade
require Amil to sell Medial’s assets in the Sao Paulo
metropolitan area, newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Amil agreed to buy control of Medial in November 2009. The
deal hasn’t yet been approved by antitrust regulators.  An official with an external public relations firm that
represents Amil said the company wouldn’t comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
