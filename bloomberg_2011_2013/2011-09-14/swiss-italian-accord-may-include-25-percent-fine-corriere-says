Undeclared assets held by Italians
in  Switzerland  may be taxed by as much as 25 percent under an
agreement between the two nations on cross-border bank accounts,
daily  Corriere della Sera  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  The fine, in line with accords reached by Germany and the
U.K. with Switzerland last month, would be as much as five times
the fee Italy charged in a 2009-2010 amnesty on tax evaders,
Milan-based Corriere reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
