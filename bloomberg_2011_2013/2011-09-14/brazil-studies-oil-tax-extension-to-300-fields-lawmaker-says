Brazil may extend an oil tax to
about 300 fields that are currently exempt as Rio de Janeiro and
other states seek a bigger share of revenue from  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and other producers.  The extension is among proposals that Energy Minister
Edison Lobao and Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  discussed with
lawmakers today, said Paulo Teixeira, leader of President Dilma Rousseff’s Workers’ Party in the lower house, after the meeting
in Brasilia.  Rio de Janeiro Governor Sergio Cabral, an ally of
Rousseff’s government, is seeking to boost revenue from oil
taxes, which are mostly derived from fields in his state and
operated by government-run Petrobras. Brazil collects about 11
billion reais ($6.4 billion) a year from the so-called special
participation tax levied on the country’s most productive
fields, said Senator Delcidio Amaral, who was also in the
meeting.  In addition to the special participation tax, Brazil
collects 10 billion reais from royalties on all  oil fields , said
Amaral.  Rousseff said earlier today that her government will
respect existing oil contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
