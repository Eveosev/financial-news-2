Kenya ’s six-month borrowing costs
climbed to the highest in a decade at the biggest sale of the
maturity this year as the  central bank  received fewer bids for
the amount of debt it had offered.  The yield on the 182-day bills rose to 11.935 percent, the
highest since July 2001, from 9.285 percent at a sale on Sept.
7, the Nairobi-based Central Bank of Kenya said in an e-mailed
statement today. The bank issued 2 billion shillings ($22
million) of the debt, having received 3.2 billion shillings of
bids, or 49 percent of the 6.5 billion shillings offered.
Today’s sale is the biggest of six-month bills this year,
according to a data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The low subscription indicates a market that will only
take the offer at higher returns,” Fred Mweni, managing
director of Nairobi-based Tsavo Securities Ltd., said by phone.  The yield on 91-day debt climbed to 11.685 percent, the
highest in 10 years, at last week’s sale as inflation in  East
Africa ’s largest economy surged for a 10th month in August,
reaching 16.7 percent. The worst regional drought in 60 years
boosted food prices and the shilling weakened to a 17-year low.  Kenya usually sells 182-day bills every two weeks.  “The decision to bring forward the six-month auction and
offer a substantially huge amount compared to past offers is due
to the maturing debt that the bank has to pay and also to
provide funds for the government operations,” Peter Mwirigi,
chief dealer at Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by
phone today.  Kenya’s monetary policy committee holds a special meeting
today to review efforts to curb inflation and defend the
shilling.  The  Central Bank of Kenya  left its key lending rate
unchanged at 6.25 percent on July 27, saying that inflation is
being fuelled by drought that can’t be influenced by higher
 interest rates .  The interbank lending rate rose to 5.4599 percent from
yesterday’s 5.2907 percent the bank said in a statement on its
website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
