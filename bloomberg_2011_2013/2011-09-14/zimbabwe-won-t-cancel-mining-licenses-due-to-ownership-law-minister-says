Zimbabwe won’t cancel mining
company licenses because of the country’s ownership law, Obert
Mpofu said.  “We have no intentions of canceling of any licenses,”
Mpofu said in a speech today at a mining industry conference in
the capital, Harare. “There are negotiations with some
parties.”  Zimbabwe have asked foreign companies to submit plans on
how they will meet a law to sell 51 percent of local assets to
black Zimbabweans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
