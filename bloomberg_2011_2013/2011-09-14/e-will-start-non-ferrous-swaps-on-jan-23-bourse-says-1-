The London Metal Exchange will
start trading non-ferrous metals swaps on Jan. 23, 2012, the
exchange said in an e-mailed notice to its members.  The swaps for aluminum, two aluminum alloys, zinc, tin,
nickel, copper and lead will be based on delisted so-called
over-the-counter Cleared Average Price Swaps. They will be
traded on the exchange’s electronic platform LMESelect and on
the telephone, the exchange said today.  The instruments will be cleared on LCH.Clearnet Ltd, which
clears LME contracts, said Joanna Stuart, head of market
surveillance at the bourse.  “We are responding to the demands from our members as well
as from users of LME,” Stuart said by phone. “It will be ideal
for the physical market. It’s the best way for hedging against
physical contracts.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
