Club Mediterranee (CU)  SA, the French
operator of 75 resorts worldwide, said full-year operating
income from its villages will improve as winter sales offset a
decline in business to North Africa following political unrest.  “Over-performance delivered during the winter should
enable the group to offset the unfavorable impact of these
events," the Paris-based company said in a statement today.
‘‘Winter sales are off to a very encouraging start.’’  European travel company earnings have been affected by
political unrest in North Africa this year. Club Med said its
third-quarter business volume for destinations in Morocco,
Tunisia and  Egypt  was 20 million euros lower year-on-year,
reducing growth in total business volume by 5.9 percent.  Revenue slipped 1.9 percent to 323 million euros ($441
million) in the three months to July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
