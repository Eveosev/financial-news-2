TMX Group Inc. (X) , the Toronto Stock
Exchange owner considering a takeover bid by a group of Canadian
banks and pension funds, had 65.5 percent of the Canadian market
for  stock trading  in August, up 0.5 percentage point from July.  Alpha Group, whose owners include  Canada ’s six largest
banks, had 19.6 percent of the market by number of shares traded
last month, down from about 19.7 percent in July, according to
monthly  statistics  from the Investment Industry Regulatory
Organization of Canada.  The TMX numbers include TMX Select, the Toronto-based
exchange owner’s alternative trading system that launched in
July, which had around 0.9 percent of the market for stocks in
Canada in August.  TMX’s market share has fallen from August 2010, when the
Toronto Stock Exchange and  TSX Venture Exchange  had 73 percent
of the market. Alpha had 18.9 percent of the market in the same
period. TMX, which had 99 percent of stock trading at the start
of 2007, has seen its share decline with the emergence of
alternative trading systems including Alpha, Pure Trading and
Instinet’s Chi-X platforms in Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
