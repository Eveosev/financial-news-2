Novo Nordisk A/S said its
experimental insulin degludec helped reduce diabetics’ blood-
sugar levels as well as a rival product made by Sanofi in a
study, even when patients didn’t take the drug at set times.  Patients taking degludec once a day at varying times fared
about as well as those taking Sanofi’s Lantus at a fixed hour,
according to a study released today at the  European Association
for the Study of Diabetes conference  in Lisbon.  The Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company is trying to show
doctors and regulators degludec can be used safely at any time
of day, allowing it to snatch market share from Lantus, the
world’s best-selling insulin. Degludec may reap annual sales of
12 billion Danish kroner ($2.2 billion) by 2017, according to
Alistair Campbell, a London-based analyst at Berenberg Bank.  A submission with regulators will come “very soon, in the
next very few months” in  Europe  and the U.S., Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Novo’s chief science officer, said in an interview at
the Lisbon meeting.  In the 26-week trial, patients were asked to alternate the
timing of insulin injections to suit their daily activities,
creating dosing intervals of between eight and 40 hours,
according to an abstract of the study.  “Insulin degludec could potentially offer a real advance
in diabetes management for patients who are challenged to
maintain exactly the same schedule from day to day,” Stephen
Atkin, the study’s lead author and the head of academic
endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at  York Hull Medical
School  in  England , said in a statement sent by Novo.  Diabetics inject insulin because they don’t make enough of
the hormone to prevent sugar from building up in their blood.  To contact the reporter for this story:
