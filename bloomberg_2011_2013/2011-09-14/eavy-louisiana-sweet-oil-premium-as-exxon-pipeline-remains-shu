The premium for Heavy Louisiana
Sweet oil rose two days after  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  shut about 15,000
barrels a day of oil production in the  Gulf of Mexico  following
a leak.  Partial output was expected to resume by today, Russell
Johnson, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday. He
didn’t respond to an e-mail today asking if any output had
resumed. About 2.3 gallons of oil was released and the company
is evaluating repair options, according to an e-mailed statement
from the company.  Chevron shut its Main Pass and Cypress pipeline systems
Sept. 12 to investigate the incident, Johnson said yesterday.
The Main Pass system helps supply oil to Chevron’s Empire
terminal, a delivery point for Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
increased $2 to $27.50 a barrel at 4:29 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s
premium gained $1.20 to $24.70.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 75 cents to $22 while Poseidon increased 50 cents to
$22 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium added 75 cents to $20.50 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 70 cents.
Thunder Horse’s premium decreased 75 cents to $24.50 above the
benchmark.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened $2.25 to $13.25 a
barrel.  The premium for Syncrude lost 25 cents to $11.25 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
