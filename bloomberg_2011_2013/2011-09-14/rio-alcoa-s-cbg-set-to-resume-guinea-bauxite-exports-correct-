(Corrects date of shutdown in second paragraph.)  Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee,
which is owned by the West African nation,  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  and
Alcoa Inc., expects to resume exports of the ore used in
aluminum “this evening or tomorrow,” said Director General
Kemoko Toure.  Shipments were halted Sept. 12 after a conveyor was
damaged, he said by phone from the city of Kamsar, where the
company operates a port.  To contact the reporter on this story:
