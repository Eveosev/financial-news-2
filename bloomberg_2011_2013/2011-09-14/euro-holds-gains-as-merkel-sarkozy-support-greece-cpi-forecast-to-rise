The euro declined versus the dollar
and the yen, paring its first weekly advance this month.  The 17-nation currency dropped 0.5 percent to $1.3815 at
8:09 a.m. in  London , trimming this week’s gain to 1.2 percent.
The euro dropped 0.3 percent to 106.11 yen, trimming its advance
over the past five days to 0.1 percent.  The currency rose against 14 of its 16 major counterparts
this week as euro-area finance ministers prepare to meet today
in Wroclaw,  Poland . ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet pressed
euro-area governments to take decisive action to halt the debt
crisis and show “unity of purpose” at today’s gathering.  The ECB said yesterday it will lend dollars to banks in the
region in a series of three-month loans. The Frankfurt-based
organization said it will coordinate with the  Federal Reserve 
and other central banks to conduct three separate dollar
liquidity operations to ensure lenders have enough of the
currency through the end of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
