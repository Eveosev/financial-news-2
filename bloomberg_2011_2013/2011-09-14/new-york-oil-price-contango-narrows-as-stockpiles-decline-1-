The price gap between front-month
and November crude oil futures in  New York  fell for a sixth day
after settling yesterday at the narrowest in almost three years.  Crude for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was at $89.39 a barrel in electronic trading at 10:54
a.m. Singapore time, 6 cents below the November contract. On a
settlement basis, the discount was 7 cents yesterday, the
smallest for front-month futures since November 2008, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oilâ€™s discount to future months, known as a price contango,
has shrunk as supplies depleted at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for New York-traded contracts. Crude stockpiles
have fallen for six weeks to 32.69 million barrels, the lowest
since November 2010, according to the Energy Department.  October futures were briefly at a premium today to the
November contract, based on most-recent transactions about a
minute apart. A positive spread is referred to as backwardation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
