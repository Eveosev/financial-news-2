Google Inc. (GOOG)  and Facebook Inc. were
sued for allegedly infringing a patent covering technology that
provides auto-completion for computer users searching the
Internet.  Google, the world’s most-used search engine, and  Palo Alto ,
 California-based Facebook , the world’s largest social network,
infringed on the auto-completion technology patent by
incorporating it on their websites, officials of Auto-Completion
Solutions LLC contend in their lawsuit.  The companies’ use of the patented function without
permission harmed ACS, which deserves “to recover damages
adequate to compensate it for such infringement,” lawyers for
the Frisco, Texas-based company said in a complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  Other Internet information providers named in the complaint
include Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo! Inc. and Linkedin
Corp., which like Google, is based in  Mountain View , California.  “We have not yet received a copy of the complaint and
won’t be able to comment until we’ve had a chance to review
it,” Jim Prosser, a Google spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Evonne Gomez Morantes, a Yahoo spokeswoman, and Erin
O’Hara, a spokeswoman for Linkedin, declined in e-mails to
comment on the suit. Andrew Noyes, a spokesman for Facebook,
didn’t immediately return calls and e-mails seeking comment.  The case is Auto-Completion Solutions LLC v. Facebook Inc.,
11-cv-809, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
