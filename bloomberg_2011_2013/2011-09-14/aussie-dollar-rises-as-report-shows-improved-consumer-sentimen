The Australian currency dropped to
a one-month low against the dollar as a revised method of
calculating inflation made it less likely the central bank will
raise  interest rates .  The Aussie sank against the majority of its most-traded
counterparts after  Australia ’s bureau of statistics released its
methodology for calculating seasonally adjusted inflation that
indicated the central bank’s core measures may have been lower
last quarter. The  New Zealand dollar  slid for a fourth day
against the yen as U.S. retail sales stagnated.  The revised methodology means the  Reserve Bank  of Australia
will likely have to reduce its CPI forecast for the June-
December period, Joaquin Vespignani, an economist in Sydney at
Barclays Plc, wrote in a research note today. “This implies the
RBA will have more reason to keep monetary policy unchanged for
the rest of this year.”  The Australian dollar fell as much as 1.3 percent to
$1.0178, its weakest level since Aug. 11, before trading at
$1.0226 at 12:21 p.m. in  New York  from $1.0312 yesterday. The
Aussie slid 1.2 percent to 78.44 yen, from 79.35.  New Zealand’s currency declined 0.2 percent to 82.11 U.S.
cents from 82.29 cents and slipped 0.6 percent to 62.97 yen from
63.33 yen.  New Settings  Under the updated settings, the trimmed mean  consumer price
index  rose 0.7 percent in the second quarter and the weighted
mean advanced 0.5 percent, the bureau said. It reported July 27
the trimmed mean and weighted median each increased at a 0.9
percent quarterly pace.  Traders are betting the RBA will cut its benchmark interest
rate by 155 basis points in the next 12 months, up from 140
basis points yesterday, according to a Credit Suisse Index based
on swaps.  The Reserve Bank of  New Zealand  will hold a policy meeting
tomorrow. The central bank will leave its official cash rate
unchanged at 2.5 percent, all 15 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast.  The Australian dollar has lost 2.4 percent this year, the
second-worst performance after the Swedish krona, which fell 2.8
percent, among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
