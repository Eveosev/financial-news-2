Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Europe ’s
biggest phone company, is sticking to its strategy of increasing
business with online services after divesting the jobs platform
that was part of its Scout24 operations.  “The Internet business is still interesting for us and the
Scout24 group is playing an important role in that,” Marion Kessing, a Deutsche Telekom spokeswoman, said by phone.  Deutsche Telekom sold the JobScout24 board, with 3.36
million users and more than 250,000 listed jobs in Germany, to
CareerBuilder.com, the U.S. company  said yesterday . The board
was “one of the smaller parts” of the Scout24 unit, which runs
sites including AutoScout24 and property platform
ImmobilienScout24, Kessing said. JobScout24 has better
profitability prospects as part of CareerBuilder.com, she said,
declining to say how much the business was sold for.  The Bonn-based company has said it aims to increase revenue
from online consumer services, which include music and games
downloads and security software, to 2 billion euros ($2.74
billion) to 3 billion euros by 2015 from 800 million euros in
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
