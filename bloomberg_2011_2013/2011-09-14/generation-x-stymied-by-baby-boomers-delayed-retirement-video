A recent study conducted by the 
Center for Work-Life Policy surveyed more than 1,170 Generation 
X workers, the 45 million Americans born between 1965 and 1978, 
and found that many have struggled to find work, gone deeply 
into debt for degrees aimed at making them more competitive, and
have been held back in the workplace by Baby Boomers who aren’t
retiring on schedule. Bloomberg's Willow Bay reports. (Source:
