Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the world’s
largest maker of rechargeable batteries, will increase the
portion of parts it buys outside  Japan  this fiscal year to help
cut procurement costs 500 billion yen ($6.5 billion).  The company will acquire about 57 percent of its parts and
materials abroad in the year to March, up from 43 percent two
years ago, Masaaki Fujita, who oversees the company’s
procurement and distribution operations, said in  Osaka  today.
The overseas ratio will probably continue increasing as the
company intends to expand purchases in  Asia , he told reporters.  The company is also  moving  the headquarters of its $57
billion procurement operation to  Singapore  from Osaka in the
year starting April 2012, Fujita said. The shifting of
procurement comes after the company has said its cutting jobs,
consolidating units and increasing the portion of production by
outside contractors to revive profit to levels before the global
financial crisis.  “It’s not easy to continuously reduce cost without a bold
move” amid a strengthening yen and rising material prices, said
Fujita.  The world’s No. 4 television manufacturer, which spent
about 4.4 trillion yen last fiscal year buying parts and
materials, is cutting the number of its suppliers by about 40
percent globally in two years to March 2013, while aiming to
find new suppliers in Asian countries including Malaysia and
 Thailand , Fujita said.  The company has said it expects to cut procurement expenses
by 500 billion yen in each of the three years to March 2013.  Japan Dependence  Panasonic bought about 57 percent of its parts and
materials in Japan and 22 percent from  China  in the year ended
March 2010, Fujita said, without providing the figure for the
following fiscal year. Purchases from Japan may decline to 40
percent in the year ending March 2013 and those from China will
increase to 30 percent, he said.  Components and materials from Asia, excluding China and
Japan, may account for 20 percent of the total in the next
financial year, up from 11 percent three years ago, he said.  Panasonic rose 1 percent to 747 yen at the 3 p.m. close in
 Tokyo  trading. The shares have declined 35 percent this year,
compared with the 17 percent drop in the broader Topix index.  The maker of Viera televisions is building a new plant in
 Vietnam  to make substrates used in smartphones, Panasonic said
earlier this month. It will start production at new appliance
factories in India and Brazil in the second half of 2012, the
company said in April.  Panasonic plans over two years to cut 17,000 jobs,
eliminate overlapping operations, consolidate units and expand
outsourcing of production to raise its operating margin to at
least 5 percent in the year ending March 2013 from 3.5 percent
last fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
