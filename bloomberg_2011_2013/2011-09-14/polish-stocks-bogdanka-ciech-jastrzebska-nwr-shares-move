Poland ’s WIG20 Index advanced
23.78, or 1.1 percent, to 2,219.67 at 3:09 p.m. in Warsaw,
heading for the biggest gain in a week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB)  , Poland’s second-
largest coal producer, rose for a second day, adding 3.9 zloty,
or 3.6 percent, to 111.8 zloty. The company had reserves of 73
million zloty ($23 million) at the end of June for payments of a
tax that was struck down by the country’s Constitutional
Tribunal, Tomasz Zieba, a company spokesman, said by phone
today.  Ciech SA (CIE)   sank 0.3 zloty, or 2.7 percent, to 10.95
zloty, heading for the lowest close since the chemical producer
started trading in Warsaw in 2005. ING Groep NV cut its price
estimate for the stock to 12 zloty from 32.1 zloty.  Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA (JSW PW), the European
Union’s largest coking coal producer, increased as much as 2.6
percent to 99 zloty and last traded 0.8 percent higher at 97.25
zloty. Jastrzebska may book financial gains of about 435 million
zloty after the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that mining
excavations shouldn’t be considered construction works and
should be free of real-estate taxes, the company said in a
regulatory statement late yesterday.  New Word Resources Plc (NWR PW) declined 0.52 zloty, or 1.9
percent, to 26.23 zloty in Warsaw trading, extending this week’s
drop to 5.4 percent. The Czech Republic’s largest coking coal
producer was cut to “sell” at UniCredit SpA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
