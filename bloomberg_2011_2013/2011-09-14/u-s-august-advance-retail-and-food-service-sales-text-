Following is the text of the
monthly retail sales report from the Commerce Department.  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that advance
estimates of U.S. retail and food services sales for
August, adjusted for seasonal variation and holiday and
trading-day differences, but not for price changes, were
$389.5 billion, virtually unchanged (+/-0.5%)* from the
previous month and 7.2 percent (+/-0.7%) above August
2010. Total sales for the June through August 2011 period
were up 7.9 percent (+/-0.7%) from the same period a year
ago. The June to July 2011 percent change was revised from
+0.5 percent (+/-0.5%)* to +0.3 percent (+/-0.2%).  Retail trade sales were up 0.1 percent (+/-0.5%)*
from July 2011, and 7.5 percent (+/-0.7%) above last year.
Gasoline stations sales were up 20.8 percent (+/-1.7%)
from August 2010 and nonstore retailers sales were up 10.4
percent (+/-2.5%) from last year.  The advance estimates are based on a subsample of the
Census Bureau's full retail and food services sample. A
stratified random sampling method is used to select
approximately 5,000 retail and food services firms whose
sales are then weighted and benchmarked to represent the
complete universe of over three million retail and food
services firms. Responding firms account for approximately
65% of the MARTS dollar volume estimate. For an
explanation of the measures of sampling variability
included in this report, please see the Reliability of
Estimates section on the last page of this publication.  The Advance Monthly Sales for Retail and Food
Services for September is scheduled to be released October
14, 2011 at 8:30 a.m. EDT.  For information, visit the Census Bureau's Web site
at < http://www.census.gov/retail >.  * The 90 percent confidence interval includes zero. The
Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical
evidence to conclude that the actual change is different
than zero.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department
