Oil options volatility slipped as
the underlying futures retreated from the highest level in
almost six weeks after the U.S. reported that fuel inventories
climbed, demand dropped and retail sales stalled.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 39.1 percent at 2 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 40 percent yesterday.  Oil for October delivery fell $1.09, or 1.2 percent, to
$89.12 a barrel at 2:05 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures settled at $90.21 a barrel yesterday, the
highest price since Aug. 3. Oil has fallen 2.5 percent this
year. Crude for November delivery retreated 99 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $89.29 a barrel.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
November $70 puts, with 3,529 lots changing hands as of 2:18
p.m. The options gained 3 cents to 52 cents a barrel. October
$90 calls, the next-most active contract, fell 90 cents to 33
cents a barrel with 2,868 lots trading. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of crude.  October options expire at the close of Nymex floor trading
tomorrow.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  October $90 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 6,206 lots changing hands. They rose 44
cents to $1.23 a barrel. The next-most active options, October
$85 puts, retreated 46 cents to 14 cents a barrel on volume of
4,528.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
