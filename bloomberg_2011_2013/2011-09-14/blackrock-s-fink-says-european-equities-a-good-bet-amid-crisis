BlackRock Inc.’s Chief Executive
Officer Laurence D. Fink said European equities such as Nestle
SA and Siemens AG are good bets as they have fallen amidst the
debt crisis in the region.  “They are hated right now because of the instability,”
Fink said today at a conference in  New York  organized by CNBC
and Institutional Investor.  BlackRock was co-founded in 1988 by Fink, who has since
built the firm through a series of acquisitions including the
December 2009 purchase of  Barclays Global Investors . The firm
manages $3.66 trillion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
