Russian stocks erased losses and
climbed a second day as bets  China  may still offer support to
ease  Europe ’s debt burden lifted appetite for riskier stocks.  The 30-stock Micex Index advanced 0.5 percent to 1,504.92
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, paring an earlier gain of as
much as 1.5 percent. OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s natural gas export
monopoly, jumped 1.4 percent. VTB Group, Russia’s second-biggest
lender, rose 2.9 percent. OAO Magnit, the nation’s largest food
retailer by market value, surged 4.1 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index slipped 0.1 percent to 1,570.38.  Stocks in Europe rebounded on speculation Germany and
France will confirm support for  Greece  and after Caijing
magazine reported China is willing to buy the bonds of nations
hit by the debt crisis, citing  Zhang Xiaoqiang , a vice chairman
of the National Development and Reform Commission.  “The bounce today is just another bear market rally,”
Dmitry Malykhin, chief investment officer at Moscow-based hedge
fund Da Vinci Capital, said by phone today. “We prefer to keep
our cash on the sidelines because it could be a bonaza for us if
things get to distressed levels like in 2008.”  Stocks in Russia have slumped 9.7 percent so far this
quarter as fears the U.S. economic recovery is stalling and the
European debt crisis is spreading sapped demand for emerging-
market assets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has slumped 17
percent over the same period.  The Micex has lost 11 percent in 2011 and trades at 5.6
times analysts’ earnings estimates. That compares with a 20
percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index, which trades at 9.4
times estimated earnings, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
