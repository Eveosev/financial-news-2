Tokyo Electric Power Co. plans to
raise electricity rates by 15 percent for three years starting
from April, the Asahi newspaper reported today. The utility said
the report isn’t accurate.  The company known as Tepco informed a government committee
investigating its finances of the plan, the newspaper  reported ,
without saying how it got the information. Tepco is considering
restoring bonuses for employees when the price increase ends in
the year ending March 2016, the Asahi said.  Tepco may face as much as 11 trillion yen ($143 billion) in
compensation claims, according to Bank of America Corp.’s
Merrill Lynch unit, after the three reactor meltdowns at its
Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant caused the evacuation of 160,000 people
and devastated businesses and agriculture near the station.
Increasing electricity rates has been suggested as one way to
help foot the damages bill.  Tepco  denied  the Asahi report in a statement today, saying
the company needs to cut expenses and secure funds through
“sweeping rationalization and optimization of management.” The
companies business conditions are “very severe,” it said.  Atsuhito Uemaru, an official of the government committee,
declined to comment.  Tepco also today denied it has inappropriately estimated
costs used to calculate electricity prices.  The company overestimated costs used to calculate tariffs
for its customers for the decade since 1998, Kazuhiko Shimokobe,
a lawyer and the chairman of the committee overseeing the
company’s finances, said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
