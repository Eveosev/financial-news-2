Rutgers University  received the
biggest gift in its history, $27 million from an anonymous
donor, to establish 18 endowed chairs in subjects ranging from
business education to the sciences.  The donation will be structured as a challenge grant, the
 New Brunswick , New Jersey-based university said today in a
 statement  on its website. For every $1.5 million raised for a
chair that meets the donor’s criteria, a matching gift will be
provided.  “Endowed chairs provide permanent sources of funding for
faculty positions, enabling the university to attract and retain
internationally acclaimed leaders in high-priority academic
fields,” Carol Herring, president of Rutgers University
Foundation, said in the statement.  Including the anonymous gift, the university raised a
record $137.4 million in private donations in the 2010-2011
academic year, the foundation said. Rutgers, founded in 1766,
has more than 58,000 students.  To contact the reporter on this story:
