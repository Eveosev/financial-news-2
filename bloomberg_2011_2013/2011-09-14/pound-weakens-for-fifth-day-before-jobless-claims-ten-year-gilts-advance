The pound fell for a fifth day
against the dollar before a report that economists said will
show U.K. jobless claims increased last month, giving the
central bank more reason to boost asset purchases. Gilts rose.  Sterling slid to an eight-month low against the greenback
and fell to the weakest since January 2009 versus the yen.
Claims for unemployment benefit rose 35,000 from July, when they
climbed 37,100, according to a Bloomberg News survey before
today’s report. The  Bank of England  may need to buy as much as
100 billion pounds ($157 billion) of securities in a new round
of quantitative easing within three months, policy maker  Adam Posen  said yesterday.  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5743 at 9:06 a.m. in
 London , after sliding to $1.5707, the lowest since Jan. 12. The
currency dropped 0.5 percent to 120.093 yen, after reaching
120.751. It was little changed at 86.76 pence per euro.  Britain’s currency has depreciated 5.1 percent in the past
12 months against a basket of nine major peers, the second-worst
performer after the dollar, which fell 6.4 percent, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  The 10-year gilt yield dropped three basis points to 2.39,
and the two-year yield fell two basis points to 0.54 percent.  Gilts have returned 3.3 percent this month, compared with
2.7 percent for German  government bonds  and 1 percent for U.S.
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
