Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher has left the team following the death of his mother,
who he once called “my heart.”  Lavoyda Urlacher died unexpectedly two days ago at her home
in  Texas , the linebacker said in an e-mailed statement. He
didn’t address his status for the Bears’ Sept. 18 game against
the  New Orleans Saints , nor did he list his mother’s age or
details of her death.  “My first priority right now is to be with my family as we
mourn her loss and make the arrangement to lay her to rest,”
Urlacher said. “This is a very difficult and emotional time for
us and I sincerely ask that you respect our privacy.”  Urlacher, 33, left the National Football League team
yesterday, the  Chicago Tribune  reported.  A seven-time Pro Bowl selection, Urlacher was named the
National Football Conference Defensive Player of the Week today.
He had 10 tackles, an interception and a fumble return for a
touchdown in the Bears’ season-opening 30-12 victory over the
 Atlanta Falcons  last week.  “My mom is my heart,” Urlacher told  ESPN Magazine  in
2002.  Lavoyda married Brad Urlacher, Brian’s father, at age 16
and had all three of her children before the age of 19,
according to the Tribune. She and Brad divorced at age 25 and
she raised her children -- Brian, Sheri and Casey -- in
Lovington,  New Mexico . She was living in Mount Pleasant, Texas,
when she died, the Tribune said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
