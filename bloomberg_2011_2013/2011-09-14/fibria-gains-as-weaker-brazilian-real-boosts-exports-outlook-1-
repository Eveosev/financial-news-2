Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world’s
largest pulp producer, gained the most in one week in Sao Paulo
as the real weakened, boosting the outlook for the company’s
exports.  Fibria rose 3.8 percent to 16.70 reais at the close of
trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the highest price since Aug.
2. The real fell 0.8 percent to 1.7229 per  U.S. dollar , the
lowest since November.  “A weaker real is surely a positive thing for the
company,”  Pedro Galdi , head strategist at SLW Corretora
brokerage, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “Pulp
prices have declined this year, so a weaker currency helps to
offset that.”  Exports accounted for 84 percent of Fibria’s second-quarter
sales, according to the company’s website.  The real fell for a ninth day, the longest losing streak
since 2005, on speculation European companies may be
repatriating their earnings from the Latin American country to
boost their capital as the debt crisis in the euro zone deepens.  Brazil ’s government is concerned European companies may
take money out of the country as the economic crisis worsens in
their home region, Valor Economico reported, without saying how
it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
