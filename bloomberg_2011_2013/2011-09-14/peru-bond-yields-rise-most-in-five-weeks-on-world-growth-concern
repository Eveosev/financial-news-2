Peruvians bonds fell, pushing up
yields the most in five weeks, on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
and stagnation in the U.S. will derail global growth, sapping
demand for emerging market assets.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 5.51 percent at 1:42 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the steepest rise in yields
since Aug. 8. The security’s price fell 0.31 centimo to 116.14
centimos per sol.  U.S. Commerce Department figures today showed retail sales
unexpectedly stagnated in August, following a 0.3 percent gain
for July. European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said he is
close to proposing options on joint euro-area bond sales, while
Germany is against using euro bonds as a tool to help solve
Europe’s debt problems.  “Investors tend to unwind positions in riskier markets and
bring those assets home” when concern mounts about the global
economy, said  Diego Donadio , a Latin America strategist at Banco
BNP Paribas Brasil in Sao Paulo. “The risk-off scenario should
allow central banks to adopt more relaxed monetary stances,
which will let bond rates go down.”  The sol was little changed at 2.7312 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7310 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
