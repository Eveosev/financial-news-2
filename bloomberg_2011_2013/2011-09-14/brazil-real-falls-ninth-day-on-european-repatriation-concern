Brazil ’s real fell for a ninth day,
the longest losing streak since 2005, prompting the central bank
to refrain from selling dollars for the first time since
December 2010.  The real fell 0.3 percent to 1.7144 per dollar, from 1.7099
yesterday. The currency has lost 7.3 percent this month and
earlier tumbled to 1.7389, the weakest level since Nov. 23. The
real fell 0.8 percent versus the euro and touched a four-month
low of 2.3754 per euro.  Brazil’s government is concerned European companies may
take money out of the country as the economic crisis worsens in
the region,  Valor Economico  reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  “Repatriation is occurring, but the markets expect more,”
Italo Abucater, head of ICAP’s currency trading in Brazil, said
in a telephone interview from  Sao Paulo .  Most yields on interest-rate futures contracts rose as
concern the central bank may fail to tame inflation outweighed
signs the global economy is slowing.  Yields on interest rate futures contracts due in January
2013, the most actively-traded today in Sao Paulo, rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.78 percent. The
contract due in January 2014 rose 12 basis points to 11.06
percent.  Brazil is entering a more “delicate period” for seasonal
inflation, said  Zeina Latif , an economist at RBS Securities Inc.
in Sao Paulo.  ‘Fear’  “The fear remains that the implications for inflation will
be made stronger by the fact that we have a heated economy,
principally in the labor market,” Latif said in a telephone
interview. “Even though commodity prices are behaving, it’s
hard to imagine that inflation will be very low.”  Consumer prices rose 7.23 percent in the year through
August, exceeding the 6.5 percent upper limit of the central
bank’s target range for a fifth straight month. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Brazil’s economy created 190,446 government-registered jobs
in August, the Labor Ministry said today. The gain compares with
a forecast of 200,000 jobs, according to the median estimate
from seven economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
