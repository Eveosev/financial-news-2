York City , where he will participate in a moderated question and
answer session at the “Delivering Alpha” conference produced
by CNBC and Institutional Investor. Secretary Geithner will
discuss the President’s American Jobs Act, emphasizing the need
for Congress to move with speed pass the package and put more
people back to work and more money in the pockets of working
Americans, while not adding a dime to the deficit.  Also in the morning, Deputy Secretary Wolin will attend the
Vice President’s Cabinet meeting to discuss the latest efforts
to cut waste, fraud, and abuse as part of the Administration’s
