Cash levels for U.S. companies are
losing their meaning for the country’s economy because so much
of the money is held elsewhere these days, according to Dane Mott, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst.  Mott drew his conclusion from a review of 258 companies
that disclose cash and securities holdings outside their home
country. The total amount was equivalent to 50 percent of these
companies’ overall balances, he wrote two days ago in a report.
Apple Inc. had the most outside the U.S. at $47.6 billion.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how the percentage of Apple’s
cash held internationally has risen since 2007, when the maker
of iPhones and iPad tablet computers started to include balance
amounts in quarterly reports.  Apple, based in Cupertino,  California , has kept a majority
of its cash and securities outside the U.S. for the last eight
quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As of June
25, the proportion stood at 62.5 percent.  “It is increasingly difficult to consider corporate cash
levels to be any kind of specific indicator about the health of
the U.S. economy,” Mott, who is based in  San Francisco , wrote
in the note. They appear to have “more to do with global
economic performance.”  The 258 companies studied had a total of $368 billion in
non-U.S. cash balances.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  was second to Apple at
$45 billion, followed by  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  at $38.8 billion and
Oracle Corp. at $20.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
