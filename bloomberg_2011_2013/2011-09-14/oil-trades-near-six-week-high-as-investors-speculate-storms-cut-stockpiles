Oil traded near a six-week high in
 New York  as investors bet that storms in the Gulf of Mexico cut
supplies in the U.S., the worldâ€™s biggest crude consumer.  Futures climbed as much as 4 cents to $90.25 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after
earlier declining as much as 40 cents. Crude for October
delivery yesterday advanced $2.02 to $90.21, the highest close
since Aug. 3.  U.S. stockpiles fell 5.05 million barrels last week, the
industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported yesterday.
An Energy Department report today is forecast to show they
declined 3 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg survey of
analysts.  More than half of Gulf of Mexico oil production was shut
because of Tropical Storm Lee during the period. Tropical Storm
Maria yesterday gained speed as it traveled north across
Atlantic waters, prompting Bermuda to issue a warning, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
