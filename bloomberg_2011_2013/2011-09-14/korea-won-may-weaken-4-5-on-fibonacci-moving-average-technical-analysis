South Korea’s won may weaken 4.5
percent against the dollar by the end of next month after it
fell below key technical levels, according to Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co.  The won dropped below its 200-day moving average in onshore
trading today, breaching a key level in a series of numbers
known as the Fibonacci sequence by erasing 50 percent of its
gain from this year’s low of 1,144 reached March 17 to the 2011
high of 1,048.30 set on July 27. The Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback’s performance against those of six major trading
partners, broke above its 200-day moving average last week, a
bullish sign for the greenback.  “The trend seems to have turned around for the dollar’s
appreciation against the won and across the board,” said  Minoru Shioiri , chief manager of foreign-exchange trading at Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in  Tokyo . “The 200-day moving
average is quite an important technical indicator that many
market players watch.”  The won slumped 1.5 percent from last week’s closing level
to 1,092.68 per dollar as of 9:36 a.m. in  Seoul , touching a low
of 1,101.53, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 200-
day moving average is at 1,096.14 today and a 50 percent
retracement on the Fibonacci is 1,096.15.  The currency may revisit its 2011 low of 1,144 by the end
of October, Shioiri said. Onshore financial markets were closed
the last two days for a holiday.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Other Fibonacci levels are 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent, 61.8
percent and 76.4 percent. In technical analysis, investors and
