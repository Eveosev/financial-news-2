Indian equities reversed early
losses, helping the benchmark index post its biggest gain in
more than two weeks, as software makers rallied on speculation
the rupee’s depreciation will make them more competitive.  Infosys Ltd.,  India ’s second-largest software-services
provider, paced gains among peers, surging 6.1 percent, the
steepest climb since May 2009. India’s rupee fell past 48 per
dollar for the first time since September 2009 amid concern
overseas funds will pare holdings of emerging-market assets as
 Europe ’s debt crisis worsens.  Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JPA) , a
builder of dams, jumped 6.9 percent, ending four days of losses.  The BSE India Sensitive Index rose 282.42, or 1.7 percent,
to 16,749.86, according to preliminary closing prices as of 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai, its first gain in four days. The S&P CNX Nifty
Index on the National Stock Exchange jumped 1.5 percent to
5,012.55. The BSE-200 Index gained 1.4 percent to 2,070.10.  Overseas investors sold a net 7.8 billion rupees ($163
million) of equities on Sept. 12, reducing their investment in
equities this year to 19.1 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the regulator. They withdrew a net $2.4 billion
in August, the most since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
