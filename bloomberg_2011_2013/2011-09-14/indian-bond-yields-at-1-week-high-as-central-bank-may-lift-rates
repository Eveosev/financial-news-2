India’s 10-year bond yields were at
the highest level in more than a week on speculation gains in
consumer prices will prompt the central bank to boost borrowing
costs for a sixth time this year.  The benchmark wholesale-price index rose 9.78 percent in
August from a year earlier after a 9.22 percent jump in July,
the commerce ministry said today. Inflation has stayed above 9
percent from December. The depreciation of the rupee, Asia’s
worst-performing currency this year, may make commodity imports
costlier and pressure domestic prices, said K. Ramanathan, chief
investment officer, at ING Investment Management Pvt. in Mumbai.  “We can expect more monetary policy tightening,”
Ramanathan said. “Curbing inflation continues to be the central
bank’s top priority.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.35 percent at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That was the highest level since Sept. 2.  The rupee weakened beyond 48 to the dollar today for the
first time since September 2009, and closed at 47.6575, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Reserve Bank of India may increase the repurchase rate
by 25 basis points to 8.25 percent on Sept. 16, according to 12
of 13 economists in a Bloomberg survey. One expects no change.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose four basis points to 7.68 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
