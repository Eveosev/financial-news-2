Investors should buy the lira for
an equally-weighted basket of the dollar and euro as concern
about the current account deficit is easing, Credit Suisse Group
AG said.  Credit Suisse set a target of 2 liras against the basket
with a “stop-loss” of 2.17, according to an e-mailed report
today.  “A large part of the underperformance of the lira this
year has been due to investor skepticism about the central
bank’s policy mix,” Credit Suisse said in a report dated
yesterday. “With signs now appearing that the demand side of
the economy is rebalancing, we think that the lira will
strengthen from here.”  The lira fell 0.3 percent to 2.0977 against the basket at
10:33 a.m. in Istanbul, paring two days of gains. It closed at a
record low of 2.1786 on Aug. 22. The lira has fallen 22
percent against the basket over the past year, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
