The ruble headed for its lowest
level against the dollar in more than eight months after oil,
Russia’s chief export, dropped from a six-week high. The
currency kept declines after Bank Rossii left its benchmark rate
unchanged.  Russia’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 30.3401
against the dollar by 12:50 p.m. in Moscow. A close at that
level would be the weakest against the greenback since Jan. 11.
The ruble slid 0.2 percent against the euro to 41.4270.  Crude oil for October delivery dropped as much as $1.68 to
$88.53 a barrel in  New York , retreating from a six-week high as
investors bet gains were overdone on concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis will hobble the global economy. Bank Rossii left its
refinancing rate unchanged for a fourth month at 8.25 percent
today, as expected by all 23 economists in a Bloomberg survey,
while narrowing the difference between its deposit and lending
rates.  The ruble’s moves against the dollar and the euro pushed
the currency down 0.3 percent to 35.3292, the weakest since Aug.
10 based on closing prices, against the central bank’s target
currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters. The basket is calculated by multiplying the
dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by
0.45, then adding them together.  Investors increased bets the ruble will weaken further with
non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 30.7242 per
dollar in three months. The contracts provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements and interest-rate
differentials and allow companies to hedge against currency
swings.  Ruble Bond Sale  Russia ’s ruble bonds due August 2016 were little changed,
with the yield up one basis point at 7.58 percent. The country’s
ruble Eurobond also fell, pushing the yield two basis points
higher to 6.993 percent.  The Finance ministry sold 4.6 billion rubles ($321 million)
of government domestic bonds due April 2021 at the upper end of
its yield guidance in an auction today, according to a statement
by the ministry after the central bank’s rate decision.  The government cut the amount on offer earlier this week
from 35 billion rubles to 10 billion rubles and set the yield
guidance at 8 percent to 8.1 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
