unit.  The stock added 2.5 percent to 26.55 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its strongest since Aug. 17.  Net income at Russian billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov â€™s
investment company rose to $332 million, the Moscow-based
company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
