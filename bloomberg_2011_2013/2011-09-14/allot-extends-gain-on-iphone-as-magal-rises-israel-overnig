Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) , the
biggest gainer among Israeli companies traded in the U.S. over
the past year, is weathering a global economic slump as soaring
sales of iPhones and iPads boost demand for the company’s data
traffic equipment, Chief Executive Officer Rami Hadar said.  “As long as people continue to innovate with applications
and devices like iPhones and iPads then Allot should be OK,”
Hadar said in a phone interview from the company’s headquarters
in Hod Hasharon, Israel. “So far so good. We’re not feeling any
slowdown in our business.”  Shares of Israel’s largest maker of high-speed networking
equipment climbed 5.9 percent to $12.21 on the  Nasdaq  Stock
Market yesterday, increasing the 12-month gain to 126 percent,
the biggest on the Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index of the largest
Israeli companies traded in  New York . The gauge advanced 1.7
percent to 82.44, led by  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) , the 12-
year-old Israeli adapter maker part-owned by Oracle Corp.  Soaring Internet traffic and increased online video
streaming are driving demand for wireless-networking equipment
that can process the data.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  said iPhone sales rose 142
percent from a year earlier in the quarter ended June 25, while
the number of iPads sold climbed 183 percent. Allot sales rose
to a record $18.5 million in the second quarter from $13.6
million a year earlier, a 13th consecutive quarterly increase.  “The mobile market is the biggest growth engine for us,”
Hadar said. “We’re enjoying the phenomenal growth of
applications and new devices, which is really driving the need
for our equipment.”  Alcatel-Lucent  Hadar, 48, previously headed Native Networks, an Israeli
maker of ethernet networking technology that was sold in 2005
for $55 million in cash to  France ’s largest supplier of
telecommunications equipment, known today as Alcatel-Lucent SA.  Israel, whose population of 7.7 million is similar to
 Switzerland ’s, has 57 companies traded on the Nasdaq, the most
of any country outside the U.S. after  China . It is also home to
the largest number of startup companies per capita in the world.  Allot, whose customers include U.K.’s second-largest pay-
television company  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)  and billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s fixed-line carrier, Telefonos de Mexico SAB, developed a
technology that allows internet providers to differentiate
network traffic and provide tailored plans to their clients as
demand for faster data soars.  U.S. Internet users engaged in a record 6.9 billion online
video viewing sessions in July, according to Reston, Virginia-
based industry researcher ComScore. About 86 percent of U.S. Web
users viewed online video that month, ComScore’s data show.  Allot Performance  Allot shares have outperformed competitors, including
Fremont, California-based  Procera Networks Inc. (PKT) ’s 54 percent
gain over the past 12 months and Waterloo, Ontario-based
 Sandvine Corp. (SVC) ’s 7 percent retreat.  The company’s stock gain has pushed valuations to 23.8
times 2012 estimated earnings, more than double the  Nasdaq
Composite Index (CCMP) ’s 11.3 level and 7.9 for the Bloomberg Israel-US
25 Index.  Shares of Allot have dropped 36 percent in New York since
reaching a record level of $19.05 on July 19, as concern the
global economy is slipping back into a recession amid a
worsening European-debt crisis triggered a 19 percent plunge in
the Nasdaq Composite Index from April 29 to Aug. 19.  The company’s Aug. 1 announcement of a secondary offering
also pushed shares lower. Allot has postponed the plans to sell
stock since then because of the drop in global equities.  “We decided to pull back given the negative market
conditions,” Hadar said. “We’ll see when and where it would
make sense to come back.”  TA-25 Gains  Allot, which listed shares on the  Tel Aviv  Stock Exchange
on Dec. 22, rose 5.5 percent to 45.70 shekels, or the equivalent
of $12.45, as of the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv today.  Israel ’s benchmark TA-25 Index increased for a third day,
jumping 2 percent to 1,056.83, trimming the decline for the week
to 0.6 percent. The Israeli stock market was upgraded to
developed market status by MSCI Inc. in May 2010, the same month
the 63-year-old country was accepted to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.  The shekel strengthened 1 percent to 3.6719 per  U.S.
dollar , paring the decline over the past month to 3.8 percent.  Current-Account Deficit  Israel posted its first quarterly current-account deficit
since 2008 in the second quarter as export growth eased amid an
economic slowdown in the country’s main export markets. The
seasonally adjusted deficit was $560 million, compared with a
revised surplus of $362 million in the previous three months,
the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said yesterday.  Israeli technology companies raised $569 million in capital
during the second quarter of 2011, the most in two years and up
from $343 million in the same period last year, according to the
Israel Venture Capital-KPMG Quarterly Survey released July 13.  Mellanox jumped 6.2 percent to $35.12 yesterday, the
highest level since the company listed shares on the Nasdaq on
February 2007. The Tel Aviv shares advanced 7.1 percent to 133
shekels, or the equivalent of $36.22 today. The $1.65 premium
for the New York shares yesterday was the biggest for the
largest Israeli companies traded in the U.S.  Magal Security Systems Ltd. (MAGS)  declined to the lowest level
since December 1999, dropping 5.2 percent to $2.20. The Tel Aviv
shares, which sank 11 percent yesterday, climbed 7 percent to
8.196 shekels, or the equivalent of $2.23, today. The maker of
computerized security systems will delist from the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange on Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
