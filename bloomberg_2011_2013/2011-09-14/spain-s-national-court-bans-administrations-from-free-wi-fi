Spanish local authorities must pay
and register as internet providers to offer Wi-Fi services in
public buildings, the National Court said.  Local administrations will have to pay a fee to the
Telecommunications Market Commission to provide the service as
other operators such as  Telefonica SA (TEF) , the court said in an e-
mailed statement today. The service will only be free for
specific institutions and for internal use, including libraries
or cultural centres, it said.  The court upheld a 300,000-euro ($411,000) fine to the town
hall of Malaga imposed by the commission because it allowed
citizens to have free Wi-Fi access without notifying regulators,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
