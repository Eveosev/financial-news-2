Slovak Premier  Iveta Radicova 
survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote initiated by the
opposition, which claimed she failed to ensure transparent
procurement processes and that her policies are making citizens
poorer.  Lawmakers today in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, voted
78-69 against the first attempt to oust her since her government
took power after elections in June 2010. The proposal was
sponsored by Smer, the largest opposition party, led by
Radicovaâ€™s predecessor  Robert Fico .  The 14 month-old ruling coalition is struggling to maintain
popularity at a time when budget-deficit cuts and an economic
slowdown are hitting the population in the eastern euro-region
country. Even as tensions within the four ruling parties grow,
all coalition deputies present in the chamber supported the
prime minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
