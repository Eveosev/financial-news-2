Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said it would make no sense for the French government to
nationalize the country’s three top lenders after their share
prices plunged and two of them had their credit ratings cut.  Moody’s Investors Service lowered  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA’s
debt and deposit ratings by one level today to Aa3 from Aa2 with
a negative outlook and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ’s long-term ratings to
Aa2 from Aa1.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA’s Aa2 long-term rating was kept on
review for a possible cut.  “It’s relatively good news,” Noyer said on RTL radio in
Paris. “It was a limited downgrade. It was two banks out of
three. All Moody’s has done is put them on the same level as
other rating agencies and at the same level as other major
European banks.”  The three banks’ share prices have dropped this month on
concern that money-market funds are becoming reluctant to lend
to them because of their exposure to  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis.  “They don’t need fresh funds, though like all banks they
need to accumulate capital to have the best possible defenses,”
Noyer said. Nationalization “is something that makes no sense.
It’s totally surreal.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
