Corn fell, extending its biggest
slump in a week, as the U.S. crop improves and soybeans dropped
for a third day after the Department of Agriculture’s global
supply-and-demand report showed rising inventories.  The U.S. corn crop, the world’s biggest, was rated 53
percent good or excellent as of Sept. 11, up from 52 percent the
prior week, USDA data show. World soybean inventories before
next year’s harvest will reach 62.55 million metric tons,
compared with 60.95 million estimated in August and 68.82
million this year, the USDA said on Sept. 12.  “The market is still digesting Monday’s WASDE, plus
improved crop conditions, and ongoing macro uncertainty,”
Rabobank International analyst Erin FitzPatrick wrote in an e-
mail today, referring to the World Agricultural Supply and
Demand Estimates report of USDA supply and demand forecasts.
“Everyone is trying to figure out how much demand is slowing.”  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 5.5 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $7.175 a bushel by 12:04 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices fell 3 percent yesterday, the
most since Sept. 1.  Soybeans for November delivery dropped 3.75 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $13.88 a bushel and earlier touched $13.7725, the
lowest since Aug. 22. The oilseed declined 1.3 percent last
week.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will hold a
conference call with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy today on developments in the euro area
amid increasing speculation that  Greece  may default. U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  will urge European
governments to step up their crisis-fighting efforts when he
meets finance ministers this week, a euro-area official said.  ‘Seeking Direction’  “The market appears to be seeking direction, with  Europe ’s
sovereign issues weighing on market mentality,”  Luke Mathews , a
strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , wrote in a report.
Corn crops in the U.S., the biggest exporter, may escape the
worst of the damage from frost forecast in the Midwest, he said.  Wheat for December delivery gained 4.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $7.0675 a bushel, reversing earlier losses. Prices
fell 3.5 percent yesterday, the biggest drop since Sept. 1.
November-delivery milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris
declined 0.3 percent to 202.75 euros ($278) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
