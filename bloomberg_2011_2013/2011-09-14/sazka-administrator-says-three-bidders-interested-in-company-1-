Sazka AS’s administrator said there
are three bidders for the Czech bankrupt lottery company.  All three complied with conditions approved by a Prague
court and deposited 500,000 koruna ($27,913) into a bank
account, the administrator said today in an e-mailed statement.  The bidders are obliged to file binding bids by Sept. 23
and have to deposit the full bid amount into a bank, the
statement said. It didn’t give the names of the bidders.  Czech financial groups PPF AS and KKCG filed their bids in
a joint group, KKCG’s spokesman Daniel Plovajko said by phone.  Synot Holding, a Czech gaming operator, also bid for Sazka,
spokeswoman Magda Pekarova said. Synot postponed the start of
its own lottery planned for this month and will re-evaluate the
project once a new owner for Sazka is chosen, Pekarova said.  Charlcoal, a Cyprus-registered company that is linked with
a Czech financier Pavel Tykac, is the third bidder for Sazka,
iHned reported, without saying where it got the information.
Tykac would participate in providing finance to the company in
case it wins the tender, Tykac’s spokesman Jan Chudomel told
iHned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
