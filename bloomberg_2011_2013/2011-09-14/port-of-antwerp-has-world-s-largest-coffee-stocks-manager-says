The port of Antwerp has the largest
stockpiles of coffee in the world, Wim Dillen, senior business
development manager at the port, said at a coffee conference in
the Belgian city.  Bean inventories at the port’s warehouses increased to more
than 7 million bags at the end of July, up from just under 6
million bags at the end of April, Dillen said, in an interview
at the two-day conference which ends today.  “That’s at least five times higher than in Hamburg,”
Dillen said, commenting on the stockpiles. “We can still store
an additional 2.5 million bags.”  The port has 1 million square meters (10.8 million square
feet) of space to store soft commodities such as coffee and
cocoa. More than 2.8 million bags of coffee were imported into
the European Union last year, with  Belgium  being the third-
largest importer after Germany and  Italy , Dillen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
