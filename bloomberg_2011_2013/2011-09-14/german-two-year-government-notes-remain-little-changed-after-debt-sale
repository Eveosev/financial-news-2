German two-year government notes
stayed little changed after the nation sold 4.125 billion euros
($5.6 billion) of the securities.  The yield was one basis point higher at 0.51 percent as of
10:10 a.m. in  London .  The 0.75 percent notes maturing in September 2013 were sold
at an average yield of 0.51 percent, and received bids worth 1.8
times the securities offered, up from 1.4 at the last sale on
August 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
