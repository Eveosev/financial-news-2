Argentine central bank workers who
are holding a three-day strike that ends tomorrow said they will
repeat the protest next week if their demands for higher
pensions and more hiring of contractors aren’t met.  Most of the banks’ daily functions have been hampered by
the strike, including operations in the foreign exchange market,
as over 90 percent of workers are taking part, said Carlos Pellegrini, secretary-general of the workers’ union. A central
bank official, who asked not to be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak publicly, said the bank took measures to
avoid any interruption of services and is operating normally.  “There isn’t any money leaving or coming into the central
bank,” Pellegrini said in an interview today at his office in
downtown  Buenos Aires .  The union is asking for pension raises for retired
employees and for the bank to grant contracts to third-party
employees. The bank’s 2,500 workers also want to be compensated
for an income tax that makes their salary lower than employees
at other banks, Pellegrini said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
