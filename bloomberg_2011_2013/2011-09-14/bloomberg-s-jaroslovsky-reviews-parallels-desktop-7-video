Bloomberg's Rich Jaroslovsky 
reviews Parallels Desktop 7, the latest version of Parallels 
Inc.'s Windows-in-a-Mac software.  The program, which costs $80, allows Windows and Mac 
operating systems to co-exist, letting users switch between them
seamlessly. Users can also choose a mode called Coherence that 
hides Windows, making PC programs feel and behave almost like 
native Mac applications. (Rich Jaroslovsky is a Bloomberg News
