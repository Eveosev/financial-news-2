Germany ’s economy will grow less
than 3 percent this year and expand only around 1 percent in
2012 as demand for German exports slumps, the RWI economic
institute and the BDB association of German banks said.  Europe’s biggest economy will grow 2.9 percent this year,
according to the RWI. The BDB, which represents lenders
including Deutsche Bank AG, estimated growth of 2.8 percent. The
expansion will cool to 1 percent next year, said the RWI,
whereas the BDB forecast a slowdown to 1.1 percent.  “International conditions have clearly worsened,” the RWI
said today in an e-mailed statement. “Foreign trade will hardly
make a contribution at all in 2012 to German growth.”  Germany’s expansion is slowing as  Europe ’s debt crisis
prompts governments from  Spain  to Ireland to cut spending,
sapping export demand. Factory orders from abroad dropped in
July and executives and investors grew more pessimistic last
month.  German economic growth weakened to 0.1 percent in the
second quarter from 1.3 percent in the previous three months as
imports exceeded exports and consumers cut spending. In the 17-
member euro region, the expansion slowed to 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
