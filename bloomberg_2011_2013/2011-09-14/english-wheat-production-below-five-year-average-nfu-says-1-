English wheat production will be
lower than the five-year average because yields were hurt by dry
weather from April, the National Farmers Union said.  The harvest will total 13.6 million metric tons, 1.5
percent below the five-year average, the union said in a report
today. The area sown with wheat rose about 3 percent to 1.82
million hectares (4.5 million acres).  “This year’s yield decrease was largely due to tough
growing conditions last spring, including one of the lowest ever
rainfall levels recorded for the first half,” Ian Backhouse,
combinable crops chairman at the NFU, wrote in the report.  Feed-wheat futures fell 0.3 percent to 164.75 pounds
($260.19) a ton on the NYSE Liffe exchange in  London . Prices
declined 17 percent this year as  Russia  lifted an almost year-
long grain export ban in July.  Late-summer rains hindered harvesting and curbed yields and
quality, according to the report.  “Towards the latter part of harvest there was more
variability in quality with summer rains preventing many farmers
keeping up with ripening crops,” Backhouse said in the report.
“Fortunately, much of the quality milling crop was already
harvested and dried before exposure to prolonged rainfall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
