Romania  may give about 75 million
free carbon permits to energy producers in the seven years
starting in 2013, with oil company  OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  and two state-
owned power plants poised to get almost half of the allowances.  The country’s Economy Ministry will apply to the European
Union regulators for the free permits before the Sept. 30
deadline, according to an e-mailed response to questions from
Bloomberg. It has already started public consultations on the
proposal to allocate the allowances valued at 894 million euros
($1.2 billion) at today’s prices, it said.  “Romania’s energy sector is benefiting from this waiver as
power generators will be able to invest in upgrading the sector
infrastructure instead of paying for the permits,” the ministry
said in the statement.  Eastern and central European nations, including the  Czech
Republic , Poland and Romania, won an exemption in 2008 from an
EU requirement that  power plants  purchase all their CO2 permits
in the next phase of the bloc’s cap-and-trade program, the
world’s largest.  The EU opt-out allows utilities to get for free in 2013
allowances corresponding to 70 percent of their average annual
emissions for the period 2005 to 2007 with relation to national
electricity production and consumption data. The number will
decrease gradually each year and in 2020 power plants will have
to buy all their permits at auction or in the market.  Romania’s largest oil company OMV Petrom, a unit of
 Austria ’s OMV AG, will get 10.3 million free permits for its new
Brazi gas-fired power plant from 2013 through 2019, according to
the ministry. State-run coal-fed power plants Turceni and
Rovinari will get 11.8 million and 11.6 million permits,
respectively, for the seven years through 2019.  To contact the reporter on this story:
