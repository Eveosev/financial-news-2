Pacnet Ltd., an operator of
undersea phone and Internet cables in  Asia , said it could spend
$100 million to $500 million on acquisitions in Asia as it
considers a listing in the next two years.  The acquisition outlook hasn’t been affected by the market
slowdown because valuations are lower, Chief Executive Officer
Bill Barney said at a media briefing in  Singapore  today. The
company, which is based in both  Hong Kong  and Singapore, expects
to trade its shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market if it proceeds
with an initial stock sale, he said.  Pacnet had “very strong growth prospects over the last 10
years, and going forward for the next 10 years,” Barney said on
the appeal of the company to investors. “It’ll be a good public
investment for people, but we have to wait for the market window
to do that.”  The company is spending as much as $15 million on a new
content delivery network service over the next five years, and
expects 15 percent of its revenue to come from this service over
the same period, he said.  Barney also said Pacnet doesn’t plan to bid for  Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Plc (CW/) ’s assets because of the price. The
Financial Times reported June 19 that Cable and Wireless
Worldwide was considering selling most of its international
assets, citing people familiar with the matter. Pacnet made an
informal offer of $500 million for C&W’s overseas businesses,
the newspaper said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
