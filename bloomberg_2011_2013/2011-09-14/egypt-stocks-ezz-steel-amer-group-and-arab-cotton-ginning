Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
slumped 1.2 percent to 4,485.04, the lowest level since Aug. 9,
at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo.  The following shares rose or fell. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Amer Group Holding (AMER EY), an Egyptian resorts and
restaurants developer and operator, retreated 1.6 percent to
1.24 Egyptian pounds, the lowest level in more than three weeks.
August tourist arrivals in the country were down 21 percent from
a year earlier.  Arab Cotton Ginning (ACGC)   tumbled 5.2 percent, the most
in almost six months, to 3.81 pounds. The Cairo-based textiles
manufacturer cut its dividend to about one-fifth of last year’s
payout.  Ezz Steel (ESRS)   declined 2.3 percent to 8.23 pounds,
the lowest since Aug. 24.  Egypt ’s biggest manufacturer of the
metal had its share-price estimate cut 9 percent to 11 Egyptian
pounds at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE because of the Arab country’s
recent tax hike, higher labor costs and delays to the start of a
new plant. The investment bank’s recommendation on the stock was
maintained at “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
