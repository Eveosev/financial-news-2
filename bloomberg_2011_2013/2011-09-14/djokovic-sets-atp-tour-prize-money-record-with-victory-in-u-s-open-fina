Novak Djokovic  lifted his 2011
prize money to an ATP World Tour-record $10.6 million with his
victory two days ago in the U.S. Open tennis final.  The 24-year-old Serb, who’s ranked No. 1 in the world,
collected $1.8 million for beating 2010 champion  Rafael Nadal  in
the final and also secured a $500,000 bonus for finishing atop
the  U.S. Open Series  standings.  Djokovic also won the Australian Open and Wimbledon this
year and was a semifinalist at the  French Open , taking his 2011
earnings from the four Grand Slam events to $6.2 million.
Djokovic improved his match record this season to 64-2 with the
win over Nadal, which made him the sixth man to take three of
the four major titles in a calendar year.  “The amount of matches that I lost this year is just
incredible,” Djokovic told reporters at the National Tennis
Center in  New York  after the final. “It’s definitely going to
take a lot of effort to try to repeat even half of what I have
done this year for next year.”  Djokovic’s earnings in 2011 eclipse the previous record of
$10.2 million Nadal set last year. The Spaniard needed 17
tournaments to reach that amount, compared with 12 for Djokovic.
The only other player to earn $10 million in prize money in a
season was record 16-time major champion  Roger Federer , who made
$10.1 million from 16 tournaments in 2007.  Djokovic has won 10 tournaments in 2011, including a record
five ATP World Tour Masters titles.  The U.S. Open victory took his career earnings to $38.9
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
