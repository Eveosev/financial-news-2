The U.S. government’s effort to
collect data on antibiotic use in food animals is inadequate,
making it difficult to assess the risk that the additives will
create drug resistance in humans, according to the Government
Accountability Office.  Statistics gathered by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
and the Food and Drug Administration aren’t comprehensive enough
to understand the relationship between antibiotics use and any
decrease in their effectiveness, the GAO wrote in  a report 
released today. That makes it harder to determine whether
government efforts to limit their use are effective, the agency
said.  “Without detailed use data and representative resistance
data, agencies cannot examine trends,” the GAO said. The USDA
and Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the
FDA, support the findings, the GAO said. Calls and e-mails to
both agencies were not immediately returned.  Scientists have called for restrictions on the use of
antibiotics used to spur growth in animals. Widespread use of
the drugs from companies including  Bayer AG (BAYN) ,  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and
 Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  may increase the odds that undesirable
organisms will develop immunity to treatment, according to the
FDA. Drug-resistant infections have become increasingly common
in hospitals and schools, adding to health-care costs.  Large-scale livestock operations routinely administer
antibiotics to animals to promote growth and to prevent or treat
infections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
