Russian oil producer OAO Lukoil
tumbled in U.S. trading after the  International Energy Agency 
said the government may delay oil industry tax cuts to preserve
budget revenue ahead of elections.  American depositary receipts of Lukoil, Russia’s largest
independent oil producer, fell 1.4 percent to $56.94 in New
York, the lowest level since Aug. 22, after dropping 0.6 percent
to 1,710.60 rubles, the equivalent of $56.62, on the Moscow-
based Micex index. OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest natural gas
exporter, dropped for a fourth day in New York, losing 1.1
percent to $10.89, after sliding 1 percent on the Micex to
163.89 rubles, or $5.43. The Micex may fall 1 percent today,
according to  Alfa Bank . Stocks in  Asia  retreated.  Cuts to export duties on some oil products approved in
August by Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  may be postponed
as the government seeks to maintain a  budget surplus  in the run-
up to December’s parliamentary elections and the presidential
poll in March, the IEA said in an oil market report published
yesterday. Energy sales contribute as much as 40 percent of
Russian government revenue, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said
in June.  “If they repeal those tax breaks, that would be a further
negative for oil companies, which would probably diminish
production on a short-term basis,” Tom Furda, director of
Russian equity sales at Auerbach Grayson & Co.’s Moscow-based
brokerage partner UralSib Financial Corp., said in a phone
interview yesterday. “It’s classic electioneering to tax oil
companies. It helps your popularity when you tax  oil companies .
That’s a risk for the producers.”  U.S. Fuel Demand  The price of oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, snapped a
two-day advance in New York today, slipping as much as 0.4
percent to $89.81 a barrel in after-hours trading as investors
speculated rising gasoline stockpiles in the U.S. signal fuel
demand is faltering. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend,
fell 0.4 percent yesterday to $113.74.  United Co. Rusal, the largest maker of aluminum, climbed
2.6 percent to HK$8.02 in  Hong Kong  as of 9:58 a.m. local time.
Changes to  Guinea ’s mining laws mean investors will find it
“senseless” to agree on new projects for the country, Rusal
said yesterday.  Russia’s RTS futures rose, indicating the Moscow-based
index may climb for a third day. The contracts added 0.4 percent
to 158,0105 yesterday, while the RTS Index gained 0.3 percent to
1,572. The nation’s 30-stock  Micex index (INDEXCF)  also advanced 0.3
percent to 1,498.16.  Rising Volatility  Stocks in the U.S. were buoyed as French banks reassured
investors over their access to funding and  Germany ’s  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said  Greece  is taking the right steps to get its
next bailout payment. U.S. lenders  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Fifth
Third Bancorp (FITB)  led the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index up 0.9 percent
to 1,172.87.  The Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index of Russian companies
traded in New York fell for a fourth day, retreating 0.7 percent
to 278.0404. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the index futures, rose 2.5 percent to 46.87 points.  “Merkel’s comments may have helped to bring comfort,”
said  Ian McCall , managing partner at Quesnell Capital SA, an
emerging-markets investment advisory in Geneva that manages
about $114 million of assets. “But the overall market doesn’t
know where it’s going. There’s just a real lack of conviction.”  The Market Vectors  Russia  ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, retreated 0.7 percent to $31.05, while the
Bank of New York Mellon Russia ADR Index dropped 0.6 percent.  The Micex has lost 11 percent in 2011 and trades at 5.6
times analysts’ earnings estimates. That compares with a 20
percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa index, which trades at 9.5
times estimated earnings, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at 11.4 times
estimated earnings, and the BSE India Sensitive Index has a
ratio of 13.8.  The euro was recently little changed versus the dollar at
$1.3676 from $1.3678 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
