Ghana ’s economy may expand by 20
percent this year as the start of oil production for export,
along with high prices for cocoa and gold, boost revenue,
according to the  World Bank .  “First-quarter growth was 23 percent and oil, gold and
cocoa have since enjoyed very high prices on the international
market,” Dante Mossi, senior operations officer of the World
Bank’s office in the West African nation, said in an interview
in Accra, the capital, on Sept. 9. “The trend will follow.”  The Washington-based lender’s forecast is higher than its
earlier projection of 14 percent, which was made in June and was
in line with the Finance Ministry’s own 14.4 percent estimate
announced in July.  Ghana became Africa’s newest oil exporter in December, when
production began at the offshore Jubilee oil field, which is
operated by U.K.-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the explorer with the
most licenses in Africa. Gold reached a record $1,921.15 an
ounce on Sept. 6 amid uncertainty over the global economic
recovery and traded at $1,832.18 an ounce by 10:56 a.m. in
 London  today. Cocoa for December delivery rose for a second day,
adding 7 pounds ($11.05), or 0.4 percent, to 1,857 on the NYSE
Liffe in London.  Ghana is the world’s second biggest producer of cocoa after
Ivory Coast and trails  South Africa  as the continent’s top gold
miner.  Elections  More revenue coming into the state’s coffers within 15
months of presidential and parliamentary elections raises
concern about government spending, Mossi said. President John Atta Mills will face former Foreign Minister Nana Akufo-Addo,
whom he defeated in 2008, in the December 2012 vote.  “It will be sad if the government will collapse all the
sacrifices and strong economic confidence gained in four years,”
Mossi said.  Ghana’s fiscal deficit widened to 14.5 percent of gross
domestic product in 2008, “boosted by strong pre-election
spending growth” including gas-price subsidies, infrastructure
projects and wage increases for public workers, the
 International Monetary Fund   said  in July 2009.  The spending gap narrowed to 6.5 percent in 2010 before
Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  raised the target in July for
this year to 5.1 percent from an earlier forecast of 4.1 percent
amid plans for spending on roads, schools and agriculture.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
