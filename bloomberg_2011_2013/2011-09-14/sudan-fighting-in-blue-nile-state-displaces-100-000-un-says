Clashes between the Sudanese armed
forces and rebels in Blue Nile state are displacing tens of
thousands of people who can’t be reached by aid agencies due to
government restrictions on movement, the  United Nations  said.  The fighting started this month when Sudanese troops and
members of the northern branch of the ruling party in
neighboring South  Sudan  clashed in the Blue Nile state capital,
Al-Damazin. As many as 100,000 people have fled their homes, the
 UN News Centre  reported yesterday.  While the UN  World Food Programme  has received requests
from groups such as the Sudanese Red Crescent Society for aid,
“due to government-imposed restrictions on pre-positioning of
food stocks in Blue Nile, WFP has only enough stocks to feed
20,000 people for two weeks,” it said.  Sudan’s government has been trying to disarm fighters in
the border states of Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan who fought
during a two-decade civil war with the forces of South Sudan,
which gained independence on July 9. Clashes first erupted on
June 5 in Southern Kordofan, Sudan’s main oil-producing state,
forcing more than 150,000 people to flee their homes, according
to  Amnesty International  and  Human Rights Watch .  Sudanese army spokesman al-Swarmi Khaled didn’t answer two
calls to his phone seeking comment.  President Umar al-Bashir’s administration has fired the
governor of Blue Nile state and declared a state of emergency in
the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
