Gold will rise to $3,000 an ounce
by March of 2013, driven by  currency devaluation  and central
banks buying the metal, said John Brownlie, chief executive
officer of  Oro Mining Ltd. (OGR) , a company developing gold mines in
Mexico.  “People got over the sticker shock of paying $1,000,
people got over the sticker shock of $1,500,” Brownlie said in
an interview yesterday in New York. “Once they cross that $2,000
sticker shock, it can get significantly higher.”  Brownlie, who sold his last Mexican gold mine,  Capital Gold
Corp. (CGC) , to AuRico Gold Inc. for $338 million in April, said gold
will fall to $1,750 by the end of 2011. In his 30-year career,
Brownlie has developed mines in Mexico, South Africa and
Uzbekistan.  Oro Mining, which is based in Vancouver, will begin
production in 2013 with operating costs of $300 to $400 an
ounce, Brownlie said. Preliminary economic analysis and
feasibility studies will be completed by the end of this year,
he said.  Gold futures for December delivery gained $16.80, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $1,830.10 yesterday on the Comex in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
