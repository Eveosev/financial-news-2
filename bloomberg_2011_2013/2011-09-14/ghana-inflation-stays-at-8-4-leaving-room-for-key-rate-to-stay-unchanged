Ghana’s  inflation rate was
unchanged in August as better food harvests damped price
pressures, while electricity costs increased, giving the central
bank room to keep its key  interest rate  on hold.  Inflation stayed at 8.4 percent in July,  Grace Bediako , a
statistician at the  Ghana  Statistical Service, told reporters in
the capital, Accra, today.  “Ghana’s buffer-stock system and subsidized fertilizer for
farmers has reinforced the impact of the food harvest at this
time,” Sampson Akligoh, an economist at Accra-based Databank
Financial Services Ltd., said in a telephone interview
yesterday.  The  Bank of Ghana  left its key interest rate unchanged at
12.5 percent for the first time in three meetings, concerned
about rising electricity and water costs. The bank had lowered
the rate twice this year as inflation eased.  The bank may keep the policy rate on hold again at its next
decision meeting, as higher utility price and raises for public-
sector workers may add pressure on the inflation rate, Akligoh
said.  The state-owned National Food Buffer Stock Co. was created
last year to buy excess  crops  from farmers, while the government
said in July it would spend $22 million on fertilizer subsidies.  Ghana’s inflation rose to a five-year high of 20.7 percent
in June 2009 as food prices climbed and the cedi depreciated by
17 percent against the dollar. Prices eased over the next 18
months before a 30 percent increase in petroleum costs pushed
the rate to 9.2 percent in February from 9.1 percent a month
earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
