Fiat SpA (F) ’s Alfa Romeo division
won’t return to the U.S. before 2013 as the brand delays
introducing some models, including the 4C sports car that was
supposed to be its first vehicle on sale in the country.  Alfa postponed selling the 4C and an unnamed small sport-utility vehicle by a year, according to a presentation posted on
Fiat’s website. It also moved the debut of the Giulia sedan to
2014 and canceled plans for a bigger SUV, replacing the model
with a large four-wheel-drive sedan.  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said yesterday at
the International Motor Show in  Frankfurt  that Turin, Italy-based Fiat may delay model introductions globally as a result of
the deteriorating economy. Marchionne has a strategy of remaking
Alfa into a luxury brand taking on Bayerische Motoren Werke AG
with high-end compacts, sports cars and SUVs.  Marchionne said in an April interview that Alfa is
“critical” for the Fiat group and that he was planning the
brand’s return to the U.S. as early as next year. Alfa models
haven’t been sold in the U.S. since 1995.  The small Alfa SUV was scheduled to be built starting in
the fourth quarter of 2012 at Fiat’s Mirafiori plant in  Italy .
The Italian company announced a 1 billion-euro ($1.37 billion)
investment last November to convert the factory to make as many
as 280,000 SUVs a year for  Alfa Romeo  and the Jeep brand of
Fiat-controlled Chrysler Group LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
