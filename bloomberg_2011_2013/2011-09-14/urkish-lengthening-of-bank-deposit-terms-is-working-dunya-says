Turkish central bank measures to
lengthen average deposit terms at banks are succeeding, having
cut deposits held for less than a month by 54 percent in the
past seven months,  Dunya  reported.  The value of deposits held for less than a month fell by
34.4 billion liras ($19 billion) as “deposits began to slide
toward longer maturities in a definite way,” the newspaper
said, citing its calculations from regulatory data.  Most deposits in  Turkey  remain short-term, however, Dunya
said. At the end of July, 85 percent of total deposits, 90
percent of savings deposits and 81 percent of foreign exchange
deposits, were held for three months or less, it said.  The central bank imposed higher reserve requirements for
short-term deposits in December, to encourage longer-term
savings, Dunya said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
