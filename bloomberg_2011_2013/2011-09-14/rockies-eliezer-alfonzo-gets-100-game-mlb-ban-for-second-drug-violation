Colorado  Rockies catcher Eliezer Alfonzo was suspended for 100 games following a second positive
test for performance-enhancing drugs.  The suspension of Alfonzo, who is on the Rockies’ active
roster, is effective immediately,  Major League Baseball  said in
a news release.  Alfonzo, 32, was a San Francisco Giants minor-leaguer in
2008 when he became the first player to face a 50-game ban for a
positive test after the sport tightened its drug rules following
the release of the Mitchell report on doping in the sport.  “I am surprised by this positive test,” Alfonzo said in
an e-mailed statement today. “I learned my lesson in 2008 and
have not taken any prohibited substances since then. With the
union’s help, I intend to fight this suspension and look forward
to appearing before the arbitrator in the near future.”  Alfonzo played in 25 games for Colorado this season,
posting a .267 batting average with one home run and nine runs
batted in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
