GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA Chief Executive Officer
Gerard Mestrallet said long-term gas contracts are necessary,
though they must be adapted to reflect market conditions.  Some European nations have “unilaterally changed the rules

event in Paris today. “Breaches of contract are breaches of
confidence which may divert investment away from  Europe ,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
