Oil fell from the highest in six
weeks as investors speculated gains were exaggerated amid
concern that Europe’s debt crisis and the faltering U.S.
economic recovery will temper fuel demand.  Futures dropped as much as 1.9 percent after technical
indicators signaled gains of more than 3 percent in the past two
days may have been excessive. U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  will meet European finance ministers this week to
discuss efforts to contain the region’s sovereign-debt troubles.
The International Energy Agency yesterday cut its global oil-
consumption forecasts for this year and 2012.  “There is overall reduced demand as a consequence of
weaker than expected economic growth in the developed
economies,” Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets
in Sydney, said by telephone. “Growth in the big Western
economies is weaker than it was a few months ago and getting
weaker all the time.”  Crude for October delivery declined as much as $1.68 to
$88.53 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $88.81 at 2:47 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday rose $2.02 to $90.21, the highest since Aug.
3. Futures have lost 2.9 percent so far this year.  Brent oil for October settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange fell as much as 79 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $111.10 a barrel. The European benchmark contract
was at a premium of $22.53 to U.S. futures, down from a record
close of $26.66 on Sept. 6.  Technical Indicators  New York oil’s five-day stochastic oscillators climbed
above 80, signaling prices have increased too quickly, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures also stopped advancing
yesterday before the 50-day moving average, at $90.70 a barrel
today. A failure to breach technical resistance typically means
prices will change direction.  The Paris-based IEA reduced its estimate for oil demand
this year by 200,000 barrels a day and by 400,000 in 2012.
Worldwide consumption will rise 1.2 percent to 89.3 million
barrels a day this year and 1.6 percent to 90.7 million in 2012.
A full resumption of exports from  Libya  following the ouster of
 Muammar Qaddafi  will be “long and difficult,” said the energy-
security adviser to developed nations.  Geithner will meet European Union finance ministers in
Wroclaw,  Poland , on Sept. 16 and Sept. 17. It will be the first
time he attends a session of Europe’s Economic and Financial
Affairs Council, known as Ecofin.  U.S. Economy  “The market will focus on developments in the euro zone,
ongoing weakness in economic data, and the restart of production
in Libya,” Tom Pawlicki, a Chicago-based analyst at MF Global
Holdings Ltd., said in a note.  U.S. retail sales probably climbed 0.2 percent in August,
the slowest pace in three months, as job and income growth
weakened, according to the median estimate of 73 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before a Commerce Department report
today. The country is the world’s largest economy and oil user.  Gasoline inventories rose 2.76 million barrels in the week
ended Sept. 9, the industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute 
said yesterday. A median decline of 500,000 barrels is forecast
by 14 analysts in a Bloomberg News poll before an Energy
Department report today.  Crude stockpiles fell 5.05 million barrels, the API said.
The Energy Department report may show supplies dropped 3 million
barrels after Tropical Storm Lee shut output in the  Gulf of
Mexico , based on the Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
