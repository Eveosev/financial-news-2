Prices for 95-RON gasoline in  Asia 
fell after BP Plc sold a cargo. Hin Leong Trading Pte paid
premiums for gasoil cargoes in Singapore, the region’s biggest
oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  BP sold 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline to Royal Dutch
Shell Plc at $123.70 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window
today. That was lower than the $124.40 a barrel paid for a
similar cargo yesterday.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $116.16 a ton at 5:35 p.m. Singapore time from $109.78 at the
end of trading in Asia yesterday, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong purchased four cargoes of 0.5 percent sulfur
gasoil, or diesel, totaling 630,000 barrels, according to the
Bloomberg News survey. The  Singapore  trader paid Brightoil
Petroleum Holdings Ltd. 10 cents to 20 cents a barrel over
benchmark quotes for two cargoes and premiums of 20 cents to 30
cents to Shell for another two cargoes.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose $1.22 to
$18.23 a barrel at 2:35 p.m. Singapore time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, climbed the most since Aug. 11.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after advancing
to $2.05 a barrel, the highest since Aug. 31, PVM data showed.
An increasing regrade shows it is more profitable to produce
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil   Gunvor Group sold two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke
fuel oil to Hin Leong Trading at a premium of $1.50 a ton to
benchmark prices published by Platts in the remainder of
September. The privately owned Singapore trader also bought two
cargoes of the fuel from Brightoil at the same price.  Gunvor sold 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke fuel oil to Hin
Leong at a premium of $2 a ton over benchmark prices in the
remainder of September. Shell bought 20,000 tons from Gunvor at
a premium of $6.75 a ton over benchmark quotes for October.  Gunvor sold two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke fuel
oil to Hin Leong at a premium of $4.50 a ton to benchmark
prices. The company has sold at least seven cargoes of the fuel
this month on the window, according to Bloomberg tracking.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed $1.03, or 17
percent, to $5.03 a barrel at 2:35 p.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
