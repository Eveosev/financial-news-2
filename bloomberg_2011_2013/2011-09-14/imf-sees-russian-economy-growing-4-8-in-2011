The  International Monetary Fund 
said today it projects the Russian economy to grow 4.8 percent
in 2011.  “The muted outlook reflects expectations that the
combination of soaring oil prices and large capital
inflows—which, together with procyclical economic policies,
propelled credit and powered the boom in the run-up to the
crisis—is unlikely to return amid political uncertainty, a still
fragile banking system, and increased risk aversion by
investors. Inflation is projected to edge down to 8 percent by
end-2011, assuming food prices continue to moderate,” the IMF
said in a statement released by e-mail in Washington    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
