Mexico ’s peso fell to its weakest
level in more than a year, dropping to 13 per  U.S. dollar  for
the first time since last September, as investors shunned
emerging-market assets amid continued concern about  Europe ’s
debt crisis.  The peso declined 0.4 percent to 12.9332 per U.S. dollar at
5 p.m. New York time, from 12.8840 yesterday. The currency
declined as much as 1.1 percent to 13.0235 per U.S. dollar in
intraday trading, the weakest level since it touched 13.0584 on
Sept. 9, 2010. It last reached 13 per dollar on Sept. 10, 2010.
The peso has fallen 4.6 percent this year, the second-worst
performer among major Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg after  Argentina ’s peso.  Credit Agricole SA and Societe Generale SA, France’s
second- and third-largest banks, had their long-term credit
ratings cut one level by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited
the risks posed by their investments in  Greece . Investors are
looking to cut their investments in emerging markets because of
the European debt concerns, said Ram Bala Chandran, a Latin
America currency and rates strategist at Citigroup Inc.  “People are unwinding emerging-market risk,” Bala
Chandran said by phone from New York. “It’s the same story
everywhere.”  Nineteen of 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg fell against the U.S. dollar.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to
6.55 percent, according to data from Banco Santander SA. The
price of the security rose 0.81 centavo to 130.48 centavos per
peso.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. The bank has been
buying as much as $600 million through the options every month
since March 2010 to bolster foreign reserves. They allow the
central bank to accumulate dollars, insuring against outflows of
capital and limiting the peso’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
