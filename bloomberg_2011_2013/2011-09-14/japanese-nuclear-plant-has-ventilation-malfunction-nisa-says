A Japanese nuclear plant had a
malfunction in its ventilation system, the countryâ€™s atomic
regulator said. There was no radiation leakage outside the
reprocessing plant northeast of  Tokyo .  Three ventilation units failed to restart for about 20
minutes yesterday due to a timer malfunction, the Nuclear and
Industrial Safety Agency said in a  statement  today. The plant in
Tokai village in Ibaraki prefecture is operated by the Japan
Atomic Energy Agency.  The incident was rated 1, the lowest level, on the seven-
step International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, the
agency known as NISA said.  Tokai was the site of an incident in 1999, when workers at
a uranium processing plant started a chain reaction while
producing nuclear fuel. Two employees later died from  radiation
exposure  and the event was rated 4 on the INES scale.  The Fukushima accident north of Tokyo, where Tokyo Electric
Power Co. is still trying to contain radiation leaks after the
March earthquake and tsunami caused three meltdowns, is rated 7
on the INES scale.  An explosion and fire at a French nuclear-waste processing
site two days ago killed one person and injured four.  To contact the reporters on this story:
