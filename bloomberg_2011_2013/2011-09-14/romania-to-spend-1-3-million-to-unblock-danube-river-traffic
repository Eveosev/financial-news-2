Romania may spend about 4 million
lei ($1.3 million) to unblock traffic on the Danube River as
water levels have dropped in recent days, the  Transport Ministry 
said.  The ministry asked the government to approve the allocation
of funds to “remove the risk situation” from the Danube,
without elaborating on the procedures, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the Bucharest-based ministry. More than 250
ships are blocked in different ports, it said.  A lack of rain has reduced water levels to about 2,400
cubic meters a second, compared with the usual volume of 3,800
cubic meters at this time of year, according to the country’s
 water supervisory  agency. Water levels are expected to continue
to decline until Sept. 21, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
