Thai and Indonesian stock markets
are the farthest from 2008/9 lows, based on current price-to-
book, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  Thailand  traded at 2.24 times price-to-book and Indonesia
at 3.43 times as of Sept. 12, more than double their 2008/9
lows, Sakthi Siva and Kin Nang Chik, analysts at Credit Suisse,
wrote in a report dated yesterday. The stock markets closest to
their 2008/9 lows are Israel, Brazil, Egypt and MSCI  China , with
the latter being just 1 percent above its low in that period,
they wrote.  “Significantly, Europe’s price-to-book of 1.27 times is
still 14 percent above the 2008/09 lows of 1.11 times,” they
wrote.  Indonesia is the world’s fifth-best performer in the past
12 months, rising 20 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Thailand has rallied 12 percent in that time, while
the MSCI All-Country World Index of developed and emerging
nations has dropped 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
