Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest
U.S. gold producer, said the price of bullion may jump 36
percent to $2,500 an ounce by 2013.  “I don’t see the facts to cause the gold market to change
in at least five years,” Chief Executive Officer Richard O’Brien said in Dalian,  China  today. Gold may gain to more than
$2,000 in 2012 and stay high for the next five years, he said.  Bullion has extended its  bull market  into an 11th year, the
longest winning streak since at least 1920, and reached a record
$1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6 on demand from investors to
protect their wealth from weakening currencies as governments
print more money in an attempt to boost their economies.  “There’s going to be a lot of volatility, up, but
volatile,” O’Brien said in an interview. “We are going to
continue to see the support for gold in that $1,850 range and
above.” Cash gold traded at $1,833.82 an ounce today.  Gold is expected to reach highs “well above $2,000 in the
coming months on lower bond yields, expectations of poor risky
asset returns and volatility, growing European sovereign-debt
concerns and general  risk aversion ,” TD Securities analysts
including Bart Melek wrote in a report.  Bullion is up 29 percent this year, outperforming global
stocks, Treasuries and most commodities on demand for haven
assets and as central banks add to reserves for the first time
in a generation. Holdings in exchange-traded products reached a
record 2,216.756 metric tons on Aug. 8.  Newmont wants to invest in China and O’Brien said finding a
partner may take more than five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
