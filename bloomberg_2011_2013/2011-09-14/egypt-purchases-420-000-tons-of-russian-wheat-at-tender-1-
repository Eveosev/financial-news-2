Egypt, the worldâ€™s biggest wheat
importer, bought 420,000 metric tons of the grain grown in
 Russia  at a tender.  The state-run  General Authority  for Supply Commodities
purchased a 60,000-ton cargo from Allegrow at $277.77 a ton and
another of equal size from El Etihad at $278.44 a ton, Vice
Chairman Nomani Nomani said by telephone. It also bought four
60,000-ton cargoes from Louis Dreyfus at $278.44 a ton and a
seventh shipment of that size from Cargill at $278.95 a ton.  The wheat, which was purchased without the cost of freight,
