Andy Murray  appointed eight-time
Grand Slam tennis champion  Ivan Lendl  as his full-time coach.  Murray, ranked fourth by the ATP World Tour, will
immediately begin working with Lendl in preparation for next
month’s Australian Open. The Scot lost the 2011 final in
Melbourne to Novak Djokovic and made the semifinals of the other
three Grand Slam tournaments.  “Ivan’s impact on the game is unquestionable and he brings
experience and knowledge that few others have, particularly in
major tournaments,” Murray said on his website.  Lendl spent 270 weeks atop the world rankings and reached
19 major singles finals during his career.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
