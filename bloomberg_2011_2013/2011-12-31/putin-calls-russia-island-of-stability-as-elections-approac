Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said
 Russia ’s economy is an “island of stability” amid the
turbulence in the global markets and as he seeks another term as
president.  “The world’s economy hasn’t calmed from turbulence,”
Putin said in a New Year message broadcast on state television.
“In this sense Russia is notably an island of stability -- in
any case for now.”  Putin will seek to return to the Kremlin in March elections
after serving as prime minister following two terms as
president. He is also confronting the biggest anti-government
protests in more than a decade after alleged fraud in Dec. 4
parliamentary elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
