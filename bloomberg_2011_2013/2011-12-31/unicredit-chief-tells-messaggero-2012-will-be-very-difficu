UniCredit SpA (UCG)  Chief Executive
Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  said 2012 will be “very” difficult,
although the worst is over for  Italy  and for  Europe , Il
Messaggero reported, citing an interview.  Reforms to competition and privatization are vital for
Italy to recover, Ghizzoni told the newspaper. UniCredit will be
one of Europe’s most “solid” after its 7.5 billion-euro ($9.7
billion) capital increase next year, Ghizzoni told Il
Messaggero.  To contact the reporter on this story:
