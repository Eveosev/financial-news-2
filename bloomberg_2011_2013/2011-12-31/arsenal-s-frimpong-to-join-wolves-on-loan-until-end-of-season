Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong
will join Wolverhampton Wanderers on loan until the end of the
season, the Premier League club said on its website.  Frimpong, 18, came back from a knee injury which caused him
to miss most of last season to appear in 14 games for Arsenal
this campaign.  He’ll join Wolves tomorrow when the transfer period opens
in order “to gain valuable first-team experience to progress
his development,” Arsenal said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
