For the first time since at least
1997, the  bond market  produced the highest returns of any
financial asset, beating stocks, commodities and the dollar as
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis threatened the global economy.  Led by U.S. Treasuries, fixed-income securities worldwide
returned 5.89 percent, including reinvested interest, this year
through Dec. 30, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. The
Dollar Index tracking the U.S. currency against six peers rose
1.6 percent, while the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index
of commodities fell 1.18 percent and the  MSCI All Country World
Index (MXWD)  of shares tumbled 6.9 percent with dividends.  “The year was one of tremendous volatility, brought on by
increasing global and political economic uncertainties, which
drove investors massive flight to quality into bonds,”
 Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.9 billion as chief
investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New
York, said in a telephone interview on Dec. 27. “There has been
a general softening of expectations for growth and inflation
worldwide, and bonds have thrived.”  The  European Central Bank  and the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia 
led central banks that reduced  interest rates  as the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for global economic
growth to 4 percent for this year and next from prior estimates
of 4.3 percent for 2011 and 4.5 percent for 2012.  ‘Severe’ Repercussions  In downgrading its assessment of the global economy, the
IMF predicted in September “severe” repercussions if  Europe 
failed to contain a debt crisis that led to bailouts of Greece,
Ireland and Portugal, and threatened to engulf Italy and Spain.  “There is no economy in the world, whether low-income
countries, emerging markets, middle-income countries or super-
advanced economies that will be immune to the crisis that we see
not only unfolding, but escalating at a point where everybody
would actually have to focus on what it can do,”  Christine
Lagarde , managing director of the IMF, said on Dec. 15.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market Index,
which tracks more than 19,000 securities with a market value of
almost $42 trillion, posted its best year since gaining 8.92
percent in 2002.  The biggest beneficiary from the flight to safety was  U.S.
Treasuries , which gained 9.78 percent, the most since 2008 at
the height of the financial crisis. Treasuries due in 10 years
or more soared 29 percent, the most since gaining 30.7 percent
in 1995, even as S&P lowered the nation’s AAA credit rating one
level to AA+ on Aug. 5 Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch
Ratings affirmed their top ratings.  ‘Biggest Surprise’  “At this time last year if you asked people what the best
performing security class would be, not too many people would
have said Treasuries, but it’s turned out to be the biggest
surprise of the year,” Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about
$10 billion as co-head of government and mortgage-backed
securities at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh, said in a
telephone interview on Dec. 27.  U.K. bonds (UKGATR)  were the best performers among the 26 sovereign
markets tracked by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies, jumping 17 percent. They beat
German debt, considered the euro area’s safest securities, by
more than 7 percentage points, the most since 1998.  Government bonds  globally returned 6.1 percent on average,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Dollar Strength  Investment-grade corporate securities gained 5.16 percent,
while high-yield, high-risk, or junk, bonds returned 3.14
percent. Speculative-grade debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
and less than BBB- at S&P.  The rally in Treasuries bolstered the greenback, with U.S.
 Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses to track
the currency against the euro, yen, pound, Swiss franc, Canada
dollar and Swedish krona, rising 1.6 percent. That followed a
gain of 1.3 percent in 2010, marking the first time it advanced
two years in a row since 2000-2001.  Among the 16 most-widely traded currencies, the yen was the
only one to appreciate against the dollar, strengthening 5.4
percent. The biggest loser was South Africa’s rand, which
depreciated 18.1 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The euro weakened 3.3 percent against the dollar, and fell
below 100 yen for the first time since 2001. The 17-nation euro
was the worst performer among the 10 developed-nation exchange
rates tracked Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes,
losing 2.1 percent. The dollar advanced 1.1 percent on that
basis and the yen gained 5.5 percent.  ‘Big Question’  “The story of the year in  currency markets  has been the
euro-zone crisis, and it has permeated every other  capital
market ,” Boris Schlossberg, director of research at the online
currency trader GFT Forex in  New York , said in a telephone
interview on Dec. 29. “Geopolitical risk will make a push for
more volatility in the new year as whether the European Union as
we know it will survive is still a big question.”  Commodities, as measured by the S&P GSCI Total Return
Index, fell after gaining 9.02 in 2010 and 13.5 percent in 2009.  Copper slumped 21 percent this year, its first decline
since 2008, as Europe’s debt crisis escalated and demand in
 China  slowed. Cotton plunged 37 percent, its biggest loss since
2004.  “The market has come to the realization that there are,
indeed, a lot of problems in Europe, and they are not going
away, which could have knock-on effects for global growth,”
Jeffrey Sherman, a commodities investor who helps manage $21
billion for DoubleLine Capital LP in Los Angeles, said in a
telephone interview on Dec. 29.  Oil, Gold  Crude oil recorded its third straight gain, adding 8.2
percent to $98.89 a barrel in New York. Gold completed its 11th
consecutive increase, the longest winning streak in at least
nine decades. Bullion was at $1,564.20 an ounce in New York.  Two companies fell out of the list of the 10 biggest in the
world by market value in 2011 from a year ago. Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. dropped from 10 to 13 and China Mobile Ltd.
slipped to 11 from nine. They were replaced by International
Business Machines Corp., which jumped to six from 15, and Google
Inc., which climbed to ninth from 13. Exxon Mobil Corp. remained
the world’s biggest company while Apple Inc. jumped over
Petrochina Co. into second.  The  MSCI All Country World Index (MXWD)  of stocks retreated after
rallying 10.4 percent in 2010 and 31.5 percent in 2009. The MSCI
index is  valued (MXWD)  at 12.4 times reported profit, 24 percent below
the average from the past five years, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The  S&P 500  was little changed and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  climbed 5.5 percent. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow were
among the 10 best performers of the 91 national indexes tracked
by Bloomberg.  “Without a doubt, 2011 was the year of the coupon clipper
as yield became an increasingly important source of return for
both the bond and stock market,” said James Sarni, senior
managing partner at Los Angeles-based Payden & Rygel, which
manages $50 billion, in a telephone interview on Dec. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
