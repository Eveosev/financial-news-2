Treasuries (YCGT0025)  had the biggest annual
return since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 as
Europe’s debt turmoil spurred investor demand for refuge even as
 Standard & Poor’s  cut America’s credit rating.  U.S. 10-year note yields ended 2011 within a quarter-
percentage point of a record low while data showed the  U.S.
economy  was strengthening. U.S. payrolls increased in December,
a report next week is forecast to show. Treasuries were
supported by the  Federal Reserve , which pledged to hold its
benchmark  interest rate (FDTR)  near zero until mid-2013 and took
additional action to try to lower borrowing costs.  “There’s still a lot of fear in the market,” said  Anthony Cronin , a trader at Societe Generale SA in New York, one of the
21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “If a country like
 Italy  or  Spain  is unable to fund themselves, will the other
countries be able to pick up the slack? Will that cause a major
banking crisis?”  The benchmark  10-year note yield (USGG10YR)  closed at 1.88 percent
yesterday in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices, its lowest at year-end since at least 1963. It tumbled
142 basis points, or 1.42 percentage points, from Dec. 31, 2010,
in the biggest annual decrease since the 181 basis-point drop in
2008. The yield touched 1.67 percent on Sept. 23, a record low.  Thirty-year bond yields (USGG30YR)  dropped 144 basis points, also the
most in three years, to 2.89 percent. Two-year note yields fell
35 basis points to 0.24 percent, their lowest level at the end
of a year since at least 1977.  Annual Returns  Treasuries returned 9.6 percent in 2011 through Dec. 29,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, beating
stocks and commodities. Long bonds gained 35 percent, and 10-
year notes rose 17 percent. The  MSCI All Country World Index (MXWD)  of
equities lost 6.9 percent after accounting for reinvested
dividends, and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return  Index (SPGSCITR)  of
commodities declined 1.2 percent.  German bonds also gained 9.6 percent, according to the
Merrill Lynch indexes.  Treasuries climbed as Europe’s two-year-old debt crisis
persisted through summits and rescue efforts. The turmoil, which
led to bailouts of  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal , now threatens
Spain and Italy.  U.S. bonds extended gains yesterday as Spain’s government
moved to raise taxes and cut spending to tackle a larger-than-
forecast budget deficit. The country’s fiscal shortfall this
year will reach 8 percent of gross domestic product, spokeswoman
Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said at a press conference in  Madrid .  ‘More Foggy’  Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of
euro-area finance ministers, said economic growth in the 17-
nation currency region “isn’t good.”  “This means that in 2012 we have to be prepared for the
situation to become more foggy, to say it in a friendly way,”
Juncker said yesterday on RTL Luxembourg radio.  Concern  Europe ’s turmoil is worsening offset reports
showing the U.S. recovery is building momentum. Growth in the
world’s biggest economy will quicken to 2.1 percent in 2012 from
1.8 percent in 2011, a Bloomberg survey showed.  U.S. jobless-benefit applications over the past month fell
to a three-year low, data showed Dec. 29. The Institute for
Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its business barometer was
at 62.5 in December, compared with a Bloomberg poll forecast of
61. Readings above 50 signal growth.  Nonfarm Payrolls  Nonfarm payrolls added 150,000 jobs in December, after
gaining 120,000 in November, a Bloomberg News survey forecast
before the government reports the data on Jan. 6. The
unemployment rate was projected at 8.7 percent.  “On its own, rates would be significantly higher in the
U.S., but we are not an island unto ourselves,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in  New York  of government and agency
debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and
dealer for institutional investors. “The exogenous impact from
Europe is clearly keeping our rates much lower than they would
be otherwise.”  Treasury 10-year yields will advance to 2.66 percent by the
end of 2012, according to a Bloomberg survey with the most
recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  The government drew record demand at its bond auctions in
2011, even after S&P downgraded the U.S. to AA+ for the first
time from the top AAA level. The rating company criticized
federal lawmakers for failing to cut spending enough to reduce
 budget deficits (FDEBTY)  that exceed $1 trillion a year.  Most Since 1992  The Treasury Department attracted $3.04 for each dollar of
the $2.135 trillion in notes and bonds sold this year. It was
the most since the government began releasing the data in 1992
during the George H. W. Bush administration, and a sign that
President  Barack Obama  may have little difficulty financing a
fourth consecutive year of $1 trillion budget deficits.  The Fed completed in June a $600 billion program of buying
Treasuries to spur growth. It was the central bank’s second
round of asset purchases under quantitative easing.  In October, reacting to an  unemployment rate  that had been
near or above 9 percent since 2009, the Fed began a program to
lower borrowing costs by replacing $400 billion of shorter-term
assets in its holdings with longer-term debt.  The central bank said yesterday it will buy about $45
billion of Treasuries in January and sell about $44 billion as
part of the  program , known by traders as Operation Twist after a
similar effort in the 1960s.  U.S. government securities rose in December even as
Treasuries held in custody at the Fed for foreign central banks
and other official investors fell by $68.9 billion, the biggest
four-week drop on record, according to Fed data. The slide came
as the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six trade partners, rose 2.3 percent this month.  “It’s not unlikely they are repatriating assets to shore
up their own economies,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond
strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  To contact the reporter on this story:
