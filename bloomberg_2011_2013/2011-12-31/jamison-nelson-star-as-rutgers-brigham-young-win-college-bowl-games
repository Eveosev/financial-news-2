Rutgers University  running back
Jawan Jamison and Brigham Young University quarterback Riley
Nelson had multi-touchdown performances as their teams won
college football bowl games yesterday.  In other games, Vick Ballard scored two touchdowns in
Mississippi State’s 23-17 victory over Wake Forest in the Music
City Bowl, and Blake Bell ran for three touchdowns to lead the
University of  Oklahoma  to a 31-14 win over  Iowa  in the Insight
Bowl.  Jamison, a sophomore, rushed for 131 yards with two
touchdowns as the Scarlet Knights beat Iowa State 27-13 in the
second annual Pinstripe Bowl in Yankee Stadium. The Rutgers
defense forced three turnovers and held the Cyclones out of the
end zone for the first 50 minutes of the game en route to their
fifth consecutive bowl victory.  Nelson threw his third scoring pass to Cody Hoffman with 11
seconds remaining to give BYU a 24-21 victory against the
University of Tulsa in college football’s Armed Forces Bowl.  Nelson, who was 17-of-40 for 250 yards, hit Hoffman with a
two-yard scoring pass for the decisive touchdown for BYU (10-3).
Nelson also had touchdown throws of 30 and 17 yards to Hoffman.  G.J. Kinne had three scoring passes for the Golden
Hurricane (8-5) in the game in  Dallas .  Ballard Leads Mississippi  Rutgers (9-5), which was ranked 115th in college football’s
120-team top tier in rushing this season, ran for 173 yards
against the Cyclones (6-7). Rutgers took a 7-6 lead on a one-
yard touchdown run by Jamison with 12:39 remaining in the first
half and never trailed again.  At LP Field in Nashville,  Tennessee , Ballard ran for 60
yards with three minutes left in the first quarter to tie the
score at 7-7 for Mississippi State (7-6). He added the winning
touchdown in the fourth quarter with a 72-yard run. Ballard
carried 14 times for 180 yards.  Brandon Pendergrass and Tommy Bohanon scored touchdowns for
Wake Forest (6-7).  At Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe,  Arizona , Bell rushed for a
4-yard touchdown in the first quarter and repeated the feat in
the second to give the Sooners (9-3) a 14-0 halftime lead. He
capped the team’s scoring with a touchdown with 45 seconds left
in the game on a 21-yard run.  James Vandenburg put the Hawkeyes (7-5) on the scoreboard
in the fourth quarter with back-to-back touchdown passes of 5
yards to C.J. Fiedorowicz and 9 yards to Jordan Canzeri.  To contact the reporters on this story:
