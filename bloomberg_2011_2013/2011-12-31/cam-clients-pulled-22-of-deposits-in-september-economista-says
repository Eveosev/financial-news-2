Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM) 
clients withdraw 22 percent of their deposits in September after
the company was criticized by Bank of Spain governor Miguel
Angel Fernandez Ordonez,  El Economista  reported today.  Clients took 11.8 billion euros ($15.3 billion) out of CAM
accounts after Ordonez called it “the worst of the worst,” the
newspaper said, citing a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
