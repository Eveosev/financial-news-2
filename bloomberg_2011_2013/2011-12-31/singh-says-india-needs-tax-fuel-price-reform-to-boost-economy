Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said
India must reform its tax code and phase out fuel subsidies to
stabilize the South Asian nation’s finances.  “I am concerned about fiscal stability in future because
our fiscal deficit has worsened in the past three years,” he
said in a New Year’s  statement  to the nation. “We have run out
of fiscal space and must once again begin the process of fiscal
consolidation.”  The country must modernize its indirect tax system by
introducing a goods and services tax that would be more
efficient and also boost revenues, he said. The prime minister
also said the nation must phase out its fuel subsidies and
implement a “more rational pricing policy, aligning  India ’s
energy prices with global prices.”  India’s state-run refineries sell diesel, kerosene and
cooking gas below cost to help curb inflation, although the
government set gasoline prices free of all controls in June. The
 finance ministry  said on Dec. 9 that it may fail to meet its
budget-deficit target of 4.6 percent of gross domestic product
in the year ending March 31, as the government struggles to sell
stakes in state-run companies and a slowing economy affects tax
collections.  “Some subsidies, such as food subsidies are justifiable on
social grounds,” Singh said. “But there are other subsidies
that are not and these must be contained.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
