The euro had a second consecutive
annual loss against the dollar for the first time in a decade as
rising yields on the region’s sovereign debt reflected
speculation about defaults and stalling economic growth.  In its 13th year of existence, the 17-nation currency fell
below 100 yen for the first time since 2001 as the region’s
leaders bailed out  Portugal , and Italy, with the world’s third-
largest bond market, had its worst year since at least 1992. The
Swiss franc rose against a majority of its most-traded
counterparts as Europe’s debt crisis spurred demand for safety.
 Japan ’s currency’s average price was the strongest on record
versus the greenback even after three interventions to weaken
the yen by the nation’s central bank.  “It really has been all about the euro this year,” said
 Mary Nicola , a New York-based currency strategist at BNP Paribas
SA. “It’s been a back-and-forth year for the euro and the focus
has been on politicians and how the politicians would react.”  The euro declined 3.2 percent to $1.2961 against the dollar
in New York It reached a high of $1.4940 on May 4 on speculation
the  European Central Bank  would raise  interest rates (EURR002W)  and touched
a low of $1.2858 on Dec. 29 as concern increased that the
central bank may inject more currency into the financial system.  Currency Pairs  The shared currency tumbled 8.2 percent to 99.66 yen. It
fell below 100 yen for the first time since 2001 yesterday. The
dollar declined for a second year versus the Japanese currency,
falling 5.2 percent to 76.91 yen. It traded at an average 79.71
yen per dollar in 2011, the weakest year since Bloomberg records
began.  South Africa’s rand was the worst-performing major
currency versus the dollar, falling 18 percent to 8.0900 per
dollar as Europe’s debt crisis sapped demand for exports.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, gained 1.6 percent to 80.205, recording back-
to-back annual gains for the first time since 2000-2001.  The dollar’s gains during the final two quarters of the
year belied  Standard & Poor’s  stripping the U.S. of its AAA
credit rating in August.  The U.S. currency’s portion of global foreign-exchange
reserves rose to 61.7 percent in the period ended Sept. 30, the
highest since the last three months of 2010. Reserves increased
from 60.3 percent in the prior quarter, according to data from
the  International Monetary Fund . The share of euros fell to 25.7
percent, the lowest since July through September in 2008.  Dollar Standing  While S&P had used the dollar’s position as the world’s
reserve currency to reaffirm its AAA rating in April, the
company cited the weakening “effectiveness, stability and
predictability of American policy-making and political
institutions,” in its Aug. 5 downgrade of the U.S.  “The U.S. downgrade, people didn’t see that coming,” said
Brian Kim, a currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc’s RBS Securities unit in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “You get
the sense that people are thinking that 2012 could be a repeat
of a lot of factors from 2011.  Europe ’s still going to have
problems.”  Investors turned to the franc and the yen in a search for
refuge, causing the nation’s two central banks to intervene to
stem currency gains.  Japan’s currency gained against all 16 of its major
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. It was also the best
performer of 10 developed-nation currencies, according to the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, adding 5.5 percent. The
dollar rose 1.1 percent, and New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.5
percent.  Bank Buys  The  Bank of Japan  sold a record 9.09 trillion yen ($120
billion) from Oct. 28 to Nov. 28 in its third intervention in
2011 as the currency reached a post World War II-high of 75.35
per dollar on Oct. 31. On Aug. 4 it sold 4.5 trillion yen and on
March 18 the Japanese officials appealed to the Group of Seven
nations, who jointly intervened in the foreign-exchange markets
for the first time in more than a decade after a deadly March 11
earthquake and tsunami.  The Treasury Department, in a semiannual report to Congress
on the currency policies of major trading partners, criticized
Japan on its unilateral interventions.  The franc fell 0.4 percent to 93.87 centimes per dollar,
declining for the first time in six years. It rose 2.2 percent
to 1.2159 per euro after reaching a record 1.0075 on Aug. 9,
which led the Swiss National Bank to announce on Sept. 6 it
would purchase “unlimited quantities” of foreign currencies to
prevent the franc from strengthening beyond 1.20 per euro. The
central bank has since defended that level.  Swiss Levels  “The rise in the Swiss franc was primarily driven on safe-
haven demand, as there’s very little fundamentally that would
support the franc at that level,” said  Mark McCormick , a New
York-based currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
“The yen looks much less fundamentally overvalued.”  Investors exited higher-risk assets by unwinding so-called
carry trades, which use borrowings in currencies of nations with
low  interest rates  to buy assets in economies with higher
yields, as volatility soared. The  strategy (UBCIV24)  lost 15 percent this
year, the most since at least 1999, when records began,
according to an index compiled by UBS AG.  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to $1.0209. It reached
$1.1081 on July 27, the highest since the currency was freely
floated in 1983 as the nation recovered from floods that shut
mines and wiped out crops.  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to 77.72 U.S. cents.
It reached a post 1985-float record of 88.43 U.S cents on Aug. 1
after the nation’s economy showed signs of recovery after a
February earthquake.  Below Average  The euro was the worst performer according to the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, declining 2 percent as concern
rising debt yields were unsustainable for European nations.  The ECB reversed the 50 basis point interest-rate increases
this year and on Nov. 30 six central banks led by the  Federal
Reserve  acted to make it cheaper for banks to borrow in dollars
in emergencies.  “With  Italy  and Spain becoming embroiled in the crisis,
it’s led to a pretty sharp reversal in terms of the policy
stance of the ECB and clearly that’s been very relevant for the
euro,” said  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at
 Wells Fargo & Co . in New York. “We suspect that the ECB will
continue with its very aggressive and easy monetary policy and
liquidity policy stance and that’ll continue to weigh on the
euro.”  Italian bonds handed investors lost 5.7 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Canada Trades  Canada’s dollar traded stronger than parity with its U.S
counterpart on average this year for the first time in more than
three decades as investors sought assets of highly rated
governments relatively isolated from euro-area debt woes. The
loonie, as the currency is known, lost 2.3 percent to C$1.0213.
It averaged 98.91 cents per  U.S. dollar  this year, the strongest
annual value since 1976.  Hedge funds and other large speculators had 159,719 more
aggregate bets the dollar will gain in the week ended Dec. 27,
according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
as compiled by Bloomberg. Futures traders added 14,182 wagers
that the euro would fall against the greenback to a record
127,879 contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
