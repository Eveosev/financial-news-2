The  San Diego Padres  acquired All-
Star outfielder Carlos Quentin from the  Chicago White Sox  for
two minor-league pitchers, the Major League Baseball teams said
on their websites.  Quentin, 29, hit .254 with 24 home runs and 77 runs batted
in last season. The two-time All-Star has a .252 average with
121 homers and 383 RBI in six seasons with Arizona and Chicago.  The White Sox receive right-hander Simon Castro and left-
hander Pedro Hernandez.  Castro, 23, went 7-8 with a 5.63 earned run average at
Double-A and Triple-A last season. Hernandez, 22, was 10-3 with
a 3.49 ERA over three levels of San Diegoâ€™s minor-league system
in 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
