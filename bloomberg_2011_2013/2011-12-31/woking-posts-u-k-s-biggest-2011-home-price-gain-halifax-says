Woking in southeast  England  posted
the largest house-price gain among the U.K.’s towns and cities
this year, according to Lloyds Banking Group Plc’s Halifax unit.  The average selling price of a home in Woking rose 16
percent in the 12 months to December to 299,654 pounds
($465,000), compared with a national decline of 4 percent, the
U.K.’s largest mortgage lender said in an e-mailed statement
today. The town lies about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southwest of
London on a main rail line from the capital’s Waterloo station.  Falkirk in central  Scotland  was second in the list of 130
U.K. towns and cities with a 12 percent gain, followed by
Ipswich in England’s East Anglia region with a 9 percent rise,
Halifax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
