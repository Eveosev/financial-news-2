Chilean authorities filed charges
against an Israeli tourist in connection with a blaze that has
destroyed thousands of hectares in the  Parque Nacional Torres
del Paine , a main tourist attraction.  More than 550 government and military personnel from Chile
and  Argentina  and several aircraft were deployed to combat the
fire that is entering its sixth day, according to the website of
Chile’s emergency agency, Onemi. Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter said more than 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres) have
been consumed.  Rotem Singer, a 23-year-old Israeli tourist, was charged
yesterday with starting the fire, said Carolina Delard, a
spokeswoman for the office of prosecutor in the city of Puerto
Natales, in a telephone interview. Singer was released and
ordered to remain in the region for the next three months as
authorities conduct an investigation.  The 180,000-hectare park in  Chile ’s Patagonia region is
famous for its vertical  granite peaks  and is  home to Andean
condors , pumas and  endangered huemul  deer.  Chile has declared a so-called state of catastrophe in the
province. The government is interviewing and collecting data
from the 400 tourists who were evacuated from the park.  In 2005, a Czech tourist started a fire in the same park
when his camping stove fell over. He was arrested and deported.
Firefighters took about 30 days to control that blaze, Hinzpeter
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
