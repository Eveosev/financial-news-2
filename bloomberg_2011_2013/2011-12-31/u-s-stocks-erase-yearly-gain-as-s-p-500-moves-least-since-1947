U.S. stocks fell this week, leaving
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index virtually unchanged for the
year, as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will weigh on the economy
halted a two-year rally in equities.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities lost 0.04 point to
1,257.60 in 2011, the smallest  annual change (SPX)  since 1947.
Financial shares slid 1.3 percent in the week and 18 percent
this year, the worst drop among 10 industries, as Bank of
America Corp. tumbled 58 percent. Commodity producers fell 12
percent as a group. First Solar Inc. had the biggest drop in the
 S&P 500 , losing 74 percent, followed by coal producer Alpha
Natural Resources Inc. with a 66 percent loss.  Gauges of health-care companies, utilities and makers of
household products and other consumer staples climbed more than
10 percent this year as investors bought companies whose profits
are least-tied to economic growth. Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. in
Houston rose 101 percent in 2011 for the gauge’s biggest rally,
followed by pipeline owner El Paso Corp. and Sunnyvale,
California-based medical device maker Intuitive Surgical Inc.  “It’s the year I’d like to forget because of all the
tumult in the markets,” Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee $209
billion as chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage
Funds in  Menomonee Falls ,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone
interview. “The U.S. data has been looking better but it’s not
just the matter of the U.S. data but what’s the outlook, and
investors are still concerned about whether or not economic
recovery is losing steam.”  European Concerns  The S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent this week as  Spain ’s widening
budget deficit and a surge in the  European Central Bank ’s
balance sheet stoked concern over the region’s debt crisis,
offsetting better-than-expected U.S. consumer confidence and
home sales data. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  declined 76.44
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,217.56, paring its 2011 gain to
5.5 percent.  The S&P 500 finished the year recording record price swings
and correlations. The benchmark index started the year with a
rally, rising as much as 8.4 percent to a three-year high by the
end of April and extending its rebound from a March 2009 bear-
market low to 102 percent.  The index tumbled throughout the summer as Congress and
President  Barack Obama  struggled over U.S. deficit cuts, leading
S&P to strip the nation of its AAA rating in August, and concern
grew that the euro-area’s debt crisis was threatening the global
economic recovery. The S&P 500 fell as much as 19 percent from
April to its low for the year on Oct. 3.  Rising Correlations  Developments in Europe’s efforts to tame its debt crisis
led to near-lockstep movement in equity prices. The 50-day
correlation of S&P 500 stocks to gains or losses in the full
index increased to a record 0.86 in October, according to data
compiled by Westport, Connecticut-based Birinyi Associates Inc.
A level of 1 would mean all 500 stocks moved together.
Correlation was 0.78 on Dec. 30, 73 percent higher than its
average since 1980.  The Dow alternated between gains and losses of more than
400 points on four days for the first time ever in August. Daily
share swings in the S&P 500 averaged 2.2 percent that month, the
most for any August since 1932, Bloomberg data show. The index
moved an average of 1.9 percent a day from May through the end
of the year, compared with the 50-year average of 0.6 percent
before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.  Fund Withdrawals  Investors have been pulling money from mutual funds that
focus on  U.S. stocks (SPX)  for a fifth year. Outflows totaled $116
billion in the first 11 months of this year, the highest since
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from the
 Investment Company Institute , a Washington-based trade group.  U.S. companies have beaten analyst  profit (SPX)  estimates for 11
straight quarters as the country climbed out of the worst
recession since the Great Depression. Earnings from S&P 500
companies are forecast to reach a record $98.79 a share this
year, and climb 9.7 percent in 2012 and 12 percent in 2013,
according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  As stock prices failed to keep up pace with earnings,
valuations reached levels cheaper than 72 percent of the time
since 1954, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500
ended the year trading at 13.2 times  reported earnings (SPX) , 20
percent below the average multiple of 16.4, the data show.  ‘Murky Outlook’  “If you look at balance sheets and cash flow statements,
stocks are attractively valued, but they’re not incredibly cheap
considering the murky outlook that we have from the political
arena,” Jacobsen at Wells Fargo said. “People are clamoring
for safer assets, the classic defensive sectors.”  The  Morgan Stanley Consumer Index (CYC) , which tracks drugmakers
and food companies, added 0.7 percent this year, compared with a
16 percent loss in the firm’s cyclical measure of commodity
producers and transportation providers.  The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, which follows
companies that have raised payout for at least 25 consecutive
years, returned 8.3 percent. The S&P 500 ended the year with a
dividend yield of 2.1 percent, compared with a rate of 1.88
percent for 10-year Treasuries, and the index returned 2.1
percent in 2011 including reinvested dividends.  Bank of America plunged 58 percent to $5.56 in 2011, making
it the  worst performer (INDU)  in the Dow, as concern about mounting
mortgage losses and a global economic slowdown weighed on the
second-biggest U.S. lender. The decline erased almost $80
billion of  shareholder value , and was the firm’s largest drop
since a 66 percent plunge in 2008, when a U.S. bailout staved
off a collapse.  Alcoa, First Solar  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , largest U.S. aluminum producer, slumped 44
percent to $8.65 this year for the second-worst drop in the Dow
as prices of the lightweight metal tumbled 18 percent.  First Solar tumbled 74 percent to $33.76. The biggest
manufacturer of thin-film solar cells slashed its sales and
profit forecasts for 2011 after ousting Rob Gillette as chief
executive.  Alpha Natural declined 66 percent to $20.43 after acquiring
Massey Energy Co. for $7.1 billion and announcing earnings that
missed analysts’ estimates for the first two quarters of 2011.  Cabot Oil surged 101 percent to $75.90 this year. The
company, which has fields in  Pennsylvania ,  Texas  and  Oklahoma ,
projected output will rise as much as 55 percent next year.  El
Paso (EP) , based in Houston, rallied 93 percent to $26.57 in 2011
after agreeing to be bought by Kinder Morgan Inc. for $21
billion.  Intuitive Surgical jumped 80 percent to $463.01. The maker
of a robotic system to perform surgery reported earnings that
beat analyst estimates for the 10th  straight quarter (ISGR) , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  dropped 61 percent to $69.29. The video-
streaming and DVD subscription service reduced its subscriber
forecast and predicted losses in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
