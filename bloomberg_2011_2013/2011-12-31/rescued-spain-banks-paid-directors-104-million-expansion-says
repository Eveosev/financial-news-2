Seven Spanish savings banks that
were bailed out with public money paid their directors almost 80
million euros ($104 million) in basic salaries this year,
 Expansion  reported.  Former International Monetary Fund head Rodrigo Rato was
the highest paid, earning 2.34 million euros as chairman of
Bankia SA, the newspaper said, citing Bank of  Spain  figures. Any
bonus that Rato or the other executives earn on top of their
salaries must be approved by the central bank, the Expansion
reported.  The lenders have received more than 17 billion euros of
financing from the countryâ€™s rescue fund, Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
