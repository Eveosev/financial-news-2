Former All Blacks coach  Graham Henry 
was awarded a knighthood in  New Zealand  after leading the South
Pacific nation to its Rugby World Cup victory this year,
TVNZ.co.nz reported.  Henry, 65, was given the honor for his services to the
sport, the website said.  All Blacks captain Richie McCaw rejected the idea of
knighthood after being approached by New Zealand Prime Minister
John Key, indicating the timing wasn’t right because he’s still
playing the game, the New Zealand Herald reported Dec. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
