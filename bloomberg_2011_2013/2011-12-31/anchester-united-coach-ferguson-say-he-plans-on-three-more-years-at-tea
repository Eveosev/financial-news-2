Manchester United manager  Alex Ferguson  said he intends to stay in charge of the 19-time
English soccer champion for another three years.  Ferguson, who celebrates his 70th birthday today, said
in an  interview  on United’s website he expects to stay at Old
Trafford as long as he remains healthy.  “I think I’ve got three more years at the club,” he said.
“As long as my health stays up, and as long as I’m still
enjoying it and still getting the satisfaction of the team doing
its best.”  Fans at Old Trafford sang “ Happy Birthday ” to Ferguson
before today’s 3-2 home loss to Blackburn which prevented United
from moving into first place in the Premier League. United
remains tied with  Manchester City , which plays at Sunderland
tomorrow.  United has won the English league 12 times, two Champions
League titles, five F.A. Cups and the English League Cup four
times since Ferguson became manager in 1986. It’s reached the
Champions League final three of the past four seasons including
last year when it lost to Barcelona.  “We have to continue the dominance of winning leagues, and
without question, winning a European Cup is important to this
club,” Ferguson said. “We should have been in another three
finals. But you can’t be greedy and having won two in my time is
an achievement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
