Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
said the country faces a difficult year ahead and must continue
its efforts to remain in the euro and avoid economic collapse.  “The next three months will be particularly crucial,”
Papademos said in an e-mail sent today from his Athens-based
office. “The decisions taken will determine the course of
Greece in the coming decades.”  Papademos, appointed on Nov. 11 as head of a government
backed by three of the five parliamentary parties, is trying to
secure loans under a 130 billion-euro ($168.5 billion) bailout
for Greece agreed to in October by European Union leaders before
elections are held. Measures include negotiating a debt swap
with private creditors that will cut 100 billion euros off
 Greece ’s burden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
