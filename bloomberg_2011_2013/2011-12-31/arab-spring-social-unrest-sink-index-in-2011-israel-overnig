Israeli stocks traded in New York (ISRA25BN) 
fell last year, with the  Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index (ISRA25BN)  lagging
the Nasdaq Composite Index by the most since 2006, on concern
uprisings in Arab nations and local protests over rising
consumer prices will reduce companies’ revenue.  The measure of the largest Israeli companies traded in New
York fell 19 percent last year, the biggest annual drop since
Bloomberg began tracking the index in 2006.  Partner
Communications Co. (PTNR)  and  Alon Holdings Blue Square-Israel Ltd. (BSI)  led
declines among most-traded shares. The Nasdaq Composite Index
lost 1.8 percent. The  Tel Aviv   benchmark TA-25 Index (TA-25)  tumbled 18
percent in 2011, the worst performance since 2008. The gauge
gained 1.3 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  Mounting concern that Arab Spring revolts in Egypt, Libya,
Tunisia and Yemen will raise security threats in the region
along with heightened regulation following social unrest in the
Jewish state have pushed stocks lower, according to Ori Licht,
head of research at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd.  “In addition to all the troubles you see around the world,
Israel is facing these specific hurdles with the Arab Spring and
the social protests,” Licht said by phone from Tel Aviv.
“That’s what led to the underperformance.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  was little changed in 2011,
while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 11 percent as U.S.
leaders wrangled over deficit cuts and European policymakers
remained divided on their response to the debt crisis.  TA-25 Declines  The shekel weakened 7.5 percent last year, the most since
2001, to 3.8106 a dollar.  Partner, Israel’s second-largest mobile phone provider,
 dropped (PTNR)  57 percent last year to $8.84, the biggest decline since
2000. The Tel Aviv shares sank 53 percent, the most since they
started trading in 2002.  Shares fell as the government steps up efforts to boost
competition in the local cellular market and on mounting concern
about shareholder Ilan Ben Dov’s investment company Tao Tsuot
Ltd.’s debt problems. Partner said in August that it won’t pay a
second-quarter dividend because of the changes in the
telecommunication market.  “Foreign investors are pulling out because they saw the
impact of the protests and companies starting to report lower
profits,” said Uriel Goren, the head of international clients
desk at DS Securities & Investments. Partner advanced 3 percent
today to 34.68 shekels, or the equivalent of $9.10.  Cost-of-Living Protests  Blue Square,  Israel ’s second-largest food retailer, dropped
55 percent last year to $3.97, the most since 2008, as
demonstrations and boycotts by Israelis against increases in the
cost of living have led companies to cut prices.  Gross domestic product (ISGDPNYY)  expanded an annualized 3.4 percent
in the third quarter, slowing from 5 percent in the year-earlier
period, according to the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of
Statistics. The growth has been easing as the debt crisis in
Europe crimps demand for exports such as electronic components.
Overseas shipments account for almost 40 percent of Israel’s
gross domestic product.  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
to  Switzerland ’s, has about 60 companies traded on the Nasdaq
stock market, the most of any country outside  North America 
after  China . It’s also home to the largest number of startup
companies per capita in the world.  Technology companies led gains on the  Bloomberg Israel-US
25 Index (ISRA25BN)  in 2011, with  Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT)  advancing 31
percent to $15.20 and  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  jumping 24
percent to $32.49.  Allot Sales Forecast  Allot, the maker of equipment for monitoring Internet
traffic, will  probably report (ALLT)  2011 sales of $76 million, a 34
percent rise from 2010, according to the median estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Allot pared some gains last year after Bloomberg News
reported that the company’s gear was sold to  Iran  and a lawmaker
called for an investigation. Chief Executive Officer Rami Hadar
said in a Dec. 23 e-mail that the company didn’t know its
products were sold to Iran.  Mellanox, the adapter maker part-owned by  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ,
“will see additional benefit as the data boom necessitates
high-performance technologies in non-traditional markets,”
Brian Freed, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities Inc., wrote in
an e-mailed report last week.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , the world’s largest
maker of generic drugs, dropped 23 percent to $40.36, the most
since 2006, as new rivals emerged for the drugmaker’s multiple
sclerosis treatment Copaxone, and the company introduced fewer
drugs last year.  Teva’s Israeli shares, down 18 percent last year, gained
1.4 percent to 155.5 shekels today, or the equivalent of $40.81.  Perrigo Co. (PRGO) , the largest U.S. maker of generic over-the-
counter drugs, climbed 54 percent to $97.30 in New York. The Tel
Aviv shares, up 64 percent last year, were the biggest gainers
on the  TA-25 Index (TA-25) , after the company was added to the  S&P 500 
and Nasdaq 100 indexes last year.  The shares closed unchanged today at 374 shekels, or the
equivalent of $98.15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
