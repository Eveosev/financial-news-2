Iran ’s top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili plans to submit a letter to European Union foreign policy
chief Catherine Ashton to restart talks on the country’s nuclear
program, Mehr news agency reported today, citing Iran’s
ambassador to Germany.  A new round of talks between Iran and the five permanent
members of the UN Security Council and Germany may follow,
Alireza Sheikh Attar told the  state-run  news agency.  Michael Mann , a spokesman for Ashton, said today that she
hadn’t received a response to a letter sent to Jalili in
October.  The EU continues to pursue a “twin-track approach” and is
“open for meaningful discussions on confidence-building
measures, without preconditions from the Iranian side,” Mann
said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Iran is facing new Western efforts to halt its suspected
nuclear weapons program, including U.S. sanctions that are
awaiting President  Barack Obama ’s signature and a possible
European Union ban on imports of oil from Iran, the world’s
third-largest oil exporter. Iran denies seeking to develop
atomic weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
