Shares in  Saudi Arabia , the world’s
biggest oil exporter, fell as crude declined on concern over
demand from  China  and tension simmered on Iran’s naval exercises
in the Strait of Hormuz.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  lost less than 0.01 percent to
6,417.73 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh, after falling the
most in more than two weeks. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., the
world’s biggest petrochemicals maker, retreated 0.8 percent.  Oil fell 0.8 percent to close at $98.83 a barrel yesterday
as Chinese manufacturing contracted for a second month in
December, spurring concern that demand from the world’s second-
largest crude-consuming country may slow. Iran last week
threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a shipping channel
through which a sixth of the world’s is transported, if
sanctions are imposed on its crude exports.  “With the lack of local news and activity in the market,
some investors are booking profit and focusing on the
geopolitical news in the region,” said Samer Darwiche, an
equity analyst at Gulfmena Investment in Dubai. “You have also
to factor in it’s New Year’s eve and activity is low.”  Saudi Basic (SABIC) , which accounts for 12 percent of the benchmark
index, retreated to 96.25 riyals. Savola Group gained 1.4
percent to 28.7 riyals. The Saudi Arabian food producer said
last week it was selling land in the kingdom and expanding in
 Egypt .  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
