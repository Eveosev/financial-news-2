China Southern Airlines Co. plans to
increase revenue from international flights next year to 30
percent of total sales, the French daily Le Figaro reported,
citing Tan Wan Geng, the airlineâ€™s president.  The airline currently loses money on its international
routes while its domestic lines, which this year made up 72
percent of sales, are profitable, the newspaper said, citing
Tan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
