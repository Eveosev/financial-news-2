Blackburn Rovers defeated Manchester
United 3-2 to move out of last place in English soccer’s Premier
League.  Grant Hanley scored the winning goal with 10 minutes
remaining in Manchester as Blackburn moved up two spots to 18th
in the 20-team league. Ayegbeni Yakubu had two goals as Rovers
beat United for just the second time in 18 Premier League
meetings.  Dimitar Berbatov scored both goals for United, which would
have moved into first place with a win or draw. United remains
even at the top of the standings with  Manchester City , which
plays at Sunderland tomorrow, with both having 45 points.  United manager  Alex Ferguson  said before the game on the
club’s website that he expected to remain in charge for another
three years. Ferguson, who turns 70 today, is in his 25th season
with United.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
