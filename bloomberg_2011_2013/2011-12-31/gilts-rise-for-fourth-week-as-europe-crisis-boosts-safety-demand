U.K. government bonds rose for a
fourth week, with two- and 10-year yields dropping to records,
as investors sought safer assets after  European Central Bank 
loans failed to soothe turmoil in euro-area debt markets.  Gilts completed a second year of gains, returning 17
percent on average and outperforming German bunds and  U.S.
Treasuries . Ten-year  yields (GUKG10)  fell yesterday to the lowest since
Bloomberg started tracking them in 1989 as an industry report
showing  home prices  declined added to signs the recovery is
faltering. The pound completed a third yearly advance versus the
euro after 15 European summits in two years failed to stop the
debt crisis from spreading.  The outlook for gilts “really depends on what happens with
the European situation,” said Vatsala Datta, an interest-rate
strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London. “If we
get something on a positive bent then we might see yields bounce
back above two percent. But on relative terms, I think they will
be supported against Treasuries and bunds.”  The  10-year yield (GUKG1O)  fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, this week to 1.98 percent after dropping to a record
1.932 percent. The 3.75 percent bond due in September 2021
gained 0.55, or 5.50 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,552) face
amount, to 115.54.  Two-year  yields (GUKG2)  declined one basis point to 0.33 percent,
after falling to an all-time low 0.271 percent yesterday.  ‘Systemic Stress’  U.K. bond yields have dropped every week since  Standard &
Poor’s  put 15 euro nations on watch for a possible downgrade on
Dec. 5, including AAA rated  Germany  and  France . S&P said it
placed the countries on review as “systemic stress in the euro
zone has risen in recent weeks.”  Concern Italy will struggle to repay its debt pushed its
10-year yields above 7 percent this week, boosting demand for
the safety of gilts. The Mediterranean nation raised less than
its maximum target at an auction on Dec. 29, even after the
European Central Bank provided banks with a record 489 billion
euros ($635 billion) of three-year loans.  The 17 percent return from gilts this year is most since
1998, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. German
securities,  Europe ’s benchmark, gained 9.6 percent, Treasuries
rose 9.8 percent, and Italian debt tumbled 5.7 percent, the
indexes show.  Slowing Economy  Gilts were boosted yesterday as  Nationwide Building Society 
 said (UKNBAAMM)  the average cost of a U.K. home fell 0.2 percent in
December, the first monthly drop since August.  The  Office for Budget Responsibility , Britain’s fiscal
watchdog, cut its forecasts for economic growth last month
to reflect the turmoil in Europe, the biggest market for U.K.
goods sold abroad.  The deteriorating economic outlook has prompted the
government to raise its planned gilt issuance for the 12 months
through March by 6.8 percent to 178.9 billion pounds. The first
sale of 2012 is an auction of five-year notes on Jan. 4.  The  Bank of England (UKAPTARG)  has supported the economy and the  bond
market  with 249 billion pounds of  gilt purchases (UKAPGPT) , so-called
quantitative easing, since March 2009. The ECB has failed to
replicate such measures in the  euro zone .  “Bunds are under threat because Germany may be the
ultimate payer for the other countries,” Lloyds’s Datta said.
“On a relative basis, prospects of further QE in the U.K. will
keep gilts supported.”  The pound has strengthened 2.6 percent against the euro
this year as the crisis weighed on the 17-member currency.
Sterling rose 0.2 percent to 83.57 pence per euro this week.  The U.K. currency weakened 0.3 percent this week to
$1.5536, and dropped 1.7 percent to 119.64 yen.  Sterling was little changed in 2011 according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10 developed-nation
currencies. The yen was the best performer, gaining 5.2 percent
and the dollar appreciated 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
