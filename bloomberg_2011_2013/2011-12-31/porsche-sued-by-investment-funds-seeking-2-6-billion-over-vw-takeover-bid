Porsche Automobil Holding SE (PAH3)  was
sued by a group of investment funds seeking about 2 billion
euros ($2.6 billion) in damages allegedly suffered from the
carmaker’s failed takeover attempt of  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  in 2008.  The group, whose members weren’t identified, filed the
lawsuit in the district court of Stuttgart,  Germany , according
to a statement released on the OTS newswire late yesterday. The
plaintiffs also filed an arbitration application regarding
 Volkswagen (VOW) , two members of the VW supervisory board and one
member of the management board of VW, according to the
statement.  “The accusations are not justified and we reject them,”
Frank Gaube, a spokesman for Stuttgart-based Porsche, said by
telephone today. The company needs to receive the suit before it
can closely examine it, he said.  Porsche and VW agreed to combine in 2009 after Porsche
racked up more than 10 billion euros of debt in an unsuccessful
attempt to gain control of VW. The merger has been held up by
lawsuits linked to Porsche’s failed effort to buy VW, with the
Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker waiting to avoid being held
responsible for any financial ramifications from the suits.  The investor group’s complaint alleges that “Porsche
gained control over the price of VW common stock as it secretly
built enormous derivative positions covering almost all of VW’s
freely traded shares, then triggered a massive short squeeze,
and finally released billions of euros worth of shares into the
short squeeze for its own profit,” according to the statement.  VW spokesman Michael Brendel didn’t immediately respond to
a voicemail message left on his mobile phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
