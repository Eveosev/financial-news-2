David Beckham  is leaning toward
remaining with Major League Soccer’s Los Angeles Galaxy, the
British Broadcasting Corp. reported on its website today, 
without citing anyone for the information.  Beckham’s five-year contract with Los Angeles expires today
and the former England captain has been linked with a move to
French league leader Paris Saint-Germain.  The Galaxy and MLS have offered Beckham a one-year rolling
contract that would allow him to play for Great Britian at the
2012 London Olympics if selected, the  BBC  said.  Beckham, 36, has been discussing his future with his family
and business partner Simon Fuller, the BBC said. His wife
Victoria and children feel settled in California and are happy
to stay, the broadcaster said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
