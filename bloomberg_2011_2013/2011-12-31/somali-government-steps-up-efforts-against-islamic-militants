Somalia stepped up efforts to rid
the nation of Islamic militants and called on its neighbors
including  Ethiopia  to support the efforts.  The government started the so-called Operation to Restore
Peace and Stability in Somalia, according to an e-mailed
statement from the prime minister’s office today.  “Today, the government and the people of Somalia have
stood up against the evils of al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab
terrorists, who have for so long, terrorized and killed
countless Somalis and our neighbors,” Prime Minister  Abdiweli
Mohamed Ali said in the statement. “Our people have suffered
harshly under their occupation. Today, we have initiated the
process to liberate the tyranny of al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab from
Somalia.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
