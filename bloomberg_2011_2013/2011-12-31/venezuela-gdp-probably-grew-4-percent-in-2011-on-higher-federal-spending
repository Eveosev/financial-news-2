A surge in  government spending 
helped Venezuela’s economy, the third-largest in  South America ,
grow 4 percent in 2011 after two years of contraction, the
nation’s  central bank  said.  Expansion was propelled by government construction projects
and a recovery in the manufacturing sector, the central bank
said today in a report, citing preliminary figures. Official
gross domestic product data will be released in late February.  “The recent performance of the Venezuelan economy ratifies
the recovery of various productive sectors and allows us to be
optimistic about sustained economic growth,” central bank
president Nelson Merentes said today in an e-mailed statement.  The resolution of a power shortage, which caused
manufacturing to collapse in 2010, boosted the economic
recovery, Merentes said. Government spending rose 6 percent and
the amount of dollars available in the economy rose 12.7
percent, according to the report.  President  Hugo Chavez  is preparing for his re-election bid
in October. Spending this year has been buoyed by an average oil
export price of more than $100 a barrel this year, the highest
on record, and more than $17 billion of dollar bonds issued by
the government and state oil company  Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) .
Chavez has used this cash to expand social programs and fund
housing projects.  Government spending will probably accelerate in 2012,
pushing growth to as much as five percent, according to a Bank
of America report published on Dec. 27.  Non-oil sector GDP rose 4.3 percent this year and oil
sector GDP increased 0.6 percent, according to the Central Bank.
The country’s manufacturing sector grew 3.5 percent this year
and construction GDP increased 3.4 percent.  Imports  Imports rose 7 percent in 2011 to $45.6 billion, while oil
exports in dollar terms increased 27 percent to $89.3 billion,
according to the report.  Venezuela ’s current account surplus widened to $31.5
billion from $12.0 billion in 2010, and oil production rose 0.5
percent during the year, Merentes said, according to the
statement.  Venezuela, South America’s largest oil producer and a
founding member of OPEC, experienced economic contraction of 3.3
percent in 2009 and 1.4 percent in 2010.  Consumer prices climbed an estimated 27.6 percent over the
year compared to an increase of 27.2 percent in 2010, the
central bank said. The increase in inflation was caused by a
devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in late 2010 and supply
shortages of  consumer goods , according to the report.  Foreign direct investment in Venezuela rose $2.75 billion
in 2011, while private consumption increased 3.7 percent, the
central bank said.  Merentes said on Dec. 21 that the economy will probably
grow between four and six percent in 2012.  The  United Nations ’ economic unit for  Latin America  and the
Caribbean, known as Cepal, said on Dec. 21 that Venezuela’s
economy may grow 3 percent in 2012. That would be the third
lowest in the region after  El Salvador  and Cuba.  To contact the reporters on this story:
