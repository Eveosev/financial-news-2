Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  is open to consultations with European Union authorities
on the country’s central bank law, MTI reported yesterday,
citing Peter Szijjarto, Orban’s spokesman.  Orban wrote a letter to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso saying the law approved by Hungary’s parliament
yesterday incorporated the “vast majority” of suggestions from
the  European Central Bank  and is in line with EU law, Szijjarto
told the state-run news service.  The government doesn’t plan to use its power to merge the
central bank and the financial regulator during the term of
central bank President Andras Simor,  MTI  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
