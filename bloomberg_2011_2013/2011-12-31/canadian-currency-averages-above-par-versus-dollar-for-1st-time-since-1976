Canada ’s dollar traded stronger than
parity with its U.S counterpart on average this year for the
first time in three decades as investors sought assets of highly
rated governments as a haven from euro-area debt woes.  The currency averaged 98.92 Canadian cents per U.S. dollar
in 2011, the highest annual value since 1976, when it traded at
98.63 cents. It averaged C$1.5701 in 2002, the lowest since at
least 1971, when data began. Canada’s dollar had its strongest
annual close against the euro since the shared currency began
trading in 1999, underscoring the nation’s top debt ratings and
economic stability amid  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “The Canadian dollar has done well this past year because
of our position in the global economy,” said C.J. Gavsie,
managing director for foreign-exchange trading at Bank of
Montreal in Toronto. “Years of conservative practices by our
government, central bank and various regulators have contributed
to a steady economy and now a currency that is relatively stable
to other majors.”  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, ended the year at C$1.0213 versus
the  U.S. dollar , from 99.80 Canadian cents at the end of last
year for a loss of 2.3 percent. It rose 0.9 percent to C$1.3237
against the euro. It lost 7.9 percent to 75.32 yen. One Canadian
dollar buys 97.91 U.S. cents.  Three-Year High  The Canadian dollar touched 94.07 cents per U.S. dollar on
July 26, the highest in more than three years, on prospects for
higher  interest rates (CABROVER)  and as investors sought shelter from the
U.S. debt-ceiling impasse. The currency weakened from there,
touching C$1.0658 on Oct. 4, the lowest level in more than a
year, as the euro region’s debt crisis sapped demand for higher-
yielding assets such as stocks.  Canada and the U.K. are the only Group of Seven countries -
- which also include the U.S.,  Germany ,  France ,  Italy  and  Japan 
-- that have both a AAA rating and a “stable ” outlook,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Canada’s economy is
expanding 3 percent from a year earlier, more than double the
average rate for G-7 and euro-zone countries. Finance Minister
 Jim Flaherty  pledged his Conservative Party government will
eliminate the  budget deficit , forecast at C$31 billion this
fiscal year, by 2015.  After lifting the target rate three times last year from a
record low 0.25 percent, Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  has
held borrowing costs steady at 1 percent since September 2010,
even as  inflation (CACPIYOY)  exceeded the bank’s 2 percent target for 12
straight months.  The global economy risks entering into a “prolonged period
of deficient demand” as governments in the U.S. and Europe
struggle to reduce debt burdens, Governor Mark Carney said in a
Dec. 12 speech. Trading in overnight index swaps shows almost a
40 percent chance of a reduction in the central bank’s target
rate to 0.75 percent by September.  Equities Correlation  Movements in the Canadian dollar have been increasingly
tied to equities. The one-month correlation coefficient between
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and the Canadian dollar reached
0.9348 on Nov. 14, the strongest relationship since Bloomberg
data began in 1992, versus a two-decade average of 0.2437. A
reading of 1 indicates the measures move in lockstep. It ended
the year at 0.854. The  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent this year.  The loonie, with losses of 1.4 percent, is the fourth-worst
performer in 2011 after the euro, the Norwegian krone and
 Sweden ’s krona among the 10 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. It’s the best performer
in the past month after the yen, gaining 1.7 percent on
speculation the U.S. economy will recover from its torpor.  Upside ‘Surprises’  “As we leave 2011, that which was the albatross around the
loonie’s neck is that which gives it lift in 2012 -- that’s the
 U.S. economy ,” said  Stewart Hall , senior currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto. “The U.S. economy of late has
been throwing off upside economic surprises. To the degree to
which it can continue to do that, it sets the stage for a firmer
profile for the Canadian dollar versus some of the other G-10
currencies.”  Respondents to a Bloomberg survey predict the U.S. economy
will expand by 2.1 percent next year, the median of 70
responses. Canada’s economy will grow at a 2 percent pace next
year, a separate survey shows.  RBC predicts the Canadian dollar will end 2012 at parity
with the U.S. dollar. BMO’s Gavsie forecast the currency would
average C$1.04 in 2012, with a range of 98 cents to C$1.08.  It will depreciate to C$1.04 by the end of the first
quarter before rebounding to parity by year-end, according to
median forecasts of 33 analysts and economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Those forecasts have weakened from C$1.02 and 98
Canadian cents at the end of November.  Government Bonds  Canada’s government  bonds (GCAN5YR)  rose in 2011, driving yields
across the curve to record lows. The nation’s benchmark 10-year
yields fell to 1.94 percent, compared with 3.12 percent at the
end of last year. The yield touched 1.837 percent on Dec. 16,
the lowest level in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to
1989. Benchmark two-year yields touched 0.76 percent on Sept.
12, a record low.  Ten-year government  securities (.USCAD10)  yielded 6 basis points more
than equivalent-maturity U.S. Treasuries, compared with 32 basis
points more on Sept. 5, the most this year, and 17 basis points
less at the end of last year.  Canadian employers added 17,500 positions more than they
cut in December, according to the median of 17 forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg.  Statistics Canada  is due to release the
data on Jan. 6 in Ottawa.  “More stable economic and monetary-policy trends for
Canada are helping contribute to overall resilience in this
currency,” said  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at
 Wells Fargo & Co . in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
