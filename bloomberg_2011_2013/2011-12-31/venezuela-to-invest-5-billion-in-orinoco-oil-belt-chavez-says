Venezuela , a founding member of the
OPEC oil cartel, will invest $5 billion in the Orinoco heavy
crude belt in 2012 to increase production, President  Hugo Chavez 
said today on state television, without providing additional
information.  The South American country expects to increase production
to 3.5 million barrels a day in 2012 and 4 million barrels a day
in 2014, from about 3 million barrels a day now, Chavez said.
Venezuela wants to produce 6 million barrels of oil a day in
2019 and 10 million barrels daily by 2030, he said.  OPEC, in its December Oil Market Report,  said  that
Venezuela produced 2.36 million barrels of oil a day in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
