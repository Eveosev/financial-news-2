Nearly eight in 10 Greeks say the
country’s leaders should do whatever is needed to remain in the
euro and a majority say elections should be held by April, an
opinion poll showed.  Of the 1,004 people surveyed Dec. 28-29 by Kapa Research,
77.2 percent said leaders should take all measures to remain in
the euro zone while 16 percent said they preferred a return to
the drachma. The poll was published in the Sunday edition of To
Vima newspaper.  On asked when an election should be held, 56.2 percent said
it should be held in April after negotiations over a debt swap
with holders of Greek debt is completed, while 37.7 percent
favored the polls at the end of the governemnt’s term that
expires in 2013.  Nearly seven in 10, or 66 percent, of those surveyed had a
positive view of Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos , appointed on
Nov. 11 as head of a government backed by three of the five
parliamentary parties. Former Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
had an approval rating of 18.8 percent, while New Democracy
leader Antonis Samaras polled 35 percent.  Papademos is trying to secure loans under a 130 billion-
euro ($168.5 billion) bailout for  Greece  agreed to by European
Union leaders before elections are held. Measures include
negotiating a debt swap with private creditors that will cut 100
billion euros off Greece’s burden.  If elections were held next week, the Pasok party led by
Papandreou would garner the support of 12.6 percent of those
polled, while the New Democracy Party, headed by Antonis
Samaras, would be the choice of 21.4 percent. The nationalist
Laos party, which is also part of the interim government along
with Pasok and  New Democracy , was backed by 5.3 percent. Nearly
30 percent were undecided.  The Communist Party of Greece would receive 9.3 percent of
the vote and the Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, would
get 6.2 percent, the poll suggested. Both Syriza and the
Communist Party declined to join the interim government.  The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.09
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
