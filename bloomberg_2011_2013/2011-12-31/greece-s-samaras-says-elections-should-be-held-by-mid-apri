Antonis Samaras, leader of  Greece ’s
New Democracy Party, said national elections should be held no
later than mid-April after agreement is reached on a debt swap
and new loan package for the country.  “If an agreement for the exchange of Greek bonds finishes
earlier, then elections should happen earlier,” Samaras wrote
in the Sunday edition of Real News. “If a few more weeks are
needed, then elections can be delayed, but not past Easter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
