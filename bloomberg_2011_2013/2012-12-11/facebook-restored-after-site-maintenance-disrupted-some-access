Facebook Inc. (FB)  said it fixed an
outage that left some users unable to access its social network
while the company made a change to the site’s infrastructure,
following a separate disruption at  Google Inc. (GOOG)  earlier today.  “We made a change to our DNS infrastructure, and that
change resulted in some people being temporarily unable to reach
the site,” Alexandra Hollander, a spokeswoman for Menlo Park,
 California-based Facebook , said in an e-mailed statement. “We
detected and resolved the issue quickly, and we are now back to
100 percent.”  Google, owner of the most popular Internet search engine,
also had to restore service to some users after its Gmail e-mail
services were disrupted this morning. In a Web posting, Google
said at 9:30 a.m. San Francisco time that it was investigating
reports of an issue with Google Mail. At 10:10 a.m., the company
said the issue had been fixed.  “System reliability is a top priority at Google, and we
are making continuous improvements to make our systems better,”
the Mountain View, California-based company wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
