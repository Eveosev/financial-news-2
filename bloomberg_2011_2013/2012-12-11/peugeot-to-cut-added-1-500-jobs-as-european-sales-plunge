PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , Europe’s
second-largest carmaker, will eliminate an additional 1,500 jobs
by 2014, deepening its  workforce reduction  as auto sales in the
region plunge to a 17-year low.  The cuts, which come on top of 8,000 announced in July,
will be made by not replacing  people  who leave, Jonathan
Goodman, a spokesman for the Paris-based company, said. The
shares gained the most in almost five months.  Peugeot in total is now aiming to shrink its French
automotive operations by 11,200 positions, or 17 percent, over
the next two years. The automaker is also closing a factory on
the outskirts of Paris, selling assets and negotiating a
strategic alliance with  General Motors Co. (GM)  as  Europe ’s auto
market drops this year to the lowest sales volume since 1995.  “Whatever happens, the company will continue to suffer
from overcapacity at least until 2015,” said Florent Couvreur,
an analyst at CM-CIC Securities in Paris who recommends selling
the shares. “The most difficult year for PSA will be 2013 and
not 2012 because in 2012 they still had some assets to sell.”  Peugeot is selling a 75 percent stake in its Gefco trucking
unit to OAO Russian Railways for 800 million euros ($1.04
billion) and has also sold its headquarters in Paris.  Workers were told yesterday that the number of employees
that the automaker has in France will drop to 55,900 in 2014 as
a result of the latest round of cuts, Christian Lafaye, the
leader of the FO union, said in an interview. The total
headcount reduction in the next two years includes 1,700 cuts
announced in 2011 that haven’t been fully implemented, spokesman
Jean-Baptiste Mounier said by phone.  Shares Surge  The shares  surged  as much as 40 cents, or 8.1 percent, to
5.33 euros, the biggest intraday gain since Jul. 19, and were up
6.4 percent as of 10:30 a.m. in Paris trading. The stock has
dropped 50 percent this year, valuing the automaker at 1.86
billion euros.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest carmaker, has
gained 54 percent in 2012, giving the German company a market
capitalization of 76 billion euros.  Peugeot, which has been depleting cash reserves in the last
year at a rate of 200 million euros per month, said in October
that net debt at the end of 2012 will total about 3 billion
euros, versus a prediction in July of 2.5 billion euros. Moody’s
Investors Service cut Peugeot’s long-term debt rating to three
levels below investment-grade on Oct. 10, adding pressure on its
banking unit, Banque PSA Finance.  Loan Guarantees  France’s government stepped in on Oct. 24 to bail out
Peugeot, guaranteeing as much as 7 billion euros in new bonds in
exchange for greater influence over company strategy.  France ’s
National Assembly late yesterday voted in favor of the
guarantees and the measure should be fully adopted on Dec. 19,
according to the parliament’s website.  The automaker needs the French state backing for the
banking unit to keep down borrowing costs and offer customers
competitive financing rates.  Competitors are also cutting back. GM announced this week
that it will shutter a factory in  Germany  as a result of the
region’s plunging sales, threatening 3,100 jobs. The shutdown,
the first of a car factory in the country since World War II, is
part of Detroit-based GM’s efforts to end losses by 2015 in
Europe, where it’s forecasting a deficit of as much as 1.8
billion in 2012.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  intends to shut three European plants, one
in  Belgium  and two in the U.K. The Dearborn, Michigan-based
company is forecasting European-division losses totaling $3
billion this year and next, and doesn’t expect a profit in the
region before the middle of this decade.  Factory Closings  Fiat SpA (F)  closed a car plant on the Italian island of Sicily
in late 2011. The Turin-based manufacturer, which is forecasting
a loss at its European operations of 700 million euros this
year, said last week that it will cut 1,500 jobs in  Poland .  Peugeot is working on the details of the strategic alliance
with GM, which is now the French automaker’s second-largest
shareholder, to build vehicles together and jointly purchase
parts and supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
