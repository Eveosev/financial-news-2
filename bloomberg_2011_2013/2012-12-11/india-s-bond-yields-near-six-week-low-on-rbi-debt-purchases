India ’s 10-year bond yields were
near a six-week low on optimism debt purchases by the central
bank will spur demand for the securities.  The Reserve Bank of India purchased 116.03 billion rupees
($2.1 billion) of government notes due in 2017, 2020, 2022 and
2026 at an open-market auction today, according to a statement
on its website. The RBI, which last lowered its repurchase  rate 
by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April, will next review
policy on Dec. 18.  “We expect the RBI to complete 1 trillion rupees of open-
market purchases” in the second half of the fiscal year through
March, Barclays Plc strategists Rohit Arora and Igor Arsenin
wrote in a research note today. “We recommend 10-year bonds in
anticipation of rate cuts starting next quarter.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes maturing in June 2022
was little changed at 8.18 percent in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The rate touched 8.17 percent on
Dec. 6, the lowest level since Oct. 29.  The RBI picked up 116.43 billion rupees of securities on
Dec. 4 at its first debt-buying auction since June. Today’s
purchases takes the total so far this fiscal year to 1.1
trillion rupees.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.66 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
