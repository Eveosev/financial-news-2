Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)  surged to the
highest in almost two months after CNBC’s David Faber said the
wireless high-speed  Internet company  is moving closer to a
transaction with Sprint Nextel Corp.  Sprint has held talks with Clearwire’s major investors to
buy their shares for $3 apiece, Faber said today. While an
agreement isn’t imminent, it could come before the end of the
year, he said.  Clearwire  rose  12 percent to $2.68, the highest intraday
price since Oct. 15, at 11:48 a.m. in New York. Sprint fell 0.8
percent to $5.62.  Acquiring Clearwire and its wireless airwave licenses would
give Sprint more capacity to offer high-speed Internet for
mobile-phone devices. Sprint is already Clearwire’s largest
shareholder and its biggest customer, through a deal in which it
leases Clearwire’s airwaves to serve its mobile-phone users.  Scott Sloat , a spokesman for Sprint declined to comment.
Mike DiGioia, a Clearwire spokesman wasn’t immediately available
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
