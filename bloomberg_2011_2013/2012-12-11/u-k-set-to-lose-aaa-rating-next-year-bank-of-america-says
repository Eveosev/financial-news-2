The U.K. is “highly likely” to
lose its AAA credit rating next year, according to  John Wraith ,
a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  While the nation currently has top rankings at Moody’s
Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, both
Moody’s and Fitch have set their outlooks to negative.
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said Dec. 5 the
 Office for Budget Responsibility  believes he will miss his
target to begin cutting debt as a percentage of gross domestic
product in 2015-16, a factor that Fitch said weakens support for
the rating.  “Logic suggests that the negative outlooks may be resolved
with a downgrade,” Wraith said at a press briefing today in
 London . It would be “no surprise” if that takes place in the
first quarter, he said.  U.K. government bonds will underperform U.S. Treasuries and
German bunds, he predicted. The extra yield investors demand to
hold 10-year gilts instead of similar-maturity Treasuries will
widen to around 33 basis points after a rating cut, Bank of
America predicts. The  spread  was 15 basis points at 5:15 p.m.
London time.  Credit-rating cuts don’t always signal that bond prices
will fall. French 10-year yields have dropped more than 100
basis points, or 1 percentage point, this year despite the
country losing its top rating with S&P and Moody’s.  About half the time, government bond yields move in the
opposite direction suggested by new ratings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg in June on 314 upgrades, downgrades and
outlook changes going back to 1974.  To contact the reporter on this story:
