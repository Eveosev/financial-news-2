New York and six other states said
they plan to sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for
violating federal law by failing to regulate methane emissions
from the oil and natural gas industry.  The EPA violated the Clean Air Act by failing to address
methane emissions in revised regulations this year, New York
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said today in a statement.  “Our coalition is putting EPA on notice that we are
prepared to sue to force action on curbing climate change
pollution from the oil and gas industry,” Schneiderman said.  The industry is the largest source of manmade methane
emissions in the U.S., according to New York. The EPA is leaving
almost 95 percent of these emissions uncontrolled, the state
said.  New York joined  Connecticut ,  Delaware ,  Maryland ,
 Massachusetts , Rhode Island and  Vermont  in sending a notice of
intent to sue to the EPA.  A spokesman for the agency didn’t return a phone message
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
