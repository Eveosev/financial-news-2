Indonesia ’s rupiah approached its
weakest level since 2009 on speculation companies are increasing
purchases of the dollar for year-end payments and after global
funds cut share holdings.  Government bonds  advanced.  Overseas investors sold $160 million more local stocks than
they bought this month through yesterday, following net sales of
$319 million in November, exchange data show. The central bank
maintained its benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 5.75
percent today, as predicted by all 21 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The nation’s  current-account deficit  this year may be
2.4 percent, the largest in data going back to 1997, Bank
Indonesia said in a statement today.  “It is difficult for the rupiah not to test its lows with
the current-account deficit reducing the supply of dollars in
the country,” said Rully Nova, a currency analyst at PT Bank
Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta. “ Bank Indonesia  cannot reduce
its rate despite stable inflation due to the  exchange rate .”  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,641 per dollar as of
4:02 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. The currency reached 9,715 earlier, near a
three-year low of 9,733 touched yesterday.  Bank Indonesia will remain in the market to guard the
rupiah, Governor Darmin Nasution said yesterday. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, held at 5.5 percent, the highest
since Oct. 30.  The  Finance Ministry  will conduct a  debt swap  today,
offering 6.13 percent bonds due in May 2028, it said in a
statement on its website, without providing specific details.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent securities maturing
in May 2022 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 5.37 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
