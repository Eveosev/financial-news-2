U.S. schoolchildren trailed Asian
peers on one of the largest international tests of math, science
and reading, highlighting a challenge to American competiveness.  Eight countries or regions including South Korea, Singapore
and  Hong Kong  outscored the U.S. in eighth-grade math, while
nine did in science, according to the 2011 test, called  Trends
in International Mathematics and Science Study . On a reading
exam, the U.S. lagged behind five. Some U.S. states such as
 Florida  and  Massachusetts  bucked the trend, shining in some
subjects.  The latest international results will add to complaints
from business and political leaders that the U.S. workforce is
losing its edge. While U.S. eighth-graders have shown no
meaningful improvement in math and science since 2007, Asian
counterparts have generally been ramping up their performance,
said Ina V. S. Mullis, an education professor at  Boston College ,
which administers the tests.  “The dramatically superior achievement of the Asian
countries is rather breathtaking,” Mullis, co-director of the
exams, said in a telephone interview. “Closing the gap is
really tough and probably isn’t going to happen anytime soon.”  The underperformance of U.S. students on international
tests helped inspire a 10-year effort to hold schools
accountable for improving performance under President  George W. Bush ’s No Child Left Behind law through state standardized
reading and math testing.  Florida Shines  Saying the law’s reliance on testing has led to a dumbing
down of education, President  Barack Obama  has excused two-thirds
of U.S. states from No Child Left Behind’s main rules after they
pledged to turn around low-performing schools and tie teacher
evaluations to student achievement.  On the latest round of international tests, nine U.S.
states sought to have results broken out separately.  In fourth-grade reading, where the U.S. has improved its
performance since the last test was given, Florida had among the
best scores, performing at the same level as top-achieving Hong
Kong,  Russia ,  Finland  and  Singapore . In the late 1990s, Florida
was near the bottom of the pack in fourth-grade U.S. reading
scores. The state was the only one in the U.S. to break out its
reading results.  Jeb Bush , governor of Florida from 1999 through 2007,
instituted a program that targeted kindergarten through third-
grade reading, requiring more academic training in kindergarten,
“reading coaches” to help tailor instruction and a policy of
holding back third-graders with the weakest skills.  Jeb Bush  The international test validated the state’s approach, said
Mary Laura Bragg, who ran Bush’s initiative and is now policy
director for Foundation for Excellence in Education, a
Tallahassee, Florida-based education advocacy group founded by
Bush.  Bush’s successors  Charlie Crist  and  Rick Scott  have built
on the program, adding such measures as a three-times-a-year
online assessment to catch readers who are falling behind, said
Mary Jane Tappen, a deputy chancellor at the Florida Division of
Public Schools.  “This is a result of a decade of very hard work,” Tappen
said in a telephone interview.  In eighth-grade science, only Singapore had a higher
average score than Massachusetts. The state, which has long had
chart-topping performance, developed new assessments and
standards in the 1990s.  63 Countries  The international math and science tests have been given
every four years since 1995. In the 2011 round, more than
600,000 children in 63 countries took the math and science exam,
which measured achievement in fourth and eighth-grades. About
300,000 students in 49 countries sat for the fourth-grade
reading test, called  Progress in International Reading Literacy
Study , given every five years since 2001.  In math, the test covers commonly taught subjects such as
geometry and algebra. In science, it covers biology, chemistry
and physics. In reading, top-performing students show they can
understand and interpret stories and articles of 800 to 1,000
words.  Students performing well on the latest exams tended to
start early on the subject and go to well-financed schools with
highly trained and satisfied teachers working in orderly
environments, researchers found. The children of parents with
higher levels of education performed better, as well.  Reaching Advanced  The tests’ results are reported on a 0 to 1,000-point
scale, with 500 representing the international average the first
year the test was given.  In math, U.S. eighth-graders on average scored 509 in 2011,
up one point from 2007 and 17 points since 1995. Top-performing
Korea averaged 613, up 32 points since 1995.  The difference between some country’s scores wasn’t enough
to be statistically significant, researchers said. On that
basis, U.S. eighth-grade math scores were worse than six
countries or regions including Singapore and  Japan  and no
different from seven, such as Israel, Finland and  England .  Asian countries outshined the U.S. in answering the
toughest questions.  Almost half of eighth-graders in  Taiwan , Singapore and
 South Korea  showed they could reach the “advanced” level in
math, meaning they could relate fractions, decimals and percents
to each other; understand algebra; and solve simple probability
problems. In the U.S., 7 percent met that standard.  “That is a pretty stark difference,” said Jack Buckley,
commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics.
“The highest-performing countries are in a whole different
league.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
