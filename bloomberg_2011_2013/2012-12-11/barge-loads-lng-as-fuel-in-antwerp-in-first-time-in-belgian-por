A barge loaded liquefied natural gas
as fuel for the first time in a Belgian port as emissions
regulations lead companies to consider changing ship fuels, the
Antwerp  Port Authority  said.  The  Argonon , operated by Deen Shipping BV, fueled up from a
truck on Dec. 5, the port authority said on its website today.
The port said itâ€™s working to make LNG available alongside
conventional fuels by 2015, when stricter sulfur-emission
regulations enter force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
