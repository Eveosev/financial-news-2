Gold, copper, silver, platinum and
palladium will outperform other commodities next year on easing
by the U.S. Federal Reserve and supply constraints, according to
Bank of America Corp.  Global economic growth will average 3.2 percent in 2013,
“modestly” supporting demand for raw materials, analysts led
by  Francisco Blanch  said in a report today. The so-called fiscal
cliff of automatic tax increases and budget cuts could tip the
U.S. economy into recession and “abrupt policy changes” in
 Europe  may cause “large commodity price swings,” the analysts
wrote. The bank is neutral on commodities, John Bilton, European
investment strategist, told reporters in London today.  “We expect large-scale policy easing by the Fed and the
ECB should push gold prices higher,” the analysts wrote,
forecasting gold prices at $2,000 an ounce for 2013 and $2,400
for the end of 2014. “A stronger Chinese economy will likely
lend support to supply constrained metals next year, and we
expect copper prices to average $7,750 a ton in the fourth
quarter of 2013.”  Commodities as tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index are down 2 percent this year, led by declines in coffee,
sugar and cotton. The gauge almost doubled in the three years to
2011 as central banks and governments around the world took
action to boost their economies hurt by the global financial
crisis in 2008.  Spot gold, up 9.2 percent in 2012, is rallying for a 12th
year as central banks join investors buying bullion to diversify
assets. Holdings in  exchange-traded products  are at a record,
data compiled by Bloomberg show, and central banks are also
adding to their holdings. Silver has “scope” for a 20 percent
rally from the current levels, the bank said.  Bank of America expects grain prices to ease gradually into
2013, while “precariously low inventories” can drive prices
higher at the start of the year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
