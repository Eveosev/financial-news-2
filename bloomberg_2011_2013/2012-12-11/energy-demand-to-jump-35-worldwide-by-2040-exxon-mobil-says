Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s
biggest oil producer by market value, raised its long-term
global energy-demand growth estimate to 35 percent from 32
percent as expanding populations in Africa and  India  use more
electricity.  Worldwide consumption of fuels to run power plants, trucks,
trains and airplanes will climb to the equivalent of 705
quadrillion British thermal units by 2040, compared with 522
quadrillion in 2010, the base year for Exxon’s forecasters, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in a  report  today.  Rising electricity use will be the primary driver of demand
growth, accounting for more than half the increase, Exxon said.
As the world’s population expands to about 9 billion in 2040,
more households and businesses will need power, according to the
report.  North America  is expected to become a net exporter of oil
and fuels derived from crude by around 2030, Exxon said.
Worldwide, oil demand will increase by 26 percent though 2040,
while natural gas and hydropower use will rise by 65 percent and
66 percent, respectively.  Nuclear power consumption will more than double globally
through 2040 and coal use will decline by 2 percent, Exxon said.
Demand for renewable energy sources, excluding biomass and
waste, will more than quadruple, outpacing growth for all other
energy sources, according to the report.  Exxon revises its long-term energy-demand outlook annually
to guide long-term investment decisions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
