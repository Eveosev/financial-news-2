STX Pan Ocean Co. (028670)  climbed the most
in four years in  Seoul  trading, leading gains by affiliates,
after MoneyToday said the shipping company’s parent was close to
selling a unit that makes offshore vessels.  Pan Ocean surged 15 percent, the most since Dec. 15, 2008,
to close at 3,255 won.  STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. (067250)  rose 7.2
percent and holding company STX Corp. advanced 4.1 percent.  STX Group may announce the sale of its 51 percent stake in
vessel-maker  STX OSV Holdings Ltd. (SOH)  to  Fincantieri SpA  “soon,”
MoneyToday said, citing unidentified officials familiar with the
deal. The report was posted on the news provider’s free website
today after being published on a subscription service Dec. 4.
The sale may raise about 800 billion won ($743 million), the
article said.  “Bets that the group’s financial risks will decline with
asset sales are driving shares up nicely today,” said Kang Dong Jin, a Seoul-based analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co.  STX Group said in January that it may sell the OSV stake as
it struggles with debts and a collapse in ship orders caused by
a global glut of vessels and slumping cargo rates. The group
declined to comment on the MoneyToday report when contacted by
 Bloomberg News  today.  Bloomberg reported the talks with Fincantieri in April. The
group agreed to sell 43 percent of its power-plant unit to
Tokyo-based  Orix Corp. (8591)  in October. The group is aiming to raise
a total of 2.5 trillion won from asset sales.  STX Engine Co. rose 6.4 percent today, while Seoul’s
benchmark Kospi Index was up 0.4 percent. OSV fell 0.7 percent
to S$1.445 at 2:30 p.m. in  Singapore .  Pan Ocean also gained after Shinyoung Securities Co. said
today the company may make an operating  profit  next year, its
first since 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
