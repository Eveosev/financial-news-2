Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI) ,
the provider of infrastructure for wireless communications,
issued $1.5 billion of senior secured debt in two parts to help
fund a tender offer.  The company, through its CC Holdings GS V LLC unit, sold
$500 million of 2.381 percent, five-year notes to yield 175
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $1
billion of 3.849 percent bonds maturing in April 2023 at a
relative yield of 220 basis points, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Proceeds will fund a tender offer for the company’s 7.75
percent senior secured securities due in 2017, and to redeem any
of the debt that remains outstanding, according to a company
statement. The rest of the proceeds will go toward a tender for
its 9 percent debentures due in 2015.  Crown Castle previously sold debt in October, issuing $1.65
billion of 5.25 percent, senior unsecured notes due in January
2023 to yield 363 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The bonds traded at 103.4 cents
on the dollar to yield 4.82 percent on Nov. 15, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Moody’s Investors Service grades the new bonds Baa3, the
lowest level of investment grade, the ratings company said today
in a statement. Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley managed the sale, Bloomberg data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
