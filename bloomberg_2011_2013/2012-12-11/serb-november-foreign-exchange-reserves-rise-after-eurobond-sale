Serbia’s foreign-exchange reserves
expanded by $636 million in November after the government sold
its second Eurobond in two months to secure funds for the first
part of 2013.  The official reserves rose to 10.65 billion euros ($13.8
billion) in November from 10.16 billion euros a month earlier,
Narodna Banka Srbije, the country’s central bank, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Net reserves, excluding the money commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , rose to 6.672 billion euros from 6.02 billion in October.  Serbia’s borrowing in foreign and domestic markets
generated 663 million euros in inflows on top of 30.3 million
euros in loans and donations.  Outflows included repayment of 104.9 million euros to the
IMF, 16.1 million euros to foreign creditors and 3.7 million
euros in old savings to Serbian citizens, while banks withdrew a
surplus of 74.8 million euros they held in mandatory reserve
accounts with the central bank.  Interbank foreign-currency trading dropped 12 percent on
the month to 1.65 billion euros in November, the month when the
dinar gained a nominal 0.6 percent against the euro. The 11-
month volume in interbank foreign-currency market stood at 16.1
billion euros, the bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
