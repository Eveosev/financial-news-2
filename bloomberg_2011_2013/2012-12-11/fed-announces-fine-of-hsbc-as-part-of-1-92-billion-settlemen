The  Federal Reserve  said it has
levied a $165 million penalty against HSBC Holdings Plc as part
of a $1.92 billion settlement announced yesterday.  The central bank said today in Washington that the “civil
money penalty is the largest the Federal Reserve has assessed as
a result of unsafe and unsound practices related to insufficient
compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering
requirements, and U.S. economic sanctions.”  HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank, agreed to pay the
funds to settle U.S. probes of money laundering in the largest
such accord ever. The settlement includes a deferred prosecution
agreement with the  U.S. Department of Justice , the London-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. HSBC also said it
expects to complete an undertaking with the U.K. Financial
Services Authority soon, without giving details.  The Fed issued a cease and desist order that addresses
inadequate oversight by HSBC of “anti- money laundering  controls
and U.S. dollar clearing practices used by the firm’s banking
subsidiaries in the United States and abroad.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
