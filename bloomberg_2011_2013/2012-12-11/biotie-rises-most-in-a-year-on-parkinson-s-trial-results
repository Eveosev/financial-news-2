Biotie Therapies Oyj (BTH1V) , the drugmaker
that developed an anti-alcoholism medicine with H. Lundbeck A/S,
rose the most in almost a year after it said a mid-stage trial
met its goals in helping patients with  Parkinson’s disease .  Biotie advanced almost 13 percent to close at 45 cents in
Helsinki. The gain was the biggest since Jan. 11, 2011.  The experimental medicine SYN115 showed “highly
significant” effects on Parkinson’s disease symptoms, and full
data from the mid-stage study of 420 patients will be disclosed
at upcoming medical conferences, Turku, Finland-based Biotie
said today in a statement.  “We are extremely pleased with the results of this
study,” Chief Executive Officer Timo Veromaa said in the
statement. “The rigor with which the study was conducted also
makes us optimistic that it may be considered a pivotal study
within the envisioned development program.”  SYN115 is licensed to Brussels-based  UCB SA (UCB) , which probably
will decide on the next steps for the drug in the first quarter
of next year, Veromaa said. Biotie can receive as much as $370
million if goals for the product are met, the company has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
