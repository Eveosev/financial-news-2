The strength of speculative-grade
bond covenants, which are written into the terms of debt
agreements as a means to protect investors, fell to a two-year
low in November, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  The average covenant score, in which 1 is the strongest and
5 the weakest, was 4.15 last month, the lowest since the rating
company began tracking the data in January 2011. Thirty percent
of the bonds issued in November were so-called covenant lite,
lacking such features as restricted payments and incurrence
stipulations, compared with a 17.2 percent historical average,
analysts led by Alexander Dill wrote in a report dated
yesterday.  “November issuance was the weakest since the start of our
covenant scoring,” the analysts wrote. “Abnormally light
issuance is often dominated by more creditworthy issuers with
weak covenants.”  The weakest sector was chemicals, according to the report,
with bonds from a unit of  Huntsman Corp. (HUN) , the third-biggest
producer of titanium dioxide, and Parma, Ohio-based  GrafTech
International Ltd. (GTI)  scoring the lowest possible grade.  November was the second consecutive month that Caa rated
bonds had weaker average scores than B rated bonds, the analysts
wrote. Lower-rated bonds normally have stronger covenant
packages since investors expect weaker credits to offer more
protection, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
