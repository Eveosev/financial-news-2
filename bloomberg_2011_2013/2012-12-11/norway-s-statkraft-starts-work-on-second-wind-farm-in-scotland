Statkraft AS, Norway’s biggest
utility, will invest about 70 million pounds ($113 million)
building its second onshore wind farm in  Scotland  as it seeks to
boost its position in the U.K. energy market.  Statkraft started building the 66.7-megawatt Berry Burn
wind farm near Inverness this week and plans to complete the
facility by early 2014 using turbines made by Germany’s Enercon
GmbH, the Oslo-based company said today in a statement.  The project, which will create 50 jobs during the
construction of 29  wind turbines , will help contribute to
Scotland’s goal to get all of its electricity from renewables by
2020, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
