China ’s  stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index down from a one-month high, after new yuan
lending missed economists’ forecasts.  Bank of Communications Co. dropped 1.1 percent and Poly
Real Estate Group Co. sank 2.1 percent from its highest close in
almost five months.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) , China’s biggest
producer of baijiu liquor by market value, advanced 1.8 percent
after saying its products meet government requirements.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 0.4 percent to 2,074.70
at the close, after rising yesterday to the highest level since
Nov. 7. The CSI 300 Index lost 0.6 percent to 2,258.50. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies traded in  Hong
Kong  slipped 0.2 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added
0.5 percent yesterday.  “The market needs to take a breather here after a decent
rally as some investors are doubtful about the magnitude of the
economic recovery based on the loan data,” said Wu Kan, a
Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “The market will probably continue to go
up after the consolidation given recent positive signs that the
economy is bottoming out.”  November factory output and retail sales data released on
the weekend beat economists’ estimates. Signs the economic
recovery is gathering momentum helped drive the Shanghai
Composite up by 6.3 percent through yesterday from Dec. 3, when
it closed at its lowest level since January 2009.  Trading Volumes  The Shanghai gauge is still down 5.7 percent this year, the
most among benchmark indexes in  Asia ’s largest stock markets.
The measure  trades  at 11.4 times reported earnings, compared
with 10.8 set on Dec. 3, the lowest level since at least 1997,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Shanghai Composite trading volumes were about 46 percent
higher than the 30-day daily average. Thirty-day  volatility  on
the gauge was at 16.8, compared with this year’s average of
16.9, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bank of Communications  sank 1.1 percent to 4.43  yuan . China
Minsheng Banking Corp., the nation’s first privately owned bank,
lost 1.7 percent to 6.90 yuan. Industrial Bank Co., part-owned
by a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, fell 1 percent to 14.04 yuan.  Banks extended 522.9 billion yuan ($84 billion) of local-
currency loans last month, the central bank reported today. That
compares with a 550 billion yuan median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists and 562.2 billion yuan in November
last year. Aggregate financing, an indicator designed to capture
other funding sources apart from the bank loans, was 1.14
trillion yuan in November, the lowest level since August.  Stock Rebound  A gauge of the Shanghai Composite’s  property  companies sank
1.3 percent, snapping an 11 percent rally in the past seven
days. Poly Real Estate, China’s second-largest developer by
market value, lost 2.1 percent to 12.14 yuan.  China Vanke Co. (000002) ,
the biggest, dropped 1.1 percent to 9.24 yuan.  The Chinese stock market will likely rebound early next
year because of stabilizing economic fundamentals and ample
liquidity, the China Securities Journal said in a commentary.  Xi Jinping, newly elected head of the Communist Party, said
the nation shouldn’t delay pushing for economic restructuring,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday, citing the
comments he made at a seminar in the southern city of Guangzhou
on Dec. 9.  Kweichow Moutai gained 1.8 percent to 202.31 yuan after
being suspended from trading yesterday. Product samples it sent
to three labs this year met government requirements, the liquor
maker said in a statement. Concerns over the levels of additives
in its products dragged the company’s shares down by 8 percent
last week.  Moutai led a gauge of consumer-staples companies in the  CSI
300 (SHSZ300)  to a 0.5 percent advance. The sub-index posted the biggest
advance among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups today.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 0.9 percent to $38.77 in
its fifth day of gains yesterday, the longest stretch of
increases since Oct. 18.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
