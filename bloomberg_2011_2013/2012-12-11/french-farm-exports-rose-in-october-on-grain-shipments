France ’s farm and food exports, the
world’s fifth-biggest by value, climbed in October as grain
shipments rose.  Exports increased 9.5 percent to 5.71 billion euros ($7.42
billion) from 5.21 billion euros in the same month a year
earlier, the Agriculture Ministry wrote in an online  report 
today. Grain shipments, excluding rice, rose to 771 million
euros from 705 million euros in October 2011, according to the
report. France is the European Union’s biggest grain exporter.  Farm products and food contributed to a current-account
surplus of 1.494 billion euros in October, rising from 1.388
billion euros in the same time last year. France imported 4.21
billion euros of agricultural goods and food in October, up from
3.83 billion euros a year earlier, the ministry said.  In the first 10 months of 2012, food and farm exports
increased to 47.96 billion euros from 46.86 billion euros in the
year-earlier period. The current-account surplus this year
through October widened to 9.51 billion euros, compared with
9.33 billion euros in 2011, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
