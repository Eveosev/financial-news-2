Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year
yields to a two-week high, as investors sought higher-yielding
assets and the  Federal Open Market Committee  began a two-day
meeting amid forecasts it will decide to buy more bonds to spur
the economy.  U.S. government debt  declined even as the Treasury sold $32
billion in three-year securities at a record low  yield  of 0.327
percent. The auction was the first of three note and bond sales
this week totaling $66 billion. Stocks rose as risk appetite
gained amid signs  Europe ’s fiscal crisis may ease.  “The onset of supply is one factor, as is a positive move
in the stock market,” said Dan Mulholland, head of U.S.
Treasury trading in the capital-markets unit of BNY Mellon Corp.
in New York. “The FOMC meeting is pretty critical.”  The benchmark 10-year note  yield  increased four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.65 percent at 5 p.m. in
 New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched
1.66 percent, the highest level since Nov. 27. The price of the
1.625 percent security due in November 2022 dropped 11/32, or
$3.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 23/32.  The  yield  on the current three-year security rose as much
as one basis point to 0.33 percent before closing little changed
at 0.32 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed as much as 1.1
percent after German investor confidence jumped and as  Greece 
drew enough bonds to a sovereign-debt buyback crucial to
unlocking aid from the  International Monetary Fund . The index
pared gains to 0.7 percent amid concern that a budget showdown
in  Washington  may push the  U.S. economy  into recession.  Treasury Supply  The U.S. will auction $21 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow
and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on Dec 13. The offerings will
raise $25.7 billion of new cash as maturing securities held by
the public total $40.2 billion, according to the Treasury.  At today’s three-year debt auction,  direct bidders , non-
primary-dealer investors that place their bids directly with the
Treasury, bought a record 24.8 percent of the notes. They
purchased an average of 12.5 percent at the past 10 sales.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of notes offered, was 3.36, versus
3.41 at the last sale.  Indirect Bidders  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 21.9 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 31.5 percent for the past 10 sales.  Primary dealers  bought 53.3 percent of the securities
today, the most since August.  The previous record-low yield at a three-year note auction
was 0.334 percent in September 2011. The securities yielded
0.392 percent at the Nov. 6 sale.  “It was a very good auction; it came where everyone
expected it,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New York
at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., which as a primary dealer
is obliged to bid at U.S. debt auctions. “The directs bought
more than the indirects, and we haven’t seen that before.
There’s a lot in play with the FOMC tomorrow and the fiscal-
cliff negotiations between the House and the president.”  Three-year notes have returned 0.6 percent this year,
compared with a 2.7 percent return for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Fed Meeting  The Fed will announce tomorrow after the policy meeting
that it will begin buying $45 billion in Treasuries each month,
pushing its balance sheet almost to $4 trillion, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  Forty-eight of 49 economists polled predict the FOMC will
purchase the securities to bolster an existing program to buy
$40 billion in mortgage bonds each month. Policy makers pledged
in October to continue that plan until the labor market improves
“substantially.”  A program known as  Operation Twist , in which the Fed sells
shorter-maturity Treasuries and buys longer-dated debt, is due
to expire at the end of the month. As part of the plan, the
central bank purchased $1.4 billion of Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities today maturing from January 2021 to
February 2042.  Treasuries fell earlier as the ZEW Center for European
Economic Research said its index of German investor and analyst
expectations, which is designed to predict economic developments
six months in advance, climbed to 6.9 this month from minus 15.7
in November.  Bondholders tendered Greek bonds with a face value of more
than 31 billion euros ($40 billion), a Finance Ministry official
said. The official asked not to be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak publicly.  The U.S. faces a fiscal cliff of $607 billion in automatic
spending cuts and tax increases starting Jan. 1 if lawmakers
can’t reach agreement. The  Congressional Budget Office  has said
the stalemate probably would lead to a recession in the first
half of 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
