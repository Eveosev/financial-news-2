The European Union is studying
whether national regulators broke EU rules by taking steps to
stop banks from moving funds across the bloc’s internal borders.  The European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s executive arm,
is “looking into this and monitoring closely what is
happening,” Stefaan De Rynck, a spokesman for Michel Barnier,
the EU’s financial services chief, said in an e-mail. The  Wall
Street Journal  reported today that the EU was considering taking
steps against national regulators that restrict banks from
freely moving funds.  German and Italian regulators clashed over a move by
 Unicredit SpA (UCG)  to allocate funds raised from German depositors to
its central Italian unit, and the U.K. Financial Services
Authority has pressured the U.K.-based units of EU banks to
change their legal structure so that the FSA can set capital
requirements, the Wall Street Journal reported.  “All supervisors concerned should talk to each other and
cooperate with a view to respecting free movement of capital and
the single market for banking,” De Rynck said. “These are
fundamental matters.”  The European Banking Authority also has the power to step
in and investigate cases where regulators may have unfairly
blocked banks from moving funds, De Rynck said. The EBA can
mediate disputes between supervisors, he said.  “We are following the actions taken by national
supervisors, both procedurally in terms of their duty to
cooperate with each other in the EU, and in terms of substantive
actions taken,” De Rynck said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
