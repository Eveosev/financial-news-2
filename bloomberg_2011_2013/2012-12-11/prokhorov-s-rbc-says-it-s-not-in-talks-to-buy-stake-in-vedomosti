OAO RBC, the media holding company
of Russian billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , isn’t in talks to
acquire  Sanoma Oyj (SAA1V) ’s stake in newspaper  Vedomosti , Derk Sauer,
president of RBC, said.  Russian business daily Kommersant reported today that RBC
is seeking to buy a 33 percent stake in a Cyprus-based company
which owns Vedomosti, a business daily which is published
jointly with the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times,
citing unidentified people.  “We at RBC are not involved in any talks on the matter,
there is no substance for these press reports,” said Sauer, the
founder of Sanoma Independent Media, who was  hired  last month by
Prokhorov to run RBC.  Russian media assets have been consolidated by businessmen
with ties to President  Vladimir Putin  in recent years.
Billionaire Yuri Kovalchuk’s  National Media Group , part-owned by
 RTL Group SA (RTL) , runs three television channels and broadsheet
Izvestia. Billionaire  Alisher Usmanov  controls Kommersant.  OAO
Gazprom  runs two TV stations.  Alternatively,  Pearson Plc (PSON) , which publishes the FT, may
consolidate 100 percent of Vedomosti, Kommersant reported.
Sanoma, Pearson and  News Corp. (NWSA) , which runs the Wall Street
Journal, currently each own a third of Vedomosti.  “Pearson has long been an active investor in Vedomosti and
we will continue to do so,” spokesman Charles Goldsmith said
today in a phone interview.  Robin Janszen, a spokesman for Sanoma in Helsinki, declined
to comment on the Kommersant report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
