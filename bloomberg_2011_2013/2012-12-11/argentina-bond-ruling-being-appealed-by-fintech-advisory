Fintech Advisory Inc., a New York
investment advisory firm that holds restructured Argentine debt,
filed a notice that it is appealing a federal judge’s rulings in
litigation over the country’s defaulted bonds.  U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in  Manhattan  ruled Nov.
21 that Argentina had to pay the $1.3 billion, which is claimed
by holders of the defaulted debt, into an escrow account by Dec.
15 if it made about $3 billion in scheduled payments on the
restructured debt this month. The rulings sparked a rout in
Argentine bonds and caused Fitch to cut ratings on the country’s
debt.  In a two-page court filing in Manhattan federal court
yesterday, Fintech, which is not a party in the case, said it is
appealing the orders.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York delayed the effect of
Griesa’s orders and set Feb. 27 for oral argument in the case.  The case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of  Argentina ,
12-105, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
