  Tecnisa SA (TCSA3) , the worst-performing
homebuilder this quarter in Brazil, fell for the first time in
almost two weeks after the company declined at its annual
meeting to give estimates for 2013 projects.  The shares fell 0.4 percent to 8.12 reais at close in Sao
Paulo, the biggest drop on a closing basis since Nov. 29. The
BM&FBovespa Real Estate index slid 1 percent.  The homebuilder told analysts at a meeting today in Sao
Paulo that it won’t make estimates for new projects next year,
said Wesley Bernabe, an analyst at  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  who
attended the meeting in Sao Paulo.  “Without guidance for projects, it is more difficult for
investors to forecast  cash flow  correctly,”  Bernabe (BNBC)  said in a
telephone interview.  A Tecnisa press officer declined to comment and asked not
to be named in accordance with the Sao Paulo-based company’s
policy.  Tecnisa yesterday reduced its forecast for new projects in
2012 to 1 billion reais ($481 million) from 1.4 billion reais.  The company’s shares lost 14 percent this quarter through
yesterday, compared with a 0.2 percent gain in the real estate
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
