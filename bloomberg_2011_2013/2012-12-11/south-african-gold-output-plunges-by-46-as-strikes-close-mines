South African  gold output  plunged by
46 percent in October as a wave of labor strikes in the country
idled the continent’s biggest mines.  Iron-ore production fell 23 percent and chrome 19 percent
after unrest in platinum mining spread. Statistics SA released
the production  statistics  today on its website.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. and Gold Fields Ltd., the world’s
third and fourth-largest gold producers, were forced to close
all their local mines in October because of strikes. The unrest
will probably cost the economy about half a percentage point of
growth, National Treasury Director General Lungisa Fuzile said.  Workers at Lonmin Plc, the world’s third-largest producer
of the metal, ended a six-week strike on Sept. 20 after being
awarded pay increases of 11 percent to 22 percent.  South
Africa ’s inflation rate was 5.5 percent that month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
