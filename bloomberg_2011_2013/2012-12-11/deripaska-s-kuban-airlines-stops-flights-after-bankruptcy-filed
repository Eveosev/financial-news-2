Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s
 Kuban Airlines (ALIK) , the country’s  14th biggest , declared bankruptcy
and ceased flying today after running up debt and breaching
federal regulations.  “The main reasons for stopping the airline’s operations
are the difficult financial situation and failure to comply with
a number of provisions mandated by new federal aviation rules,”
Krasnodar-based Kuban Airlines said in a  statement  on its
website. The carrier filed for bankruptcy at the Krasnodar
Region Arbitration Court.  Under new rules that went into effect at the end of
November, airlines must operate at least eight aircraft seating
55 and more. Kuban Airlines, controlled by Deripaska’s Basic
Element, flew six planes and three of them had to be returned to
leasing companies because of unpaid arrears and failure to make
timely payments, according to the airline’s statement.  The carrier had debt and payments that were overdue to air-
navigation service providers, airports and refueling companies,
the country’s aviation agency,  Rosaviatsia , said on its website.
Kuban Airlines had total debt of about $300 million, the
Vedomosti newspaper reported today.  The exact amount of debt will be determined after the
regulator completes an inspection tomorrow, Sergey Izvolsky, a
spokesman for Rosaviatsia, said by phone.  Kuban Airlines has sold more than 14,500 tickets for
flights until March and some of its stranded passengers will be
picked up by other airlines, according to Rosaviatsia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
