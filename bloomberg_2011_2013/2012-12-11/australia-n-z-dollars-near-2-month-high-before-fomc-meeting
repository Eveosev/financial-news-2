The  New Zealand dollar  touched the
strongest in five weeks against its Australian counterpart after
house prices in the smaller country rose last month at the
fastest annual pace in five years and card spending increased.  Australia ’s dollar declined against all 16 major peers
after business confidence dropped to the lowest since 2009. The
South Pacific nations’ currencies were supported against the
 U.S. dollar  amid bets the  Federal Reserve  will add to monetary
stimulus which tends to debase the greenback at its policy
meeting starting today.  “‘The recent data out of New Zealand has supported the
case for the  Reserve Bank  to maintain its neutral bias and not
cut  interest rates ,’’ said  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at
Bank of  New Zealand  in Wellington ‘‘That’s helping the kiwi
dollar outperform.’’  New Zealand’s currency rose 0.1 percent to 83.54 U.S. cents
as of 4:40 p.m. in Sydney, after earlier touching 83.55, the
highest since Sept. 28. It was little changed at 68.77 yen.
Australia’s dollar fell to NZ$1.2535, the lowest since Nov. 5,
before trading at NZ$1.2548, 0.1 percent below yesterday’s
close. The Aussie bought $1.0482 from $1.0488 yesterday. On Dec.
6, it reached $1.0516, the highest since Sept. 21. It slid 0.1
percent to 86.29 yen.  Australian  government bonds  rose, with the 10-year yields
dropping two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.13
percent.  House Prices  The Real Estate Institute of New Zealand said  house prices 
climbed 7.3 percent in November from a year earlier, the fastest
annual pace since November 2007. The value of transactions on
electronic cards rose 0.5 percent from October, when it gained
0.4 percent, the statistics bureau said today in Wellington.
Core spending, which excludes sales at fuel outlets, car dealers
and parts stores, increased 1 percent, the biggest advance in
seven months.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, an indication of what
traders expect the central bank’s key interest rate will average
during the period, was little changed at 2.713 percent.  The kiwi dollar has jumped 5.8 percent this year, the best
performer among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Index. The Australian dollar has
gained 0.5 percent over the same period.  The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meets for the last
time this year today and tomorrow. It will consider whether to
expand purchases of assets after its so-called Operation Twist
program of swapping $45 billion a month in short-term Treasuries
for long-term debt expires this month.  ‘‘We’re expecting the Fed to announce another asset-
purchase scheme this week,” said  Bank of New Zealand ’s Jones.
“That’s likely to maintain downward pressure on the U.S. dollar
and allow the kiwi and the Aussie to keep rising.”  Business Confidence  The Australian currency weakened after a private report
showed business confidence plunged last month. National
Australia Bank Ltd. said its confidence index dropped to minus 9
from minus 1 in October, the lowest since April 2009, citing a
survey of more than 600 companies taken Nov. 19-27. The business
conditions gauge, a measure of hiring, sales and profits, held
at minus 5, the weakest level since May 2009.  The  Reserve Bank of Australia  reduced its benchmark
interest rates on Dec. 3 by 25 basis points to 3 percent.
 Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders see
a 54 percent chance the central bank will cut again to 2.75
percent when it next meets Feb. 5. That compares with 50 percent
chance indicated a week ago.  “While we pencil in one final cut in mid-2013, today’s
poor report does, at the margin, increase the chance that the
RBA may have to act sooner rather than later,” Alvin Pontoh, a
strategist at TD Securities Inc. in  Singapore , wrote in a
research note today. “The fact that business confidence
continues to deteriorate despite lower interest rates does
suggest that business are slow to respond to easier monetary
policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
