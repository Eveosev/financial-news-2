Job openings in the U.S. rose to a
four-month high in October, showing companies kept expanding in
the face of looming tax increases and budget cuts.  The number of  positions  waiting to be filled rose by
128,000 to 3.68 million from the prior month, the Labor
Department said today in Washington. The trade deficit widened
as exports slumped the most in four years, other figures showed.  More openings lay the groundwork for the accelerated job
growth needed to bolster consumer spending, which accounts for
about 70 percent of the economy. Employment gains so far have
failed to satisfy Federal Reserve policy makers, who are meeting
today and tomorrow to consider further easing to spur the
economy.  “The labor market is healing gradually,” said Michael Gapen, a New York-based senior economist at Barclays Plc.
“Policy makers would like to see more. We’re having more of the
same -- moderate growth and moderate improvement in the labor
market.”  Stocks rose after German investor confidence climbed and
amid speculation progress was being made in talks in Washington
to avoid more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and
tax increases set to take effect next year. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.7 percent to 1,427.84 at the close in
New York.  German investor sentiment increased to a seven-month high
in December on speculation  Europe ’s largest economy will gain
momentum next year. The ZEW Center for European Economic
Research in Mannheim said its index of investor and analyst
expectations, which aims to predict economic developments six
months in advance, rose to 6.9 from minus 15.7 in November.  Monthly Figures  Today’s U.S. Labor Department report on job openings and
separations helps show the dynamics behind the monthly
employment figures.  The job market withstood the impact of superstorm Sandy in
November, Labor Department figures showed on Dec. 7. Payrolls
rose by 146,000 in November following a revised 138,000 advance
in October that was less than initially estimated. The median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey called for an
85,000 advance. Private payrolls, which exclude government
agencies, grew by 147,000 after a revised gain of 189,000.  The jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent as
people left the labor force, the Labor Department also reported
last week.  Today’s report showed job openings in the Northeast were up
8,000 in October, while hiring dropped 101,000. Superstorm Sandy
swept ashore in the region on Oct. 29.  Storm’s Impact  For establishments in the storm-affected region that failed
to respond to the survey and which met certain criteria, the
Labor Department said that it assumed there were no job openings
and that the business was closed. “There were very few
establishments subject to the special procedures,” the agency
said.  In the U.S., the number of people hired rose to 4.34
million in October, pushing up the hiring rate to 3.2 percent
from 3.1 percent, today’s report showed.  Openings in construction, manufacturing, the leisure and
hospitality industry and retailers contributed to the pickup in
available employment. Openings in education and health services
cooled.  Macy’s Inc. (M) , the second-biggest U.S. department-store
chain, said it would add about 2,000 more workers than the
78,000 it hired last year for the holiday shopping season. Toys
‘R’ Us Inc., the world’s largest toy retailer, reported plans to
employ 45,000 temporary staff, up 5,000 from the 2011 season.  Job Openings  Considering the 12.26 million Americans who were  unemployed 
in October, today’s figures indicate there are about 3.3 people
vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the recession
began in December 2007.  Total firings, which exclude retirements and those who left
their job voluntarily, decreased to 1.66 million from 1.73
million a month before.  In the 12 months ended in October, the economy created a
net 1.9 million jobs, representing 51.7 million hires and about
49.8 million separations.  The Commerce Department today said the trade gap in October
widened 4.9 percent to $42.2 billion from a revised $40.3
billion in September. Exports declined 3.6 percent, the most
since January 2009.  The decrease in  exports  may have been exacerbated by a drop
in the sale of soybeans caused by a drought in the Midwest. The
decline was nonetheless broad-based, indicating cooling
economies from Europe to Asia may be sapping demand for American
goods, once a mainstay of the economic recovery.  Industrial Machinery  Foreign purchases of engines, industrial machinery, and
petroleum products were among the other categories that also saw
decreases. Superstorm Sandy, which closed ports in New Jersey in
late October and early November, may have contributed to the
decline.  Imports declined 2.1 percent to $222.8 billion, the lowest
level since April 2011, from $227.6 billion in the prior month,
led by a $1.32 billion plunge in mobile phones, today’s report
showed. The decrease followed a surge in September that
coincided with the introduction of the latest Apple Inc. iPhone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
