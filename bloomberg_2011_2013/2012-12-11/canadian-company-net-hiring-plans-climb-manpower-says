Canadian employers boosted their net
hiring plans for the start of next year led by transportation
and public utilities, according to a survey by  Manpower Inc. (MAN)   The share of companies planning to hire between January and
March exceeded those forecasting cutbacks by 13 percentage
points after adjusting for seasonal variations, the Milwaukee-
based employment-services firm said in a statement. The so-
called net employment figure rose from 11 in the last survey.  Canada’s  jobless rate  has exceeded 7 percent since the
start of 2009 during Canada’s last recession and will be 7.2
percent next year according to economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News .  The Manpower report showed a seasonally adjusted net hiring
outlook of 21 percent for transportation and public utilities.
That was followed by a positive 16 percent for service companies
and construction. Non-durable manufacturing was the least
optimistic with a net outlook of 6 percent.  The survey of 1,900 Canadian employers generates results
that are accurate within 2.2 percentage points, Manpower said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
