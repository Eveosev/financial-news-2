Landry’s Inc., owner of the
Rainforest Cafe and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. chains, will look at
more casino, hotel and restaurant acquisitions next year.  “We’re always in deal mode and I would be shocked if we
don’t do something” in 2013, Chief Executive Officer Tilman Fertitta said in a phone interview today. The Houston-based
company last month announced it purchased the Isle Casino in
Biloxi,  Mississippi .  Fertitta also said that the gaming and restaurant
industries are not seeing the growth that they had earlier this
year. He is the sole owner of Landry’s, which also owns Morton’s
steakhouse and Golden Nugget hotels and casinos.  “The whole business world is a little scared right now
since we re-elected Barack” Obama, he said. “It’s definitely
soft out there.”  At Landry’s, revenue will increase about 10 percent in
2013, compared with this year, because of new restaurant and
casino locations, he said.  “The restaurant industry is choppy, where it had been kind
of on a roll,” Fertitta said. “We’re not getting the growth
that we had, and I think that’s kind of where the whole economy
is right now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
