Swaps prices rose for thermal coal
from  Indonesia , the world’s largest exporter of the power-
station fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the first
quarter of 2013 climbed 15 cents to $62.50 a metric ton on a
net-as-received basis yesterday, Ginga said in an e-mail today.
The January contract gained 15 cents to $62.50 a ton.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the first
quarter declined 25 cents to $84.05 a ton on a net-as-received
basis, the energy broker said. The swap for January also fell 25
cents to $84.05.  Thermal coal price at  Australia ’s Newcastle port, the
benchmark for Asian contracts, rose $3.55, or 4.1 percent, to
$90.65 a ton in the week ended Dec. 7, according to IHS
McCloskey, a Petersfield, U.K.-based provider of coal data. The
increase for a seventh week marked the longest streak of gains
since February.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with better-quality stock.
Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100 per kilogram,
according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
