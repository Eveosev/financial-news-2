The euro may drop toward its lowest
level in almost four weeks versus the yen, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said, citing trading patterns.  The euro’s weekly candlestick chart against the yen
indicates its recent advance is “stalling,” according to
 MacNeil Curry , the bank’s New York-based head of foreign-
exchange and interest-rates technical strategy. The 17-nation
currency’s relative strength index rose to 74 on Dec. 5, data
compiled by Bloomberg show, above the 70 level that some traders
see as a sign an asset is about to change direction.  In the long term, euro-yen is turning “from bearish to
bullish,” Curry wrote in a report yesterday. “But for now the
risk is for a correction lower to 103.00/101.68.”  Europe ’s shared currency added 0.1 percent to 106.64 yen as
of 9:35 a.m. in  Tokyo  after climbing to 107.96 on Dec. 5, the
highest since April 20. It last touched 101.68 on Nov. 14, when
it fell to as low as 100.83.  Candlesticks consist of a body, which is black or white,
and upper and lower wicks. A wick shows the highest or lowest
price. If a currency’s close is lower than it’s open, the body
is black.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
