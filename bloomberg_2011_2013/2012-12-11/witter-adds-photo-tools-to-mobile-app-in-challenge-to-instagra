Twitter Inc. unveiled tools to
adjust the color, size and style of photos uploaded via
applications for  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones and Android phones, as the
social-media site adds features to compete with  Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s
Instagram.  The photo filters, developed in partnership with software
maker Aviary Inc., are part of an update to the mobile apps made
available yesterday, San Francisco-based Twitter said in a  blog
post .  Twitter is letting users add pictures, video and audio to
their postings as it steps up competition with Facebook, which
bought photo-sharing service Instagram earlier this year. Last
week, Instagram disabled a feature called Twitter cards for
showcasing photos and other media. The move was seen as a step
that better prepares Instagram for generating revenue from its
own services by driving traffic to its website.  Twitter’s updated photo-enhancing apps will probably bring
more exposure to Aviary, a New York-based startup with backing
from  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  founder Jeff Bezos and LinkedIn Corp. co-
founder  Reid Hoffman .  To contact the reporter on this story:
