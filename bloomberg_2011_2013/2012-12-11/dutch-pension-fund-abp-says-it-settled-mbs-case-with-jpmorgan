Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, the
biggest Dutch retirement fund, said it settled a lawsuit with
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  over sales of residential mortgage-backed
securities.  “ABP is very content to have reached this settlement and
is pleased that JPMorgan was willing to reach a mutually
satisfactory conclusion of this litigation,” the Heerlen,
Netherlands-based fund said today in an e-mailed statement.
Harmen Geers, a spokesman for ABP, declined to comment on the
amount of the settlement.  The suit, filed in state court in  Manhattan  in December
2011, accused the bank of negligent misrepresentation, alleging
the sales were based on false and misleading statements. New
York-based JPMorgan has denied and continues to deny these
claims, ABP said in today’s statement. A JPMorgan spokesman
declined immediate comment when called by  Bloomberg News .  ABP has sued other banks in the same court over similar
allegations, including Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG,
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ABP serves as the
pension fund for Dutch public educational and government workers
and had about 274 billion euros ($356 billion) of available
assets at the end of the third quarter.  The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. JPMorgan Chase &
Co., 653383/2011,  New York  State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
