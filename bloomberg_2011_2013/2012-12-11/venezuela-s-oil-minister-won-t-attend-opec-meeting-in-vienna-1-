Venezuela ’s Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez won’t attend the OPEC meeting this week in Vienna, an
official at the ministry said today, asking not to be identified
in line with department policy.  Ramirez said yesterday he would send Bernard Mommer, the
OPEC representative for Venezuela’s oil ministry, in his place
so he could support President Hugo Chavez, who is undergoing
cancer surgery in Cuba, Venezuela’s Noticias24 reported.  Venezuela didn’t believe it was necessary for OPEC to
increase production quotas and that the market was
“sufficiently” supplied, Noticias24 quoted Ramirez as saying.
He said some countries had been violating quotas and called for
“discipline and unity,” the news website reported.  Kuwait’s Oil Minister Hani Abdulaziz Hussein won’t attend
the meeting this week either, an official in the oil ministry
said yesterday.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporters on this story:
