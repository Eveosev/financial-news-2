The European Union,  Germany  and the
U.K. will sell 819 million metric tons of carbon permits for the
third phase of the bloc’s greenhouse-gas market next year,
according to the program’s regulator.  The 27-member region will hold sales three times a week on
behalf of 24 states,  Iceland , Norway,  Poland  and Liechtenstein,
the EU said today in a statement on its  website . The U.K. and
Germany will each hold one separate sale every week. The
auctions will be hosted by the European Energy Exchange AG, ICE
Futures Europe and a platform yet to be appointed for Poland,
according to the European Commission.  Nations will sell on average nearly half the permits issued
in the bloc’s market each year from 2013 through 2020, according
to the rules of the system.  The EU will also resume sales of aviation carbon permits
starting in May, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
