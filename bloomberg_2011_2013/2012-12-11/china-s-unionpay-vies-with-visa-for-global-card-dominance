Among the designer brands from  Prada (1913) 
to Chanel at the  Harrods flagship store  in London, Chinese
housewife Li Yafang spotted a logo she knows from back home: the
red, blue and green of UnionPay cards.  “It’s very convenient that I can now use my  UnionPay
card ” to shop abroad instead of carrying a stack of cash, said
the 39-year-old, who was buying the same 1,190-pound ($1,920)
Prada Saffiano Lux handbag carried by the hit woman in the
“Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol” movie. “I hope more
places abroad will accept UnionPay.”  Her wish is becoming reality as  UnionPay , founded 10 years
ago in Shanghai by the State Council and central bank, extends
its reach. With more plastic in circulation than any other
payment network -- 2.9 billion cards, or 45 percent of the
world’s total last year -- UnionPay is now accepted in  135
countries . Its rise is causing friction as the firm grabs market
share from  Visa Inc. (V)  as well as  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , which UnionPay
surpassed in customer spending in the first half of the year.  “UnionPay has absolute dominance in China, and it’s now
expanding beyond that to become a top global player,” James Friedman, a New York-based analyst at Susquehanna International
Group LLP who covers payments firms including Visa, said in a
telephone interview. “Their numbers show they are already in
the league of Visa and MasterCard.”  WTO Challenge  A case brought by the U.S. government to the  World Trade
Organization  and ruled on in July challenged China’s requirement
that foreign card issuers -- including  Citigroup Inc. (C) , which in
August became the first Western bank in China to issue solely
branded credit cards -- must use UnionPay’s network for yuan-
denominated transactions.  The rules, along with those requiring all Chinese automated
teller machines and merchants to use its network, prompted the
WTO to  order  that China stop discriminating against foreign
payment companies.  The decision didn’t spell out specific measures, and the
WTO also ruled against the U.S. claim that UnionPay is an
“across-the-board monopoly.”  “It’s difficult to say which side won after reading the
WTO ruling as you basically can’t tell what’s actually going to
happen,” Susquehanna’s Friedman said.  A 2005 linkup with  Discover Financial Services (DFS)  gave
UnionPay access to a network that now reaches about the same
number of U.S. merchants as Visa and MasterCard. On Nov. 30, the
firm set up UnionPay International Co. to  expand  further. More
than 10 million UnionPay cards have been issued by 65 lenders in
17 countries outside China, according to the company’s  website .  Chinese Shoppers  Chinese shoppers have overtaken Americans this year as the
world’s biggest buyers of  luxury goods , accounting for 25
percent of global sales through purchases at home and overseas,
according to a report released today by consultancy firm Bain &
Co. Some 60 percent of such purchases by Chinese shoppers
happened outside the mainland, the report found.  Debit-card transactions drive most of UnionPay’s revenue.
Its share of combined credit- and debit-card purchase volume for
the first half of 2012 rose to 23.8 percent from 20.9 percent a
year earlier, propelling UnionPay to No. 2 globally behind Visa,
while MasterCard’s climbed to 21.7 percent from 21.5 percent,
according to the  Nilson Report , an industry newsletter. Visa’s
fell to 46 percent from 48.9 percent.  The share of spending volume at  American Express Co. (AXP) , which
UnionPay supplanted in 2010 as the third-biggest network by
transactions processed, slid to 7.2 percent from 7.5 percent.  UnionPay cards issued by banks rose 22 percent in 2011 from
a year earlier to 2.9 billion, according to the Carpinteria,
California-based newsletter. Visa cards rose 4 percent to 2.3
billion, Nilson said.  ‘Compete Vigorously’  Visa’s relationship with its Chinese competitor is similar
to that of other firms, Jeff Liao, head of Visa China, said in
an e-mailed statement. The Foster City, California-based company
has provided technology to help China’s payments industry and
worked with UnionPay and the government on industry training
programs, he said.  “We compete vigorously, but we also cooperate as
appropriate on common industry issues,” Liao said.  James Issokson, a MasterCard spokesman, declined to
comment. UnionPay doesn’t publish financial statements and
interviews with its executives couldn’t be arranged, said Wang
Kongping, a company spokesman.  “If you look forward, the world has a new player that
wants to be involved,” Diane Offereins, head of payment
services at Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover, said in an
interview in Beijing in August. “We do see them making good
progress in building that international network.”  Record Spending  Chinese residents increased spending abroad through credit
and  debit cards  last year by 67 percent to 300 billion  yuan  ($48
billion),  China Daily   quoted  UnionPay Chairman Su Ning as saying
in March.  Chinese  spent  a record $7.7 billion on shopping in the U.S.
last year, according to U.S. Commerce Department data. Their
purchases climbed at least 30 percent annually in seven of the
past eight years, the data show.  “Total transaction volume from UnionPay cards outside of
China may not be so significant yet, but it’s a game about
future opportunities,” Friedman said.  Domestically, UnionPay dominates the payments market. Its
Chinese name, Yin Lian, which means “banks united,” also
reflects its ownership structure. Its founding shareholders in
2002 were 85 Chinese banks, led by the five biggest state-owned
lenders and approved by the State Council and the People’s Bank
of China.  Chinese Leaders  Its largest bank shareholder is China Construction Bank
Corp., with a 4.9 percent stake.  Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China Ltd. , Agricultural  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  and Bank of
Communications Co. each hold more than 3 percent, data compiled
by Susquehanna show.  UnionPay’s top managers, including Chairman Su and
President  Xu Luode , are former senior officials at China’s
central bank. UnionPay boasts on its website visits by Chinese
leaders such as President  Hu Jintao , Premier  Wen Jiabao  and  Xi Jinping , the incoming president.  Xu, in a 2009 interview in New York with  Bloomberg News ,
said his goal was for UnionPay to be accepted around the globe.
“My next step isn’t any nation,” he said. “It’s the world.”  UnionPay’s 2011 profit rose about 78 percent to 1.07
billion yuan, on revenue of 6 billion yuan, China Business News
 reported  in April, citing data from the company’s shareholder
meeting. Over the past four years, UnionPay’s revenue has more
than tripled while profit increased almost 11-fold, according to
the report.  Merchant Commissions  The company gets about half its revenue from commissions
paid by domestic merchants, the 21st Century Business Herald
 reported  in July, without saying where it obtained the
information. The rest is from fees on domestic ATM withdrawals,
international operations and other businesses, the newspaper
said, without giving a breakdown.  The only non-mainland Chinese banks allowed to issue solely
branded credit cards in the country are Hong Kong-based  Bank of
East Asia Ltd.  and New York-based Citigroup. Citigroup’s ability
to get an issuing license was “a meaningful development for
U.S. bank issuers,” Craig Maurer and Matthew O’Neill, analysts
at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, wrote in a Sept. 19 note.  Other lenders, including London-based  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
issue cards co-branded with Chinese banks. They typically pay a
cut of each transaction to the Chinese partner as well as to
UnionPay, whose network must be used for domestic payment
processing. Visa’s logo is now printed on cards issued by at
least 16 Chinese banks, including  Bank of China Ltd.  and Bank of
Communications, according to its Chinese-language website.  ‘Easy Access’  MasterCard, whose Chinese name means “easy access to
everything,” has 18 Chinese lenders issuing cards with its
brand, its website shows. The Purchase, New York-based company
signed a memorandum of understanding with UnionPay in 2010 to
boost its revenue by improving acceptance in China for
MasterCard and outside of the country for UnionPay cardholders.  AmEx has co-branded credit cards with UnionPay issued by
four Chinese lenders including Bank of China and ICBC, according
to the New York-based firm’s Chinese-language  website .  UnionPay had $660 billion of credit-card transactions last
year, while debit-card volume was $2.1 trillion, according to
Nilson.  Chinese banks had 3.08 billion debit cards circulating at
the end of September, a 21 percent increase from a year earlier,
according to  the People’s Bank of China . The number of credit
cards printed jumped 19 percent to 318 million, according to the
central bank, which said 88.2 trillion yuan of transactions were
made through bank cards in the third quarter.  Card Circulation  China’s consumer lending  has grown at an average 29 percent
annually from 2005 to 2010 and it’s expected to increase at 24
percent a year through 2015, according to an August 2011 Boston
Consulting Group report. Receivables from credit cards, which
were broadly introduced to retail customers only in the early
2000s, could rise 40 percent annually to reach 2.5 trillion yuan
in 2015, according to the report.  China will overtake the U.S. as the largest market for
credit cards by 2020, with about 900 million cards in
circulation, MasterCard said in 2010. Credit cards featuring
UnionPay numbered 285 million and debit cards totaled 2.7
billion as of 2011, according to the Nilson Report.  Chinese tourists are fueling UnionPay’s growth overseas. On
Paris’s Boulevard Haussmann, the cards are welcomed by retailers
from  Galeries Lafayette  to Printemps.  France expects as many as 5 million Chinese tourists within
five years, or about 700,000 annually, according to a report by
its tourist development agency and consulting firm  Roland
Berger . Chinese tourists typically spend about 3,100 euros
($4,000) per household on shopping in Europe, the report shows.  Tour Buses  Across the English Channel, on an afternoon in July, two
tour buses bearing Chinese signs were parked in London’s
Knightsbridge district outside Harrods, which opened in 1849 and
has counted Sigmund Freud and  Oscar Wilde  among its customers.  Harrods has seen a sharp increase in sales and larger
purchases from Chinese customers following the acceptance of
 UnionPay  in February 2011, Katharine Witty, group director of
corporate affairs, said in an e-mail. She declined to give
specifics, citing company policy.  “China is certainly among Harrods’s most significant
customer base,” Witty said of the store, which employs more
than 80 Mandarin-speaking staff. “A large majority of Chinese
customers are now taking advantage of the UnionPay option.”  UnionPay introduced a summer promotion at merchants
including Harrods, offering a Montblanc key ring to each
customer who spent 500 pounds or more using a UnionPay card.  “I don’t have a card issued by foreign banks,” said Li,
who was visiting London with her family from Ningbo, a port city
in China’s Zhejiang province, with a UnionPay card issued by
 China Construction Bank . “It’s too much of a hassle to get
one.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
