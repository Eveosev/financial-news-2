Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-
largest Swiss lender, plans to eliminate 120 jobs in  New York
City  as Chief Executive Officer  Brady Dougan  pursues plans to
reduce expenses.  The cuts will take place between Dec. 30 and March 4 at the
company’s Madison Avenue offices in  Manhattan , the Zurich-based
bank said in a notice dated yesterday with the state Department
of Labor. The dismissals are part of previously announced cost
reductions, according to Jack Grone, a spokesman for the bank.
He declined to elaborate on the filing.  Dougan is among Wall Street chiefs who are trimming staff
to pare costs amid an industrywide slump, leading to the loss of
more than 300,000 jobs in the past two years. Credit Suisse last
month shook up its investment-banking unit to speed the process,
merging asset management with the private bank. The firm decided
last year to scale back the unit and said it would eliminate
3,500 positions.  Credit Suisse said in October that it will trim an
additional 1 billion francs ($1.1 billion) in annual costs by
the end of 2015, adding to a 1 billion-franc savings program
from July and a 2 billion-franc expense reduction achieved since
last year.  The lender disclosed to the state in May that it was
cutting 126 jobs at the same office complex. The  New York  State
Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, known as the
WARN Act, requires private employers with at least 50 personnel
in the state to provide 90 days’ notice of a plant closing, mass
firing, relocation or reduction in work hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
