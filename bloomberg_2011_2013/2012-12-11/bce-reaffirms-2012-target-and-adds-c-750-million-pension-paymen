BCE Inc. (BCE) , Canadaâ€™s largest telephone
company, reiterated its full-year sales and profit forecast and
said it will add C$750 million ($760 million) to its employee
 pension plan .  BCE expects 2012 revenue growth to be at the lower end of
the range of 3 percent to 5 percent it gave as a target Aug. 8.
Earnings excluding severance, acquisition and other costs should
be C$3.15 to C$3.20, the Montreal-based company said in a
statement. The pension contribution will come from its year-end
cash balance.  BCE has been using excess cash to refinance bonds, pay down
debt and shore up its pension plan amid stiffening competition
both from its traditional rivals and new wireless operators in
central Canada. BCE competes with  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  and
 Telus Corp. (T)  in providing mobile-phone service, cable TV and
Internet packages to Canadian consumers.  BCE was little changed in late trading after climbing 0.3
percent today to C$42.95 in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
