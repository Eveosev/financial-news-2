Colombian bonds tumbled, pushing
benchmark yields up the most in more than a year, after
lawmakers scaled back the government’s tax-reduction proposal
for foreigners investing in the local  debt market .  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in July 2024 surged 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 6.02 percent at the close in Bogota,
according to the central bank. The bond’s price fell 1.67
centavos to 132.568 centavos per peso. The increase in the yield
was the biggest since October 2011.  Lawmakers proposed a 25 percent  tax rate  on foreigners’
bond profits, rewriting a bill from President  Juan Manuel Santos 
that sought to cut the rate to 14 percent to lure more
investment and reduce the government’s borrowing costs. Bonds
plunged as traders pared back expectations for a pickup in
demand from foreigners, who currently pay a 33 percent tax rate.  “This was unexpected and is causing a big move in markets
today,” said Jorge Ruiz, a trader at Corp. Financiera
Colombiana SA in Bogota. “They are still cutting the tax but 14
percent was obviously much more attractive.”  The tax rate in the rewritten bill is in line with a
proposed 25 percent rate for corporate profits for Colombian
companies. The legislation must be approved by Congress this
month to go into effect in 2013.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told reporters today
that the change looks to maintain fairness between local and
foreign investors. The impact the rate reduction may have on the
 exchange rate  wasn’t part of the decision, he said.  Colombia  is looking to reduce yields in the $83 billion
local debt market by attracting more foreign investors with the
proposed  tax cut , Public Credit Director Maria Fernanda Suarez
said in an interview last month.  Weaker Peso  The peso declined almost 0.1 percent to 1,800.22 per  U.S.
dollar  today, paring its rally in 2012 to 7.7 percent.  The central bank’s surprise interest-rate cut on Nov. 23
and an unexpected decline in consumer prices last month drove
yields on the benchmark bond due July 2024 to a record low last
week. The yield has jumped 19 basis points from 5.83 percent on
Dec. 6, which was the lowest level on a closing basis since the
securities were first issued in 2009.  Banco de la Republica lowered the target  lending rate  by a
quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent on Nov. 23, surprising
all except two of 33 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Consumer prices fell 0.14 percent in November, the national
statistics agency reported Dec. 5. The median forecast of 29
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.15 percent
increase. Annual inflation slowed to 2.8 percent, within the
central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
