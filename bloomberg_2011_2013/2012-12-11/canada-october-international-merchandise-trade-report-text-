The following is the text of
 Canada ’s international merchandise trade report for October
from Statistics Canada.  Canada’s merchandise imports declined 1.2% while exports
increased 1.0% in October. As a result, Canada’s trade deficit
with the world narrowed from $1.0 billion in September to $169
million in October.  Imports declined to $38.3 billion, a 5.7% drop since
reaching a record high in June 2012. Volumes were down 1.8% in
October, as widespread decreases were recorded.  Exports increased to $38.1 billion in October, as both
prices and volumes were up. Exports of farm, fishing and
intermediate food products led the gains in exports while metal
ores and non-metallic minerals recorded the largest decline.  Imports from the United States rose 1.6% to $24.6 billion
and exports edged down 0.2% to $27.4 billion. Consequently,
Canada’s trade surplus with the United States decreased from
$3.2 billion in September to $2.8 billion in October.  Imports from countries other than the United States fell
5.8% to $13.7 billion. Exports rose 4.2% to $10.7 billion,
mainly on higher exports of farm, fishing and intermediate food
products. Consequently, Canada’s trade deficit with countries
other than the United States declined from $4.2 billion in
September to $2.9 billion in October.  Widespread decreases in import volumes  Imports of basic and industrial chemical, plastic and
rubber products fell 8.4% to $3.0 billion in October. A 39.4%
decline in import volumes of lubricants and other petroleum
refinery products largely contributed to the overall decrease.  Imports of metal and non-metallic mineral products declined
5.7% to $3.4 billion in October. Unwrought precious metals and
precious metal alloys, down 11.0%, was the main factor behind
the decrease as volumes fell 14.2%.  Imports of electronic and electrical equipment and parts
declined 3.1% to $4.3 billion in October, a fourth consecutive
monthly decrease. Widespread decreases were registered
throughout the section with communications and audio and video
equipment (-8.5%) posting the largest decline.  Imports of consumer goods increased 1.6% to $7.7 billion in
October, as volumes rose. Imports of pharmaceutical and
medicinal products, up 10.8% to $1.2 billion, led the overall
increase.  Farm, fishing and intermediate food products lead the gains in
exports  In October, exports of farm, fishing and intermediate food
products reached a record high of $2.8 billion, up 18.3%. This
was the fourth consecutive monthly increase. In October, strong
gains were recorded in exports of other crop products, mainly
soybeans, as well as canola. Farm, fishing and intermediate food
products volumes rose 15.8%.  Exports of energy products increased 3.0% to $8.4 billion
in October, as prices rose 4.0%. This was the third consecutive
monthly increase. Exports of crude oil and crude bitumen led the
gain, up 5.0% to $6.0 billion, as both prices and volumes
increased.  Exports of metal and non-metallic mineral products grew
5.1% to $4.6 billion, as volumes increased 10.9%. Leading the
overall gain were higher exports of unwrought nickel and nickel
alloys, up 47.6%. Recording its first gain in eight months,
unwrought, basic and semi-finished aluminum and aluminum alloy
products also contributed to the increase.  Exports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals fell 21.9%
to $1.3 billion in October. Exports of iron ores and
concentrates (-51.7%) and copper ores and concentrates (-37.7%)
were the main contributors to the decrease. The overall decline
was entirely the result of lower volumes.  Exports of aircraft and other transportation equipment and
parts also declined, down 10.8% to $1.5 billion, on lower
volumes. Exports of aircraft fell 26.3% in October.  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States,  Japan  and the United Kingdom. Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula (2007=100).  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010 -
X201000311141&amp;lang=eng) .  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data are revised with the
release of the January, February and March reference months.
Revisions to BOP based data for the previous three years are
released annually in June with the April reference month.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
sector with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables,
free of charge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
