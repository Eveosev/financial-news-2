E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR)  hit a record
low as the Budapest Stock Exchange dropped the Hungarian energy
supplier from the benchmark BUX  index  after the company filed
for bankruptcy.  The shares  tumbled  15 percent to 296 forint by the end of
trading in Budapest. The stock dived 93 percent this year as the
company failed to redeem bonds that matured in October and
struggled to buy back the securities as well as bonds due 2014
and later.  The bourse  said  it excluded E-Star from the BUX basket from
today after the company filed for bankruptcy, citing its
inability to meet payment obligations and opening the right of
its creditors to initiate liquidation proceedings. The company
plans to reach an agreement with its creditors under the
bankruptcy procedure to ensure future operation, E-Star said in
a statement last week.  “The main question is what deal will be reached during the
bankruptcy procedure,”  Akos Kuti , a Budapest-based analyst at
broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
