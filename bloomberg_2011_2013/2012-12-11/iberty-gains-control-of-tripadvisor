Liberty Interactive Corp. (LINTA)  bought
about $300 million in shares of  TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) , gaining voting
control of the online travel-review company from billionaire
Barry Diller, who stepped down as its chairman.  Liberty purchased about 4.8 million shares at $62.50 apiece
from Diller and the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation,
Liberty said today in a statement. The Englewood, Colorado-based
company now has 57 percent voting control and 22 percent of
total equity. The price represents a 63 percent premium over
yesterday’s closing price of $38.39.  Diller, who acquired TripAdvisor in 2004, spun it off from
 Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  last year into its own company. With today’s sale,
he is giving himself more time for other things while staying on
as a board member, Diller said in the statement. The move passes
control to another billionaire entrepreneur, John Malone, who
controls Liberty Interactive.  “Ever since we acquired TripAdvisor in 2004, it’s been one
of the smoothest and most trouble-free growth stories I’ve ever
known,” Diller said.  Shares of Newton, Massachusetts-based TripAdvisor jumped
6.6 percent to $40.91 at the close in New York, reaching the
highest price since July. Liberty Ventures, the tracking stock
within Liberty Interactive to which TripAdvisor common stock is
attributed, rose less than 1 percent to $59.07.  Expedia Next?  Diller owns more than 4.6 million shares and voting control
of Expedia. Today’s transaction is a potential precursor for
another deal where Malone would buy out Diller’s stake in
Expedia,  Chris Marangi , a portfolio manager at  Gamco Investors
Inc. (GBL)  in Rye, New York, said in an interview. Expedia climbed 4
percent to $60.  “There’s probably another shoe to drop here,” Marangi
said. Malone will also be able to build a larger stake in
TripAdvisor now that he has control, Marangi said.  Courtnee Ulrich, a spokeswoman for Liberty, didn’t
immediately return a phone message seeking comment on whether
the company would pursue an Expedia transaction or buy more
TripAdvisor shares. Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for Diller’s
 IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI) , declined to comment, and an e-mail to
Expedia’s press office wasn’t immediately returned.  Between 2003 and 2005, Diller spent about $8 billion
acquiring Expedia, Hotels.com, the deep-discount travel site
Hotwire and TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor is now valued at about $5.9
billion, while Expedia is worth about $8.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
