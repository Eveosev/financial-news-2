Another big financial institution.
Another fine. And nobody gets pinched.  It’s  more of the same  at the Justice Department today. HSBC
Holdings, the big British bank, admitted to committing crimes,
agreed to pay $1.9 billion, and will avoid prosecution for
money-laundering as long as it keeps its nose clean for five
years under a deferred-prosecution deal.  The crimes included laundering money for Mexican drug
cartels and sanctioned nations such as Iran and Sudan. HSBC gets
to keep its banking licenses. And, you guessed it, none of the
people who supposedly broke the law has been arrested. If recent
history is any guide, none ever will be.  That’s the real crime. Too big to fail has turned equal
justice under the law into a mockery.  ( Jonathan Weil  is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  him on
