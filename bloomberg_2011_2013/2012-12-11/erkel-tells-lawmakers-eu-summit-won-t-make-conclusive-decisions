German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  told
lawmakers of her Christian Democratic-led bloc that this week’s
European Union summit won’t arrive at conclusive decisions and
cited a lack of readiness by member states to integrate.  The German leader said the summit will be a stepping stone
in a longer process toward tighter fiscal cooperation among the
17 member states in the euro to overcome the debt crisis,
according to a party official who was present and declined to be
identified because the meeting was behind closed doors.  Merkel said many member states aren’t ready to allow
greater central fiscal controls, the official said. She also
reassured lawmakers in her faction who expressed concern about a
draft proposal by EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  on overhauling
euro-area governance, which includes a possible euro budget to
help buffer countries against shocks.  The draft is only preliminary, she said.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  expressed hope
that EU finance chiefs can reach agreement this week on a
centralized bank supervisor, though he told lawmakers
negotiations could carry on until next week, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
