Philadelphia Energy Solutions plans
to close the Girard Point section of its Philadelphia  refinery 
by the end of the month for 60 days, according to a person
familiar with the work.  Girard Point is being shut for maintenance on process
units, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the information isn’t public. The plant includes the No. 137
crude unit, which can process 200,000 barrels a day of crude.  The status of the refinery can affect spot and futures
prices of products because the plant is the largest on the East
Coast. It moves gasoline and distillate into  New York  Harbor,
the delivery point for contracts traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  Cherice Corley, a Philadelphia-based spokeswoman for the
refinery, declined in an e-mail to comment on operations.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the plant’s operator, is a
joint venture of  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  and Sunoco Inc. The refinery
can process 355,000 barrels a day of oil, according to the
companies. It has two sections, which are known as the Girard
Point and Point Breeze plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
