Sunderland defeated Reading 3-0 to
move out of the relegation places at the bottom of the standings
in English soccerâ€™s Premier League.  James McClean,  Steven Fletcher  and Stepane Sessegnon scored
as Sunderland won for just the third time in its last 24 league
matches. The win moves the Black Cats up to 15th in the 20-team
league with 16 points, one point above the three-team relegation
zone.  McClean opened the scoring in the third minute and Fletcher
doubled the Sunderland lead later in the first half. Sessegnon
then clinched the victory in second-half injury time.  Reading lost its fourth straight game and remains next to
last in the league with nine points after 16 matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
