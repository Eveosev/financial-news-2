Banco Popular  Espanol SA, Spain’s
sixth-biggest lender, is focused on opening a branch in  Turkey ,
said Juan Echanojauregui, head of international banking.  Establishing the first branch in the country is “top of
the list” of Banco Popular’s priorities, Echanojauregui said at
news conference in Istanbul today.  Banco Popular, based in Madrid, is joining  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain’s second-biggest bank, in growing
its business in Turkey, where the industry regulator expects
loans to expand between 15 percent and 18 percent this year. The
number of foreign and local banks operating in the country is
expected to reach 60, the regulator said last month. There are
currently 49 banks doing business there.  Banco Popular signed an agreement today with Turkey’s
Investment Agency to enter the market and on potential
investments, Echanojauregui said. The bank opened a liaison
office in Istanbul in May to support Spanish companies.  Banco Bilbao paid $5.8 billion for a 24.9 percent stake in
 Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , Turkey’s largest bank by market
value, last year.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , Italy’s biggest consumer
bank, applied to the regulator to open a branch last month.
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, has
also made a formal application.  To contact the reporter on this story:
