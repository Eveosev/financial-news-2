Former National Football League
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue probably will rule today on players’
appeals in the New Orleans Saints bounty case,  the Times-
Picayune reported , citing people it didn’t identify.  Details of any punishments won’t be released for another
week, the Associated Press said, to allow a federal judge in New
Orleans to decide whether to remove Tagliabue, the NFL
commissioner from 1989-2006, as the arbitrator, AP said.  The NFL said about two dozen Saints players, led by former
defensive coordinator  Gregg Williams , paid each other as much as
$1,500 from 2009 to 2011 for trying to injure players such as
Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks Kurt Warner and Brett Favre.  The players sanctioned by the NFL -- Jonathan Vilma,
Anthony Hargrove,  Will Smith  and  Scott Fujita  -- have said
they’ll be dissatisfied unless their suspensions are overturned.  Commissioner  Roger Goodell  chose Tagliabue to hear the
appeals after his original penalties were thrown out by an
arbitrator. The players then appealed his new penalties: Goodell
left Vilma’s full-season suspension unchanged, reduced
Hargrove’s by one game to seven, cut Smith’s in half to four
games and reduced Fujita’s by three games to one.  Coach  Sean Payton  was barred for a year and Williams was
suspended indefinitely. Mickey Loomis, the Saints’ general
manager, received an eight-game suspension. Those penalties were
allowed to stand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
