U.S. nuclear power generation  fell
for the third time in four days as reactors in  Nebraska  and
 North Carolina  lowered output.  Production slid 0.3 percent to 89,842 megawatts, or 88
percent of capacity, 2.4 percent lower than a  year earlier ,
according to Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by
Bloomberg. Eleven of 104 U.S. reactors were offline.  Nebraska Public Power District’s Cooper 1, a 830-megawatt
reactor 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of Omaha, was lowered to
71 percent of capacity from 100 percent yesterday.  Output at Brunswick 2,  Progress Energy ’s 937-megawatt
reactor 130 miles south of Raleigh, North Carolina, decreased by
122 megawatts to 62 percent of capacity from 75 percent.  Midwestern generation rose by 59 megawatts as production at
 NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) ’s Duane Arnold 1 reactor increased to 531
megawatts, or 83 percent of production.  Output in the Northeast was steady, with all 26 reactors
operating at 100 percent of capacity.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
