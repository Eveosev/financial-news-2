The Energy Department increased its
estimate of what U.S. households heating primarily with oil will
spend this winter.  Households will pay an average of about $2,544 for heating
oil between Oct. 1 and March 31. That’s 22 percent higher than
last winter as a result of a 3.1 percent increase in prices and
an 18 percent jump in consumption. The department projected in
the November  forecast  that spending would rise 21 percent to an
average of about $2,526, as prices gain 3.3 percent and
consumption increases 17 percent.  About 6 percent of U.S. households depend on heating oil
for space heating. The Northeast accounts for about 80 percent
of these households.lowered its estimate for gasoline demand in
2012 and decreased its forecast for prices at the pump.  Gasoline  consumption  will average 8.73 million barrels a

Energy Information Administration said today in its monthly
 Short-Term Energy Outlook . Last month’s projection was 8.73
million barrels.  The department estimated 2013 consumption at 8.74 million
barrels a day, up from the November forecast of 8.73 million.  Regular-grade gasoline will average $3.63 a gallon this
year, lower than $3.64 estimated in last month’s forecast.
Prices may average $3.43 in 2013, lower than the previous
estimate of $3.44.  Distillate demand, including heating oil and diesel, will
fall to 3.77 million barrels a day this year, down from the
November forecast of 3.78 million barrels daily. Consumption
next year is estimated to be 3.82 million barrels daily, lower
than last month’s outlook of 3.84 million barrels.  Total U.S. fuel demand may fall to 18.64 million barrels a
