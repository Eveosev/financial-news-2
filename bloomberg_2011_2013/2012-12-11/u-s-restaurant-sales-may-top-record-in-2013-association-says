U.S. restaurants may post record
sales in 2013, and job growth in the industry may outpace the
broader economy, the National Restaurant Association said.  Restaurant sales may increase for a fourth straight year,
reaching $660 billion in 2013, 3.8 percent higher than in 2012,
the Washington-based trade group said today in an e-mailed
report. Employment in the industry may rise at a 2.4 percent
rate next year, outpacing the association’s projected 1.5
percent gain in national employment, according to the report.
Restaurants may employ 13.1 million people in the U.S. next
year, representing 10 percent of the country’s workforce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
