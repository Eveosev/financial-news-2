Italy’s fourth recession since 2001
will last longer than previously forecast and the economy will
shrink 1.1 percent next year, Confindustria, the country’s
employers lobby said in a report today.  Confindustria in September had forecast the economy would
contract 0.6 percent in 2013. The group also raised its outlook
for this year, saying the economy would shrink 2.1 percent
rather than the 2.4 percent predicted in September.  “Italy is still immersed in a deep contraction of internal
demand and production, in which it fell without having even
remotely recovered from the damages of the preceding ones. The
horizon is further clouded by the uncertainty of the outcome of
the upcoming election deadline,” the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
