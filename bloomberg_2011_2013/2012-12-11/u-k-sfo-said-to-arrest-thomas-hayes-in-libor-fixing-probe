(Corrects year of dismissal in second paragraph.)  Thomas Hayes, a former trader at  UBS
AG (UBSN)  and Citigroup Inc., was arrested by the  Serious Fraud Office 
and City of London Police in its investigation into the
manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, according to
two people familiar with the matter.  Hayes, who was dismissed from Citigroup in 2010 for
suspected involvement in rate manipulation, was one of three men
arrested today in the U.K., said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the investigation is ongoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
