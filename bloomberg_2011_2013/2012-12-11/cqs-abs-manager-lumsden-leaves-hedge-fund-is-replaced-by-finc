CQS U.K. LLP said Alistair Lumsden,
who managed a hedge fund focused on asset-backed securities, has
left the $11.9 billion firm.  Lumsden, chief investment officer of the $2.3 billion CQS
ABS Fund, was replaced by Simon Finch, the London-based firm
said in a note to clients today. Finch is chief investment
officer of credit at CQS.  The ABS fund has produced average annual gains of 28
percent since inception in 2006, and has risen 14 percent
through October of this year, according to a separate note to
clients. Hedge funds focused on asset-backed securities,
including bonds linked to mortgages, outperformed rivals in 2012
as the U.S. housing market rebounded and the  Federal Reserve 
expanded its purchases of debt.  CQS spokesman Michael Rummel declined to comment.  Finch has worked in asset management for more than 18
years. Before joining CQS, he ran the asset-backed security
business at Abbey National Plc, according to the client letter.  The CQS ABS fund has an 11-person team run out of  New York 
and  London , according to the letter.  Michael Hintze  founded CQS in 1999. Hintze previously
traded convertible bonds at Credit Suisse Group AG.  To contact the reporters on this story:
