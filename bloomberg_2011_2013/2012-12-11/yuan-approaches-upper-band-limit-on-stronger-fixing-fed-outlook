China ’s  yuan  retreated from the
upper limit of its trading band, reaching a one-week low, on
speculation the central bank intervened to combat appreciation
that hurts exporters.  The yuan rose as much as 0.28 percent today to 6.2277 per
dollar in Shanghai, exceeding today’s reference rate of 6.2906
by the maximum 1 percent allowed by the People’s Bank of China.
The currency subsequently fell to 6.2558, 0.17 percent weaker
than yesterday’s closing level and the lowest it has been since
Dec. 4, before closing little changed at 6.2460, according to
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  Overseas sales  climbed 2.9 percent from a year earlier in
November, the least in three months, the customs bureau reported
yesterday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
economists was for a 9 percent increase. New yuan  loans  amounted
to 522.9 billion yuan ($83.9 billion) in November and 505.2
billion yuan in October, the lowest monthly totals since
September 2011, according to data released today.  “The market is speculating the central bank probably came
out to buy dollars,” said  Liu Dongliang , a senior analyst in
Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest
lender. “After all, the outlook for overseas demand is still
unclear.”  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, dropped
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.55 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Today’s closing level
for the currency was 0.7 percent stronger than the reference
rate, the smallest gap since Oct. 15.  ‘Still Bullish’  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan declined 0.2
percent to 6.2245 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.11
percent to 6.3223. That is 1.2 percent weaker than the  Shanghai 
spot rate, which reached a 19-year high of 6.2223 on Nov. 27.  “The market is still bullish given the test on the upper
band and the improving data, but the PBOC wants to rein in the
optimism,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a regional currency
strategist at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Also,
any addition to Federal Reserve easing moves will be a negative
for the dollar,” supporting Asian currencies, he said.  Federal Reserve policy makers begin a two-day meeting today
that will be followed by updated projections on economic growth,
unemployment, inflation and interest rates on Dec. 12. Fed
officials are considering whether to supplement $40 billion a
month of mortgage-bond purchases with Treasury purchases when
their Operation Twist program expires at the end of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
