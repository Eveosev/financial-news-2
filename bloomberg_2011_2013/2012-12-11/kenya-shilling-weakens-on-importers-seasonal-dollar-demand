Kenya ’s shilling weakened, touching
the lowest in more than six months, as importers bought dollars
before the holiday season.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
less than 0.1 percent to close 85.95 a dollar, having weakened
by as much as 0.4 percent earlier, in Nairobi, the capital.  Imports in Kenya rise during the Christmas and year-end
period as companies anticipate higher sales. Christians account
for 87 percent of Kenya’s 38 million population, according to
the CIA World Factbook. Remittances fell to $92.1 million in
October from $92.5 million in September, the Central Bank of
Kenya said yesterday. It rose 12.7 percent over the same period
of last year.  “The shilling is on weaker footing as the oil importers
and manufacturing sector front load their dollar demand ahead of
the holidays,” Chris Muiga, a senior currency dealer at
Nairobi-based  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said by phone. “The
expectation is a weaker shilling at the beginning of the year to
the range of 86.50 to 86.70 which has prompted a surge in demand
for the dollar.”  Kenya’s current-account deficit widened by 35.3 percent to
$4.3 billion in the year to September 2012 from $3.2 billion a
year ago, as imports jumped 10.1 percent and exports climbed 2.9
percent, the bank said on its website on Dec. 6.  The Ugandan shilling gained 0.3 percent to 2,683 a dollar,
appreciating for a second day. Tanzania’s shilling traded
unchanged at 1,600 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
