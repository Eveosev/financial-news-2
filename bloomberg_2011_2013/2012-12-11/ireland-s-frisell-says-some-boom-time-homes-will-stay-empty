Irish Central Bank Chief Economist
 Lars Frisell  said some of the homes built during the nation’s
real estate bubble will never be lived in.  “A certain number of the housing units that were produced
at the peak of the bubble -- three or four times the annual
demand -- will never be lived in,” he said in a speech in
Galway, in western Ireland today. “An even larger
number will significantly deteriorate before they find a buyer.
This is the real cost to society, a huge waste of productive
resources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
