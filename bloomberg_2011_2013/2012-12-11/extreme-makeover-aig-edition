Treasury Secretary  Tim Geithner  may want to consider hosting "Extreme Makeover" as his next gig. After all, the  American International Group Inc (AIG)  (AIG). rescue he helped engineer has come to a shiny, sparkling  end  with a reconstructed company that's so attractive an investment it's generating a profit for the U.S. government. It's a Hollywood ending for a controversial rescue that many thought would never end -- or certainly not end well. But what is the moral of this seemingly feel-good tale? Will AIG's experience perpetuate moral hazard and make  Washington  less afraid to ride to a financial firm's rescue? Or will the Dodd-Frank law that AIG's rescue spawned prevent a sequel? This week, the Treasury Department  said  it will sell its remaining stake in AIG, bringing an end to the government's investment. The sale of 234 million shares at a price of $32.50 per share will help generate an overall $22.7 billion profit for the federal government. That amount stems from the holdings of both the  U.S. Treasury  and the  Federal Reserve  Bank of New York, which together extended AIG a $182 billion lifeline beginning in 2008. But Washington's rescue conveyed an even bigger benefit than just generating a profit: It returned the giant insurer to its roots as a primarily sleepy insurance company, helping to suck risk out of the financial system. AIG, with the assistance of a government-orchestrated restructuring led by former Treasury official  Jim Millstein , was able to shed its riskier assets and find solid financial footing. AIG Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche , the former CEO of MetLife Inc., has sold many of the company's units, including its consumer-finance and Asian life-insurance operations, to help repay the government and simplify AIG, as Bloomberg News  reports . This week, Benmosche agreed to sell an 80 percent stake in the insurer’s plane-leasing unit. As of Sept. 30, AIG had about $550 billion in assets, compared with more than $1 trillion at the end of 2007. As Benmosche  said  in a letter to employees, Treasury's final share sale "marks our second act." The company will  likely  be regulated by the Federal Reserve as a "systemically important financial institution" and be required to hold higher levels of capital to counter any risk-taking. Treasury, meanwhile, is expected to make $5 billion on its investment, and the Fed will earn a $17.7 billion profit. That's a fairly unexpected ending to a rescue that at times seemed bottomless and threatened to topple Geithner. The Treasury secretary, who headed the  New York  Fed when AIG was rescued, was blasted for not stopping  bonus payments  to AIG workers and for a  decision  allowing AIG to make counterparties, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., whole. Those criticisms will persist, but the makeover Geithner helped orchestrate turned AIG into a much prettier version of itself -- a version it probably could not have achieved absent the government's help.
