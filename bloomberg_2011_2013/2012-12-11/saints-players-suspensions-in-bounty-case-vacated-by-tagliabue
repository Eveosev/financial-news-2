All player suspensions in the New
Orleans Saints bounty case were thrown out by former National
Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who placed the
blame for the program on the team’s coaches and front office.  Hearing the players’ case on appeal, Tagliabue agreed with
current Commissioner  Roger Goodell ’s findings that Jonathan Vilma, Anthony Hargrove and  Will Smith  engaged in detrimental
conduct. He said a fourth player,  Scott Fujita , didn’t take part
in the bounty plan.  “My affirmation of Commissioner Goodell’s findings could
certainly justify the issuance of fines,” Tagliabue said in a
statement released yesterday by NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  on his
Twitter page. “However, this entire case has been contaminated
by the coaches and others in the Saints’ organization.”  The league said in a statement, also released on Aiello’s
Twitter page, that it respected Tagliabue’s ruling.  “The decisions have made clear that the Saints operated a
bounty program in violation of league rules for three years,
that the program endangered player safety, and that the
commissioner has the authority under the CBA to impose
discipline for those actions as conduct detrimental to the
league,” the NFL said in the statement. “Strong action was
taken in this matter to protect player safety and ensure that
bounties would be eliminated from football.”  Players Only  The NFL Players Association called the decision a “fair
outcome.”  “Vacating all discipline affirms the players’unwavering
position that all allegations the league made about their
alleged intent-to-injure were utterly and completely false,”
the union said in an e-mailed statement.  Gabe Feldman, director of the Sports Law Program at  Tulane
University  in New Orleans, called the ruling a “tremendous
victory” for the players, and said that it also affirmed
Goodell’s position to rule on similar future cases. He said the
ruling put the onus on the Saints’ organization.  “The report argues that this bounty scheme was put in
place by the coaches and the investigation of the bounty scheme
was obstructed by the coaches,” Feldman said in a telephone
interview. “The players were, in essence, following the orders
of their coaches.”  Coaches Banned  Tagliabue’s ruling applied only to players, and the full-
season ban of Saints coach  Sean Payton  and indefinite suspension
of former defensive coordinator  Gregg Williams  remain in effect.  Vilma will go ahead with a defamation suit filed against
Goodell, his lawyer said.  The Saints, who won the  Super Bowl  after the 2009 season,
are 5-8 this season after losing their first four games.  “Congratulations to our players for having the suspensions
vacated,” Saints quarterback  Drew Brees  said on Twitter.
“Unfortunately, there are some things that can never be taken
back.”  The Tagliabue ruling came two days after Hargrove’s agent
said the players rejected a settlement proposal from the league.  The NFL said in March that about two dozen Saints players,
led by Williams, paid each other as much as $1,500 from 2009 to
2011 for trying to injure players such as Super Bowl-winning
quarterbacks  Kurt Warner  and  Brett Favre .  Performance Pool  Current and former Saints players and coaches have said
that a performance pool existed to reward defensive plays such
as hard tackles. They have denied that money was used as an
incentive to intentionally injure opponents.  Goodell chose Tagliabue, 72, in October to hear the appeals
after his original penalties were thrown out by an arbitrator
who ruled the commissioner had overstepped his bounds.  The players then appealed the new penalties, and Goodell
retained Vilma’s full-season suspension, reduced Hargrove’s by
one game to seven, cut Smith’s in half to four games and reduced
Fujita’s by three games to one.  Tagliabue dismissed all four bans. Fujita acknowledged
taking part in a performance pool that didn’t pay for injuries,
and Tagliabue said such participation is “typically subject
only to club discipline.”  In October, Vilma’s lawyers filed papers with U.S. District
Court Judge Helen C. Berrigan in  New Orleans  saying that
Tagliabue has a conflict of interest in the case because he is
associated with Covington & Burling LLP, the Washington-based
 law firm  that is defending Goodell in the defamation suit.
Tagliabue was NFL commissioner from 1989-2006.  Salary Figures  None of the players missed any time, or salary, because of
the suspensions, as they were allowed to keep playing while
appealing the discipline. Fujita, 33, now on injured reserve
with the  Cleveland Browns , was due to be paid $3.65 million this
season, while Vilma, 30, is owed $1.6 million, according to the
union website. Smith, 31, is earning $825,000; Hargrove, 29, is
a free agent. The Saints host the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  (6-7) on
Dec. 16.  The league tried last week to settle the case prior to
Tagliabue’s ruling, but its offer of reduced or eliminated
suspensions was rejected by the players, Hargrove’s agent, Phil
Williams, told CBS on Dec. 9 during its NFL pregame show. Under
that proposal, players would have been fined and forced to admit
guilt, AP said, citing an unidentified person familiar with the
matter.  In addition to the four players, Williams and Payton,
General Manager Mickey Loomis was banned for a half-season.
Assistant coach  Joe Vitt  served a six-game ban and is now
interim head coach in Payton’s absence.  The Saints lost their first four games of the season, and
have now lost their last three. The team probably won’t make the
playoffs for the first time since 2008.  The defamation case is Vilma v. Goodell, 12-cv-1283, U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of  Louisiana  (New
Orleans).  To contact the reporter on this story:
