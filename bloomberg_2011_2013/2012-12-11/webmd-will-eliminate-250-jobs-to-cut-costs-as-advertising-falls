WebMD Health Corp. (WBMD) , the online
provider of medical information, will eliminate 250 jobs in a
cost-cutting measure designed to deal with a decline in drug-
company advertising.  The positions represent 14 percent of the company’s
workforce and are part of a broader effort expected to reduce
operating expenses by about $45 million a year, WebMD said in a
statement today. The New York-based company said it plans to
take a pretax restructuring charge of $6 million to $8 million
in this year’s fourth quarter.  WebMD generates most of its  revenue  from ads and
sponsorships, and said in July that business would probably
suffer as drugmakers face patent expirations and delayed
products. The information company’s shares had fallen 63 percent
this year through yesterday.  “Becoming leaner and more nimble will enable the company
to extend our leadership in this highly dynamic and increasingly
demanding marketplace,” Chief Executive Officer Cavan Redmond
said in today’s statement. “Anticipated changes in U.S. health-
care will provide meaningful new opportunities to link the needs
of patients, consumers and health-care professionals to enable
them to navigate their care.”  WebMD rose 12 percent to $15.45 at the close in  New York ,
valuing the company at about $773 million. The information
provider said in a January regulatory filing that it had broken
off talks with potential buyers after concluding that any offers
would be less than its market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
