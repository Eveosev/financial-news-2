Most rapeseed, sugar beet and wheat
crops in the U.K. meet environmental standards for use in
biofuels, the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board said.  Ninety-seven percent of the country’s rapeseed, all of its
sugar beets and 84 percent of its wheat may be able to “freely
enter the biofuel supply chain” after meeting European Union
 criteria  on greenhouse gas emissions, the AHDB’s Home-Grown
Cereals Authority said today on its  website . The findings, from
AHDB and an industry group consortium, were based on data that
included crop yields, fuel and fertilizer use, soil organic
matter and oil content in rapeseed.  New crop-specific targets going into effect April 1 may
restrict  market access  for some parts of the U.K., meaning
“crops from these regions could effectively be traded at a
discount,” AHDB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
