European dairy market prospects are
favorable in the medium and long term as the bloc moves to phase
out production quotas, the European Commission said.  In the majority of the European Union’s 27 member
countries, quotas are “no longer relevant to limiting
production” and prices paid by farmers seeking to exceed quotas
are already at or near zero, the commission, the bloc’s
executive arm, said in a  report  on its website.  Population
growth  and increasingly westernized diets in  emerging markets ,
which often include more protein products, may be supportive for
the industry, the EU said.  Prices will “trend towards higher levels with some ups and
downs along the curve,” the EU said. “The current difficulties
endured by dairy farmers in certain areas more severely hit by
the hike in the price of feedstuffs do not hide the overall
positive picture of the sector.”  Since 2009, EU milk production caps have been increasing by
1 percent annually, with the goal of phasing out  quotas 
altogether by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
