Italian bonds rose, with 10-year
yields falling from the highest level in three weeks, as concern
eased that Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s resignation would derail
the nation’s attempts to cut its debt load.  Italy ’s securities snapped their slide from yesterday
before the nation sells as much as 6.5 billion euros ($8.44
billion) of bills tomorrow and debt due in 2015 and 2026 the
following day. Spanish bonds advanced after an auction of bills
raised more than the maximum target set for the sale. Greece’s
yields fell to the lowest since the nation’s debt was
restructured in March as its offer to buy back sovereign debt
expired. German bunds fell after investor confidence improved.  “The initial fear was about uncertainty as the timing of
Monti’s resignation was unexpected, but we have seen some calm
come back,” said Robin Marshall, director of fixed-income at
Smith & Williamson Investment Management in  London , which
oversees the equivalent of $19 billion. The “auction should be
fine but I think the fears will come back again as we go towards
the election campaign, probably in” the first quarter, he told
 Maryam Nemazee  on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse.”  Italy’s 10-year yield dropped 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 4.72 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
climbing to 4.90 percent yesterday, the highest since Nov. 21.
The 5.5 percent bond due in November 2022 rose 0.78, or 7.80
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 106.55.  Two-year yields fell 10 basis points to 2.23 percent.  Austerity Measures  The nation’s bonds slid yesterday as former premier  Silvio Berlusconi  entered the race to become next prime minister,
reinvigorating the campaign against Monti’s austerity measures.  Monti will hand in his official resignation after
attempting to muster parliamentary support for the 2013 budget
law. The premier said in Oslo he expects to serve as a caretaker
until a new government is installed. The election may take place
on Feb. 17 or Feb. 24, Interior Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri
said yesterday.  “We are not necessarily panicking about the political
situation in Italy,” said  Silvio Peruzzo , an economist at
Nomura International in London. “The most likely outcome after
the election is that the politics remain broadly unchanged. The
market was probably looking at starting to price this risk in
January, so it’s just brought it forward.”  Spain Sale  Spanish bonds rallied as the nation sold a combined 3.89
billion euros of bills, above the upper target of 3.5 billion
euros. It auctioned 12-month securities at an average yield of
2.556 percent, versus 2.797 percent on Nov. 20, and 18-month
debt at 2.778 percent, down from 3.034 percent.  Spain ’s  10-year yield  declined 10 basis points to 5.46
percent after rising to 5.66 percent yesterday, the highest
level since Nov. 26.  Greece ’s 10-year  yield  fell 60 basis points to 13.21
percent as state-run NET TV reported that banks offered
additional bonds into the nation’s buyback to bring the
operation up to its goal of 30 billion euros.  Greece is using a 10 billion-euro loan from  Europe ’s
bailout fund to repurchase debt it issued earlier this year at
around one third of face value, seeking to unlock bailout funds
that have been frozen since June. The price of the 10-year
security rose to 43.73 cents on the euro today.  Germany ’s 10-year bonds dropped for a second day, with the
yield climbing one basis point to 1.32 percent.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations rose to 6.9
from minus 15.7 in November. Economists predicted a gain to
minus 11.5, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Volatility on Irish  government bonds  was the highest in the
euro area today, followed by those of Greece and Spain,
according to measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt,
the spread between two- and 10-year securities, and credit
default swaps.  Italian bonds returned 18 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
debt gained 4.3 percent and Germany’s rose 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
