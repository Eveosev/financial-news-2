New York Jets wide receiver  Stephen
Hill  may return soon from a knee injury he suffered two days ago
at the Jacksonville Jaguars, coach  Rex Ryan  said.  The Jets are awaiting results of a scan on Hill’s right
knee, Ryan said at a news conference yesterday. The exam showed
Hill has a sprained ligament and will not need surgery, ESPN
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Hill, 21, was injured in the second quarter of the 17-10
win against the Jaguars when he became entangled with a
defensive back.  “Hopefully he’ll be able to bounce back,” Ryan said.
“Hopefully Stephen won’t have that big of an injury.”  Hill, the Jets’ second-round pick from Georgia Tech in the
2012 National Football League draft, missed two games this
season with a hamstring injury. He has 21 receptions for 252
yards and three touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
