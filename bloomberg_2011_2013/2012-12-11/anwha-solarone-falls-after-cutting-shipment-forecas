Hanwha SolarOne Co. (HSOL) , a Chinese
solar-panel manufacturer, fell the most in more than a week
after the company reported a wider third-quarter loss and
reduced its forecast for panel shipments.  Hanwha’s American depositary receipts fell 4.2 percent to
92 cents at the close in New York, the most since Nov. 30. The
Qidong, China-based company’s ADRs are each worth five ordinary
shares.  The company reported a net loss of 322.1 million  yuan 
($51.6 million), compared with a loss of 177.6 million yuan a
year earlier, according to a statement today. Revenue fell 33
percent to 966.1 million yuan.  Hanwha is facing “challenging industry conditions,”
including a global glut that boosted its inventories and dragged
down panel  prices  21 percent industrywide in the past year,
Chief Executive Officer Hong Ki-Joon said in the statement.
Demand is slowing as U.S. and European governments reduce
support for alternative energy.  Hanwha expects to ship 825 megawatts to 850 megawatts of
panels this year, down from a previous forecast of 900 megawatts
to 1 gigawatt.  Hanwha Group, the Korean conglomerate that owns the solar
company, acquired the German solar manufacturer Q-Cells SE in
October to expand its renewable-energy operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
