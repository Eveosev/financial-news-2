GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  sold its first
bonds in pounds since 2008, joining French retailer  Carrefour SA (CA) 
and AT&T Inc. in tapping credit markets as the cost to insure
corporate debt from default fell to an 11-week low.  Companies raised about 3.7 billion euros ($4.8 billion)
from bonds today, extending the busiest start to a December for
issuance since 2008. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of
credit-default swaps on 50 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings dropped 17 basis points to 463, the lowest since
Sept. 19.  Bond risk eased as German investor confidence rose more
than economists estimated and as investors speculated progress
is being made on U.S. talks to avert tax increases and spending
cuts in January that could lead to a recession.  Germany ’s ZEW
Center for European Economic Research said its index of investor
confidence climbed to 6.9 from minus 15.7 in November.  “This is realistically the last week to get anything done
before the year-end break,” said Juan Esteban Valencia, a
strategist at Societe Generale SA in Paris. “If the U.S. budget
talks break down we’ll see risk aversion rise, but I think most
people are expecting the news to be positive sooner or later.”  Glaxo, the U.K.’s biggest drugmaker, sold 1.4 billion
pounds ($2.3 billion) of bonds in two parts that will be used to
fund maturing debt and for general corporate purposes, said
Sarah Spencer, a spokeswoman for the company in  London .  The pharmaceutical firm raised 600 million pounds from 15-
year notes yielding 108 basis points more than benchmark
government debt, and 800 million pounds from 33-year bonds at a
spread of 103 basis points, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Duration Junkies’  “I expect demand for the Glaxo deal will be well in excess
of the total raised, given the recent interest in new issues,”
said Daniel McKernan, head of European and U.K. credit at
Scottish Widows Investment Partnership in Edinburgh. “The 15-
year looks better value but the 33-year will appeal to the
duration junkies.”  The yield premium on Glaxo’s existing 700 million pounds
($1.1 billion) of senior 6.375 percent bonds due March 2039
widened 12 basis points to 107, the biggest gap since July 7,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Carrefour sold 1 billion euros of five-year bonds to fund
maturing debt and to finance general corporate purposes,
according to people familiar with the transaction.  The retailer’s 3.875 percent notes due 2021 fell 0.4
percent to 109.27 cents on the euro, pushing the yield premium
to 165 basis points, the highest since Nov. 15, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. An official at the Boulogne-
Billancourt, France-based company declined to comment.  AT&T, ThyssenKrupp  AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. telephone company, sold 1
billion euros of bonds due 2032 at a yield of 140 basis points
more than the benchmark swap rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s the Dallas-based company’s second bond sale in
euros this year.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ’s bonds led declines among junk-rated debt
after Germany’s biggest steelmaker posted a second straight
yearly loss. The company’s 4.375 percent bonds due 2017 were the
biggest fallers in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Euro Non-
Financial High-Yield Constrained Index, dropping one percent to
104.06 cents on the euro and pushing the yield to a two-month
high of 3.4 percent.  Risk Falls  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on senior debt issued by banks and insurers fell six basis
points to 152. The financial subordinated index dropped eight
basis points to 262.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings declined four basis points to 115.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
