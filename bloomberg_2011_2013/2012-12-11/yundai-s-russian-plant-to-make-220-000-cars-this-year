Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s plant in St.
Petersburg,  Russia ’s second-biggest city, is running at full
capacity and expects to produce 220,000 cars under the Hyundai
Solaris and Kia Rio brands this year, said the plant’s senior
director, Sipoyng Kim.  The company opened its plant in St. Petersburg in 2010 to
supply the growing Russian car market with Hyundai and Kia
models, investing about about $500 million. It produced about
139,000 cars in 2011, Kim said today at a press conference.  “Hyundai increased sales in 2012 by 15 percent, compared
to 2011, to 173,000 cars, thanks to the locally made Solaris
model,” said Denis Petrukhin, the head of the company’s Russia
and CIS unit. He expects Hyundai to boost sales in 2013 as much
as 5 percent, in line with forecasts for the local car market.  Car sales in Russia grew 12 percent to 2.68 million in the
first 11 months of 2012 from a year earlier, according to the
Association of European Business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
