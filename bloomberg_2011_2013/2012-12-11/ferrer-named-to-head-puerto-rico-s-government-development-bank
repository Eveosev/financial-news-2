Javier D. Ferrer has been named the
next president of the Government Development Bank for Puerto
Rico, the commonwealth’s financing arm, according to a spokesman
for Governor-elect Alejandro Garcia Padilla.       Ferrer, a corporate lawyer at Pietrantoni Mendez & Alvarez
LLC in San Juan, will help oversee the commonwealth’s debt
issuance. The Havana native graduated from Harvard University in
1983 and earned a law degree at Boston College in 1986,
according to a bio on the website of his firm.  Jesus Manuel Ortiz, the spokesman for Garcia Padilla,
confirmed the appointment in an interview. Ferrer will take over
from Juan Carlos Batlle, who will leave the post when the new
administration takes over Jan. 2.   Garcia Padilla, a member of the Popular Democratic Party,
defeated Governor Luis Fortuno in last month’s election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
