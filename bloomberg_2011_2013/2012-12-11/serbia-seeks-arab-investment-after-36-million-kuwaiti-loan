Serbia  will ask state-owned
investment funds in  Kuwait , United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia to help finance infrastructure projects.  The list of projects will be prepared for a meeting with
potential investors in Kuwait in April, the government said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development  agreed yesterday
to lend 10 million Kuwaiti dinars ($35.5 million) to Serbiaâ€™s
state  rail company  to complete a new railway station in
Belgrade. The 18-year loan, including a four-year grace period,
carries a 3 percent interest rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
