Hertz Global Holdings Inc., the
second-largest U.S. rental-car company, declined the most in
more than five weeks after three investors sold 50 million of
its shares.  The  stock  of  Park Ridge , New Jersey-based Hertz fell
1.9 percent to $15.90 at the close in New York, the largest one-
day slide since Nov. 2.  Investment funds associated with Clayton, DubilierÂ & Rice
LLC,  Carlyle Group (CG)  and  Bank of America Corp.  sold the stock to
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  as underwriter for a public offering of the
shares, Hertz said in a statement yesterday after trading
closed. The three investors will still own about 110 million
shares, or 26 percent of the total outstanding, Hertz said.  Hertz last month acquired Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group
Inc. for $2.6 billion to solidify its position as No. 2 in the
industry, ahead of  Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR)  Enterprise Holdings
Inc., which operates the Enterprise, Alamo and National brands,
is the biggest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
