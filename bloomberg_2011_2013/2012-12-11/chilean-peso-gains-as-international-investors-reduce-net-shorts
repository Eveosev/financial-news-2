Chile’s peso rose for a sixth
straight day in the longest winning streak since January as
international investors reduced their bets against the currency
to a six-month low.  The currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 475.33 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close in Santiago.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
reduced net shorts to $6.7 billion on Dec. 7, the lowest since
May. The peso is catching up with copper, which rallied 6.8
percent in the past month as  China ’s industrial production
expanded at the fastest pace in eight months in the year through
November. A short is a bet an asset will lose value.  “It’s back where it should be given the fundamentals of
the Chilean economy and what’s going on in the world,” said
Eugenio Cortes, the head of currency forwards at EuroAmerica
Corredores de Bolsa SA. “Copper has rebounded on the Chinese
data. The dollar has been falling, but it may now be a bit
oversold, and some of the offshore investors could look to take
profit.”  On Dec. 6, Chilean banks had their biggest bets against the
dollar in the  spot market  since April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
