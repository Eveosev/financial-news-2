will step up monetary policy easing when it concludes a meeting
today and as investors weighed progress in U.S. budget talks.  American Depositary Receipts of Japanese auto exporter
Toyota Motor Corp. gained 0.6 percent. Those of  Canon Inc. (7751) 
gained 2.5 percent after the Nikkei newspaper reported the
camera maker will cut costs by as much as 80 billion yen ($970
million) next year.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest
mining company, rose 1.2 percent in Sydney after agreeing to

billion a month buying of U.S. treasuries to replace its
expiring Operation Twist,” said Cameron Peacock, Melbourne-
based market strategist at IG Markets Ltd., a provider of
trading services in equities, currencies and commodities. “In
theory, there shouldn’t be a huge reaction to news that the Fed
is initiating this program given it has been speculated on for
some time and should be priced in. Look for a sizeable negative
reaction if the Fed either does a smaller size or delays the
program until the New Year.”  Fed Meeting  Fed officials are considering whether to supplement $40
billion a month of mortgage-bond buying with purchases of
Treasuries when their Operation Twist program expires at the end
of the month. A two-day meeting concluding today will be
followed by statements on the economy and monetary policy.  Dealers who trade with the Fed expect the central bank will
begin buying as much as $45 billion a month in Treasuries at its
Dec. 12 meeting and keep benchmark interest rates about zero
into 2015, Bloomberg surveys show.  U.S. lawmakers need to agree on a budget to prevent more
than $600 billion of automatic tax increases and spending cuts
from coming into effect next year.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent yesterday as German
investor confidence climbed and traders awaited progress on
 federal budget  negotiations in  Washington .  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index advanced 11 percent this year
through yesterday and is trading at its highest level since
April as central banks took steps to support economic growth.
