The following is the text of the U.S.
trade balance report for October released by the Commerce
Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, through the Department of Commerce, announced today
that total October exports of $180.5 billion and imports of
$222.8 billion resulted in a goods and services deficit of $42.2
billion, up from $40.3 billion in September, revised. October
exports were $6.8 billion less than September exports of $187.3
billion. October imports were $4.9 billion less than September
imports of $227.6 billion.  In October, the goods deficit increased $1.8 billion from
September to $59.2 billion, and the services surplus decreased
$0.1 billion from September to $16.9 billion. Exports of goods
decreased $6.5 billion to $127.5 billion, and imports of goods
decreased $4.6 billion to $186.6 billion. Exports of services
decreased $0.3 billion to $53.0 billion, and imports of services
decreased $0.2 billion to $36.1 billion.  The goods and services deficit decreased $3.5 billion from
October 2011 to October 2012.  Exports were up $1.8 billion, or
1.0 percent, and imports were down $1.7 billion, or 0.8 percent.  Goods (Census Basis)  The September to October decrease in exports of goods
reflected decreases in industrial supplies and materials ($2.9
billion); capital goods ($1.9 billion); foods, feeds, and
beverages ($1.4 billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and
engines ($0.4 billion); and consumer goods ($0.1 billion). An
increase occurred in other goods ($0.2 billion).  The September to October decrease in imports of goods
reflected decreases in consumer goods ($3.6 billion); automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($0.5 billion); foods, feeds, and
beverages ($0.4 billion); capital goods ($0.4 billion); and
other goods ($0.3 billion). An increase occurred in industrial
supplies and materials ($0.4 billion).  The October 2011 to October 2012 decrease in exports of
goods reflected a decrease in industrial supplies and materials
($3.4 billion). Increases occurred in foods, feeds, and
beverages ($1.1 billion); capital goods ($0.6 billion); consumer
goods ($0.6 billion); other goods ($0.3 billion); and automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($0.2 billion).  The October 2011 to October 2012 decrease in imports of
goods reflected decreases in consumer goods ($2.8 billion);
industrial supplies and materials ($2.1 billion); and foods,
feeds, and beverages ($0.6 billion). Increases occurred in
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($2.2 billion); capital
goods ($1.3 billion); and other goods ($0.6 billion).  Services  Exports of services decreased $0.3 billion from September
to October. The decrease was more than accounted for by
decreases in travel ($0.3 billion) and passenger fares ($0.2
billion). An increase in other private services ($0.2 billion),
which includes items such as business, professional, and
technical services, insurance services, and financial services,
was partly offsetting. Changes in the other categories of
services exports were small.  Imports of services decreased $0.2 billion from September
to October.  The decrease was more than accounted for by
decreases in travel ($0.1 billion), passenger fares ($0.1
billion), and other transportation ($0.1 billion), which
includes freight and port services. An increase in other private
services ($0.1 billion) was partly offsetting.  Changes in the
other categories of services imports were small.  The October 2011 to October 2012 increase in exports of
services was $2.2 billion. The largest increases were in other
private services ($1.5 billion) and travel ($0.7 billion).
Within other private services, the largest increase was in
business, professional, and technical services.  The October 2011 to October 2012 increase in imports of
services was $0.1 billion. The largest increases were in
royalties and license fees ($0.2 billion), travel ($0.2 billion),
and passenger fares ($0.1 billion).  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in October, exports of goods
and services averaged $183.2 billion, while imports of goods and
services averaged $224.9 billion, resulting in an average trade
deficit of $41.7 billion. For the three months ending in
September, the average trade deficit was $41.5 billion,
reflecting average exports of $184.2 billion and average imports
of $225.7 billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The October figures show surpluses, in billions of dollars,
with Hong Kong $1.9 ($2.2 for September), Australia $1.8 ($1.9),
Singapore $0.5 ($0.7), and  Egypt  $0.2 ($0.3). Deficits were
recorded, in billions of dollars, with China $29.5 ($29.1),
European Union $10.6 ($8.6), OPEC $8.6 ($7.1), Japan $7.0 ($4.8),
Germany $5.4 ($5.2), Mexico $4.4 ($4.8), Canada $1.9 ($1.9),
Ireland $1.8 ($1.6), Nigeria $1.8 ($1.2), Venezuela $1.8 ($1.1),
Korea $1.6 ($1.3), and Taiwan $1.4 ($1.3).  Advanced technology products exports were $26.1 billion in
October and imports were $36.1 billion, resulting in a deficit
of $10.1 billion. October exports were $0.3 billion more than
the $25.8 billion in September, while October imports were $3.2
billion more than the $32.9 billion in September.  Revisions  Census Basis (not seasonally adjusted)  For September, exports of goods were revised down $0.1
billion and imports of goods were revised down $0.2 billion.
Goods carry-over in October was virtually zero for exports and
$0.8 billion (0.4 percent) for imports. For September, revised
export carry-over was $0.1 billion (0.1 percent) and revised
import carry-over was $0.6 billion (0.3 percent).  Balance of Payments Basis (seasonally adjusted)  For April 2012 through September 2012, exports and imports
of goods and services were revised to incorporate more
comprehensive and updated quarterly and monthly data.  For September, exports of goods were revised down $0.1
billion and imports of goods were revised down $0.2 billion.
Exports of services were revised up $0.4 billion, mostly
reflecting upward revisions in travel and transfers under U.S.
military sales contracts that were partly offset by a downward
revision in royalties and license fees. Imports of services were
revised down $0.7 billion, mostly reflecting downward revisions
in other private services and travel.  NOTICE  Accelerated Release  Beginning with the January 2013 statistics scheduled for
release on March 7, 2013, the U.S. International Trade in Goods
and Services news release (FT-900) will be available an average
of 35 calendar days after the end of the reference month.  This
accelerates the release of the FT-900 by approximately one week.
The new schedule is located on page A-5 of this release.  Changes to Exhibit 15  Beginning with the January 2013 statistics scheduled for
release on March 7, 2013, Exhibit 15 in the FT-900 will be
modified to incorporate changes in commodity groupings and
definitions.  There will also be minor modifications to the
general structure of the exhibit.  In order to reflect a more comprehensive and cohesive
listing of commodities, Exhibit 15. Exports and Imports of Goods
by Principal Commodities will see the following changes:  The Manufactured Goods total will be based on the North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The current selected commodities will be replaced with 1-
and 2- digit Standard International Trade Classification (SITC)
codes.  An example of the modified exhibit in Excel format is
available at www.census.gov/foreign-
trade/statistics/notices/20121211_exh15.html. With the December
2012 statistics scheduled for release on February 8, 2013,
historical data from January 2010 to December 2012 will be made
available at the same location.  Updated Revision Policy for Goods on a Census Basis  Beginning with the U.S. International Trade in Goods and
Services: April 2013 and the accompanying U.S. International
Trade in Goods and Service: Annual Revision for 2012 news
releases scheduled for release on June 4, 2013, revised trade
statistics will be made available for the not seasonally
adjusted series for the prior three years. Currently, the not
seasonally adjusted data are only revised for the previous year,
while seasonal factors and deflators are revised for three years.
With this update to the revision procedure, the U.S. Census
Bureau will apply corrections and adjustments to the not
seasonally adjusted data for the prior three years (2010-2012),
consistent with the three years of revised seasonal factors and
deflators. This updated revision procedure will improve the
overall quality of the published trade statistics, with the
potential for substantial impact on specific commodity level and
other detailed Census data products. If you have any questions
