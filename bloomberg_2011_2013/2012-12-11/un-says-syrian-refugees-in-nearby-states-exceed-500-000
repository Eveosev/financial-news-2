More than 500,000 Syrians have
registered as refugees in neighboring countries, the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said today.  Almost 510,000 people have registered or are in the process
of registering in Lebanon, Jordan,  Iraq , Turkey and North
Africa, according to Melissa Fleming, UNHCR chief spokeswoman,
according to an e-mailed statement. The number is rising at a
rate of 3,000 a day, she said.  “Syrian refugees arriving during recent bad weather
reached Jordan with soaked clothing and mud-covered shoes due to
heavy rainfall,” she said. “UNHCR protection teams described
the night-time arrivals as fearful, freezing and without proper
winter clothing.”  Many more Syrians have arrived in neighboring states and
have not registered, living instead with host families or in
rented accommodation. Jordan alone told the UN that this may
amount to an additional 100,000 Syrians.  Syria , which has suffered a 21-month civil conflict, has a
population of about 22.5 million, according to the Central
Intelligence Agency  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
