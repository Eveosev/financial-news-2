Oil rose for the first time in six
days as German investor confidence jumped in December.  Prices rebounded from a three-week low as confidence in
 Germany , the European Union’s biggest oil user, reached a seven-
month high. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
will probably leave its production quota unchanged when
ministers meet tomorrow in Vienna, a Bloomberg survey showed.  “The improving German investor confidence put some support
in the market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “It’s also a result
of the fact that we’ve been down five days in a row. The market
is keeping an eye on tomorrow’s OPEC meeting to see if there is
anything unexpected coming out of it.”  Crude for January delivery rose 23 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to settle at $85.79 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract dropped to $85.56 yesterday, the lowest
close since Nov. 15. Prices are down 13 percent this year and
are headed for the first annual decrease since 2008.  Prices were little changed after the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported oil inventories increased 4.27 million
barrels to 375.8 million last week. Crude rose 20 cents to
$85.76 a barrel at 4:41 p.m. in electronic trading. It was at
$86.01 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent for January settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange gained 68 cents, or 0.6 percent, to end
the session at $108.01 a barrel.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its  index  of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, climbed
to 6.9 from minus 15.7 in November. Economists forecast a gain
to minus 11.5, according to the median of 38 estimates in a
 Bloomberg survey .  German Economy  ZEW’s gauge of the current economic situation rose to 5.7
from 5.4 in November.  “The German confidence reduced some concern about the
European economy,” said Bill Baruch, a senior market strategist
at Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “No one is making big bets in this
market before the OPEC meeting.”  The euro gained as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar
on the German sentiment report. A stronger euro and weaker
dollar increase dollar-denominated oil’s appeal as an investment
alternative.  “The German confidence is one of the reasons supporting
the market,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund
manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. “We do have an OPEC meeting
and we are kind of in a holding pattern right now.”  OPEC will probably maintain its production quota at 30
million barrels a day of oil, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Mohamed al-Hamli, the oil minister from the  United Arab
Emirates , said in Vienna today that there’s no need for OPEC to
do anything as long as there is demand.  OPEC Output  OPEC crude output tumbled to the lowest level in 11 months
in November as  Saudi Arabia , the group’s biggest producer,
pumped the least in 13 months, according to revised data in an
e-mailed report from the group.  Supply from the 12-member organization, which pumps about
40 percent of the world’s crude, dropped by 0.7 percent to 30.78
million barrels a day last month, the lowest level since
December 2011. That exceeds by 1.03 million barrels the amount
of OPEC crude that will be required by world markets in 2013,
the report showed.  The Energy Department will probably say tomorrow that U.S.
gasoline inventories increased 2 million barrels in the week
ended Dec. 7, according to a Bloomberg survey. Stockpiles jumped
7.86 million the previous week to 212.1 million as demand
weakened.  Gasoline Supply  “The build in gasoline is really keeping this market
down,” Baruch said. “People are really fearful of demand.”  Total products supplied , a measure of fuel demand, dropped
5.7 percent in the last two weeks of November, the Energy
Department reported last week.  Crude stockpiles dropped 2.5 million barrels last week, the
Bloomberg survey showed.  The Energy Department raised its crude-oil price projection
for 2013 in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook  today. West
Texas Intermediate oil will average $88.38 a barrel next year,
up from the $88.29 forecast last month, the Energy Information
Administration, the department’s statistical arm, said. Brent
will average $103.75, up from $103.38 last month.  The EIA increased its forecast for global oil consumption
next year to 90 million barrels a day from 89.94 million in
November. Demand will be 1.1 percent higher than this year’s
average of 89.04 million.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 419,171
contracts as of 4:42 p.m. Volume totaled 468,908 contracts
yesterday, 9.7 percent lower than the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.55 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
