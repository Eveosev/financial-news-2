Dollar General Corp. (DG) , the largest
U.S. dollar-store chain, fell the most in 18 months after saying
it will match rivals’ price cuts to retain customers that
analysts anticipate will spend more cautiously next year.  The shares  dropped  7.8 percent to $42.94 at the close in
 New York , the biggest one-day decline since June 1, 2011.
Smaller rivals  Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO)  and  Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR) 
fell 8.4 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively.  Dollar General, based in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, will
increase spending on promotions to spur sales of other popular
items such as coffee and cereal to consumers, Chief Executive
Officer Richard Dreiling said today on a conference call.
Americans face the possibility of more than $600 billion in tax
increases and government spending cuts next year.  “Every time you turn on the television, there’s a bunch of
guys in a suit who are frowning, telling you that the world is
going over a fiscal cliff,” Dreiling said. “The customer is
fatigued, they’re tired, they’re scared.”  Dollar General  was downgraded to neutral, the equivalent of
a hold recommendation, from buy by Denise Chai, an analyst at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, citing pressure on profit margins
due to increased competition.  Matthew Boss, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New
York, cut Matthews, North Carolina-based Family Dollar to the
equivalent of hold from buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
