Vodafone Group Plc’s (VOD)  global
enterprise unit is looking to entice more businesses to cloud
computing to combat effects of reduced information and
technology spending amid a harsh economic environment.  “The macro environment is still forcing companies to think
about how to spend on IT,” Vodafone Global Enterprise Chief
Executive Officer Jan Geldmacher said at the Bloomberg
Enterprise Technology Summit in  London  today. “The trend is
continuing that companies try to get costs down on IT, telecom
and communications.”  Geldmacher said some companies were scaling back too far,
limiting their strategic flexibility and are “losing the
race.”  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis has lead consumers and
businesses to cut spending and contributed to the company’s
first decline in service revenue in 10 quarters last period,
Vodafone said in November. Declines in Spain and Italy lead to a
5.9 billion pound ($9.5 billion) writedown.  Still, the global enterprise segment is healthy and one of
Vodafone’s fastest growing units, Geldmacher said. Vodafone
Global Enterprise serves the company’s largest multinational
accounts.  To combat tighter budgets, Newbury, England-based Vodafone
is expanding its offering for new technologies to these
customers, Geldmacher said. The company is working to convert
more businesses to cloud computing and virtualization services,
which give workers access to their data from anywhere, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
