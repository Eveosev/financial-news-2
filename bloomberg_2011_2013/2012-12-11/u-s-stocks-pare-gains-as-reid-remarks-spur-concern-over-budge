U.S. stocks pared gains as remarks
from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spurred concern that
lawmakers will not reach a budget agreement this month.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.7 percent at
1,428.19 at 2:54 p.m. after earlier climbing as much as 1.1
percent amid speculation Republicans and Democrats were making
progress in forging a deal to avert the fical cliff of budget
cuts and tax increases.  Equities trimmed gains as Reid told reporters that
Republicans were holding middle-class tax cuts “hostage” and
have offered no specifics on what they want in budget
negotiations. Reid, a Democrat from  Nevada , said it will be hard
to reach an agreement by Christmas, CNBC reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
