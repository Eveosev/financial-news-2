The  International Accounting
Standards Board  should stop trying to get the U.S. to adopt its
standards and instead focus on  China  and other countries that
are more willing to follow the rules, a U.K. group said.  The era of convergence between U.S. and international
standards “should be ended formally in a matter of months” the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and  Wales  said in
an e-mailed report. The IASB should look at “countries that
have moved their standards close” to its proposals, known as
IFRS.  Hans Hoogervorst , chairman of the IASB, last year
criticized the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board’s rules
that differ from IASB standards during a hearing in the European
Parliament in Brussels. U.S. rules, known as Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles or GAAP allow banks to be less transparent
about derivatives on their balance sheet, he said.  “It is better that the IASB and FASB boards issue separate
standards, than deliver unsatisfactory compromise solutions or
do nothing at all,” said Nigel Sleigh-Johnson, Head of ICAEW’s
Financial Reporting Faculty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
