Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
sold the largest structured note to pay coupons based on  two-
year  interest rate swaps in 20 months as the measure dropped to
the lowest point since at least 1999.  Britain’s biggest state-owned lender issued 43 million
euros ($55.6 million) of 5.5-year notes on Dec. 7 that pay
yields based on the cost of exchanging a series of fixed cash
flows denominated in euros for floating-rate payments in the
same currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors receive the swap rate, with a floor of 1.9
percent and a cap of 5 percent. The measure fell to 0.309 on
Dec. 10, the least since at least 1999, Bloomberg data show.  Only two other notes have been sold this year tied to the
two-year rate in euros, a 5 million euro security from  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  issued Oct. 4 and a 500,000 euro issue from HSH
Nordbank AG sold May 30, Bloomberg data show.  RBS’s note is the largest tied to the rate since  Germany ’s
Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen Girozentrale issued a 100 million-
euro security April 26, 2011, that pays the two-year swap rate,
with a floor of 3.25 percent, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
