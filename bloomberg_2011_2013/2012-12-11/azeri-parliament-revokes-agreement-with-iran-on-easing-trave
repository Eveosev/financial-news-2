Azerbaijan ’s lawmakers today revoked
a law that eased travel restrictions for Iranians living close
to the former Soviet republic’s border, said Akif Tavakkuloglu,
a spokesman for the parliament in the capital, Baku.  Azeris and Iranians residing within 45 kilometers (28
miles) of the border were allowed to visit the neighboring
country without a visa, based on agreements signed in 2005 and
2006. Tehran allowed visa-free travel for all Azeri nationals in
November 2009, which Baku didn’t reciprocate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
