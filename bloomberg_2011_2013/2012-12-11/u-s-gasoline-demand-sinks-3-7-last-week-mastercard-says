U.S. gasoline demand slid 3.7
percent last week to the lowest level since Nov. 16, according
to data from  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 8.52 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended Dec. 7, down from 8.84 million in the prior
period, MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed. The decline
follows a gain of 0.1 percent in the seven days ended Nov. 30.  The four-week average in the week ended Dec. 7 was 2.4
percent below a year earlier. It has been down from the previous
year every week except one since March 18, 2011. Year-to-date
fuel consumption is 3.6 percent below the same period in 2011.  The lowest demand this year through Oct. 26 was 8.01
million barrels on Feb. 10. The highest level reached was 9.36
million on May 25.  The average pump price fell 4 cents in the past week to
$3.38 a gallon, the cheapest since the week ended July 13, the
report showed. Drivers are paying 2.7 percent more than a year
earlier. Prices reached a year-to-date peak of $3.94 on April 6.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
