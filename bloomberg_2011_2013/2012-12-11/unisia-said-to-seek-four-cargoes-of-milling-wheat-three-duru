Tunisia’s state grains office is
seeking to buy four cargoes of milling wheat and three of durum,
each holding 25,000 metric tons, according to two traders with
direct knowledge of the tender.  The office wants the shipments, depending on the origin,
for delivery from Jan. 15 to Feb. 25, said the traders, who
asked not to be named because they aren’t authorized to speak to
the media. The deadline for bids is tomorrow, they said.  Durum is the hard variety of wheat used to make couscous, a
staple dish in western North Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
