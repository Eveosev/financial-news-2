Belden Inc. (BDC) , a St. Louis-based maker
of networking equipment, acquired PPC for $515.7 million to add
products for broadband services.  PPC, a closely held manufacturer of connectivity
technologies for Internet-service providers, will help Belden
expand into new markets, according to a statement today. PPC,
based in Syracuse, New York, had revenue of about $238 million
in 2012, and the deal will boost earnings in 2013 by 54 cents,
excluding some items, Belden said.  “PPC provides innovative products that enable our
customers to profitably grow their business by delivering higher
bandwidth and enhanced services, with fewer service calls,”
Belden Chief Executive Office John Stroup said in the statement.  Belden also reiterated its fourth-quarter and full-year
earnings forecast. The company expects annual sales to be $1.94
billion to $1.95 billion, while adjusted income from continuing
operations will be $3 to $3.05 a share.  Belden rose 6.5 percent to $42.27 at the close in New York,
the biggest one-day jump since Aug. 3. The shares have advanced
27 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
