Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  surged to a
record high after Susquehanna Financial Group raised its price
estimate for the shares, citing growth prospects as corporate
customers do more computing tasks over the Internet.  The shares rose 4.2 percent to $165 in New York, for the
highest closing price since the company’s initial public
offering in June 2004. The  stock  extended gains for the year to
63 percent.  Salesforce, the largest maker of online customer-management
software, is benefiting as businesses increasingly rely on
cloud-computing to access and analyze data, Derrick Wood, an
analyst at Susquehanna, wrote in a research report today. He
raised his price estimate for the San Francisco-based company to
$185 from $175.  “Cloud-computing remains a top priority,” Wood said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
