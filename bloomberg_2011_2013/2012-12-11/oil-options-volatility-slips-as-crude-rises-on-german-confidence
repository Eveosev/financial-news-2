Crude options volatility slid as oil
rose after German investor confidence jumped to a seven-month
high in December and OPEC members gathered in Vienna to discuss
production levels.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.37 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 3:40 p.m. local time, down from 27.87
percent yesterday.  Crude for January delivery advanced 0.3 percent to $85.79 a
barrel on the Nymex after five days of declines.  An index by the ZEW Center for European Economic Research
of investor confidence in  Germany  rose more than expected on
speculation the economy will gather momentum next year. The
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will probably
leave its production quota unchanged when oil ministers meet
tomorrow, a Bloomberg survey showed.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
February $105 calls, which fell 1 cent to 10 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,178 lots. January $85 puts were next, with 1,876
contracts exchanging hands as they fell 29 cents to 54 cents.  Trading was almost evenly split between puts and calls.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets made up 56 percent of
the 113,076 contracts exchanged.  February $110 calls were the most active options yesterday,
with 7,817 lots traded. They fell 1 cent to 7 cents a barrel.
February $105 calls were next, dropping 1 cent to 11 cents a
barrel on volume of 5,877.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
45,794 contracts. Next were January $60 puts at 34,922 lots and
January $110 calls at 31,399 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
