Hungary’s three-year bond yields
declined to the lowest in 2 1/2 years as the inflation rate
dropped to an 11-month low, giving the central bank more room to
continue cutting  interest rates .  The yields dropped four basis points to 5.78 percent, the
lowest since the end of May 2010. The forint appreciated 0.3
percent to 282.55 per euro by 10:11 a.m. in Budapest.  The inflation rate fell to 5.2 percent in November, the
lowest since December, from 6 percent in October, compared with
the central bank’s 3 percent target, the statistics office in
Budapest said today. The median estimate of 18 economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for 5.5 percent. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank’s
benchmark rate is 6 percent, still the EU’s highest, after
policy makers reduced it by a  cumulative  one percentage point in
the past four months.  “The slowing inflation path may support the continuation
of central bank rate cuts,” Zoltan Reczey and Gergely Palffy,
analysts at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in a research report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
