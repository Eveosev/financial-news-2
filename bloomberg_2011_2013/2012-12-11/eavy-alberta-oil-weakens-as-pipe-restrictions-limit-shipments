Heavy Alberta oil weakened because
of Midwest plant shutdowns and limited space on pipelines that
move the crude to U.S. refiners.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  apportioned oil shipments for December on
portions of Lines 4 and 67 in aggregate by 13 percent, the
company said Nov. 26.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting, Indiana, refinery shut
Pipestill 12, the largest crude unit at the plant, for planned
work that is expected to be completed by the middle of next
year, a person familiar with the situation said Nov. 5.  The discount for Western Canada Select for January delivery
versus West Texas Intermediate widened $2.50 a barrel to $35 a
barrel at 1:27 p.m.  New York  time, according to  Net Energy Inc .,
a Calgary oil broker.  Syncrude’s premium for January delivery narrowed 20 cents
to $1.80 a barrel above WTI, Net Energy said. The same grade for
December delivery gained $2.75 to a $2.35 premium above the U.S.
benchmark.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast, West Texas Sour weakened 25 cents
to a $15.75-a-barrel discount to WTI, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg at 1:54 p.m. in New York.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 70 cents a barrel
to $23.45 above WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s rose 40 cents to
$22.75.  Poseidon’s premium widened 55 cents to $18.10. Mars Blend
increased 65 cents to $17.75 a barrel over WTI, and Southern
Green Canyon gained 35 cents to an $18.10 premium.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
was unchanged at $20 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
