The University of Virginia was
sanctioned by its accrediting board today over the failed ouster
of the school’s president six months ago.  The Atlanta-based  Southern Association of Colleges and
Schools Commission on Colleges , a regional body that accredits
higher-education institutions, put the school on warning for a
year, President Belle S. Wheelan said from the group’s annual
meeting in  Dallas .  Teresa Sullivan was forced out as president in June without
discussion or a vote by the full board. She was reinstated weeks
later after an uproar by faculty and students.  “Being on warning is a public sanction, and it tells the
general public that the university has got a problem,” Wheelan
said in a telephone interview. “That tends to raise eyebrows”
in the world of academics.  The university, based in Charlottesville, was found to be
out of compliance over two standards, Wheelan said. The board
shouldn’t be controlled by a minority of members and the school
should have a policy that defines the role of faculty in
governance, she said.  A special committee will do further investigation and will
report back to the accreditation board in a year, Wheelan said.  In a letter to parents and alumni, the university called
the decision “disappointing” and said it “pledges to work
diligently to address the concerns cited by the commission.”  The University of Virginia is still a fully accredited
institution and can participate in federal aid programs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
