Manchester City midfielder Gareth
Barry was charged with using abusive language toward officials
after the 3-2 loss to  Manchester United  two days ago.  The player has until 4 p.m. on Dec. 13 to respond to the
charge, England’s Football Association, the sport’s governing
body, said today on its website.  United won the match at City’s Etihad Stadium with a late
goal from  Robin van Persie  after the hosts came back from two
goals down. City officials are trying to identify members of the
crowd who threw objects onto the field, including a coin that
hit United defender Rio Ferdinand near his eye.  To contact the reporter on this story:
