Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in three days, as increasing German investor
confidence spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 declined four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.95 percent at 3:24 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price climbed 0.27
centimo to 125.36 centimos per sol.  Global stocks rose and U.S. Treasuries fell on optimism
Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, will withstand the region’s
debt crisis. German investor confidence jumped more than
economists anticipated in December, according to the ZEW Center
for European Economic Research in Mannheim.  Increased demand for Peru’s debt reflects “the improvement
in global risk sentiment,” said  Diego Donadio , a Latin America
strategist at BNP Paribas in  Sao Paulo .  Peru’s economy will expand 6.3 percent this year, Finance
Minister Miguel Castilla said at an event in Lima today. He
previously forecast growth of about 6 percent.  The sol was little changed at percent to 2.5755 per  U.S.
dollar  at today’s close, according to price compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank bought $60 million in the spot
market today and said on its website it paid an average 2.5722
soles per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
