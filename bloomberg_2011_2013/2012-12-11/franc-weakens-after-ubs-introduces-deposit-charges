Switzerland ’s franc weakened against
the euro after  UBS AG (UBSN) , the nation’s biggest bank, said it will
charge a levy on its financial-institution customers who hold
cash balances in the currency from Dec. 21.  “Due to the continued prevailing market situation
affecting the Swiss franc, we have decided to take additional
corrective actions,” UBS said in a notice published on the
Swift system yesterday. “As a consequence, we will start
applying a charge for credit balances maintained by financial
institutions in their Swiss franc accounts with UBS in Zurich.”  The franc fell 0.3 percent to 1.2111 per euro at 10:21 a.m.
London time, after depreciating as much as 0.4 percent to
1.2127, the weakest since Dec. 6. It was little changed at 93.38
centimes per dollar.  The  Swiss National Bank  in September last year imposed a
ceiling of 1.20 francs per euro to protect the nation’s
exporters as investors seeking a haven from the euro-area debt
crisis sent the currency to a record. The Zurich-based central
bank declined to comment on today’s decision by UBS.  The franc slid to its lowest level against the euro in
almost three months last week after  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  on
Dec. 3 announced plans to introduce charges on franc balances.  UBS said its levy would be communicated individually to
clients within days, adding that “we encourage our customers to
keep their Swiss-franc balances as low as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
