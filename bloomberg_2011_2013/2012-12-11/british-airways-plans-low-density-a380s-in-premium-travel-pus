British Airways’ fleet of 12 Airbus
SAS A380s will feature a lower seating density than superjumbos
operated by its biggest competitors as the U.K. carrier seeks to
maximize its share of lucrative premium bookings.  The aircraft, due to be delivered starting in July, will
have 469 seats in a four-class layout, London-based BA said in a
statement.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s A380s have the most berths at
526, while  Air France (AF) ’s planes can accommodate 516 passengers.  British Airways is also looking at providing a first-class
cabin in the stretched version of  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s Dreamliner, the
787-9, of which the International Consolidated Airlines Group SA
unit has 16 on order. The baseline 787-8, of which BA is taking
eight starting in May, will have 214 seats in three classes.  “By next spring we will have finished installing our new
first cabins,” Chief Executive Willy Walsh said in the release,
adding that feedback from passengers on six 777-300ERs already
fitted with the berths, which cost 100 million pounds ($161
million) to develop, has been its most-positive ever.  Korean Air Lines Co. has the lowest-density superjumbo
layout, accommodating 407 passengers. The  British Airways (IAG)  A380s
will feature 14 seats in an enhanced version of its first-class
cabin located on the superjumbo’s main deck.  French Fleet  The plane will also have 97 Club World business berths, 44
of them on the main deck in a 2:4:2 layout and 53 on the upper
deck, split 2:3:2. There will also be 55 premium economy seats
on that deck, plus 303 in economy split across both levels.  Air France has ordered the same number of superjumbos as BA
and had taken delivery of eight planes by the end of November.
Lufthansa has 17 A380s on order and has received 10 to date.  French planes operating routes such as Paris to Washington
DC have nine seats in first class, 80 in business, 38 in premium
economy and 389 in coach.  Dubai-based Emirates, the biggest A380 customer with 90
planes on order, has two cabin configurations featuring 489 and
517 seats. All aircraft have 14 first-class berths and 76 in
business class, with a variable number of economy seats.  BA’s 787-8s will feature 35 business seats, 25 in premium
economy and 154 in coach.  All new jets will feature  Thales SA (HO)  inflight entertainment
systems offering 50 percent more movies than  Rockwell Collins
Inc. (COL)  technology fitted on the current fleet of Boeing 747s, 767s
and most 777-200s. There will also be double the number of TV
shows, audio programs and music tracks, plus bigger screens and
links for personal devices in all cabins for the first time.  British Airways will take nine new long-haul planes during
the year, becoming the first European carrier to operate both
the A380 and 787. Deliveries will comprise four Dreamliners,
three superjumbos and two 777-300ERs. The routes that they’ll
operate will be announced in the spring.  To contact the reporters on this story:
