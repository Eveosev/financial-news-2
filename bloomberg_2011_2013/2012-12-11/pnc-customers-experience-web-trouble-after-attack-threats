PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) 
customers may be experiencing difficulty logging in to the
bank’s website after a group yesterday threatened renewed cyber
attacks on some of the biggest U.S. lenders.  “We are focused on minimizing disruption to our customers
but will be reviewing the cause of this incident,” said Amy Vargo, a spokeswoman for Pittsburgh-based PNC.  The al Qassam Cyber Fighters Group threatened this week to
target banks’ websites in retaliation for an anti-Muslim film,
 American Banker  reported earlier today.  PNC, the seventh-largest U.S. bank by deposits, declined to
comment on whether the service disruptions were the result of
cyber attacks. “We are aware of the situation and working to
restore full access,” Vargo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
