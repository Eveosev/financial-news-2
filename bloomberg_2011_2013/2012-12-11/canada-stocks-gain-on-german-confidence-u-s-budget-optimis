Wealth Management, referring to Italian Prime Minister  Mario
Monti  announcing on Dec. 9 his plan to resign. The firm, based

leveraged through the U.S., so if it’s good for Europe it’s
really good for the States and somewhat good for Canada.”  Lawmakers returned to  Washington  today amid a potential
thaw in the U.S. fiscal policy dispute. U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner  said on the House floor today in Washington he is
“hopeful” policymakers will reach a budget agreement before
the end of the year, while calling for U.S. President  Barack Obama  to offer proposed spending cuts as part of a compromise.  German Confidence  German investor confidence jumped more than economists
forecast to a seven-month high in December on speculation

Bank of Canada, the nation’s largest lender, added 0.8 percent
to C$58.97 as bank stocks  contributed  most to gains in the

average at this time of the day.  Precision Drilling climbed 6.6 percent to C$8.22 after it
said yesterday it will begin paying a quarterly dividend of 5
Canadian cents in the fourth quarter of 2012, payable Dec. 28.
The Calgary-based driller has also cut its capital spending in
2013 to C$485 million from about C$920 million in 2012.  Petrobank rose 2.8 percent to C$11.93 and Canadian Natural

BlackBerry 10 smartphone next February, rose 5 percent to

announced its 2013 budget yesterday and a plan to sell C$800
million in shares.  Michael Dunn , analyst with FirstEnergy, said the company’s
production guidance of 32,000 to 35,000 barrels a day was in
line with his expectations, but capital spending of C$1.9
billion was “materially higher” than he estimated. He has
lowered his rating for MEG to market perform from outperform,
while also cutting his price target to C$41 from C$47.  To contact the reporter on this story:
