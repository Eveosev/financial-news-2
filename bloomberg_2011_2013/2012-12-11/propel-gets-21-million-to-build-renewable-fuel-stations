Propel Fuels Inc., a closely held
retailer of ethanol and biodiesel blends, received $21 million
in financing to expand its network of biofuel stations.  Gentry Venture Partners and existing investors Nth Power
LLC, Craton Equity Partners and @Ventures provided $11 million
in equity capital as part of the company’s Series D financing
round, Propel said in a statement on its website today. It also
received $10 million in debt and didn’t identify the provider.  Propel, based in Redwood City,  California , operates 24 fuel
stations in California and six in Washington. The funding will
help it expand to about 75 locations within a year, Chief
Executive Officer Matt Horton said in a phone interview. The
U.S. Energy Department and the  California Energy Commission  have
awarded Propel $22 million in grants to expand its network, and
the private investments will provide some of the required
matching funds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
