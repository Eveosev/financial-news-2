The Swiss franc declined against the
euro after UBS AG followed Credit Suisse Group AG in saying it
will charge bank clients for deposits made in the currency.  The franc declined as much as 0.2 percent to 1.2107 per
euro, before trading 0.1 percent weaker at 1.2091 as of 7:29
a.m. London time.  The charges, which will apply from Dec. 21, will be
communicated in “coming days,” and depend on individual clients,
UBS spokesman Samuel Brandner said in a telephone interview.  The dollar was little changed at $1.2944 per euro, and
82.38 yen. The euro traded at 106.64 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
