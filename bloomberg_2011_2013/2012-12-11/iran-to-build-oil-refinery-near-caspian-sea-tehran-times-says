The Iranian Oil Ministry plans to
build a refinery near the Caspian Sea that will process crude
from the Sardar Jangal field, the Tehran Times reported, citing
Masoud Jahdi, the explorations director of Khazar Oil Co.  The field, which is located in the Caspian Sea, has about 2
billion barrels of reserves, of which 500 million barrels is
recoverable, Jahdi said, according to the Tehran-based
newspaper. The crude has a density of 41 degrees on the American
Petroleum Institute scale, he said. “The refinery will meet
demands of highly populated areas in northern  Iran ,” Jahdi
said, according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
