Police arrested a Somali-born man
and are pursuing another suspected of planting a bag with
potentially explosive material at the main train station in the
German city of Bonn yesterday,  General Anzeiger Bonn  reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  Police arrested the man, identified as Omar D., shortly
after 1:30 p.m. in the city center today, according to the
report. Authorities are searching for a second suspect 30 to 35
years old, the newspaper said.  Bonn’s main train station was temporarily shut yesterday
after the discovery of the bag, which contained “potentially
explosive material,” Ulrich Fassbender, a spokesman for the
Cologne police in charge of the investigation, said by phone.
It’s not clear whether the material was a functional explosive
device, he said. Fassbender declined to confirm or deny whether
arrests had been made or provide further details.  Rail travel across the country was disrupted as police
cordoned off the station to blow up the bag using a water jet,
the newspaper said.  While the federal criminal office is involved in the
exchange of information on the case, it’s not leading the
investigation and therefore can’t comment, a spokeswoman for the
office said today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
