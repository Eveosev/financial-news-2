Serbian corn harvested this year is
not severely contaminated by aflatoxins, state-owned Tanjug news
agency said, citing the Ministry of Agriculture.  Only 7 percent of the tested sample is contaminated by
aflatoxins, Tanjug cited Nenad Katanic, the head of the
Agriculture Inspectorate, as saying. Anyone anyone who
“disseminated irresponsible, rushed and damaging statements
about the corn contamination, which is the strategic commodity
for  Serbia , will bear adequate consequences,” he said.  Specialists from the Belgrade arm of  SGS SA (SGSN) , a Swiss
industrial inspection and testing company, said on Nov. 30 that
one-third of the corn is safe for human consumption and half is
safe for  animal feed . They tested almost 400 samples, or 10
percent of this year’s crop, for aflatoxins, which are produced
by fungi and considered carcinogenic to humans and animals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
