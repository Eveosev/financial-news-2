The cotton crop in the U.S.,
the world’s largest exporter, will be 1.1 percent smaller
than forecast last month because of lower yields, the
government said.  Production may total 17.26 million bales, down from
17.45 million projected in November, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. The average estimate of
eight analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was 17.55
million. The previous crop totaled 15.57 million bales,
each weighing 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Cotton has plunged 67 percent from a record $2.197 a
pound in March 2011 as higher prices eroded demand and
boosted global production. The March contract closed
yesterday down 0.5 percent to 73.4 cents a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York .  Yields may reach 793 pounds per acre, down from 802
projected last month. The yield was 790 pounds in the
previous year, the USDA said.  U.S. growers may export 11.8 million bales in the
marketing year that began Aug. 1, up from 11.71 million in
the previous season, the USDA said. Unsold supplies at the
end of the year will total 5.4 million bales, up 61 percent
from 3.35 million a year earlier, according to the report.  World output will reach 116.90 million bales, down 5.9
from 124.27 million in the previous season, the USDA said.
Last month’s estimate was 116.83 million bales.  Consumption will total 106.48 million bales, up 3.2
percent from 103.21 million last year, the department said.  Global stockpiles on July 31, 2013, may total 79.64
million bales, down 0.8 percent from 80.27 million forecast
in November, the USDA said.  Estimated inventories in  China , the biggest user of
the fiber, at the end of this marketing year will be 37.61
million bales, up 1.3 percent from the November estimate of
37.11 million, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
