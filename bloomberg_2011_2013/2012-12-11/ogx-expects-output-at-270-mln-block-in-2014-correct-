OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA ,
Latin America’s third-largest oil producer by market value,
expects output to start in late 2014 at a recently acquired
offshore Brazilian block, the company’s press office said in an
e-mailed statement.  OGX, which is controlled by its billionaire Chairman  Eike Batista ,  acquired  a 40 percent stake in the 1,500 meter deep
block for $270 million from  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  last month.
The block holds 2.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent of so-
called in-place reserves at the Atlanta and Oliva oil fields,
according to OGX data.  QGEP Participacoes SA (QGEP3) , the operator of the block, has said
it expects to drill the first well next year, start producing in
late 2014 and reach full development between 2017 and 2018. QGEP
owns 30 percent while Barra Energia Petroleo & Gas owns the
remaining 30 percent.  OGX is planning to drill 11 wells in two basins next year
and three more with partner Perenco SA in the Espirito Santo
basin. The company also plans to seek new clients for its oil
after closing a deal to deliver 800,000 barrels of crude to
 Chile ’s state-controlled Empresa Nacional de Petroleo in January
as it seeks to diversify its customers. OGX this year sold oil
shipments to  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
