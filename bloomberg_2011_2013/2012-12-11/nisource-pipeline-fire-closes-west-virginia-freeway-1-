Natural gas  escaping from a pipeline
owned by  NiSource Inc. (NI)  caused a fire that closed an interstate
freeway and burned houses near Sissonville, West Virginia.  The fire was reported about 1 p.m. local time near the
Lanham Compressor Station on the Columbia Gas Transmission
system, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of Charleston, Anna
Kaplan, a spokeswoman for NiSource, wrote in an e-mail today.  Flames reached three houses and forced local officials to
divert drivers from Interstate 77, said Dale Petry, Kanawha
County emergency management director.  NiSource is based in Merrillville,  Indiana .  “The flames were shooting across the interstate to where
they couldn’t even see,” Petry said in a telephone interview.  The fire has been contained and no customers were affected,
NiSource’s Kaplan wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
