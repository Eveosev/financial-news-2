The cost of insuring corporate bonds
from non-payment in  Japan  and  Australia  rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1.5 basis points to
170.5 basis points as of 9:16 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The index, which has ranged from 165 basis points
to 229.5 basis points since June 30, advanced 4.8 basis points
last week, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 0.5 of a basis
point to 127.5 as of 11:16 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The measure has ranged from 126.6 to 186 this
half, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 114 basis points
as of 8:15 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge rose 2.4 basis points last week,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
