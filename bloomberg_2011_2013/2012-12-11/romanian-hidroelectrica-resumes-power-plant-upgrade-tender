Romania ’s  Hidroelectrica SA  called
for bids to upgrade its Stejaru power plant for about 110
million euros ($130 million) after the project’s financing was
suspended because of the company’s insolvency.  The state-owned hydro-power generator plans to use a credit
from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS)  and  CaixaBank (CABK)  to finance the modernization of the
50-year-old plant, Hidroelectrica said in an e-mailed statement
today. The lenders suspended the funding, secured in July 2011,
after Hidroelectrica entered an insolvency procedure in June as
part of a government restructuring plan.  The EBRD will provide 70 million euros for the project,
while the other two commercial banks will lend 20 million euros
each, Hidroelectrica said.  An official announcement for the international tender will
be published on the European Union’s Procurement Journal,
Hidroelectrica said. The tender will begin in the first quarter
of next year, the EBRD said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
