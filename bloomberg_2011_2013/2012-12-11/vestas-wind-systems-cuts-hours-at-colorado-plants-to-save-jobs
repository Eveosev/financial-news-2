Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
biggest wind-turbine maker, cut working hours at two Colorado
plants to save jobs.  Employees paid by the hour at blade-manufacturing factories
in Windsor and Brighton were told yesterday they’ll have their
working week cut to 32 hours from 40 hours, Aarhus, Denmark-
based Vestas said today in an e-mailed statement. The company
didn’t disclose how many workers were affected.  “The work-share plan gives Vestas manufacturing
flexibility, helps to retain our valuable and experienced
employees, and saves costs on recruiting or training new staff
if market demand for  wind turbines  increases in 2013,” Vestas
said. “This decision helps preserve jobs.”  Vestas is trying to prepare its operations in the U.S. for
a slowdown in production next year as orders have dropped before
a tax credit supporting wind projects expires this year. The
company predicts global shipments will total 5 gigawatts next
year, down from about 6.3 gigawatts in 2012.  The expiring production tax credit provides an incentive of
2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour for wind power. Vestas is cutting more
than 6,000 jobs over two years and has said that the loss of the
tax credit puts 1,600 jobs at risk in the U.S.  The work-share plan was approved by the Colorado Department
of Labor and Employment and workers will receive payment for the
lost hours from an unemployment insurance trust fund, Vestas
said. Its statement confirmed an earlier report by the  Denver
Post .  To contact the reporter on this story:
