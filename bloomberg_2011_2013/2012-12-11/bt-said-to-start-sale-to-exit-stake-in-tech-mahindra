BT Group Plc (BT/A) , Britain’s biggest
fixed-line phone company, is exiting  Tech Mahindra Ltd. (TECHM)  through
a sale of shares to institutional investors to raise at least
9.9 billion rupees ($183 million), according to a term sheet
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The minimum price for the shares has been set at 855
rupees, representing a 2.8 percent discount to the last closing
price in Mumbai, the terms showed. BT had a 9.1 percent stake in
the Indian technology services provider before yesterday’s share
sale, the terms showed.  BT raised an initial 13.9 billion rupees through a sale of
a 14.1 percent stake in Tech Mahindra in August.  Indian companies raised 404 billion rupees in share sales
this year, compared with 296 billion rupees raised in 2011, as
stakeholders including  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Temasek Holdings Pte
sold shares in local companies, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  are
managing BT’s stake sale, said two people familiar with the
matter who asked not to be named before an announcement.
Officials at Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and BT declined to comment
on the sale.  Tech Mahindra’s  shares  rose 0.6 percent to 879.5 rupees at
the close of trade in Mumbai. They have gained 53 percent since
the start of the year, compared with a 25 percent increase in
the benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
