East African Portland Cement Ltd. (EAPC) ,
the smallest of  Kenya ’s three publicly traded makers of the
building material, plunged the most in almost six weeks on bets
it will make a loss in the first half.  The stock plummeted by the maximum daily limit of 10
percent to close at 38.25 shillings in the capital, Nairobi, the
steepest decline since Oct. 31, when the company reported a
full-year loss. About 91,000 shares traded or seven times the
three-month daily average volume.  “We still believe the company will make a loss in the half
year to December unless they do something drastic,” Halima Saadia, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Old Mutual
Securities Ltd. said in a phone interview.  In the year through June the loss was 821.5 million
shillings ($9.57 million), compared with a profit of 1.72
million shillings a year earlier. Sales dropped 16 percent to
8.61 billion shillings, hurt by “extraordinary turbulence” in
the period, the company said.  Management wrangles and a dispute on directorship will
partly contribute to the dismal performance of the company,
Saadia said.  In January the industry regulator suspended trading in the
shares to give the company time to resolve management disputes.
The suspension was lifted in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
