Croatian borrowers with loans in
Swiss francs are suing commercial banks over contracts allowing
the banks to charge a variable  interest rate  on monthly loan
payments,  state radio  reported, citing people from the
borrowersâ€™ association.  The  Merchant Court  in Zagreb has accepted the suit in which
about 120,000 borrowers are suing eight commercial banks in
 Croatia , the radio said today. The claimants want the banks to
limit the application of the so-called foreign-currency clause,
according to the public broadcaster.  About a quarter of loans in Croatia are pegged to the Swiss
franc, according to the central bank. Loans denominated in euros
have not been affected by currency fluctuations as the national
currency, kuna, is pegged to the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
