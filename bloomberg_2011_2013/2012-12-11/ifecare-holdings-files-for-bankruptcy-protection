LifeCare Holdings Inc., an operator
of acute-care hospitals owned by  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , filed for
 bankruptcy protection , citing debt and losses from  Hurricane
Katrina  and saying it plans to sell the company.  LifeCare, based in Plano, Texas, listed assets of
$422 million as of Sept. 30 and liabilities of $576 million in
its Chapter 11 filing today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Wilmington, Delaware.  The bankruptcy was caused in part by “a significant and
unforeseen setback” from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which
destroyed three facilities in  New Orleans , Chairman Phillip B. Douglas said in court papers. Cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursements compounded financial problems, he said.  LifeCare, which took on about $400 million of debt to help
Carlyle fund its 2005 buyout, spent $57.7 million on interest
last year, double its total for 2010.  LifeCare said in a court filing that months of negotiations
with potential buyers failed to secure an offer that would fully
pay $353.4 million owing on a secured credit facility where
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA is agent. The company intends to hold an
auction where the first-lien lenders will bid using debt rather
than cash.  Phillips said the company has 27 hospitals in 10 states,
with about 4,500 employees. It was founded in 1992 and opened
its first hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana, the following year.  Care Continues  The company said patient care will continue without
interruption.  Among the company’s largest unsecured creditors listed in
court papers are holders of $128 million in subordinated notes
from U.S. Bank NA; and Vibra Healthcare LLC, owed $2.5 million
from a promissory note.  The main case is In re LCI Holding Co. Inc., 12-13319, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
