Former U.S. Congressman Wester Cooley was sentenced to one year and a day in prison following
his guilty plea last year to hiding $494,000 in income from the
 Internal Revenue Service .  Cooley, 80, was also ordered to pay $138,470 in back taxes
and $3.5 million in restitution to the victims of an investment-
fraud scheme he was accused of being part of, according to a
statement today by the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles.  Cooley, a Republican, represented Oregon’s second
Congressional District from 1995 to 1997. He was accused in 2009
of helping to bilk investors out of more than $10 million by
selling unregistered stock of Bidbay.com, of which Cooley was
vice president, under the pretext that  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  would be buying
the company.  He pleaded guilty last year to one count of filing a false
 tax return , in exchange for which prosecutors dropped the other
charges against him and agreed to seek no more than one year in
prison at his sentencing.  Steve Escovar, Cooley’s lawyer, said in a phone interview
that his client will probably serve his sentence at the Federal
Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina.  “The sentence took into consideration his present medical
condition,” the lawyer said.  The case is U.S. v. Cooley, 09-00084, U.S. District Court,
Central District of  California  ( Los Angeles .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
