The following is the text of the
wholesale inventories report from the Commerce Department.  Notice: For information on Hurricane Sandy’s impact on the
compilation of this report, please see our website at
< http://www.census.gov/wholesale >.  Sales  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that October 2012
sales of merchant wholesalers, except manufacturers’ sales
branches and offices, after adjustment for seasonal variations
and trading-day differences but not for price changes, were
$408.5 billion, down 1.2 percent (+/-0.7) from the revised
September level, but were up 2.3 percent (+/-1.1%) from the
October 2011 level. The September preliminary estimate was
revised downward $0.5 billion or 0.1 percent. October sales of
durable goods were down 0.9 percent (+/-1.1%)* from last month,
but were up 1.5 percent (+/-1.4%) from a year ago. Sales of
 motor vehicle  and motor vehicle parts and supplies were down 3.1
percent from last month. Sales of nondurable goods were down 1.4
percent (+/-1.2%) from September, but were up 3.0 percent (+/-
1.4%) from last October. Sales of petroleum and petroleum
products were down 5.7 percent from last month.  Inventories  Total inventories of merchant wholesalers, except
manufacturers’ sales branches and offices, after adjustment for
seasonal variations but not for price changes, were $497.1
billion at the end of October, up 0.6 percent (+/-0.4%) from the
revised September level and were up 6.6 percent (+/-1.1%) from
the October 2011 level. The September preliminary estimate was
revised upward $0.2 billion. October inventories of durable
goods were up 1.0 percent (+/-0.4%) from last month and were up
8.4 percent (+/-1.1%) from a year ago. Inventories of computer
and computer peripheral equipment and software were up 3.0
percent from last month and inventories of lumber and other
construction materials were up 1.8 percent. Inventories of
nondurable goods were down 0.1 percent (+/-0.9%)* from September,
but were up 4.0 percent (+/-2.1%) from last October. Inventories
of petroleum and petroleum products were down 3.1 percent from
last month.  Inventories/Sales Ratio  The October inventories/sales ratio for merchant
wholesalers, except manufacturers’ sales branches and offices,
based on seasonally adjusted data, was 1.22. The October 2011
ratio was 1.17. Data in this report are based on a sample and,
therefore, are subject to sampling and nonsampling error.  A discussion of the reliability of the estimates and
general survey methodology can be found at:

Trade Survey  Can the Census Bureau estimate the effect of Hurricane
Sandy on the estimates published in the October 2012 Monthly
Wholesale Trade Survey?  No. We cannot isolate the effect of Hurricane Sandy on the
Monthly Wholesale Trade Survey (MWTS) estimates since the sample
is designed to measure wholesale activity at the national level
and not at specific geographic areas.  Even though we cannot isolate the effect, we did receive
indications from companies that the hurricane had both positive
and negative effects on the wholesale data. Some firms reported
a drop in sales or increased inventories due to power outages
and closures. Other firms reported decreased inventories due to
damages suffered from the storm. In addition, many firms
reported that they were not affected by Hurricane Sandy.  Please see
 http://www.census.gov/newsroom/emergencies/sandy.html  for data
from the 2007 Economic Census and other Census Bureau sources on
the areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy.  Can the Census Bureau produce monthly wholesale trade
estimates for the affected areas?  No. We cannot separately estimate monthly wholesale sales
or inventories data for the affected areas since the MWTS sample
is designed to estimate data for the national level only.  Was the Census Bureau able to collect information from
firms operating within the affected areas?  Yes, but we received fewer responses than we usually
receive from companies in the affected areas. However, many
large, regional, and other multi‐location firms with reporting
offices outside the affected areas responded at a normal rate.
For the entire survey, we received 2,510 responses this month,
compared to the previous 12‐month range of 2,486 to 2,543
responses.  Did the Census Bureau change its data collection procedures
this month?  Yes. Our data collection staff asked additional questions
with regard to the impact of Hurricane Sandy on October 2012
data as part of our regular follow-up.  As a result of Hurricane Sandy, did the Census Bureau
modify its usual weighting or estimation methods used to produce
monthly wholesale estimates for October 2012?  No. Because the sample is designed to measure wholesale
data at the national level and not at specific geographic areas,
there is not sufficient evidence to support a change.  Has the reliability of the monthly wholesale estimates
changed because of Hurricane Sandy?  No, the reliability of the monthly wholesale estimates as
measured by the coefficient of variation for monthly totals and
the standard error for month-to-month change has not changed
substantially. For the published industries, reported data for
October 2012 exhibited variation similar to that for prior
months.  Did the Census Bureau alter the parameters input to the
seasonal adjustment program to produce monthly wholesale
estimates for October 2012?  No, the monthly review process of the seasonal adjustment
output and diagnostics did not indicate that adjustments to the
parameters were necessary for this month.  Did the Census Bureau change its analytical procedures for
the October 2012 Monthly Wholesale Trade Survey?  Yes. In addition to the usual analysis done every month, we
reviewed independent data sources and discussed the effect of
the hurricane with companies on the survey.  What activities are the Census Bureau planning to ensure
the affected areas will continue to be accurately represented?  As part of our data collection, we will continue to ask
questions that will help us monitor impacts from the affected
areas. We will monitor data responses and make adjustments if
necessary.  Last Revised: December 11, 2012  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.
