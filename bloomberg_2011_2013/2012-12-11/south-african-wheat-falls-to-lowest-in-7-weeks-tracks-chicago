South African wheat futures dropped
to the lowest in seven weeks, tracking the price of the grain in
the U.S. Corn also fell.  Wheat for delivery in March, the most active contract,
declined 0.6 percent to 3,698 rand ($426) a metric ton, the
lowest since Oct. 22 on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg.  Wheat dropped to the lowest level in five months in  Chicago 
before a U.S. Department of Agriculture report today that may
show smaller global stockpiles.  Russia , the world’s third-
biggest wheat exporter last season, cut grain exports by 20
percent this year and is expected to import 2 million tons to 3
million tons in the first half of 2013.  The price of wheat for March delivery, the most active
contract, fell 0.9 percent to 8.4150 in early trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  “The American price is not very competitive and exports of
wheat are poor,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp,
South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone. “Our wheat is
down today as we are following the international market
prices.”  South  Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer after  Ethiopia .  White corn for delivery in March fell 0.9 percent to 2,413
rand a ton, while the yellow variety for July delivery, dropped
1.1 percent to 2,226 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
