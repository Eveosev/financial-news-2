Clifford Chance  LLP, the U.K.’s
highest grossing law firm, has formed an alliance with new
 Singapore  firm Cavenagh Law LLP to expand its practice in the
Southeast Asian city into litigation.  London-based Clifford Chance was one of six foreign firms
awarded a license in 2008 to practice corporate law in Singapore
and the alliance adds to the U.K. firm’s arbitration and
regulatory practices in the city, the two firms said in a joint
statement today.  Singapore has been liberalizing its legal market and 23
foreign law firms applied for licenses to offer corporate law
advice in August. The number of foreign lawyers in the city has
almost doubled to 1,200 at the end of 2011 from 633 in 2007.  “The recent steps in the liberalization process taken by
the Singapore government further strengthen Singapore’s position
as a pre-eminent global legal hub,” Cavenagh’s Managing Partner
Harpreet Singh said in the statement.  Cavenagh was founded this year as a disputes boutique with
three partners, one counsel and five associates. Its three
partners are also partners at Clifford Chance.  Clifford Chance has  35 offices  in 25 countries with about
3,400 lawyers. Clifford Chance won approval to open an office in
Seoul,  South Korea  earlier this year and last year it opened
offices in Sydney and Perth, West Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
