OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest

is a confirmation of our shareholders’ trust in the company’s
stability and healthy development strategy,” Laszlo Diosi, the
chief executive officer of the unit, said in the statement.
“The decision is also proof that the bank is strengthening its
position on the local market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
