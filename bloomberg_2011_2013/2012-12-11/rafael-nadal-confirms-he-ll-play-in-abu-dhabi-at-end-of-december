Rafael Nadal, an 11-time Grand Slam
tennis champion, confirmed he’ll return to play in Abu Dhabi at
the end of the month after being sidelined by a knee injury
since June.  “Can’t wait to get back on the court in Abu Dhabi at the
end of the month,” Nadal wrote on his Twitter account. “I won
the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in 2010 and 2011 -- would
love to get my hands on the trophy again this year.”  The Spaniard started practicing in November in his home
town of Manacor on the island of  Mallorca . The 26-year-old
committed to playing in Abu Dhabi in Dec. 27-29. It’s a warm-up
for the Australian Open, which starts Jan. 14 in  Melbourne .  After winning a men’s record seventh French Open, Nadal was
upset in the second round of Wimbledon by then 100th-ranked
Czech Lukas Rosol in June. His earliest exit in one of the four
majors turned out to be his last match of the season.  Nadal said in September that he had a partial tear of a
patella tendon as well as knee inflammation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
