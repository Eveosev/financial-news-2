Developers installed 684 megawatts
of solar panels in the U.S. in the third quarter, 44 percent
more than a year earlier, as residential projects rose to a
record, according to the  Solar Energy Industries Association .  About 3.2 gigawatts of solar energy will be installed in
the U.S. this year, the Washington-based trade group forecast
today in a statement.  Installations in the current quarter may almost double from
the third quarter to 1,200 megawatts, which would be the most
ever in a three-month period. Fourth-quarter installations have
accounted for more than 40 percent of the annual totals in the
past two years, driven in part by developers racing to qualify
for expiring incentives, according to SEIA.  “While Q3 2012 was remarkable for the U.S. PV market, it
is just the opening act for what we expect to see in Q4,”
Shayle Kann, vice president of research at GTM Research, said in
the statement. The Boston-based consulting company collaborated
with SEIA on the quarterly solar report.  Fourth-quarter installation last year made up 42 percent of
2011’s almost 1,900 megawatts, according to SEIA. Developers
were seeking to qualify for a U.S. Treasury program that expired
at the end of the year and paid cash grants equal to as much as
30 percent of projects’ costs.  Residential systems increased 12 percent in the third
quarter from the prior quarter to 119 megawatts as falling panel
prices and the growing popularity of solar-leasing programs made
it easier and less costly for homeowners to install rooftop
solar panels, according to the statement.  Non-residential solar projects, comprising commercial and
government systems, jumped 24 percent from the second quarter to
258 megawatts, driven by strong demand in California and
 Massachusetts .  SEIA expects installations to rise 25 percent to almost 4
gigawatts next year and to reach 5.4 gigawatts in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
