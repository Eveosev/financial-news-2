Wide receiver  Braylon Edwards  is
rejoining the  New York  Jets a week after criticizing officials
of the National Football League team.  The Jets (6-7), whose wide receiver corps has been thinned
by injuries, said on their website yesterday that they were
awarded Edwards off waivers from the Seattle Seahawks.  Edwards, 29, had 11 touchdown receptions while making 88
catches for 1,445 yards in the 2009-2010 seasons with the Jets.
He has been limited to a total of 23 catches and one touchdown
in 2011 with the San Francisco 49ers and this season with the
Seahawks.  Edwards, who spent his first four seasons with the
Cleveland Browns, defended Jets quarterback  Mark Sanchez  in a
Twitter post a week ago, saying “Don’t blame Sanchez. I played
there. Blame the idiots calling shots.”  Edwards later apologized for that comment.  “I have disrespected and insulted an administration that I
have the utmost respect for,” he said.  Sanchez, who called Edwards’s return after the Twitter
comments “a funny sequence of events,” told reporters last
night that he was glad to be reunited with the receiver.  “We have a good chemistry together,” Sanchez said. “I’m
confident throwing him the ball. I don’t think that will change.
Get him in the building soon and get him working.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
