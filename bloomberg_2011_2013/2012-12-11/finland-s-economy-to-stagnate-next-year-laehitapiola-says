Finland ’s economy will stagnate next
year as the debt crisis in the  euro zone  hurts exports from the
region’s northernmost nation, LaehiTapiola said.  Economic expansion won’t resume until the third quarter of
2013, resulting in zero growth for the year as a whole, the
Espoo, Finland-based bank and insurer said in a report released
today. That compares with a June forecast for 0.5 percent
growth. The economy may shrink more than 0.5 percent this year,
LaehiTapiola said on Sept. 27.  In 2014, Finland’s gross domestic product will grow 1.5
percent, the company said. Unemployment will reach 8.5 percent
next year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
