Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , the second-largest
credit-rating company, boosted its dividend by 25 percent as
companies taking advantage of record-low interest rates by
issuing bonds increase demand for its grades.  The company will pay 20 cents a share March 11 to holders
as of Feb. 20, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. The shares have increased 46 percent this year to
$49.16 today, compared with the 13.5 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Companies worldwide are selling almost unprecedented
amounts of debt as the Federal Reserve anticipates it will keep
its interest-rate benchmark near zero through at least mid-2015
and after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged
to do whatever’s necessary to protect the euro amid the region’s
fiscal crisis.  Corporate bond  sales  of $3.84 trillion globally are
approaching the $3.89 trillion record from 2009 with three weeks
remaining in 2012. Dollar-denominated corporate bond issuance of
$1.43 trillion this year is up from $1.13 trillion in 2011 and
surpassed the previous record of $1.24 trillion in 2009,
Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
