Service industries , such as banking
and accounting, will drive growth in the Cypriot economy rather
than construction and manufacturing, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers Cyprus.  The service sector may add 9,700 new jobs and generate 13
million euros ($16.9 million) a year in extra tax and social
security revenue over the next five years, said the accountancy
firm in a report entitled “Driving Jobs and Growth in Cyprus.”  The Central Bank of Cyprus said Dec. 7 the country’s
economy will contract by 2.4 percent in 2012 and shrink by 3.5
percent in 2013. That compared with estimates made in June for a
contraction of 1.1 percent this year and growth of 0.4 percent
next year. The bank blamed recession and austerity measures
implemented in exchange for an international bailout.  Tourism employed 17,900 people in Cyprus at the end of
2011, falling an average 1.7 percent a year in the period 2007
to 2011. That compared with 13,800 workers for international
services, an average annual rise of 3.9 percent over the same
period, according to the report.  Cyprus should seek to attract more companies to the island
by implementing measures including tax breaks for venture
capital firms and small and medium-sized enterprises, PwC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
