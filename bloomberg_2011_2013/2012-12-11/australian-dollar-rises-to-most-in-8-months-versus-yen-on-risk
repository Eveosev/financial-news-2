The Australian dollar rose to the
strongest in more than eight months versus the yen as German ZEW
investor confidence climbed, spurring demand for riskier assets.  New Zealand’s dollar gained to the strongest in nine months
versus the U.S. currency as 48 of 49 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News expect the  Federal Reserve  to announce tomorrow
it will expand its balance sheet. The gains in the Aussie were
limited after a report yesterday showed the nation’s business
confidence  plunged  to the lowest level since 2009.  “The ZEW report was a bit of a relief to the market for a
short-term risk bid,” said  Samarjit Shankar , a managing
director for the foreign-exchange group in  Boston  at Bank of  New
York  Mellon. “Investors for today are willing to give risk the
benefit of the doubt.”  Australia ’s dollar gained 0.4 percent to $1.0529 in New
York yesterday, touching strongest since Sept. 17. It rallied as
much as 0.7 percent to 86.94 yen, the highest since March 28,
before trading at 86.89 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar advanced to 0.5 percent to 83.93 U.S.
cents, reaching the strongest since March 2. The kiwi rallied as
much as 0.8 percent to 69.28 yen, the strongest since May 4.  Futures traders pushed  net bets  the Australian dollar will
rise against the greenback to a record 92,229 contracts in the
week ended Dec. 4.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of German investor and analyst expectations
climbed to 6.9 this month from minus 15.7 in November.
Economists forecast a gain to minus 11.5, according to a
 Bloomberg News  survey.  In Australia, the  confidence index  dropped to minus 9 from
minus 1 in October, according to a National Australia Bank Ltd.
survey. The  business conditions  gauge, a measure of hiring,
sales and profits, held at minus 5, the weakest level since May
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
