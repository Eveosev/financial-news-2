The  Portuguese government  is ready
to implement additional measures in 2013 if there are slippages
in meeting budget targets, the European Commission said.  Fiscal consolidation efforts are “in line” with the
budget-deficit targets of 5 percent and 4.5 percent of gross
domestic product for 2012 and 2013, respectively, the commission
said in a report obtained by  Bloomberg News  about the sixth
review of the aid program it conducted together with the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Central Bank. The
program is “broadly on track,” it said.  “In view of the risks associated with the strongly
revenue-based adjustment, the authorities are preparing
contingency measures, predominantly on the expenditure side,
amounting to 0.5 percent of GDP,” the Brussels-based commission
said about the 2013  budget . “Going forward, the mission
supported the authorities’ intention to re-balance the
adjustment effort toward permanent reductions in expenditure.”  A “large” share of these contingency measures consists of
additional reductions in the wage bill and increased efficiency
in the functioning of public administration, according to the
46-page report.  Portugal  is also “optimizing” cash reserves, said the
commission, the European Union’s executive arm. “As a
consequence, the likelihood of Portugal being able to cover its
financing needs in 2013 has strongly improved.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
