Hilton Worldwide Inc. and  Marriott
International Inc. (MAR)  are heading a drive to invest as much as $1.8
billion over the next four years in Peru to handle surging
tourist demand, an industry group said.  Other hotel chains including  Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H) ,  Accor SA (AC) 
of France, Portugal’s Grupo Pestana SGPS SA and Colombia’s GHL
Grupo de Hoteles and Hoteles Estelar Colombia SA are studying
projects in Lima and cities such as Cuzco, Arequipa and
Trujillo, said Jose Koechlin, president of Peru’s Hotel
Association.  “Any new hotel capacity is immediately absorbed by growing
demand, like the  Lima Westin (HOT)  last year,” Koechlin said today in
an interview in Lima. “This is in line with President Ollanta Humala’s goal of making tourism Peru’s second-biggest revenue
earner.”  An estimated 2.8 million tourists visited attractions such
as the Machu Picchu Inca citadel and Colca Canyon this year, a
12 percent increase from 2011, according to the Andean country’s
Ministry of Foreign Trade & Tourism. Peru’s $3.5 billion tourism
industry is the country’s fourth-largest revenue earner after
minerals, crude oil and agricultural produce.  Marriott is looking to invest $104 million in hotels in
Cuzco, Trujillo and Lima, while Hilton plans to invest $65
million in Cuzco and Lima, according to figures from the Hotel
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
