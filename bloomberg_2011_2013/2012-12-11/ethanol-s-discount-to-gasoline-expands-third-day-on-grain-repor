Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened for a third day after a government report that increased
the outlook for wheat supplies raised concern that demand for
corn as a livestock feed would decline.  Ethanol dropped after the Agriculture Department raised its
estimate of global wheat production and U.S. inventories. About
42 percent of the corn crop will be consumed by ethanol,
according to the agency. Ethanol in the U.S. is made using corn.  “The big thing was the wheat carryout being increased,”
said Garret Toay, founder of Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in
Clive,  Iowa .  The difference between ethanol and gasoline expanded to
27.15 cents a gallon from 24.81 cents yesterday, based on
futures settlement prices. The spread has averaged 61.69 cents
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 1.1 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.339 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Nov. 15. Futures have climbed 6.2 percent
this year.  Ethanol has fallen 2.9 percent this month on ample
supplies, Toay said.  Stockpiles of the fuel in the week ended Nov. 30, climbed
to 19.3 million barrels, the highest level since July 27, while
 production  gained 4 percent to 835,000 barrels a day, the
highest since June 29.  ‘You’re not seeing a drawdown that we’d like to see,” Toay
said. “It seems like it’s a one-for-one, give or take. Every
time we increase production we see a build in stocks.”  Spot Prices  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  tumbled 7.5
cents, or 3 percent, to $2.45 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive decreased 7.5 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.35, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 6.5 cents, or 2.6 percent,
to $2.415 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel lost 4
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.475.  Gasoline for January delivery rose 1.24 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $2.6105 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Corn for March delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$7.28 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
