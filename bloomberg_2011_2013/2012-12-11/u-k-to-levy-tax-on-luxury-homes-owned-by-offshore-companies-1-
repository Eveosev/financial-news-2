The U.K. government will introduce
on annual tax on residential real estate valued at more than 2
million pounds ($3.2 million) that’s owned by an offshore
company.  The charge will begin in April, the U.K. Treasury said in a
draft of the bill today. Owners of homes valued at more than 20
million pounds may have to pay a levy of as much as 140,000
pounds a year, according to the Conservative-led government’s
annual budget report in March.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  targeted the wealthy to pare a
record budget deficit by lifting a transaction tax, known as
stamp duty, to 7 percent from 5 percent on homes sold for more
than 2 million pounds. The government is also introducing
capital-gains tax on home sales by non-naturalized owners valued
at more than 2 million pounds.  “It is designed to deter high-value residential properties
being ‘enveloped’ within a company so as to prevent an
opportunity for stamp duty land tax avoidance on future sales,”
Sean Randall, real estate tax director at Deloitte LLP, said by
e-mail.  Farmhouses valued at more than 2 million pounds and
occupied by working farmers will qualify for relief from the new
tax, according to the draft legislation. Homes owned by a
charity and held for charitable purposes can also gain an
exemption.  “Farmers would have been unfairly penalized because there
are a number of business benefits to being incorporated,”
Knight Frank LLP said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
