OAO Mechel (MTL) ’s 24 percent decline this
year is prompting Veles Capital to recommend buying  Russia ’s
biggest producer of steelmaking coal on prospects recovering
demand and a stronger ruble will boost earnings.  American depositary receipts of Moscow-based  Mechel (MTLR) , which
pared a drop of as much as 1.4 percent to close little changed
at $6.43 in New York yesterday, have slid the most in 2012 of
the  14 Russian stocks  included in the  Bloomberg Russia-US (RUS14BN)  Equity
Index. Futures expiring Dec. 17 on Russia’s RTS Index added 0.3
percent to 149,180 in New York as crude, the nation’s biggest
export earner, rose for the first time in six days.  Mechel shares have been sinking as the company restructures
some of the $8.8 billion of debt it owed at the end of the first
half that made it the most indebted Russian mining company after
aluminum producer  United Co. Rusal. (486)  Mechel will report today
that third-quarter net income almost quadrupled to $94.2 million
from $25.7 million a year ago, according to the median of six
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The ruble’s 4.7 percent advance
versus the dollar this year reduces the cost of debt repayments
for the company, Aton Capital says.  “The market extremely undervalues the stock and
overestimates risks associated with Mechel,” Ivan Manaenko,
head of research at brokerage Veles Capital, said by phone from
Moscow yesterday. “There is potential for growth there. We
expect an increase of demand for steelmaking coal from China and
more demand for thermal coal in Russia and Europe because of a
cold winter.”  Premium Narrows  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 0.8 percent to $29.06
yesterday, the highest level since Oct. 22. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in the stock futures,
slipped 4.2 percent to 22.8 points. The Bloomberg Russia-US
gauge, which tracks the most-traded Russian companies in the
U.S., climbed 0.6 percent to 97.  Mechel rallied 2.8 percent to 197.4 rubles, or the
equivalent of $6.43, in Moscow yesterday in the steepest one-day
advance since Oct. 5. The surge narrowed the ADR’s  premium  over
the shares traded on Russia’s Micex Index to 0.03 percent, from
2.9 percent on Dec. 10. The 30-stock Micex was little changed
yesterday at 1,448.43, after gaining as much as 0.4 percent.  The company, which reported an $823 million loss in the
second quarter amid falling coal prices, got banks to agree to
an amendment and restatement agreement over its $1 billion
syndicated loan, according to a Dec. 5 statement. The loan,
which matures in 2015, would have required $600 million be paid
back next year in monthly installments. The repayments will be
delayed for 12 months, Mechel said.  ‘Many Problems’  “Those who think Mechel will get through its many
problems, they buy at the current price levels,” Aleksei Belkin, who manages about $400 million in equities as chief
investment officer at Kapital Asset Management LLC, which owns
Mechel stock, said by phone from Moscow yesterday.  The ruble was little changed at 30.716 per dollar
yesterday, after strengthening 0.6 percent on Dec. 10. Futures
expiring in December on Russia’s currency indicated
strengthening for a fourth day yesterday, rising 0.1 percent to
30.73 per dollar.  “The stronger the ruble, the smaller Mechel’s debts are,”
Ilya Makarov, an analyst at Aton Capital in Moscow which rates
Mechel sell, said by phone from Moscow yesterday. “The foreign
exchange rate makes a dramatic difference for Mechel, because of
the company’s huge debt.”  Cold Boost  Signs  China ’s economy is recovering from its seven-quarter
slowdown bolsters the outlook for coal prices and Mechel,
according to Veles’ Manaenko.  Chinese industrial output and retail sales rose more than
economists predicted in November, data released Dec. 10 showed.
The world’s second-largest economy may grow 8 percent in 2013,
the official People’s Daily reported yesterday, citing Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at the State Information Center. The
government set a 7.5 percent expansion target for 2012, the
lowest goal since 2004.  Eastern Europe has been hit by a wave of cold Siberian air
and above-normal snowfall, triggering a surge in demand for
natural gas and electricity across the region. Temperatures
dipped below minus 20 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit) throughout
the region and at least 17 people have been killed.  The freeze “will boost demand for thermal coal,” Manaenko
said. “Prices for steelmaking coal tend to rise when thermal
coal prices rise, so Mechel will benefit from this cold
weather.”  Norilsk Stakes  ADRs of  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) , the world’s largest
producer of the metal, rose 0.6 percent to $17.75 yesterday in
New York, the highest level since May 1. Trading volume was more
than twice the average daily volume over the past three months,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Norilsk’s  shares  in Moscow fell
2 percent to 5,266 rubles yesterday, or $171.47. One ADR
represents a 10th of an ordinary share.  Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich may increase his
Norilsk stake by 4.1 percent to 7.5 percent or as much as 10
percent, the RIA Novosti newswire reported yesterday, citing an
unidentified person with knowledge of the discussions. John
Mann, Abramovich’s spokesman, declined to comment when called
yesterday.  Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum producer, owns 25.1
percent of Moscow-based Norilsk, and billionaire Vladimir Potanin’s Interros Group has a 28 percent stake. Abramovich’s
Millhouse LLC will own 5.87 percent of Norilsk after the company
retires a 17 percent stake in treasury stock, Rusal and Interros
said yesterday in a joint statement.  Crude Gains  The S&P GSCI Index tracking prices of 24 commodities gained
0.1 percent to 631.93 yesterday, rising for the first time in
six days.  Crude for January delivery rose 0.3 percent to $85.79 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent for
January settlement on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange added 0.6 percent to $108.01 a barrel.  Urals crude ,
Russia’s chief export oil blend, climbed 1.1 percent to $106.63
yesterday.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
rose 0.4 percent to HK$4.84 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:18
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
