The cost of  iron ore  shipped to
 China  exceeded the average price of locally-mined supplies for
the first time in five months, ending a price arbitrage that
helped push November imports to the second-biggest on record.  The  price  of ore with an iron content of 62 percent landed
in Tianjin port rose for a sixth day, advancing 1.2 percent to
$124.90 per dry metric ton, the highest since July 20, according
to The Steel Index.  The average price of ore of a similar quality mined in
China averaged $121.60 per ton on Dec. 10, the last day data was
provided, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg from Antaike
Information Development prices. On Monday imported prices rose
above the cost of the locally produced steel-making ingredient
for the first time since July 11, the data show.  “There is no workable arbitrage,” RS Platou Markets AS,
an Oslo-based investment bank, said in an e-mailed report today.
“ Brazil  exports have been particularly quiet in the last few
weeks.”  Fewer shipments from Brazil, the second-largest exporter
after  Australia , are affecting average hire costs for Capesize
vessels used to transport the commodity, according to Platou.  Capesizes, the largest ships that carry iron ore and coal,
fell 11 percent to $10,023 daily, the most since Aug. 15,
according to the  Baltic Exchange , a London-based assessor of
freight costs. Rates are 37 percent lower this month, data show.
The Baltic Dry Index, a wider measure of shipping costs, slid 4
percent to 900 today, the most since Jan. 26.  China’s November iron-ore  imports  climbed 17 percent from
the previous month to 65.8 million tons, the highest since
January 2011, data show. China is estimated to import 65 percent
of the world’s 1.11 billion tons of ore shipped by sea,
according to Clarkson Plc, the largest shipbroker.  Average hire costs for Panamax ships, the largest to
transit the Panama Canal, fell 1.6 percent to $7,263 daily,
while Supramaxes, about 25 percent smaller, were little changed
at $7,853 daily. Handysizes, the smallest tracked, climbed 0.1
percent to $6,588 daily, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
