The pound held a four-day gain
versus the euro after a  Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors
gauge of  house prices  in the U.K. declined last month, remaining
around a level indicating “broadly flat” values.  Sterling was little changed against the dollar. The RICS
said the index dropped to minus 9 from minus 7 in October,
citing a monthly poll of property surveyors. A result below zero
means more of them saw values drop than increase last month. The
median forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for an
improvement to minus 5. Gilts were little changed before the
U.K. plans to sell as much as 3.25 billion pounds ($5.23
billion) of  government bonds  maturing in 2022.  The pound was at 80.49 pence per euro at 8:24 a.m. London
time from 80.50 yesterday and fetched $1.6084 after rising to
$1.6131 on Dec. 4, the strongest since Nov. 2.  Sterling has gained 1.4 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 2.5 percent and
the dollar fell 2.3 percent.  The yield on 10-year gilts was 1.77 percent, with the price
of the 1.75 percent security at 99.83. Two year yields were also
little changed,at 0.27 percent.  Gilts returned 2.8 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
4.2 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
