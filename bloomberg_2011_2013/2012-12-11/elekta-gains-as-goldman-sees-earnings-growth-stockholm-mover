Elekta AB (EKTAB)  advanced the most in one
week in  Stockholm  trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
forecast that the Swedish company will increase sales and
earnings by taking market share from its biggest rivals.  Elekta, a manufacturer of radiation-surgery equipment,
 gained  as much as 2.1 kronor, or 2.1 percent, to 104.4 kronor,
its steepest climb since Dec. 4, and was up 2 percent at 104.3
kronor as of 12:16 p.m. local time. The volume was 38 percent of
the three-month daily average.  Goldman Sachs today raised its 12-month share price target
on Elekta to 133 kronor, from 122 kronor previously, and
reiterated its earlier Conviction List Buy recommendation on the
stock. The Swedish company, which is based in Stockholm and has
3,300 employees, competes with Varian Medical Systems Inc. and
Germany’s  Siemens AG. (SIE)   “Elekta remains the best positioned company on our
industrial scorecard,” Veronika Dubajova and Mick Readey,
analysts at Goldman Sachs in London, wrote in a note to clients
today. “We expect growing demand for radiation therapy in
 emerging markets  coupled with market share gains from Siemens
and Varian to drive top-quartile revenue and earnings growth,
and top-quartile returns.  Elekta’s current valuation is ‘‘relatively undemanding,’’
the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
