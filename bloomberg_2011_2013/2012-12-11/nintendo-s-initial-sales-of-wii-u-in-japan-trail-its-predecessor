Sales of Nintendo Co.’s new Wii U
console in  Japan  trailed those of the original Wii in the first
two days, a market researcher said, as the world’s biggest
 video-game maker  tries to bounce back from its worst loss.  The sales of 308,570 lagged behind the 371,936 initial two-
day sales of the Wii in 2006, market researcher Enterbrain Inc.
said today. The top-selling game for the Kyoto-based company was
“New Super Mario Brothers U” at an estimated 170,563 units, it
said.  Nintendo debuted the console in the U.S. on Nov. 18 -- with
consumers there buying 400,000 units in the first week -- as
pressure mounts on Chief Executive Officer Satoru Iwata to
repeat the success of the Wii. Facing increased competition from
smartphones, tablets and free games like “Angry Birds,”
 Nintendo cut  its profit goal 70 percent in October after posting
its first annual loss in  three decades  last year.  “It’s hard to give a final judgment unless we see sales
for two or three weeks,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The Wii U got sold out because of a
shortage in supply.”  Nintendo fell  4.8 percent to 8,800 yen in Osaka trading,
extending the declines this year to 17 percent. The company
isn’t the source of information for Enterbrain’s forecast,
Nintendo spokesman  Yasuhiro Minagawa  said.  “We believe it was a strong start,” Minagawa said in a
phone interview from Kyoto. “Just as the Wii sold out at many
outlets on its debut, the Wii U is also out of stock at the
retailers.”  Monster Hunter  Capcom Co. (9697)  sold an estimated 110,149 units of “Monster
Hunter 3 (Tri) G,” making it the second-most popular game,
Enterbrain said in the statement.  Nintendo’s  first home console  since 2006 came in two
versions at 26,250 yen ($319) and 31,500 yen with a 6.2-inch (16
centimeters) touch-screen controller called the GamePad.  U.S. consumers spent 11 percent less on video games,
consoles and accessories in November than a year earlier, led by
fewer purchases of consoles and handheld players. Retail
spending on the products totaled $2.55 billion last month, down
from $2.87 billion a year earlier, according to industry
researcher NPD Group Inc.  Nintendo plans to sell 5.5 million Wii U consoles and 17.5
million 3DS players this fiscal year, it said in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
