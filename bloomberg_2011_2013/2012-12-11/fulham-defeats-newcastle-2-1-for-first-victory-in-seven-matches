Fulham defeated Newcastle 2-1 at
home last night to pick up its first victory in seven matches in
English soccer’s Premier League.  Steve Sidwell’s deflected shot got past Newcastle keeper
Tim Krul in the 19th minute, giving the home team its first goal
in more than five hours of play. Hatem  Ben Arfa  tied the match
nine minutes into the second half, but Hugo Rodallega’s header
gave Fulham the win.  The victory pushes Fulham into 13th place, three points
ahead of Newcastle, which has lost five of the last six matches.
Fulham hadn’t won in the league since a 1-0 match against Aston
Villa Oct. 20.  “It was a vital win,” Fulham manager Martin Jol said in a
broadcast interview. “If you lose this game you get in a
depression and we didn’t want that. It wasn’t easy, although if
you look at the chances we had we should have finished it off a
lot earlier.”  Newcastle hasn’t won a league game away from home yet this
season. It defeated Wigan 3-0 a week ago.  “The performances against Stoke, Wigan and today have
improved, but it is a worry we don’t have enough points,”
Newcastle coach Alan Pardew said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
