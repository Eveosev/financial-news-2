A former  MF Global Inc. (MFGLQ)  broker
pleaded guilty to federal commodities act violations after the
U.S. accused him of making unauthorized trades that caused the
now-defunct futures company to lose more than $141 million.  Evan Brent Dooley, 44, who worked in MF Global’s Memphis,
Tennessee, office, entered his plea today before U.S. District
Judge Robert M. Dow in Chicago. A federal grand jury indicted
Dooley in 2010 over trades he made in 2008.  MF Global Holdings Ltd., the brokerage’s parent, filed for
bankruptcy in October 2011 after making a $6.3 billion wrong-way
trade on its own behalf of the bonds of some of  Europe ’s most
indebted nations.  Dooley, of  Olive Branch ,  Mississippi , pleaded guilty to two
counts of violating Commodities Exchange Act speculative-
position limits. Each count carries a maximum five-year
sentence. He also faces a potential $1 million fine, acting U.S.
Attorney  Gary Shapiro  said in a statement.  Dooley declined to comment after the hearing today.  He was charged with 16 counts of  wire fraud , each
punishable by as long as 20 years in prison. He had pleaded not
guilty in May 2010 before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nan Nolan, and
was released on a $4,500 bond.  Remaining Counts  Dow set a March 8 sentencing date and allowed Dooley to
remain free on bond. After sentencing, the U.S. will ask Dow to
dismiss the remaining counts in the indictment, according to the
plea agreement.  Dooley also agreed to pay restitution to the collapsed
firm, totaling $141,024,294, according to the agreement.  Dooley was associated with New York-based MF Global from
September 2006 to February 2008 and was permitted to trade on
his own account and for clients, prosecutors said when
announcing his indictment in April 2010.  Patrick Fitzgerald, the  Chicago  U.S. attorney when the
charges were announced, said Dooley “allegedly induced MF
Global to open a trading account and act as his financial
guarantor by providing false information about his financial
condition on his account application.” The case was brought in
Chicago because the transactions were conducted through CME
Group Inc.’s Chicago Board of Trade.  Lacking Funds  In an overnight session in January 2008, Dooley allegedly
executed a series of large buy and sell orders for about 1,500
wheat futures contracts, according to the indictment. Each
contract comprises 5,000 bushels, according to the indictment.  While lacking the funds to cover potential losses, he
liquidated his position that night for a gross profit of about
$37,000, prosecutors said. Confronted by an MF Global supervisor
the next day, Dooley allegedly said the activity was
inadvertent, according to the indictment.  A month later, with a negative $3,000 balance in his
account, Dooley allegedly executed buy and sell orders for
almost 32,000 contracts, including more than 24,000 for May 2008
wheat futures and, in the course of trading that night, exceeded
positional limits set by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. He was unable to successfully liquidate his
position.  “On or about Feb. 27, 2008, MF Global authorities learned
of defendant’s overnight trading, deactivated defendant’s
account and then liquidated the remainder of defendant’s
position,” according to the indictment. “A loss of
$141,021,489 was realized. Defendant was financially unable to
cover the losses created by his trading.”  The lost money was equivalent to 6 percent of MF Global’s
equity at the time, Chief Executive Officer Kevin R. Davis said
in a Feb. 28, 2008, teleconference.  The case is U.S. v.  Dooley, 1:10-cr-00335, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
