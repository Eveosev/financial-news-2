Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) , the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, said global primary insurance premiums in
non-life as well as in life and health are set to increase next
year as global economies grow.  Life insurance premiums will rise 2 percent in 2013 after
not growing this year, while property and casualty premiums will
climb 3 percent in real terms, fueled by  emerging markets , the
Zurich-based reinsurer said in a  statement  today.  “Economic activity is expected to be moderately stronger
next year, and insurance pricing is projected to improve,”
Swiss Re said. The reinsurer  presented  its 2013 insurance
outlook in  London  today.  Non-life reinsurance premiums grew 3.4 percent this year
and will advance 4.9 percent in 2013, according to Swiss Re.
Life and health reinsurance premiums will shrink by about 0.7
percent next year, following a 1.6 percent decline this year.
Swiss Re didn’t provide total premium figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
