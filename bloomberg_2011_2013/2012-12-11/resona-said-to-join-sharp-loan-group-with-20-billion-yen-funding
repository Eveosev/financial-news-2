Resona Holdings Inc. (8308)  will join
Japanese lenders offering 360 billion yen ($4.4 billion) of
emergency loans to TV maker  Sharp Corp. (6753) , three bank officials
with knowledge of the matter said.  Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp., Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co. and Resona’s banking unit are holding talks on a
plan under which Resona would provide 20 billion yen and the two
trust banks would each offer 10 billion yen to loans announced
in September, the officials said, asking not to be named because
the discussion is confidential.  Sharp, the manufacturer cutting more than 10,000  jobs  as it
tries to return to profit, secured 180 billion yen in
collateralized loans through its main lenders Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., it said on
Sept. 28. Osaka-based Sharp also got a 180 billion yen credit
facility that expires at the end of June.  Japan ’s Yomiuri newspaper reported the three banks’
contribution to the emergency loan yesterday, without citing
anyone.  Shinya Matsumoto, a spokesman for  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , which houses the trust banking unit, declined to
comment. Michio Nagano, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Mizuho
Trust, and Kunio Matsui, a spokesman for Resona, also declined
to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
