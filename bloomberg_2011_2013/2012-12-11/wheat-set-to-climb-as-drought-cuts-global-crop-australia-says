Wheat prices may climb 20 percent in
the year through June as drought threatens crops from the U.S.
to  Russia , boosting global supply concerns, said last year’s
second-biggest exporter.  The free-on-board Gulf price of U.S. hard-red winter wheat,
the so-called world indicator price, may average $360 a metric
ton in the year to June 30 from $299 a ton a year earlier, the
Canberra-based  Australian Bureau  of Agricultural and Resource
Economics and Sciences, or Abares, said today. World trade may
drop 9.7 percent to 131 million tons on reduced supply, it said.  Prices in Chicago have climbed 30 percent this year, making
the world’s most used food-grain the best performer among the 24
commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.
That may boost global food  costs . Russia, last year’s third-
biggest wheat exporter is bracing for its coldest winter in 20
years after farmers planted crops into parched soil. The crop in
the U.S., the top shipper, is in the worst condition in at least
27 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Nov. 26.  “Price movements in the second half of 2012-13 are
expected to be closely linked to the harvest outcomes of major
exporting countries in the southern hemisphere, such as
 Australia  and  Argentina , and seasonal conditions for plantings
of the 2013-14 wheat crop in the northern hemisphere,” the
 bureau  said. Prices may average significantly higher if dry
conditions persist in major producers such as the U.S., it said.  Four-Year High  Wheat for March delivery was little changed at $8.4825 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 10:41 a.m. in  Singapore .
Futures reached at four-year high of $9.4725 in July.  Australia cut its harvest and export estimates last week
after dry weather. Output is set to reach 22 million tons, 2.2
percent below a September estimate and compared with a record
29.9 million tons a year earlier, Abares said Dec. 4. Exports
may be 20.9 million tons in the year that started Oct. 1, from
an all-time high of 24.7 million tons a year earlier, it said.  World food prices, while down 11 percent from a record in
February 2011, were the highest ever on average during the past
two years and more than doubled in the past decade, according to
the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization in  Rome .  The market may be “underestimating the problems” in wheat
supply,  Abdolreza Abbassian , an economist at the FAO, said on
Dec. 6. World wheat stockpiles will shrink this year to the
smallest since 2009, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter for this story:
