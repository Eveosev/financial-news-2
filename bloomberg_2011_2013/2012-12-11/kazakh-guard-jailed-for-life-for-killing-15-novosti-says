A Kazakh border guard was sentenced
to life in prison for killing 14 of his fellow servicemen and a
forest ranger at an outpost on the border with  China  in May,
Novosti-Kazakhstan  reported .  The ruling was announced today by a judge in the town of
Taldykorgan, the Kazakh news service reported from the court
room. The 19-year-old was the only survivor from the outpost and
initially confessed to the murders. Later he recanted, saying
the confession was made under pressure from investigators,
