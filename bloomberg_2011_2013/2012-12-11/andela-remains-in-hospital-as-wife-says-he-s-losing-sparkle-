Nelson Mandela  spent a fourth day in
a Pretoria hospital receiving medical treatment for a lung
infection, while his wife, Graca Machel, spoke about him losing
his “sparkle.”  The 94-year-old former president was admitted to the
hospital on Dec. 8 to undergo tests, which “revealed a
recurrence of a previous lung infection,”  South Africa ’s
Presidency said in an e-mailed statement today. Mandela “is
responding to the treatment,” it said.  After spending 27 years in prison for fighting against
white minority rule, Mandela helped negotiate a peaceful end to
apartheid, taking office after the first all-race elections in
1994. He stepped down as president voluntarily in 1999.  Machel said in an interview with Johannesburg-based eNews
Channel Africa that Mandela’s aging is painful to witness.  “The spirit and the sparkle, you see that somehow it’s
fading,” she told the broadcaster.  Mandela underwent exploratory surgery for an abdominal
complaint in February and was hospitalized a year before that
for an acute respiratory infection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
