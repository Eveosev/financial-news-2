Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  forecasts global
energy consumption will rise 35 percent by 2040, driven by China
and  India , the Wall Street Journal reported, citing the
company’s latest long-term energy outlook.  Exxon projects North America will become a net energy
exporter by 2025 because of an increase in oil and gas
production and improvements in energy efficiency, the newspaper
said. The Irving, Texas-based company is the world’s biggest
energy producer by market value.  The use of coal will decline 33 percent by 2025, compared
with a previous estimate of 23 percent, as more natural gas-
fired power stations are built, the report said. The growth of
U.S. and Canadian oil and gas production may lead to an increase
in international shipments, according to the report.  Exxon compiles the outlook annually to guide long-term
investment decisions.  Demand in developed regions such as the U.S.,  Canada  and
 Europe  will be unchanged or decline as they become more
efficient, according to the newspaper report. While developed
nations by 2040 are forecast to generate 80 percent more
economic output than in 2010, they will use the same amount of
energy, the newspaper said, citing the outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
