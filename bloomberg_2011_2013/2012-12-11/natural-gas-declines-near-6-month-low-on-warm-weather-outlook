Natural gas futures dropped for a
fourth day in  New York  on forecasts of milder-than-average
weather that may limit demand for the heating fuel.  Gas slipped as much as 1 percent after WSI Corp. in
Andover,  Massachusetts , predicted mostly above-normal
temperatures in the eastern half of the U.S. from Dec. 16
through Dec. 20. Prices closed at $3.46 per million Btu
yesterday, the lowest settlement since Oct. 26.  “December has been a dud so far in terms of heating
demand,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “I was under the
impression that we were going to see colder weather than we had
last year. The forecasts so far aren’t very supportive.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 1.8 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.442 per million British thermal units at 9:15
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures are up 15
percent this year.  The low in New York on Dec. 17 may be 36 degrees Fahrenheit
(2 Celsius), 4 more than the usual reading, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  The low in
 Chicago  on may be 29 degrees Fahrenheit, 7 above normal. About
50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating, Energy
Department data show.  Warmest Year  This year will probably overtake 1998 to become the warmest
year on record in the U.S., the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration  said in a monthly climate report.  The first 11 months were the warmest start to any year in
the contiguous states since the nation began keeping records in
1895, NOAA’s  Climatic Data Center  said Dec. 6.  U.S. natural gas  output  in the lower-48 states rose to a
record in September as new wells in the Northeast’s Marcellus
shale formation started producing, the Energy Department said.  Production increased 0.6 percent to 73.05 billion cubic
feet a day, the highest level in data going back to 2005, the
department’s Energy Information Administration said in the
monthly EIA-914 report, released Nov. 30 in  Washington .  The report covers gas gross withdrawals, which include gas
used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared, and non-
hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing operations.  U.S. gas inventories fell 73 billion cubic feet last week
to 3.804 trillion, erasing a year-over-year surplus for the
first time in 2012, according to the Energy Department.  Supplies were 0.9 percent below year-earlier levels and 4.6
percent above the  five-year average  in the week ended Nov. 30.
The surplus to the average has declined from a six-year high of
61 percent in March, department data show.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first eight months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
