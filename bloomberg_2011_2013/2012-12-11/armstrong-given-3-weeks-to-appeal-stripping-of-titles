Lance Armstrong  has been given three
weeks to appeal a decision by cycling’s governing body to strip
him of all the titles he’s won in the past 14 years.  The 41-year-old has been officially informed that his
results dating back to Aug. 1, 1998 have been nullified, the
Lausanne, Switzerland-based UCI said today. Backdated to Dec. 6,
the American has three weeks to appeal.  In August, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, or USADA, stripped
Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles and banned him for
life for using prohibited substances after he opted not to
contest doping charges in arbitration. USADA’s stand was upheld
in October by the International Cycling Union, known by the
French acronym UCI.  The UCI decision came after USADA released a 202-page
summary of its findings on Oct. 10, which stated Armstrong
“engaged in serial cheating” throughout his career. Armstrong
has denied using performance-enhancing drugs.  International Olympic Committee President  Jacques Rogge 
told reporters Dec. 5 that the IOC wouldn’t take any action on
the bronze medal Armstrong won in the individual time trial at
the 2000 Sydney Olympics until he’d been notified by the UCI and
given the right to appeal.  “It is only after that period that the IOC can legally
take action,” Rogge said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
