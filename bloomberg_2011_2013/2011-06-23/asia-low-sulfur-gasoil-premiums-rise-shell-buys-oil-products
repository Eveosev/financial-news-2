Premiums for low-sulfur gasoil in
 Asia  increased after Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a cargo in
 Singapore . Naphtha refining margins fell, while fuel oil’s
viscosity spread was at the narrowest since January.  Middle Distillates  Shell bought 150,000 barrels of gasoil, or diesel, with 10
parts-per-million of sulfur from PetroChina Co. at $2.50 a
barrel over benchmark quotes, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of traders and brokers monitoring transactions on the
Platts window. That’s the largest premium since Shell paid plus
$2.60 on May 18. PetroChina has sold six similar cargoes so far
this month.  BP Plc bought two cargoes of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil
totaling 220,000 barrels from Singapore Petroleum Co., the
survey showed. The transactions were at discounts of 35 cents
and 55 cents to quotes for the first 10 days of July.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude fell $1.26
to $17.70 a barrel at 5:30 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure
of refining profit, was at the narrowest since May 30.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 5 cents to 95 cents a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade is down 17 percent so far this
week, signaling it’s becoming less profitable to produce
 aviation fuel .  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for second-half August delivery
to  Japan  traded at $933 a metric ton on the Platts window, the
survey showed. Shell sold a cargo to Cargill Inc.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to London-traded
 Brent crude , or the crack spread, fell to $95.19 a ton from
$99.48 at the end of Asian trading yesterday, Bloomberg
calculations showed.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline for loading from Singapore traded
at $117.90 a barrel, according to the survey. Vitol Group bought
two 50,000-barrel cargoes for loading July 13 to July 17 from BP
and Total SA.  Vitol also purchased from Total another three 92-RON
cargoes for the same loading period at premiums of 70 cents to
80 cents to benchmark prices published by Platts.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 88 cents to
$6.56 a barrel, according to PVM data. Yesterday, the gap was
the smallest since Sept. 8, indicating reduced losses from
making residual products.  July high-sulfur fuel oil swaps rose $12.25, or 1.9 percent,
to $653.50 a ton, the highest since June 15, PVM said. The
premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade was
unchanged after falling to $9.50 yesterday. This viscosity
spread was at the narrowest since Jan. 27, indicating bunker, or
marine fuel, has declined less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
