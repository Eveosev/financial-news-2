Uganda  may start inflation targeting
within a year, central bank Deputy Governor Louis Kasekende
said.  The East African nation also plans to introduce a monthly
central  bank rate , Kasekende said in the capital, Kampala,
today. The bankâ€™s move to inflation targeting, which it has
started testing, has been prompted by the difficulty in using
Treasury bills and bonds to control  money supply , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
