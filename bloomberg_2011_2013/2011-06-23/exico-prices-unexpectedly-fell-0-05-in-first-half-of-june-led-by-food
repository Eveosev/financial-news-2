Mexico ’s consumer prices
unexpectedly declined in the first half of June, dragged down by
food and beverage costs in  Latin America ’s second-biggest
economy.  Prices fell 0.05 percent in the first two weeks of the
month, the central bank said in a report posted on its website
today. Economists forecast a 0.11 percent rise, according to the
median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Controlled prices are allowing the central bank to keep
borrowing costs at a record low as the recovery of the domestic
economy lags the export sector, according to Sergio Martin, an
economist at the Mexico unit of HSBC Holdings Plc.  “There are no inflationary pressures that could make the
central bank raise rates,” Martin said in a telephone interview
from Mexico City. The report “was much more positive than what
you could have expected.”  Core prices, which exclude energy and food costs, rose 0.04
percent. Food and beverage prices fell 0.40 percent.  The peso weakened 0.8 percent to 11.8901 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:00 a.m. New York time.  Mexico’s policy makers, led by Central bank Governor
Agustin Carstens, extended the bank’s longest-ever interest rate
pause on May 27, voting unanimously to keep the benchmark
lending rate in Latin America’s second-largest economy at 4.5
percent for a 19th straight meeting.  Peso Rally  Among the major Latin American countries that target
inflation, only Mexico has yet to raise rates in the past year.
Policy makers said inflation should remain within the target
range of 3 percent to 4 percent this year, according to the
minutes of the meeting published June 10.  Mexico’s exchange rate is helping to keep a lid on prices,
according to the economist Martin. The peso is up 10 percent
since the end of 2009, the biggest advance among Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the Colombian peso. A
stronger currency brings down prices by making imports cheaper.  Mexico’s unemployment rate rose 5.2 percent in May, the
national statistics agency said today in a separate report.
Economists expected a jobless rate of 4.9 percent, according to
the median of 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s central bank will next increase the nation’s
benchmark lending rate in March 2012, according to the median
estimate of 21 economists in a survey e-mailed June 20 by
Banamex, Citigroup Inc.’s local unit.  Mexican retail sales rose 4.9 percent in April from last
year, the country’s statistics agency said yesterday on its
website.  Industrial production rose 1.4 percent in April from a year
earlier, the institute said in a June 13 report.  Consumer prices will rise 3.67 percent in 2011, according
to the central bank’s monthly survey of economists, down from a
forecast of 3.87 percent last month. The economy will expand
4.37 percent in 2011, according to the survey published June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
