The zloty slid to its weakest versus
the euro in 2 1/2 months after rising U.S. jobless claims and
concern about the European financial crisis drove investors from
risk while the Polish markets were closed for a state holiday.  The zloty depreciated 0.9 percent as of 3:39 p.m. in
 London , weakest intraday level since April 5.  The euro weakened 1.8 percent to the dollar after European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said risk signals for
financial stability in the euro area are flashing “red” and
the  Federal Reserve  cut estimates for U.S. growth. Equities
worldwide extended losses after the U.S. Labor Department said
applications for jobless benefits jumped 9,000 in the week ended
June 18 to 429,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
