Remember how after Chemical Bank launched the first Automated Teller Machine in the 1960s, waves of bank branches shut down? And remember when banks went online, how waves of local bank branches shut down? Oh wait.  In both cases the new technology ended up augmenting, rather than replacing existing channels. This isn't unusual. Despite bold proclamations of industry transformation, legacy technologies often last for a very long time. For example, commercial telephony services emerged in the 1870s. Western Union, the day's leading telegraphy player, declined to invest in the new technology. Eventually telephone ended up being the cornerstone of AT&T*. But telegraphs were still viable commercial offerings as late as the 1960s. The last telegraph message was sent in...2005. Not every transition takes this long. DVDs replaced video cassettes in many markets seemingly overnight. Sometimes a new solution comes along that is just better than the old solution along so many dimensions that a true one-for-one switch can occur (although I wonder if DVDs would have really accelerated as quickly as they did without the concurrent emergence of digital video recovers that addressed the fact that most DVD players could play, but not record). But generally old technologies last longer than most people expect.  Why is this? New technologies tend to suffer some performance limitations, making them unattractive to customers who are sensitive to those limitations. And, of course, ingrained habits are just hard to break for all sorts of reasons. So, what then to make of recent pronouncements that  hot payment startup Square is on track to kill credit cards, cash registers, and other traditional payment mechanisms ? Square is certainly a startup to watch. Co-founder Jack Dorsey was one of the founders of Twitter. Rumors suggest its next funding round  will value the company at more than $1 billion  — only two years after formation.  What's Square all about ? The company provides a small device that allows iPhones and iPads to read credit cards. It recently announced a simple iPhone app that consumers can download to complete transactions, manage their rewards programs, and so on. Right now Square relies on a credit card to complete the transaction, but future offerings could remove the credit card companies from the transaction entirely.  Others are eyeing the same multi-trillion-dollar transactions space. Just the other week Google announced its Google Wallet solution, which, when combined with Near Field Communication technology, aims to make it convenient for people to complete transactions with their mobile phones. These developments certainly have transformational potential. But don't expect that transformation to happen overnight. It is likely to start relatively slowly in established markets. Just imagine a merchant that did drop its cash register. What would they do with customers who didn't have smartphones? Or didn't trust the new payment mechanism? Would they really turn away their business?  Transformation usually happens most quickly when its roots lie outside of mainstream markets. For example, millions of Kenyan consumers use  Safaricon's M-PESA service  to securely transfer money. The wide diaspora of Filipino consumers uses mobile solutions to remit money to relatives in their home market. Kenya and the Philippines lack the ubiquitous credit infrastructures and access to cash that exist in more developed markets. The new transaction mechanisms compete with not-very-good workarounds. Similarly, PayPal grew by facilitating transactions that never happened before — person-to-person payments on auction powerhouse (and PayPal owner) eBay. On the other hand, Square has to compete against super simple and widely accepted behaviors — like, for instance, cash. I'm always skeptical when a technology's success is predicated on a full replacement of an existing, effective solution. That transition typically takes longer than people anticipate. Watch instead for providers that find ways to drive transformation away from the mainstream. * That second "T" of course originally stood for telegraphy.
