A “consensus” bet that gold will
rise is one of the largest risks facing  hedge funds  because
investors may suffer losses across their holdings if the bet
sours, said Kenneth Heinz, president of Hedge Fund Research Inc.  “One of the biggest risks that I observe comes from the
very big consensus trades that everyone thinks are good ones,”
Heinz said today at the GAIM hedge-fund conference in Monaco.
“The long gold position” is a risk “that investors should be
aware of,” he said.  Gold climbed to a record last month and is heading for its
11th year of gains, the longest winning streak since at least
the 1920s. Concerns that rising inflation, Europe’s sovereign
debt crisis and low  interest rates  have attracted hedge-fund
managers such as  John Paulson  to invest in the metal.  Marc Faber , publisher of the Gloom, Boom & Doom report,
said in an interview today that he plans to continue buying gold
even though it’s likely to decline over the next three months.  George Soros  is among some investors who have curtailed
their bullish wagers on gold. The billionaire sold 99 percent of
his bullion-backed SPDR Gold trust assets and all 5 million
shares in the iShares Gold Trust in the first quarter, according
to a May filing with U.S. regulators.  Gold for August delivery fell $13.90, or 0.9 percent, to
$1,539 an ounce on the Comex in New York as of 8 a.m. today
after the U.S. Federal Reserve dampened speculation it would
expand measures to stimulate the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
