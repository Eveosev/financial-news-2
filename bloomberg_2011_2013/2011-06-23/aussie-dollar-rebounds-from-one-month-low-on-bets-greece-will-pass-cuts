The Australian dollar climbed from a
one-month low against the U.S. currency on optimism  Greece  will
pass budget cuts next week needed to receive additional aid,
boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie advanced against all of its 16 major
counterparts after European Union leaders yesterday urged Greece
to implement the cuts and vowed to do what’s needed to meet the
country’s financing needs. New Zealand’s dollar headed for a
weekly gain against the yen as Asian stocks rallied.  “People are just waiting for some of these uncertainties
to clear up, and the global economy isn’t looking too bad,”
said  Adam Carr , a senior economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in
Sydney. If the Greek vote on budget cuts “looks like it’s going
to be passed or has been passed, definitely I will be buying the
Aussie and kiwi.”  Australia ’s dollar was at $1.0537 at 3:56 p.m. in Sydney
from $1.0523 in  New York  yesterday, when it touched $1.0455, the
lowest since May 25. It was down from $1.0623 on June 17. The
Aussie traded at 84.83 yen from 84.72 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar fetched 81.32 U.S. cents from 81.39
cents. The kiwi was at 65.47 yen from 65.53. It has gained 0.6
percent this week against the yen. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
of regional shares rose 1.1 percent.  Budget Cuts  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said he received the
support of the country’s EU partners during the first day of a
summit meeting. His nation’s next hurdle is to get 78 billion
euros ($111 billion) of austerity measures approved by
parliament, after the program’s endorsement by experts from the
European Commission,  European Central Bank  and International
Monetary Fund.  “You won’t know until next week how things will develop in
Greece,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, a senior currency analyst in
Tokyo at Ueda Harlow Ltd., which provides foreign-exchange
margin-trading services. “Australia has already raised  interest
rates  a lot, and there may not be room left for a lot more hikes.
The Aussie is likely to be top-heavy.”  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia kept its key interest rate
unchanged at 4.75 percent on June 7 and said current policy
settings are appropriate.  Demand for the Aussie and New Zealand dollars was limited
after the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials slid 2.3
percent yesterday, falling for a second day.  The yield on Australia’s 10-year government note fell two
basis points to 5.08 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates, rose to 3.38 percent today from
3.33 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
