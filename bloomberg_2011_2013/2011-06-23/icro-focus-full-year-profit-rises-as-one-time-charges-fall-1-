Micro Focus International Plc (MCRO) , a
U.K. software provider that’s the subject of a possible
takeover, said profit rose 30 percent last year after one-time
charges declined.  Net income for the year ended April 30 increased to $97
million, or 46.2 cents a share, from $74.4 million, or 36.7
cents, a year earlier, the Newbury, England-based company said
in a statement today. Revenue rose 0.8 percent to $436.1
million.  “This has been a disappointing year for Micro Focus,”
Chairman Kevin Loosemore said in the statement. “The reported
results are significantly below management’s expectations at the
beginning of the year.”  The company’s “failure to execute in line with agreed
plans has resulted in two profit warnings and a further change
in executive management,” Loosemore added.  Nigel Clifford quit as chief executive officer in April
after less than a year in charge. Last month  Micro Focus  said it
received approaches from U.S. private equity firms Bain Capital
and Advent International.  “The recent bid speculation has demonstrated that others
see value in our business, particularly around our strong cash
generation,” Loosemore said. “The management team is committed
to improving our performance and delivering value to all
stakeholders whether as an independent company or through a
change of ownership.”  The shares fell 9 pence, or 2.5 percent, to 345 pence at
8:03 a.m. in London trading, the lowest since April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
