Commodities dropped the most in
seven weeks after the  International Energy Agency  announced
plans to release emergency oil supplies and U.S. jobless claims
rose more than economists forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities fell as
much as 4.7 percent, the most since May 5, and was down 3.7
percent at 648.65 by 5:40 p.m. in London. Brent crude oil in
London led the decline, falling 5.5 percent.  The IEA will make available 60 million barrels of crude to
alleviate possible shortages following the loss of Libyan oil.
The U.S. will release 30 million barrels from its Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, as part of the IEA effort. U.S. jobless
claims increased to 429,000 last week, exceeding the highest
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 47 economists.  “The market’s perception is that there’s not enough
demand,” said Christoph Eibl, co-founder of Zug, Switzerland-
based Tiberius Group, which manages about $3 billion in
commodities. “People are being caught off guard.”  Brent oil for August delivery dropped $6.21 to $108 a
barrel on ICE Futures  Europe . Crude oil for August delivery
slumped 4.4 percent to $91.22 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  “The IEA’s perception is that there’s not enough supply,”
Eibl said.  Silver for September delivery declined 4.7 percent to
$35.04 an ounce on the Comex in  New York  and raw sugar for
October delivery slumped 1.9 percent to 25.5 cents a pound on
ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Copper for three-month delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
$8,966.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  Corn for December delivery tumbled 3.6 percent to $6.2675 a
bushel and wheat declined 3.5 percent to $6.4975 a bushel.  Gold for August delivery fell 2.2 percent to $1,519.90 an
ounce, the first drop in eight sessions, and palladium for
immediate delivery declined 2.5 percent to $745.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
