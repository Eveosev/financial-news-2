Italy’s Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  said the current economic and financial crisis in
Greece is a source of “political risk” for  Europe .  “The Greek uncertainty is not only a source of financial
risk, but also of political risk,” he said at an event in Rome,
according to the text of a speech published on the Finance
Ministry’s website. He added that in several European countries
there is a chance of “a crisis of democracy and, as a
reflection, of a crisis of the European political
architecture.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
