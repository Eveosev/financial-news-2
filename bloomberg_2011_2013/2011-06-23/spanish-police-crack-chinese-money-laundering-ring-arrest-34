Spanish police arrested 34 Chinese
citizens who formed part of a money-laundering ring that was
processing 40 million euros ($57 million) a year,  Spain ’s 
Interior Ministry  said in a  statement  on its website.  Law authorities seized 11 million euros worth of goods from
the group, which has been operating in Spain since the 1990’s,
according to the statement.  The ring imported fake goods from  China  including tobacco,
textile products and accessories via a port in Valencia which
were then distributed in Spain, France, Italy, the U.K. and
Portugal for a “significant” amount of money, according to the
statement.  The money was then sent back to China and laundered via a
network of 30 companies, among which was a network of 1,000
launderettes, owned by a Chinese holding company, the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
