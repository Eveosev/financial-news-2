South Korean consumer confidence
declined in June from a three-month high in May and inflation
expectations held near the  Bank of Korea ’s 4 percent target
ceiling.  The sentiment index fell to 102 from 104 in May, the Bank
of  Korea  said in an e-mailed statement from Seoul today. A
reading above 100 indicates optimists outnumber pessimists. The
expected inflation rate over the next year was 3.9 percent,
unchanged from last month, today’s report showed.  A sub-index measuring consumers’ views of the economic
outlook dropped to 86 from 91 in the previous month.  The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 2,018 households in 56 cities. It was conducted by mail and
telephone between June 13 and June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
