Michael de Jong-Douglas, deputy
chief executive officer of  Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) ’s
management company, said he’s resigning from the  Singapore  real
estate investment trust controlled by Temasek Holdings Pte.  De Jong-Douglas will take a three-month leave before
“getting back into the thick of things as of October 1,” he
said in an e-mail received by Bloomberg News.  He couldn’t be reached in his office for a comment. Richard Lai, chief executive officer of the trust’s management company,
couldn’t be reached at his office and on his mobile phone.  De Jong-Douglas joined the property trust in May 2009,
according to Mapletree Logistics’s annual report. He was
formerly a managing director of ProLogis, where he worked for 11
years in various roles at the world’s largest warehouse owner.  Mapletree Logistics, which owns warehouses and industrial
properties in seven markets including China and  Japan , is 41
percent-owned by Temasek, Singapore’s state-owned investment
company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mapletree Logistics’s shares climbed 8.9 percent in the
past year, compared with a 6 percent gain in the Singapore
benchmark Straits Times Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
