Second seed Novak Djokovic beat
Kevin Anderson of  South Africa  to reach the third round of the
Wimbledon tennis tournament.  The Serb won 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. The 24-year-old could become
No. 1 in the ATP tennis rankings should he win the grass court
event or currently top-ranked  Rafael Nadal  doesn’t retain the
Wimbledon title. Djokovic has reached the semifinals in south
London twice.  “The wind was very strong,” Djokovic said in televised
courtside interview. “In important moments, I played well, I
served well and I returned very very well.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
