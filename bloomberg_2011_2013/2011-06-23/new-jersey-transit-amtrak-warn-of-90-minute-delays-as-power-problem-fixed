New Jersey Transit  warned some
commuters of delays of as much as 60 minutes after Amtrak fixed
a power problem that idled trains for both railroads, snarling
the evening  New York  City commute.  Trains are running slower and late on the Northeast
Corridor, North Jersey Coast Line and Midtown Direct lines, New
Jersey Transit said in an e-mailed message at 5:53 p.m. local
time. Delays were as long as 90 minutes earlier.  Amtrak warned of significant delays north and south of New
York and resumed operations between New York and Philadelphia as
well as on its Northeast Corridor. The railroad is still
investigating the cause of the problem that led to trains being
held at stations for about an hour and a half, according to a
separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
