Smith & Nephew Plc (SN/) ,   Europe ’s
largest maker of shoulder and knee implants, said it was awarded
$85 million after a federal jury found  Arthrex Inc.  infringed
the company’s patent on surgical anchors.  The jury in  Portland , Oregon, found that Arthrex’s Bio-
SutureTak, Peek SutureTak, PushLock and Bio-PushLock violated
the patent rights, London-based Smith & Nephew said in a
statement today. Closely held Arthrex pledged to appeal.  The devices are anchored to a bone to repair tears in the
rotator cuff or in the labrum, a fibrous ring in the shoulder
socket. The trial is the third time the case, which began in
2004, has gone before a jury. The first ended in a mistrial. The
second resulted in a $14.7 million award against Naples,
Florida-based Arthrex that was overturned by an appeals court
because the judge erred in interpreting key terms of the patent.  “We remain confident our SutureTak and PushLock anchors do
not infringe the patent in issue,” John W. Schmieding, general
counsel for Arthrex, said in an e-mailed statement.  The victory comes in the same week a U.S. appeals court in
a separate case ruled that Arthrex didn’t infringe a Smith &
Nephew patent over a device to fix grafts to a bone. The grafts
are used to replace the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee.  The  Oregon  case is Smith & Nephew Inc. v. Arthrex Inc.,
04cv29, U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon
(Portland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
