South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, increased its forecast for this
season’s harvest of the grain after rains helped crop growth.  The government’s  Crop Estimates Committee  expects farmers
to reap 11 million metric tons of the grain this season, up from
a previous estimate of 10.99 million tons, according to
spokeswoman Marda Scheepers.  The committee’s white corn forecast was reduced to 6.369
million tons and the yellow corn estimate increased to 4.629
million tons, she said by phone from  Pretoria  today.  The Crop Estimates Committee was expected to leave its
forecast unchanged, according to the median estimate of 13
traders surveyed by Bloomberg News. Forecasts ranged from 10.74
million tons to 11 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
