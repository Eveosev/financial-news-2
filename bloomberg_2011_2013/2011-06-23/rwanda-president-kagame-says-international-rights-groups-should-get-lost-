Rwandan President  Paul Kagame 
rejected reports this month by  Human Rights Watch  and  Amnesty
International  that accused the government of denying basic
freedoms, saying the organizations should “get lost.”  “I don’t give a damn what they say or what they do,”
Kagame told reporters in the East African capital, Kigali,
today.  The New York-based Human Rights Watch report criticized
 Rwanda ’s community gacaca courts, which have heard more than a
million cases in the years since at least 800,000 people were
killed in the 1994 genocide. The courts denied some suspects a
fair trial, it said. Amnesty accused the government of using
out-dated laws against genocide denial and sectarianism to
stifle free speech and punish journalists, human rights workers
and the opposition.  The East African nation’s elections last year, where
Kagame won with 93 percent of vote, was “marked by a clampdown
on freedom of expression,” London-based Amnesty said.  “There is no freedom of expression?” Kagame said. “If
you don’t want to express yourself, it’s not my problem. I have
given you the tools. Express yourself.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
