Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared
wireless venture should face more tests of whether it interferes
with the U.S. global positioning system before getting
regulatory clearance, speakers at a congressional hearing said.  Lawmakers “may request” that the Federal Communications
Commission “allow time for full, comprehensive testing” of
LightSquared’s proposal announced June 20 to operate on
different airwaves than first planned, Representative Tom Petri,
a Wisconsin Republican, said today at a hearing of the House
aviation subcommittee.  LightSquared “must not interfere with aviation safety”
that depends on GPS, said Petri, who chairs the panel.  LightSquared, backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital
Partners hedge fund, plans to invest $15 billion to serve
mobile-Web users over a network of 40,000 base stations, using
airwaves previously reserved mainly for satellite services
including GPS.  Makers and users of GPS devices say LightSquared may
overwhelm their faint signals. Those expressing concern have
included  General Motors Co. (GM) , which said its OnStar navigation
service was affected during trials.  The House Appropriations Committee today added language to
a spending bill to bar regulators from clearing LightSquared for
commercial operations until interference concerns are resolved.
The amendment was adopted on a voice vote, said a news release
distributed by e-mail from the office of Representative Steve  Austria , an Ohio Republican who introduced the measure.  Impact on Aviation  Revamping navigation equipment on commercial aircraft to
accommodate LightSquared would cost billions of dollars, and
halt implementation of a new U.S. air-traffic control system
called NextGen that is to use GPS, said Tom Hendricks, a senior
vice president with the  Air Transport Association .  Congress should prohibit LightSquared from operating its
network in a way that interferes with GPS, said Hendricks, whose
Washington-based trade group lists members including  Delta Air
Lines Inc. (DAL) , the biggest U.S. passenger carrier, and  United
Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , which flies cargo.  The Federal Communications Commission, which granted
preliminary approval to LightSquared in January, has ordered the
Reston, Virginia-based company to deliver a report on
interference by July 1 before granting final clearance.  A U.S. advisory panel has concluded that LightSquared would
degrade global-positioning system navigation devices as far away
as outer space and recommended that regulators revoke the
tentative approval granted to the company.  LightSquared Changes Plan  To reduce interference, LightSquared will use different
airwaves than it had intended, Chief Executive Officer Sanjiv Ahuja said in an interview on June 20. The change would resolve
interference concerns for all but a limited number of users such
as farm-equipment makers, he said.  The proposed solution would resolve interference problems
for 99 percent of GPS users, and the company wants to discuss
how it can make use of more airwaves, said Jeff Carlisle, an
executive vice president of LightSquared.  “LightSquared has no intention of operating its system in
a way that will compromise government or commercial aviation or
maritime operations,” Carlisle said.  LightSquared’s original plan “is not compatible” with GPS
operation, said Roy Kienitz, undersecretary for policy at the
U.S. Transportation Department.  “That doesn’t mean the story is over,” Kienitz said.
LightSquared’s alternative “has promise” and “any plan needs
to be thoroughly tested before it goes forward,” he said.  ‘Catastrophic Effect’  LightSquared’s proposed operations would have a
“catastrophic” effect on GPS, and the government should
require the company to move to another set of airwaves, said
Philip Straub, a vice president with GPS-equipment maker Garmin
International Inc.  General Motors’ position hasn’t changed as a result of
LightSquared’s June 20 announcement, OnStar spokesman Vijay Iyer
said in an interview.  “We still want to keep testing it,” Iyer said. “If
there’s new things to test, we want to keep testing them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
