Peru ’s sol fell for a second day
amid concern Europe’s debt crisis and a slowing U.S. economy
will cut demand for the Andean country’s metal exports.  The sol dropped 0.2 percent to 2.7610 per U.S. dollar at
11:41 a.m. New York time, from 2.7550 yesterday.  Copper prices fell in New York after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said the euro area’s debt problems
risk spreading to its banks, and after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke said the U.S. isn’t recovering as fast as expected.
Gold also fell. Metals led by copper and gold accounted for two
thirds of Peru’s $35 billion export revenue last year.  “As long as the  U.S. economy  remains so weak, it will
affect global growth, which goes hand in hand with
commodities,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the head currency trader at
 Banco Santander  in Lima.  To contact the reporter on this story:
