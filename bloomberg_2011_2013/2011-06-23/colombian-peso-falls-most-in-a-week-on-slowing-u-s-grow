Colombia ’s peso fell the most in a
week after the  Federal Reserve  said growth in the world’s
biggest economy is slowing and European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the debt crisis in the euro area
threatens to infect banks.  The peso dropped 0.4 percent to 1,787.53 per dollar at 2:32
p.m. New York time, from 1,780.15 yesterday. It earlier declined
as much as 0.6 percent. The peso has gained 6.7 percent so far
this year, the best performer among the six most-traded Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The Labor Department said today U.S. jobless claims
increased 9,000 in the week ended June 18 to 429,000. The report
comes a day after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S.
economic recovery is progressing “more slowly” than expected.
The U.S. is Colombia’s biggest trading partner, buying about 40
percent of the South American nation’s exports.  “Everything is coming together to create an environment of
uncertainty in the market,” said Francisco Chavez, an analyst
at Bogota-based brokerage Corredores Asociados SA.  The peso eased earlier declines after a government report
today showed Colombia’s gross domestic product rose 5.1 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier. Analysts expected
growth of 4.8 percent, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  “At first look, it’s a good number, and the peso is
reacting positively to that,” said Daniel Lozano, an analyst at
Serfinco brokerage in Bogota.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.81 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The security’s price
rose 0.189 centavo to 117.539 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
