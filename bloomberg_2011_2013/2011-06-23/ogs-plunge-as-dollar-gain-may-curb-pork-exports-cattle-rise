Hog futures plunged the most in
three weeks as a rally in the dollar eroded prospects for U.S.
pork exports. Cattle prices rose.  The Dollar Index, which values the greenback against six
currencies, rose as much as 1.4 percent and headed for the
biggest rally since June 15. A rising dollar makes U.S. exports
more costly for importers. U.S. pork shipments were up 19
percent in the first four months of 2011 from a year earlier,
government data show.  “When you have large movements in the dollar like you did
today, it is going to impact these markets significantly,” said
 Dan Vaught , owner of Vaught Futures Insights in Altus,  Arkansas .
“Currency values influence the international prices.”  Hog futures for August settlement fell 1.025 cents, or 1.1
percent, to 96.3 cents a pound at 12:11 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. A close at that price would be the biggest
decline since June 2. Before today, the commodity rallied 15
percent in the past year as exports surged.  Pork stockpiles in the U.S. rose 22 percent to 545.1
million pounds on May 31 from a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said after markets closed yesterday.  Rising supplies of the meat “had a negative impact on the
market,” signaling higher prices are eroding demand, Vaught
said. Wholesale-pork prices jumped 15 percent in the past year,
reaching a record 98.31 cents a pound last month, USDA data
show.  The dollar rallied after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled yesterday that the central bank won’t add to
stimulus measures that could erode the value of the currency.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.275 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $1.11975 a pound in Chicago, after slipping as much
as 1.7 percent to a one-week low. Before today, the price
advanced 26 percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined 0.8
cent, or 0.6 percent, to $1.372 a pound in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
