Nissan Motor Co.,  Japan ’s second-
largest automaker, expects full-year profit to fall 15 percent
after the nation’s record earthquake disrupted production and
sales while the yen strengthened.  Net income may decline to 270 billion yen ($3.4 billion) in
the 12 months ending March 31 from 319.2 billion yen a year
earlier, the Yokohama-based company said in a statement today.
The projection is higher than the 237 billion yen average of
five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg in the past 28 days.  Japanese automakers are boosting production as they recover
from the March 11 natural disaster that damaged car factories
and parts plants, leading to a 60 percent plunge in domestic
vehicle output in April. Nissan expects to resume full
production globally by October.  “Nissan can’t expect much profit from Japan because of the
quake, or from  North America , because the major indicators like
GDP and the  unemployment rate  aren’t very positive,” said  Yuuki Sakurai , president at Fukoku Capital Management Inc. in Tokyo.
“Nissan should try to expand in  China ,  Russia  and other
emerging markets.”  Nissan’s global vehicle sales may rise 9.9 percent to 4.6
million this fiscal year, the company said. Revenue may increase
to 9.4 trillion yen from 8.77 trillion yen a year earlier.  China Sales  The automaker’s sales in China may rise 12 percent to 1.15
million vehicles, while North American sales may gain 6.8
percent to 1.33 million, Nissan said. Deliveries in Japan are
expected to grow 1.7 percent to 610,000, while those in  Europe 
may gain 10 percent to 670,000, the company said.  Nissan said it plans to double its shareholder dividend to
20 yen this fiscal year.  Carmakers are hiring temporary workers to help fill back
orders as output recovers. Toyota Motor Corp. plans to hire as
many as 4,000 people from mid-July as it prepares to ramp up
production in October. Nissan plans to hire 1,000 temporary
workers from August, in addition to 200 previously announced,
Corporate Vice President Joji Tagawa said.  Nissan aims to add extra days of operation in July to
recover lost output, the company said earlier this week.  Localizing Production  Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said yesterday that
plans to localize production of components such as engines and
transmissions in various markets are facing less resistance
within Nissan after the earthquake. Disruptions following the
March disaster affected output at overseas plants as well as
Japanese ones.  A Nissan engine factory in Fukushima prefecture was damaged
in the earthquake and was shut until April 17.  Nissan expects full-year operating profit to drop 14
percent to 460 billion yen. Higher selling expenses and
marketing may cut operating profit by 112 billion yen, while the
strengthened yen, which reduces the repatriated value of
Nissan’s overseas earnings, may trim operating profit by 135
billion yen, the company said.  The Japanese currency advanced 15 percent against the  U.S.
dollar  last year and reached a postwar record of 76.25 on March
17. Nissan is basing this year’s profit forecast on an exchange
rate of 80 yen to the dollar and 115 yen to the euro this fiscal
year.  Full-year profit at Toyota, Japan’s biggest carmaker, may
decline 31 percent to 280 billion yen in the year started April
1 as global vehicle sales decrease 0.9 percent to 7.24 million,
the Toyota City-based company said June 10.  Nissan rose 1.3 percent to 839 yen as of the 3 p.m. close
of trading in Tokyo, before the announcement. The shares have
gained 8.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
