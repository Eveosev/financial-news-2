Anglo Irish Bank Corp., the
recipient of a 29.3 billion-euro ($42 billion) bailout, had its
 credit rating  cut by  Standard & Poor’s  after Finance Minister
 Michael Noonan  said senior bondholders may face losses.  “We interpret this as a clear indication of reduced
appetite for further government support for the bank and its
senior unguaranteed debt holders,” the ratings company said in
a statement today.  S&P downgraded the Dublin-based lender one step to CCC,
four levels above default, according to the statement. The
rating could be lowered further because Noonan “will likely
continue to seek European approval to impose burden-sharing on
the bank’s bondholders,” S&P said.  Noonan and Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  have both said in the
past week that Ireland won’t act unilaterally to impose losses
on senior bondholders in Anglo Irish and rival Irish Nationwide
Building Society, which received a 5.4 billion-euro bailout last
year. The government will discuss the issue in the autumn with
the  European Central Bank , which doesn’t want senior bank
bondholders to face losses, Kenny said yesterday.  Anglo Irish has 3.2 billion euros of senior unguaranteed,
unsecured bonds and Irish Nationwide has 601 million euros of
such securities, the country’s central bank said April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
