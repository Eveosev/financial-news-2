Sierra Leone ’s central bank left its
monetary policy rate unchanged at 23 percent as it attempts to
curb inflation that accelerated to 15.4 percent in April.  The standing facility rate was increased to 30 percent from
28 percent, while the reverse repo rate was set at 25 percent
and the rediscount rate at 27 percent, the Freetown-based Bank
of Sierra Leone said in a  statement  published on its website
today.  “The underlying challenges remain containing the increase
in consumer price inflation recently driven by food and fuel
price increases,” the bank said in the statement. Uncertainty in
food and fuel prices, along with “recent improvements in the
fiscal position underscore the need to maintain a neutral
monetary policy stance.”  The economy of Sierra Leone is expected to expand by 5.5
percent of gross domestic product this year, faster than 2010,
said Finance Minister Samura Kamara in Freetown today. Domestic
revenue is projected to increase to 13.6 percent of GDP this
year from 13.3 percent in 2010, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
