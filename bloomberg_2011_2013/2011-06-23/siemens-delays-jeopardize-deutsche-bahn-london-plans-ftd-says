Siemens AG (SIE) ’s delays in delivering 16
new ICE trains to  Deutsche Bahn  AG jeopardize the railway’s
plans to offer a service to  London  by 2013, the  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing a report by the management board.  The delays will also make it impossible for Deutsche Bahn
to remedy a train shortage in its national fleet by next year,
the newspaper said in a preview of an article to appear in
tomorrow’s edition. Siemens claims the delays are caused by its
suppliers, according to FTD.  The trains were ordered in 2008 and were scheduled to be
delivered this year. Siemens may now not be able to provide them
until 2013 to 2015, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
