Gold futures plunged the most in
seven weeks as a slowing economy and a rising dollar eroded the
appeal of commodities as an investment and eased the risk of
accelerating inflation.  The  U.S. economy  is recovering at a “moderate pace, though
somewhat more slowly” than expected, Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday. The Dollar Index gained as much
as 1.4 percent, while a plunge in oil to the lowest price since
February led the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw
materials to drop as much as 4.7 percent today.  “People are getting out of commodities after we were told
yesterday that the economy is growing at a slower pace and is
underperforming expectations,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at
FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “Crude prices falling points
to a lower inflation rate, and you also cannot rule out that
some investors are selling gold to cover losses in other
markets.”  Gold futures for August delivery declined $32.90, or 2.1
percent, to $1,520.50 an ounce at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest loss since May 5. The metal reached $1,559.30
yesterday, the highest since touching a record $1,577.40 on May
2.  “There is flag pattern being formed here which points to
lower highs and higher lows,” said James Dailey, who manages
$185 million at TEAM Financial Asset Management LLC. said. “We
had a false breakout on the upper side yesterday, but prices
came down after that.”  Fed policy makers decided not to implement any new stimulus
measures after completing $600 billion of bond purchases this
month in a second round of quantitative easing, or so-called
QE2, intended to revive growth.  Buying Opportunity  Marc Faber , the publisher of the Gloom, Boom & Doom report,
still favors gold and silver. In an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “On the Move  Asia ,” Faber said he will keep
accumulating gold, even though prices of the metals may decline
in the next three months.  Gold has risen 7 percent this year, heading for an 11th
consecutive annual gain.  “Some people will look at today’s drop as a buying
opportunity,” Lesh said.  Silver futures for September delivery declined $1.738, or
4.7 percent, to $35.016 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest drop
since May 11.  Platinum futures for October delivery retreated $58.20, or
3.3 percent, to $1,697.50 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since Dec. 13.  Palladium futures for September delivery slumped $27.30, or
3.5 percent, to $743.35 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters for this story:
