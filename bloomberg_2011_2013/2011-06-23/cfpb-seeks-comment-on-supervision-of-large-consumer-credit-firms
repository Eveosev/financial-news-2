The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau is seeking comment on how it should supervise
non-bank firms such as large debt collectors, credit reporting
bureaus and prepaid card companies as part of new regulations
required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  “Consumers deserve the peace of mind that financial
companies -- both banks and non-banks -- are following the
rules,”  Elizabeth Warren , the Obama administration adviser
setting up the bureau, said today in a statement in Washington.  The bureau, which is scheduled to formally begin work next
month, is considering supervision of larger participants in six
consumer credit markets that may lead to on-site examinations
and registration requirements, according to the request for
comment. Dodd-Frank, the financial regulatory overhaul enacted
last year, requires the agency to propose regulations by July
21, 2012, on whether firms meet the definition.  Criteria for the designation could include the annual
number of transactions in a market, asset size or outstanding
loan balances, the bureau said. The public may comment on the
rule for 45 days once it has been published in the Federal
Register.  To contact the reporter on this story:
