Japanese bonds gained, pushing two-
year yields to the lowest this year, before U.S. reports that
economists said will show home sales dropped in May and
employers aren’t slowing job cuts.  Benchmark 10-year securities advanced for a second day as
Asian stocks declined after the  Federal Reserve  cut its forecast
for U.S. growth at a policy meeting yesterday and refrained from
announcing additional stimulus. Bonds rallied even as demand
declined at a 2.6 trillion yen ($32.3 billion) auction of two-
year notes.  “Bonds are being bought because the market is concerned
the  U.S. economy  will slow,” said Toru Suehiro, a market
analyst in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co., one of the 24 primary
dealers obliged to bid at the government’s debt sales.  The 10-year yield dropped 1.5 basis points to 1.105 percent
as of 1:56 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.2 percent security due
June 2021 gained 0.135 yen to 100.853. The yield matched the
levels set on May 16 and June 17, the lowest since November.  Two-year yields were unchanged at 0.15 percent after
dropping to 0.145 percent, also the least since November. Ten-
year bond futures for September delivery added 0.13 to 141.26 at
the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange  U.S. new home sales declined 4 percent to a 310,000 annual
rate last month, according to a Bloomberg News survey before the
Commerce Department report. Initial jobless claims were little
changed last week at 415,000, a separate survey showed.  Forecasts Cut  The Fed lowered its forecasts for growth and employment for
this year and 2012 at its two-day meeting. There was no mention
of additional versions of its bond-buying program, the second
round of quantitative easing, that ends this month.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares lost 0.7 percent and
the Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.1 percent.  The two-year sale drew bids for 3.94 times the amount on
offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 5.31
times at the previous auction last month. The lowest price was
100.085 yen, below the 100.090 level predicted by 12 traders in
a Bloomberg survey.  “Demand at today’s auction was a bit weaker as investors
were cautious,” Mizuho’s Suehiro said. “But buying pressure
for short-term debt has been increasing and demand will likely
continue to be resilient.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
