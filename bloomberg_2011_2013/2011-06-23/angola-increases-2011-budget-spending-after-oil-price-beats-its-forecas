Angola , sub-Saharan Africa’s second
biggest oil producer, increased its budget spending this year by
228 billion kwanza ($2.4 billion) after higher  oil prices 
boosted revenue, according to a finance ministry report
submitted to parliament.  The southern African nation’s expenditure will rise to 4.38
trillion kwanza, the document, handed to Bloomberg News today in
Luanda, the capital, show.  The extra money came from more revenue because of an
increase in crude oil prices to more than the $68 a barrel
estimate the government used for the 2011 budget, it said. The
state has increased its reference price to $95.35 a barrel.  Cabinda crude surged to $125.46 a barrel in April and was
at $112.59 today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Angola is producing an average 1.64 million barrels a day and
will probably pump 620.5 million barrel this year, the  finance
ministry  said.  The government will use 208 billion kwanza of the
additional spending to build roads and bridges and help pay for
an election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
