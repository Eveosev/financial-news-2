Portugal  led declines in the bonds
of the euro-region’s most indebted nations as European Union
leaders prepared to start a two-day meeting to seek ways to
avoid the euro area’s first sovereign default.  Losses pushed the yields on the Italian two-year note to
the highest in a month, while Irish and Portuguese 10-year
securities yielded the most relative to German bunds since the
euro’s introduction. Risk signals in the region are flashing
red, European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
late yesterday. German note yields fell to the least since
February as a report showed the region’s services and
manufacturing industries grew at a slower pace than predicted.  “There’s still a lot of concern about the periphery,
especially  Greece ,” said  Patrick Jacq , a senior fixed-income
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in Paris. “Key decisions have to
be made in the next 10 days or so and the market is relatively
nervous about that.”  Portuguese two-year note yields rose 71 basis points to a
euro-era record of 14.40 percent at 4:42 p.m. in London. The
yield on the equivalent-maturity Spanish security gained 17
basis points to 3.60 percent.  European leaders will reaffirm a time-line for assistance
to Greece hammered out by euro-area finance ministers, German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  told reporters in Brussels today. The
EU is awaiting a Greek parliamentary vote on austerity measures
before taking operative decisions, she said.  Euro Slumps  The two-year Greek yield, which climbed above 30 percent
for the first time last week, was 76 basis points higher at
28.64 percent. The 10-year yield was seven basis points higher
at 16.88 percent. It has jumped more than 4 percentage points
since the start of this year.  The euro slumped as much as 1.6 percent to $1.4127, the
biggest drop since June 15. Bonds from across the euro region
fell relative to bunds, with the French-German spread widening
three basis points to 45 basis points and the Dutch-German
spread reaching 35 basis points from 32.  The cost of insuring against default on European sovereign
debt rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps. The
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments jumped nine basis points to 233, approaching the
record 236 basis points set on June 16. An increase signals
deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  ‘Red’ Alert  Swaps on Greece were little changed at 1,984 basis points,
signaling about an 82 percent chance of default within five
years, according to CMA. Ireland increased 20 basis points to
775, Portugal climbed 25 to 807 and  Spain  rose 13 to 297.  German securities, perceived to be the region’s safest,
returned 0.4 percent this year, while Treasuries gained 3.3
percent, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek
government bonds have lost investors 18 percent this year amid
speculation that the country is moving closer to defaulting on
its debt commitments.  “On a personal basis I would say ‘yes, it is red’,”
Trichet said late yesterday in  Frankfurt  after a meeting of the
European Systemic Risk Board, referring to the group’s planned
“dashboard” to monitor risks. “The message of the board is
that” the link between debt problems and banks “is the most
serious threat to financial stability in the European Union.”  The spread between 10-year Italian bonds and German bunds
widened 14 basis points to 208, the most since Jan. 11.  European Industry  Moody’s Investors Service placed  Italy ’s Aa2 local and
foreign-currency government bonds under review for a possible
downgrade on June 17, partly citing “long-term structural
impediments to growth.” Portugal’s 10-year spread over bunds
climbed 39 basis points to a euro-era record 859 basis points.
Irish 10-year securities yielded 900 basis points more than
bunds, the most since the euro’s 1999 debut.  A composite index of services and manufacturing industries
based on a survey of euro-area purchasing managers fell to 53.6
from 55.8 in May, London-based Markit Economics said today.
Economists had forecast a drop to 55.2, the median of 16
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. A reading above 50
indicates growth.  Bunds have gained as investors sought a haven amid mounting
concern that officials will fail to contain the euro area’s
sovereign-debt crisis, making it more likely that the ECB will
pause rate increases as the recovery in the stronger economies
stalls. At a Brussels meeting today and tomorrow, EU leaders
will discuss the size of new loans to the Greek government and
how to get holders of their bonds to shoulder some of the cost.  The 10-year German bund yield fell eight basis points to
2.86 percent, the lowest since Jan. 11. The 3.25 percent
security due July 2021 gained 0.695, or 6.95 euros per 1,000-
euro face amount, to 103.315. Two-year note yields dropped 11
basis points to 1.37 percent, after reaching 1.35 percent, the
least since Feb. 22.  The German bund futures contract expiring in September rose
to 127 for the first time since Dec. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
