Peru ’s sol fell the most in more
than two weeks amid concern Europe’s debt crisis and a slowing
U.S. economy will cut demand for the Andean country’s metal
exports.  The sol dropped 0.2 percent to 2.7595 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, from 2.7551 yesterday.  Copper prices fell in New York after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said the euro area’s debt problems
risk spreading to its banks, and after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke
said the U.S. isn’t recovering as fast as expected. Gold also
fell. Metals led by copper and gold accounted for two thirds of
Peru’s $35 billion export revenue last year.  “As long as the  U.S. economy  remains so weak it will
affect global growth, which goes hand in hand with
commodities,” said Gonzalo Navarro, head currency trader at
 Banco Santander  in Lima.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 6.35
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
