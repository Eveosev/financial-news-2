The European Banking Authority has
updated its bank stress tests to take more account of potential
losses caused by banks’ holdings of sovereign debt from crisis-
hit European Union countries, Dow Jones reported.  The EBA has revised its guidelines on banks’ exposure to
sovereign risk to reflect recent market movements in the debt of
countries such as Greece and Ireland, the newswire said, citing
a spokeswoman.  The authority also set a minimum level for the risk weights
banks use to calculate provisions they need for potential losses
on sovereign debt, Dow Jones said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Kit Chellel in London
