The  World Bank  approved a 59.1
million euro ($84.3 million) loan for Montenegro, the Balkan
country said.  The 20-year loan, the details of which were negotiated in
June, comes at six-month Euribor plus 80 basis points and
includes a five-year grace period, Montenegro’s  Finance Ministry 
said in an e-mailed statement today following a meeting of World
Bank board of directors in  Washington .  The loan supports “Montenegro’s progress in implementing
reforms in its banking and financial services,” the ministry
said.  The World Bank’s resident representative Jan-Peter Olters
said in June the loan will support Montenegro’s budget, help
revitalize its banking industry and help strengthen the
supervisory role of the country’s  central bank  as it strives to
improve confidence in commercial lenders. Disbursement is
expected by early 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
