The U.S. government paid farmers
$10.5 billion in subsidies in 2010 as commodity prices boomed,
said a group that wants Congress to reduce crop-support payments.  Total subsidies dropped from $16.3 billion in 2009 as corn,
wheat, soybeans and cotton gained, said a report released today
by the Environmental Working Group.  About $6 billion of the payments were for crop-support
programs, $2.5 billion were for assistance to farmers who had
experienced weather disasters and $2 billion were for
conservation programs, according to the group.  The report is being released as lawmakers consider program
cuts to reduce the federal  budget deficit . Subsidies, which
encourage lower prices, benefit commodity buyers such as Archer
Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and ConAgra Foods Inc. An
attempt to end payments to farmers making more than $250,000 a
year in average annual income failed last week in the  House of
Representatives .  “The bulk of payments benefit a narrow group of commodity
mega-farms,” said Don Carr, a spokesman for the Washington-
based group, in a telephone interview.  The Environmental Working Group’s annual report is based on
government data compiled through public records and federal
Freedom of Information Act requests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
