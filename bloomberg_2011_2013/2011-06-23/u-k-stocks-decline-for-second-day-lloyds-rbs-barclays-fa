U.K. stocks fell to a three-month
low as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke failed to signal
further stimulus and European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said the region’s debt crisis is a threat to banks.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  declined more than 3 percent.  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  and BP Plc followed crude lower after the International
Energy Agency said it will release emergency oil stockpiles.
 Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  sank 6.9 percent, leading commodity
producers lower, after an analyst downgrade.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 98.61, or 1.7 percent, to
5,674.38 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the lowest since
March 16. The gauge has fallen 6.8 percent since Feb. 8 as
investors speculated that Greece will default on its debt and
central banks struggled with rising inflation and anemic
economic growth. The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  lost 1.7 percent today
and Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 0.9 percent.  “It’s the combination of euro-zone debt crisis continuing
and the economic news over the last two months, especially out
of the U.S., which has been dire,” said Ian Murrell, an analyst
at Pritchard Stockbrokers Ltd. in  London . “The way the economy
is going, it’s going to affect companies’ profitability sooner
or later.”  The Fed yesterday reiterated a pledge to keep interest
rates near zero and said it will complete a $600 billion bond-
purchase program as scheduled this month, even as Bernanke said
the recovery is progressing “more slowly” than expected. Fed
officials lowered their predictions for U.S. growth and
employment this year and next, forecasting that the economy will
expand 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent in 2011.  Flashing Red  Trichet said danger signals for financial stability in the
euro area are flashing “red” as the debt crisis threatens to
infect banks. He spoke late yesterday in  Frankfurt  after a
meeting of the European Systemic Risk Board.  Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, slid 3.7 percent
to 45.27 pence and RBS retreated 4.9 percent to 36.74 pence.
Barclays declined 3.6 percent to 243.35 pence.  Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, fell 2.2 percent to
2,112.5 pence. BP retreated 2.2 percent to 435.5 pence.  Oil fell as much as 6 percent to $89.69 a barrel in New
York after the IEA said it will release emergency stockpiles for
only the third time in more than three decades as the war in
Libya chokes global supplies.  Vedanta Downgrade  Vedanta slid 6.9 percent to 1,832 pence after BofA Merrill
Lynch Global Research cut the mining company to “underperform”
from “neutral.”  The brokerage reduced its estimate for 2012 earnings per
share by 30 percent, citing downgrades for Vedanta’s iron-ore
subsidiary. The analysts still set a price estimate for Vedanta
shares of 2,350 pence.  Other mining companies declined with metals prices.  Xstrata
Plc (XTA) , the biggest exporter of thermal coal, lost 3.6 percent to
1,243.5 pence for its first decline in five days.  Antofagasta
Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer controlled by Chile’s Luksic family,
dropped 3.4 percent to 1,237 pence.  Zinc, tin and copper declined on the London Metal Exchange.  Micro Focus International Plc (MCRO)  slid 7.8 percent to 326.5
pence. The U.K. software provider that may be taken over after
two profit warnings and the departure of two chief executives
within 12 months said revenue may drop this fiscal year.  Imagination Technologies Group Plc (IMG)  plummeted 16 percent to
349.6 pence, the biggest decline since May 2009. Morgan Stanley
downgraded the U.K. chip designer to “equal weight” from
“overweight,” while Canaccord Genuity cut its recommendation
to “sell.”  DS Smith Plc (SMDS) , a London-based paper company, rallied 15
percent to 245 pence, the largest gain since April 2009, after
reporting increased earnings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
