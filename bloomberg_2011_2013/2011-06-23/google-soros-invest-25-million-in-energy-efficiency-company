Transphorm Inc. closed a $25 million
round of financing from an investment fund managed by Soros Fund
Management LLC and existing investors such as  Google Inc. (GOOG)  to
fund its power waste reduction technology.  Quantum Strategic Partners Ltd. joined Kleiner Perkins
Caufield & Byers, Google Ventures, Foundation Capital and Lux
Capital in the Series D round of financing to bring the total
raised by the Goleta, California-based company to $63 million
since its founding in 2007, Transphorm said in a statement.  The company will use the funding announced today to speed
development of its technology to reduce electricity waste on
industrial equipment, Primit Parikh, president of Transphorm,
said in the statement.  Transphorm says its products reduce power waste by 90
percent and simplify the design and manufacturing of electrical
devices such as motor drives, power supplies and inverters for
solar panels and electric vehicles.  The company said that inefficient electric power conversion
results costs the  U.S. economy  $40 billion a year and is
equivalent to the output of 300 coal plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
