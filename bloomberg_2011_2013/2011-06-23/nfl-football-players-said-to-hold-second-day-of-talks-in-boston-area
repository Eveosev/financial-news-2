Contract talks between the  National
Football League  and its players continue today as the two sides
work to end a lockout that has shut down the U.S.’s most popular
sport, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.  Representatives of the NFL and  NFL Players Association  are
meeting for the second consecutive day in the Boston area,
according to the people, who were granted anonymity because they
weren’t authorized to discuss the talks.  The two sides have met in small sessions in recent weeks to
negotiate a labor contract. Owners of the $9 billion-a-year NFL
locked out players in March.  Greg Aiello , a spokesman for the NFL, declined to comment
on the status of talks in a text message. George Atallah, a
spokesman for the union, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment.  Owners met outside  Chicago  two days ago for a briefing on
the outline of a potential deal that would give players about 48
percent of a projected $9.3 billion in revenue next year,
according to a person familiar with the negotiations who was
granted anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the
situation publicly.  Training camps are scheduled to open in late July and the
season is set to begin in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
