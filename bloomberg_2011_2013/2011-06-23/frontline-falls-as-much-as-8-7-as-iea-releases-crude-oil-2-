Frontline Ltd., the world’s largest
operator of supertankers, declined as much as 8.4 percent after
the  International Energy Agency  said it will release emergency
oil stockpiles, potentially cutting demand for shipping.  Frontline fell as low as 84.65 Norwegian kroner in Oslo and
closed down 7.7 kroner, or 8.3 percent, at 85.3 kroner, giving
it a market value of 6.6 billion kroner ($1.2 billion). That was
the lowest close December 2003 and the one-day decline was the
largest in almost a month.  The U.S. and 27 allies will release emergency oil
stockpiles through the IEA for only the third time in more than
three decades as the war in  Libya  chokes global supplies. The
release of 60 million barrels, or 2 million barrels a day of oil
within the first 30 days, will be coordinated by the IEA, the
Paris-based agency said in a statement today.  “It’s all about the oil,” Debasish Sahabanik, an Oslo-
based analyst at Danske Market Equities, said by phone today.
The IEA’s release of reserves will likely lower consumer
countries’ need to import cargoes by sea, lowering demand for
tankers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
