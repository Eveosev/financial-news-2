Accenture Plc (ACN) , the world’s second-
largest technology-consulting company, raised its full-year
revenue and earnings forecasts on a surge of new bookings. The
shares rose in late trading.  Revenue will grow 14 percent to 15 percent this year,

the company said today in a statement. Earnings will be $3.36 to
$3.40, up from $3.22 to $3.30.  In the third quarter ended May 31, net revenue surged 21

the company’s biggest unit. Net income rose was $628
million from $490.6 million a year earlier. Profit was 93 cents
a share, up from 73 cents. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had
projected 90 cents.  “Our focus remains on driving sustainable and profitable
