Chemring, the developer of missile-
avoidance equipment for the Joint Strike Fighter, dropped the
most in almost four years in London trading after President
 Barack Obama  detailed plans to withdraw troops from  Afghanistan .  Chemring fell as much as 11 percent, to 570 pence, the
biggest intraday decline since August 2007. The stock traded 6.1
percent lower at 598 pence as of 11:35 a.m., valuing the company
at 1.16 billion pounds ($1.86 billion).  Obama announced last night that 33,000 troops will be
withdrawn from Afghanistan by September 2012. Chemring has a
record order book of 988 million pounds, of which 60 million
pounds to 70 million pounds relates directly to Afghanistan, the
company said today.  “Troop withdrawal is bad for sentiment,” wrote Ben Bourne, an analyst at Liberum Capital. He has a “buy”
recommendation on the shares of Fareham, England-based Chemring.  Chemring’s business in countries outside the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization increased to 25 percent of total revenue in
the first half ended April 30, from 16 percent a year earlier,
it said in a statement today. Underlying pretax profit climbed
17 percent to 49.6 million pounds, while sales rose 29 percent
to 329.8 million pounds.  “New products, training consumption and ongoing non-NATO
geographic expansion should sustain growth” for Chemring,
Bourne wrote.  The company said in March that it plans to start operating
a defense joint venture with Hinduja Group in  India  this year.
Chemring is also looking to form a joint venture in  Brazil  and
later in the  Middle East , Chief Executive Officer  David Price 
said in an interview today.  “The U.S. and outside of NATO is where we will be focusing
our investments,” Price said.  The company may also consider an acquisition in the range
of 150 million pounds to 200 million pounds, Price said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
