Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Slovak factory will
extend its non-stop production regime until the end of this year
on rising demand, spokesman Vladimir Machalik said.  Round-the-clock production at the factory in Bratislava
started in September 2010 and was scheduled to end this month.
The change won’t affect a plan for a companywide holiday during
summer, Machalik said in an e-mailed statement today without
elaborating.  The Bratislava factory assembles Volkswagen Touareg and
Audi-brand Q7 sport-utility vehicles as well as bodies for
Porsche Cayenne. The unit produced 144,500 cars last year and is
preparing for serial production of the so-called New Small
Family cars later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
