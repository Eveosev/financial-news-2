Overseas investors sold a net 2.68
billion rupees ($60 million) of Indian stocks yesterday, taking
their total withdrawals from equities this year to 24.1 billion
rupees, the nation’s markets regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 18.4 billion rupees of shares and sold
21.1 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They sold 5.65 billion rupees of bonds, paring their
debt purchases this year to 143.5 billion rupees.  Overseas investors bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. The Sensex has
fallen 13.6 percent this year, the most among Asian benchmark
indexes tracked by Bloomberg.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.447 trillion rupees in equities and 930.2 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
