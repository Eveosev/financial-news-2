Wildcard Sabine Lisicki of Germany
defeated third-seeded  Li Na  in the second round of the Wimbledon
tennis tournament.  The 21-year-old won 3-6, 6-4, 8-6. She saved two match
points to defeat the 29-year-old Chinese player. In 2009,
Lisicki became the first German woman to reach the Wimbledon
quarterfinals since Steffi Graf in 1999. She is ranked 62nd by
the womenâ€™s WTA tennis tour.  Li won the title at Roland Garros earlier this month after
making the final of the Australian Open. Her best performance at
Wimbledon is the quarterfinals, where she lost to  Kim Clijsters 
in 2006. Clijsters also defeated her this year in Melbourne.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
