New Jersey Transit  said service on
its Northeast Corridor, North Jersey Coast Line and Midtown
Direct was temporarily suspended because of an  Amtrak  power
supply problem. The agency commented in an e-mailed statement.  Amtrak said in a separate statement that its service
between Philadelphia and  New York City  was disrupted, and
passengers should expect delays as crews work to restore power.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
