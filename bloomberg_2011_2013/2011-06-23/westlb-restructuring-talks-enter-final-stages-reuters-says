WestLB AG’s restructuring talks are
entering their final stage, with agreement in three areas yet to
be reached a week before a European Union deadline, Reuters
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  German federal and local government officials as well as
representatives from the country’s savings and loans banks are
yet to settle how they will share the costs of the restructuring
and how much capital the lender will get, Reuters said.  The eventual status of 3 billion euros ($4.2 billion) of
so-called silent capital injected by the federal government is
also still to be determined, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
