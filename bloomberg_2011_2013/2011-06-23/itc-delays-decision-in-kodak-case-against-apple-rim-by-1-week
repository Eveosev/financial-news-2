A final ruling scheduled for today
in  Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) ’s patent-infringement case against  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  and  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  was pushed back one week by the
U.S. International Trade Commission.  The target date for a decision by the six-member commission
is extended until June 30, the Washington-based agency said in a
 notice  on its website without providing a reason.  The commission is reviewing a judge’s January finding that
Apple’s iPhone and RIM’s BlackBerry don’t violate Kodak’s patent
on a way to preview digital images using less processing power
and storage space.  Kodak Chief Executive Officer Antonio Perez in March
estimated the Rochester, New York-based company could make $1
billion from Apple and RIM if it wins the case because the
phonemakers would be forced to settle rather than risk having
their best-selling products shut out of the U.S. market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
