The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development is mulling an approval of a 70 million euro
($100 million) loan to Bosnia-Herzegovina for highway
construction in the northern part of the former Yugoslav nation.  The loan, which needs to be approved by EBRDâ€™s board, would
be given to the state-owned Republika Srpska Motorways for
building a 76 kilometer-long (48 miles) stretch of the road
between the cities of Banja Luka and Doboj, the London-based
lender said on its  website  late yesterday.  The total cost of the project is estimated at 185 million
euros, with 140 million euros coming from international
financial institutions and 45 million euros from Republika
Srpska Motorways, the lender said.  Bosnia-Herzegovina, wedged between  Croatia ,  Serbia ,
Montenegro and the Adriatic Sea, is seeking to rebuild its
Communist-era infrastructure, devastated during the ethnic wars
in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, as it aims to accelerate its
economic recovery.  The EBRD was established to help nations in Eastern Europe
and the former  Soviet Union  with their transition to market
economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
