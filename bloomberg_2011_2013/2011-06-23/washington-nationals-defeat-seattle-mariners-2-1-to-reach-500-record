The  Washington Nationals  defeated
the Seattle Mariners 2-1 in an interleague Major League Baseball
game to reach .500 for the season.  The Nationals have won 10 of their past 11 games to improve
to 37-37 for the season. The National League team has never
finished a season above .500, although it ended its 2005
inaugural year in Washington at 81-81.  “I’ve never been on a team that’s been this far into the
season and been at .500,” winning pitcher John Lannan told
reporters. “I like it, but it’s time to kind of move past that
and set new goals and start going above it.”  The Nationals reached 18-18 on May 11, although the last
time they were at .500 this late in the season was in 2005, when
they were 42-30 on June 22. The team never attained a .500
record in 2007 and 2009.  Washington ’s Ryan Zimmerman said the milestone meant
“nothing.”  “If we continue to play good, then it will mean more at
the end of the season,” he told reporters. “A ton of teams
are .500 in June.”  The Nationals are third in the five-team  National League
East , 9.5 games behind the division-leading  Philadelphia
Phillies .  In last night’s game at Nationals Park in Washington, Danny Espinosa scored Zimmerman on a first-inning single to give the
Nationals the lead.  Miguel Olivo tied it with a run-scoring single in the
fourth for the Mariners (37-37) before Jerry Hairston Jr. drove
in Espinosa for the go-ahead run.  Lannan (5-5) gave up three hits, one run and struck out
three in 5 2/3 innings. Drew Storen got his 18th save by
pitching a perfect ninth inning.  Erik Bedard (4-5) took the loss after surrendering two runs
and three hits in six innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
