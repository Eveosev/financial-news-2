Trafigura Beheer BV sold  North Sea 
Forties crude at a higher price. Glencore International Plc
failed to buy Russian Urals in the Mediterranean for the third
day even after it raised its bid.  North Sea  Trafigura sold one cargo of Forties for loading July 10 to
July 12 to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at 5 cents below Dated Brent,
compared with a discount of 8 cents for a cargo it sold on June
20, according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts trading window.  Trafigura failed to sell another shipment of Forties for
July 8 to July 10 at parity to Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days is 1 cent below
Dated Brent, compared with a parity yesterday, according to
Bloomberg data.  Brent for August settlement traded at $108.09 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the
window, down from $113.42 yesterday. The September contract was
at $107.93, 16 cents less than August.  Two cargoes of North Sea Forties crude have been added to
the July loading schedule, according to a revised shipping plan
obtained by Bloomberg News. The two shipments are for loading
July 26 to July 28 and July 29 to July 31, the plan showed.  Three cargoes were deferred earlier this month. A fourth
cargo was deferred to July from June, according to the plan. The
cargo, originally planned for June 24 to June 26, is now for
loading on July 2 to July 4.  This will bring the total number of cargoes for July to 24,
compared with the original plan for 18. All shipments are
600,000 barrels each.  Mediterranean/Urals  Glencore sought to buy 80,000 metric tons of Urals in the
Mediterranean for July 4 to July 8 delivery at $2.15 a barrel
below Dated Brent without success, 30 cents more than its
yesterday’s bid, according to the survey.  OAO Lukoil failed to buy the same volume for July 10 to
July 14 at $2 less than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for Urals in northwest Europe
for the sixth session.  West Africa  A cargo of Nigeria benchmark Qua Iboe for July 2 to July 3
at an unknown price, said traders involved in the transactions
of the region’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
