The  Philadelphia Flyers  will play
host to the New York Rangers in the Winter Classic on Jan. 2 in
Citizens Bank Park, the  National Hockey League  said today as it
released the 2011-12 schedule.  The Boston Bruins will raise their Stanley Cup championship
banner for the first time since 1972 when they host the Flyers
in an opening-night triple-header Oct. 6. The  Toronto Maple
Leafs  host the Montreal Canadiens and the Pittsburgh Penguins
travel to play the Vancouver Canucks that night.  Meanwhile, Winnipeg welcomes the NHL back for the first
time in 15 years when it hosts Montreal at the MTS Centre on
Oct. 9.  The schedule was released as the Flyers traded team captain
 Mike Richards  to the Los Angeles Kings and leading goal-scorer
Jeff Carter to the Columbus Blue Jackets, the  Philadelphia Daily
News  reported.  Calls to Flyers spokesman Zack Hill weren’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
