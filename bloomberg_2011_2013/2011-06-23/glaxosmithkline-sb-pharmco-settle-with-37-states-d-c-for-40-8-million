GlaxoSmithKline LLC and SB Pharmco
 Puerto Rico  Inc. entered into a $40.8 million accord with 37
U.S. states and the  District of Columbia  to resolve allegations
they breached drug manufacturing standards, Illinois Attorney
General Lisa Madigan said.  Madigan, in a press statement issued today, said that
between 2001 and 2004 the companies made bad batches of the
anti-nausea drug Kytril, which is used by chemotherapy patients;
Avandamet, a drug used to treat diabetes; the antidepressant
Paxil CR and the antibiotic topical treatment Bactroban.  “Consumers put their faith in drug companies that the
medications they purchase are safe,” the attorney general said.
“My office will not tolerate pharmaceutical companies cutting
corners at the potential expense of consumer health.”  Madigan, in a complaint and settlement agreement she said
was filed today at the  Illinois  state courthouse in  Chicago ,
accused the drug companies of unfair and deceptive practices.  “There is no current cause for concern for patients,” she
said, adding that the products in question had previously been
recalled or have since expired and the manufacturing facility
has closed.  “The company chose to settle the matter, which it
initially disclosed in its 2010 fourth quarter results and its
2010 annual report, to avoid the expense and uncertainty of
protracted litigation and trial,” according to a
GlaxoSmithKline statement issued today.  The drugmaker, which has offices in Philadelphia and
Research Triangle Park,  North Carolina , didn’t admit to any
wrongdoing or liability. The company is a unit of London-based
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK)   SB Pharmco Puerto Rico is also a GlaxoSmithKline unit.  The settlement money will be divided among Illinois,
Oregon, 35 other states and the District of Columbia, according
to Madigan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
