TNK-BP said Ukraine may have enough
gas to meet demand in 2023 if shale deposits are developed.  TNK-BP plans to bid for Ukrainian shale gas licenses and
will use  BP Plc (BP/) ’s technology to tap deposits, said Didier Casimiro, who heads its Ukraine operations. The company is
interested in exploring for unconventional gas in the Luhansk
and Donetsk regions.  Ukraine may pump about 35 billion cubic meters of
unconventional gas in 2023 on top of conventional output,
Casimiro estimated. The nation is expected to produce about 20
billion cubic meters of natural gas this year, short of demand
of 60 billion cubic meters. The gap will be met by Russian
imports.  “There is a lot of interest” in Ukrainian shale gas
resources, Casimiro told reporters today in  London . “There is a
lot to be done in the country” to make investment attractive,
he said.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and
 Eni SpA (ENI)  have been examining plans to explore for gas in Ukraine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
