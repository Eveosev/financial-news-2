The French economy will grow at its
fastest pace since 2007 this year as companies step up
investment and falling unemployment spurs  consumer spending ,
according to national statistics office Insee.  Gross domestic product will expand by about 2.1 percent,
compared with a 1.5 percent gain last year and a 2.3 percent
advance in 2007, Insee said in a report released today.  The forecast reflects  France ’s recovery from recession at a
time when rising food and energy prices, as well as higher
 interest rates , are threatening disposable income and demand.
The pressure on incomes will probably cause growth to slow to
0.2 percent in the second quarter from 1 percent in the first
three months as consumer spending slips.  “Household spending will show a significant drop in the
second quarter,” Insee said. “Yet this will be a one-off
slowdown that won’t threaten the dynamic of the recovery that
has been in place for the past two years.”  Full-year consumer spending will expand 1.2 percent, while
investment by non-financial companies will jump 5.9 percent,
Insee estimated. Foreign trade will produce a net 0.6 percent
drag on GDP, it said.  Insee expects France to generate 179,000 new jobs this
year, reducing the  unemployment rate  to 9.4 percent from 9.7
percent at the end of the first quarter.  Inflation will peak in October at 2.5 percent and then
retreat, making for an average increase in consumer prices of
2.2 percent in the year, Insee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
