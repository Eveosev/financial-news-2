Lavazza Chief Executive Officer
Antonio Baravalle said it’s “premature” to say the company
will raise its stake in  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)  from
about 6 percent,  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported, citing an interview.  Baravalle said he would go to the U.S. next week to meet
with the management of Green Mountain. Turin, Italy-based
Lavazza also has a partnership with Waterbury, Vermont-based
Green Mountain, according to the Italian newspaper.  Lavazza will consider acquisitions in markets where it
doesn’t already operate, including China, and needs to “create
value” from acquisitions it has already made, Baravalle said,
according to the daily.  To contact the reporter on this story:
