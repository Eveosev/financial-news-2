The ruble weakened the most versus
the dollar in a month after the  International Energy Agency 
announced it will release 60 million barrels of oil from
emergency stockpiles, driving down the price of  Russia ’s chief
export earner.  The ruble depreciated 0.9 percent to 28.24 per dollar at
the 5 p.m. close in Moscow, the sharpest drop since May 23. The
ruble was 0.7 percent stronger at 39.9875 per euro, leaving it
little changed at 33.5264 versus the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  “The ruble weakened towards the end of the session as oil
headed sharply lower,”  Denis Korshilov , the Moscow-based head
of fixed income, currencies and commodities in Russia at
Citigroup Inc., wrote in response to e-mailed questions.  The IEA said the oil would be released from around the end
of next week, only the third time the organization has
coordinated the use of emergency stockpiles since the agency was
founded in 1974. Crude for August delivery dropped as much as
$4.85 to $90.56 a barrel before the ruble’s close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
