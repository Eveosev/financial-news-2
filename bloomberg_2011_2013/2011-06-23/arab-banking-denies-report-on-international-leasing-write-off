Arab Banking Corp. denied reaching
an agreement to write off money owed by International Leasing &
Investment Co.  “Arab Banking Corp. acts as agent for a syndicate of banks
that have provided a loan to International Leasing & Investment
Co. that in total is $120 million,” the Bahraini bank said in an
e-mailed statement today. “The exposure of Arab Banking Corp. is
only a small portion of this amount. No agreement has been
reached with International Leasing to write off any of the
debt.”  Kuwait-based  Al-Seyassah  reported yesterday Arab Banking
Corp. wrote off 90 percent of the $120 million debt owed to it
by International Leasing. The newspaper cited unidentified
people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
