J.K. Rowling , the billionaire author
of the  Harry Potter  books, started an Internet venture to sell
electronic versions of the novels and publish material about the
boy wizard.  Pottermore.com will be a free-to-use website with
“extensive new material about the characters, places and
objects,” Rowling’s publisher  Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (BMY)  said in
a statement today. From October, the website will incorporate an
online shop to sell all seven of Harry Potter novels as e-Books.  “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” the final Harry
Potter novel, was released in July 2007, ending a series of
books that began in 1997. Rowling broke a publishing industry
record when the latest book sold 8.3 million copies in its first
24 hours and 11.5 million copies in its first 10 days.  Authors and book companies are pushing electronic versions
of books into the market to benefit from the boom in devices
such as Amazon.com Inc.’s Kindle and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad.
Bloomsbury, whose e-book sales rose to 1.5 million pounds ($2.4
million) last year from 79,000 pounds in 2009, said today it
will get a share of the sales from the Pottermore venture.  Bloomsbury dropped 0.8 percent to 126.25 pence at 1:25 p.m.
in  London , valuing the company at 93 million pounds.  Scholastic Corp., the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter
novels, said in a separate statement that it will receive a
royalty on sales of the U.S. e-books editions.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
