Supply and demand for tankers that
transport about 46 percent of the world’s crude oil may be
improving, according to data from  Clarkson Research  Services
Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest shipbroker.  Demand to ship oil will expand 3.8 percent this year,
Clarkson Research said in a monthly report on its website today,
revising upward an estimate of 3.2 percent made last month. The
fleet will expand more slowly, swelling 7.1 percent rather than
the 7.4 percent Clarkson forecast in May.  Global seaborne crude oil imports will average 40.7 million
barrels a day this year, Clarkson estimates. By contrast, global
oil demand will be 89.3 million barrels a day, estimates the
 International Energy Agency , adviser to 28 oil-consuming
nations.  Clarkson Research is a unit of Clarkson Plc, the world’s
largest shipbroker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
