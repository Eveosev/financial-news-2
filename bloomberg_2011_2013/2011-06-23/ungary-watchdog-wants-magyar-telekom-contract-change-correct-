(Corrects date of press conference in second paragraph.)  Hungary’s telecommunications
watchdog issued a decree calling on Magyar Telekom Nyrt. to
change the terms of its contracts with mobile phone clients to
avoid “shocking bills”, the regulator said in an email
today.  The watchdog, also known as NMHH, will unveil the details
of the decree at a press conference tomorrow, according to the
email.  Magyar Telekom is majority-owned by  Germany ’s Deutsche
Telekom AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
