Hungarian shares fell to the lowest
level in three months, led by Mol Nyrt. and OTP Bank Nyrt. on
concern the global economic recovery and demand for commodities
will falter.  The benchmark BUX index lost 1 percent to 22,304.4 by the 5
p.m. end of trade in Budapest, the lowest closing level since
March 18. OTP,  Hungary ’s largest lender, sank 1 percent to 5,728
forint as more than 825,000 shares changed hands, about 56
percent of the daily average in the past three months. Mol, the
country’s biggest refiner, slid 1.4 percent to 20,900 forint.  Risk signals for financial stability in the euro area are
flashing “red,” European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichetsaid late yesterday in  Frankfurt . Oil tumbled to a four-
month low after the  International Energy Agency  said its members
would release crude from strategic reserves. A report today
showed America’s jobless claims exceeded estimates, adding to
signs the economy is slowing.  “Current market fears are more than just worries about
 Greece , the market has started to price in another global
economic slowdown,” Daniel Orosz, an economist at AXA SA in
Budapest, wrote in an e-mail today.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price estimate for Mol’s
shares to 26,900 forint from 27,600 forint, according to a note
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
