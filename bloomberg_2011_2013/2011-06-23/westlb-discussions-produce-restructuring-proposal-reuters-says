WestLB AG restructuring talks
between German government officials and representatives from the
country’s savings-and-loans banks produced an agreement on how
to split up the bank, Reuters reported, without providing
details.  It was agreed that any profit from WestLB’s bad bank should
be transferred to the scaled-down lender WestLB will become
after the restructuring, the newswire said. The plan has be
filed with the European Union by the end of the month, Reuters
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
