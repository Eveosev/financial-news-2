Group of 20 farm ministers failed
to take measures at a meeting in Paris today that would
immediately improve  food security , according to Thierry
Kesteloot, a policy adviser at charity Oxfam. Following are
comments he made by telephone from Brussels:  “What is positive is that there is a G-20 around the
problems, that there’s a political willingness expressed. In
terms of concrete decisions that can have an immediate effect,
there’s not a whole lot.”  “To have better coordination on the information system,
that’s positive, we recognize that. We’re a bit more skeptical
about how it will work.”  “The grains market, particularly wheat, is a very
concentrated market. We won’t have transparent information
without including the private sector, and there an invitation
is probably insufficient.”  “Stock depletion is something that is not at all
addressed. We need a security margin.” The cost of maintaining
global grain reserves of 105 million metric tons to regulate
prices would be about $1.5 billion, Kesteloot said. “We think
that the costs of an international food crisis are higher.”  The 2007-08 food crisis pushed 150 million people into
poverty and hunger, which could have been avoided at a cost of
$10 a person, according to Kesteloot.  “The decisions taken by the G-20 don’t match the
declarations. There’s a repetition of commitments regarding
hunger that rarely translates into reality. We continue to have
commitment after commitment, which in the end doesn’t translate
into action.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
