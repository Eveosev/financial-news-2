Egypt ’s revised draft budget may
have implications for the country’s request for aid from the
International Monetary Fund, spokesman David Hawley said.  “We’re in close touch with the Egyptian authorities and
they have informed us that they are revising their draft
budget,” Hawley told reporters in Washington today. “We will
review this revision together with the authorities, including
considering its implications for their request for a Fund
arrangement.”  Egypt cut its budget deficit goal for the next fiscal year
after reducing spending in a revised budget, decreasing the
government’s need to tap foreign lenders to finance its budget
deficit, the  Finance Ministry  said yesterday.  “We have yet to learn all the details of the revised
proposal,” Hawley said, adding any announcement of a change in
request for IMF funding would come from the Egyptian
authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
