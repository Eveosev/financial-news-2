Japanese stocks declined for the
first time in four days after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its
forecast for growth in the world’s biggest economy.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a maker of solar panels which gets more than
20 percent of its sales in the U.S., declined 1.7 percent.
Nippon Electric Glass Co., which makes glass for liquid-crystal
displays, fell for a second day after Macquarie Group Ltd. cut
its rating to “underperform.”  Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202)  and  Suzuki
Motor Corp. (7269) , automakers that had delayed earnings forecasts
because of damage from March’s earthquake, climbed after saying
profit will rise this year.  “Stocks have almost priced in the U.S. economic soft patch,
but it should take a while to identify whether the economy will
worsen,” said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about $600 million
in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.3 percent to 9,596.74
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix index declined
0.4 percent to 825.51, with five stocks retreating for every
three that rose.  The Topix has lost 11 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, triggering the worst nuclear accident in 25
years, damaging factories, and leaving more than 23,000 people
dead or missing.  Valuations Drop  The slump pushed valuations on the Topix to 1.2 times book
value, compared with 2.17 on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
1.55 on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. About two thirds of the
1,671 Topix companies trade at less than book value, meaning
investors could theoretically buy the firms at current prices
and liquidate them at a profit.  Kyocera dropped 1.7 percent to 8,140 yen.  Nikon Corp. (7731) , a
camera maker that counts  North America  as its biggest market,
slumped 4.9 percent to 1,926 yen.  Nippon Electric Glass extended yesterday’s decline, falling
5.1 percent, the most on the Nikkei, to 991 yen. The company had
its rating slashed to “underperform” from “outperform” at
Macquarie Group, which forecast three consecutive years of
declining operating profit, according to a report dated June 21.  The glass maker may lose market share to LG Chem Ltd.,
Macquarie said. The South Korean company plans to start mass
production of display glass this year and to supply LG Display
Co. Ltd., a Nippon Electric Glass customer, according to
Macquarie.  U.S. Outlook  Futures on the  S&P 500  slipped 0.2 percent today. The index
lost 0.7 percent yesterday in  New York  after the Fed cut its
projection for U.S. growth and employment this year and next.
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his colleagues forecast the  U.S.
economy , Japan’s second-largest export market behind  China , will
expand by between 2.7 percent and 2.9 percent this year, down
from an April forecast of 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent.  Bernanke said some of the reasons for the slowdown will be
temporary, such as higher commodity prices and supply-chain
disruptions caused by Japan’s earthquake and tsunami. The Fed
Chairman also said the central bank would this month complete
its purchase of $600 billion worth of longer-term Treasuries, a
measure designed to boost growth and asset prices by flooding
the market with cash.  The yen depreciated to as low as 80.64 against the dollar
today, compared with 80.27 at the close of  stock trading  in
Tokyo yesterday after the Fed reiterated it doesn’t intend to
add to its bond purchases. A weaker yen increases the value of
overseas income for  Japan ’s exporters.  ‘Buying the Dollar’  “Investors are buying back the dollar because there’s less
expectation the Fed will take additional easing measures, said
 Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $84
billion. “That’s supportive of Japanese stocks.”  Among shares that gained today, Isuzu climbed the most on
the Nikkei, adding 3.4 percent to 364 yen. The company forecast
net income will rise 26 percent to 65 billion yen ($807 million)
in the year ending March 2012. The target exceeded the median
estimate of 45 billion yen projected by nine analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg before today.  Suzuki Motor, 20 percent owned by Volkswagen AG, jumped 3.1
percent to 1,757 yen. The company forecast net income will rise
11 percent to 50 billion yen this fiscal year as production
recovers from the earthquake.  Nissan Sales  Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest automaker, climbed
1.3 percent to 839 yen and was the most-actively traded stock in
Japan. Sales this fiscal year will be “significantly higher”
than in the previous 12-months, Chief Executive Officer  Carlos
Ghosn  said yesterday ahead of earnings forecasts due today.  Nissan said after the market closed today that it expects
net income of 270 billion yen this year, compared with the 237
billion yen average of five analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg in the past 28 days.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , Japan’s largest maker of the metal,
advanced 1.7 percent to 247 yen. The company raised steel prices
18 percent for April-September shipments to Japan’s biggest
electronics makers, the Nikkei newspaper reported today, without
saying where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
