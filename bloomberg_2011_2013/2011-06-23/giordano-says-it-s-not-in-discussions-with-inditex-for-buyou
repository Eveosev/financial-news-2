Giordano International Ltd. (709) , a Hong
Kong clothing chain with more than 1,000 stores in  China , said
it hasn’t been in contact with  Inditex SA (ITX)  after ET Net reported
the Zara parent planned to buy the Chinese retailer.  “We don’t have any contact with them,” William Yue, a
spokesman at Giordano, said in a phone interview in Hong Kong
today. Inditex hasn’t approached Giordano, a company official,
who declined to be identified citing company policy, said by
phone today.  Giordano gained as much as 5.7 percent to HK$7 in Hong
Kong trading after ET Net, an electronic news provider owned by
Hong Kong Economic Times Holdings Ltd., reported that Inditex
planned to buy the Hong Kong-based company, without citing
anyone. Giordano was up 0.8 percent at HK$6.67 as of 3:45 p.m.
 Hong Kong  time.
