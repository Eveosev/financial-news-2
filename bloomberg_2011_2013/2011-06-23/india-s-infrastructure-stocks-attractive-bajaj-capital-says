Anil Chopra, group chief executive
officer at investment adviser Bajaj Capital Ltd., comments on
the outlook for  India ’s stocks. He spoke in Mumbai.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
0.1 percent to 17,569.58 at 9:55 a.m. local time.  On stocks outlook:  “There’s no good news for the markets in the short term.
Stocks will trade in a narrow range until inflation and interest
rates come down from peak levels.”  On forecast for below normal monsoon:  “The government monsoon estimate is not much off its long
term average. A slightly weaker monsoon won’t have a huge impact
on corporate profitability. We have become far more dependent on
manufacturing and services than on agriculture for economic
growth than in the past.”  Precipitation in the June-September rainy season, the main
source of irrigation for the nation’s 235 million farmers, may
be 95 percent of the 50-year average, the weather office said
June 21. Falls would be 98 percent of the long-period average,
the office said April 19.  On infrastructure stocks:  “We are advising clients to accumulate infrastructure
stocks on a medium-to-long term horizon as current valuations
are attractive. The stocks have fallen sharply due to increase
in commodity prices and high  interest rates . We expect a fast
recovery in infrastructure stocks as soon as project execution
starts happening and lending rates moderate.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
