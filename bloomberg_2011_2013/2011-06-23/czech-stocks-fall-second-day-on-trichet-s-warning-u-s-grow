Czech stocks fell the most in two
months after U.S. jobless claims rose and European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said late yesterday the debt
crisis threatens to infect banks.  The PX equity index tumbled 1.2 percent to 1,210.3 by the
4:27 p.m. close in Prague, the biggest drop since April 18. Coal
producer New World Resources Plc fell 2.3 percent to 237.3
koruna, its fifth day of declines.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech
power utility,  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  each
retreated more than 1.6 percent.  The euro weakened 1.8 percent to the dollar after Trichet
said risk signals for financial stability in the euro area are
flashing “red” and the  Federal Reserve  cut estimates for U.S.
growth. Equities worldwide extended losses after the U.S. Labor
Department said applications for jobless benefits jumped 9,000
in the week ended June 18 to 429,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
