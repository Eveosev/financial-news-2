General Electric Co. (GE)  and its
partners won more than $27 billion in jet engine and service
orders at the Paris Air Show, more than twice as much as the
company predicted at the beginning of the week.  The total was buoyed by AirAsia Bhd.’s order for 400 power
plants from  CFM International , GE’s joint venture with  Safran SA (SAF) 
of France. GE, the world’s biggest maker of jet engines,
predicted June 20 that it would land more than $10 billion in
orders during this week’s show as airlines switch to more
efficient aircraft amid higher fuel prices.  Among the airplane options is Airbus SAS’s upgraded
 A320neo , 200 of which were ordered by AirAsia. CFM’s Leap-X is
vying with  Pratt & Whitney ’s geared turbofan to power the
narrowbody aircraft. The Leap-X has been selected for 455
A320neos and the geared turbofan for 270.  GE’s order mix include $16 billion in engines, some sold
through the Engine Alliance with Pratt, and $11 billion in
service contracts, the company said in a statement today.  Pratt, a division of  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , doesn’t
release its list price for the geared turbofan it supplies for
the A320neo. Analysts including Teal Group estimate both the
geared turbofan and CFM’s Leap-X have list prices of about $12
million, which would value Pratt’s 60 A320neo orders at about
$720 million.  Including that figure, Pratt logged about $1.1 billion in
orders at the show.  GE is based in Fairfield,  Connecticut ; United Technologies
in Hartford, Connecticut and Airbus in Toulouse, France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
