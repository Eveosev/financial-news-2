A Cairo court sentenced an Egyptian
citizen, Tareq Abdel Razeq, to life in prison on charges of
spying for  Israel , the state-run Nile News television reported
today.  The state security court sentenced two Israelis in absentia
to life in prison after convicting the three of espionage
against  Egypt , Syria and Lebanon, the state-run Middle East News
Agency said.  Prosecutors had accused Abdel Razeq of agreeing to provide
the two Israelis with information about telecommunications
officials who might be recruited “to cooperate with the Israeli
intelligence to harm Egypt’s interests,” MENA said.  Diplomatic tensions between Israel and Egypt have risen
since former President  Hosni Mubarak  stepped down in February
after 18 days of protests.  In a separate case, Egypt’s state security prosecutor on
June 12 ordered the detention for 15 days of an Israeli, Ilan
Grapel, on suspicion of spying. Israeli Foreign Ministry
spokesman Yigal Palmor has said that Grapel, who holds both
Israeli and U.S. citizenships, isn’t a spy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
