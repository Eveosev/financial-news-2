Clint Dempsey  scored the only goal
as the U.S. beat Panama to reach its fourth straight Gold Cup
soccer final, where it will play Mexico for the championship.  Dempsey touched in Landon Donovanâ€™s cross in the 76th
minute at Reliant Stadium in Houston last night to send the
Americans to the June 25 title match in Pasadena, California.
Mexico defeated Honduras 2-0 after extra time in the second game
of the semifinal doubleheader.   Mexico leads the U.S. 5-4 in regional soccer titles since
the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean
Association Football started the Gold Cup in 1991.  Canada , in
2000, is the only other country to have won the championship in
its 10 previous editions.      Defending champion Mexico, which routed the U.S. 5-0 in the
2009 final, needed extra-time goals from Aldo De Nigris and
 Javier Hernandez  to beat Honduras after the teams were tied 0-0
at the end of regulation.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
