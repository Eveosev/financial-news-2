BYD Co., the Chinese carmaker backed
by  Warren Buffett , said the online tranche of shares in its
initial public offering in Shenzhen was 21 times oversubscribed.  Demand from institutional investors made the so-called
offline tranche 3.9 times oversubscribed, the Shenzhen-based
company said in a separate stock exchange filing today.  BYD, which wants to raise 1.35 billion yuan ($209 million)
in net proceeds after deducting issuance fees, plans to use part
of the money to expand its vehicle lineup and for research and
development.  The maker of automobiles and batteries will sell a combined
79 million shares at 18 yuan each, the company said on June 19.
The final share price was determined by factors including
investor offers and valuations of comparable companies, it said
at the time.  BYD rose as much as 1.2 percent in Hong Kong trading and
was up 0.5 percent at HK$21.75 as of the 12 p.m. break. The
stock has fallen 47 percent this year, compared with a 5.9
percent decline in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   --Tian Ying. Editors: Subramaniam Sharma, Nicholas Wadhams  To contact the reporter on this story:
