Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped, snapping
a two-day rally, after the  Federal Reserve  lowered its outlook
for the U.S. economy this year, deterring risk taking and
damping demand for emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional stocks fell by the
most in a week after the Fed also lifted its unemployment
forecast yesterday. Global funds reduced holdings of Indonesia’s
 government debt  by 1.7 percent to 233.64 trillion rupiah ($27
billion) from the end of last week through yesterday, data from
the debt-management office show.  “There was some disappointment” because of the U.S. data,
said Ho Woei Chen, a Singapore-based economist at United
Overseas Bank Ltd. “There’s a lack of a catalyst in the market.
The outlook in  Europe  is very unclear.”  The rupiah weakened 0.2 percent to 8,611 per dollar as of
4:55 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency rose as much as 0.2 percent to 8,580 earlier and
has advanced 4.2 percent this year.  The  U.S. economy  will expand from 2.7 percent to 2.9
percent this year, down from April’s forecast of 3.1 percent to
3.3 percent, the Fed said. The jobless rate will average 8.6
percent to 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with
April’s projection of 8.4 percent to 8.7 percent, the monetary
authority estimated.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
yesterday risk signals for financial stability in the euro area
are flashing “red” as the debt crisis threatens to infect
banks.  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds rose for a second day.
The yield on the 8.25 percent security due July 2021 fell seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.50 percent,
according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
