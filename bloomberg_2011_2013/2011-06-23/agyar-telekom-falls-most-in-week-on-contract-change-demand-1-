Magyar Telekom Nyrt. fell the most
in a week after  Hungary ’s telecommunications watchdog called on
the country’s former phone monopoly to change the terms of its
contracts with mobile-phone clients to avoid “shocking bills.”  Shares in Magyar Telekom, majority-owned by  Germany ’s
Deutsche Telekom AG, dropped 1.2 percent to 577 forint as of the
5 p.m. end of trading in Budapest, the biggest slump since June
16. Investors bought and sold 1.78 million shares, more than 78
percent of the 3-month average. The benchmark BUX index of
shares, in which Magyar Telekom has a 13 percent weighting,
dropped 1 percent.  The watchdog, also known as NMHH, will unveil details of
its decree at a press conference tomorrow, the agency said in an
e-mail today.  Magyar Telekom’s shares “may come under some pressure”
because of the regulator’s decree, Akos Herczenik and Levente Blaho, analysts at Raiffeisen Bank International AG in Budapest
wrote in a research note.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
