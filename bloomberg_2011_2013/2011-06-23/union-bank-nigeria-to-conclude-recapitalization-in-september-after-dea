Union Bank Nigeria Plc (UBN) , a Nigerian
lender, plans to conclude a recapitalization program in
September after reaching an agreement with investors, Chief
Executive Officer Funke Osibodu said.  A “transaction implementation agreement” will be signed
“early in July” with African Capital Alliance, a private
equity company, for the purpose of injecting new funds into the
bank, she told reporters in Lagos today. Additional funding to
meet  capital requirements  will come from the Asset Management
Corp. of  Nigeria  and shareholders, she said, adding that about
290 billion naira ($1.85 billion) is needed to restore its
capital adequacy position.  A debt crisis arising from loans to speculators on the
Nigerian stock market and companies in the crude oil and natural
gas industry threatened the banking industry with collapse,
prompting the  Central Bank  of Nigeria to bail out eight lenders
with 620 billion naira in 2009. The affected lenders have until
Sept. 30 to re capitalize or face liquidation, according to the
central bank.  Union Bank will have an implementation document ready for
approval by regulators in August, said Osibodu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
