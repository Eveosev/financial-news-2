DRDGold Ltd. (DRD) , a producer of the
metal in  South Africa , said its board has decided to suspend
financial assistance to its 74 percent-owned unit,
Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining Co.  Blyvooruitzicht’s gold production is declining and costs
are increasing, Johannesburg-based DRDGold said in a statement
today. Blyvooruitzicht requires about 80 million rand ($11.7
million) in financial assistance through December 2011, the
company said.  Blyvooruitzicht’s board has decided to begin “business
rescue proceedings” in response, DRDGold said. These
proceedings won’t interfere with talks to sell all or part of
its holding in Blyvooruitzicht.  To contact the reporter on this story:
