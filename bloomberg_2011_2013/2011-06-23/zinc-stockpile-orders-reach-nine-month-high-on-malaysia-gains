Orders to remove zinc from
stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange climbed to the
highest level in almost nine months on increases in  Malaysia .  The orders, known as canceled warrants, rose 10,450 metric
tons, or 27 percent, to 48,875 tons, the most since Sept. 29,
daily LME figures showed. Canceled warrants have more than
quadrupled in six sessions. Gains were biggest in Johor and Port
Klang. Zinc inventories rose for the first time in six days to
868,125 tons.  Canceled warrants for lead rose 675 tons to 36,400 tons,
the highest level since at least October 1997, after more than
doubling yesterday in  Singapore . Today’s increase was in Port
Klang. Lead inventories rose 175 tons to 321,775 tons.  The jump in Singapore “could well be metal simply moving
from one warehouse to another there as part of a rent deal,”
Royal Bank of Canada  Europe  Ltd. said in a report yesterday.  Aluminum inventories dropped for a 21st day to the lowest
level in more than four months, declining in  Asia , the U.S. and
Europe. Stockpiles declined 11,125 tons to 4.56 million tons,
the lowest level since Feb. 4. Canceled warrants fell for an
eighth day to 469,650 tons.  Copper inventories slid 500 tons to 474,025 tons, while
canceled warrants declined 2,350 tons to 34,675 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
