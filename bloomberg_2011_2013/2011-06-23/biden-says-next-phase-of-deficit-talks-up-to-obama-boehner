Vice President  Joe Biden , who has
been leading negotiations between the administration and members
of Congress on reducing the budget deficit, said the next step
in the talks is up to President Barack Obama and House Speaker
 John Boehner .  “The goal of these talks was to report our findings back
to our respective leaders,” Biden said in a statement. “The
next phase is in the hands of those leaders, who need to
determine the scope of an agreement that can tackle the problem
and attract bipartisan support.”  The negotiations, which revolve around the need to raise
the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling by Aug. 2, broke down
today when Republicans Jon Kyl, an Arizona senator, and  Eric Cantor , a Virginia representative, withdrew.  “For now the talks are in abeyance,” Biden said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
