European Union leaders urged  Greece 
to pass a package of budget cuts and vowed to do what’s needed
to meet the country’s financing needs in July, the EU said in a
statement in Brussels today.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said he received the
support of the country’s EU partners during the first day of a
summit meeting.  “This is not only a green light but also a positive sign
for the future of Greece,” Papandreou told reporters.  The EU leaders welcomed Greece’s “strong commitment” to
containing debt and deficit. They also endorsed the voluntary
participation of investors in a rescue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
