Alvarion Ltd. (ALVR)  surged the most in
almost eight months after the shares of the maker of wireless
telecommunications equipment tumbled to the lowest level since
the stock began trading in  Tel Aviv .  The shares jumped 12 percent, the most since Oct. 26, to
4.668 shekels at 11:47 a.m. in Tel Aviv, trimming the decline
this year to 45 percent. The stock has gained 17 percent from
the June 21 close of 3.998 shekels, the lowest level since
shares began trading in Tel Aviv in 2001, according to Bloomberg
data.  “It looks like a technical correction after the shares
reached cash value,” David Levinson, an analyst at Bank
Hapoalim Ltd. in Tel Aviv who has an “underperform”
recommendation on the stock, said by telephone today.  Alvarion had cash and near-cash items of 69.2 million as of
March 31, the Bloomberg data show.  Levinson said he will reevaluate his recommendation when
there’s “balance” in the company’s profit and loss and cash
flow reports and its strategy is established.  To contact the reporter on this story:
