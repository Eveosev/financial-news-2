A painting of a Hindu goddess sold
for more than three times its estimate at a $4 million online
auction by a Mumbai-based company as demand for Indian artworks
is boosted by the country’s growing number of billionaires.  The green goddess picture fetched $1.3 million, beating a
top estimate of $402,300. Rival collectors pushed 53 percent of
the lots above high estimates, with 72 percent of the items
finding buyers, the  Saffronart  auction house said on June 21.  Works by Brazilian, Russian, Indian and Chinese artists
have risen in value as emerging-market wealth develops.  India 
has ranked behind  China  as the briskest-growing major economy
for much of the past decade, giving rise to a class of
entrepreneurs and billionaires.  The untitled picture of the goddess Kali was by Tyeb Mehta,
who died in 2009. Kali is shown against a dark-brown background,
looking less menacing than in the usual blood-splattered images
of her garlanded with the heads of demons she has killed.  G. Ravinder Reddy’s untitled gilded head fetched $262,055,
while Jehangir Sabavala’s “The Bangle Sellers” sold for
$201,250, Saffronart said in a statement. A work by Manjit Bawa,
who died in 2008, titled “Nayika” fetched $248,780, while Syed
Haider Raza’s “Carcassonne” sold for $218,500. Raza, 89,
graduated from the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris.  The South Asian nation is home to 55 billionaires,
according to Forbes magazine. Worldwide, there were a record
number of billionaires in 2011, with 1,210 in total, compared
with the previous high of 1,125 in 2008.  The sale follows a June 9 auction at Christie’s
International in  London  of works by Mehta, Francis Newton Souza,
India’s priciest modern artist, and Subodh Gupta among others,
which raised $4.3 million pounds ($7 million).  The Christie’s  auction  included an untitled painting by
Mehta that sold for 1.97 million pounds, a record for a work by
the artist. Raza’s “Saurashtra” sold for 2.4 million pounds in
June 2010 in a Christie’s auction, a record for a modern or
contemporary Indian work of art.  To contact the reporter on this story:
