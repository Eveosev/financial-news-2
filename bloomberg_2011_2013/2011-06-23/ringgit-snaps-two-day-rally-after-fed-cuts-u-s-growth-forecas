Malaysia’s ringgit snapped a two-day
rally after policy makers in the U.S. cut their growth forecast
for the world’s biggest economy, boosting demand for the
perceived safety of the dollar.  The Dollar Index traded on ICE Futures climbed for a second
day after the  Federal Reserve  said yesterday the  U.S. economy 
will expand as much as 2.9 percent this year, compared with a
prediction of 3.3 percent made in April. The ringgit dropped
from near its strongest level in two weeks after European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said risk signals for
financial stability in the euro area are flashing “red” as
 Greece ’s debt crisis threatens to infect banks.  “The unresolved Greek debt woes and the weaker economic
outlook in the U.S. are weighing on sentiment,” said D.
Sivadass, a foreign-exchange forwards trader at EON Capital Bhd.
in Kuala Lumpur. “In times of turmoil, the dollar is the safe
currency.”  The ringgit declined 0.3 percent to 3.0330 per dollar as of
4:35 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency reached 3.0195 yesterday, the strongest
level since June 10.  Malaysian  government bonds  gained before an official report
tomorrow that economists predict will show consumer prices rose
3.3 percent in May from a year earlier, the most since March
2009. The yield on the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016
dropped two basis points or 0.02 percentage point to 3.49
percent, the lowest in nearly two weeks, according to Bursa
Malaysia.  The treasury will sell two billion ringgit ($659 million)
of 20-year notes maturing in June 2031 at an auction on June 29,
 Bank Negara Malaysia  announced on its website today. It last
sold similar-maturity debt in April, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
