Cyta , Cyprus’s largest
telecommunications services provider, and  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) 
said they will build the first underwater ring network between
the east Mediterranean island and  Greece .  The new Athena submarine cable subsystem is scheduled to
start commercial operations by the end of the year, Nicosia-
based Cyta said today in an e-mailed statement.  The system will leverage the recently upgraded Minerva
underwater telecommunications cable that links Cyprus to Italy
via the Greek island of Crete and that is operated by
MedNautilus, a unit of Telecom Italia Sparkle, Telecom Italia’s
international wholesale and retail business arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
