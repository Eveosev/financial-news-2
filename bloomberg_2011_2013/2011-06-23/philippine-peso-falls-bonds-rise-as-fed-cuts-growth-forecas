The Philippine peso dropped from a
one-week high and bonds fell after the  Federal Reserve  cut its
economic growth forecast for the U.S., the Asian nation’s
second-largest destination for exports.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares declined, snapping a
two-day gain, after the Fed said gross domestic product will
increase 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent this year, down from a
prediction in April of 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent. European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said yesterday risk
signals for financial stability in the euro area are flashing
“red” as the debt crisis threatens to infect banks.  “It seems the U.S. and  Europe  aren’t doing well and these
concerns are damping the peso,” said Rafael Algarra, treasurer
at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “The market feels the slow
recovery in the U.S. will be prolonged.”  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 43.487 per dollar as of the
4 p.m. close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
yield on the government’s benchmark 7.375 percent notes due
March 2021 climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 6.45 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  Growth in Philippine exports, which account for a third of
the $161 billion economy, accelerated to 19.1 percent in April
from a year earlier, the fastest pace in four months, official
data showed on June 10.  To contact the reporter for this story:
