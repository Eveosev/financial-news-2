Light Louisiana Sweet crude in the
U.S. Gulf Coast weakened the most since April after the Energy
Department said it would release emergency oil stockpiles.  The department will release 30 million barrels of mostly
light, sweet, crude from storage facilities along the  Gulf of
Mexico  to help meet supply global disruptions caused by the war
in Libya, according to a senior administration official.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium slumped $1.50 to $19 a
barrel over West Texas Intermediate as of 2:36 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the largest
single-day price drop since April 19. Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost
$1.60 to $18.75 over the benchmark.  The gap between WTI and more-expensive  Brent crude  narrowed
to $16.31 a barrel from $18.80 yesterday, while the premium of
LLS over Brent slipped 39 cents to $1.25 a barrel.  “We would expect to see the initial surplus of crude oil
appear on the U.S. Gulf Coast,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analysts including New York-based  David Greely , said in a report
today. The gap between Light Louisiana Sweet and Brent is likely
to widen “in order to direct light sweet crude supplies toward
Europe and Asia and away from the resulting surplus on the U.S.
Gulf Coast,” the analysts said.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed $2.50 to $13 a barrel, while Poseidon lost 75
cents to $12.25 over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed $1 to $11.50 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 20 cents to
$1.50. Thunder Horse’s premium lost $2.40 to $17 a barrel.  The premium for Syncrude narrowed 50 cents to $8. Syncrude
is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands 
in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 25 cents to
$20.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
