Taiwan ’s dollar weakened, halting a
two-day rally, after the  Federal Reserve  trimmed its growth
forecast for the  U.S. economy , hurting the outlook for the
island’s exports.  The Fed maintained a pledge to keep  interest rates  low for
an “extended period” as it predicted the economy will expand
as much as 2.9 percent this year, less than its April estimate
of 3.3 percent. The U.S. is the second-biggest buyer of Taiwan’s
overseas shipments. The island’s currency has weakened 0.6
percent this month as overseas investors sold $1.2 billion more
local equities than they bought during the period, exchange data
show.  “Foreign investors are still dumping Taiwan stocks,
weighing on the currency,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based
currency trader at the Union Bank of Taiwan. “Exporters still
hold a lot of foreign currencies and have interest to sell them
when the  Taiwan dollar  weakens, putting the currency’s move in a
narrow range.”  The Taiwan dollar lost 0.2 percent to NT$28.936 against the
greenback as of the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
The benchmark Taiex Index of shares dropped 0.6 percent.  The yield on the 1.375 percent bond due March 2021 held at
1.51 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.34 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
