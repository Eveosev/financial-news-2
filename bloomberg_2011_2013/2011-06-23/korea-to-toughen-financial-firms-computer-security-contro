South Korea  will pursue tougher
sanctions against executives and financial companies for future
breaches of computer security, the government regulator said.  The government will ask that chief executive officers take
responsibility for security accidents and will require financial
companies to appoint chief information security officers, the
 Financial Services Commission  said in an e-mailed statement
today. The FSC will also set rules for companies to maintain a
certain budget and workforce for information security.  The move comes after South Korean prosecutors said on May 3
that  North Korea  was responsible for paralyzing the computer
network at the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation,
known as Nonghyup, in April. The incident disrupted automated
teller machine and online banking services for almost 20 million
Nonghyup clients.  Hyundai Capital Services Inc., a consumer-finance unit of
Hyundai Motor Co., said in April that information for more than
420,000 of its clients was stolen by hackers.  The regulator will set rules to allow business suspensions
when security accidents “severely” hurt the public interest,
it said. It will also impose stricter penalties against hackers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
