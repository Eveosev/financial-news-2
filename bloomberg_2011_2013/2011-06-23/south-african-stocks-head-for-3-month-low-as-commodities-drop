South African stocks slid to a
three-month low as U.S. jobless claims rose and tumbling
commodity prices were a drag on the stocks of mining companies
BHP Billiton Plc and  Anglo American Plc. (AAL)   The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index weakened 1.5 percent to
30,326.54 at the 5 p.m. close of trading in Johannesburg, the
lowest level since March 15.  Applications for U.S. jobless benefits increased 9,000 in
the week ended June 18 to 429,000, Labor Department figures
showed. European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet also
said risk signals for euro area financial stability are flashing
“red.” The U.S.  Federal Reserve  reduced its growth and
employment forecasts for the world’s biggest economy, worsening
the outlook for demand. Copper, nickel and zinc dropped in
London trading as concern mounted  Greece  will fail to repay all
its debt.  “We continue to take our cue from global markets as
worries over the Greek debt story continues,” Renaissance BJM,
a Johannesburg-based brokerage, said in an e-mailed note to
clients.  BHP Billiton  declined for a second day, falling 2.4 percent
to 246.46 rand, while Anglo American dropped 3 percent to 309.49
rand, snapping two days of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
