The cost of protecting Japanese and
Australian corporate bonds from default increased, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 1.5 basis points to
131.5 basis points as of 9:35 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 0.5 basis point
to 117 as of 10:40 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit Agricole
CIB. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 0.5 basis point to 119 as of 8:40
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
