Egypt  raised less than half of the 7
billion Egyptian pounds ($1.2 billion) it sought at a treasury
bill sale today as the average yield on the six-month yield
jumped the most in more than a month.  The Arab country’s  Ministry of Finance  accepted bids for 2
billion pounds in six-month notes out of the 3.5 billion pounds
it targeted. The average yield advanced 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 12.791 percent compared with an auction of
similar maturity bills last week. It sold 1.1 billion pounds of
one-year securities at an average yield of 12.982 percent, the
highest level since November 2008.  “They’re trying to avoid paying a higher cost for
borrowing but that strategy may only be sustainable for another
three to six months,” Mohamed El Sadat, deputy head of fixed
income at BNP Paribas Egypt, said by telephone. “In the long
term the government risks not being able to raise the money it
needs from short-maturity sales as their yields will rise as
well.”  Egypt has increased its reliance on short-maturity treasury
bills since the January uprising that ousted President  Hosni
Mubarak  the following month, forcing the economy to contract in
the last quarter and borrowing costs to rise at the weekly
auctions. The  Finance Ministry  has missed its fund-raising
target in the last 10 auctions of one-year bills as the yield
advanced 254 basis points since the last pre-revolt sale.  Egypt yesterday cut its  budget deficit  target for the next
fiscal year starting July after reducing spending in a revised
budget, the Finance Ministry said. The changes will decrease the
government’s need to tap foreign lenders to finance the budget
deficit, it said. The ministry will target a deficit of 8.6
percent compared with 11 percent in the budget announced June 1.  The yield on the 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due in
April 2020 fell three basis points to 5.66 percent at 4:33 p.m.
in Cairo. The pound dropped 0.1 percent to 5.9706 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
