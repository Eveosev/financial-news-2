Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , rose by the most in four months, data from a unit
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, gained 16 percent
to 20.8 million barrels in the seven days to June 22,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Stockpiles increased by the most since the week ended
Feb. 23, when they climbed 19 percent.  Supplies of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, fell 4.3 percent to 14.1 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline increased
3.8 percent to 9.6 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
