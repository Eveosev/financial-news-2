Ukrainian sunflower-oil production
probably will be unchanged in the coming marketing year at
around 3 million metric tons, according to Ukroliyaprom, which
represents local oil processors.  Exports in the year starting Sept. 1 also will match the
current period’s shipments, estimated at 2.6 million tons,
Stepan Kapshuk, the group’s president, said in a phone interview
from his office in Kiev.  Shipments of the oil have reached 2.1 million tons so far
in the current year, he said. Sunflower-seed exports from
September through May came to 410,000 tons, exceeding the
357,000 tons shipped in the entire 2009-10 season.  Ukraine may be able to export as much as 3 million tons of
sunflower seeds annually if the government were to scrap a tax
on outbound shipments, Kapshuk said. The state levies an 11
percent duty on foreign deliveries that may be removed if the
eastern European nation reaches a free-trade agreement with the
European Union.  Sunflower-oil exports from Ukraine rose 13 percent from a
month earlier to 158,200 tons in June’s first 20 days, Kiev-
based researcher ProAgro said in an e-mailed statement late
yesterday. About 60 percent of shipments were bound for  India 
and the Netherlands, with other deliveries to nations including
Spain and  Turkey , it said.  Sunflower planting in Ukraine increased 6.7 percent from a
year earlier to 4.4 million hectares (10.9 million acres) as of
June 1, according to the national statistics office.
Ukroliyaprom expects sunflower-seed production this year between
7 million and 7.2 million tons, “depending on weather,”
according to Kapshuk.  Rapeseed exports totaled 1.4 million tons in the first nine
months of the current marketing year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
