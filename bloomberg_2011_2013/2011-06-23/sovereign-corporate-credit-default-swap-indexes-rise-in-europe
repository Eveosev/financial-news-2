The cost of insuring against default
on Portuguese sovereign debt surged to a record, driving a
benchmark gauge of credit-default swaps on the regionâ€™s
government debt to an all-time high.  Swaps on  Portugal  climbed 42 basis points to 824, and the
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of contracts on 15
governments jumped 16 basis points to 240 at 2:30 p.m. in
London. An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit
quality .  Swaps on  Greece  rose 63 basis points to 2,050, signaling an
83 percent chance of default within five years, according to
CMA. Ireland increased 40 to 795 and  Spain  rose 21.5 to 306.5,
while Italy was 10.5 higher at 199 and Belgium was up 15 at 167.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 12
basis points to 422, the highest since Jan. 11, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 3.75 basis points to 114 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 5.5 basis points to 168.5 and
the subordinated index climbed 7 to 297.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
