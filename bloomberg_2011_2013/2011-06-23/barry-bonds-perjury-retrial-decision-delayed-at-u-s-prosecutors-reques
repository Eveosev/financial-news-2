Any retrial of perjury charges
against  Barry Bonds , the Major League Baseball player convicted
in April of obstructing justice in a U.S. steroids probe, will
be delayed, a federal judge ruled today.  U.S District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco today
agreed with prosecutors that Bonds’s attempt to get his
conviction thrown out must be litigated before the government
has to decide whether to retry him on the perjury charges that
ended in a mistrial on April 13.  Lawyers for the all-time home run leader argued the
government faced a legal deadline to say whether he will be
retried on charges he lied about knowingly taking steroids,
using human growth hormone and receiving injections from his
trainer. The jury couldn’t reach a unanimous decision on those
counts. Bonds’s lawyers argued any retrial should start within
one month to comply with a federal law guaranteeing “speedy”
trials.  Illston scheduled the next hearing for Aug. 26.  Cris Arguedas, a lawyer representing Bonds, and Assistant
U.S. Attorney Matt Parrella declined to comment.  Bonds, 46, a former  San Francisco  Giants outfielder, was
indicted in November 2007. He was the first Major League
Baseball player to be charged in a years-long federal probe of
steroid use in professional sports. The maximum sentence for
obstruction of justice is 10 years in prison.  The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
