Jim Riggleman resigned as manager of
the  Washington  Nationals because the Major League Baseball club
wouldn’t address his 2012 option.  “I didn’t say pick up my option or else; I just wanted a
conversation,” Riggleman said in a televised interview after
Washington’s 1-0 home victory against Seattle yesterday.  When General Manager Mike Rizzo said he wouldn’t discuss
the issue, Riggleman said he told him, “I got to give it up
then. I’m obviously not the person you want to go down the road
with.”  Rizzo said he’d name an interim manager before tonight’s
road game against the  Chicago White Sox .  Riggleman, 58, stood down after the Nationals won for the
11th time in 12 games. He has a 662-824 record in 12 seasons as
a manager with the  San Diego Padres , Chicago Cubs,  Seattle
Mariners  and Nationals, and went 140-172 with Washington since
2009.  Riggleman was being paid $600,000 this season, the lowest
among the 30 major league managers, and his option was for
$600,000, the Washington Post said.  Yesterday’s victory improved the Nationals’ record this
season to 38-37. Washington has never finished a season with a
winning record since joining the National League in 2005.  “I’m disappointed by the timing. We’re playing so well,”
Rizzo told reporters. “Coming off a homestand, we should be
celebrating. I’m disappointed. This is a distraction.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
