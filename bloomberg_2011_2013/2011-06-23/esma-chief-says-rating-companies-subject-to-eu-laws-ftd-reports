European Securities and Markets
Authority Chief Steven Maijoor said U.S. credit-ratings
companies won’t get a license for the European Union unless they
abide by the bloc’s rules,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
citing an interview.  ESMA will become the EU’s single credit-ratings firm
regulator in July, the newspaper said. The U.S. and the EU are
currently in dispute over supervisory powers over  Standard &
Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, which share
95 percent of the market, according to FTD.  -- Editor: John Simpson  To contact the reporter on this story:
