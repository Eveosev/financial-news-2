Two cargoes of North Sea Forties
crude have been added to the loading schedule for July,
according to a revised shipping plan obtained by Bloomberg News.  The two shipments will be for loading July 26 to July 28
and July 29 to July 31, the plan showed.  A fourth cargo was deferred to July from June, according to
the plan. The cargo, originally planned for June 24 to June 26,
is now for loading on July 2 to July 4.  This will bring the total number of cargoes for July to 24,
compared with the original plan for 18. All shipments are
600,000 barrels each.  The daily exports for Forties in July will be 464,516
barrels a day, the highest in three month, compared with a
revised 400,000 barrels a day for June. Shipments for next month
are 17 percent less than a year earlier.  Forties is one of four North Sea crude grades used to price
Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than half of global oil. The
other blends are Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
