South African President  Jacob Zuma 
and his Congolese counterpart, Joseph Kabila, urged Madagascar
to accept a regional proposal that would allow former
President  Marc Ravalomanana  to return from exile.  The two leaders said they “noted with regret” a statement
by Madagascar’s transitional government that rejected the
 Southern African Development Community ’s plan. The statement
came after a five-day meeting of the Democratic Republic of
Congo-Republic of South Africa Bi-national Commission in
Lubumbashi that ended on June 21.  Madagascar has been crippled by a political and economic
crisis since Andry Rajoelina, a former nightclub DJ, seized
presidential power in a March 2009 coup backed by the
military. After Rajoelina reneged on a power-sharing plan
mediated by the international community, SADC leaders unveiled
a “Roadmap out of the crisis” at a meeting in  South Africa 
earlier this month.  Madagascar was suspended from SADC following Rajoelina’s
coup. The 15-nation community says it will recognise Rajoelina
as president if political exiles including Ravalomanana are
allowed back “unconditionally.” Ravalomanana was blocked from
returning to the Indian Ocean island nation on a South African
airlines flight in February and has been given a lifetime
prison sentence in absentia.  While Rajoelina has said “legal matters” await
Ravalomanana’s return, Zuma and Kabila “strongly urged” his
government “to reconsider its decisions and abide by the
SADC Summit decision” in the interests of stabilizing the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
