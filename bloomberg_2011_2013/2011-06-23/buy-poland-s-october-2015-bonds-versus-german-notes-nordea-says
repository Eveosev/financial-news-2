Nordea AB recommends selling German
government notes due in 2015 and buying Polish bonds maturing in
the same year on the expectation that yields will converge as
 Poland  moves to adopt the euro in four or five years.  Investors should buy Poland’s bonds maturing in October
2015 versus German notes due in the same month for a return of
9.7 percent in one year, Aurelija Augulyte, a Nordea emerging-
market analyst in Copenhagen, wrote in a note to clients dated
today.  “The Polish sovereign yields have narrowed versus  Germany 
since the end of 2010 as we expected,” Nordea wrote, saying
that there is further room for convergence.  The yield on Poland’s 2015 bonds was little changed at
5.285 percent by 10:47 a.m. in Warsaw. The spread between the
Polish notes and the German ones was 329 basis points, or 3.29
percentage points, narrowing from 383 basis points in November.  “We strongly recommend not hedging the currency risks, as
it is one of the significant components in the expected return,
making Poland attractive versus other European sovereigns,”
Augulyte wrote.  The zloty weakened 0.3 percent against the euro to 3.9910,
extending its losses this year to 0.7 percent. Markets are
closed for a holiday in the eastern European country today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
