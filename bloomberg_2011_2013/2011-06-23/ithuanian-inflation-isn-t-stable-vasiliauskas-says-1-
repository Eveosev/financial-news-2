Lithuanian inflation “isn’t stable”
and consumer prices will probably rise 0.2 percent in June,
central bank Governor Vitas Vasiliauskas said.  While the Baltic nation meets the inflation target for euro
adoption, “our position on the inflation front isn’t stable,”
Vasiliauskas told parliament in Vilnius today.  Lithuania, which in 2006 became the only nation rejected
for euro adoption, risks missing its goal of joining the single
currency in 2014 as rising commodity prices fuel inflation.
Consumer-price growth accelerated to 5 percent last month, the
highest in two years.  Vasiliauskas said rising wages and strengthening domestic
demand may become “an unsafe price accelerator” as global
commodity prices rise. Further fiscal consolidation is
“inevitable” to contain price-growth, he said.  Inflation will probably exceed the level necessary for euro
adoption for the next two years and represents the biggest risk
to joining the currency, Vasiliauskas said June 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
