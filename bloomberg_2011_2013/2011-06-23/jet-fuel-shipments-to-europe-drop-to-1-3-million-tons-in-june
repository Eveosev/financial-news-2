European jet fuel imports are poised
to decrease in June at a time when summer vacations typically
boost demand for  aviation fuel .  About 1.3 million metric tons of jet fuel were shipped or
provisionally booked to sail to the continent from the  Middle
East  or  India  this month, compared with 1.6 million tons in May,
according to reports from four shipbrokers including Delhi-based
Interocean Shipping.  “Airlines are reporting a decline in load factors this
year as higher fares impact demand for leisure and economy-class
travel,” New York-based analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said
in a June 3 report, referring to seat-occupancy levels.  Stockpiles of the product in independent storage at
Europe’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub fell to the lowest
in more than two years last week, according to Netherlands-based
researcher PJK International BV.  Inventories declined 16 percent to 419,000 tons in the week
to June 16, the least since Aug. 21, 2008, when stockpiles were
at 393,000 tons, PJK data showed.  Prices of jet fuel cargoes in Northwest  Europe  have
averaged $90 a ton premium to gasoil on London’s ICE exchange
since March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s 82
percent more than a year earlier. The difference was $92 a ton
yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  The following table list a selection of ships scheduled or
provisionally booked in June to carry jet fuel to Europe from
the Middle East or India, according to shipbroker reports:  To contact the reporter on this story:
