Jordan’s public debt climbed 5.8
percent in April from the end of last year to 12.1 billion
dinars ($17 billion), the  Finance Ministry  said.  External and internal debt rose by 664.6 million dinars
from 11.5 billion dinars at the end of December, the Amman-based
ministry said in a statement on its  website . External debt
amounted to 4.63 billion dinars at the end of April and internal
debt was 7.5 billion dinars, it said.  Total debt represents 58 percent of the kingdom’s gross
domestic product, Al Arab Al Yawm newspaper said today.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports more than 90 percent of its oil and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current-account
deficits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
