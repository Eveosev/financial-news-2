Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko replaced Pyotr Prokopovich as head of the nation’s
central bank with his deputy, Yury Alymov, the state-run  Belta 
news service reported.  “He made mistakes, the government made mistakes too, and I
must face this,” Lukashenko said today, according to Belta.
Prokopovich will continue to serve the former Soviet country
after his health improves, the president said.  Lukashenko appointed Alymov acting chairman of the central
bank on June 20, Interfax reported, citing the president’s press
service. Alymov, a first deputy chairman at the central bank,
took over from Prokopovich because the chairman went on medical
leave for several months after recently having heart surgery,
Interfax said.  Belarus was forced to devalue its currency by 36 percent in
May and is seeking loans from  Russia  and the  International
Monetary Fund  as it struggles to close a current-account gap
equal to 16 percent of gross domestic product last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
