Gasoil futures in  London  dropped to
a four-month low, tracking crude, after the  International Energy
Agency  said members would release oil from reserves. Gasoline
barges also fell. Jet fuel stockpiles in independent storage in
northwest Europe declined to the lowest level since August 2008.  Light Products  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area traded at
as little as $949 a metric ton, according to a survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and Platts
pricing window. That’s a $28 drop from yesterday’s lowest price
for Eurobob, to which ethanol is added before being sold to
drivers. Those prices are for so-called barge lots of about
1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for July delivery dropped as much as $54.75, or 5.9
percent, to $871.75 a ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in
London. That’s the lowest level since Feb. 21. The contract was
at $885 a ton as of 5:04 p.m. local time.  Gasoil cracks rebounded from the lowest level in a week.  The front-month gasoil crack, a measure of profitability
for refiners, was at $11.84 a barrel as of 4:30 p.m. London
time, according to Bloomberg data. That’s up from $11.52 a
barrel at the same time yesterday, when it posted its first drop
this month to less than $12.  Heating oil barges traded at discounts of $1 to $3 to the
July ICE contract, the Platts survey showed. That’s little
changed on yesterday.  Jet fuel stockpiles in independent storage in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp fell to the lowest level since August 2008,
PJK International BV said. Inventories decreased 6.7 percent to
391,000 tons in the week to today, according to PJK, a research
company based in the Netherlands.  European jet fuel imports are poised to decline this month.
About 1.3 million tons were shipped or provisionally booked to
sail to the continent from the  Middle East  or  India  this month,
compared with 1.6 million tons in May, according to reports from
four shipbrokers including Delhi-based Interocean Shipping.  Diesel barges traded at a $27.50 premium to July futures,
the survey showed. That’s up from yesterday’s trading range of
$25 to $26.  Residues  Low sulfur fuel oil, used to power ships and generate
electricity, traded from $647 to $651 a ton, the survey showed.
