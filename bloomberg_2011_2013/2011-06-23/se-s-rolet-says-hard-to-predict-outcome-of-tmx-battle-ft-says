London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE) 
Chief Executive Officer Xavier Rolet said it’s “really
difficult” for anyone to predict who will win the battle to buy
Canada’s  TMX Group Inc. (X) , as it is “one of the most complex
deals” in the current spate of bourse mergers, the Financial
Times reported, citing a telephone interview with Rolet.  “Everything is coming through at the same time,” Rolet
said, according to the FT. “It’s really difficult for observers
to point to a single source of momentum,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
