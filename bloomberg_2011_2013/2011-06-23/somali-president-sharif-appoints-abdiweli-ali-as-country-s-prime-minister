Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed appointed Abdiweli Mohamed Ali as the country’s new
prime minister.  The appointment of Ali, the former deputy prime minister
and minister of planning and international cooperation, was
announced at a ceremony today in the presidential palace in
Mogadishu, the capital.  The previous prime minister, Mohamed Abdulahi Mohamed,
resigned on June 19 as part of an agreement reached 10 days
earlier in which the president and the parliamentary speaker,
Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan, deferred elections in the war-torn
country for 12 months. The accord called for the appointment of
a new prime minister within 30 days.  The deal followed months of dispute between Somalia’s
executive and legislative branches over when their terms should
end and the date for elections.  Parliamentary speaker Adan welcomed today’s appointment.  “We hope that the new prime minister will improve the
situation,” he said at the ceremony. “I hope we can cooperate
with him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
