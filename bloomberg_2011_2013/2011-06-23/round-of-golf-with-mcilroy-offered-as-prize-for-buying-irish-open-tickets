A ticket to next month’s Irish Open
not only will let golf fans see  Rory McIlroy . It will also lead
to one lucky fan playing alongside the  U.S. Open  champion.  Ticket purchasers for the July 28-31 golf tournament at
Killarney Golf and Fishing Club will be entered into a
competition offering a place on the 22-year-old’s team in the
tournament’s pro-am.  “Hopefully people will like the idea of taking me on,”
McIlroy said in a  statement  from the European Tour. “I might
even give them a couple of shots.”  McIlroy won last weekend’s U.S. Open by eight strokes for
his first major title. His score of 16-under-par was the lowest
in the tournament’s 111-year history, one of 12 U.S. Open
records set by the Northern Irishman.  McIlroy’s victory at Congressional Country Club in
Bethesda,  Maryland , moved him up to fourth in the Official World
Golf Ranking. He said he’s looking forward to playing in his
national championship.  “The Irish Open is very high on the list of tournaments
that I would like to win in my career one day,” McIlroy said.
“To win in front of a home crowd is something we don’t get the
chance to do that often, so I’d love to win the title.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
