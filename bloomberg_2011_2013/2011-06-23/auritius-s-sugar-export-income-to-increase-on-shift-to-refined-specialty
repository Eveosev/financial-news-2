Mauritius estimates that income from
sugar exports will rise 4.2 percent this year as the industry
shifts to producing refined and specialty sugars, according to
the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate.  Revenue will probably increase to 6.44 billion rupees ($226
million), Jean-Noel Humbert, the group’s chief executive
officer, said in an interview today in  Port Louis , the capital.
The forecast is based on preliminary estimates from the
syndicate, which is responsible for the Indian Ocean island
nation’s sugar exports and imports.  “For the first time since the Dutch introduced sugar in
1650, Mauritius will be exclusively producing value-added
sugars,” Humbert said. It isn’t viable to export raw sugar
anymore after the European Union, its main market, cut the
guaranteed price by 36 percent, he said.  Sugar production this year is estimated at 420,000 metric
tons, 7.2 percent lower than the previous year because of less
rain, the Mauritius Chamber of Agriculture said June 8. Sugar
cane is the country’s main crop, making up about 80 percent of
land under cultivation and 63 percent of agricultural exports,
according to the chamber.  Harel Freres Ltd. (HFRERES) ,  Omnicane Ltd. (MTMD)  and
Flacq United Estates Ltd. are the biggest sugar producers in
Mauritius. The country has a six-year contract to 2015 to sell
its refined white sugar to Sudzucker AG of  Germany .  Output is expected to be 70 percent refined white, known as
EEC Grade 2, and 30 percent a range of 15 varieties of specialty
sugars, Humbert said.  Mauritius produced 256,267 tons of refined white sugar last
year, 110,000 tons of specialty sugars, including demerara and
muscovado, and 81,450 tons of raw sugar. Mauritius is the
largest producer of specialty sugars in the world, according to
Humbert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
