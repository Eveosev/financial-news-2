Zimbabwe  has “no choice” but to
accept the supervision of diamond exports from the southern
African nation, Mines Minister  Obert Mpofu  said.  A decision to allow Zimbabwe to export diamonds under
certain conditions by the  Kimberley Process , set up to end the
trade in gems mined to fund conflict, was a “compromise
outcome,” he said today in an interview in Kinshasa, the
capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
