Zinc production in  Japan  will slump
by at least 9 percent this year after the March earthquake,
doubling imports to the highest level in 11 years, said the
country’s top producer of the metal used to galvanize steel.  The world’s third-biggest economy will likely produce about
542,000 metric tons, down from an estimate of 597,000 tons
before the disaster, said Nobuyuki Nakamoto, general manager at
Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co.’s zinc business. The country may
import as much as 80,000 tons this year, the highest level since
2000, he said in an interview in Tokyo.  Surging imports may support global prices. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. recommended in May that investors buy the metal,
predicting demand will outpace supply next year. Zinc is the
second worst-performing metal on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Index of 24 raw materials this year, declining 10 percent as the
International Lead & Zinc Study Group forecasts a surplus.  “Output may fall below 540,000 tons as the latest estimate
doesn’t include any additional impact from blackouts in the
summer,” Nakamoto said on June 21. That would be the lowest
level since 1967, according to Japan Mining Industry Association
data. The country produced 574,000 tons last year, he said.  Zinc will average $2,475 a ton in 2011 and $2,500 in 2012,
said  Michael Widmer , head of metals research at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in London, who was the second-most accurate
forecaster for the metal for the eight consecutive quarters
ended March 31, according to Bloomberg data. Three-month zinc
averaged $2,346 a ton this year on the London Metal Exchange and
traded at $2,238 a ton at 6:05 p.m. in Tokyo.  Future Deficit  “There is no acute shortage of refined zinc at the
moment,” Widmer said on June 20. “The base case remains for
mine supply growth to fade out over the next couple of years,
with deficits on the refined market possible from 2013.”  World supply will outpace demand this year by 161,000 tons
compared with a surplus of 264,000 tons last year, according to
the International Lead & Zinc Study Group. Last year was the
fourth consecutive annual surplus.  Zinc inventories in warehouses monitored by the  London 
Metal Exchange climbed to a 16-year high on June 15, led by
increases in Port Klang, Malaysia and  Chicago .  The country imported 988,000 tons of zinc concentrate last
year, buying 284,000 tons from  Peru , 250,000 tons from  Australia 
and 220,000 tons from Bolivia, according to the Japan Mining
Industry Association. The country has imported ore to make
refined zinc since 1951, according to the association.  Damaged Factories  Japan was  Asia ’s third-biggest zinc consumer after  China 
and  South Korea  in 2010, according to the International Lead &
Zinc Study Group. Demand was 516,000 tons last year, 4 percent
of the world’s total 12.6 million tons.  The temblor and tsunami on March 11 damaged factories,
including metal smelters and refineries, and knocked out  power
plants . Mitsui Mining restarted its Hachinohe zinc smelter in
Aomori prefecture, northern Japan, on June 10. Toho Zinc Co.
said June 3 that it resumed operations at its Onahama plant.  Consumption in Japan may decline to 516,000 tons from an
earlier estimate of 526,000 tons before the disaster, Nakamoto
said. Automakers, which halted production in March, will likely
increase output later this year after resuming full operations
this month, he said.  “If reconstruction begins later this year after removing
debris completely in the tsunami-hit regions, we may see an
increase in demand above the estimate,” he said.  Japan’s imports are projected to jump to 70,000 tons to
80,000 tons this year, after a record monthly import of 31,000
tons in April, while exports may decline to 77,000 tons from an
earlier estimate of 90,000 tons, Nakamoto said. In 2010, Japan
imported 31,856 tons, while exporting 97,745 tons.  “If this year’s imports climb above exports, it would be
the first time Japan will be a net importer since 2000,” he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
