India ’s rupee weakened for a second
day as international investors pared holdings of the nation’s
assets on concern global economic growth is faltering.  The U.S. Federal Reserve cut yesterday its forecast for
this year’s growth in the world’s biggest economy to as much as
2.9 percent from an April outlook of up to 3.3 percent. Overseas
funds reduced investments in Indian stocks by $336 million this
month, after pulling out $1.16 billion in May, exchange data
show.  “The U.S. growth outlook doesn’t look too bright and
that’s going to be a negative for financial markets,” said
Vikas Babu, a Mumbai-based currency trader at  Andhra Bank . “The
dollar looks stronger; we may see the rupee in a narrow range
for now.”  The Indian currency lost 0.1 percent to 44.96 per dollar at
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That increased its losses this quarter to 0.8 percent,
the worst performance after the  Thai baht  among  Asia ’s 10 most-
used exchange rates.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, gained 0.8
percent today to 75.11, the biggest advance in a week.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.56 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 45.49 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
