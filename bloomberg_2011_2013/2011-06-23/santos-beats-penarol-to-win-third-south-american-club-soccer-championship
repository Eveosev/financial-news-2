Neymar and Danilo scored second-half
goals as Santos beat Penarol 2-1 to secure its third Copa
Libertadores soccer title.  The home win at the Pacaembu stadium in  Sao Paulo  last
night gave  Brazil ’s Santos a 2-1 victory in the two-game final
following last week’s 0-0 draw in Montevideo.  It’s Santos’s first championship in South America’s premier
club competition since Pele led the team to to back-to-back
triumphs in 1962 and 1963. Uruguay’s Penarol was trying to win
its sixth title and first in 24 years.  Santos’s celebrations were marred by a brawl at the end of
the match. Pictures broadcast by Setanta Sports showed players
from both teams trading punches and kicks until police
intervened.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
