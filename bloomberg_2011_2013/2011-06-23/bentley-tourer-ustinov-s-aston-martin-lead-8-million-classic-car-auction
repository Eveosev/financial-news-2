An  Aston Martin  formerly owned by
the actor Peter Ustinov and a Bentley Speed Six Tourer were
among the top lots of a car auction last night as collectors
bought British classics.  The vehicles were two of 57 being offered by  RM Auctions  at
 Syon House  in west  London . The Canadian-based company sold 44 of
its lots for 5 million pounds ($8 million) including fees,
against a presale estimate of about 5 million pounds at hammer
prices.  Exceptional cars are in demand from wealthy investors, with
Aston Martin among the desirable marques. The Dukeand Duchess of Cambridge’s drive in an DB6 at the royal wedding in April
heightened awareness of the maker, seen by some buyers as the
British equivalent of Ferrari. Even with the James Bond
association, Astons have been undervalued, dealers said.  “At least two billionaires have been buying Aston Martins
aggressively over the last three or four years,” said Dietrich Hatlapa, founder of Historic Automobile Group International
( HAGI ), a London-based research company.  The Ustinov DB4 Vantage Convertible, dating from 1961, sold
for 431,200 pounds. The left-hand drive model had been bought
new by Ustinov and had been entered fresh to the market by its
Swiss owner with an estimate of 250,000 pounds to 320,000
pounds. Finished in its original Royal Claret, it attracted five
bidders before selling to an undisclosed buyer.  Le Mans Tourer  The top price of the evening was 470,400 pounds, for a 1929
Bentley Speed Six “Le Mans’’ Tourer, recreated in the 1970s
using an original chassis. It was estimated to sell for between
450,000 pounds and 550,000 pounds and attracted three bidders.  A 1926 Rolls-Royce Phantom I Experimental Sports Tourer
sold to a Japanese client for 392,000 pounds. The price was
below the minimum valuation of 400,000 pounds, reflecting the
thinner buyer base for pre-World War II models.  RM was holding its first sale to coincide with the Salon
Prive and its Concours d’Elegance.  This three-day event, now in its sixth year, saw owners
competing against each other in a series of beauty contests for
various classes of classic cars and motorcycles. The lovingly
presented autos were displayed on the lawns surrounding the Duke
of Northumberland’s Middlesex home.  Among the vehicles attracting admiring glances were a
futuristic 1934 Dymaxion three-wheeler belonging to the
architect  Norman Foster  and a 1939  Alfa Romeo  6c 2500 S
Berlinetta that Italian dictator  Benito Mussolini  gave to his
mistress, Claretta Petacci.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
