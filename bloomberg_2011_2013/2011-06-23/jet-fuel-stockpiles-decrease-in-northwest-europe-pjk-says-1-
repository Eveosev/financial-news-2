Jet fuel stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, fell for a second week to the lowest level since mid-August
2008, according to PJK International BV.  Jet fuel inventories decreased 6.7 percent to 391,000
metric tons in the week to today even as imports arrived from
the  Middle East , according to PJK, a research company based in
the Netherlands. That’s the lowest level since Aug. 14, 2008.  “Demand from the aviation sector is pulling product out of
storage,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by phone from
Oosterhout where the company is based. “Refinery returns are
not that supportive so refiners are cutting production and using
stocks as a supply source.”  Gasoil inventories declined 0.6 percent to 2.8 million tons
as cargoes were exported to the Suez and West Africa, according
to PJK. The fuel, which includes heating oil and diesel, was
shipped into the ARA-area from  Denmark  and the U.S.  Fuel oil  dropped 17 percent to 706,000 tons as cargoes were
exported to  Singapore , PJK data shows. That’s the lowest level
since May 12. Supplies arrived from Brazil,  France , Lithuania,
 Russia  and the U.K.  Naphtha stores fell 24 percent to 66,000 tons even as
product arrived from  Spain , the data shows.  Gasoline inventories rose 17 percent to 717,000 tons as the
fuel arrived from Denmark, France, Russia,  Sweden  and the U.K.,
according to PJK. That’s the highest level since May 5. Cargoes
were sent to Mexico and the U.S.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha, fuel oil and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
