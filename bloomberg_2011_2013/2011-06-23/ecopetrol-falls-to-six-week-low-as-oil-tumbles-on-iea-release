Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s largest oil
company, fell to its lowest level in more than six weeks as
crude tumbled to a four-month low after the  International Energy
Agency  said members would release emergency stockpiles from
strategic reserves.  Ecopetrol, the most weighted stock on Colombia’s Colcap
Index, where it accounts for 19 percent of the market, fell 1.3
percent to 3,755 pesos at 11:15 a.m. New York time, the lowest
on an intraday basis since May 9.  “Oil was falling since before the market opened,” said
Valeria Marconi, analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Correval SA.
“All external markets are weak and having an impact here.”  Global stocks slid the most in three months and the euro
weakened as U.S. jobless claims rose and European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said the debt crisis threatens
banks. The global slide pushed Colombian stocks down even after
the country’s foreign debt rating was increased to investment
grade by  Fitch Ratings  yesterday, said Carlos Eduardo Gonzalez,
head of research at brokerage Bolsa y Renta.  “Colombia is adjusting to what’s happening outside,” he
said in a phone interview from Medellin.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the Toronto-based oil
producer that operates fields in Colombia and is the third most-
weighted stock on the Colcap, fell 1.9 percent to 48,500, paring
its biggest three-day gain since April 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
