OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA,
the Brazilian oil company controlled by billionaire  Eike
Batista , fell in  New York  trading as oil slumped to a four-month
low after the  International Energy Agency  said its members would
release crude from strategic reserves.  OGX ADRs dropped 2.2 percent to $9 at 4 p.m. New York time.
Shares have lost 27 percent since the end of March. Oil for
August delivery dropped $3.51, or 3.7 percent, to $91.90 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its lowest price
since Feb. 18.  IEA members announced they will release 60 million barrels
of oil from emergency stockpiles to alleviate possible shortages
following the loss of Libyan crude. It’s the third time since
the IEA was founded in 1974 that the agency has coordinated the
use of emergency stockpiles. The first was during the 1991
Persian Gulf War. The second was following  Hurricane Katrina  in
2005.  “In the scheme of things, 60 million barrels is a drop in
the ocean, but psychologically it does matter because this isn’t
something that happens very often,” said  Anisa Redman , an oil
analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc in New York. “For OGX, it’s
collateral damage, like for many other oil and gas stocks.”  The world consumes about 85 million barrels a day, Redman
said. Redman rates OGX’s ADRs “overweight” with a 12-month
price target of $17.50 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
