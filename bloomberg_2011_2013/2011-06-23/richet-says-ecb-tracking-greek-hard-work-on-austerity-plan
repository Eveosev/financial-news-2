The  European Central Bank  is
following “very carefully” the “hard work” under way in
 Greece  to complete an austerity package necessary for the
country to qualify for further aid, central bank chief Jean- Claude Trichet said.  “We will follow very carefully what is being done,”
Trichet told reporters in Brussels late yesterday after a summit
meeting of European Union leaders. “It depends very, very much
on the finalization of the discussions that are taking place
right now.”  EU leaders had an “important discussion” about Greece at
the meeting, Trichet said. He assessed Greece’s efforts as
“professional” and “appropriate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
