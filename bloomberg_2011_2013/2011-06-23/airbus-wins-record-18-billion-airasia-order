Airbus SAS won 200 orders for its
A320neo jetliner from Malaysian discount carrier  AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) ,
the biggest deal in the European planemaker’s history by
aircraft numbers with a value of $18 billion at list prices.  AirAsia becomes Airbus’s No. 1 airline customer in the
single-aisle market, with a total of 375 orders for A320-series
aircraft, including 89 already in service, the Toulouse, France-
based manufacturer said today at the  Paris Air Show .  Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.,
plans to introduce the re-engined A320neo from late 2015,
promising efficiency gains of 15 percent versus existing narrow-
body planes. Chicago-based Boeing Co. has yet to decide whether
to upgrade its rival 737 aircraft or design a completely new jet.  “This landmark deal is the strongest endorsement yet of
our decision to invest in the development of the A320neo,”
Airbus Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders  said at a press
conference at the Paris show, adding that the neo has become “by
far” the fastest selling airliner in the history of aviation.  The AirAsia contract capped a record air show for Airbus,
which won 418 firm orders valued at $44 billion. The A320neo,
with a list price of $91.2 million, attracted 667 orders and
commitments worth almost $61 billion, taking the total since the
model’s December launch to 1,029.  CFM Victory  AirAsia chose the Leap-X engine from  CFM International , a
venture of  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA (SAF) , to power the
planes. Two engines go on each aircraft, giving the order a
value of about $4.8 billion based on list prices.  The Leap-X competes with the geared turbofan from  United
Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt & Whitney unit.  For AirAsia, the deal “has secured its future with the
ability to meet the huge growth potential offered by the Asian
market,” Tony Fernandes, the carrier’s CEO, said at the briefing.  With its main hub in Sepang, outside Kuala Lumpur, AirAsia
flies to more than 20 countries and has affiliates in Thailand
and  Indonesia , according to its website, while the AirAsia X
division offers long-haul services.  “I don’t think it’s aggressive,” Angeline Chin, an
analyst at Kuala Lumpur-based TA Securities Holdings Bhd. said
in a telephone interview ahead of the announcement. “If the
company believes that it can grow further, why not?”  AirAsia stock closed unchanged at 3.16 ringgit in  Kuala
Lumpur  before the order announcement. It has risen 25 percent
this year, valuing the company at 8.77 billion ringgit ($2.89
billion) and outpacing the 2.9 percent gain in Malaysia’s
benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index.  EADS rose as much as 2.4 percent to 22.38 euros and was
trading little changed at 21.83 euros as of 3 p.m. in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
