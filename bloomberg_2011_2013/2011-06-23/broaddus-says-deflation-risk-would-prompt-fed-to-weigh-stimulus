Former Federal Reserve Bank of
Richmond President Alfred Broaddus said disinflation and an
increase in the risk of deflation would prompt the central bank
to consider another round of asset purchases.  “Clearly if you began to see a reversal of the recent run-
up in inflation and maybe some deterioration in inflation
expectations,” then “the Fed would have to pay attention to
that,” Broaddus said today in an interview with  Tom Keene  on
Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance Midday.” “That’s what
would be required for the Fed to seriously consider” buying
more bonds.  Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday left the door open to
additional monetary easing should the economic rebound he’s
predicting fail to materialize. He said the Fed would be
“prepared to take additional action, obviously, if conditions
warranted,” while adding the risk of deflation had waned since
the central bank embarked on its second round of bond purchases
in November.  The Fed’s latest round of so-called quantitative easing was
dubbed “QE2” by analysts and investors.  “He said flatly that, in contrast to the period there at
the beginning of QE2 in the fall, he sees no deflation now,”
Broaddus said. “I don’t think he himself expects QE3.”  The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee yesterday
agreed to complete $600 billion in bond purchases as scheduled
this month and affirmed their pledge to maintain record monetary
stimulus to spur the slowing economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
