Celesio AG (CLS1) â€™s new Chief Executive
Officer Markus Pinger is considering the examples of Alliance
Boots Holdings Ltd. and  McKesson Corp. (MCK)  to decide which strategy
to follow, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing an
interview.  McKesson is an example of how to increase business with
hospitals and pharmacies by expanding the scale of services
offered, the CEO said, according to the newspaper. Studying
Alliance Boots could help him decide whether Celesio should
expand its retail activities, FTD said. McKesson assumed his
post today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
