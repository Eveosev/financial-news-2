The International Monetary Fund’s
mission chief to  Greece  is in Athens today to meet with the new
finance minister and discuss where the government stands on the
economic measures attached to an international bailout, an IMF
spokesman said.  IMF’s Poul Thomsen and his counterparts from the European
Commission and the  European Central Bank  are in Athens “to take
stock of developments and the government’s current take on the
program,” David Hawley told reporters in Washington today.  Hawley said there is no date yet for an IMF board meeting
to authorize the disbursement of a new tranche under the IMF
share of the international loan.  Asked what it takes for the board to approve it, he said
that “the board has to be satisfied that the program is on
track and that it is adequately financed,” a condition that
applies to all loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
