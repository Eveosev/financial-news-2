Asian stocks fell, driving the
region’s key index lower for the first day in three, after the
U.S. Federal Reserve lowered its growth forecast for the world’s
biggest economy and amid concern  China  will raise  interest rates .  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a maker of mobile phones and solar panels
that gets more than 20 percent of its sales in the U.S., slid
1.7 percent in  Tokyo .  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , which gets 30 percent
of its revenue in  North America , fell 0.6 percent in Seoul.
Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. lost 1.7 percent in  Hong Kong  after
the China Securities Journal said the government should raise
interest rates.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining
company, sank 1 percent as oil and copper prices fell.  “The Fed’s new forecasts do not have shock value in
undercutting the broader consensus, but do confirm a more tepid
recovery which may disappoint some pundits,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1 billion in global equities
at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 0.9 percent to 130.73 as
of 7:31 p.m. in Tokyo, set for the steepest daily drop in a week.
About twice as many stocks declined as advanced on the gauge,
which has dropped for the past seven weeks. The index has
tumbled 7.1 percent from this year’s May 2 high amid mounting
concern about a slowing U.S. economy,  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis and China’s steps to curb inflation.  Kospi, Nikkei Drop  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 0.7 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index slid 0.4 percent. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock
Average dropped 0.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid
0.5 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.5
percent today. The index lost 0.7 percent to 1,287.14 yesterday
in  New York .  LG Electronics slipped 0.6 percent to 80,900 won in Seoul.
Kyocera retreated 1.7 percent to 8,140 yen in Tokyo.  James
Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , an Australian building materials company
that gets more than 70 percent of its sales from the U.S.,
dropped 0.7 percent to A$5.35 in Sydney.  Nikon Corp., a camera maker that counts North America as
its biggest market, retreated 4.9 percent to 1,926 yen. Fujifilm
Holdings Corp. dropped 2.2 percent to 2,388 yen after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. removed the maker of copy machines and printers
from its “conviction buy” list, citing a weakening outlook for
sales of  office equipment .  Fed Forecasts  Fed officials lowered their forecasts for U.S. growth and
employment this year and next, projecting the economy will
expand by between 2.7 percent and 2.9 percent this year, down
from forecasts ranging from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent in April.
Inflation, excluding food and energy, will be somewhat higher
than previously forecast, policymakers said. They said the pace
of recovery is likely to “pick up over coming quarters.”  “The economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace,
though somewhat more slowly than the committee had expected,”
the Federal Open Market Committee said yesterday in a statement.
“The committee will complete its purchases of $600 billion of
longer-term Treasury securities by the end of this month and
will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal
payments from its securities holdings.”  “Even though Bernanke agrees the economy has hit a soft
patch and should reaccelerate, the Fed did cut its forecasts for
growth in both 2011 and 2012,” said James Holt, Sydney-based
director of BlackRock Investment Management (Australia) Ltd.,
which oversees about $40 billion in assets. “This took the wind
out of the sail of the recent rally.”  Biggest Drop  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 4.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 2.3 percent by the
S&P 500 and a drop of 3 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.4 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13 times for the S&P 500 and
10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  All 10 industry groups on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
declined today. BHP Billiton lost 1 percent to A$42.04 in Sydney.
 Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas
producer, slid 1.7 percent to A$40.40. PetroChina Co., Asia’s
largest oil and gas producer by market value, fell 1.3 percent
to HK$10.90 in Hong Kong.  Crude oil for August delivery fell as much as 1.8 percent
in New York today. Copper for delivery in three months dropped
0.7 percent in  London  yesterday.  Belle, New World  Aluminum Corp. lost 1.7 percent to HK$6.25 and  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., Asia’s largest bank by market
capital, declined 1.4 percent to HK$5.72.  Belle International
Holdings Ltd. (1880) , a women’s footwear retailer in China, dropped 2.4
percent to HK$15.30.  New World Department Store China, a department-store
operator that receives all its revenue from China, declined 1
percent to HK$5.96.  The China Securities Journal said in a front-page editorial
the country’s central bank should boost real interest rates, a
move that would cool the nation’s lending market.  “People are looking for where they can put their bets for
the second-half and there doesn’t seem to be many choices,”
said Pearlyn Wong, an investment analyst in Singapore at Bank
Julius Baer & Co., which manages about $205 billion in client
assets globally.  Kangwon Land Inc. (035250) , which runs the only South Korean casino
open to locals, lost 3.7 percent to 27,450 won in Seoul. The
tourism ministry may seek to allow Koreans into gambling venues
previously open only to foreigners, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper
reported. The tourism ministry’s public relations team declined
to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
