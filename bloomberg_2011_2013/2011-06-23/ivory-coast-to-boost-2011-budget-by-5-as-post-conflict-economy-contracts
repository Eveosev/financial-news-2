Ivory Coast’s  government approved a
3.05 trillion CFA franc ($6.6 billion) budget for 2011, a 5
percent increase from a year earlier even as the strife-hit
economy contracts, said government spokesman Bruno Kone.  The economy of the world’s top cocoa grower will shrink by
6.3 percent in the year following a 4 1/2-month post-election
crisis that shuttered financial institutions and halted cocoa
and coffee exports. Growth in 2010 was 2.7 percent, Kone said in
a statement on state television yesterday.  The spending plan is the first for President Alassane Ouattara, the winner of a November election that saw ex-leader
Laurent Gbagbo refuse to cede power. As many as 3,000 people
were killed, according to the  International Criminal Court ,
which may investigate alleged war crimes committed by supporters
of both men, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  Ivory Coast expects to earn 224 billion CFA francs from
crude oil and natural gas and 437 billion CFA francs from debt
restructuring and budget support from the  World Bank , the
 International Monetary Fund , the  African Development Bank , the
French Development Agency and the West African Monetary Union,
Kone said.  The government will spend on servicing debt and state
employees’ wages, he said, without giving figures. As much as
840 billion CFA francs will be spent on rural development
including electricity and education, Kone said. Another 340
billion CFA francs will go toward investment expenses, he said,
without giving details.  Ivory Coast ’s defaulted 2.5 percent Eurobonds, due 2032,
declined for a second day, falling 1 percent to 52.875 cents on
the dollar. The yield rose to 12.985 percent by 5:22 p.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
