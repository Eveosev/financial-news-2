Two men were arrested on charges
they plotted to attack a U.S. military processing center in
 Seattle  using machine guns and grenades, prosecutors said.  Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, also known as Joseph Anthony Davis,
33, of Seattle, and Walli Mujahidh, also known as Frederick
Domingue Jr., 32, of  Los Angeles , were arrested last night and
charged with terrorism and firearms violations, U.S. Attorney
Jenny A. Durkan in Seattle said in an e-mailed statement.  Law enforcement officials had been monitoring Abdul-Latif
and Mujahidh after Seattle police got a tip from an informant
who was approached about participating in the attack and
supplying the men with firearms, according to the statement.  The two men, who face life in prison if convicted, are
scheduled to appear before U.S. District Judge Mary Alice Theiler in Seattle, according to the statement.  Electronic court files didn’t list lawyers for Abdul-Latif
and Mujahidh.  Emily Langlie, a spokeswoman for Durkan, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.  The case is U.S. v. Abdul-Latif, Mujahidh, 11-mj-00292,
U.S. District Court, Western District of  Washington  (Seattle).  To contact the reporter on this story:
