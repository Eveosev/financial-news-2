The shekel weakened the most in a
week as investors sought the relative safety of the dollar amid
concern  Greece  may not receive the financial aid needed to avert
default.  The shekel weakened as much as 1.6 percent against the
dollar, and was 1.2 percent lower at 3.4542 at 5:18 p.m. in Tel
Aviv. The dollar climbed against 15 of its 16 major peers after
the  Federal Reserve  damped speculation of additional stimulus at
a policy meeting yesterday. European leaders begin a two-day
summit in Brussels today to discuss Greece’s financing needs.  “There is no risk appetite in the market,” Adiv Kabiri,
senior currency dealer at Gift Asset Management Ltd. in Tel
Aviv, said by telephone. “Investors are turning to the  U.S.
dollar  as there is again uncertainty about the recovery of
Greece.”  Israel ’s 10-year bonds rose as signs of slowing U.S. growth
and the debt crisis in Europe increased demand for the relative
safety of government debt. U.S. initial jobless claims climbed
last week more than economists forecast and European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said the sovereign-debt
crisis threatens to infect banks.  The yield on the 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.1
percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  “A decline in global stocks is bolstering demand for
safety,” Kabiri said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slumped for a second day,
retreating 1.6 percent. Israel’s benchmark TA-25 Index dropped
1.7 percent, the most since June 15, to 1,211.08 in  Tel Aviv .  To contact the reporter on this story:
