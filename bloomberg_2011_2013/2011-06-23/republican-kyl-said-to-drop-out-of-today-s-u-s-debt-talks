Senator  Jon Kyl  of Arizona, the No.
2 Republican leader, is withdrawing from today’s deficit-
reduction talks with Vice President Joe Biden, one of his aides
said, a decision that means the only two Republican party
participants won’t attend.  House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor , a Virginia Republican,
said earlier he is boycotting today’s session.  Six lawmakers -- four Democrats along with Kyl and Cantor -
- were appointed by congressional leaders to work with Biden on
a plan to cut record-high deficits and debt. Republican leaders
are demanding such a plan in exchange for enough votes to raise
the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling later this summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
