Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (SBLK) , a
commodity shipping company, said it leased a vessel to Cargill
Inc., which trades almost one-fifth of all dry-bulk shipping
derivatives, for at least two years.  The Star Gamma was booked by Cargill at a rate of $14,050 a
day with an option for a third yearâ€™s rental at $15,500, Athens-
based Star Bulk said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Star Gamma is a supramax vessel, a type of ship which
usually carries coal,  iron ore  and grains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
