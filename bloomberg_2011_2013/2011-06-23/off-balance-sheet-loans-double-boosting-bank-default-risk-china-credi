Chinese banks helped arrange 320
billion yuan ($49.5 billion) of loans between companies in the
first quarter that weren’t recorded in the lenders’ balance
sheets, raising the risk on their bonds to a two-year high.  While global financial regulators are requiring more
transparency and the People’s Bank of  China  restricts credit to
cool inflation, lenders have increased the off-balance sheet
loans by 110 percent, central bank data show. Credit-default
swaps on Bank of China Ltd. are on course for their biggest
monthly rise since October 2008 and are the most expensive since
May 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The so-called entrusted loans are kept off balance sheets
because the bank acts as the middleman, with no direct credit
risk. The financial institution is still vulnerable should the
final borrower trigger a chain of defaults. Companies are
charging firms interest of as much as 21 percent, three times
higher than the benchmark one-year lending rate of 6.31 percent,
stock exchange filings show.  “Some of the borrowers with low  credit quality , which can
never or should never get bank credit, get levered through
entrusted loans, which increases the overall leverage of the
economy,” said Winnie Wu, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch in  Hong Kong . “If there is a credit downturn or liquidity
crunch those things could easily go bust, and the effect will
come back to haunt the banking system.”  More than 40 percent of borrowers on entrusted loan deals
announced since January 2010 have been property developers
facing lending curbs intended to control inflation, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch research. Local government
financing companies were the most active lenders. The banks
receive a fee for acting as an intermediary.  Bank Liabilities  Money market rates have surged as the PBOC raised benchmark
rates four times since September to 6.31 percent and ordered the
largest banks last week to set aside 21.5 percent of their
deposits as reserves. The seven-day repurchase rate, which
measures interbank funding availability, rose 23 basis points,
or 0.23 percentage point, to 9.04 percent yesterday, the highest
level since October 2007. New loans in the first five months,
excluding unofficial lending, totaled 3.55 trillion yuan, 12
percent lower than a year earlier, central bank data show.  Entrusted loans made up 7.9 percent of last year’s 14.27
trillion yuan of social financing, the term used for all funds
raised in the economy, central bank data show. That compares
with 0.9 percent in 2002.  Fitch Ratings  estimates disclosed off-balance sheet items
for 16 Chinese banks are about $3.5 trillion to $4 trillion, or
25 percent of total assets, including entrusted loans, credit
commitments, guarantees, letters of credit and acceptances.  ‘Credit Exposure’  “There has been a rise in off-balance sheet and other
hidden activity which is leading to understated credit growth
and credit exposure,” Charlene Chu, senior director of
financial institutions at Fitch in Beijing, said at a conference
in Singapore on June 21. “We foresee a fair amount of
contingent liabilities in the banking sector.”  Total credit in China, including non-bank lending, is at
worrying levels, according to Vincent Chan, the Hong Kong-based
head of China research at Credit Suisse Group AG. The amount of
loans reached 26.7 trillion yuan in 2009 to 2010, a 71 percent
increase from the end of 2008, he wrote in a June 20 report. The
ratio of credit to gross domestic product reached 166 percent in
March.  China’s banks could be saddled with more non-performing
loans as economic growth in the nation slows, according to
Credit Suisse, which cut its forecast for expansion in 2012 to
8.5 percent from 8.9 percent on June 20.  “The problem is if anything goes wrong, whether the banks
will get away unharmed,” Chan said. “In theory the banks have
no need to pay at all, but they end up paying a lot out of their
own pocket.”  Entrusted Loans  On April 30, Ningbo Bird Co., a maker of cellular phones,
said in a stock exchange filing it had lent 50 million yuan
through an entrusted loan at a rate of 18 percent to a property
company based in Huai’an city, Jiangsu province.  Sunny Loan Top Co. lent 55 million yuan to Nan Tong
Fragrant Cereals Food Processing Co. through a one-year
entrusted loan using  Bank of China  at 21.6 percent, the company
said in a June 7 stock exchange notice.  Default Swaps  Five-year credit-default swaps on Bank of China, the
nation’s third largest, surged 50 basis points this month to
171, the highest level since May 2009, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The average cost for 32 Asian banks, including  South
Korea ’s Kookmin Bank and  Japan ’s Nomura Holdings Inc., rose 15
basis points to 145.1 in the month. The 26 basis-point gap is
the widest since August. China’s sovereign bond risk climbed
three basis points to 91 yesterday. The default swaps protect
investors from losses when a company or government fails to pay
its debt. Traders use them to speculate on credit quality.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China (1398)  Asia Ltd.’s $500 million of 5.125
percent bonds due November 2020 instead of similar-maturity
Treasuries widened 26 basis points this month to a record 241
basis points yesterday, ING Groep NV prices show. Spreads on
Bank of China Hong Kong Ltd.’s $2.5 billion of 5.55 percent,
February 2020 bonds widened 32 basis points to 271, the highest
level since July 2010, according to ING prices.  The yield on China’s 2.77 percent May 2012 bond gained 57
basis points this month to 3.59 percent today, according to the
National Interbank Funding Center. The yuan weakened against the
 U.S. dollar  today, with indicative bid prices for the yuan at
6.4705 per dollar as of 9:33 a.m. in Shanghai versus 6.4677 the
previous trading day. It has risen 2.1 percent this year.  Losses on Loans  China’s banks already face the risk of losses on loans to
more than 10,000 investment companies set up by local
governments to get around regulations prohibiting direct
borrowing. As much as 30 percent of those loans are expected to
turn sour,  Standard & Poor’s  said last month. Moody’s Investors
Service estimates the total outstanding loans to local
government financing vehicles at about 10 trillion yuan.  China’s banking regulator required systemically important
banks to have a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 11.5 percent
by the end of 2013 in its own version of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision rules, it said May 3.  Bailout Costs  The total cost of bailing out the Chinese banking system
from 1998 to 2005 was about 5 trillion yuan, or 20 percent of
China’s GDP at the time, according to a June 3 Barclays Capital
report.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission  required  lenders in
January to transfer 1.66 trillion yuan of off-balance sheet
loans to trust firms back onto their books by the end of 2011 to
ensure financial safety. Banks make the so-called trust loans
using proceeds from the sale of wealth management products to
their individual and corporate customers.  “It’s important to have some policy to discipline banks’
behavior because so far for entrusted loans and trust loans
banks have no transaction cost,” Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s Wu said. “They don’t have much incentive to control the
risk or be more selective in managing the process.”  -- Henry Sanderson . With assistance from Katrina Nicholas in
