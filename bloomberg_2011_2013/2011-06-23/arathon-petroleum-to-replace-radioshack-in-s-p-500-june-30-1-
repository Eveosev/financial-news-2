Marathon Petroleum Corp. will
replace  RadioShack Corp. (RSH)  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
after the close of trading on June 30, S&P said in a statement.  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  is spinning off Marathon Petroleum in a
transaction expected to be completed after regular trading ends
on June 30, and “RadioShack’s $1.4 billion market
capitalization is more representative of the mid-cap market
space,”  S&P said. Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon Petroleum
refines and markets energy products. RadioShack fell 3.4 percent
to $12.75 in after-hours trading as of 5:43 p.m. in  New York .  RadioShack, AMC Networks Inc. and  Holly Corp. (HOC)  will join the
S&P MidCap 400 Index, S&P said, replacing  Harte-Hanks Inc. (HHS) , Boyd
Gaming and  Frontier Oil Corp. (FTO)  Harte-Hanks,  Boyd Gaming Corp. (BYD)  and
 Entropic Communications Inc. (ENTR)  will enter the S&P SmallCap 600
Index, while Hutchinson Technology,  StarTek Inc. (SRT)  and Holly will
leave that gauge. Those changes will also take place June 30.  Holly is aquiring Frontier Oil in a deal expected to be
completed on or about June 30, S&P said.  Companies in the  S&P 500  have an average market value of
$24.4 billion, while S&P MidCap 400 components have a mean $3
billion and S&P SmallCap 600 members average $876.1 million
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. S&P said that more than
$1.25 trillion is indexed to its gauges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
