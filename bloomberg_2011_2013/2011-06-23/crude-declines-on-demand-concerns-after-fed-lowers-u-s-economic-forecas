Oil declined for the first time in
four days in New York as investors speculated U.S. fuel demand
may weaken after the  Federal Reserve  lowered its economic growth
outlook for the world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures slipped as much as 4.5 percent after a report today
showed U.S. jobless claims rose last week. Fed officials
yesterday cut their forecasts for growth and employment this
year and next, and an Energy Department report showed U.S. oil
stockpiles fell less than forecast and inventories at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for the New York-traded West Texas
Intermediate grade, increased for the first time in four weeks.  “It’s been clear for the last few weeks that the economic
development in the U.S. will be slower than expected, so of
course that’s a problem for the oil market,” said  Sintje Diek ,
an analyst at  HSH Nordbank  in Hamburg. “For the second half of
the year I think  oil prices  will come down to more fundamentally
based levels of $100 for Brent.”  Oil for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
declined as much as $4.30 to $91.11 a barrel in electronic
trading and was at $91.28 at 1:44 p.m. London time. The contract
yesterday rose 1.3 percent to $95.41 and has gained 20 percent
in the past year.  Brent crude  for August delivery fell $4.40, or 3.9 percent,
to $109.81 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The contract yesterday climbed $3.26, or 2.9 percent,
to $114.21. It was the biggest gain since May 9. Prices have
risen 44 percent in the past year.  Jobless Claims Rise  Prices extended losses after the U.S. Labor Department said
applications for jobless benefits increased 9,000 in the week
ended June 18 to 429,000. The level of claims exceeded the
highest estimate in a Bloomberg News survey in which the median
projection called for 415,000 filings.  Brent, the European benchmark contract, traded at a premium
of $18.52 a barrel to U.S. futures today. The difference between
the front-month contracts increased by more than $2 a barrel to
$18.80 yesterday after the Energy Department said supplies
increased at Cushing.  “The Brent/WTI spread, however, should be able to narrow
over the next one to two months,” as Transcanada Corp. cuts
July volumes on its Keystone pipeline by almost 20 percent to
isolate problems that led to leakages in May, analysts at
Vienna-based JBC led by Johannes Benigni said today in a note.  Fed Forecasts  Fed governors and regional-bank presidents now say the  U.S.
economy  will expand by 2.7 to 2.9 percent this year, down from
April’s forecasts of 3.1 to 3.3 percent, based on the median
range of projections. Growth in 2012 will range from 3.3 percent
to 3.7 percent, compared with forecasts in April of 3.5 to 4.2
percent, the Fed said.  Central bankers raised their forecast range for the
 unemployment rate  to an average 8.6 percent to 8.9 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with projections of 8.4
percent to 8.7 percent in April.  U.S. crude stockpiles fell 1.71 million barrels to 363.8
million last week, according to the Energy Department report.
They were forecast to decline 1.83 million barrels, a Bloomberg
News survey of analysts showed. Supplies at Cushing climbed
273,000 barrels.  Distillate inventories, a category which includes heating
oil and diesel, rose 1.17 million barrels, compared with a
median forecast for a 550,000-barrel gain.  Gasoline Stockpiles Fall  Gasoline supplies unexpectedly slid 464,000 barrels to
214.6 million, the Energy Department report showed. They were
projected to increase by 1 million barrels, according to the
median estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The fundamental story across the board is of limited
growth,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity
Broking Services Pty in Sydney, who predicted prices will
average $100 a barrel this year. “We’ve got plenty of crude.
It’s got to be a geopolitical event” to push crude above $100 a
barrel again, he said.  Nymex crude may fall toward $75 a barrel for the first time
in nine months if it drops through support at the 200-day moving
average, according to technical analysis from Citi FX.  Oil is “consolidating” just above the average at the base
of a head-and-shoulders formation, said  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief
technical analyst at Citi FX, part of Citigroup Capital Markets
in  New York . A head-and-shoulders pattern and several days of
trading around the 200-day moving average preceded a sizeable
decline in May 2010, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
