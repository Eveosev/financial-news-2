The  International Energy Agency ’s
release of emergency oil stockpiles “doesn’t change anything”
for producing nations as more supplies will still be needed,
state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said.  The drop in crude prices since the IEA announcement shows
that speculators, who have been “heating up the market,” are
“running scared,” NNPC spokesman  Levi Ajuonuma  said in a
telephone interview today. “In the long term the IEA will still
need stockpiles, so there’s still a need for production.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries supports
any decision that brings stability to the oil market, he said.  The U.S. and 27 allies will release emergency oil
stockpiles through the  International Energy Agency  for only the
third time in more than three decades as the war in  Libya  chokes
global supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
