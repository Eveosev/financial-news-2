Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Thailand  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 4:30 p.m. close in Bangkok.  The SET Index fell 9.73, or 1 percent, to 1,014.13.  Nation Multimedia Group Pcl (NMG)  , a media company,
surged 24 percent to 12 baht, the largest jump since Dec. 3. The
company will reduce the par value of its stock to 1 baht a share
from 10 baht, it said in a regulatory filing. The cut will take
effect from June 27, the company said.  Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl (STA)  , Thailand’s biggest
publicly traded rubber producer, dropped 1.9 percent to 26.5
baht, the lowest since May 23. Rubber in Tokyo declined to the
lowest level in more than six weeks on concerns demand for the
commodity may weaken after the  Federal Reserve  lowered its
economic growth outlook for the U.S.  Total Access Communication Pcl (DTAC)  , the nation’s
second-biggest mobile phone company, lost 4.1 percent to 53.25
baht, the steepest decline since May 18. The Commerce Ministry
will complete an investigation into the shareholding structure
of Total Access by July 4, Banyong Limprayoonwong, director-
general of the ministry’s department of business development,
said yesterday. The ministry will seek details from Telenor ASA,
which has a stake in Total Access, and the company’s local
shareholders, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
