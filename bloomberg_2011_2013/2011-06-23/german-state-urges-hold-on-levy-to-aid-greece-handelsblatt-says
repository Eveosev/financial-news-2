Germany  should put off its bank levy
for three years to encourage lenders to agree voluntarily to
Greek debt cuts, Handelsblatt cited a state finance minister as
saying.  The bank levy, intended for bailing out banks in crisis,
may generate about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) a year, the
newspaper cited Hartmut Moellring, finance minister of  Lower
Saxony , as saying in an interview. Lifting it temporarily would
make it easier for banks to agree to reduce Greek debt, he said,
according to Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
