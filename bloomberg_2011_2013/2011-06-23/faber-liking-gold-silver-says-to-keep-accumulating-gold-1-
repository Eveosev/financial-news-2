Marc Faber , publisher of the Gloom,
Boom & Doom report, said he still favors gold and silver and
will keep accumulating gold, even as prices of the metals may
decline in the next three months.  “I still like gold and silver,” Faber said in a Bloomberg
Television interview from  Hong Kong . “They will go down in the
next three months or so, but I wouldn’t short them. And I keep
on accumulating gold.”  Gold advanced to a record last month and is heading for its
11th year of gains, the longest winning streak since at least
the 1920s. Surging bullion has lured investors, including hedge-
fund manager  John Paulson , as sovereign-debt woes, record-low
U.S. borrowing costs, currency debasement and inflation boost
the appeal of precious metals as a store of wealth.  Commodities dropped 0.8 percent today after the  Federal
Reserve  reduced its growth and employment forecasts for the
world’s biggest economy, worsening the outlook for demand. Gold
for immediate delivery fell 0.1 percent to $1,547.55 an ounce at
12:42 p.m. in Singapore, which compares with the record
$1,577.57 an ounce on May 2.  Cash silver has almost doubled in the past year while gold
advanced 25 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
