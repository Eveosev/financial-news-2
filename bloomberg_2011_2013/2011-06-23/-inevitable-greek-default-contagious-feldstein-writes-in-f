A Greek default is “inevitable,”
and “the only question is when it will occur,” given the
country’s debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio of more than 150
percent, Harvard University Professor  Martin Feldstein  writes in
the Financial Times.  “The current negotiations are really about postponing the
inevitable default,” Feldstein writes, adding that a default
now could trigger defaults by Portugal, Ireland and Spain.  The European Central Bank is “determined to avoid a
default at this time” in order to give negotiators time to find
a way to delay the contagion defaults “long enough for
creditors to withstand the writedowns of bond values if Greece,
Portugal and Ireland default simultaneously,” Feldstein writes.
