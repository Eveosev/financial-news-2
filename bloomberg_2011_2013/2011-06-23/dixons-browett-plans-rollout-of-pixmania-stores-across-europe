Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS) , Europe’s second-
largest electronics retailer, plans to open small stores in
shopping malls across Europe under the name of its online brand
Pixmania as consumers demand a more multi-channel approach.  “There’s potential for a very fast rollout” of the 900
square-feet (83.6 square-meter) stores, Chief Executive Officer
John Browett said at a press conference in London today. A
branch of the company’s Currys electronics chain in a U.K.
shopping street is typically about 2,500 square feet.  Dixons, the owner of the PC World chain, has been trialling
a smaller version of Pixmania and said sales-per-square-foot
have been encouraging as internet pricing proves popular with
customers. Pixmania already has 17 larger outlets in  Europe ,
though its main revenue comes from its  transactional website 
that delivers to 26 countries. Browett said he sees scope for
the outlets in hundreds of malls where the brand exists in
Europe, including the U.K.,  France , Italy,  Spain  and Belgium.  Pixmania’s new smaller stores, whose slogan is the “one-
stop shop for great deals,” will have a limited range of items
and will be serviced with daily deliveries from its Paris
warehouse so customers can order online and collect the
following day.  Multi-channel sales are growing faster than pure online
sales for Dixons. Multi-channel revenue climbed 13 percent in
the year ended April 30, while e-commerce sales declined 5
percent, the company said. Dixons today reported a full-year
loss after one-time charges of 309.4 million pounds ($496
million), including a writedown of the Pixmania business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
