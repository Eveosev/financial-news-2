OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s largest non-
state natural-gas producer, agreed to pay 6.7 billion rubles
($240 million) for four licenses in the Yamal region, a ministry
official said.  Russia’s subsoil agency, Rosnedra, will recommend that the
licenses go to Novatek after annulling a tender today, said a
Natural Resources Ministry official who declined to be
identified, citing confidentiality.  Novatek was the sole bidder for the licenses to the fields,
which hold about 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent resources,
Chief Financial Officer Mark Gyetvay told reporters in London
yesterday.  Novatek’s press service declined to comment today.  Novatek is developing the Yamal LNG project, which plans to
cool gas to liquid form for tanker transit starting from 2016,
with  Total SA. (FP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
