Carl Icahn ’s lawsuit seeking at
least $100 million from Texas hedge-fund promoter Geoffrey Raynor, his R2 Investments LDC and others was dismissed by a New
York state judge.  In the suit, filed in February 2010, Icahn said Raynor
interfered with a $2 billion bond offering by Icahn Enterprises
LP and other Icahn companies. Justice Eileen Bransten in
 Manhattan  today dismissed the case, which included claims of
tortious interference with contract, libel and abuse of process.  Raynor and Icahn formed a partnership in 2001 to acquire
debt securities issued by Federal Mogul Corp., which was in
bankruptcy at the time, Bransten said in her decision. After a
dispute over the right to purchase some Federal Mogul stock,
Raynor made a securities filing in January 2010 disclosing a
suit commenced the same day by Raynor-affiliated Nineteen
Eighty-Nine LLC seeking to impose a “constructive trust” on the
shares, Bransten said.  Icahn, 75, said the timing of the regulatory filing and
suit lowered demand for the bond offering. He sued Raynor, R2,
Nineteen Eighty-Nine and five other defendants.  Raynor and Icahn are embroiled in other suits in New York
state court over the  stock options  in Federal Mogul, an auto-
parts supplier, according to the decision.  A message left with Icahn’s secretary wasn’t immediately
returned. A message left with attorneys for Raynor also wasn’t
immediately returned.  The case is Icahn v. Raynor, 150040/2010, New York state
 Supreme Court  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
