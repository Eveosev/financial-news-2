German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
European leaders will make no “operative decisions” on a
possible second rescue package for  Greece  at a summit in
Brussels that begins today.  “Of course we will discuss Greece, but there won’t be any
operative decisions because the finance ministers have started a
process” that needs to be followed and which the leaders will
reaffirm, Merkel told reporters in Brussels before the talks.
“You can’t expect decisions on programs or something like that
today because there’s an important vote in Greece first.”  The Greek Finance Ministry said yesterday that its five-
year fiscal plan will be submitted to the plenum of the
parliament for discussion on June 27-28. The ministry said the
accompanying “implementation law” will be discussed at the
parliament’s standing committee. The bill must be voted on by
June 30, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
