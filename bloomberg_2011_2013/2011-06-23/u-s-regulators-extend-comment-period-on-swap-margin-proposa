U.S. banking regulators have
extended the comment period for a proposed Dodd-Frank Act rule
that would impose new capital and margin requirements in the
$601 trillion global swaps market.  The rule, aimed at reducing risk by setting capital and
margin standards for swap dealers and major swap participants,
will be open for public comment until July 11, regulators
including the Federal Reserve and  Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.  said today in a statement.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Citigroup
Inc. (C) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  executed 96
percent of the $321 trillion of over-the-counter derivatives
trades by the top 25 U.S. bank-holding companies as of March 31,
according to a June 17 report from the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
