The following is the text of
 Canada 's employment insurance report for April released
by Statistics Canada.  In April, 598,400 people received regular Employment
Insurance (EI) benefits, down by 6,500 (-1.1%) from March
and the seventh consecutive monthly decline.  The number of beneficiaries fell in six provinces, with
the fastest declines in British Columbia and Alberta.  Higher number of claims  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the
number of people who could become beneficiaries.  The number of initial and renewal claims increased 2.8%
in April to 234,000. This increase followed three months
of declines.  The largest advance in the number of claims occurred in
Prince Edward Island (+5.2%),  Alberta  (+4.6%), New
Brunswick (+4.1%) and British Columbia (+3.1%). At the
same time, the number of claims declined in Manitoba 
(-2.6%).  Faster declines in beneficiaries in British Columbia and
Alberta  The number of people receiving regular Employment
Insurance benefits declined in six provinces in April,
with the largest decreases in British Columbia and
Alberta.  In British Columbia, the number of beneficiaries fell
for the seventh consecutive month, down by 3.7% to 67,000
in April. In Alberta, the number also decreased for the
seventh consecutive month, falling by 3.7% to 37,600. In
Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of beneficiaries
declined 1.4% to 35,800.  At the same time, there were more people receiving
regular benefits in Prince Edward Island (+1.8%), Manitoba
(+1.5%),  New Brunswick  (+1.4%) and Ontario (+0.9%).  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  Employment Insurance data by sub-provincial region, sex
and age are not seasonally adjusted and are therefore
compared on a year-over-year basis.  Continued year-over-year declines in most large centres  Between April 2010 and April 2011, the number of people
receiving regular benefits at the national level fell by
97,500 (-12.8%). Declines occurred in 125 of the 143 large
centres (see map). Large centres are those with a
population of 10,000 or more.  The five large centres in Newfoundland and Labrador all
had fewer beneficiaries in April. The fastest decrease
occurred in St. John's, where the number fell 9.5% to
5,000. This was the 13th consecutive month with a year-
over-year decline.  The number of regular beneficiaries fell in 25 of 33
large centres in  Quebec  between April 2010 and April 2011,
with the fastest declines occurring in Saint-Georges, La
Tuque and Granby. Over the same period, there was a
notable increase in Sept-îƒŽles. In  Montreal , the number of
beneficiaries fell by 12.8% to 64,100, the largest year-
over-year decrease in over 12 months. In the census
metropolitan area of Quebec, the number of beneficiaries
declined by 14.7% to 11,000, the fourth consecutive year-
over-year decrease.  In Ontario, 38 of the 41 large centres posted a
decrease. The most notable declines were in Greater
Sudbury, Tillsonburg, Guelph, Thunder Bay and Belleville.
In Toronto, the number fell by 19.6% to 72,000. Toronto
has maintained a similar pace of decline over the last 11
months.  In Manitoba, the number of regular beneficiaries was
down or unchanged in all four large centres. The fastest
rate of decline occurred in Winnipeg, where the number
fell 21.3% to 6,700, the eighth consecutive monthly year-
over-year decrease.  In Saskatchewan, the number of beneficiaries fell in
seven of eight large centres. The fastest declines
occurred in Saskatoon and Regina. In Saskatoon, the number
declined 31.9% to 1,900, the largest of five consecutive
monthly year-over-year declines. In Regina, the number of
beneficiaries decreased 28.5% to 1,200.  In Alberta, all 12 large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in April compared with April 2010. The pace
of decline was above 35% in Grande Prairie, Wetaskiwin,
Camrose and Red Deer. In Calgary, the number fell 31.4% to
12,100, while in  Edmonton , it declined 20.0% to 12,700.
Both Calgary and Edmonton continued the year-over-year
downward trend in beneficiaries that began in April 2010.  In British Columbia, the number of beneficiaries fell
in 24 of 25 large centres in the 12 months to April. The
fastest declines were in Fort St. John, Prince George,
Kamloops, Quesnel and Dawson Creek. In  Vancouver , the
number of people receiving benefits fell 22.4% to 28,500.
In Victoria, the number of beneficiaries decreased 12.2%
to 3,500, similar to the pace of decline observed over the
previous 10 months.  Demographic groups  Between April 2010 and April 2011, the number of male
and female regular beneficiaries fell at a similar pace.  The number of male regular beneficiaries fell by 12.9%
(-64,500) to 435,800, continuing the trend in monthly year-
over-year declines which started in March 2010.  Among men, the fastest rates of decline occurred for
those aged 25 to 54 (-15.2%) and youths under 25 (-12.3%).
Men aged 55 and over also saw a decline in the number of
beneficiaries (-5.2%).  The number of women receiving regular benefits
decreased by 12.6% (-33,000) to 228,200 during this year-
long period. This was the largest of 11 consecutive
monthly year-over-year declines.  Among women, the number of beneficiaries decreased by
17.1% for youths under 25, and by 14.1% for women aged 25
to 54. The number of female beneficiaries aged 55 and over
fell 5.5%, the second consecutive monthly year-over-year
decline for that group.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  Each month,  Statistics Canada  provides analysis of the
current labour market situation, using Employment
Insurance (EI) statistics and other sources. Earlier this
month, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) provided a picture of
overall labour market conditions, including unemployment,
total employment and characteristics of those affected by
changes in the labour market.  In this release, Statistics Canada provides additional
sub-provincial detail through the EI statistics. Details
by industry will follow with data from the Survey of
Employment, Payrolls and Hours.  EI statistics are produced from an administrative data
source provided by Human Resources and Skills Development
Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be
affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or
administrative procedures. The number of regular
beneficiaries and the number of claims received for March
and April are preliminary. In this release, large centres
correspond to those with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all persons
who received EI benefits from April 10 to 16. This period
coincides with the reference week of the LFS.  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.  The change in the number of regular EI beneficiaries
reflects various situations, including people becoming
beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.
