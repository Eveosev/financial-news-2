The Midwest has the best chance of
heat next week before the odds shift west into the Rocky
Mountain states, according to  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Rogers’s 6- to 10-day outlook shows the entire U.S., with
the exception of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, with a chance
for warmer-than-normal weather. The most intense heat is
forecast for western Kansas and Oklahoma and the Texas
panhandle.  In his 11- to 15-day outlook, for July 3 to July 7, Rogers
shifts the most intense heat back into an area from southwestern
Montana to Utah.  “Model consensus has built for a burst of hotter
conditions for the Midwest in the 6-10,” Rogers, based in
Bethesda, Maryland, wrote in a note to clients today.  Natural-gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures. Commodity traders
watch precipitation forecasts for impact on planting and yields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
