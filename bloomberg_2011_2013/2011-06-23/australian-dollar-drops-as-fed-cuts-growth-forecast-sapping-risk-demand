The Australian dollar fell against
the greenback for a second day after the  Federal Reserve 
signaled it wouldn’t add to record stimulus even after growth
slowed, spurring declines in shares and higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie dropped after the Fed reiterated that it will
complete the second round of quantitative easing, or so-called
QE2, this month and maintain existing stimulus to support a
flagging recovery. New Zealand’s dollar dropped, after gaining
earlier when the government offered to buy thousands of homes
damaged by Christchurch’s earthquakes.  “Some in the market had expected the Fed to mention a QE3,
but it didn’t happen, pushing down stocks and causing the dollar
to be bought back,” said Nobuhiko Akai, senior manager of the
foreign-exchange trading department in Tokyo at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. “As commodities and stocks fall, the Aussie
seems to be becoming top-heavy.”  Australia ’s dollar fell 0.8 percent to $1.0486 at 12:15
p.m. in  New York  from $1.0575 yesterday. The Aussie dropped 0.6
percent to 84.36 yen from 84.90 yen. New Zealand’s dollar lost
0.5 percent to 81.03 U.S. cents from 81.46 cents, and it
weakened to 65.19 yen from 65.41 yen.  Fed governors and regional-bank presidents now say the  U.S.
economy  will expand by a range of 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent
this year, down from April’s forecasts of 3.1 percent to 3.3
percent, based on the median range of projections.  New Zealand’s government offered to buy about 5,000 quake-
damaged homes in Christchurch as part of a recovery package that
will see parts of the South Island city’s eastern suburbs
disappear.  To contact the reporter on this story:
