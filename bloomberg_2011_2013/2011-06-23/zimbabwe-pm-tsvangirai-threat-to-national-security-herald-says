Senior Zimbabwean military officials
regard Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai  as a threat to the
nation’s national security, the state-controlled  Herald 
reported, citing Brigadier General Douglas Nyikayaramba.  Nyikayaramba made the statement after Tsvangirai urged
military leaders to quit the army and enter politics as
civilians, the Harare-based newspaper reported. The brigadier-
general said Tsvangirai was talking “nonsense” because
 Zimbabwe  is under “foreign attack,” the Herald said.  The security services and President  Robert Mugabe ’s
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front are inseparable
and regard Tsvangirai as a “national threat,” Nyikayaramba
told the Herald. The army will do “anything possible” to
ensure Mugabe remains in power, the Herald said.  Mugabe will only leave office if he “sees fit or dies,”
the Herald quoted the brigadier-general as saying, adding that
the army would die to keep him in power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
