Coffee production in  Burundi , which
relies on the crop to generate more than half its foreign-
exchange earnings, may drop 13 percent this year amid declining
plantings, the Burundi Coffee Regulatory Agency said.  Output may fall to 21,000 metric tons from 24,000 tons in
2010, Pascal Girukwishaka, technical director of the Bujumbura-
based agency, said in an interview yesterday. Production is
declining amid a growing scarcity of land for the country’s
increasing population and a lack of labor to help farm the beans
as people leave rural areas to seek employment in the nation’s
cities, he said.  “Our coffee is so appreciated for its taste and we are
afraid we cannot meet demand,” Girukwishaka said.  Burundi grows mainly the arabica variety of coffee. Arabica
for September delivery fell 0.75 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.462
a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  yesterday. Prices of the
beans have surged 56 percent over the past year. Burundian
coffee exports increased to 361,217 60-kilogram bags from May
2010 to April 2011, compared with 138,872 bags in the same
period a year earlier, according to data on the  website  of the
 International Coffee Organization .  This year’s crop has been helped by “good rains” and
government efforts to boost soil fertility, Girukwishaka said,
without providing details. Of the 21,000 tons of coffee expected
to be produced this year, 12,000 tons will be “fully washed,” he
said. Washing coffee involves processing the beans in water.  Last month, the company that manages washing stations in
the East African nation, known as Sogestal, increased the amount
it pays farmers for their beans by 29 percent to 630 Burundian
francs (51 cents) per kilogram (2.2 pounds).  Girukwishaka said a survey conducted last year showed that
600,000 households in Burundi are involved in coffee production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
