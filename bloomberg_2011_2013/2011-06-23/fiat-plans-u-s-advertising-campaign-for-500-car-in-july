Chrysler Group LLC said it has
opened 70 Fiat stores in the U.S., more than halfway to its goal
of 130 locations this year, and plans to begin a national
marketing campaign July 4.  Chrysler is using the Fiat 500 small car to reintroduce the
Italian brand in the U.S. after Fiat pulled out almost 30 years
ago. Dealerships are open in markets that should cover 60
percent of Fiat’s expected sales, said Laura Soave, head of the
Fiat brand in the U.S.  “In our major markets, we’re starting to get filled,” she
said today in an interview at Chelsea,  Michigan . “I’m
comfortable now celebrating the arrival of the 500 in America
given the network that we have in place.”  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  wants to use the
Fiat 500 and other new models to more than double Chrysler’s
global sales to 2.8 million and produce $5 billion in operating
income by 2014. Chrysler reported first-quarter net income of
$116 million, its first since emerging from  bankruptcy
protection  in 2009.  The original 500 was introduced on July 4, 1957, Soave
said. The new 500 features a clam-shaped hood to evoke the
vehicle’s traditional design. Sales this year of the 500 through
May reached 3,141, according to researcher Autodata Corp.  Chrysler had conducted regional marketing campaigns in
places such as  Texas  and  Los Angeles , she said. The July 4
advertising “will be the beginning of a national rollout,” she
said.  She declined to provide details of the effort.  Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne wants to use the
