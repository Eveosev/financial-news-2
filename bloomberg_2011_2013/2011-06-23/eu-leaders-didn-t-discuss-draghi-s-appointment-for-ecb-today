European leaders didn’t discuss  Bank
of Italy  Governor Mario Draghi’s nomination to become the next
head of the European Central Bank during a summit meeting in
Brussels today, European Union President Herman Van Rompuy said.  Draghi’s nomination is on the agenda for a second meeting
tomorrow, Van Rompuy told reporters in Brussels late today.  The European Parliament today endorsed Draghi’s nomination
to succeed  Jean-Claude Trichet  as head of the ECB for an eight-
year term starting on Nov. 1.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  noted French
expectations that Draghi’s appointment would necessitate the
removal of fellow Italian Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the central
bank’s Executive Board.  “I do think that we are moving in a rule-based system and
the rule is that members” of the Executive Board are appointed
for eight years “and it’s up to them to decide,” Juncker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
