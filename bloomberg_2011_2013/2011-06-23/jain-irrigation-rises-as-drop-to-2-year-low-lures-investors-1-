Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. (JI) , the
world’s second-biggest irrigation-equipment maker, headed for
its steepest gain in more than four months after a decline to a
two-year low this week lured some investors.  The shares climbed 7.4 percent to 158.1 rupees at 2:40 p.m.
in Mumbai, bound for the biggest jump since Feb. 10. The stock,
the top performer on the Bombay Stock Exchange 200 Index today,
has climbed 16 percent since plunging on June 20 to the lowest
since July 2009.  “The stock had broken down so much that it’s obvious it
will move up,” said Shefali Doshi, an analyst at KJMC Capital
Market Services in Mumbai.  A forecast by  India ’s weather office on June 21 that
monsoon rainfall may be less than previously predicted may have
aided the rally, Doshi said. Falls in the June-to-September
season, the main source of irrigation for the nation’s 235
million farmers, may be 95 percent of the long-term average,
compared with 98 percent estimated in April, the state
forecaster said.  “Investors may also be factoring in higher demand for
irrigation equipment” on the monsoon outlook, Doshi said.  The stock trades at 16.4 times estimated earnings for the
year to March 31, 2012, the lowest in more than two years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The stock was upgraded to “buy” from “outperform” today
by Somshankar Sinha, an analyst at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets in
 Mumbai  wrote in a note, cutting the 12-month price estimate to
225 rupees from 250 earlier.  The brokerage, a unit of French lender Credit Agricole SA,
expects a “rebound” in Jain Irrigation’s cash flow as the
company may get delayed receivables of 9 billion rupees ($200
million) from three provincial governments in India in the year
ending March 31, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
