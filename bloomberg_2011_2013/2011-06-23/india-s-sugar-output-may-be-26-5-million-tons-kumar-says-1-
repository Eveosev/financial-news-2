India’s sugar production may be 26
million to 26.5 million metric tons in the 2011-12 season,
according to Vinay Kumar, managing director of the National
Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd.  The sugar cane area will expand by between 8 percent and 10
percent due to favourable weather and the profitability of cane
compared with other crops, he said today at the F.O. Licht Sugar
Trade Outlook conference in Brussels.  Production in the 2010-11 season will be above 24 million
tons, against domestic demand of 22 million tons, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
