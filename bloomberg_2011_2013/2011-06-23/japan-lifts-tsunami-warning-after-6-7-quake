The  Japan Meteorological Agency 
lifted a tsunami warning issued after the countryâ€™s strongest
earthquake in more than two months struck northern  Japan .  The 6.7-magnitude quake occurred at 6:51 a.m. Japan time,
centered off the coast of Iwate prefecture and registering lower
5 on the Japanese intensity scale of 7, the agency said. A
warning was issued for a possible 50-centimeter (20-inch)
tsunami.  No major damage has been reported, the Fire and Disaster
Management Agency said in a statement on its website. The
earthquake was the strongest since the 7.1-magnitude quake on
April 7, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A record 9-
magnitude temblor hit Japan on March 11, leaving more than
23,000 people dead or missing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
