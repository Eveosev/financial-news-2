Union Bank of  Nigeria  Plc, one of
the lenders bailed out by the nation’s central bank two years
ago, rose the most in 15 weeks after it said it will meet a
deadline to recapitalize by the end of September.  The stock climbed 11 kobo, or the maximum daily limit of 5
percent, to 2.31 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. The
increase was its most since March 10, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Union Bank will sign a “transactional implementation
agreement” next month with African Capital Alliance to inject
funds into the bank, Chief Executive Officer Funke Osibodu told
reporters in Lagos today. Additional money will come from the
Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria, and shareholders of the bank,
she said.  Union Bank signed an agreement with a group led by African
Capital Alliance to invest $750 million in Union Bank, the
lender said on March 23. The  Central Bank of Nigeria  has given
banks until Sept. 30 to recapitalize or risk being liquidated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
