France’s Industry Minister Eric
Besson asked Total SA to modify gasoline prices for consumers
after the  International Energy Agency  said its members would
release crude from strategic reserves.  Oil tumbled to the lowest price in four months as the
agency announced the release of 2 million barrels a day for 30
days beginning next week to help make up for a Libyan supply
disruption.  Brent crude  for August delivery fell $5.88, or 5.1 percent,
to $108.33 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange. Prices have risen 42 percent in the past year.  Besson asked Total, Europe’s largest oil refiner, to ensure
gasoline and diesel prices at its outlets in France reflect the
drop in crude prices “as soon as possible,” the statement
said. He said other gasoline distributors will be asked to take
similar measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
