Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said a U.S.
Senate vote implies much greater headwinds for further
extensions of ethanol policies, which expire at the year-end.  On June 16, the U.S. senate passed an amendment to repeal
the existing tax credit of 45 cents per gallon to ethanol
blenders and a tariff of 54 cents per gallon on imported
ethanol, the bank said in a note dated yesterday.  “While the vote was largely symbolic and we believe the
likelihood of an imminent repeal remains low, it still implies
much greater headwinds for further extensions of these ethanol
policies,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
