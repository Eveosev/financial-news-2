Following is the text of the monthly
McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge report.  At a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $376.1 billion, new
construction starts in May dropped 6% from the previous month,
it was reported by McGraw-Hill Construction, a division of The
McGraw-Hill Companies. Nonresidential building pulled back after
its improved level in March and April, while residential
building stayed weak. The nonbuilding construction sector showed
moderate growth in May, as a strong gain for electric utilities
offset a loss of momentum for public works. During the first
five months of 2011, total construction starts on an unadjusted
basis came in at $155.2 billion, down 9% from the same period a
year ago.  The May statistics produced a reading of 80 for the Dodge Index
(2000=100), compared to a revised 84 for April. “The pattern of
construction starts continues to hover at a low volume,
providing little evidence to this point that renewed expansion
is taking hold,” stated Robert A. Murray, vice president of
economic affairs for McGraw-Hill Construction. “The current year
has seen a few bright spots, such as gains for multifamily
housing, manufacturing plants, and electric utilities. In
general, though, the parts of the  construction industry  that are
most likely to see growth in the early stages of a cyclical
upturn, such as single family housing and commercial building,
have either wavered or at best shown only intermittent gains. At
the same time, the parts of the construction industry dependent
on public financing, such as institutional building and public
works, have weakened further. The result is that the current
period of ‘bouncing along the bottom’ for total construction is
becoming more and more extended.”  Nonresidential building in May plunged 12% to $138.7 billion
(annual rate), reflecting decreased activity for a majority of
the nonresidential structure types. On the institutional side,
transportation terminal work in May plummeted 59% after a robust
April, which had been lifted by the start of a $1.2 billion
airport terminal renovation and expansion at  New York ’s JFK
International Airport. May did see a few large transportation
related projects reach groundbreaking, such as a $176 million
subway station in New York NY, but these were smaller in scope
than what took place in April. The public buildings category in
May weakened 27%, despite the start of a $90 million courthouse
expansion in Rockville MD, and amusement-related projects
dropped 23%. A more moderate decline in May was reported for
educational buildings, which slipped 7% from April. Large
projects that provided some support to May’s amount of
educational building included a $175 million university research
facility in New York NY and a $79 million high school in Katy TX.
Healthcare construction was one institutional structure type
that was able to show greater activity in May, rising 15%. May
included the start of four large hospital or medical center
projects valued each at $100 million or greater, located in
 Colorado  ($299 million), California ($225 million),  Florida 
($166 million), and  Texas  ($100 million).  On the commercial side, hotel construction fell 64% in May,
compared to April which included groundbreaking for two hotels
valued at $127 million and $108 million, respectively. The
largest hotel to reach groundbreaking in May was a $30 million
Indian tribe casino hotel in Kinder LA. Office construction in
May fell 8%, continuing to retreat after its elevated pace in
March. The largest office project that reached groundbreaking in
May was a $130 million FBI office building in Salt Lake City UT.
Store construction in May also fell by 8%, as this structure
type continues to languish. The warehouse category in May was
able to jump 39%, helped by the start of two large warehouses
for discount retail chains, located in  Indiana  ($58 million) and
 Alabama  ($48 million). The manufacturing building category in
May advanced 35%, helped by the start of a $190 million biofuel
plant in Columbus MS, a $98 million manufacturer-owned
distribution facility in University Park IL, and a $75 million
battery manufacturing plant in Middletown DE. Residential
building, at $116.5 billion (annual rate), dropped 7% in May.
Single family housing slipped an additional 2%, as it has
generally receded during the early months of 2011. The May slide
was due to this behavior by region - the West, down 3%; the
Northeast and South Atlantic, each down 2%; and the Midwest and
South Central, no change from the prior month. Murray noted,
“Although  mortgage rates  have edged downward, helping to lift
affordability, the ongoing decline in  home prices  in early 2011
has led to more homebuyer uncertainty, which has stalled for now
any recovery for single family housing.” Multifamily housing in
May dropped 25%, retreating after April’s improved activity. The
five largest multifamily projects that reached groundbreaking in
May were apartment buildings, as opposed to condominiums, and
were located in San Diego CA ($60 million), Weymouth MA ($35
million), Sacramento CA ($30 million), Austin TX ($30 million),
and Wakefield MA ($30 million).  Nonbuilding construction in May grew 5% to $120.9 billion
(annual rate), reflecting continued strength for new electric
utility projects. The electric utility category in May soared
68%, helped in particular by the start of a $2.0 billion solar
generating station in Gila Bend AZ. Other large electric utility
projects in May included a $369 million natural gas-fired power
plant in Anchorage AK, a $260 million repowering for two units
of a natural gas-fired power plant facility in Long Beach CA,
and a $100 million wind power project in  Pennsylvania . In
contrast to strength for electric utilities, the public works
sector in May weakened 10%. Highway and bridge construction
plunged 20% in May, continuing to slide back after the strength
shown at the start of the year. The level of highway and bridge
construction is now reflecting the waning support from the
federal stimulus act, as well as diminished state spending given
budget constraints. Also showing weaker activity in May was
sewer construction, dropping 28% from the prior month, and
“miscellaneous” public works (comprised of site work, pipelines,
and mass transit) which fell 18%. The public works decline was
cushioned by a 55% gain for water supply systems, featuring a
$174 million upgrade to a water treatment plant in  California ,
as well as the start of a $100 million water treatment plant in
Florida. Also providing some support was a 48% gain for
river/harbor development, helped by the start of a $123 million
wharf and surrounding area redevelopment project in California.  The 9% decline for total construction starts on an unadjusted
basis during the first five months of 2011 was the result of
reduced activity for all three main construction sectors.
Nonresidential building in the January-May period of 2011 fell
8%, due to a 21% slide for the institutional categories. At the
same time, commercial building grew 9% year-to-date while
manufacturing building climbed 156%. Residential building in the
January-May period of 2011 dropped 13%, with the comparison to
the early months of 2010 when single family housing was still
being lifted by the homebuyer tax credits. Because single family
housing lost momentum at mid-2010, it’s expected that the 2011
year-to-date performance for single family housing will become
less negative as this year proceeds. Nonbuilding construction in
the January-May period of 2011 slipped 7%, the result of a 25%
reduction for public works combined with a 105% increase for
electric utilities. By geography, total construction in the
first five months of 2011 showed shortfalls in four of the five
main regions - the South Atlantic, down 17%; the Midwest, down
16%; the Northeast, down 15%; and the South Central, down 5%.
The West was the one major region that was able to report a
year-to-date increase for total construction, rising 3%.
