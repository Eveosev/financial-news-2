More than 100 people were raped or
beaten in a series of attacks in eastern  Democratic Republic of
Congo  over two days in June, according to Geneva-based Medecins
Sans Frontieres, an emergency medical aid group.  Unknown armed men raided villages about 50 kilometers (31
miles) north of the town of Fizi in South Kivu province between
June 10 and June 12, said Megan Hunter, MSF-Holland’s head of
office for the province.  “Our health centers have registered more than 100 cases of
rape and physical abuse,” she said by phone today from Bukavu,
the provincial capital. Mineral-rich eastern Congo has suffered
more than 15 years of conflict and rape has become common in the
struggle between more than a dozen armed groups and the
Congolese army.  On Feb. 21, a South Kivu military court convicted four army
officers of ordering the rapes of more than 50 people in Fizi on
Jan. 1. The soldiers are appealing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
