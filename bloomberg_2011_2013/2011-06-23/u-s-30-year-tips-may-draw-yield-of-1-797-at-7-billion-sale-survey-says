The government’s auction of $7
billion of 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities may
draw a yield of 1.797 percent, according to seven primary
dealers in a Bloomberg News survey.  The sale is a reopening of the $9 billion offering of the
securities on Feb. 17. Auctions of 30-year TIPS were resumed in
February 2010 after the Treasury stopped selling them in 2001.
The inflation-linked bonds will mature in February 2041. Bids
are due by 1 p.m. New York time.  The securities yielded 2.19 percent at the last offering.
The February sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.54,
versus an average of 2.59 over the three auctions since sales
resumed.  Indirect bidders, a category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 55.2 percent of the securities at
the February sale, compared with an average of 45.5 percent at
the past three auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 3.6 percent of
the securities at the last sale, versus a 12.7 percent average
at the past three auctions.  Inflation-indexed notes pay interest at lower rates than
nominal Treasuries on a principal amount that’s linked to the
Labor Department’s consumer price index. TIPS overall have
returned 5.3 percent in 2011, compared with 3.1 percent for
conventional Treasuries, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  The  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers trade  government
securities  with the central bank and are obligated to
participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
