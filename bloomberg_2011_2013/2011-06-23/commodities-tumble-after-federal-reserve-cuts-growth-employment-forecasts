Commodities dropped after the
 Federal Reserve  reduced its growth and employment forecasts for
the world’s biggest economy, worsening the outlook for demand.  Crude oil lost 2.7 percent to $92.88 a barrel at 12:29 p.m.
in  London , zinc fell 1 percent to $2,228.50 a metric ton and
corn dropped 1.9 percent to $6.3775 a bushel. Gold for immediate
delivery fell 0.7 percent to $1,537.90 an ounce and the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities slid 1.9 percent.  The Fed reiterated a pledge to keep  interest rates  near
zero and said it will complete a $600 billion bond-purchase
program as scheduled this month, even as Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the recovery is progressing “more slowly” than
expected. The economy will expand between 2.7 percent to 2.9
percent this year, down from forecasts ranging from 3.1 percent
to 3.3 percent in April, it said.  The central bank “acknowledged that the slowdown may not
be temporary but offered no hint of further monetary support,”
commodity analysts at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
led by  Mark Pervan  said in a report. “The cautious tone in the
Fed’s statement dashed expectations of some looking for a hint
of more asset purchases.”  Commodities rallied about 80 percent in the two years to
the end of 2010 as central banks worldwide spent trillions of
dollars to boost growth and rescue banks from the 2008 financial
crisis and economic slowdown.  Inventories Gain  Oil for August delivery declined as much as 2.9 percent to
$92.67 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . U.S. oil
stockpiles dropped less than forecast and inventories at
Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for the New York-traded
West Texas Intermediate grade, increased for the first time in
four weeks.  “The fundamental story across the board is of limited
growth,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity
Broking Services Pty in Sydney. “We’ve got plenty of crude.
It’s got to be a geopolitical event” to push crude above $100 a
barrel again, he said.  Copper, zinc and aluminum declined. Copper for three-month
delivery dropped as much as 0.8 percent to $8,940 a ton on the
London Metal Exchange, and last traded at $8,970.  Corn tumbled and wheat fell as improving weather boosted
output prospects in the U.S., the largest exporter. December-
delivery corn fell as much as 2.3 percent to $6.35 a bushel.  Gold for August delivery fell 1 percent to $1,538.70 an
ounce. Futures climbed to $1,559.30 yesterday, the highest for a
most-active contract since May 2, when the price reached a
record $1,577.40.  Prices of gold and silver may decline in the next three
months, said  Marc Faber , publisher of the Gloom, Boom & Doom
report. Still, he will keep accumulating gold, Faber said in a
Bloomberg Television interview from  Hong Kong .  To contact the reporter on this story:
