NCB Stockbrokers Ltd. , the Irish
securities firm, is in talks on selling itself to  Investec Plc (INVP) ,
the  Sunday Times  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Discussions may have developed from contact between the
companies about Irish businessman Sean Quinn’s 24 percent stake
in NCB, the newspaper said. It cited Michael Mullen, chief
executive officer of Investec Ireland, as saying the company is
interested in expanding in the country and has “been in
discussions with a number of entities over the past six
months.”  A spokesman for NCB declined to comment to Bloomberg News
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
