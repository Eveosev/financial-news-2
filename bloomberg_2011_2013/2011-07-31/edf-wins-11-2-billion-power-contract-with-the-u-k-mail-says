EDF SA (EDF) ’s British unit won a 6.8
billion-pound ($11.2 billion) power supply contract, the U.K.’s
biggest, the Mail on Sunday reported, without saying where it
got the figure.  EDF will supply electricity to the U.K.’s National Health
Service, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Justice, Metropolitan
Police,  London Underground  and other agencies over a four-year
period beginning in April, the company said in a statement last
week. The initial volume is equal to powering 2.3 million
households, EDF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
