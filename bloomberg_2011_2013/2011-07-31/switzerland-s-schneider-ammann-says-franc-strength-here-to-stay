The Swiss franc’s strength against
the euro and the dollar is here to stay, heralding some
“extremely tough years” for exporters and the  tourism
industry , Swiss Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said.  “The franc’s current strength is more than a temporary
phenomenon,” Schneider-Ammann said in remarks prepared for
delivery today. “In the foreseeable future, the franc won’t
return to where it was two or three years ago.”  Companies are sacrificing profitability to make sure their
order levels are “at least to some extent” maintained,
Schneider-Ammann said. The fundamental changes caused by the
euro-area and U.S. debt crises are “too far-reaching” for the
effects to pass quickly, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
