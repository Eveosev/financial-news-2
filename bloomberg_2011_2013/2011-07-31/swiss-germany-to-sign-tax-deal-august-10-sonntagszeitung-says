Switzerland and  Germany  will sign a
 tax treaty  on August 10 and Swiss banks will have to pay 2
billion Swiss francs ($2.54 billion) upfront as part of the
agreement,  SonntagsZeitung  newspaper said.  The accord, which settles a dispute over  tax evasion  by
wealthy German clients, will have to be approved later by Swiss
parliament, the Zurich-based newspaper said, citing people
familiar with the situation. The upfront payment will be
refunded to Swiss banks if Germany’s tax authorities receive at
least 4 billion francs through the agreement, the report said.  A separate treaty with the U.K., which foresees an upfront
payment of 500 million francs by Switzerland’s banks, will be
signed later, SonntagsZeitung said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
