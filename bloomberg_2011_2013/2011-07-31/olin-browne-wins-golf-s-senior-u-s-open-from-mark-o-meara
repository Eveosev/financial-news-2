Olin Browne shot a final round 71
for a three-shot win at golf’s Senior  U.S. Open , his first title
on the U.S. PGA Champions Tour.  Browne finished with a four-round total of 15-under-par 269.
Runner-up  Mark O’Meara  had a 1-over-par 72 today at the
 Inverness Club  in Toledo,  Ohio . Mark Calcavecchia finished third,
a shot behind O’Meara.  “It was really a hard day,” Browne told NBC in a
televised interview. “The wind was blowing, the greens were
drying out a little bit and even though I couldn’t get anything
going my only bogey was a three-putt on the front nine.”  The 52-year-old Browne, who won the last of his three U.S.
 PGA Tour  titles at the Deutsche Bank Championship six years ago,
joins 1994 champion Simon Hobday as the only players in the 32-
year history of the Senior U.S. Open to lead from start to
finish.  Browne took the lead at 14-under when O’Meara dropped a
shot at the 13th hole. The lead doubled three holes later when
O’Meara had another bogey.  On the last green, Browne rolled in a putt of about 30 feet
for birdie to secure the three-shot win.  O’Meara was seeking his third win on the 50-and-over
Champions Tour and his first in a senior major. The 54-year-old
won 16 times on the PGA Tour, with his last two wins coming at
the Masters Tournament and  British Open  in 1998. His two wins on
the Champions Tour came in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
