Corn and soybeans may fall for the
second straight week as rain and cooler temperatures bolster
crops, while a sluggish  U.S. economy  and rising global interest
rates erode demand for grains and oilseeds.  Fourteen of 27 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo  to
Chicago on July 29 forecast that corn will drop, and 15 of 28
respondents said soybeans will decline.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery fell 2.4 percent to $6.6875 a bushel after
gaining 15 percent in the previous three weeks. Soybean futures
for November delivery dropped 2.2 percent to $13.5725 a bushel,
snapping a four-week rally.  Last weekâ€™s declines in corn and soybeans were a surprise
to the majority of analysts and traders surveyed on July 22.  Bearish on corn: 14    Bearish on soybeans: 15
Bullish on corn: 13    Bullish on soybeans: 13  To contact the reporter on this story:
