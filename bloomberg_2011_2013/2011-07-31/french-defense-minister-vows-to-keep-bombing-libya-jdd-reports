French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said  France  will continue aerial bombing of Muammar Qaddafi’s forces from a  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  base
in Sicily following a planned withdrawal of its  aircraft
carrier , the  Journal du Dimanche  reported, citing an interview.  European countries including Spain, Germany and Poland
should help more with the conflict in Libya, where France will
be engaged for the “long haul,” Longuet was quoted as saying
by the newspaper. He called for the population of Tripoli to
rise up against Qaddafi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
