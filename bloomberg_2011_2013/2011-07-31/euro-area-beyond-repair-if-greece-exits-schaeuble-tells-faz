German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the European monetary union would suffer an
“irreparable loss of faith” if  Greece  or another member were
to quit the single-currency zone, according to  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung .  “I don’t want to imagine what would be if markets would
realize that they are able to push individual countries out of
the  euro zone ,” the newspaper quoted Schaeuble as saying in an
interview published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
