A minibus taxi crashed into a tree
in  Zimbabwe  yesterday, killing at least 20 people, police said.  Eighteen people died at the accident site on the Harare-
Centenary highway, while two others died in the hospital, police
spokesman Oliver Mandipaka said in a telephone interview from
Harare today.  “After preliminary investigations it looks like the right
rear wheel came off, leading to the accident,” Mandipaka said.
The vehicle was “overloaded,” he said.  Minibus taxis, known locally as “ETs” or emergency taxis,
compete with buses and coaches in Zimbabwe’s mainly privately
owned transport sector.  Centenary is a tobacco-growing district in northeastern
Zimbabwe. The town is about 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the
capital, Harare.  To contact the reporter on this story:
