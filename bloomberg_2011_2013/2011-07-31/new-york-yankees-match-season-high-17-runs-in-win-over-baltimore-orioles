The  New York Yankees  defeated the
 Baltimore Orioles  17-3 last night, match the season-high runs-
scored they posted at home on July 22 against Oakland.  The Yankees swept the split doubleheader at Yankee Stadium,
beating the Orioles earlier in the day by 8-5.  The Yankees scored 12 runs on 10 hits in the bottom of a
first inning that lasted 58 minutes. It was most runs the team
ever scored in a first inning, and the most since a 13-run
eighth inning against Tampa Bay on June 21, 2005.  Seven Yankees had extra-base hits, with Nick Swisher and
Andruw Jones hitting home runs. In the first inning, all nine
batters reached based at least once and all scored at least one
run.  Shortstop  Derek Jeter  went 2-for-6 to tie Rafael Palmeiro
for 24th place on Major League Baseball’s all-time career hits
list at 3,020.  Ivan Nova (9-4) gave up six hits and two runs in seven hits
while striking out six for the Yankees.  Zach Britton (6-8) surrendered seven hits and nine runs in
a third of an inning. Reliever Jason Berken allowed eight hits
and seven runs, including the two home runs, in 2 2/3 innings.
Britton and Berken combined for 70 pitches.  The Yankees (63-42) trail the  Boston Red Sox  by two games
in the American League East Division. The Orioles (42-62) are
last in the five-team division, 22 ½ games behind  Boston .  To contact the reporter on this story:
