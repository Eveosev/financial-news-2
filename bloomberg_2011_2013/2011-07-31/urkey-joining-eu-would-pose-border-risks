A panel of U.K. lawmakers said it’s
concerned about risks to the European Union from organized crime
and illegal immigration if  Turkey  joins because of inadequate
security along the country’s borders with Iran, Iraq and Syria.  Turkey must demonstrate “clearly and objectively” that
it’s met stringent criteria set by the EU for the management of
its frontiers before it can join, the  House of Commons Home
Affairs Committee  said in a report released in  London  today. It
said Turkey was a key point along routes for smuggling drugs and
trafficking people into the 27-nation bloc.  “I am concerned that, if action is not taken now, it will
become even easier for migrants from countries such as
Afghanistan and Iran to enter the EU once Turkey is a member”
the panel’s chairman, Keith Vaz, said in an e-mailed statement.  Turkey’s bid to join the EU has stalled, with the country
having completed negotiations in only one of 35 policy areas.
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  oppose Turkish membership, while U.K. Prime Minister
David Cameron vowed on a trip to Ankara last year to be the
“strongest possible advocate” for Turkish accession.  The Commons committee said the potential benefits from
Turkish membership outweigh the risks. Even so, it called on the
 Home Office  to assess the likely scale of Turkish immigration to
Britain. At least 200,000 migrants arrived each year in the U.K.
between 2004 and 2007 after eight East European countries joined
the EU, compared with official predictions of an annual flow of
about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
