The Swiss central bank should
intervene to prevent the franc from strengthening,  Swatch Group
AG (UHR)  Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek told  SonntagsZeitung .  The  Swiss National Bank  should accept public criticism of
the losses stemming from its previous interventions and show
more resolve in fighting the currency’s appreciation, Hayek told
the Zurich-based newspaper in an interview.  Raising prices because of the franc’s gains would erode
market share, so Swatch has to accept declining profitability,
Hayek said, according to the newspaper. The Biel-based company
is sticking to its revenue and profit targets, the CEO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
