The U.K.’s coalition government cut
administrative costs by 3.75 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) in
its first 10 months in office by curbing use of consultants and
renegotiating supply accords.  The consulting bill dropped by 870 million pounds, Cabinet
Office Minister Francis Maude said today in an e-mailed
statement. Expenses for temporary workers slid by 500 million
pounds, the statement shows.  The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition aims to squeeze
spending the most since World War II without damaging services
such as schools and hospitals. Prime Minister  David Cameron  and
Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne say the cuts are
needed to reduce the budget deficit.  “It is these savings, which have been achieved in just 10
months, that have allowed departments to protect essential
front-line services and jobs,” Maude said. “But this is just
scratching the surface of what we have planned for the coming
months and years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
