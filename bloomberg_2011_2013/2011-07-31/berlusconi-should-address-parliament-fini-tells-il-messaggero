Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  should address Parliament on the state of the
nation’s economy,  Gianfranco Fini , President of the Chamber of
Deputies,  told   Il Messaggero  in an interview.  Fini’s comments follow an official request from the
country’s main opposition parties asking Berlusconi to inform
the Parliament about the economic situation after bond yields
surged, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
