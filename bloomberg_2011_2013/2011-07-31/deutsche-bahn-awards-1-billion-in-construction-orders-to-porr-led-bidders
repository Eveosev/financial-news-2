Deutsche Bahn AG assigned more than
700 million euros ($1 billion) in construction orders for a
German railroad project to bidders led by Austrian builder
 Allgemeine Baugesellschaft Porr AG. (POS)   Orders awarded to the group cover about a quarter of all
projects related to construction of a high-speed rail station in
the southwestern city of Stuttgart, known as Stuttgart 21,
Deutsche Bahn spokesman Martin Walden said today by phone. The
company,  Germany ’s state-owned railroad, is based in Berlin.  The Porr-led group will start preparations for constructing
a 9.5-kilometer (5.9-mile) tunnel connecting the new station
with Stuttgart’s airport and exhibition center and a second
tunnel of 6 kilometers, according to Walden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
