Zambia’s presidential aspirants must
file their nominations between Aug. 7 and Aug. 10, the Post
newspaper reported, citing  Electoral Commission  of Zambia
Director Priscilla Isaacs.  Candidates need evidence of citizenship and must pay about
$2,000 to the government as a nomination fee, Isaacs said. They
will also be required to be accompanied by at least 200
supporters who are registered voters.  President Rupiah Banda dissolved both cabinet and
parliament on Jun. 28 and called elections for Sept. 20. He is
constitutionally required to announce a date within 90 days of
dissolving parliament and cabinet.  Banda is the preferred candidate for the ruling Movement
for Multiparty Democracy, while Michael Sata is the candidate
for the second largest party, the Patriotic Front. Sata narrowly
lost in the previous ballot in 2008.  Zambia’s economy has expanded more than 6 percent on
average each year since Banda became president in 2008 as demand
for copper increases. His predecessor, Levy Mwanawasa, died in
office. The government will invite foreign observers to ensure
the election is free and fair, Banda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
