Police in  China â€™s northwest Xinjiang
province shot and killed four people, bringing the death toll
from two days of violence to at least 14, the state-run Xinhua
 News Agency  said.  The four were killed after three people were slain by
rioters yesterday in the city of Kashgar, the news agency said.
Xinhua had earlier reported that the three were killed in an
explosion that was heard in the city in the afternoon. Police
took four people into custody and were looking for four more.  The shootings in Xinjiang, where the Beijing government has
faced ethnic-related violence in the past, came after at least
seven people were killed July 30 in Kashgar, Xinhua said. Two
people hijacked a truck, stabbed the driver to death and rammed
into pedestrians, the agency said. They then got out of the
truck and started stabbing people, it said.  Years of central government policies encouraging migration
of majority Han Chinese to areas such as Tibet and Xinjiang have
stoked ethnic tensions.  On July 18, police in the Xinjiang city of Hotan shot 14
people who attacked a police station, Xinhua said. citing an
unidentified Communist Party official in the city.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
