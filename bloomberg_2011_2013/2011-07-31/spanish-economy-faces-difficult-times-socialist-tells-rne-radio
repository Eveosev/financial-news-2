Spain ’s economy still faces tough
times ahead of the country’s elections slated for Nov. 20,
Socialist candidate Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told state-owned
 Radio Nacional de Espana .  “Elections don’t change the economic situation of Spain,”
Rubalcaba said. “There are still difficult times ahead but
we’re seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.”  It’s also “reasonable, fair and achievable” to set up a
new tax for Spanish banks in order to create jobs for young
people after they finish the current restructuring process, he
said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
