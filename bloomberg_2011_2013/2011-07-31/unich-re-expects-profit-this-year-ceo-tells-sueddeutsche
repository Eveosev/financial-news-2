Munich Re  expects to post a profit
this year,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Nikolaus von Bomhard.  Separately, Bomhard criticized European Union leaders for
their handling of the region’s debt crisis, the newspaper said
in a preview of an interview to be published tomorrow.  “There mustn’t be a second  Greece ,” Sueddeutsche quoted
the CEO as saying. “Europe cannot bear further crises or crisis
solutions of that kind.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
