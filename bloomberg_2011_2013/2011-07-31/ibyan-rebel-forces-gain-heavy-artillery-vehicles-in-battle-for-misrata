Libyan rebel forces in the besieged
city of Misrata said they broke through enemy lines to capture
tanks, heavy guns and rocket launchers, gaining an arsenal that
may help reverse their fortunes in the five-month siege.  The rebels captured 155 millimeter guns, as well as truck-
mounted rocket launchers and three armored carriers following
clashes late yesterday and today, said Abdullah Maiteed, a
member of the rebel Arise Brigade.  Gaining heavy artillery may change the balance of forces on
the Misrata front, giving rebels heavy weapons for the first
time to confront forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi’s regime. The
North Atlantic Treaty Organization has supported the rebel
fighters with a campaign that has lasted since March.  Some 14 rebel fighters have been killed and more than sixty
wounded in the fighting west of the city, Misrata’s Mujema
Alejdat hospital said. Doctors also treated seven wounded
government soldiers captured in the fighting, the hospital said.
No figures of government casualties were available.  Rockets landed in the city center in the early hours of
Sunday morning, killing three men and wounding one, according to
the hospital. Armed forces loyal to Qaddafi assaulted the rebel
stronghold of Misrata yesterday, using tanks and artillery.  The conflict remains at a stalemate, with Qaddafi retaining
control of Tripoli, and rebel offensives in recent weeks failing
to capture Brega in the east or Zlitan, near Misrata, in the
west.  To contact the reporter on this story:
