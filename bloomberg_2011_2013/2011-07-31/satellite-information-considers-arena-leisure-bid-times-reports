Satellite Information Services Ltd.
is considering a 200 million-pound ($329 million) bid for  Arena
Leisure Plc (ARE) , a racecourse owner in  England , the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Satellite Information Systems, which broadcasts horseracing
to betting shops, hired Deutsche Bank AG to advise on a
potential bid, the newspaper said. Arena said last month itâ€™s
reviewing its options to increase value for its shareholders,
which may include a takeover offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
