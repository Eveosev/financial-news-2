New York’s Museum of  Modern Art ,
which is raising adult admission 25 percent to $25, paid
Director  Glenn Lowry  $1.6 million in 2009.  Though Lowry took a 14 percent compensation cut, he
remained among the best paid museum directors. His salary and
bonus totaled $830,000. He also received $403,635 in retirement
and other deferred compensation, plus housing in the museum’s
luxury condominium tower valued at $318,000, according to MoMA’s
2009-2010  tax return .  The admission increase from $20 goes into effect Sept. 1, a
result of escalating costs, the museum announced last week.  Ellen Futter, who runs the  American Museum of Natural
History , earned $972,249 in salary and benefits in 2009, up 0.5
percent from a year earlier. The  Metropolitan Museum  of Art paid
its new chief, Thomas Campbell, $929,735. In July, the Met
raised its adult admission to $25, which, unlike MoMA’s, is
“suggested.”  Both Futter and Campbell earned what amounts to 20 cents
per visitor in 2009-2010, while Lowry earned more than 50 cents
for every attendee. The Met and the Museum of Natural History
are public institutions that sit on city-owned land and depend
on government beneficence. By contrast, MoMA sits on private
land and receives little government operating support.  Since being hired from Toronto’s  Art Gallery of Ontario  in
1995, Lowry has worked to double gallery space. He led an $858
million capital campaign that increased square footage for
exhibitions by 40,000, to 125,000.  More Gallery Space  To expand further, MoMA paid $31 million for the 30,000-
square-foot American Folk Art Museum building next door. A 2007
agreement calls for the developer Hines to build a mixed-use
skyscraper adjacent to MoMA that will add about 40,000 square
feet to exhibition space.  The museum established Lowry’s pay preeminence early. He
received $5.2 million in his first eight years, in addition to
compensation directly from the museum, according to spokesman
Kim Mitchell. The money came from a trust created by two museum
 board members ,  David Rockefeller  and Agnes Gund.  Lowry got $2.2 million for living expenses, including
mortgage and maintenance payments for an Upper East Side
apartment that he bought. The museum also gave him money for the
down payment, Mitchell said. In 1999, the trust bought the
apartment from Lowry for $3 million. He netted $1.3 million from
the sale, she said.  A record 3.1 million people visited MoMA in the 12 months
ending in June 2010. Draws included an exhibition of work by
film director Tim Burton, and the performance artist  Marina Abramovic  sitting motionless among dancers, many nude, standing,
lying down and suspended on a wall.  Outside New York, Michael Brand, the director of the J.
Paul Getty Museum in  Los Angeles  until January 2010, earned 
$891,114 in pay and benefits in 2009, while James Cuno, 
president and director of the Art Institute of  Chicago ,
earned $1.1 million. Cuno takes over the J. Paul Getty Trust
today.  To contact the writer on the story:
