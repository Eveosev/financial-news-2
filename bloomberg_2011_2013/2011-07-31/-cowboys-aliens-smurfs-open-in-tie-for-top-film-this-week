“Cowboys & Aliens,” featuring
Daniel Craig as an Old West gunman who battles space invaders,
and  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s “The Smurfs” opened in a tie for the top
movie in the U.S. and  Canada  this weekend with each posting
$36.2 million in ticket sales.  Last weekend’s leader, “Captain America: The First
Avenger,” fell to third place with sales of $24.9 million,
researcher  Hollywood.com Box-Office  said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “Cowboys & Aliens” is the third film from  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s
Universal division to open in first place this year, following
“Fast Five” and “Hop.” The film, co-produced by  Steven Spielberg ’s DreamWorks SKG and Relativity Media LLC, was
expected to have sales of $36 million, the estimate of  Brandon Gray , editor of Boxofficemojo.com, an industry website.  “The Smurfs,” combining live action and computer-
generated effects, stars Neil Patrick Harris as a  New Yorker  who
helps the tiny, blue creatures after they are forced from their
village by an evil wizard. The picture is based on characters
from the late cartoonist Pierre Culliford.  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s “Crazy Stupid Love” with  Steve Carell 
collected $19.3 million to open in fifth place.  In the film from  Warner Bros ., Carell is a straight-laced
family man whose life unravels after he discovers that his wife
has cheated on him. A younger man, played by Ryan Gosling,
guides him through a world of singles bars and flirting women.  To contact the reporters on this story:
