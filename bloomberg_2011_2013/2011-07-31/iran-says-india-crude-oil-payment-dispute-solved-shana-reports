Iran  solved a conflict with  India 
over payments for crude supplies, the oil ministry said.  “Following intensive negotiations between Iran and India,
the two parties agreed to clear the debts as soon as possible,”
Ahmad Qalebani, managing director of National Iranian Oil Co.,
was quoted as saying in a report today on the ministry’s news
website  Shana . “Part of the debts will be cleared in coming
days and the rest of the payments will be made gradually.”
Iran’s oil exports to India are “ongoing,” he said.  Qalebani didn’t specify the channel that will be used for
the payments.  Iran is constrained by international sanctions over its
nuclear program, and Indian refiners say the restrictions have
made banks unwilling to transfer payments for purchases of the
nation’s oil. India owes $5 billion for oil shipments, Iranian
Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani said on July 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
