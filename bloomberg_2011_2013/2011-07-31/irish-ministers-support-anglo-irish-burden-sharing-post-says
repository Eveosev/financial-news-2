Ireland’s government should adopt an
aggressive stance in talks with the  European Central Bank  later
this year on senior Anglo Irish Bank Corp. bondholders sharing
the lender’s losses, the  Sunday Business Post  reported, citing
two unidentified ministers.  The government has repeatedly said it will not act
unilaterally to force losses on senior bondholders in Anglo
Irish and smaller rival, Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Anglo Irish Chief Executive  Mike Aynsley  has asked the
government to explore with the ECB and European Commission the
option of senior Anglo Irish bondholders taking voluntary
discounts on their bonds, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
