England ’s Simon Dyson scored a
final-round 67, 4-under par, to win golf’s Irish Open by a shot
today.  Dyson finished on 15-under-par 269. Richard Green of
Australia was second in Killarney, and Scotland’s Stephen
Gallacher was third, two shots further back. The winner received
a check for 250,000 euros ($360,000).  Competitors included Northern Irishmen who’ve won three of
the last six majors: Graeme McDowell (2010 U.S. Open), Rory
McIlroy (2011 U.S. Open) and Darren Clarke (2011 British Open).  Clarke failed to make the halfway cut, while McIlroy and
McDowell finished down the field on 3-under and 4-under,
respectively.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
