Jose Sergio Gabrielli, chief
executive officer of Petroleo Brasiliero SA, has been acting as
an undeclared candidate for governor of his native state of
Bahia in northeastern  Brazil ,  O Estado de S. Paulo  reported.  The executive has visited several cities in Bahia in the
past two months, taking part in traditional Saint John’s
festivities in the company of local politicians, Estado said.  Gabrielli said it’s too soon to talk about the 2014 state
government election, and that he’s been visiting festivities
which are sponsored by state-controlled Petrobras, Estado said,
citing an e-mailed statement from the company.  Petrobras spent 10.6 million reais ($6.8 million) in
sponsorships for Saint John-related events this year in six
states in Brazil’s northeastern region, with Bahia getting 8.5
million reais of the total, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
