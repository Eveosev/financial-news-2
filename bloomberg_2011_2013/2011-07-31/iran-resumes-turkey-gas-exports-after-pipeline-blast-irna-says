     July 31 (Bloomberg) - Iran has resumed its gas export to
neighboring  Turkey  after repairing a natural  gas pipeline  that
exploded two days ago, the official  Islamic Republic News Agency 
reported, citing Javad Owji, the National Iranian Gas Co.’s
managing director.  Gas exports to Turkey resumed at mid-day today after the
final stages of the repair were completed, Owji said yesterday
in a report published by IRNA.  A July 29 explosion in Iran’s gas link to Turkey temporarily
disrupted gas supplies to the country’s western neighbor. The
explosion took place near the Bazargan border crossing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
