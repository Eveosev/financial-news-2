Prudential Plc (PRU)  will raise its half-
year dividend by 20 percent this week on better interim earnings
and a bid to improve its relationship with investors, the  Sunday
Telegraph  reported, citing analysts.  The dividend will jump to 7.95 pence a share on operating
profit of 970 million pounds ($1.6 billion), the newspaper said.
The London-based insurer raised its dividend by 20 percent in
March after 2010 profit beat expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
