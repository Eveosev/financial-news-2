Norges Bank Investment Management,
 Norway ’s $570 billion sovereign wealth fund, and the  Crown
Estate  made a joint purchase of two properties on London’s
Regent Street for 28 million pounds ($46 million), the  Sunday
Telegraph  reported, citing the fund’s chief investment officer
for real estate.  The two groups bought Maddox House for 23 million pounds
from pension fund clients of Aberdeen Asset Management, and 4
Conduit Street from a private investor, the newspaper said.
The Oslo-based fund previously bought a 25 percent stake in the
Regent Street shopping area.  “We’re delighted to have made these purchases and expect
to continue to broaden our partnership with the Crown Estate on
Regent Street,” Karsten Kallevig told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
