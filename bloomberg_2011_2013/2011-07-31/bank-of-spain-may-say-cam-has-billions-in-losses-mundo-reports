The Bank of  Spain  may say  Caja de
Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM)  has losses amounting to at least 2
billion euros ($2.9 billion),  El Mundo  reported, citing
unidentified people in the financial industry.  A review of Alicante, Spain-based CAMâ€™s balance sheet in
August and a reorganization of credits and provisions for
credits of lower quality will explain the losses, the newspaper
said. The Bank of Spain said July 22 it planned to take over the
savings bank, replace its management and prepare to sell the
company.  Phone calls to the Bank of Spain and CAM outside of normal
business hours today were unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
