Lansdowne Partners Ltd., a London-
based hedge fund, sold its $850 million stake in  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) , the  Sunday Telegraph  reported, without saying where
it got the information.  The decision was based partly on reduced proprietary
trading at Goldman Sachs stemming from regulation in the U.S.,
the newspaper said.  Lansdowne was among the top 20 investors in Goldman Sachs,
and the stake made up almost 10 percent of the hedge fundâ€™s $10
billion under management, according to the Sunday Telegraph.  The last time Lansdowne sold shares of Goldman Sachs was
before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008,
the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
