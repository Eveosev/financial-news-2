WH Smith Plc (SMWH) ’s 10 largest investors
have asked Chief Executive Kate Swann to break up the company’s
travel division from the main retailer, the Mail on Sunday
reported, citing the unnamed investors.  The investors say the company’s share price doesn’t reflect
the growth potential of the airport and railway station shops as
its main retail business declines because of a weakened economy,
the newspaper said. The travel division brings in about a third
of sales and is responsible for half of its profit, the Mail
said.  A call to WH Smith’s press office wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
