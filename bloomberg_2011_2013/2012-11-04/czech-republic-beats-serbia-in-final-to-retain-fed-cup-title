The Czech Republic retained its Fed
Cup tennis title as Lucie Safarova beat Jelena Jankovic in
straight sets to establish an unbeatable 3-1 lead.  Safarova, ranked No. 17 on the WTA Tour, had won only one
of her six previous matches against the 22nd-ranked Jankovic but
was untroubled today in a 6-1, 6-1 victory in  Prague .  “It’s fantastic because it happened at home, in Prague, in
front of our home fans,” Safarova told reporters. “It was one
of the best matches I’ve played in my career.”  Earlier, Ana Ivanovic had maintained Serbia’s chances of a
maiden title with a 6-3, 7-5 win against Petra Kvitova for her
team’s first victory of the best-of-five final.  Safarova’s win ended any hope of a Serbian comeback and
made the Czech Republic the third straight nation to win
 successive titles.  Russia won in 2007 and 2008, followed by
 Italy  in 2009 and 2010.  In total the Czechs now have seven Fed Cup titles,
including five as part of the old  Czechoslovakia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
