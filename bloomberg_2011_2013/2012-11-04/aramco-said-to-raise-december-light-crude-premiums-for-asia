Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, raised premiums used in determining
official selling prices for December shipments of light grades
to  Asia , it said.  The state-owned producer, known as  Saudi Aramco , also
increased the differentials for Arab Medium and Arab Heavy
crudes to buyers in the U.S. and raised them for all grades for
buyers in Northwest  Europe  and the Mediterranean, the company
said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Differentials for light
grades shipped to the U.S. and on medium and heavy crudes to
Asia will be lower in December than they were for November.  The premium for Arab Light crude to Asia increased by 20
cents a barrel to $2.95 more than the average of the Oman and
Dubai grades, the Gulf benchmarks used by traders in Asia, the
person said. Aramco cut the differential for U.S. buyers of Arab
Light to 75 cents a barrel more than the  Argus Sour Crude Index ,
50 cents lower than the level set for November.  Persian Gulf oil producers such as  Saudi Arabia  sell most of
their crude under long-term contracts to refiners. Most of the
region’s state oil companies price their oil at a premium or
discount to a benchmark.  The following table gives differentials for the regions
into which Aramco sells in relation to benchmark prices, the
month-on-month change and the degrees of gravity as defined by
the  American Petroleum Institute . Prices are in U.S. dollars a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
