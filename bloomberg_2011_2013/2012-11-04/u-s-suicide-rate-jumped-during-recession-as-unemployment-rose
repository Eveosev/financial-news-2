The suicide rate in the U.S.
increased during the recession, a sign that rising joblessness
took a toll on Americans’ mental health, researchers said.  About 1,580 additional suicides occurred annually in the
U.S. from 2008 to 2010 than would have been expected based on
statistical trends before the recession, according to a letter
published today in the  Lancet  journal by researchers from the
U.K.,  Hong Kong  and the U.S. They looked at suicide mortality
statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention for 1999 through 2010, according to the letter.  The findings add to evidence from other countries that the
recession and debt crisis have harmed mental health. Previous
studies found that  Greece  and  Spain , two of the countries hit
hardest by the economic duress, showed increases in illnesses
including depression.  “Suicide is a rare outcome of mental illness but this
means that these data are likely the most visible indicator of
major depression and anxiety disorders among people living
through the financial crisis, as revealed by recent research in
Spain and Greece,” the lead author,  Aaron Reeves , a sociology
researcher at the University of Cambridge in  England , said in an
e-mailed statement.  From 1999 to 2007, the U.S. suicide rate rose each year by
about 0.12 suicides per 100,000 people, the authors wrote. From
2008 to 2010, the rate of increase more than quadrupled, to an
additional 0.51 suicides per 100,000 people, they said.  The U.S. unemployment rate  peaked  at 10 percent in October
2009, and averaged 8.2 percent from 2008 to 2010, according to
data. From 1999 through 2007, joblessness averaged 4.9 percent.  Programs to help the unemployed find jobs, social support
and mental-health programs “seem to mitigate significantly”
the effects of recessions, the researchers wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
