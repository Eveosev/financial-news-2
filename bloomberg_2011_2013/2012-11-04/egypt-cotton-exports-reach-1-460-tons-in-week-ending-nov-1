Egypt  agreed to export 1,460 metric
tons of cotton in the week ending Nov. 1, according to the
Alexandria Cotton Exporters Association.  The country shipped 6,897 tons of the fiber, valued at
$19.8 million, since Sept. 1, the association said today in its
weekly bulletin. Exports in the latest week included 225 tons of
the Giza 88 variety and 1,235 tons of Giza 86, it said.  Egypt produces the worldâ€™s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India 
are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
