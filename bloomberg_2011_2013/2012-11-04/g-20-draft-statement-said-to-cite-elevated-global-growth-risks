A draft of the statement to be issued
by policy makers from the Group of 20 nations described growth
as modest and risks elevated, according to an official from one
of the countries who declined to be identified because the
statement hasn’t been finalized.  Possible delays in Europe’s crisis-fighting plan and the
potential for sharp fiscal tightening in the U.S. and  Japan  were
cited as dangers, as well as weaker growth in some  emerging
markets  and supply shocks for some commodities, the official
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
