Fort Larned gave his jockey a
$270,000 birthday gift by winning the $5 million  Breeders’ Cup
Classic , the richest thoroughbred horse race in  North America .  Jockey Brian Hernandez, who turned 27 years old yesterday,
rode Fort Larned to a half-length victory in the Classic at
Santa Anita Park in Arcadia,  California .  “Fort Larned just gave us the greatest birthday present,”
said Hernandez in a televised interview. “We didn’t think about
the money, just the prestige of winning the race.”  Challenged down the stretch by Mucho Macho Man, Fort Larned
held on to cross the finish line in the 1 ¼-mile race in two
minutes, 0.11 seconds. Flat Out was third.  Hernandez and trainer Ian Wilkes earned their first
Breeders’ Cup victories.  Fort Larned returned $20.80, $9.80 and $6.80 on a $2 bet.
Mucho Macho Man’s second place paid $6.60 and $4.60 and Flat Out
returned $5.20.  Game on Dude, the favorite, finished seventh, giving
trainer  Bob Baffert  a 0-10 record in the Classic. Baffert, who
watched Game on Dude come in second last year to Classic winner
Drosselmeyer, was 0-9 yesterday on the nine-race card.  “He broke a half step slow,” Baffert said of Game on Dude.
“This horse’s only weapon is speed. It was over at the one-
eighth pole and was probably the worst race of his life.”  Course Record  Wise Dan set a course record, covering a mile in one minute,
31.78 seconds and moving into contention for Horse of the Year
honors. Wise Dan beat the record set by Atticus in 1989 in the
$2 million Mile.  Wise Dan paid $5.60, $3 and $2.80 on a $2 bet.  Animal
Kingdom  was second to return $6.60 and $4.60 with Obviously
paying $4.20.  Trinniberg paid $29.40, $13.20 and $11 in winning the $1.5
million Sprint. The Lumber Guy was second to return $6.40 and $5,
while Smiling Tiger was third to pay $12.20.  Little Mike posted a 17-1 upset in the $3 million Turf,
paying $36.60, $12.20 and $7.80. Point of Entry was second to
return $4.20 and $3 and St. Nicholas Abbey was third to pay
$3.80.  Undefeated Shanghai Bobby, with jockey Rosie Napravnik
aboard, held off a late charge from He’s Had Enough to win the
$2 million Juvenile. The winner paid $4.70, $3.40 and $2.60.
He’s Had Enough returned $12.60 and $7.40 and Capo Bastone $5.  Mizdirection, Tapizar  Mizdirection, owned by radio sports talk show host Jim Rome,
won the $1 million Turf Sprint. The winner paid $15.80, $7.40
and $5, followed by Unbridled’s Note, returning $5.80 and $4.40
and Reneesgotzip paying $7.  Tapizar gave jockey Corey Nakatani and trainer Steve Asmussen a victory in the $1 million Dirt Mile. Tapizar paid

$2.60 and $2.10. Dust and Diamonds returned $4.20 and $3.20 for

place and Balance the Books was third to return $6.  During the two-day Breeders’ Cup event, more than $25
