Iran  sold more than 800,000 tons of
 fuel oil  and 50,000 tons of gasoil to vessels navigating in the
Persian Gulf in the first half of the Iranian year started March
20,  Fars  reported, citing an energy official.  National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Co. sold on
average 4 to 6 million liters of fuel oil per day, Managing
Director Jalil Salari was cited as saying in the state-run news
agency’s report.  The quality of Iran’s fuel oil and its strategic position
can help ensure NIOPDC’s success in bunkering, said Salari who
did not elaborate on the company’s revenue from this activity.
The company is engaged in bunkering activity in the  Persian Gulf 
and the Oman Sea, the report said.  Iran, which is under Western-led financial and energy
sanctions over its nuclear program, is one of the main producers
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
