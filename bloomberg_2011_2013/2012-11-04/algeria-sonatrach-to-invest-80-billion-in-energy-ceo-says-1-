Sonatrach,  Algeria ’s state-run energy
group, plans to invest $80 billion in oil and natural gas
projects from 2012 to 2016, Chief Executive Officer Abdelhamid Zerguine said.  The company is committing $14 billion of the amount to
building four refineries, Zerguine said today at a conference in
Algiers. Sonatrach is budgeting $15 billion for investment in
2013, up from $10 billion in 2012, as part of the five-year
plan, he said, without providing further details.  Algeria may not need to import any  fuel oil  next year as
some domestic refineries resume operation, Sonatrach Vice
President for Commerce Yamina Hamdi told reporters separately
today in the capital city.  The North African nation, holder of the continent’s fourth-
largest crude reserves, seeks to revamp its  energy industry  by
attracting foreign investors while curbing a reliance on
imported fuel. The government expects to approve a hydrocarbons
law this year giving greater incentives to international
investors. Algeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, pumped 1.2 million barrels a day of crude
in October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Power consumption in Algeria, the Arab world’s second most-
populous country after  Egypt , will probably reach 80 terawatts
by 2020 and 150 terawatts by 2030, said Noureddine Boutarfa, CEO
of Sonelgaz, the state-run gas and electricity company, speaking
at the same conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
