Brook Lopez scored 27 points to lead
the  Brooklyn  Nets to a 107-100 victory over the Toronto Raptors
as they opened their National Basketball Association season in
the new $1 billion Barclays Center.  “Let’s just start with the fact that we’re in Brooklyn now
and it’s a big difference,” Nets coach Avery Johnson said.
“You saw the crowd tonight, even under the circumstances. Not
only did we have a sellout, they were into the game.”  Elsewhere in the NBA last night, it was the Boston 89,
Washington 86; Indiana 106, Sacramento 98 (2OT); Miami 119,
Denver 116; New Orleans 89, Chicago 82; Portland 95, Houston 85;
Dallas 126,  Charlotte  99; San Antonio 110, Utah 100; Milwaukee
105, Cleveland 102; and Golden State Warriors 114, Los Angeles
Clippers 110.  The Nets were scheduled to open their season Nov. 1 against
the  New York  Knicks. The game was postponed until Nov. 26
because of the destruction and mass transit interruptions caused
by  Hurricane Sandy  last week.  “It was good to finally be out here with the guys because
we’ve been waiting since the last game of last season for this
and just to have it pushed back, it was a little rough for us,”
Lopez said. “Like I said, there are some more important things,
but we were definitely anxious these last few days.”  The Raptors, led by Kyle Lowry’s 28 points, took a first
quarter 35-27 lead over the Nets. Brooklyn rebounded in the
second quarter, outscoring Toronto 33-17 to own a 60-52 halftime
advantage.  Deron Williams  added 19 points for the Nets, who never
lagged in the second half.  DeMar DeRozan scored 25 points for the Raptors, who have
lost the first two games of their season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
