Japanese stock futures fell after
better-than-forecast U.S. payrolls failed to keep commodity
prices from slumping and Americans prepared to elect their
president tomorrow. Australian equities were little changed.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the second-
biggest maker of construction and mining equipment, slid 1.1
percent. Alumina Ltd. advanced 0.5 percent in Sydney as Bank of
America Corp. advised buying shares of the resource producer.
Shares of  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  may be active after the
world’s second-largest carrier by market value posted a worse-
than-estimated 54 percent drop in quarterly profit.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 9,005 in Chicago Nov. 2, down from 9,060 in
Osaka. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,020 in Osaka, at
8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  gained less
than 0.1 percent today and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index retreated
0.2 percent in Wellington.  “The U.S. Election cycle is heading for a conclusion and
that will be a welcome sign for markets,” said George
Boubouras, Melbourne-based head of investment strategy at UBS
AG’s Australian wealth-management unit. The Swiss bank oversees
about $1.5 trillion. “Policy uncertainty, particularly fiscal
and regulatory, has held the market back to date.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed. The  S&P 500  dropped 0.9 percent on Nov. 2 as the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials retreated
1.6 percent, the biggest slide in a month.  U.S. Jobs  Shares declined in the U.S. even after the Labor Department
said a net 171,000 workers were added to payrolls last month and
September’s gain was more than first estimated. The increase
surpassed the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey in
which the median called for an advance of 125,000. Unemployment
rose to 7.9 percent.  With less than forty-eight hours before Election Day,
President  Barack Obama  and opponent  Mitt Romney  are making a
final push to woo voters.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index gained 7.6 percent this year as
central banks in Europe, the U.S., Japan and China added
stimulus measures to counter a global economic slowdown and the
European debt crisis. The index traded at about 13.5 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.6 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.3 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
