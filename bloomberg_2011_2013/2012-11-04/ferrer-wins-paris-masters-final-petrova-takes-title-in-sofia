Spain’s  David Ferrer  beat Poland’s
Jerzy Janowicz to win tennis’s Paris Masters and deny his
opponent a first career title. Nadia Petrova won the Tournament
of Champions in Sofia, Bulgaria.  Ferrer won 6-4, 6-3 to claim an ATP World tour-leading
seventh title of the year and his first in a Masters event. The
30-year-old had previously lost three Masters finals, in Rome in
2010 and Monte Carlo and Shanghai last year.  Janowicz, 21, a 69th-ranked qualifier playing in his first
Masters event, beat five top-20 players this week including
world No. 3  Andy Murray  from Britain.  World No. 5 Ferrer now has 18 career titles following his
most successful season.  In Sofia, Petrova defeated former No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki
6-2, 6-1 for the Russian’s second win in six meetings with the
Dane.  Wozniacki will return to the top 10 of the WTA rankings
after reaching the final. She was top seed for this event, with
Petrova No. 2.  The Tournament of Champions featured the six highest-ranked
players who won a title this season but did not qualify for last
week’s WTA Championships, with two wildcard entries.  Elsewhere, Serena Williams beat her sister Venus 6-3, 6-4
in an exhibition match in Johannesburg. Venus had won a matchup
between the sisters in Lagos, Nigeria, two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
