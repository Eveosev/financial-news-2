Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ,  Australia ’s
second-biggest lender, reported full-year profit that missed
analyst estimates as costs for soured loans rose 22 percent.  Net income  fell 15 percent to A$5.97 billion ($6.19
billion) in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, the Sydney-based
lender said in a stock exchange statement. The median  forecast 
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of
A$6.29 billion. Cash earnings rose 5 percent, the bank said.
Westpac shares increased 1.3 percent to A$25.35 in Sydney today,
while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 0.3 percent.  “The result doesn’t blow the lights out but it doesn’t
need to either,” Peter Esho, chief market analyst at City Index
Ltd. in Sydney, said in an e-mailed note. “Cost control will
become more important in 2013 and unfortunately this probably
means Westpac will further reduce its staff base,” after a 5
percent reduction during the year.  Australian banks are trimming expenses as higher funding
costs squeeze profit margins and fragile consumer and business
confidence weigh on loan demand. Westpac’s net interest margin,
a measure of the profitability of its lending, fell 5 basis
points to 2.17 percent in the 12 months to Sept. 30, it said.  Westpac’s impairment costs rose by A$219 million from a
year earlier, according to the statement. Tax expenses surged 94
percent, with the prior period affected by a one-time tax
benefit from the lender’s takeover of St. George Bank.  Economic Slowdown  “A gradual softening of global economic activity has
continued to weigh on domestic business and  consumer
confidence ,” Westpac said in its statement. “These economic
shifts are part of broader structural changes for the banking
sector which also include significantly increased regulatory
demands and costs.”  Cash earnings, which exclude special items, rose 5 percent
to A$6.6 billion, on revenue that climbed 6 percent, it said.
St. George today reported cash earnings were unchanged at A$1.2
billion.  Shares of Westpac have gained 27 percent this year,
compared with a 10 percent gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200
index.  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  has advanced
23 percent,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia  gained 17 percent and
 National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  rose 6.3 percent.  Westpac will pay a dividend of A$1.66 a share for the year,
up 6 percent from 2011, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
