     Nov. 4 (Bloomberg)-- Boko Haram, the Islamist militant
group fighting to impose strict Islamic rule in  Nigeria , denied
involvement in the killing of one the country’s retired army
generals two days ago.  Suspects shot Muhammadu Shuwa, a retired major general at
his home in Maiduguri, capital of northeastern Borno state,
killing him and one of his guests, Sagir Musa, spokesman for the
Joint Military Task Force in the state, said in a statement to
reporters on Nov. 2. The attackers entered the house as Shuwa
was hosting guests before the Friday prayers and opened fire, he
said. The guest died immediately and Shuwa died on his way to
the hospital, he said.  “We have no hands in the killing of Gen Shuwa,” Mohammed
Ibn Abdulaziz, a spokesman for the group, said by phone today
from Maiduguri. “ We didn’t have problem with the man,” he
said. The attack came a day after Abdulaziz said the group is
ready to start talks with the Nigerian government.  Boko Haram is seeking to impose strict Islamic law on
Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer. Its insurgency began
after its leader,  Mohammed Yusuf , was killed while in police
custody in 2009. Since then the group has carried out attacks in
the mainly Muslim north and the capital, Abuja, that have killed
more than 1,500 people, according to  Human Rights Watch .  To contact the reporter on this story:
