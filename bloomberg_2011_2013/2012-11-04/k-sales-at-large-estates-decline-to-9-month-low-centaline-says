The number of property transactions
recorded at Hong Kong’s 10 largest estates this weekend fell to
the lowest level since January, according to an e-mailed report
from Centaline Property Agency today.  A total of 10 sales were registered, compared with 12 a
week earlier, after the government introduced new measures at
the end of October to curb property prices, Centaline said in
the report.  The government imposed a 15 percent tax on property
purchases by overseas and corporate buyers on Oct. 26 in its
harshest measures yet to control home prices. Hong Kong Chief
Executive Leung Chun-ying has pledged to rein in the real estate
market to stem a three-year surge that has almost doubled prices
in the city.  The tax to deter capital inflows and reduce the risk of a
bubble in the world’s most expensive housing market marks the
third set of curbs since August. Leung has also tightened
mortgage requirements and boosted the supply of land for
developers as the boom triggered protests over a widening wealth
gap.  Monthly sales at the 10 largest estates rose 7.6 percent in
October, Centaline said in a second e-mailed report. Turnover
will probably slow in November and December because of the new
tax, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
