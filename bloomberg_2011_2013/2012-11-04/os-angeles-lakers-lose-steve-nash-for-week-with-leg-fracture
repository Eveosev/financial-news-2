The  Los Angeles Lakers , who are
winless in three starts this season, have lost guard  Steve Nash 
for at least a week with a leg fracture, the National Basketball
Association team reported.  Nash, 38, had an MRI yesterday that showed a small non-
displaced fracture in the head of his left leg, the team said on
its website. The Lakers originally said he bruised his leg.  Nash got hurt in a collision with Portland Trail Blazer
rookie Damian Lillard in the second quarter of the Lakers’ 116-
106 loss. Nash tried to play in the second half, but was forced
to leave the court.  Steve Blake, Nash’s backup, had two assists, three
turnovers and eight points in 39 minutes in the Lakers’ 105-95
loss to the  Los Angeles Clippers  on Nov. 2.  The Lakers, who are off to their worst start in 34 years,
host the Detroit Pistons tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
