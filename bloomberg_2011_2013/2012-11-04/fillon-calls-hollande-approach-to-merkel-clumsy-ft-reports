Former French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said that President Francois Hollande’s handling of
relations with German Chancellor Angela Merkel is “clumsy,”
the Financial Times reported in an interview.  “Relations between  France  and  Germany  are being damaged
because there is too great a divergence between the economic
policy of France and the policy of Germany,” Fillon was quoted
as saying by the Financial Times in an interview.  Hollande acts as if Merkel has already lost next year’s
election, Fillon said. “He thinks he is attacking Ms Merkel but
Germans take it as an attack on Germany as a whole,” Fillon
said.  Fillon is vying for the leadership of France’s main
oppostion UMP party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
