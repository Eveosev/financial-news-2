Queens Park Rangers and Reading are
both still looking for a first win this season in English
soccer’s Premier League after a 1-1 tie at Loftus Road today.  Kaspars Gorkss gave visiting Reading a halftime lead, with
Djibril Cisse replying for the Hoops after 66 minutes.  QPR moves off the bottom of the standings, ahead of
Southampton because of a superior goal difference. Both teams
have four points, although QPR has played one more match.
Reading is 18th on five points.  Liverpool hosts Newcastle in today’s other game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
