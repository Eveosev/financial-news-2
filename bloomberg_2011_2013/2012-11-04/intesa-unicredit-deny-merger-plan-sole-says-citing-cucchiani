Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  Chief Executive
Officer Enrico Cucchiani and UniCredit CEO Federico Ghizzoni
denied any plan to combine Italy’s two biggest banks, Il Sole 24
Ore reported today, citing the two executives.  Press reports about such a merger are “much ado about
nothing,” Cucchiani said, according to Il Sole. Ghizzoni said:
“Please, let’s talk about serious and real things,” Il Sole
reported.  Il Messaggero  said Claudio Costamagna, a former Goldman
Sachs Group banker, met with Ghizzoni in recent days to propose
the “idea” of a combination between the two lenders.
Costamagna was probably backed by Intesa’s Chairman Giovanni Bazoli, Messaggero said, citing an unnamed adviser for
UniCredit. Ghizzoni wasn’t interested in a deal and didn’t want
to start any discussion, Messaggero said.  A UniCredit official said yesterday the reports of a merger
between the two banks are fiction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
