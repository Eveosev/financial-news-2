Everett Golson plunged one yard for
the winning touchdown in the third overtime of the  University of
Notre Dame ’s 29-26 victory over the  University of Pittsburgh  in
college football.  The No. 3 Fighting Irish, rallying from a 20-6 deficit to
tie the game at 20-20, extended their winning streak to nine
straight, the best start since 1993.  “We played a very good team today,” said Notre Dame coach
 Brian Kelly  in a televised interview. “Pittsburgh played their
butts off.”  In games involving other Top 10 in the Bowl Championship
Series rankings, it was No. 1 Alabama 21, No. 5 Louisiana State
17; No. 2 Kansas State 44, No. 24 Oklahoma State 30; No. 4
Oregon 62, No. 17 Southern California 51; No. 6 Georgia 37,
Mississippi 10; No. 7 Florida 14, Missouri 7; and No. 10
Louisville 45, Temple 17.  Golson, who completed 23 of 42 passing attempts for 227
yards, connected with T.J. Jones on an 11-yard touchdown pass to
bring Notre Dame within 20-12 at the start of the fourth
quarter. He then hit Theo Riddick on a 5-yard throw and rushed
for a two-point conversion with two minutes, 11 seconds left to
tie the game at  Notre Dame  Stadium.  Kevin Harper, who kicked two field goals during regulation
time, gave the Panthers (4-5) a 23-20 lead with a 41-yard kick
in the first overtime. Kyle Brindza, who also had two for Notre
Dame, countered with a 37-yard field goal to tie the game at
23-23.  Pittsburgh’s Jarred Holley recovered a fumble by Cierre
Wood in the endzone, depriving the Fighting Irish of a touchdown
in the second overtime. Harper, with the chance to give
Pittsburgh the victory, missed a 33-yard field goal after a high
snap to end the period.  Harper came back in the third overtime to give the Panthers
a 26-23 lead on a 44-yard field goal until Golson scored a
touchdown on a quarterback sneak.  “We overcame some uncharacteristic mistakes,” Kelly said.
“Last year, that would have been a loss. But our team kept
fighting, kept playing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
