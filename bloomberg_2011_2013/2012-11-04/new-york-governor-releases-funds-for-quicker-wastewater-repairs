New York  state released $22.8 million
in funds so New York City can more quickly repair wastewater
treatment facilities damaged during  Hurricane Sandy .  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said today in a statement
that the money was released by the state from an escrow account
funded by New York City under terms of agreements with the state
Department of Environmental Conservation for past violations at
the city’s wastewater treatment facilities.  “With the release of these funds, New York City will be
better able to continue to repair damaged wastewater facilities
and help address the threat to public health and the environment
caused by Hurricane Sandy,” the governor said.  New York City is already treating wastewater at 13 of its
14 plants after “major repairs” to the sewage facilities after
the storm, city Department of Environmental Protection
Commissioner Carter Strickland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
