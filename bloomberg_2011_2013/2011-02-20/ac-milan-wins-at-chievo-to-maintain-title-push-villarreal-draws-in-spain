  Lionel Messi  scored the winning goal
with 13 minutes remaining as  Barcelona  beat Athletic Bilbao 2-1
to restore its five-point lead over Real  Madrid  atop Spanish
soccer’s La Liga.  Messi, the World Player of the Year, sealed the victory
with his 25th league goal of the season last night after Andoni
Iraola’s penalty had canceled out David Villa’s third-minute
opener at Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium.  “We couldn’t afford another slip-up as Real Madrid were
close,” Messi was cited as saying by Agence France-Presse.
“There isn’t that much left of the league to go now and every
game is vital.”  Real Madrid had moved to within two points of the lead two
days ago as goals from Karim Benzema and  Ricardo Carvalho  sealed
a 2-0 home win over Levante. Barcelona has 65 points to Real’s
60 with 14 games left.  Villarreal is in fourth place with 46 points, two behind
Valencia, after a 1-1 draw with Malaga yesterday. Valencia drew
0-0 with Sporting Gijon two days ago.  In Italy, AC Milan maintained its grip on first place in
Serie A with a 2-1 victory at Chievo yesterday as Alexandre Pato
got the winning goal in the 82nd minute.  Robinho put Milan ahead midway through the first half, with
Gelson Fernandes leveling for Chievo in the 62nd minute. The
home team’s Bostjan Cesar was dismissed for a second yellow card
six minutes from the end.  Napoli overtook defending champion Inter Milan in second
place after a 1-0 win over Catania in yesterday’s late game. AC
Milan leads with 55 points, three ahead of Napoli, with Inter
two points further back.  Ranieri Resigns  Roma coach Claudio Ranieri resigned after his team let slip
a 3-0 lead before losing 4-3 at Genoa,  Agence France-Presse 
reported. Roma’s fourth straight loss left it in eighth place.  “I’ve always thought about the good of Roma and after a
game such as today’s I believe it’s right to give a signal,”
Ranieri was cited as saying by Italian news agency Ansa. “After
the final whistle I went into the changing rooms to thank the
team and I decided to hand in my resignation.”  In  Germany , second-place  Bayer Leverkusen  stays 10 points
behind  Borussia Dortmund  after a 4-2 win against Stuttgart
yesterday. Dortmund beat St. Pauli 2-0, while Bayern Munich won
3-1 at Mainz. Dortmund has 55 points, Leverkusen 45 and  Bayern
Munich  42.  In France, leader Lille lost 1-0 at Montpellier yesterday
and has a two-point advantage over Rennes, which moved ahead of
Marseille in second place by beating Toulouse 2-1 last night.  In the  Netherlands , leader  PSV Eindhoven , a 4-1 winner over
NAC Breda, pulled two points clear of FC Twente, which drew 1-1
with NEC Nijmegen.  Gary Hooper scored twice and Kris Commons got the third
goal as Celtic had a 3-0 home win over champion Rangers to go
eight points clear of its Glasgow rival in the Scottish Premier
League. Rangers have played two fewer games.  WEEKEND RESULTS  Italy : Bologna 1-0 Palermo; Inter Milan 1-0
