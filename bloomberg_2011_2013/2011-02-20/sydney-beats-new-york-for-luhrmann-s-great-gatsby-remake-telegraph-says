     Feb. 20 (Bloomberg) --Baz Luhrmann has signed a deal to
shoot his remake of ‘The Great Gatsby’ with  Leonardo DiCaprio  in
the title role in Sydney, the Sunday Telegraph reported, without
saying where it got the information.                       The
director of ‘Romeo + Juliet’ and the state government of New
South Wales signed a production deal on Friday, the paper
reported. Premier Kristina Keneally said the film will inject
more than A$120 million into the state’s economy and comes at a
good time for the nation’s movie industry, which has been dented
by the stronger Australian dollar, the paper said.  DiCaprio, who worked with Luhrmann 15 years ago in ‘Romeo +
Juliet,’ will reprise the role made famous by Robert Redford,
the paper reported. Sydney was chosen over  New York  and  Europe ,
the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
