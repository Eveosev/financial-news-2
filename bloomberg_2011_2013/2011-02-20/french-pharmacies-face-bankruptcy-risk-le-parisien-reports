French pharmacy sales are falling
after a government effort to rein in healthcare costs, and 24
percent of  France ’s 22,259 pharmacies are at a “strong risk”
of bankruptcy in 2011, Le Parisien  reported , citing estimates by
credit-insurance company Coface.  France on average has one pharmacy for every 2,849
inhabitants, and 126 pharmacies went out of business last year,
according to the newspaper. The number of pharmacy bankruptcies
in 2010 was three times that in 2006, Le Parisien said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
