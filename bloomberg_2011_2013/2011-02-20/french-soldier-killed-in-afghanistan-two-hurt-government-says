A French soldier was killed and two
were injured after their armored vehicle was attacked by

weapon, the French government said.  The attack happened during an operation in the Alasay
valley in Kapisa province in northeast Afghanistan, the French
government said in e-mailed statements today. Of the two wounded
soldiers, one was “gravely hurt” and evacuated to Paris, while
another was “more lightly injured” and treated on location,
the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
