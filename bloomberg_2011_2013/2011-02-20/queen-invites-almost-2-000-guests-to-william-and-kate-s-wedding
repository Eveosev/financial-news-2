About 1,900 guests have been invited
by  Queen Elizabeth II  to the wedding service in Westminster
Abbey of her grandson  Prince William  and Kate Middleton.  The congregation will gather in  London  on April 29 to
witness the couple exchange their marriage vows, with more than
half those attending drawn from their family and friends, St
James’s Palace said in an e-mailed statement today.  While the guests were not identified, they are likely to
include heads of state, royalty from across the world, leading
lawmakers and celebrities.  Prince William and Kate Middleton’s engagement was
announced on Nov. 16, ending years of speculation about a
possible royal marriage. William, 28, the son of Prince Charles
and second in line to the British throne, had been dating
Middleton, 29, since 2003. Their wedding day will be a U.K.
public holiday.  Among those to have received wedding invitations, which
were sent out last week, are representatives of William’s
charities and members of the government, defense services and
church.  Of the 1,900 guests, about 600 have been invited to a
lunchtime reception at  Buckingham Palace  given by William’s
grandmother, with 300 invited to a dinner at the palace hosted
by his father, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
