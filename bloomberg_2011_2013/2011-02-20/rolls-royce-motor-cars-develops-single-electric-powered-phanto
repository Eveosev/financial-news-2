  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ’s Rolls-
Royce Motor Cars unit said it’s developing a single vehicle from
its Phantom model series that’s fully powered by electricity.  The car will debut at the  Geneva Motor Show  on March 1 and
will tour this year as the company collects data that “will be
crucial in informing future decisions on alternative drive-
trains for Rolls-Royce Motor cars,” BMW said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
