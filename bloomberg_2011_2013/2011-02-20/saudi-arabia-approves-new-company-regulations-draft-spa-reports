  Saudi Arabia ’s Shoura Council passed
a draft of new company regulations outlining rules to start, run
and close companies in the Arab world’s largest economy, the
 Saudi Press Agency  reported.  The draft, which replaces rules issued in 1965, stipulates
that the number of partners in a limited liabilities company
should not exceed 50, otherwise it should turn into a joint
stock company within a year, the news service said.  A pending article obliging joint stock company boards not
to get more than 10 percent of a company’s net income in bonus
payments will be discussed by officials later, SPA said, citing
the council’s secretary-general Mohammed Bin Abdullah Al Ghamdi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
