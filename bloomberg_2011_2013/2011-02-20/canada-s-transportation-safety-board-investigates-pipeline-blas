Canada’s Transportation Safety Board 
is investigating a pipeline explosion and fire in northeastern
Ontario.  The blast occurred near Beardmore, Ontario, just after
midnight local time, said John Cottreau, a spokesman for the
Transportation Safety Board. An investigator is expected to be
at the site, about 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of Thunder
Bay, Ontario, by midafternoon today, he said.  The fire is under control and the investigation won’t start
until it is entirely out, Cottreau said. The owner of the
pipeline hasn’t been identified, he said.  The blast caused the partial evacuation of the town of
about 440 and the closure of the TransCanada highway, according
to a CTV report. The residents, who left voluntarily, were
allowed back a few hours later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
