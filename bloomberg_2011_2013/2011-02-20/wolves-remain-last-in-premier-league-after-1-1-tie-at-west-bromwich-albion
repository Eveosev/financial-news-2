Wolverhampton Wanderers remain
bottom in English soccer’s Premier League after an injury-time
goal from West Bromwich Albion’s Carlos Vela in a 1-1 tie at the
Hawthorns.  Wolves appeared set for only a second away win this season
after Jamie O’Hara, on loan from Tottenham, put the visitors
ahead after 39 minutes. Vela, on loan from Arsenal, then struck
late for West Brom.  Wolves have 25 points, behind West Ham on goal difference,
with Wigan on 27 points completing the relegation positions.
West Brom has 28 points, with Blackpool one point further ahead.  O’Hara scored his first Wolves goal after Nenad Milijas
squared the ball to the midfielder from a free kick. His 25-
yard-shot curled past goalkeeper Boaz Myhill into the top of the
net.  With time running out, Vela scored from a rebound when
Wayne Hennessey spilled a shot from James Morrison.  Today’s was the only league match this weekend, with many
teams involved in the F.A. Cup. Blackpool hosts Tottenham in two
days as it looks to move clear of the relegation zone.    Manchester United  leads the standings with 57 points, four
ahead of Arsenal.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Cone  in  London  at
