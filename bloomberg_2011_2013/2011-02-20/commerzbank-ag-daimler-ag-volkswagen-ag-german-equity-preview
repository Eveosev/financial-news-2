German stocks retreated, after a
four-week rally left the  DAX Index  trading at the highest level
since January 2008, as political unrest in the Middle East
intensified.    BASF SE  and Bayer AG led a retreat in European chemical
shares, both falling more than 2 percent.  ProSiebenSat.1 Media

price forecast on the stock.  Merck KGaA  advanced 4.5 percent

through rising oil prices,” said Andreas Lipkow, an equity
trader at  MWB Fairtrade Wertpapierhandelsbank AG  in Frankfurt.
“Investors are very cautious and nervous about the situation.”  In Libya, holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves, clashes
between protesters and security forces have left more than 200
people dead in the past week, according to Human Rights Watch.
The unrest followed popular uprisings that led to the toppling
of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egypt’s Hosni
Mubarak this year. Demonstrators have also taken to the streets
in Bahrain, Yemen, Morocco and Iran.  Stocks extended their losses after Muammar Qaddafi’s son
called on protesters in Libya to begin a dialogue or face a
civil war, risking the country’s oil wealth.  “Instead of weeping over 84 dead people, we will weep over
hundreds of thousands of dead,” Saif al-Islam Qaddafi said on
state television. “Rivers of blood will flow.”  BASF, K+S  BASF, the world’s biggest chemicals maker, slid 2.7 percent

today.  ProSiebenSat.1 Media slid 3.4 percent to 22.70 euros, the
lowest price this month, as Goldman Sachs cut its price estimate
for Germany’s biggest private broadcaster by 10 percent to 29.30
euros.  Merck  Merck jumped 4.5 percent to 65.50 euros, the biggest

of 1.49 euros from 16 analysts surveyed within the past 28 days
by Bloomberg.  A report today showed Germany’s business confidence
unexpectedly rose to a record in February. The Munich-based Ifo
institute said its business climate index, based on a survey of
7,000 executives, increased to 111.2 from 110.3 in January.

in 1991. Economists predicted the index would hold steady,
according to the median of 38 forecasts in Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
