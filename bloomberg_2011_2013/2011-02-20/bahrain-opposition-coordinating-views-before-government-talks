Seven Bahraini opposition groups,
including al-Wefaq, will hold further talks to decide how to
coordinate a response to a government call for dialogue, Ebrahim
Sharif, head of the National Democratic Action Society, said
today in an interview.  The political groups met after military personnel and riot
police withdrew from Pearl Roundabout and other areas of the
capital Manama yesterday following a standoff with protesters.  Al-Wefaq, the largest Shiite opposition bloc in parliament,
said yesterday it wouldn’t hold talks with the Crown Prince
until the government removed its forces from the streets and
allowed peaceful protests.  “We want to continue further discussions among ourselves
and others,” Sharif said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
