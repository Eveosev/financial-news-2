  Manchester United  is planning a 35
million-pound ($57 million) bid for Tottenham’s Luka Modric as a
replacement for  Paul Scholes , the News of the World reported.  United manager  Alex Ferguson  also wants to add Sunderland’s
Jordan Henderson and Everton’s Jack Rodwell to his midfield, the
newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Ferguson sees the 25-year-old Modric as the ideal player to
replace Scholes, 36, the News of the World said. United may
offer Michael Carrick in part-exchange, the newspaper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
