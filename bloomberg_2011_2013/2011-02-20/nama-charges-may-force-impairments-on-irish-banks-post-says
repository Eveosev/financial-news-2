Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency, set up in 2009 to purge Irish banks of risky commercial
real-estate loans, may record a “significant” impairment
charge on purchased loans that could force lenders to take
similar costs, the Sunday Business Post said.  NAMA will probably have to write down the value of loans
acquired from lenders in its 2010 accounts after the Irish  property market  deteriorated further, the newspaper said. NAMA
purchased the loans from banks in part with subordinated bonds
that pay coupons reliant on the performance of the acquired
loans, the newspaper said.  NAMA has informed banks it won’t pay the coupon on the
bonds, which may force them to book charges, according to the
newspaper. Bank of Ireland said last week it is taking a 70
million euro charge ($96 million), the newspaper said. It didn’t
name other lenders.  NAMA has also bought loans from  Allied Irish Banks Plc ,
Anglo Irish Bank Corp., EBS Building Society, and Irish  Nationwide Building Society . A spokesman for NAMA wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
