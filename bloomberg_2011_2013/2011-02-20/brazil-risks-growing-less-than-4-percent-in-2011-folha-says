  Brazil  is at risk of growing less
than 4 percent this year because of faster inflation and
instability in the international economy, newspaper Folha de
S.Paulo  reported , citing unidentified advisers of President  Dilma Rousseff .  Rousseff is seeking to avoid the economy cooling below that
level and also to have inflation not exceed 6 percent, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said. The most likely government scenario
by year-end is for 5.5 percent inflation and 4.5 percent
economic growth, which is less than the official forecast of
5 percent expansion, Folha said.  The Brazilian president decided to hold off on new currency
and credit-curb measures in the first months of her
administration to avoid slowing the economy more than necessary,
Folha says. She has scheduled a meeting next month to reassess
the outlook, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
