The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations increased 5.31 cents to
$3.1791 a gallon, according to a survey.  The price covers the two-week period ended Feb. 18 and is
derived from data provided by 2,500 filling stations nationwide
to  Trilby Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst in
Camarillo,  California .  “Wholesale gasoline prices moved up more than that,
crimping retailers’ margins,” Lundberg said. “This alone
indicates they will have to recover some of that, which will
cause retail prices to move upwards by some amount in the very
near future.”  The front-month crude oil contract dropped $2.83, or 3.2
percent, in the two weeks, settling at $86.20 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Crude oil may increase next week as mounting Middle East
tensions bolster the risk of a disruption of shipments from the
region, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Twenty of 46 analysts, or 43 percent, forecast crude oil
will rise through Feb. 25. Fifteen respondents, or 33 percent,
predicted prices will decline and 11 estimated little change.
Last week, 48 percent said futures would decrease.  Oil Supplies  U.S. crude-oil supplies rose 860,000 barrels to 345.9
million in the week ended Feb. 11, according to an Energy
Department report on Feb. 16.  Crude inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for New York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil, climbed 250,000
barrels to 37.7 million. The front-month Brent crude contract
closed at $102.52 a barrel Feb. 18, compared with $99.25 two
weeks earlier.  While there is a glut of U.S. West Texas Intermediate,
refiners use a slate of crudes from around the world where
prices are higher, Lundberg said. The current New York contract
expires Feb. 22. The April contract rose 87 cents to $89.71 a
barrel April 18. U.S. financial markets will be closed tomorrow
for the Presidents Day holiday.  “Refiners are paying more for crude than it would
appear,” Lundberg said. “Other crudes used by U.S. refiners,
especially some crudes of similar and higher quality, have been
far more sensitive to tensions in the Middle East region and
North Africa as well.”  Gasoline for front-month delivery gained 4.8 percent to
settle at $2.5513 a gallon in the two weeks ended Feb. 18.  Gasoline Stockpiles  U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose 205,000 barrels to 241.1
million barrels in the week ended Feb. 11, according to the
Energy Department. Gasoline demand, measured by deliveries to
wholesalers, rose 3.4 percent to 8.81 million barrels a day.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline averaged $3.40 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.50 a
gallon.  The highest price in the continental U.S. was in  San
Francisco , at about $3.54 a gallon. The lowest price was in
Billings,  Montana , where a gallon averaged $2.95, Lundberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
