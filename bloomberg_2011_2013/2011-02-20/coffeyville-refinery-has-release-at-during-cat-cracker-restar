  CVR Energy Inc . had a release of
hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide during the restart of a
fluid catalytic cracker at its Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery
yesterday, according to a filing with the National Response
Center.  The incident happened at 6:55 p.m. local time, the report
said.  U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,

information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
