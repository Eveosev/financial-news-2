Taiwan will allow Chinese investors
to take stakes in local semiconductor and flat-panel companies,
the Economic Daily News reported, without saying where it got
the information. Chinese investors will be able to buy up to 10
percent of an existing Taiwan panel or chip company, with a 50
percent limit on stakes in new ventures, the newspaper said. The
new rules will be finalized this week and announced within a few
days by the economics ministry, it reported.         To contact the reporter on this story:
