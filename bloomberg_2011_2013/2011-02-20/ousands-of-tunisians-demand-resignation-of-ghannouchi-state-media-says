More than 3,000 protesters rallied
in central Tunis to demand the resignation of Prime Minister
Mohammed Ghannouchi, state-run  Tunis Afrique Presse  reported.  Soldiers fired rounds in the air today to disperse the
demonstrators, who were assembled in front of the governmentâ€™s
main offices, the Tunis-based TAP said. There were no immediate
reports of injuries.  Mass protests in  Tunisia  forced the ouster of President
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January, the first Arab
country to see an autocrat toppled by street opposition. The
uprising has inspired demonstrations throughout the region,
leading to the Feb. 11 overthrow of Egyptian president  Hosni Mubarak .  In Tunisia, a transitional government led by Ghannouchi,
who served as prime minister under Ben Ali, is running the
country with the aim of organizing a transition toward elected
institutions. Protesters repeatedly have called for the
dismissal of ministers who were part of the previous government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
