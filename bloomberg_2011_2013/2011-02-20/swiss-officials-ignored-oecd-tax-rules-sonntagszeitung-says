Swiss officials failed to inform
Finance Minister Evaline Widmer-Schlumpf that the country’s
rules for exchanging tax data with foreign governments did not
meet international standards, SonntagsZeitung reported.  Widmer-Schlumpf revised arrangements for “administrative
assistance” to other nations two weeks ago to avoid possible
penalties by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, the Swiss newspaper said, citing unnamed sources.
Advisers had known for over a year that  Switzerland ’s
regulations did not comply with OECD rules, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
