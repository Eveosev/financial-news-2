A disruption of supplies as a result
of civil unrest in Libya may lead to a further reduction in the
price difference between  Brent crude  and West Texas Intermediate
oil, according to Switzerland-based researcher Petromatrix GmbH.  “If a real supply disruption develops in Libya in our
opinion it does not matter which benchmark better represents the
world supply and demand,” Petromatrix Managing Director  Olivier Jakob  said in a note today. “The U.S. investment flows that
will want to hedge against an oil price spike will come into WTI
and despite the contango issue in Cushing, this could force a
further reduction in the Brent premium to WTI.”  The spread between London-traded Brent and WTI on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  narrowed to less than $10 a barrel,
after reaching a record of $16.51 on Feb. 17, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The difference had grown amid rising inventories at
Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for Nymex. A market is in
contango when supplies for nearby delivery trade at a lower
price than shipments for subsequent months, making storage of
oil for later sale more attractive.  To contact the reporters on this story:
