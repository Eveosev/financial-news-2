Tens of demonstrators protested in
front of the Egyptian stock exchange today, asking for trades
made on Jan. 26 and Jan. 27 to be canceled, the state-run Middle
East News Agency reported.  The stock market lost 70 billion Egyptian pounds of its
value on those two days, the Cairo-based news agency said.  Trading has been suspended since the close on Jan. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
