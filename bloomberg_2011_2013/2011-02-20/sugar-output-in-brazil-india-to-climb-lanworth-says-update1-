Sugar production in  Brazil  and India,
the largest producers, will climb as farmers increase crop area,
according to researcher Lanworth Inc.  Brazil’s output will increase 5.1 percent to 35.2 million
metric tons in the 2011-2012 season, while production in India
may jump 24.4 percent to 25.5 million tons in the year to Sept.
30, Nick Kouchoukos, vice president at the Chicago-based natural
resources research company, told a conference in Dubai today.  Lanworth’s forecast for India compares with 25 million tons
predicted by the Indian Sugar Mills Association. Higher Indian
production will be driven by an expansion in area in Maharashtra
and  Uttar Pradesh , which together account for about two-thirds
of the nation’s total output, Kouchoukos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
