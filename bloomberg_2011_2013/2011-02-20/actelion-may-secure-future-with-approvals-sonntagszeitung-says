  Actelion Ltd . has the chance to
secure its fortunes for the next two decades if new drugs are
tested successfully this year, SonntagsZeitung reported, citing
an interview with Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Clozel.  Actelion has three drugs in the third, final development
phase and another five in the second phase, the report said.  “In the best scenario, Actelion’s next 15 to 20 years will
be guaranteed by the end of this year,” the Swiss newspaper
quoted Clozel as saying.  Medicines under development include treatments for multiple
sclerosis and cystic fibrosis, the paper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
