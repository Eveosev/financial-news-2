  Woodside Petroleum Ltd .,  Australia ’s
second-largest oil and gas producer, said 2010 profit rose 7
percent because of higher prices and record output and sales at
its North West Shelf natural gas project.  Net income climbed to $1.58 billion from $1.47 billion in
2009, Perth-based Woodside said today in a statement to the
Australian stock exchange. That matches the $1.58 billion median
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Woodside, Chevron Corp. and BG Group Plc are among energy
companies developing Australian liquefied natural gas projects
to tap increasing Asian demand for the fuel. Woodside said in
November that its Pluto venture will cost A$900 million ($913
million) more and start about six months later than it
previously projected.  “This is a solid, but not necessarily stunning set of
results,”  Xavier Grunauer , an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.
in Sydney, said by phone. “But sometimes a solid set of results
is just what the market needs. I think this will be seen as
neutral to slightly positive, and sets the stage for progress
over the next two or three months with regard to Pluto.”  Woodside rose 0.4 percent to A$42.90 at 10:47 a.m. in
Sydney trading, compared with a drop of 0.5 percent for the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  Search for Gas  The Pluto project is expected to cost A$14 billion and to
be ready to start in August, with first exports due a month
later, the company reiterated today. Woodside, drilling to find
gas reserves to underpin an expansion of the Pluto development,
aims to have a second LNG processing unit ready to begin by the
end of 2014, according to a Jan. 21 statement.  The exploration campaign to underpin a Pluto expansion will
continue this year, as will discussions with other gas suppliers
to feed the project, Woodside said today.  Sales climbed 20 percent to $4.19 billion, even as
production declined 10 percent to 72.7 million barrels of oil
equivalent, Woodside said. Output dropped after the sale of the
Otway gas assets and because of aging fields, it said.  Chief Executive Officer Don Voelte, 58, plans to step down
in the second half of this year after the Pluto venture begins
production, Woodside said in October. The Australian explorer is
considering executives inside and outside the company as
possible successors to Voelte, who joined in April 2004.  Woodside declared a final dividend of 55 cents a share, up
from 49 cents a year earlier.  The Browse LNG venture in  Western Australia  remains on
schedule to be ready for a final  investment decision  by
mid-2012, Woodside said Jan. 21. Woodside today reiterated its
expectation for 2011 production of 63 million to 66 million
barrels of oil equivalent, excluding Pluto.  Only  BHP Billiton Ltd . has higher oil and gas output than
Woodside among Australian producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Paton  in Sydney   jpaton4@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
