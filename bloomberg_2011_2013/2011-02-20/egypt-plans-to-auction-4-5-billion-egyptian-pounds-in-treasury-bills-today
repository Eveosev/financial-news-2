Egypt, reeling under labor strikes
and bank disruptions after a revolt ousted President  Hosni Mubarak , plans to sell 10 billion Egyptian pounds ($1.7 billion)
of treasury bills this week.  The Ministry of Finance will offer 1 billion pounds of 91-
day bills and 3.5 billion pounds of 273-day notes at an auction
today, according to data posted on its  website . The ministry
will also auction 2 billion pounds of 182-day securities and 3.5
billion pounds of 364-day bills on Feb. 21, it said.  The protests that led to the Feb. 11 ouster of Mubarak
shuttered businesses, scared off tourists and raised the
government’s borrowing costs to the highest level in two years.
Egypt’s Finance Minister Samir Radwan said on Feb. 14 the  budget
deficit  will widen to about 8.4 percent of gross domestic
product in the current fiscal year ending June from 8.1 percent
as spending increases and economic growth slows after Mubarak’s
fall.  The turmoil has forced banks to close and sent the currency
skidding to a six-year low. Banks will open today, state-run
television reported on Feb. 18, while the stock market, shut
since Jan. 30 at the height of the anti-Mubarak demonstrations,
remains closed. Economic growth may slow to 4 percent from 5.1
percent in the previous year, Radwan said on Feb. 12.  Preventing Strikes  The Ministry of Finance sold a combined 6.5 billion pounds
of 91-day and nine-month bills on Feb. 13. The average yield on
the nine-month securities rose to 11.68 percent, the highest in
two years, from 11.66 percent at the previous sale, according to
central bank data on Bloomberg.    Egypt ’s Supreme Council of the Armed Forces dissolved
parliament and suspended the constitution, saying it will rule
for six months or until elections are held. The military council
said that it won’t allow strikes to continue because of their
impact on the economy, state-run television reported on Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
