  Egypt  raised 5.5 billion pounds
($934 million) from the sale of treasury bills today, with the
yield on one-year notes rising to a more than two-year high as
unrest escalated in the Middle East and North Africa.  The Ministry of Finance sold 3.5 billion pounds of 364-day
bills at an average yield of 12 percent, the highest since
November 2008, compared with 10.6 percent when the tenor was
auctioned on Jan. 25, according to central bank data on
Bloomberg. Two billion pounds of 182-day notes were sold at an
average yield of 11.73 percent from 11.78 percent last week, the
data show.  The demonstrations that led to the Feb. 11 ouster of former
President  Hosni Mubarak  have deterred investors and raised the
government’s borrowing costs. Unrest has spread to Libya,
Bahrain and Yemen, sending stocks in the region lower. The
Bloomberg GCC 200 index of Gulf stocks has dropped 5.3 percent
in the past seven days.  The government yesterday sold 1 billion pounds of 91-day
bills at an average yield of 10.94 percent, little changed from
last week’s auction, the country’s first debt sale after the
resignation of Mubarak, according to central bank data on
Bloomberg.  Egypt’s stock exchange hasn’t decided when to resume
trading and hasn’t found any legal grounds to cancel trades that
took place on Jan. 27, the last day stocks traded, Chairman
Khaled Seyam said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
