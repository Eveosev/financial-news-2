Phones 4U Ltd., the U.K. phone
retail chain, may be sold for about 700 million pounds ($1.1
billion) to London-based private equity firm  BC Partners  Ltd.,
the  Sunday Times  reported, without saying where it got the

buyout firm that owns Phones 4U, with a better offer after talks
between the two companies were halted before Christmas, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
