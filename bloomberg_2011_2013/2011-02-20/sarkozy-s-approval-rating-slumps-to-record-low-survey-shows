French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
popularity fell to a record amid criticism of his government’s
handling of the crises in Tunisia and  Egypt , a survey for the
daily  Liberation  showed.  Sarkozy’s approval rating fell 4 percentage points to 30
percent this month, the lowest since the start of his presidency
in 2007, while 66 percent of respondents said they disapproved
of his policies, according to the survey by  Viavoice .  France’s opposition has criticized the government for being
slow to drop support for ousted Tunisian President Zine El
Abidine Ben Ali, who fled his country Jan. 14. Foreign Minister
Michele Alliot-Marie has faced calls to resign after suggesting
in parliament on Jan. 12 that  France  could offer Tunisia police
expertise on non-lethal crowd control and for accepting two
rides in a jet owned by a supporter of Ben Ali.  Prime Minister Francois Fillon’s popularity declined 6
points to 41 percent, and 54 percent said they disapproved of
him, compared with 47 percent in November.  International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  continued to be the most popular politician among
opposition parties, the poll showed. Strauss-Kahn’s popularity
was stable at 54 percent, leading other potential Socialist
candidates for the 2012 presidential race, including  Martine Aubry , Francois Hollande and Segolene Royal.  Paris-based Viavoice telephoned 1,010 respondents aged 18
and older on Feb. 17 and Feb. 18, according to the poll. It
didn’t publish a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
