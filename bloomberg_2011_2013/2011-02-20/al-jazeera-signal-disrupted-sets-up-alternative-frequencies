  Al Jazeera  Network, the Qatar-based
television news network, said it set up alternative frequencies
for viewers after its broadcasts were disrupted across the
Middle East and North Africa.  Viewers on Arabsat and Nilesat have been affected by the
disruptions, the news network said in an e-mailed statement
today. Those responsible for the interference are believed to be
operating “sophisticated and large” equipment and cooperation
from governments would be required to determine the source of
the problem, Al Jazeera said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Robert Tuttle  in Doha at
