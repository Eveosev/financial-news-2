The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission
said it will cost $20 million to come up with a broadly
acceptable registry of voters, a critical step in determining
when new elections are held, the state-controlled Sunday Mail
said.  The commission is working on cleaning up the voters’ roll,
after which constituency boundaries would be drawn up for
elections, the Sunday Mail reported, citing the electoral body’s
chairman Simpson Mutambanengwe.  Mutambanengwe wouldn’t say whether elections will be held
in 2011, the Harare-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
