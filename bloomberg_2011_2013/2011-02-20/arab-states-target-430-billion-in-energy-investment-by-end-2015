Arab oil and gas producers are
seeking $430 billion in new investment from 2011 through 2015 to
maintain output and meet expected demand as governments resume
projects they delayed due to the financial crisis.  A recovery in consumption and higher crude prices will
encourage investors to help revive some oil-related facilities
and projects and to develop new ones, the  Arab Petroleum
Investments Corp. , known as Apicorp, said in its annual review
of Arab energy investment released today. Apicorp is an  investment company  owned by the  Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries .  Arab producers are planning projects valued at $530 billion
over the five-year period, and they need $430 billion in
financing and investment beyond the amount they have already
committed, Apicorp said.  Cancelled or postponed energy projects are likely to drop
to 19 percent of the total foreseen for the region, compared
with 29 percent estimated in last year’s review, it said. Tight
credit remains a problem, and companies are relying now to a
greater degree on equity to finance their energy developments,
said Apicorp, based in Khobar,  Saudi Arabia .  The average  capital structure  for the oil and gas supply
chain is likely to be 57 percent equity and 43 percent debt from
2011 to 2015, the review said. By comparison, Apicorp’s review
for 2009 to 2013 cited an average equity share of 54 percent,
while the review it released a year earlier noted a 50 percent
equity share.  Energy investment in the region will increase because of
global demand and in spite of heightened uncertainty stemming
from turmoil in parts of the Arab world, Apicorp said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
