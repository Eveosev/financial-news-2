  Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, had 4.05 billion reais ($2.4
billion) last year in contracts and services where possible
overpayment was detected by a federal court, newspaper O Globo
reported, citing audit reports.  The Brazilian federal court that oversees government
spending, known as the TCU, found in an audit of Petrobras’s
2010 contracts possible instances of overbilling, overpayment or
payment for work that was not performed, the newspaper said
after reviewing 81 reports from the court.  A Petrobras media official in  Rio de Janeiro , who declined
to be named according to corporate policies, said the TCU
reports are preliminary and that the company is currently
discussing their accuracy with the tribunal, when contacted by
Bloomberg News for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
