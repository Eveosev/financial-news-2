Israeli  government bonds  fell for a
third day, sending yields to the highest level in more than a
week, on investor expectation the central bank will raise
interest rates for a second consecutive month tomorrow.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer , who last month
boosted the interest rate to 2.25 percent, likely will lift the
rate to 2.5 percent at the next policy setting meeting tomorrow,
according to all 19 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Most
revised their forecasts after reports last week showed the
economy grew at the fastest pace in four years and inflation was
higher than economists’ estimates.  “Following last week’s releases the market’s speculation
of a rate increase this week have intensified,” said Ron Eichel, chief economist at Tel Aviv-based Meitav Investment
House Ltd.    Israel ’s economy grew an annualized 7.8 percent in the last
quarter of 2010, the most in four years. The consumer-price
index rose 0.2 percent in January, above the median forecast of
13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg for zero inflation.  The yield on the 10-year benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due
January 2020 rose two basis points to 5.05 percent at 12:17 p.m.
in Tel Aviv. Shorter-term bonds, more sensitive to changes in
interest rates, declined, sending the yield on the Mimshal
Shiklit 4 percent note due March 2012 four basis points higher
to 3.04 percent. The spread between the 2- and 10-year notes
narrowed 2 basis points to 201, the lowest this month.  The shekel was little changed on Feb. 18 at 3.6149 per
dollar, having gained 1.9 percent for the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
