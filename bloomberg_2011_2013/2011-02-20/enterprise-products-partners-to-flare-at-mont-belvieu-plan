  Enterprise Products Partners LP  will
flare some product as it clears pipelines at its Mont Belvieu
natural gas liquids storage site near Houston, according to a
filing with Texas regulators.  The company will use a portable flare at the complex from
noon local time today until Feb. 22, the filing said. The
flaring is related to maintenance at the plant after a fire
Feb. 8.  The complex, 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Houston, is a
storage and trading hub for gas liquids including ethane, butane
and propane. The plant fractionates, or separates, these
components from mixtures of gas liquids gathered at drilling
sites across  North America , according to Enterpriseâ€™s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
