Global sugar production may exceed
demand for the first time in four years if “normal weather
conditions” return to the biggest growing nations, broker and
researcher  Jonathan Kingsman  said.  The market may have surplus of 5.61 million metric tons in
the year from April 1, compared with a deficit of 102,000 tons
this season, as farmers in China,  Brazil ,  Russia  and  Thailand 
boost acreage, Kingsman, managing director of the Switzerland-
based company, told a conference in Dubai today.  Excess production may help cool global food costs which
reached a record in January according to the  United Nations ’
World Food Price Index. Raw sugar soared to 36.08 cents per
pound in  New York  on Feb. 2, the highest level since 1980, on
concern that global supplies will lag demand after a storm in  Australia  and drought in Russia crimped harvests.  “Prices of over 25 cents for more than half of the last 18
months should have given strong signals to producers to expand
production,” Kingsman said. “More normal growing conditions in
2011-2012 should allow for some relief for supplies, but that
may take until late in 2011 before stocks turn the corner.”  A forecast for the sugar market swinging into surplus is in
contrast to deficits in other crops, including wheat, which have
helped push up prices and contributed to political unrest in
nations in North Africa and the Middle East. Wheat has jumped 71
percent in the past year, corn is near the highest since July
2008 and soybeans have jumped 45 percent in the past 12 months.  Sugar for delivery from May 2011 through October 2013 is in
backwardation, reflecting expectations that prices may ease in
the coming months, Kingsman said in an interview Feb. 18.
Backwardation occurs when near-term contracts are more expensive
than those further out.  Weak Demand  “Given that recent sugar prices are at their highest since
1981, we expect there to be some loss of consumption, and at
least some tempering of expected consumption increments in many
countries,” Kingsman said. Demand will expand 1.48 percent in
the 2011-2012 season, compared with the normal annual increase
of 2 percent, he said.  Global production may expand by 8.15 million tons to 173.2
million tons, while consumption may grow by 2.44 million tons to
167.6 million tons, Kingsman said. The biggest gain in output
will come from  China , where production may climb by 1.85 million
tons, followed by Russia and Brazil’s Center South region, which
may boost harvests by 1.52 million tons and 1.19 million tons.  Kingsman in December predicted a deficit of 369,000 tons
for the current year ending March. Estimates for 2011-2012 are
made with “the assumption of normal global weather conditions,
which haven’t tended to be all that common of late,” he said.  Stockpiles will stay low for the next year and the deficit
may last for the first six months of 2011, Kingsman said today.  Cyclone Damage  Tropical Cyclone Yasi hit northern Queensland in Australia,
a region growing a third of the country’s cane, cutting output
potential in the area by about 50 percent, producers’ group
 Canegrowers  said Feb. 4. That may keep exports from the world’s
third-biggest supplier at a two-decade low of 2.2 million tons
in 2011, according to Queensland Sugar Ltd.  “We’re still in the middle of the cyclone season and the
uncertainty on the crop outlook isn’t over yet,” Queensland
Chairman Alan Winney said in an interview at the conference.
Production won’t return to normal levels of 4.2 million to 5
million tons until 2012-2013, he said.  Queensland Sugar accounts for more than 90 percent of
Australia’s overseas sales of the commodity.  Frost damaged about 1.9 million mu (126,667 hectares) of
cane in China’s Guangxi province, the China News Service said on
Jan. 12, citing the local agricultural authority. The nation’s
central bank Feb. 18 raised  reserve requirements  for lenders for
the second time this year to counter inflation.
