Finance Bank of Zambia, the nation’s
biggest locally-owned lender, will be put up for sale next
month, the privately owned Post newspaper reported today in
Lusaka, citing Central Bank governor Caleb Fundanga.  The central bank in December seized the Finance Bank and
tapped FirstRand Ltd. of  South Africa  to manage the organization
after the Zambian institution’s owners were accused of breaching
financial services laws.  “We are just moving to the next stage,” which includes
the sale of the bank with 1,000 employees and 39 branches across
Zambia, said Fundanga.  John Sangwa, the bank’s lawyer, said on Dec. 30 said that
he had obtained an injunction blocking the sale of Finance Bank
until the court had time for a full hearing on the matter.  Sangwa and Kanguya Mayondi, the central bank’s head of
public relations, could not be reached by telephone for comment
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
