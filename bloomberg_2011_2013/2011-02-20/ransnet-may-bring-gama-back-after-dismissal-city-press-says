Transnet Ltd.,  South Africa ’s state-
owned rail and ports company, may reappoint former executive

citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  Gama may return as chief operating officer and met with
Executive Chairman Mafika Mkwanazi, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. Gama was fired from his post of chief executive
officer of Transnet’s freight rail business last June after
being found guilty of misconduct.  To contact the reporter on this story:
