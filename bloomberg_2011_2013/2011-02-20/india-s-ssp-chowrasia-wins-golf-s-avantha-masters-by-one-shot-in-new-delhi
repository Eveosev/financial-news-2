  India ’s SSP Chowrasia secured a one-
shot victory on home soil at the Avantha Masters after a final
round 67 at the DLF Golf and Country Club in  New Delhi .  Chowrasia finished on 15-under-par 273, pushing Robert
Coles into second spot to deny the Englishman a first European
Tour title.  Gregory Havret of France was a further shot back, with
Robert-Jan Derksen of the Netherlands on 12-under.  Chowrasia collects a check for 300,000 euros ($411,000). It
