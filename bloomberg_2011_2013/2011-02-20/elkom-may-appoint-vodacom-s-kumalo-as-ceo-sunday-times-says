Telkom South Africa Ltd. may name
Romeo Kumalo, an executive of Vodacom Group Ltd., as chief
executive officer, the  Sunday Times  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Kumalo, who is head of commercial affairs at mobile-phone
operator Vodacom, has the support of Lazarus Zim, who was
appointed Telkom’s chairman on Feb. 17, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said.  Pynee Chetty, a spokesman for Telkom, said he wasn’t privy
to discussions of the company’s board, declining to comment
further when called on his mobile phone today. Telkom’s acting
Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Hedberg leaves his post at the
end of March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
