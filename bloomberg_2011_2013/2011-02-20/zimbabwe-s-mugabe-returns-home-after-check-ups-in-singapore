Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
returned from  Singapore  today, after medical check-ups following
an earlier eye operation in that country.  Mugabe recently underwent cataract procedures during a
vacation in Singapore, the state-controlled Sunday Mail
newspaper reported last week, citing presidential spokesman
George Charamba.  Mugabe, who turns 87 on Feb. 21, appeared fit as he was met
by senior government officials at Harare International Airport,
and walked with no visible difficulty. He did not speak to
waiting journalists, including a Bloomberg News reporter.  Last month, Mugabe described as “naked lies” a report by
The Telegraph newspaper of Britain that he had traveled to  Malaysia  for treatment on his prostate. He said he had been in
Singapore on vacation.  Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since 1980. Two years ago, his  Zimbabwe  African National Union-Patriotic Front party formed a
power-sharing government with the Movement for Democratic Change
after a disputed presidential vote marred by violence.  The coalition government managed to end Zimbabwe’s decade-
long recession in 2009, though the parties have frequently
wrangled over government posts, the writing of a new
constitution, and the timing of fresh elections.  Last December, Mugabe was nominated by his party to stand
as its presidential candidate in polls he says should be held
this year, with or without a new constitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
