Jordan’s Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said the U.S. veto of a United Nations resolution
condemning Israeli settlements in the  West Bank  as
“regretful,” the state news agency Petra reported.  “This is a regretful position as the  United States  has
constantly declared that Israeli settlements are illegal,” he
said in an interview with  Petra  today.  Judeh urged the U.S. to “correct” its position, which he
said would encourage  Israel  to build more settlements and thus
jeopardize chances of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.  The U.S. position also harms the “credibility” of the
U.S. in its role in the Middle East peace process, he said.  Jordan is an American ally that has signed a peace treaty
with Israel and is one of the biggest Middle Eastern recipients
of U.S. aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
