  New Zealand ’s government said that
107 pilot whales died after becoming stranded on a remote island
beach at the bottom of the country’s  South Island .  Two overseas visitors discovered the whales on Stewart
Island yesterday when about half of the animals were still
alive, according to a statement on the Department of
Conservation’s website. Department workers were forced to kill
48 whales to stop their suffering as dry weather conditions
would have prevented a successful rescue attempt, it said.  “With just five people currently on site and the tide on
its way out, we saw little hope of keeping the animals alive
until enough rescuers could be flown in to assist,” Brent
Beaven, biodiversity program manager said in the statement.  The whales will be left to decompose naturally on the
beach, due to its remoteness, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
