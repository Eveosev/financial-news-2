  Xstrata Plc  still wants to buy
platinum producer  Lonmin Plc , the  Independent on Sunday 
reported.  The newspaper cited remarks made by Xstrata’s Chief
Executive Officer Mick Davis, whose comments to investors at a
private lunch this month have been interpreted as meaning his
preferred option is to buy out Lonmin.  An unnamed Xstrata spokesman said that options may include
a sale of the 25-percent stake in Lonmin already owned by
Xstrata or an offer for the remaining shares it doesn’t hold,
The Independent on Sunday said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
