Electricite de France SA should
charge 39 euros ($53.40) per megawatt hour for wholesale nuclear
power, according to a government-commissioned report to be
published by mid-March,  Le Journal du Dimanche  said, citing an
unidentified person who participated in the report.  The conclusions of the report by Paul Champsaur are ready
and the recommendation is for a wholesale price that is a
compromise between the 35 euros sought by competitors including  GDF Suez  SA and the 42 euros that EDF says is the minimum price
to cover production costs, the weekly newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
