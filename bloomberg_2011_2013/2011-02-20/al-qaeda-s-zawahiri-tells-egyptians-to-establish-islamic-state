Al-Qaeda’s second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahiri urged Egyptians to revive Islamic rule and
criticized  Hosni Mubarak  as a “modern-day pharaoh” in remarks
that came before the former Egyptian president was toppled.  “The Egyptian regime is in fact a repressive regime that
relies on brutality and rigged elections while the Islamic
system is consultative and seeks to achieve justice,” the
Egyptian militant leader said in an audio recording posted on a
website used by Islamist groups including al-Qaeda.  Mubarak was ousted Feb. 11 after 18 days of anti-government
protests that demanded political and economic reforms. Al-
Qaeda’s Saudi-born leader Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri have
often condemned the Mubarak regime for its ties to Israel and
the U.S. and urged Muslims to remove U.S.-backed rulers.    Egypt , under the late president Anwar Sadat, was the first
Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with  Israel  in 1979. Mubarak,
who took over after Islamists killed Sadat, upheld the accord.  “The reality of Egypt is the reality of deviation from
Islam,” Zawahiri, an Egyptian, said in the recording, part of a
documentary by al-Qaeda’s media arm As-Sahab titled: “A message
of Hope and Good Tidings to Our Folk in Egypt.”  “Secularism entered our countries through military
occupation, oppression and massacres,” he said. “Western
secularism is animus to Islam and supportive to Zionism.”  The production, which is 34 minutes and 40 seconds in
length, was made during the Islamic calendar month that ended
Feb. 4. The rebellion started Jan 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
