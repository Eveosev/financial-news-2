  Greencore Group Plc  is talking to
U.S. hedge fund  Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC  about a
possible counter bid for English food maker Northern Foods Plc,
the Sunday Business Post reported.  Och Ziff is considering its options ahead of a March 2
deadline for a new bid by Greencore, the newspaper said, without
saying where it obtained the information. A planned merger of
Northern Foods and Dublin-based Greencore was derailed last
month after Boparan Holdings Ltd. made a higher bid for the
maker of Foxâ€™s biscuits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
