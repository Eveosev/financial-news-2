Huawei Technologies Co.,  China ’s
largest phone networks maker, is offering 50 million pounds ($81
million) of “aid” to install a free mobile telephone network
in the London Underground, the Sunday Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The agreement is likely to be signed by April and would
allow London’s subway passengers to send and receive e-mails in
time for the  London 2012 Olympics , the newspaper said. Huawei,
working with Thales SA on the transmitters, would earn fees for
maintenance, and  Vodafone Group Plc  and Telefonica SA’s O2 would
pay for installation, the paper said.  Patrick Mercer, a Conservative member of Parliament and
former member of the counter-terrorism subcommittee, said
China’s involvement in U.K. mobile phone networks should raise
concerns about cyberattacks and the ability of people to
detonate bombs on Underground trains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
