The Crown Prince of Bahrain will
decide whether the season-opening Grand Prix goes ahead there on
March 13, Formula One chief  Bernie Ecclestone  said.  Doubt surrounds the event because of civil strife that has
broken out in Bahrain as protesters call for more democracy.  “If anybody’s going to sort it out he’s the guy to do
it,” Ecclestone told the British Broadcasting Corp’s Sportsweek
radio program, referring to Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al
Khalifa. “He would decide whether or not it’s safe for us to be
there.”  Arab governments are cracking down on pro-democracy
activists as uprisings that toppled leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt 
spread to Bahrain, Libya,  Algeria  and elsewhere.  At least five people have been killed in Bahrain and more
than 100 people were being treated at the Salmaniya Hospital
after violent clashes two days ago, said Ahmed Jamal, president
of the Bahrain medical society.  “Let’s wait until Tuesday and see if this one’s going to
take place before we decide what to do,” Ecclestone said.
“Maybe we could postpone Bahrain or run it later in the year.”  Three days ago, motor racing series GP2  Asia , a junior
series with ties to Formula One, canceled a race in Bahrain this
weekend at the circuit in the desert south of capital Manama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
