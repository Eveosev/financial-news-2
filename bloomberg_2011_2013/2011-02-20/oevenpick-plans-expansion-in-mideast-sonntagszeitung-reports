Moevenpick Hotels & Resorts
Management AG plans to oversee up to 27 new hotels in North and
Sub-Saharan Africa, SonntagsZeitung reported, citing an
interview with the company’s Chief Executive Jean Gabriel Peres.  Peres said Moevenpick’s medium-term aim was to run another
12 to 15 hotels in North Africa, including  Egypt , and 12 south
of the  Sahara Desert , the paper said.  Because Moevenpick manages hotels and does not own them,
unrest in Egypt had affected returns only slightly, and any
losses would be balanced by operations in other regions, Peres
said. The company currently manages 16 hotels on the continent,
the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
