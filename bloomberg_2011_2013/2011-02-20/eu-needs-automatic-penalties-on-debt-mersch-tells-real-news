The European Union should impose
automatic penalties on countries breaking the euro-region’s debt
limits, European Central Bank council memberYves Mersch said in
an interview with newspaper  Real News of Greece .  “It would be preferable to put more emphasis on automatic
sanctions to achieve the Maastricht criteria instead of being
led to an intergovernmental accord to change the constitution of
every country, which could prove even more cumbersome than a
treaty,” Mersch told the newspaper in an interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
