  Derek Jeter  said he won’t fret about
reaching 3,000 career hits in  Major League Baseball .  The shortstop is the  New York Yankees ’ all-time hits leader
and needs another 74 to reach a mark that 27 batters have
achieved in the major leagues before him.  “It’s going to be a party the whole year,” Jeter told
reporters jokingly today in Tampa,  Florida , ahead of spring
training. “It’s something that’s very hard to do.”  The Yankees captain is the leader among active players in
career hits, with 2,926. Jeter said he’s just as motivated going
into his 17th season at New York as he was when he signed for
the most successful baseball team in 1992, three years before he
made his debut.  “My job is to come and play shortstop and try to help this
team win,” Jeter said. “That’s never changed.”  Something that does change each year is getting physically
prepared for another season, the 36-year-old said.  “When you’re younger, I don’t think you have to do as
much,” Jeter said. “You get older, you need to take less time
off. It’s easier to stay in shape than get back into shape.”  Jeter batted .270 in 2010, his worst performance on that
measure since his first season and below his career average of
.314. In 16 seasons, he’s hit 234 home runs and has 1,135 runs
batted in.  Jeter signed a three-year contract extension in December
that the  New York  Times said is valued at between $15 million
and $17 million annually. It also carries an option for a fourth
year. The player said the anger that he felt about the way
details about the talks were made public has subsided.  “From day one, the ultimate goal was to be here,” Jeter
said. “I’m here and I’m happy about it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
