David and Frederick Barclay, owners
of the Telegraph Media Group, are close to an agreement to gain
full control of the Maybourne Hotels Ltd., the Sunday Times
said, without saying where it obtained the information.  The brothers last month bought a 24.8 percent stake in
Coroin Ltd., the parent company of Maybourne, owner of  London ’s
Claridge’s, Berkeley and Connaught hotels. The Barclays are in
discussions to buy out the interests of other shareholders Paddy
McKillen, Derek Quinlan, and Kyran McLaughlin, the newspaper
said.  An agreement may be reached in the next few weeks, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
