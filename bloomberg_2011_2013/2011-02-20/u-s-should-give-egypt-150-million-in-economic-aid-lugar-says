The U.S. should direct $150 million
in economic aid to  Egypt  because the U.S. ally’s economy “is in
the tank,” Senator  Richard Lugar  said today on CNN’s “State of
the Union” program.  The Indiana Senator, top Republican on the  Foreign
Relations Committee , said the U.S. should concentrate on
providing financial help to Egypt instead of providing advice on
how to best build a democratic system.  “Our assistance here may be the most influential thing we
can do,” he said. The “Egyptian economy is in the tank,” with
the tourism industry “demolished” and wheat and corn prices
affecting whether the country can feed its people, he said.  Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  on Feb. 17 said the
Democratic Obama Administration is preparing a $150 million aid
package to help Egypt recover after the revolt that ousted
President  Hosni Mubarak .  Unrest in Egypt has cost the nation about $1.5 billion in
tourism revenue, according to Central Bank Governor Farouk El- Okdah. It has forced companies to close and sent the currency to
a six-year low. Before Mubarak’s resignation, the benchmark
EGX30 Index tumbled 16 percent in one week.  Egypt, which has a peace treaty with  Israel , is the one of
the closest U.S. allies in the Mideast and the fourth largest
recipient of U.S. aid for the fiscal year 2011, according to
State Department figures.  The State Department’s 2012 budget proposal, released Feb.
14, preserves $1.5 billion in assistance to Egypt, with nearly
87 percent directed to the military. Representative Ileana Ros- Lehtinen, the Florida Republican who heads the  House Committee
on Foreign Affairs  and who is backing cuts to the State
Department budget request, has said the agency mishandled prior
aid funding to Egypt.  To contact the reporter on this story: Danielle Ivory at +1-202-
