Authorities in the U.S. arrested a
Credit Suisse employee as a “material witness” in an
investigation into several banks suspected of helping tax
evaders,  SonntagsZeitung  reported.  The Swiss newspaper cited an unidentified Credit Suisse
manager as saying the suspected offenses related to the time
before the employee worked at the bank.  The banker, named only as C.B., was arrested two weeks ago
on entering the U.S. and barred from leaving the country, the
paper said. He is a Greek national based in Zurich, according to
the report.  A Credit Suisse spokesman told Bloomberg News by telephone
that he could not comment “on legal issues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
