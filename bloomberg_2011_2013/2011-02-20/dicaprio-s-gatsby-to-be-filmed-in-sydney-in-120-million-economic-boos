  Leonardo DiCaprio , the  Oscar-
nominated  U.S. actor, will assume the title role in a remake in
Australia of ‘The Great Gatsby’ after Sydney beat  New York  to
produce the movie.  Baz Luhrmann will direct the Warner Bros.-backed film,
based on the 1920s novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and production
will inject more than A$120 million ($120 million) into the
state’s economy, the New South Wales government said in a
statement today.  DiCaprio, who worked with Luhrmann 15 years ago in ‘Romeo +
Juliet,’ reprises a role made famous in 1974 by Robert Redford.
The agreement to make the movie in Australia comes even after
its currency gained 13 percent against the  U.S. dollar  in the
past year.  “Australia was thought to be losing international
filmmaking due to the strong Aussie dollar,” Premier Kristina Keneally said in the statement. “This is a big win.”  Luhrmann was born in New South Wales and directed the 2008
movie ‘Australia,’ according to the Internet Movie Database.  To contact the reporter on this story:
