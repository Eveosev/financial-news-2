Blake Griffin’s victory in the  National Basketball Association ’s All-Star slam dunk contest was
watched by a record television audience, TNT said, citing
Nielsen Co. data.  The Saturday night broadcast delivered 8.1 million total
viewers, 5.1 million households and a 4.4 rating, Time Warner
Inc.’s TNT said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s 49
percent more than last year and 23 percent more than 2009, which
set the old record for the 26-year-old event.  Viewership peaked at 10.4 million for Griffin’s winning
shot. The rookie took a pass through the sunroof of a Kia Optima
from Los Angeles Clippers teammate Baron Davis as he leaped over
the hood of the car to deliver a two-handed dunk.   The All-Star Game is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. eastern
time at the Staples Center in  Los Angeles .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
