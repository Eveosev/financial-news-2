The Sharks beat the defending
champion Reds 30-17 and the Crusaders defeated the Bulls 28-13
to advance to next week’s Super Rugby semifinals.  JP Pietersen, Paul Jordaan and Charl McLeod scored tries in
the sixth-seeded Sharks’ qualifying playoff win in Brisbane.
Frederic Michalak kicked 15 points for the visiting Sharks, who
face the top-seeded Stormers in an all-South African semifinal
in Cape Town on July 28.  Dan Carter  kicked 23 points and Zac Guilford scored a try
to lead the Crusaders to the home win in Christchurch,  New
Zealand . The fourth-seeded Crusaders, who are seeking a record-
extending eighth title in rugby union’s southern hemisphere
provincial championship, will visit the Chiefs, the No. 2 seed,
July 27 in Hamilton.  The Stormers earned the top seeding for the six-team
playoffs by finishing first in the regular-season standings
ahead of New Zealand’s Chiefs. The top two, who are both seeking
their first southern hemisphere provincial championship, had a
bye this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
