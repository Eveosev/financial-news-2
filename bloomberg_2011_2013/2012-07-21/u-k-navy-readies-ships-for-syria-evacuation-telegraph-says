The U.K. navy is drawing up a plan
for an eventual mass evacuation of Britons from  Syria  and
neighboring countries as violence in the Middle Eastern nation
escalates, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  The flotilla, which will include the helicopter carrier HMS
Illustrious and the amphibious ship HMS Bulwark, will probably
be stationed off the coast of Cyprus and is not currently being
considered for “a combat role,” the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified navy commander.  To contact the reporter on this story:
