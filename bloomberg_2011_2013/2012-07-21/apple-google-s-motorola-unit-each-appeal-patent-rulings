Apple Inc. and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Motorola Mobility unit filed separate appeals of a federal
judge’s June 22 order dismissing their mutual patent-
infringement claims.  U.S. Circuit Judge Richard A. Posner threw out the
companies’ claims about two weeks after he rejected each mobile-
phone maker’s damages theories and canceled a  jury trial  that
had been set for June 11 in federal court in Chicago. The appeal
notices, which also involved earlier rulings, were filed there
today.  That trial would have been the first between Apple, the
maker of the iPhone, and Google, creator of the Android smart
phone operating system, since the  Mountain View , California-
based company completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of
Motorola Mobility in May.  Motorola was pressing a claim that Cupertino, California-
based Apple infringed a cellular technology patent, while Apple
accused Motorola of violating four patents.  After rejecting each companies’ theories on damages, Posner
agreed to hear arguments on whether either company was entitled
to injunctive relief.  “Neither party is entitled to an injunction,” Posner said
in a 38-page ruling on June 22. “Neither has shown that damages
would not be an adequate remedy.”  Because he had determined their damages theories were
unsound, the case was over, he said.  The case is  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  v. Motorola Mobility Inc., 11-
cv-08540, U.S. District Court, Northern District of  Illinois 
(Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
