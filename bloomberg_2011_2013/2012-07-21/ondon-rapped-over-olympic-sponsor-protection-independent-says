Michael Payne, the man responsible
for creating Olympic sponsorship programs, criticized organizers
of London 2012 for “going too far” in protecting their
 sponsors , the Independent reported.  The enforcement of exclusivity rights risks damaging the
games, Payne, a former marketing director for the  International
Olympic Committee , said in an interview with the U.K. newspaper.  “There is no question in my view that the controls and the
protections have gone too far when it is starting to suffocate
local street traders and I don’t think it’s necessarily what the
Olympic sponsors are looking for,” Payne was quoted as saying.  Companies sponsor the games in return for exclusive rights
to Olympic trademarks and guarantees that only their products
are sold at Olympic venues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
