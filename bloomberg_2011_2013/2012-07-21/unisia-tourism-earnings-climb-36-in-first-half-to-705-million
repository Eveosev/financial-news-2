Tunisian tourism earnings jumped 36%
in the first half as visitors from countries including  Russia ,
the U.K., Libya and  Belgium  traveled to the North African nation
after last year’s revolution.  Tourism revenue increased to 1.15 billion dinars ($705
million) as 2.5 million people visited, the industry’s minister,
Elyes FakhFekh, said at a press conference yesterday. Tourism,
which accounts for 6.5 percent of gross domestic product, is the
largest source of foreign currency and the second-largest
employing industry after agriculture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
