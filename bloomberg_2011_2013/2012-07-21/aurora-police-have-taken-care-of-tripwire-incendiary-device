The Aurora, Colorado, police
department and other agencies have safely taken care of a
tripwire at the entrance of suspect James Holmes’ apartment,
Sergeant Cassidee Carlson said.  “This is serious stuff,” Carlson said in a televised
briefing. The tripwire was rigged to an incendiary device
intended to kill whomever came in, she said. Carlson said
authorities are working to remove other booby traps in the
apartment, and the second  phase may include a “controlled
detonation.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
