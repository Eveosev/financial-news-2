The Atlanta Braves rallied from a
nine-run deficit to defeat the Nationals 11-10 in 11 innings
last night and move within 2 1/2 games of first-place Washington
in the National League East division.  Host Washington built a 9-0 lead after five innings, thanks
in large part to three-run homers by Michael Morse and  Ryan Zimmerman . Atlanta scored four runs in the sixth inning and four
more in the eighth to pull within a run.  Michael Bourn  hit a two-run triple in the top of the ninth
to give the Braves their first lead at 10-9, only to have Danny
Espinosa hit a solo homer in the bottom of the inning to send
the game into extra innings.  Paul Janish had a run-scoring single in the 11th for
Atlantaâ€™s decisive run.  The  New York Mets , who lost 7-6 at home to the Los Angeles
Dodgers, are in third place in the NL East, seven games behind
Washington. Johan Santana (6-7) took the loss for the Mets,
allowing six runs on seven hits in three innings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
