Centuries from Hashim Amla and
captain  Graeme Smith  helped  South Africa  take control of the
opening cricket Test against England.  Amla is 183 not out and Smith scored 131 in his 100th
career Test as South Africa reached 403-2 in response to
England’s first-innings total of 385. Jacque Kallis was 83 not
out as the Proteas took an 18-run lead at stumps on day three at
the Oval in London.  South Africa, the No. 3 Test team in International Cricket
Council rankings, could overtake  No. 1 England by winning the
three-match series, which continues with games at Leeds and at
Lord’s in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
