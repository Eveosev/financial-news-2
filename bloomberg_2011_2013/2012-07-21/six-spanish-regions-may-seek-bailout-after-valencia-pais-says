The Balearic Islands and Catalonia
are among six Spanish regions that may ask for aid from the
central government after Valencia sought a bailout,  El Pais 
reported.  Castilla-La-Mancha, Murcia, the  Canary Islands  and possibly
Andalusia are also having difficulty funding themselves and some
of these regions are studying plans to tap the recently created
emergency-loan fund that Valencia said it would use yesterday,
the newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Spain  created the 18 billion-euro ($23 billion) bailout
mechanism last week to help cash-strapped regions even as its
own access to financial markets narrows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
