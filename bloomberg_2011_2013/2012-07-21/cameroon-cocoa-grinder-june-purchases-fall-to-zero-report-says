Cocoa purchases by Cameroon’s major
grinder of the chocolate ingredient fell to zero in June, the
Cocoa and Coffee Board and the Cocoa and Coffee
Interprofessional Board said in a joint report.  Sic-Cacao and Chococam bought no beans compared with the
1,292 metric tons a year earlier, the institutions said in an e-
mail from the port city of Douala today without further details.
The two grinders have so far bought 28,466 metric tons since the
season started on Aug. 1.  Cameroon is  Africa ’s fourth-largest producer of the crop,
after  Ivory Coast , Ghana and Nigeria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
