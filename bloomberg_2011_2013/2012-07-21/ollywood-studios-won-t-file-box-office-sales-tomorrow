Major Hollywood studios said they
won’t release their box-office results for the weekend tomorrow,
following the lead of  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s  Warner Bros ., which
postponed them until July 23.  Box-office figures will be released Monday, Hollywood.com
said in an e-mailed statement. Warner Bros. postponed the
release after yesterday’s fatal shooting during “The Dark
Knight Rises” premiere in Aurora,  Colorado .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
