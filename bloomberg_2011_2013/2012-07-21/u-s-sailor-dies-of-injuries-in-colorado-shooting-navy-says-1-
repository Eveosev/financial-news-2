Two U.S. military service members
died from injuries in the Colorado theater shooting rampage that
killed at least 12 moviegoers, the Defense Department said
today.  Air Force Staff Sergeant Jesse Childress, who was assigned
to Buckley Air Force Base, died after the shooting in the Denver
suburb of Aurora, said Captain Shannon Stoneking, an Air Force
spokeswoman.  Childress, 29, was a reservist who worked as a cyber
systems operator, Stoneking said.  Navy Petty Officer Third Class John Larimer, 27, also died
in the shooting, the Navy said. Larimer, who was from Crystal
Lake,  Illinois , was a cryptologic technician who joined the Navy
on June 16, 2011, the Navy said.  “I am incredibly saddened by the loss of Petty Officer
John Larimer,” said Commander Jeffrey Jakuboski, Larimer’s
commanding officer, in a written statement. “He was an
outstanding shipmate. A valued member of our Navy team, he will
be missed by all who knew him. My heart goes out to John’s
family, friends and loved ones, as well as to all victims of
this horrible tragedy.”  Larimer had been stationed at Buckley Air Force Base since
October, the Navy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
