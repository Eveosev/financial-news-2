An explosion and fire shut two
pipelines that transport oil from Kirkuk in northern  Iraq  to the
Turkish port of Ceyhan, the  Associated Press  reported, citing an
unnamed official from the Turkish energy ministry.  The blast, which happened late yesterday, damaged a section
of one of the pipelines, AP cited the official as saying. The
second pipeline runs parallel and was shut down as a
precautionary measure, according to the report. Firefighters
were still trying to extinguish the blaze, the official said.  The cause of the explosion is still being investigated and
may have been due to sabotage, AP cited the official as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
