Two U.S. military service members
have died from injuries in the Colorado shooting rampage that
killed at least 12 moviegoers, the Pentagon confirmed today.  Air Force Staff Sergeant Jesse Childress, who was assigned
to Buckley Air Force Base, died in the Denver suburb of Aurora,
said Lieutenant Colonel Jack Miller, a Pentagon spokesman.  Navy Petty Officer Third Class John Larimer, 27, also died
from injuries in the shooting, the Navy said. Larimer, who was
from Crystal Lake,  Illinois , was a cryptologic technician who
joined the Navy on June 16, 2011, the Navy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
