Colombia ’s state-controlled oil
company Ecopetrol SA halted pumping at three wells in Putumayo
province in the south of the country after what it described as
“terrorist action” yesterday.  The attack caused oil to spill into a nearby creek, the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  Colombian armed forces are securing the area so that
Ecopetrol staff can assess the damage and start to clean up the
spill, the statement said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
