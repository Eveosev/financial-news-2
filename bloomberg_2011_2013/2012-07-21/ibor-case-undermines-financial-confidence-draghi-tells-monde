European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said that revelations about the setting of the
Libor, or London offered interbank rate, undermine confidence in
the the world’s financial system, according to an interview with
French newspaper Le Monde.  Rebuilding the financial-services industry after the crisis
requires “lots to be done,” Draghi also told Le Monde.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
