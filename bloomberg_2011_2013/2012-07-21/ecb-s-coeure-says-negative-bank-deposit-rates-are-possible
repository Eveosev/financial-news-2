The  European Central Bank ’s decision
to cut deposit rates to zero had a “substantial” impact, while
the bank needs to “reflect a lot” before deciding to reduce
the rate further, ECB executive board member Benoit Coeure said.  Speaking today in Mexico City, Coeure said he sees the
global economy moving toward very low or zero growth, stopping
short of recession.  Coeure said the ECB needs to find ways to reduce reliance
on ratings companies and can build credit rating capacities
within its own institutions for some sovereigns. The central
bank decided July 5 to cut its  benchmark rate  to a record low of
0.75 percent as well as cutting the rate it pays on overnight
deposits to zero.  “The impact has been quite substantial on the whole yield
curve,” Coeure said. “Now we see negative yields for all kinds
of  government securities .”  Before deciding whether to move the deposit facility to a
negative yield “we’ll reflect a  lot,” he said. “It’s
possible.”  The ECB will need to consider whether markets can function
at negative  interest rates , he said. “Some of them can,” he
said. “Some of them currently don’t. There are technical
issues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
