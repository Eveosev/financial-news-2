Syrian President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s
troops are moving chemical weapons across the country in
preparation for their use, Reuters reported, citing General
Mustafa Sheikh, who defected to Turkey.  The weapons are being moved from storage, possibly in
retaliation for a July 18 bomb attack which claimed several top
regime officials, the general told Reuters in an interview,
citing rebel intelligence obtained in recent days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
