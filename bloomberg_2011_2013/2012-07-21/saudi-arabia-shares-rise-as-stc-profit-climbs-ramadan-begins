Saudi Arabian shares climbed to the
highest in a week after  Saudi Telecom Co. (STC)  and food producer
 Savola Group (SAVOLA)  reported an increase in profit and as Ramadan, the
month when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset, began.  Saudi Telecom Co., the kingdom’s largest phone company,
advanced 5.8 percent after profit beat analysts’ estimates.
Savola jump the most in 11 months after profit surged 48
percent.  Saudi Basic (SABIC)  Industries Corp., the world’s biggest
petrochemical maker, advanced to the highest since July 10. The
 Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.6 percent to 6,665.65, the
highest since July 14, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The
measure has risen 3.9 percent this year.  “Volumes are expected to be light as Ramadan gets under
way,” Asim Bukhtiar, head of research at Riyad Capital, said in
response to e-mailed questions. “With the earnings season
winding up, investors will take time to absorb the results and
take positions accordingly. Saturday trading does tend to
respond to Friday closing on the international markets.”  U.S. stocks rose for the week, giving the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index its first back-to-back gain since June, as results
from International Business Machines Corp. to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) 
beat estimates and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
he’s prepared to add stimulus.  About 185  million shares  traded on the Tadawul today,
compared with a 12-month daily average of 335 million.  Saudi Telecom advanced to 38.2 riyals after net income rose
7 percent to 2.4 billion riyals ($640 million). The mean
estimate of eight analysts was for a profit of 2.24 billion
riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Savola gained  4.8 percent to 35.10 riyals after the company
reported second-quarter profit of 341.3 million riyals as sales
increased and it added market share in the retail industry.
