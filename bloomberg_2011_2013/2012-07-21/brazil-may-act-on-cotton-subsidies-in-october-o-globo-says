Brazil  may retaliate against the
U.S. in October if it determines that the U.S. isn’t honoring an
agreement over cotton subsidies to American farmers,  O Globo 
reported, citing Brazil’s ambassador at the  World Trade
Organization , Roberto Azevedo.  Brazil will wait until the approval of U.S. farm bill, set
for Sept. 30, to see if it will take any action, O Globo said.  Retaliation could take the form of sanctions on U.S.
imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
