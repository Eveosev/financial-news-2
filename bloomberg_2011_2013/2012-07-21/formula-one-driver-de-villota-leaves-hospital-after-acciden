Formula One test driver Maria de
Villota left the hospital in Cambridge,  England  and returned
home to Spain yesterday, 17 days after losing an eye in an
accident, her Marussia team said.  De Villota was driving Marussia’s MR-01 car for the first
time when it ploughed into a team truck at Duxford Airfield on
July 3. She has made “significant progress’ in her recovery,
Marussia said in an emailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
