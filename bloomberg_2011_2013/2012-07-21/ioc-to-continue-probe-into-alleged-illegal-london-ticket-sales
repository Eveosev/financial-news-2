The  International Olympic Committee 
will continue its investigation into alleged illegal sale of
tickets for the London games published by the Sunday Times last
month.   “The Ethics Commission has received evidence from the
newspaper and noted that each individual case merits a detailed
analysis involving the hearing of all parties, particularly with
regard to the existence of deliberate intent to breach the
various rules that govern the sale of tickets for the  Olympic
Games ,” the IOC said in a statement today.  Separately, U.S. runner Crystal Cox has had the gold medal
she won in the 4x400-meter relay at the 2004 Athens Olympics
removed after being disqualified, the IOC has ruled.  “It is now within the remit of the International
Association of Athletics Federations to interpret its rules as
to whether the disqualification of the athlete would have any
effect on the results of the U.S. relay team,” the statement,
published today following a meeting of the IOC’s executive board
in London, said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
