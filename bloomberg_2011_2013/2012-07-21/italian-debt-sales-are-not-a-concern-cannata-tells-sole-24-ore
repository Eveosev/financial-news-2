Italy’s future debt sales don’t
represent a concern, Maria Cannata, the head of the country’s
debt agency, said in an interview with daily Il Sole 24 Ore
today.   Italy “can make it on its own, the access to markets has
always been open, even in more difficult times,” Cannata said,
according to the newspaper.  Foreign investors, including Japanese, “are returning
because, compared to the negative yields of ‘core’ countries,
investing in BTPs is convenient,” the head of the debt agency
told the newspaper. Fitch Ratings’ decision to confirm the
country’s rating is positive, Cannata said, adding that Italy
doesn’t need to sell three-month Treasury bills this summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
