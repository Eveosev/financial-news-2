U.K. government bonds rose, with
two- and five-year yields falling to records, after policy
makers said they may consider the case for cutting  interest
rates  again as  Europe ’s debt crisis worsens.  Ten-year gilts advanced for a third week as the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its growth forecast for
Britain’s economy, boosting demand for the safety of government
debt. Sterling climbed to the strongest since 2008 versus the
euro as a slide in Spanish and Italian bonds added to concern
European leaders are failing to contain the region’s financial
turmoil. German  two-year yields  were negative for a third week.  “There’s a lot of hunt for yield activity going on with
investors seeking to gain the remaining bits of positive
yield,” said  Sam Hill , a gilt strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in  London . “On that basis, the U.K. still stands out as
looking relatively attractive.”  The  10-year gilts yield  fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, this week to 1.49 percent at 5 p.m. in London
yesterday, approaching the record 1.439 percent set on June 1.
The 4 percent bond due in March 2022 gained 0.605, or 6.05
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,562) face amount, to 122.48.  Two-year yields dropped to 0.103 percent yesterday, and
 five-year  rates declined to 0.472 percent on July 18, both all-
time lows.  The Monetary Policy Committee said while the arguments for
and against cutting the benchmark rate from the current record
low of 0.5 percent hadn’t changed since June, they may be
reviewed in the coming months, according to the minutes of the
July 4-5 meeting released July 18. The MPC voted 7-2 to increase
quantitative easing by 50 billion pounds at the meeting.  IMF Forecast  The IMF cut its forecast for Britain’s gross domestic
product to 0.2 percent for this year, from a previous prediction
of 0.8 percent, and lowered its estimate for 2013 to 1.4 percent
from 2 percent in April.  Economists say a report on July 25 will show the U.K.
economy contracted by 0.3 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “If it were to be a weaker number the market could make
further progress,” RBC’s Hill said. “Any further evidence of
even weaker growth will fuel expectations of even more QE.”  Gilts have returned 1.6 percent this month, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. They gained 16 percent over the
past year as investors sought alternatives to euro-area assets.  The pound rose 1 percent this week to 77.84 pence per euro
after climbing to 77.71 pence yesterday, the strongest since
October 2008. Sterling gained 0.4 percent to $1.5629.  The pound has strengthened 2 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The euro fell 5.5 percent, and the
dollar gained 1.4 percent.  The Debt Management Office plans to sell index-linked gilts
maturing in 2044 through banks next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
