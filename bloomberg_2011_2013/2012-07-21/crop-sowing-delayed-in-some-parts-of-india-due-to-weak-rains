The weakest monsoon rainfall in
three years is delaying sowing of rice, oilseeds and lentils in
several parts of  India , Agriculture Secretary Ashish Bahuguna
told reporters in  New Delhi  today.  The deficient rains may prompt growers to shift to corn
from peanuts in some parts, he said. The worst affected by the
below-average rainfall are Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra and
Rajasthan states, he said.  The area under all the monsoon-sown crops fell 14 percent
to 53.4 million hectares from a year earlier, the agriculture
ministry said yesterday. Monsoon, which accounts for more than
70 percent of Indiaâ€™s annual rainfall, is the worst since 2009
when showers were 22 percent less than a 50-year average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
