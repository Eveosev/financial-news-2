U.K. ministers agreed to meet with
 dairy farmers  that have staged protests in recent days over
prices some food retailers pay them, the  BBC  said on its
website.  Jim Paice, U.K. agriculture minister, and Environment
Secretary Caroline Spelman will hold talks with farmers on July
23 addressing the future of the dairy industry throughout the
supply chain at an agricultural fair in Llanelwedd, Wales, Paice
told the BBC.  The government is also planning to meet representatives of
major supermarket chains in the next few days, the BBC reported,
without saying how it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
