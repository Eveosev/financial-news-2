French Foreign Minister Laurent
Fabius said that the government of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad
is “condemned by his own people” and that the opposition
should take over the running of the country.  “We desire the rapid formation of an interim government
that will have to represent the Syrian society’s diversity,”
Fabius said in an e-mailed declaration today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
