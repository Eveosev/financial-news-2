Jim Thome  of the Orioles hit his
610th home run, moving past  Sammy Sosa  and into sole possession
of seventh place on the Major League Baseball career list.  Thome homered leading off the fourth inning of Baltimore’s
10-2 win last night at the Cleveland Indians.  Thome, 41, who also has played for Cleveland, Philadelphia,
Minnesota, the Chicago White Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers in
a 22-season major league career, is second on the list among
active players -- trailing only Alex Rodriguez of the New York
Yankees, who has 643 career home runs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
