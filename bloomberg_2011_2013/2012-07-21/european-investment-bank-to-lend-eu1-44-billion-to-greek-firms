Greece  and the  European Investment
Bank  reached an agreement today for the lender to resume lending
to Greek firms and for infrastructure projects, the Athens-based
 Finance Ministry  said.  The EIB will disburse a total of 1.44 billion euros ($1.75
billion) in loans to small and medium-sized businesses by the
end of 2015 via Greek banks, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement.  “We look forward to the re-engagement of the EIB in the
 Greek economy  as soon as possible,” especially as the bank’s
lending in Greece “fell to a very low level this year of around
10 million euros,” Finance Minister Yiannis Stounaris said
following a meeting with EIB chief Werner Hoyer, according to
the statement.  The EIB also agreed to support privatizations in Greece,
energy and waste management projects as well as foreign
investment, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
