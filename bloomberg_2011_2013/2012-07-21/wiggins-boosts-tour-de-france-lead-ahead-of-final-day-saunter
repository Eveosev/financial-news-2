Tour de France leader Bradley Wiggins won the final time trial to extend his advantage ahead
of tomorrow’s ceremonial last-day ride to Paris.  The British cyclist won the 33-mile time trial between
Bonneval and Chartres by 1 minute, 16 seconds from Team Sky
teammate Chris Froome. Luis Leon Sanchez of the Rabobank team
was 34 seconds further back in third place.  Wiggins, the last rider to start the time trial in sunny
weather, pumped his fist to celebrate as he crossed the
finishing line in first place. He covered the flat course at an
average speed of 31 miles-per-hour.  The 32-year-old Londoner will become the first British
winner, barring an accident, after the final 74.6-mile ride
between  Rambouillet and Paris .  Traditionally, riders don’t compete for places in the
overall classification on the last stage.  Wiggins extended his overall lead over Froome, a Kenyan-
born Briton, to 3:21 minutes after 19 of the 20 stages. Italy’s
Vincenzo Nibali of the Liquigas team is 6:19 minutes behind in
third place after finishing 16th today.  A Briton has never previously finished in the top three
places in the 109-year-old race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
