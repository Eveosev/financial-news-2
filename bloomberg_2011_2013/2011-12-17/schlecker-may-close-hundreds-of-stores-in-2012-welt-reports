Schlecker may close hundreds of
stores in 2012 in a bid to cut costs,  Welt am Sonntag  reported,
citing an interview with Achim Neumann, the Ver.di trade union
official responsible for the drugstore chain.  “We expect the closing of several hundred branches,” the
newspaper quoted Neumann as saying in an e-mailed preview of an
article to be published tomorrow.  Welt cited Lars Schlecker, a member of the company’s
management board, as saying the “first quarter will be affected
by closures.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
