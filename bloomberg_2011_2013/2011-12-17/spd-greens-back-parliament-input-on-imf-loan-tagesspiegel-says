Germany’s Social Democrat and Green
opposition parties said they support Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann’s request for parliament to have a say on a Bundesbank
loan to the  International Monetary Fund ,  Tagesspiegel  reported,
citing a letter from party leaders to Weidmann.  It’s “exceedingly” distressing that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition didn’t support Weidmann’s suggestion,
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, parliamentary leader of the SPD, and
Green leaders Renate Kuenast and  Juergen Trittin  wrote in the
Dec. 16 letter, the newspaper said, without saying where it got
a copy of the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
