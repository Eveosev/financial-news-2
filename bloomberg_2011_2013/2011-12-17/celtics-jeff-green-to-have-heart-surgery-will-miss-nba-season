Boston Celtics forward  Jeff Green 
will undergo heart surgery Jan. 9 and miss the National
Basketball Association season.  The operation at the Cleveland Clinic “should completely
repair” an aortic aneurysm that was discovered during Green’s
team physical, the Celtics said in a statment on their website.
Green, 25, is expected to resume his career next season, the
team said.  The 6-foot-9 Green averaged 9.8 points and 3.3 rebounds in
26 games for Boston last season after being acquired in a
February trade with Oklahoma City. He’s averaged 13.9 points and
5.5 rebounds over his four-year career.  Boston opens its season Dec. 25 against the  New York Knicks 
at Madison Square Garden.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
