HMV Group Plc (HMV)  is expected to report
a first-half loss on Dec. 19 of 40 million pounds ($62.2
million) and call its suppliers to an “urgent” meeting, the
Guardian reported.  HMV is also expected to tell investors that the Christmas
shopping period isn’t producing the desired increase in sales,
the newspaper reported today.  Some analysts have said HMV cannot survive without a rights
issue in 2012, while other sources speculate  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s
Universal Music Group will come up with a rescue offer for the
business, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
