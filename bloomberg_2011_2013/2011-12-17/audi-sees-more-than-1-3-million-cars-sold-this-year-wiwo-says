Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s luxury unit Audi AG
expects to reach a target of more than 1.3 million car sales
this year,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing an interview with
Audi Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler.  The euro-region debt crisis isn’t having a significant
impact on sales even as it leaves “traces” in some markets,
the magazine cited Stadler as saying in an article on its
website. Audi sees a good chance for further growth next year
and may sell 1.5 million cars earlier than the previously set
target year of 2015, WiWo cited Stadler as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
