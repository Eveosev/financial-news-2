Brazil ’s federal court revoked a
preliminary verdict that blocked the construction of the Belo
Monte dam in the northern state of Para, Folha de S. Paulo
 reported .  Federal judge Carlos Eduardo Castro Martins said in his
decision that the current of the Xingu River won’t be altered
and construction company Norte Energia proved that the
development will maintain natural wildlife, Folha reported.  In September, the same court said the dam project needed to
be suspended because the construction may interfere with the
natural course of the river, the newspaper said.  Norte Energia, the group that is building the hydroelectric
dam, said the suspension didn’t slow down the construction
project, Folha said, without saying who told them the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
