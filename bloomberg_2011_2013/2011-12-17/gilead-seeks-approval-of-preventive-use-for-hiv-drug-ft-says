Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) , the
California-based maker of the HIV treatment Truvada, asked the
U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  to approve the medicine for
use in preventing the disease, the Financial Times reported.  If the request is approved, Truvada could significantly
boost Gilead’s sales and help prevent the spread of a disease
that infects nearly 2.7 million people a year and kills 1.8
million, the newspaper reported today. The drug is currently the
“backbone” of HIV treatment worldwide, the FT said.  The preventative use of Truvada could also cause problems
for Gilead, such as undermining the effectiveness of the drug
for current patients and triggering lawsuits by uninfected
people who experience side effects or become infected, according
to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
