Sports Direct International Plc (SPD) , the
U.K’s biggest sporting-goods retailer, may seek to acquire
Blacks Leisure Group Plc by buying some of its debt,  The Times 
reported, citing a source close to the process.  Sports Direct shares surged 10.5 percent yesterday to 210
pence after the retailer said it dropped an offer to acquire
Blacks Leisure and Numis Securities Ltd. upgraded it to “buy”
from “hold.”  Sports Direct declined to comment further, The Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
