Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  will offer
its customers  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s HBO Go mobile-TV application,
following months of negotiations with its former parent.  HBO Go and MAX Go are expected to start service in the next
month, New York-based Time Warner Cable said yesterday in a
statement. The cable company was once part of Time Warner, the
media company that is now focused on its television channels and
Warner Bros. movie and TV production.  HBO Go, a so-called TV Everywhere product, allows HBO
subscribers to watch more than 1,400 old and current programs,
including “The Sopranos” and “True Blood,” on Internet-
connected personal computers, mobile phones and tablet
computers. Users can watch shows when they choose, rather than
when they’re broadcast.  MAX Go, from HBO’s sister channel, Cinemax, offers 400
titles.  Time Warner Cable is the largest pay-TV provider that
hasn’t signed an agreement for the HBO Go application, which has
been downloaded for use on iPhones, iPads and other devices more
than 5 million times. The  Apple (AAPL)  and Android apps were introduced
on April 29.  Time Warner Cable fell less than 1 percent to $62.21
yesterday in  New York . The shares have declined 5.8 percent this
year. Time Warner, also based in New York, added 2.1 percent to
$34.59 and has gained 7.5 percent year-to-date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
