Departing European Central Bank
Executive Board Member Juergen Stark said he quit the ECB out of
disappointment over “how this monetary union has evolved,”
 WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing an interview.  The ECB fulfilled its role of maintaining  price stability 
and warned euro area governments early on of potential problems,
the magazine cited Stark as saying in an e-mailed preview of an
article to be published Monday. Governments, not monetary policy
makers, have the tools to curtail undesirable trends such as
rising real estate prices, WiWo cited him as saying.  “Don’t ask too much of the central bank,” the magazine
quoted Stark as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
