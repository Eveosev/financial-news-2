Investor AB (INVEA) , the Wallenberg family’s
publicly traded holding company, may be interested in acquiring
a minority stake in  Austria ’s  Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich
AG , Wiener Zeitung reported, citing market speculation.  Norway’s sovereign-wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment
Management, may also be interested in the Austrian lender, which
owns a majority stake in  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , the
Vienna-based paper said.  RZB’s plan to sell new shares and  Oesterreichische
Volksbanken AG (VBPS) ’s desire to sell its 5 percent stake in RZB could
provide Investor AB and Norges with an opportunity, according to
the report.  The Austrian lender, which had a capital gap of 2.1 billion
euros ($2.7 billion) in the most recent round of European Union
stress tests, in turn is seeking a partner for  Uniqa
Versicherungen AG (UQA) , the paper said.  RZB also is mulling selling its 25 percent stake in credit
card company Card Complete, Wiener said. The bank also owns a
stake in debit and credit card company PayLife, the paper said.
RZB’s rival  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  also holds a PayLife stake and
wants to sell it, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
