The U.S. is “deeply” concerned
that  Hungary ’s democracy is weakening as the government
“eliminates” checks and balances on its power, news website
 hvg.hu  reported late yesterday, citing Thomas O. Melia, Deputy
Assistant Secretary at the Department of State.  A draft law which would curb the power of the central bank
is the latest in a series of measures that add to the worries
the U.S. government has over Hungary, hvg.hu said, citing an
interview with Melia.  Hungary’s ruling party’s action of filling the judiciary
with its own people also threatens the independence of that
branch of the state, Melia told the website. The proposed
changes on the governance of the central bank are “even more
problematic” because they may undermine an institution central
to the working of the free market, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
