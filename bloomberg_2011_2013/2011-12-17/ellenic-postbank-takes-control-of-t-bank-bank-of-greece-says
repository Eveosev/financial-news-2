The Bank of  Greece  put  T Bank SA ’s
deposits, personnel, and banking activities under the control of
state-owned  TT Hellenic Postbank SA (TT) , saying the lender wasn’t
able to raise enough capital to keep operating.  “This action was taken because of the inability of T Bank
to restore its capital adequacy, despite the repeated efforts by
the Bank of Greece to correct T Bank’s weaknesses,” the  Bank of
Greece (TELL)  said in a statement on its website today. T Bank’s
license has been revoked and the bank’s assets are being
liquidated, it said.  T Bank, which is based in Athens, had 2.6 billion euros
($3.4 billion) in total assets at the end of the third quarter.
Hellenic Postbank, Greece’s sixth-biggest lender, owned 33
percent of T Bank and offered to buy the remaining equity in a
stock-for-stock bid in June.  From Dec. 19, “the whole branch network of T Bank will
operate normally, under the new ownership of Hellenic
Postbank,” Postbank said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
