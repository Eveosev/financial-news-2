Guy Quaden , a former  European
Central Bank  governing council member, said the ECB should
consider expanding its purchases of sovereign bonds now that the
euro area is cracking down on budget deficits, Le Soir reported.  “The ECB should perhaps contemplate intervening in a more
resolute manner,” Quaden, who retired as Belgian central bank
governor in March, told the Brussels-based paper in an  interview 
published today. The ECB, which began buying  government bonds  on
the secondary market in May 2010, has said the program is
“limited.”  Four days after Jens Weidmann, who heads Germany’s
Bundesbank, said he is “not a fan” of the ECB’s bond purchases
and its policy makers are becoming more skeptical about the
program, Quaden also told Le Soir that the ECB should be
independent “not only vis-à-vis governments, but also vis-à-vis
the Bundesbank.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
