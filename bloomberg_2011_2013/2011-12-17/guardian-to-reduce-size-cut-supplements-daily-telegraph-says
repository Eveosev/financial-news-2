Guardian Media Group Plc will trim
the size of the  Guardian newspaper  in Britain and cut or reduce
supplements to help stem losses of more than 40 million pounds
($62.2 million) a year, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  Guardian Media, propped up by the  Scott Trust , is focusing
on a “digital-first” strategy and seeking to simplify its
production through changes starting in January, the company’s
spokesman told the Daily Telegraph in an article today.  Guardian Media, which also publishes the Observer, will end
publication of the Guardian’s film and music supplement, reduce
to twice a week its sport supplement and reduce the number of
pages in its G2 supplement, according to the Daily Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
