A  New Zealand  military plane will
drop equipment and fuel to a stricken Russian fishing boat in
Antarctica’s Ross Sea today, after the ship’s hull was punctured
by ice.  Crew aboard the vessel Sparta made good progress working
overnight to stabilize the vessel, the Rescue Coordination
Centre New Zealand said in an update on Maritime New Zealand’s
website. A C130 Hercules will set off this morning,  Maritime New
Zealand  said in an e-mailed statement.  Sparta, with 32 crew aboard, sent a distress call at about
3 a.m. local time from a position next to the Antarctic ice
shelf, about 2,000 nautical miles (2,302 miles) southeast of New
Zealand.  The 48-meter ship hit underwater ice that put a 30
centimeter hole in its hull below the waterline, causing it to
take on water and list 13 degrees,  Maritime New Zealand  said.  “They’ve made good progress -- the vessel is certainly in
a safer position than it was yesterday,”  Chris Wilson , search
and rescue mission coordinator, said in the statement today.
“The crew, which left the vessel yesterday as a precautionary
measure, are now back on board.”  The crew face several days wait for rescue, as three ships
making their way toward Sparta are being severely hampered by
heavy sea ice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
