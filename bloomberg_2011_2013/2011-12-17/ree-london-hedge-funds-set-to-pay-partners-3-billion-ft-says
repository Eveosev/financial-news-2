Three of  London ’s biggest hedge
funds are likely to pay their top partners a total of more than
$3 billion this year, the Financial Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The expected payouts by Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP,
BlueCrest Capital Management Services Ltd. and Winton Capital
Management Ltd. follow investment successes at the firms even as
the industry as a whole lost an average of 4.3 percent of
investor money, the newspaper said today, citing Hedge Fund
Research.  Brevan’s main fund, which manages $25 billion and made its
investors 13 percent over the past year, generated fees of $1.5
billion, according to the article. BlueCrest and Winton could
generate fees of $600 million and $700 million, respectively,
the FT said. Some of the success is attributed to correctly
betting on a slow recovery in the euro region, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
