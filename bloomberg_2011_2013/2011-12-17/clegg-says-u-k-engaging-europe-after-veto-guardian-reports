U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  told the Guardian that Britain is already working with
 Europe  to get “back into the mainstream of the debate” after
Prime Minister David Cameron’s veto of a euro-rescue treaty.  The government is taking “very big steps” to re-engage
with Europe after the veto at this month’s summit, and jabs
against the U.K. yesterday by French Prime Minister Francois Fillon show Britain is caught in the cross-fire of  France ’s
presidential election, Clegg told the newspaper. France and
England always work through their differences, he said.  “I just think we all need to go away, have a bit of
hiatus, a bit of time to have Christmas, to eat some mince pies
or whatever the French equivalent is,” Clegg told the Guardian.
“Everyone is a bit tired.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
