Spanish  and Italian notes advanced,
leading gains in euro-area debt, on speculation banks bought the
securities to use as collateral when the  European Central Bank 
starts offering three-year loans next week.  Spain ’s  two-year yields  fell to a four-month low after the
nation sold almost double its initial maximum target of
securities at an auction on Dec. 16. French and  Belgian notes 
gained for a third week before the ECB starts its longer-term
refinancing operation on Dec. 20. German and  Dutch two-year 
yields dropped to euro-era records as some investors remained
concerned the European debt crisis will worsen, underpinning
demand for the region’s safest assets.  “The ECB’s refinancing operation is driving demand for
shorter-dated European paper,” said Gianluca Ziglio, an
interest-rate strategist at UBS AG in  London . “After the
Spanish auction, we are now going into a relatively quiet phase
for issuance,” which puts less pressure on Spanish and Italian
securities, he said.  Two-year  Spanish yields  fell 122 basis points, or 1.22
percentage points, this week to 3.45 percent at 4:40 p.m. in
London yesterday. The 2.5 percent note due October 2013 gained
2.13, or 21.30 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,303) face amount, to
98.31. The yields dropped to 3.10 percent yesterday, the lowest
since Aug. 9.  Italian two-year yields slid 61 basis points this week to
5.35 percent, extending their decline from a euro-era record
8.12 percent on Nov. 28.  Access to Funds  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on Dec. 8 he would offer
banks cash for three years to improve their access to liquidity.
When the operations start next week, the companies can borrow
unlimited funds from the central bank in return for eligible
collateral, including euro-region  government bonds .  Belgian  two-year yields  fell 70 basis points this week to
2.60 percent, extending their three-week decline to 248 basis
points. Similar-maturity French rates dropped 17 basis points to
0.91 percent.  German  two-year rates  fell 10 basis points over the week to
0.22 percent, and touched a record of 0.214 percent yesterday.
Dutch two-year yields dropped nine basis points to 0.3 percent,
after falling to a euro-era low 0.293 percent.  Economists say an industry report next week will show
 German business confidence  declined in December, spurring demand
for safer assets. The Munich-based Ifo institute’s business
climate index, based on a survey of executives, fell to 106 from
106.6 in November, according to a Bloomberg News survey before
the data is released on Dec. 20.  Spanish government bonds have returned 4.6 percent this
year through Dec. 15, according to indexes compiled by the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and
Bloomberg. German bunds gained 9 percent, Italian debt dropped 7
percent and French bonds rose 4.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
