The Senate today confirmed Michael
McFaul, the top White House adviser on Russian affairs, as the
next U.S. ambassador to the Russian Federation.  McFaul, author of “The Liberty Doctrine” in Policy Review
magazine in 2002, which compared and contrasted the  Cold War  to
the Bush administration’s reaction to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, will be taking office as Russia was accepted as a
member of the  World Trade Organization  this week after 18 years
of negotiations.  McFaul, senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs at
the White House National Security Council, was a political
science professor at  Stanford University  from 1995 to 2009,
according to a White House statement. While at Stanford, he was
a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and was co-director of
the Iran Democracy Project at Hoover from 2003 to 2009.  McFaul holds a bachelor’s degree in international relations
and Slavic languages, and a master’s degree in Russian and East
European Studies, both from Stanford. McFaul received a
doctorate in international Relations from Oxford University in
1991, where he was a Rhodes scholar.  Obama, who is pressing Congress to scrap a 1974 law
limiting trade with  Russia , called Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  yesterday to offer his congratulations on his country’s
accession to the WTO. Once the U.S. law is eliminated, the two
governments can have so-called permanent normal trade relations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
