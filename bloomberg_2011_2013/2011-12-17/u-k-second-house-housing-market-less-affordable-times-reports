U.K. home owners seeking to buy a
house for a second time are less able to do so than at any time
in the past 24 years,  The Times  reported, citing a report from
Lloyds Bank Group Plc.  The affordability ratio for second-step buyers is 5.2, up
from 3.0 10 years ago, the London-based newspaper cited the
Lloyds TSB Homeownersâ€™ Review as saying. The ratio for first-
time buyers is 4.1, it said.  Affordability for second-steppers is calculated by taking
the average price of a semi-detached house, minus the equity in
a first home as a ratio of average earnings, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
