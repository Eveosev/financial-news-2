The Swiss central bank is in
“permanent crisis mode,” Swiss National Bank President Philipp Hildebrand told  Radio DRS 1 .  “We’ve been in permanent crisis mode for four and a half
years,” Hildebrand said. Policy makers are “permanently
dealing with new developments that we have to cushion as well as
possible, and prepare ourselves for any further developments.”  Hildebrand said uncertainty about how the sovereign-debt
crisis will develop is affecting the Swiss economy. He also said
he’s concerned about the real-estate market.  “The combination of economic, financial and at the same
time a real-estate crisis -- that would really hurt for the long
term,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
