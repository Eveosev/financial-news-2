Three people in  Nigeria ’s
northeastern Borno State, suspected of belonging to a militant
Islamic sect, died in a blast today while trying to make a bomb,
said Haruna Mohammed, a spokesman for a military task force in
the region.  The task force found explosives, guns and ammunition at the
house where the explosion happened, Mohammed said in an
interview.  “We discovered that the house was confirmed to be used by
the Boko Haram sect for the production of improvised explosive
devices,” he said. “This is the first major IED factory we
have discovered in Borno state.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
