More companies are borrowing from
 capital markets  as banks become reluctant to lend to them,  Neue
Luzerner Zeitung  reported, citing Marco Illy, vice chairman of
Credit Suisse investment bank.  “The higher capital requirements and tensions in the
inter-banking market lead banks to be more reluctant in giving
out corporate loans,” Illy was cited as saying.  This forces companies to borrow money from capital markets,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
