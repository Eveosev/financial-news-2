Companies in  London ’s Canary Wharf
district are working with  Olympic Games  officials to avoid a
standstill in business during the event next year as a result of
possible transportation problems, the Guardian reported.  As much as 80 percent of workers in Canary Wharf’s banks,
law firms and accounting companies may arrange to stay away from
the area or take vacation during the Games, which run from July
27 to Aug. 12, the newspaper reported today.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Britain’s biggest bank, is among
companies working with officials on alternative arrangements
during the event, including having “the vast majority” of the
bank’s 8,500 London employees work from home or use other
offices, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
