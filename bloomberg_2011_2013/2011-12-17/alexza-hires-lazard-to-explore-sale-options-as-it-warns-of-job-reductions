Alexza Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ALXA) , the
maker of an inhaled antipsychotic therapy backed by a U.S.
advisory panel, said the company hired Lazard Ltd. to explore
strategic options including selling itself.  Alexza also expects to “significantly reduce its
workforce” to conserve cash as it seeks Food and Drug
Administration and European approval for its experimental
treatment, Adasuve, the  Mountain View , California-based company
said today in a statement. The drugmaker had 97 employees at the
end of 2010, according to Bloomberg data.  An FDA advisory panel on Dec. 12 recommended approval of
Adasuve in a 9-8 vote contingent upon the company using a risk
mitigation plan proposed by the agency. The therapy, which would
be Alexza’s first marketed product, uses an inhalation device
developed by the company to deliver a vaporized form of the drug
loxapine to the lungs for rapid absorption into the bloodstream.
Alexza said it has a partnership with closely held Grupo Ferrer
Internacional SA, based in Barcelona, Spain, to commercialize
the product in  Europe .  Alexza’s shares fell 2.9 percent to 66 cents at the close
of New York trading and have declined 47 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
