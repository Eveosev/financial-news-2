The  Los Angeles Kings  will hire
Darryl Sutter as coach, the  Los Angeles  Times reported on its
website.  Sutter will replace Terry Murray, who was fired Dec. 12.
He’ll be introduced at a press conference on Dec. 20, the Times
said, citing a person familiar with the situation it didn’t
identify.  Sutter, 53, previously coached the Chicago Blackhawks, San
Jose Sharks and Calgary Flames, which he led to the Stanley Cup
Final in 2004.  Los Angeles is fourth in the National Hockey League’s
Pacific Division with a 14-13-4 record. Assistant John Stevens
has coached the team since Murray’s firing and is expected to
remain on the Kings’ staff under Sutter, the Times said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
