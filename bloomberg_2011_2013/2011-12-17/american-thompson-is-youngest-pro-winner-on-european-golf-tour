American teenager Lexi Thompson won
golf’s Dubai Ladies Masters by four strokes to become the
youngest professional winner on the Ladies European Tour.  Thompson shot 5-under-par 67 today to finish at 15-under at
the Emirates Golf Club. It was the 16-year-old’s second
professional victory after becoming the youngest winner on the
LPGA Tour at the Navistar Classic in September.  Thompson is the second-youngest winner of a Ladies European
Tour event.  South Korea ’s Amy Yang was four months younger when
she won the ANZ Ladies Masters in  Australia  as an amateur in
2006.  South Africa’s Lee-Anne Pace finished second at 11-under
with Sweden’s Sophie Gustafson a shot further back.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
