Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann’s
office opposes  Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) ’s plan to create
a “non-core business” unit for assets it wants to wind down or
sell,  Der Standard  reported, citing “well informed people” it
didn’t identify.  Faymann’s office is concerned that the bad bank may be a
step toward a third nationalized lender after Kommunalkredit
Austria AG and Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG, the
Vienna-based newspaper said. Government representatives want to
avoid that the state has to cover the risk of the unit,
according to the paper.  In a plan which “isn’t met with enthusiasm” by
Volksbanken’s owners, the lender wants its shareholders to
assist in financing the wind-down unit, Standard said, citing
nobody. The lender is majority owned by 62 cooperative banks,
with German cooperative lender  DZ Bank , a  Munich Re (MUV2)  unit and
 Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG  holding minority stakes.  In a separate interview with Standard, Faymann was cited as
saying that Volksbanken and Hypo Alpe were speaking with the
government regarding potential refinancing difficulties.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
