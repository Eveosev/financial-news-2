Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti’s
government has committed to holding an auction for six digital-
television frequencies after supporting requests presented by
opposition lawmakers.  Piero Giarda, minister for parliamentary affairs, told the
lower house of Parliament late yesterday that the government
favored separate motions submitted by the  Northern League  and
Italian Values parties. Both motions require the government to
withdraw current plans to assign the frequencies to Italy’s main
broadcasters and auction them instead.  Both  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  Chief Executive Officer Franco Bernabe and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who
controls broadcaster  Mediaset SpA (MS) , have said that no one would
bid for the frequencies should the government auction them.
Telecom controls La7, a national broadcaster.  The government must pass a decree to hold the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
