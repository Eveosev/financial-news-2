Guinea plans to increase spending to
11.5 trillion Guinean francs ($1.59 billion) in 2012 as
government revenue climbs, Budget Minister Mohamed Diare said.  “The main part of those resources will be allocated to
agriculture development, parliamentary elections, energy and
roads,” Diare told lawmakers, according to a statement handed
to reporters today in Conakry, the capital.  The National Transitional Council, the country’s
legislative body, approved in October revised budget spending of
10.1 trillion francs for 2011.  Revenue in the West African nation is forecast to jump to
9.5 trillion francs next year from 6 trillion francs, Diare
said. The economy will probably expand 4.7 percent in 2012, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
