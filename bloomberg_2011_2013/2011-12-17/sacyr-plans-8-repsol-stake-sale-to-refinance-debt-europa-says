Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  is close to
selling an 8 percent stake in  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  to either  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , known as Sinopec, or to a Latin
American company,  Europa Press  said, citing unidentified people
close to the matter.  The deal, which could be closed in the next few days, would
allow Sacyr to cancel about half the 4.9 billion-euro ($6.4
billion) loan that financed its 20 percent stake in the oil
company, the newswire said.  Sacyr is also seeking to reach an agreement with lenders to
refinance the rest of the loan, extending its payment by three
years, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
