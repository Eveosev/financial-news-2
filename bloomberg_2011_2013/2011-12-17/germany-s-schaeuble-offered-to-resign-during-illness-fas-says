German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  twice offered to resign in 2010 during an illness,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  said, citing an
interview.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel  rejected both resignations and
Schaeuble has since returned to health, the newspaper cited
Schaeuble as saying.  Schaeuble had been “optimistic” about securing changes in
European Union treaties during the most recent round of crisis
talks, the newspaper cited him as saying. “Now the
implementation and communication is more complicated,” he told
the newspaper. “I would have welcomed a simpler and clearer
message for the markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
