U.K. 10-year gilts rose for a second
week, pushing yields to a record low, amid speculation the euro
area’s debt crisis is still far from resolved, boosting demand
for safer assets.  Two-year yields also reached a record low as reports showed
unemployment surged and retail sales fell more than economists
forecast in November, making it more likely that the  Bank of
England  will add to its asset-purchase program. Gilts rose with
Treasuries yesterday after a Labor Department report showed U.S.
consumer prices stagnated last month, supporting the  Federal
Reserve ’s view that inflation remains in check.  “Gilts have been buoyed due to the peripheral euro-zone
fear, which has kicked on a level,” said Lee McDarby, head of
dealing on the corporate and institutional treasury desk at
Investec Bank Plc in  London . “There appears to be no real
answers to the euro-zone issue and the U.K. has stood alone and
distanced itself.”  Ten-year gilt yields decreased 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 2.04 percent at 4:59 p.m. London time
yesterday. Earlier that day, it reached 2.049 percent, the least
since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1992. The 3.75
percent bond due September 2021 rose 1.08, or 10.8 pounds per
1,000-pound ($1,551) face amount, to 114.97. Two-year yields
fell eight basis points to 0.31 percent after touching a record
0.309 percent.  The pound fell 1 percent this week to $1.5514. It
strengthened 1.7 percent against the euro since Dec. 9, to 83.98
pence.  Pound Gains  Sterling has risen 2.8 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar added 5.3 percent and
the yen climbed 2.4 percent.  Investors bought British securities as an alternative to
assets denominated in the euro as European Union leaders
struggled to solve a debt crisis that has forced  Greece , Ireland
and  Portugal  to seek international bailouts. The turmoil has
also engulfed Italy and  Spain  and prompted the bloc to create
funds to help stricken economies.  Gilts may extend their gain next week on speculation a
report will show  consumer confidence  slipped further this month,
after dropping in November to its lowest level in more than 2
1/2 years. An index of sentiment fell to minus 32, from minus 31
in November, London-based research group GfK NOP Ltd. will say
on Dec. 20, according to the median prediction of 17 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank of England Chief Economist  Spencer Dale  said in an
interview this week that policy makers have scope to expand
their 275 billion-pound bond-buying program to aid an economy
facing at least one quarter of contraction by the middle of
2012.  Gilts have returned 16 percent this year through Dec. 15,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
9 percent and Italian bonds lost 7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
