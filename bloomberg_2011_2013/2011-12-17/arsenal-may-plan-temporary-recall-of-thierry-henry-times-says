Arsenal may try to temporarily
re-sign club-record goal scorer  Thierry Henry , the London-based
Times reported.  Club manager  Arsene Wenger  hasnâ€™t approached Henry or his
current team, the New York Red Bulls, about it, the newspaper
reported, citing Wenger.  Henry, who has been training with Arsenal for a month, is
scheduled to return to the U.S. on Jan. 15 ahead of the start of
the Major League Soccer season in March, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
