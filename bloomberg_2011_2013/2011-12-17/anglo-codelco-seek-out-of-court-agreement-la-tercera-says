Codelco, Chile’s state-owned copper
company, and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  are seeking an out-of-court
resolution to their dispute over the sale of Anglo’s Sur unit,
 La Tercera reported  today, citing unidentified people with
knowledge of the matter.  Company executives have met in New York since suggesting on
Nov. 24 at the Mining Council’s annual dinner that they wanted
to seek a settlement, the Santiago-based newspaper said.  Codelco is seeking to overturn Anglo’s sale of 24.5 percent
of its Sur unit to  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  The Santiago-based company
says the transaction impedes it from exercising an option to buy
as much as 49 percent of the Sur unit.  Anglo has said its contract with Codelco allows the sale of
Sur shares to others before Codelco can exercise the option.
Codelco is permitted to exercise the option in the month of
January every three years until 2027.  To contact the reporter on this story:
