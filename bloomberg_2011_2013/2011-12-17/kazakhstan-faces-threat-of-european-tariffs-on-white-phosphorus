The European Union threatened to
impose tariffs on white phosphorus from  Kazakhstan  to limit
competition for Dutch producer Thermphos International BV.  The EU opened an inquiry into whether Kazakh manufacturers
of the chemical sell it in the 27-nation bloc below cost, a
practice known as dumping. White phosphorus is used to make
derivatives including chlorides, sulphides and phosphoric acid,
according to the  website  of Thermphos International.  The EU probe will determine whether imports of white
phosphorus from Kazakhstan are “being dumped and whether this
dumping has caused injury to the union industry,” the European
Commission, the bloc’s trade authority in Brussels, said today
in the  Official Journal . The commission has nine months to
decide whether to impose provisional anti-dumping duties for
half a year and EU governments have 15 months to decide whether
to apply “definitive” levies for five years.  The dumping investigation stems from a Nov. 7 complaint by
Thermphos International, which is the EU’s sole producer of
white phosphorus, according to the commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
