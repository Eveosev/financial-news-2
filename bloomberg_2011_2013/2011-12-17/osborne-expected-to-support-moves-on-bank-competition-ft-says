U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  is expected to give his support on Dec. 19 to
calls for more competition in retail banking, the Financial
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  Virgin Money Holdings U.K. Ltd.’s purchase of the
nationalized lender Northern Rock Plc last month and Co-
Operative Group Ltd.’s selection as the preferred bidder for 632
 Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY)  branches, may be highlighted as moves in
the right direction by Osborne, who’s responding to proposals in
September from the Independent Commission on Banking, the
newspaper said today.  Osborne may also urge banks to proceed with plans to make
it easier for customers to switch current accounts to different
providers, the FT said. He will support the ICB’s proposal to
ring-fence retail banking operations to make them safer from
riskier investment banking businesses, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
