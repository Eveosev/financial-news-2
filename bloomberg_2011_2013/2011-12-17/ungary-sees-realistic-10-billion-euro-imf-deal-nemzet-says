Hungary would like to secure its
financing over the next two years with a 10 billion-euro ($13.1
billion) International Monetary Fund credit line,  Magyar Nemzet 
said, citing Mihaly Varga, the prime minister’s chief of staff.  “Based on the most realistic scenario that’s in front of
the government, an IMF credit line of at least 10 billion euros
would secure financing during the remaining two years of the
current government cycle,” Varga said in an interview with the
Budapest-based daily newspaper published today.  For a longer period than two years, a credit line of
between 15 billion euros to 20 billion euros is “also
imaginable,” Varga said.  Hungary may delay certain investments or developments and
may further cut ministries’ spending in the 2012  budget  “if
push comes to shove,” according to Varga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
