China  may introduce an environment
protection tax by the end of 2015, the official Xinhua News
Agency  reported  today, citing Jia Kang, head of the Chinese
Finance Ministryâ€™s research institute for fiscal science.  The country may start levying the environment protection
tax to boost fiscal revenue and make room for adjustments in
corporate tax, Jia was quoted as saying in a conference in
 Shanghai  today.  The government will also raise spending next year on
agriculture, social welfare such as low-cost housing, and
medical reform, the report said, citing Jia.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
