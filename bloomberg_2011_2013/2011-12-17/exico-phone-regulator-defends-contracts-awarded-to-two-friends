Mexico ’s top phone-industry
regulator said contracts awarded by his agency to two friends
were vetted by other officials and had no bearing on policy
decisions.  The Federal Telecommunications Commission has 140 contracts
with outside suppliers, and all, including two cited today by
Reuters in a  report , must be approved by the agency’s
Acquisitions Committee, Mony de Swaan, the commission’s
president, said in an e-mail.  De Swaan approved contracts worth about $200,000 to two
people with whom he has personal friendships, Reuters reported
today. The contracts were signed in August by de Swaan, who has
held his post for 18 months, Reuters said.  “I have 14 years as a public servant that back up my
honesty, commitment and dedication,” de Swaan said in the e-
mail.  The two contracts were for legal and public-relations
services, and both helped further the agency’s goals, de Swaan
said. He said he has recused himself in unrelated deliberations
by the agency’s board when he has had a conflict of interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
