Oil headed for its biggest
quarterly decline since 2008 as U.S. economic reports failed to
ease investor concern that growth in the worldâ€™s largest crude
consumer will slow.  Futures for November delivery were at $82.13 a barrel, down
1 cent, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 3:17 p.m. Singapore time. The contract has dropped
14 percent since June 30, the biggest quarterly decline since
the three months ended Dec. 31, 2008.  Brent oil for November fell 18 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$103.77 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
