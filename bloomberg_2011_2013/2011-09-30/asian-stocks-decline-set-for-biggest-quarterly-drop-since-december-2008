Asian stocks dropped for the first
time in four days, with the regional benchmark index posting its
biggest quarterly decline since December 2008, as U.S. economic
reports failed to soothe investor concern that growth in the
world’s largest economy is faltering.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., sank 3.6 percent in Hong Kong.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the
world’s largest maker of plasma televisions, slid 1.2 percent in
 Tokyo . Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 44 percent of
sales from North America, fell 1.4 percent. Glencore
International Plc, the world’s No. 1 commodities trader, tumbled
8 percent as copper futures headed for the biggest quarterly
decline since 2008.  “Sentiment ebbs and flows very quickly nowadays,” said
 Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “People are still very
uncertain about the macro-economic outlook at this stage and
risk-off prevails until greater certainty comes to light in
policy response.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.8 percent to 113.20 as
of 4:40 p.m. in Mumbai, after swinging between gains and losses
at least six times. About five stocks fell for every four that
rose in the measure, which advanced 1.3 percent this week.  The gauge lost 9.4 percent this month, extending a slump
this quarter to 16 percent, the steepest drop since the three
months ended December 2008. Stocks have plunged amid concern the
global economy is poised for another recession as Europe’s debt
crisis worsens and U.S. economic growth slows.  Nikkei, Hang Seng  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 2.3 percent at the
close, extending the quarter’s slump to 21 percent, the worst
performance since September 2001.  China ’s Shanghai Composite
Index slid 0.3 percent.  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average,  South Korea ’s Kospi Index
and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 were little changed, while futures
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.3 percent.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.8 percent yesterday in  New York  after
applications for jobless benefits dropped and the economy grew
at a faster pace than initially estimated in the second quarter.  Reports today showed global economic growth may be slowing.
German retail sales slumped in August, industrial production in
Japan and South Korea grew less than economists forecast, and
Chinese manufacturing shrank for a third month. Data in the U.S.
is expected to show spending by American consumers slowed in
last month.  Toyota, Li & Fung  Exporters declined. Li & Fung slumped 3.6 percent to
HK$13.22 in  Hong Kong . Panasonic, which counts the U.S. as its
biggest market, dropped 1.2 percent to 754 yen. Honda fell 1.4
percent to 2,299 yen.  A gauge of raw-material producers and consumer companies
was among the top three biggest industry declines in the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index as copper futures lost as much as 1.8
percent, headed for the biggest quarterly drop since 2008.  Glencore tumbled 8 percent to HK$48.65. Jiangxi Copper Co.,
China’s largest producer of the metal, sank 4.2 percent to
HK$13.80. Rio Tinto Group, a mining company by sales, slipped 1
percent to A$61.80.  Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd., China’s No. 2
electronics retailer, slumped 22 percent to HK$1.83 in Hong
Kong, the biggest decline on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Credit
Suisse Group AG cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from
“outperform,” citing concerns on corporate governance.  Bribery, Insider Trading  The Beijing-based retailer said Sept. 27 it will form a
venture with units associated with billionaire founder Wong Kwong Yu, who is serving a 14-year jail term on bribery and
insider trading charges, to increase the number of stores in
China.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined about 18 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with a 7.7 percent drop by the
S&P 500 and a 17 percent loss by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 11.6 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 11.7 times for the
S&P 500 and 9.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  Global equities advanced yesterday after  Germany ’s lower
house of parliament approved the expansion of the European
bailout fund. The bill’s passage by Europe’s biggest economy
allows euro-area officials to weigh further measures to bolster
Greece in its sovereign-debt crisis and stem investor concern.  To contact the reporters on this story:
