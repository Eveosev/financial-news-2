The  Philippines  may still sell
global debt and hold a bond exchange this year “if there is
opportunity,” Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima told a media
briefing today in  Manila .  The Philippines has a remaining $500 million overseas debt
sale on its 2011 funding plan. “We are considering all
instruments but we haven’t started formal discussions,”
Purisima said when asked on the possibility of offering
inflation-linked bonds next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
