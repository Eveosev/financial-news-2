Pre-harvest corn inventories in
the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and exporter, fell 34
percent from a year earlier, less than analysts forecast as
livestock producers used more wheat in feed rations.  Stockpiles on Sept. 1 totaled 1.128 billion bushels, down
from 1.708 billion a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey expected 942 million, on average. Corn usage in
the three months ended Aug. 31 was 2.54 billion bushels, down
from 2.6 billion a year earlier, the USDA said.  “U.S. livestock producers are substituting more wheat in
livestock rations,”  Dale Durchholz , a senior market analyst
at AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,  Illinois , said before the
report. “Increased wheat feeding outside of the U.S. may slow
export demand for corn in the coming months.”  Corn futures have gained 25 percent in the past year on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, partly on concern that hot, dry
weather damaged crops. The USDA earlier this month predicted a
harvest of 12.497 billion bushels (328.1 million metric tons),
up 0.4 percent from last year and down from 12.914 billion
forecast in August.  An estimated 15 percent of the crop was collected as of
Sept. 25, down from 26 percent a year earlier and the previous
five-year average of 16 percent, the USDA said this week.
Mostly dry weather will aid harvesting the next 10 days, T-
Storm Weather LLC said yesterday.  Corn Futures  Corn futures for December delivery rose 1.75 cents, or
0.3 percent, to close at $6.325 a bushel yesterday on the
CBOT. The most-active contract touched $6.23, the lowest price
since July 12.  “The biggest price factor for corn over the next month
will be the size of the upcoming harvest,” AgriVisor’s
Durchholz said before the report. “As prices moved lower the
past month, that may have improved demand for corn.”  Soybean inventories on Sept. 1 totaled 215 million
bushels, down from 225 million estimated on Sept. 12 and up
from the 151 million bushels a year earlier, the USDA said.
The average analyst estimate was 224 million bushels.  Consumption of the oilseed in the final quarter of the
marketing year that ended Aug. 31 fell to 405 million bushels
from 420 million a year earlier, the USDA said.  “No one is going begging for soybean supplies,”  Bill Nelson , a senior economist at St. Louis-based Doane Advisory
Services Co., said before the report. “Supplies in  South
America  are the second-highest ever and people are shifting
their focus to the start of the planting season this month in
 Argentina  and  Brazil .”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 6.5 cents, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $12.30 a bushel yesterday on the
Chicago, after touching $12.0925, the lowest level since Nov.
23. Before today, the commodity tumbled 16 percent this month
on speculation that  Europe ’s debt crisis will escalate and
reduce global commodity demand.  The U.S. harvest will total 3.085 billion bushels of
soybeans, down from 3.329 billion in 2010, the USDA said in a
Sept. 12 report. The agency will update its forecasts for corn
and soybean production on Oct. 12.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2008, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show. The U.S. is also the world’s largest producer and
exporter of soybeans, followed by Brazil and Argentina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
