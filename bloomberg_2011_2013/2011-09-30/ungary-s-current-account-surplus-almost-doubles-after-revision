Hungary’s second-quarter current-
account surplus nearly doubled from the previous three months
after the central bank slashed the first-quarter figure by more
than half as part of a multi-year revision due to methodology
changes.  The surplus was 738 million euros ($999 million), the
largest quarterly figure on record, compared with a revised 385
million euros in the January-March period and a revised 371
million euros a year earlier, the  Magyar Nemzeti Bank  said
today. That compares with a median estimate of a 750 million-
euro surplus in a Bloomberg survey of 10 economists.  The central bank revised data going back to 2005 after the
statistical office changed the calculation methodology for
tourism expenditures as well as trade in goods, the bank said.
The impact of the revisions on the balance calculated as a
percentage of gross domestic product was minus 1.6 percent in
the first quarter and minus 1 percent in 2010, according to the
central bank.  Hungary’s current-account balance has been improving as the
economy recovers from a contraction of 6.7 percent in 2009, its
worst in 18 years, which sapped consumer demand and reduced
industrial output. The government expects a current-account
surplus of 3.7 percent of GDP in 2012,  Mihaly Varga , the prime
minister’s chief of staff, said yesterday.  Hungary’s net external financing capacity, or the combined
surplus of the current and capital accounts, was an adjusted 3.3
percent of GDP in the second quarter.  The country had a surplus of 2.4 billion euros in the trade
of goods and services, while direct investment income showed a
deficit of 1.2 billion euros. Current transfers from the EU had
a surplus of 327 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
