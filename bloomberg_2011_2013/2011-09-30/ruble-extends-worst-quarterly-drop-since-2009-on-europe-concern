The ruble weakened for a third day
against the dollar, extending its worst quarterly depreciation
since 2009 as concern over slowing European growth drove down
prices for oil.  Russia ’s currency depreciated 1.2 percent to 32.23 per
dollar by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow. The ruble has fallen 13
percent against the greenback this quarter, the biggest drop
since the three-month period ended March 31, 2009.  German retail sales declined the most in more than four
years in August as concern  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis will
worsen sapped consumers’ willingness to spend. Urals crude oil
lost 0.5 percent to $102.74 a barrel, headed for the worst
quarterly drop since June 2010. Companies were due to pay about
1.5 trillion rubles ($46.7 billion) in taxes by today,  Alfa Bank 
analysts wrote in a note Sept. 16.  “ Oil prices  edged weaker and the taxation period, which
usually provides some support for the ruble, comes to an end,”
Carolin Hecht, a currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said by e-mail.  Exporters convert dollar-denominated revenues into rubles
to pay taxes at the end of each month, buoying the Russian
currency. Urals has dropped 6.5 percent this quarter.  The ruble was 0.3 percent stronger at 43.29 per euro today,
leaving it down 0.4 percent at 37.207 against the basket.  Ruble Target Cut  Alfa Bank cut its year-end ruble forecast 6.5 percent to 31
per dollar, citing a “deterioration of the capital account
outlook,” in a research note yesterday. Capital outflows from
Russia may reach $60 billion this year, compared with an earlier
forecast for $50 billion, Chief Economist Natalia Orlova wrote.  “Demand for foreign currency picked up on fears that
European banks will be unable to refinance Russian foreign
debt,” Orlova wrote.  Russia’s current-account surplus, the broadest measure of
trade in goods and services, narrowed in the second quarter to
$23.8 billion from a revised $32.5 billion in the previous three
months, the central bank said on its website today.  Investors increased bets the ruble will depreciate further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing it dropping to 32.7998 per
dollar in three months’ time, compared with 32.4355 yesterday.
NDFs provide a guide to expectations of currency movements and
interest-rate differentials.  Russia’s only ruble Eurobond rallied, pushing the yield
down two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.186
percent. Sovereign dollar bonds due in 2020 fell, with the yield
up four basis points at 5.182 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
