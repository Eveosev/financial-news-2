Serbia  may join the  World Trade
Organization  in 2012 instead of expected accession this year
because it is still negotiating a free trade agreement with
Ukraine,  Tanjug  news agency reported, citing Economy Minister
Nebojsa Ciric.  Serbia has concluded bilateral talks with other states
required for WTO membership and apart from Ukraine only has
minor “technical details” to work out with Brazil and the
U.S., the report quoted Ciric as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
