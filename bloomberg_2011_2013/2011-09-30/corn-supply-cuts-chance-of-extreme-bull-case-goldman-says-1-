A government report today that
showed larger U.S. corn inventories than forecast has cut the
“probability of an extreme bull case” for prices, analysts at
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said.  Corn supplies totaled 1.128 billion bushels as of Sept. 1,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. That’s 20 percent
higher than 942 million expected on average in a Bloomberg
survey of 24 analysts. Prices are headed for the biggest monthly
drop in at least five decades and plunged to a three-month low
today in Chicago.  Today’s data signaled a “greater inventory cushion,”
Goldman analysts Lindsay Drucker Mann,  Robert Koort  and Evan
Stampler said in the e-mailed report. “We continue to project
weak feed demand and limited ethanol production growth.”  Stockpiles outpaced forecasts as consumption in the U.S.
fell 2.3 percent from a year earlier to 2.54 billion bushels in
the three-months ended Aug. 31. Demand dropped after prices
rallied to a three-year high in June on adverse weather
concerns. Futures tumbled in September amid concern that slowing
global growth will trim commodity demand. The U.S. is the
world’s biggest user, producer and exporter of the grain.  Today’s Trading  Corn futures for December delivery tumbled the 40-cent
exchange limit, or 6.3 percent, to $5.925 a bushel on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade, the lowest for a most-active contract
since July 1. The price lost 23 percent for September, capping
the biggest monthly decline in records going back to 1959.  Still, demand for U.S. exports may continue to support
prices, the analysts said. The bank maintained its $7 forecast
for the season that began Sept. 1.  “Stronger exports driven by tight global corn inventories
and competitive U.S. prices will offset the larger supply,”
Goldman said.  U.S. reserves before the 2012 harvest will fall to 669
million bushels, or 5.2 percent of consumption, down from 8.5
percent estimated for this year, Goldman said. U.S. corn
production this year may fall to 12.426 billion bushels from
12.447 billion last year, the analyst said. On Sept. 12, the
USDA forecast this season’s harvest at 12.497 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
