The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt rose, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 25.5
basis points to 883.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices
at 7:30 a.m. in  London .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was up 6.75 at 213.25 basis points. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers rose 11 basis points to 300 basis points and the
subordinated index was up 13 at 555.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
