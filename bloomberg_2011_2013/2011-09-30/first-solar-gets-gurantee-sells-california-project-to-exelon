(Corrects financing details in fifth paragraph.)  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
largest maker of thin-film solar panels, sold two power projects
in California that received U.S. Energy Department loan
guarantees.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  bought the company’s 230-megawatt Antelope
Valley Solar Ranch 1 project in Los Angeles County, and NextEra
Inc. and General Electric Co. bought its 550-megawatt Desert
Sunlight project in Riverside County, First Solar said today in
separate statements.  Exelon said it plans to invest as much as $1.36 billion in
Antelope Valley, which is expected to add to its earnings in
2013. First Solar didn’t give a price for the Desert Sunlight
sale. The solar company typically sells the projects it
develops.  The Energy Department announced today guarantees of $646
million for Antelope Valley and $1.46 billion for Desert
Sunlight.  The loan for Antelope Valley will come from the Treasury
Department’s Federal Financing Bank. Citigroup Inc. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. are providing debt financing for Desert
Sunlight.  Construction of Desert Sunlight is expected to be completed
by the first quarter of 2015, Alan Bernheimer, a spokesman for
Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar, said today in an e-mail.  PG&E
Corp. (PCG)  will buy 300-megawatts of output for 25 years, and  Edison
International (EIX) ’s Southern California Edison Co. will buy 250
megawatts for 20 years.  Antelope Valley is expected to be completed in late 2013,
and PG&E will buy the power for 25 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
