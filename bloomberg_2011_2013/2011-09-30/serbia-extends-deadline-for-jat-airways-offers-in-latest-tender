Serbia gave potential investors
another month to make offers for JAT Airways, the state-owned
flag carrier, as the initial deadline expired today.  The extension until Oct. 31 came “at the request of
interested parties to better prepare” their bids, the
Infrastructure Ministry said in an e-mailed statement, without
naming potential buyers.  The tender began on Aug. 1, when Serbia invited commercial
airlines and financial investors with at least a 5 percent
exposure to the airlines industry to take part in creating a new
national carrier with JAT Airways at its core.  If the third attempt to sell the unprofitable carrier
eventually fails, the authorities will try to overhaul the
company and renew JAT’s aging fleet of 10 Boeing 737-300s and
four turboprop ATR 72-200s, Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said
in an interview earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
