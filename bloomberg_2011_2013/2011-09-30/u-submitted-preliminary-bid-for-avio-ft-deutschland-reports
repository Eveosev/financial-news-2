MTU Aero Engines Holding AG
submitted a preliminary offer of about 3 billion euros ($4.1
billion) for Avio, an Italian aviation-engine company owned by
Cinven Group Ltd.,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  The sale was called off after offers came in below the 3.35
billion euros Cinven was seeking, the newspaper said, without
disclosing how it obtained the information.  Cinven may split off the aerospace unit and offer just the
plane engine division for sale, FTD said. Safran SA also
submitted a preliminary offer, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
