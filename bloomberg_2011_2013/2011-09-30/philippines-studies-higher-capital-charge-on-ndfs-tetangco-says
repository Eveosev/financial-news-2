The Philippine central bank will
likely ask lenders to set aside more capital to cover non-
deliverable currency forwards or NDFs and is studying the
appropriate level, Governor Amando Tetangco said today.  The regulator is getting feedback from banks on the NDF
policy, Tetangco told a media briefing. The bankâ€™s supervision
unit is soliciting comments from lenders on a plan to impose a
187.5 percent market risk weight on NDFs, according to a draft
guideline obtained by Bloomberg News earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
