Treasuries rose, extending their
biggest quarterly advance since the depths of the financial
crisis in 2008, on concern Europe’s sovereign-debt turmoil and a
sluggish  U.S. economy  will undermine the global recovery.  Thirty-year bonds led gains after the  Federal Reserve  said
it will buy about $44 billion of longer-term securities and sell
the same amount of shorter maturities over the next month under
the stimulus program known as Operation Twist. Traders cut bets
on inflation after a report showed  consumer spending  rose at a
slower pace in August.  “There is a sense in the Treasury market that lower growth
and a deflationary outcome is the base-case scenario,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at BTIG LLC in New York.
“With central banks moving toward more accommodative positions,
there is little impetus for rates to rise, maybe for years.”  Yields on 30-year bonds fell 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 2.92 percent at 5:09 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.75 percent
securities due in August 2041 increased 3, or $30 per $1,000
face amount, to 116 18/8. The yields rose about two basis points
on the week.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled 2.5 percent today.
The Stoxx 600 Europe Index slid 1.2 percent. Crude oil for
November delivery dropped 4.2 percent to $78.67 a barrel.  Ten-year yields slid eight basis points to 1.92 percent,
falling for the first time in six days. They touched 1.6714
percent on Sept. 23, the lowest in Fed figures beginning in
1953. Two-year yields slid two basis points to 0.24 percent.  Twist Announcement  Thirty-year yields tumbled 146 basis points over the past
three months, the biggest quarterly reduction since the period
ended December 2008. Two-year note yields fell 22 basis points.  Yields on 30-year bonds tumbled 41 basis points during the
week including Sept. 21, when the Fed announced it would buy
$400 billion of  U.S. debt  with maturities of six to 30 years
through June while selling an equal amount of securities due in
three years or less. The central bank said it aims to stimulate
the economy by keeping borrowing costs lower.  Purchases will begin Oct. 3 with the  acquisition  of $2.25
billion to $2.75 billion of Treasuries maturing between February
2036 and August 2041, according to a statement today from the
New York Fed.  The next two days the central bank will purchase $4.25
billion to $5 billion of notes maturing between November 2019
and August 2021 and $1 billion to $1.5 billion of inflation-
indexed debt due between January 2018 and February 2041. The Fed
is scheduled on Oct. 6 to sell $8 billion to $9 billion of
securities due between January and July 2012.  Fed Debt Buying  “The most notable part of the Fed announcement is that
they are emphasizing the purchases first as evidenced by the
long-bond purchases followed by 10-year debt purchases,” said
 Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The extra yield investors demand to hold 30-year U.S. bonds
instead of two-year notes fell today to 267 basis points. It
shrank to 260 basis points on Sept. 22, the least on a closing
basis since February 2009.  Personal spending in the U.S. advanced 0.2 percent in
August after a revised 0.7 percent increase in the previous
month, the Commerce Department reported.  “As the macro situation deteriorates in the final quarter,
the weaker growth will reinforce the financial market tensions
and underpin the bid for safety,” said  Christoph Rieger , head
of fixed-income strategy at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .  Break-Even Rate  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt known as the
break-even rate, fell for a third day to 1.78 percentage points.
The average over the past 12 months is 2.26 percentage points.  Treasuries also gained today as some investors purchased
debt to increase the duration of their portfolios to match
benchmarks at the end of the month, such as the Barclays Plc
U.S. Treasury Index. Duration measures how sensitive a bond’s
price is to changes in yield.  The Barclays index is expected to extend by 0.08 years for
the end of this month, compared with 0.13 years at the end of
August, according to the firm, a primary dealer.  Treasuries with a maturity of 10 years or longer have
returned 22 percent this quarter, the most since 1980, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The  S&P 500 Index  has
fallen 14 percent since June 30, the most since 2008.  European Rescue  Europe ’s leaders are turning their focus to the next steps
to stem the region’s debt crisis after German lawmakers approved
yesterday an expansion of the euro-area rescue fund that raises
 Germany ’s guarantees to 211 billion euros ($285 billion) from
123 billion euros. The nation won’t increase its contribution
further, the  Finance Ministry  said today.  Ten-year note yields will increase to 2.20 percent by year-
end, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of banks and securities firms, with the most recent
forecasts given the heaviest weightings. On Aug. 12, yields were
projected to finish 2011 at 2.72 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
