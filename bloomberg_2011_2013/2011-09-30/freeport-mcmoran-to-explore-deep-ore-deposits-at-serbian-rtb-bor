Freeport McMoRan Exploration Corp.
mining company will search for copper, gold and silver at depths
of more than 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) with RTB Bor in eastern
 Serbia .  Freeport will employ its block caving technology for deep
ore zones to try to find new deposits at RTB Bor’s Cerovo, Coka
Marin and Borska Reka mines and in surrounding locations, the
Serbian state-owned company said in an e-mailed statement today.  A strategic partnership between the two was discussed
during a visit to RTB Bor by Freeport officials this week, the
statement said. Pending approval by Serbian regulators, the
cooperation would focus on new reserves, while RTB Bor, the
Balkan country’s only copper miner and smelter, would continue
mining its proven deposits of some 1.5 billion tons of ore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
