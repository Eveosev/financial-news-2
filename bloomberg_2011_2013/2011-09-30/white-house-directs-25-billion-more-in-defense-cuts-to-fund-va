The White House has directed the
Pentagon to reduce its 10-year spending plan by another $25
billion, on top of the roughly $450 billion it’s already
planning to cut, according to three government officials.  The Office of Management and Budget directed the action
because the White House decided to protect Veterans
Administration medical funding from cuts, said one the
officials. All three spoke on condition of anonymity because the
change hasn’t been announced.  The reduction might mean a $1 billion cut in the pending
$513 billion defense bill for fiscal 2012, said the official,
who was familiar with the OMB action. The bill’s already been
reduced $26 billion from the Pentagon’s original budget request,
meaning about no increase from current year spending.  The OMB guidance came in early September, said one of the
three sources.  A $27 billion reduction remains within the range laid out
in the Budget Control Act signed into law Aug. 2. For the fiscal
years beginning in 2013, the new cut would average an additional
$2.5 billion a year, the official said.  The Budget Control Act has an overall cap for fiscal 2012
and 2013 that includes the Defense Department, State Department,
Veterans Administration and Department of  Homeland Security , so
to protect this veterans funding means that all other accounts
in the security budget will have to be cut that much more, said
 Todd Harrison , an analyst with the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments, a non-partisan budget analysis group in
Washington.  VA Health Costs  The President’s fiscal 2012 budget request included $52.6
billion for veteran’s health care. The VA’s discretionary budget
and veteran’s health care budget is projected to reach $60
billion by fiscal 2016, Harrison said.  The Pentagon may get hit with another $500 billion over 10
years in automatic cuts if the supercommittee in Congress fails
to find $1.5 trillion in overall federal savings, according to
the  Congressional Budget Office .  Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen told a
business group last week the cumulative cuts might be as high as
$1.1 trillion. That would represent between 15 and 18 percent of
an estimated $6.14 trillion 10-year spending projection,
according to administration figures.  War Costs  Separately, the White House in its deficit reduction
discussions has made clear that the cost of the Iraq and
 Afghanistan  wars remains a driving force in the budget.  The Pentagon’s latest figures through July 30 indicate the
military’s spent $1.054 trillion since Sept. 11, 2001, with
$704.6 billion obligated for Iraq and $323.2 billion for
Afghanistan.  The spending total includes war-related operations,
transportation, special combat pay and benefits, food, medical
services, maintenance, replacement of lost combat equipment and
building the  Iraq  and Afghanistan security forces.  The average monthly cost for both wars this fiscal year
through July 30 -- the latest figures available -- is $11.6
billion. That’s up from $9.7 billion as of April 30, according
to Pentagon Comptroller figures.  As of July 30, monthly Afghanistan spending has increased
to $7.8 billion from $6.2 billion April 30; Iraq spending has
increased slightly to $3.8 billion from $3.5 billion, according
to the figures. The U.S. has 46,000 troops in Iraq and 98,000 in
Afghanistan.  The Afghanistan increase has been driven primarily by more
expensive base and facilities support, greater command, control
and intelligence equipment, and maintenance and base support of
fortified MRAP vehicles, according to Pentagon briefing charts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
