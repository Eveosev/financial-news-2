Army General Martin Dempsey was
sworn in as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the top
military adviser to President  Barack Obama .  The U.S. is “moving forward from a position of strength,”
Obama said today at a ceremony for the new chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, at the Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in
Arlington, Virginia, outside Washington. “We will maintain our
military superiority” and continue as a “force for freedom and
security.”  Dempsey, 59, the 18th chairman, has been Army chief of
staff since April and is a veteran of the war in Iraq who helped
Iraqi troops in their security takeover. He replaces Navy
Admiral Mike Mullen, who served in the post for four years.
Mullen retires tomorrow.  Obama will be looking for advice from Dempsey and new
Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  in an era of budget cutting at
the Pentagon while avoiding any erosion in U.S. readiness.
Dempsey also takes over as the president withdraws remaining
U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of the year and soldiers from
Afghanistan by 2014.  Dempsey graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at  West
Point ,  New York , in 1974 with David Petraeus, the former top
U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan who is now director of
the Central Intelligence Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
