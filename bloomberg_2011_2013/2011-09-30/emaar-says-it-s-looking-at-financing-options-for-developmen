Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the Dubai
developer of the world’s  tallest tower , said it’s seeking
financing options and that details of reports that it plans to
raise cash backed by the emirate’s largest shopping mall were
wrong.  The company “continuously explores various options for
raising finance to meet our long-term development plans,
including refinancing of debts,” Emaar said in an e-mail late
yesterday. Emaar said it will disclose “any such details
regarding our financing plans at the appropriate time.”  Commenting on a report it aims to raise $800 million in
loans, using four shopping malls including the Dubai Mall as
collateral, Emaar said “details regarding a financing plan are
categorically incorrect and purely speculative in nature.” The
statement didn’t say which details were incorrect.  The facility, consisting of a five-year tranche and an
eight-year amortizing loan, was said to be arranged by Dubai
Islamic Bank, National Bank of  Abu Dhabi  and Standard Chartered
Plc., Reuters reported yesterday, citing unidentified people.  Emaar, the  United Arab Emirates ’ biggest developer by
market value, has been hurt by a more than 60 percent slump in
property prices in its home market as speculative demand waned
and banks tightened lending after mid-2008. The company reported
a 69 percent decline in second-quarter profit as it wrote down a
bank investment and completed fewer homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
