Volkswagen AG (VOW)  has replied to  Suzuki
Motor Corp. (7269) ’s demand that it retract an allegation that Suzuki
infringed a partnership agreement, the Japanese automaker said.  The German automaker’s response “is not worthy of
comment,” Hideki Taguchi, a spokesman for the Hamamatsu, Japan-
based Suzuki, said by telephone today. He declined to expand on
the details of VW’s reply.  Suzuki had demanded VW,  Europe ’s largest automaker, retract
by today its allegation that the Japanese company violated a
cooperation agreement by purchasing engines from Fiat SpA.
Suzuki said it never breached the VW agreement, which it is now
trying to end.  “The facts haven’t changed for Volkswagen,” said Michael Brendel, a spokesman for the German automaker in Wolfsburg,
declining to comment on the contents of its response to Suzuki.  VW’s allegation that Suzuki’s purchase of  diesel engines 
from Fiat broke their cooperation agreement “significantly
disparaged Suzuki’s honor,” Suzuki Chairman  Osamu Suzuki  said
Sept. 22.  VW owns a 19.9 percent stake in Suzuki worth 222.5 billion
yen ($2.9 billion), and their cooperation agreement hasn’t
resulted in a single project. The two have been at odds since
the Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker said in its March annual
report that it could “significantly influence financial and
operating policy decisions” at Suzuki, describing the Japanese
company as an “associate.”  The Japanese automaker, which owns 1.49 percent of VW,
plans to sell its holdings if the tie-up ends, the company said
Sept. 12. VW has said it doesn’t plan to sell or reduce its
stake in Suzuki.  To contact the reporters on this story:
