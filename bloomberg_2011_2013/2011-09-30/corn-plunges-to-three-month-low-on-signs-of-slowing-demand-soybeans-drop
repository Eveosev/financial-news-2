Corn plunged, heading for a record
monthly decline, after a government report showed larger U.S.
inventories than forecast, signaling reduced demand for the
grain used in  animal feed  and ethanol. Soybeans also declined.  Consumption of corn in the U.S., the world’s largest grower
and exporter, fell to 2.54 billion bushels in the three months
ended Aug. 31 from 2.6 billion a year earlier, the Department of
Agriculture said today in a  report . Feed use dropped 7.9 percent
to 456 million bushels. Prices are down 23 percent since the end
of August, heading for the biggest monthly decline on record.  “It’s a big negative surprise,” said Gregg Hunt, a market
analyst and broker at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
“The drop in consumption implies that livestock feeders were
using other feed sources, including ethanol by-products, and
also says that last year’s crop was larger than the USDA
estimated.”  Corn futures for December delivery plunged 36.75 cents, or
5.8 percent, to $5.9575 a bushel at 10:28 a.m. on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade, after dropping as much as the 40-cent exchange
limit to $5.925, the lowest since July 1.  Soybean futures for November delivery dropped 39.5 cents,
or 3.2 percent, to $11.905 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching
$11.7925, the lowest for a most-active contract since Nov. 17.  Corn stockpiles on Sept. 1 totaled 1.128 billion bushels,
down from 1.708 billion a year earlier, the USDA said. Analysts
in a Bloomberg News survey expected 942 million, on average.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
