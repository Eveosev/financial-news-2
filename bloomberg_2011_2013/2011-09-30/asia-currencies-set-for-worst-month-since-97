Asian currencies were set for their
biggest monthly loss in more than a decade as concern some
European nations will struggle to pay their debts and a global
slowdown bolstered demand for the relative safety of the dollar.  South Korea ’s won completed its worst month since February
2009 and Taiwan’s dollar dropped the most since October 1997 as
overseas funds pulled more than $4 billion from their stock
markets. About three-quarters of 1,031 investors, analysts and
traders said the euro-area economy will fall into recession
during the next 12 months, according to a Bloomberg quarterly
Global Poll published yesterday. The  Federal Reserve  warned of
“significant downside risks” to the  U.S. economy  on Sept. 21.  “The odds are rising for a recession in Europe and we are
seeing adjustments to market positioning on risk aversion,”
said Roy Teo, a currency strategist at ABN Amro Private Bank in
Singapore. “Asian economies and currencies will not be spared
as global growth is revised down.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index slid 3.9 percent
this month to 115.03, the biggest drop since December 1997, as
of 4:35 p.m. in  Hong Kong . The won lost 9.4 percent to 1,178.10
per dollar, Taiwan’s dollar dropped 4.9 percent to NT$30.506 and
Malaysia’s ringgit weakened 6.8 percent to 3.1888, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Thai baht depreciated 3.8
percent to 31.08, its worst performance since March 2001.  Global funds pulled $2.6 billion from Taiwanese equities
this month through yesterday and cut their holdings in South
Korea by $1.5 billion, exchange data show. In  Thailand , they
sold $612 million more equities and $61 million more government
debt than they bought.  Market Intervention  The  International Monetary Fund  lowered its forecast for
2011 global growth to 4 percent from 4.3 percent, and for 2012
to 4 percent from 4.5 percent last week, predicting a “severe”
fallout if  Europe  fails to contain its debt crisis. Central
banks in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines confirmed in
the past two weeks that they intervened to support their
currencies, while counterparts in  India , South Korea and
Thailand said they were prepared to take similar action.  “Asia’s currencies are under pressure because of fund
outflows as investors have been risk averse due mainly to the
European debt crisis,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “Sentiment may not recover
anytime soon.”  Government reports today showed industrial production rose
less than economists expected in South Korea and  Japan  and a
manufacturing gauge in  China  contracted for a third month in
September based on an index tracked by HSBC Holdings Plc.  Taiwan 
kept its benchmark  interest rate  on hold at 1.875 percent after
its quarterly review yesterday, ending a run of five increases
since mid-2010.  Production, Trade  The won dropped 0.4 percent in Seoul today, approaching a
one-year low of 1,196.13 reached Sept. 23. Factory output rose
4.8 percent in August from a year earlier, less than the 6.1
percent drop forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Data
tomorrow are expected to show exports rose in September at the
slowest pace in three months, based on a separate survey. The
Bank of Korea reported yesterday an August current-account
surplus of $401 million that was the smallest in seven months.  Europe’s debt crisis “will continue to dominate market
sentiment for at least a month,” said Kim Doo Hyun, a senior
currency dealer with Korea Exchange Bank in  Seoul . “Investors
will pay attention to trade data after the current-account
surplus narrowed in August.”  The ringgit slipped 0.3 percent today, capping its worst
month since June 2008. The rupiah gained today to trade at 8,825
per dollar, trimming losses this month to 3.4 percent. The baht
also gained 0.3 percent today, rebounding from a one-year low of
31.24 per dollar yesterday.  India’s rupee declined 6 percent to 48.96 per dollar this
month in Mumbai before the currency market closed today for a
holiday, after sliding 4.1 percent in August. The Philippine
peso weakened 3.3 percent for the month to 43.735 while China’s
yuan fell 0.1 percent to 6.3859 for its first loss since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
