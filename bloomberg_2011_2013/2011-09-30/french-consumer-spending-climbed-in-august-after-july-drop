French  consumer spending  on
manufactured goods climbed in August on expectations economic
growth may recover.  Household spending on industrial products rose 0.2 percent,
after declining 0.2 percent in July, national statistics office
Insee said today in an e-mailed statement. Economists expected a
0.1 percent gain in August, according to the median of 8
estimates gathered by Bloomberg News.  The increase comes after spending dropped the most in at
least six years in the second quarter. While economists expect
spending to pick up, household demand will probably contribute
less to French growth in the months ahead as the government
seeks to trim the  budget deficit  and joblessness persists.  “Unemployment fears remain a primary concern” and
“households are growing more pessimistic,” said Marion Laboure, an economist at  Barclays Capital  in Paris.  President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s government said this week that
spending on state services will drop next year in the face of
rising debt-service costs and pension charges. The budget also
calls for a 3 percent tax on all incomes exceeding 500,000 euros
($681,200).  To contact the reporter on this story:
