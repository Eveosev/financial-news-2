WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  said its board voted
to boost the insurer’s share repurchase plan by $5 billion.  WellPoint, the largest U.S. health insurer by enrollment,
will use the authorization over several years as market and
industry conditions dictate, the Indianapolis-based company said
today in a regulatory filing. The new amount represents 21
percent of the company’s market capitalization.  The company bought 20.8 million shares in the first six
months of this year for about $1.5 billion of a $1.6 billion
repurchase program announced in February. As of June 30, the
remaining authorization totaled $667.2 million, Kristin Binns, a
WellPoint spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Investors criticized the insurer in 2010 for using its
money to buy back stock instead of paying dividends. Along with
the share repurchase plan announced in February, WellPoint said
it would pay its first dividend of 25 cents a quarter beginning
in March.  WellPoint declined 9 cents to $65.28 at 4 p.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 15
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
