The rand declined for a second day
against the dollar, set for its worst quarter in 10 years, as
declines in German retail sales, Chinese manufacturing and U.S.
 consumer spending  signaled global growth is slowing.  The rand weakened as much as 3 percent to 8.1926 per
dollar, and traded 2 percent down at 8.1164 as of 3:20 p.m. in
Johannesburg. South Africa’s currency has depreciated 17 percent
this quarter, the most since the three months to December 2001.
It’s the worst performer in the quarter against the dollar among
16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Emerging-market stocks declined, the dollar and yen
advanced against most major counterparts and gold rose as
evidence of a global slowdown spurred investors to move money to
havens. South Africa’s benchmark stock index dropped for a third
day and bond yields rose to the highest since Sept. 26.  “The realization that global growth is slowing much
quicker than expected, combined with financial-market stress, is
adding to the  risk aversion  that is behind the rand’s
weakness,” Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, a currency strategist at
Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said by phone.  German retail sales slumped 2.9 percent in August from
July, when they rose 0.3 percent, the Federal Statistics Office
in Wiesbaden said today. That’s the biggest drop since May 2007.
Consumer spending in the U.S. gained 0.2 percent in August after
a 0.8 percent increase the previous month, while a gauge of
Chinese manufacturing shrank for a third month, the longest
contraction since 2009.  Data ‘Disappointing’  “Disappointing household spending data out of the U.S. and
 Germany , combined with dismal manufacturing data out of  China ,
has inflamed fears about a global recession,” spurring
investors to pull money out of emerging markets, Standard Bank
Group Ltd. analysts led by Johannesburg-based Michael Keenan
said in a research note.  Foreign investors were net sellers of 6.6 billion rand
($802 million) of South African bonds in the first four days of
this week, more than in any other week since Jan. 14, according
to JSE Ltd. data.  The rand stayed weaker after  South Africa ’s trade gap
narrowed from a six-month high in August, and the Treasury
reported that the  budget deficit  for the first five months of
the fiscal year widened to 86.8 billion rand, from 78.2 billion
rand in the same period a year ago.  Bonds fell for a second day on speculation the weaker rand
will fuel inflation, crimping the central bank’s room to cut
 interest rates  as the economy falters.  The 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 dropped 36 cents to 122.09
rand, driving the yield up nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 6.99 percent. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021
fell 62 cents to 89.85 rand, boosting the yield 10 basis points
to 8.32 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
