Russian billionaire  Vladimir
Lisin ’s UCL Holding company is interested in bidding for 50
percent of the London-listed OAO Transcontainer rail cargo
operator, three people familiar with the plans said.  Businessman Ziyavudin Magomedov’s Summa group, Sergey
Generalov’s Fesco Transportation Group and N-Trans Group, which
includes Globaltrans Investment Plc,  Russia ’s biggest non-state
rail operator, may also compete for control of the company, said
the people, including an OAO Russian Railways official, who
declined to be identified before the auction is announced.  Russian Railways, which is selling stakes in some of its
largest subsidiaries this year, may offer investors its entire
50 percent of the Moscow-based cargo unit, Deputy Economy
Minister Stanislav Voskresenky said yesterday. Russian Rail aims
to raise funds for its three-year 1 trillion ruble ($31 billion)
investment program.  Summa Vice President Konstantin Panin said the group is
interested in a controlling stake in TransContainer, as did
Fesco Vice President Stanislav Vartanyan. Fesco bought a 12
percent stake during the cargo carrier’s initial public offering
last year. UCL and N-Trans representatives declined to
immediately comment.   To contact the reporter on this story:
