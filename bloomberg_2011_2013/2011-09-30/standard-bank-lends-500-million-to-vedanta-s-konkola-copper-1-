Standard Bank  Group Ltd. provided a
$500 million bridge loan to Konkola Copper Mines Plc, a Zambian
unit of  Vedanta Resources Plc. (VED)   The Johannesburg-based lender will arrange and underwrite a
further $700 million  term loan  to fund investment, it said today
in a statement. Konkola will use $500 million to refinance
shareholder loans from Vedanta and $700 million to fund
investments, according to the statement.  Konkola, the largest mining and metals company in Zambia,
is seeking to double annual output to 400,000 tons and invest $1
billion by 2014. Vedanta, which received conditional approval
from  India ’s government to take over Cairn India Ltd., operator
of the country’s biggest onshore oilfield, is seeking to raise
about $6 billion to fund the transaction.  “Standard Bank has full confidence in KCM management’s
ability to drive the company’s growth towards becoming one of
the world’s leading copper producers,” the bank said. “We are
proud to be KCM’s, and its parent Vedanta’s, financial partner
in this process.”  Vedanta is seeking $3.5 billion of bank loans, $1.5 billion
in a bond sale and $1 billion from equities, Chief Financial
Officer Din Dayal Jalan said on May 5. The equity funding will
be raised “by primary and secondary offerings” by Konkola and
Vedanta, he said.  Vedanta, which postponed an initial public offering of
Konkola Copper Mines in November, may go ahead with the plan by
the end of this year, Chairman  Anil Agarwal  said on May 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
