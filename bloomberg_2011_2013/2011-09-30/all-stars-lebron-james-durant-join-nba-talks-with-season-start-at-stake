All-Stars LeBron James,  Kevin Durant ,  Dwyane Wade  and  Carmelo Anthony  were among National
Basketball Association players who arrived at a Manhattan hotel
for labor negotiations that could determine whether the season
starts on time.  The full negotiating teams of the league and the  National
Basketball Players Association  are meeting today for talks that
league Commissioner  David Stern  said two days ago would have
“enormous consequences” on the NBA season, which is scheduled
to start Nov. 1.  Union President Derek Fisher said Sept. 28 that several
“key players” also would be present for today’s session, which
comes on the 92nd day of a lockout and could lead into more
negotiations this weekend as time dwindles before postponing the
season becomes inevitable.  The NBA, which locked out the players when their collective
bargaining agreement expired on July 1, already has postponed
training camp indefinitely and canceled the first 43 preseason
exhibition games through Oct. 15.  The two sides are negotiating over how to split revenue
from a league that had about $4.3 billion last season. Stern has
said that the league has lost at least $300 million in each of
the past three seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
