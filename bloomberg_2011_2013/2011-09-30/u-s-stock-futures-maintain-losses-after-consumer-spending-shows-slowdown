U.S. stock futures maintained
losses after U.S. consumer spending slowed in August as incomes
unexpectedly dropped for the first time in almost two years.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring in December
retreated 0.9 percent to 1,145.4 at 8:33 a.m. New York time.  Purchases rose 0.2 percent after a 0.7 percent increase the
prior month, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . A 0.2 percent advance in prices wiped out the gain
in so-called nominal, or unadjusted, spending. Incomes decreased
0.1 percent, the first decline since October 2009.  The S&P 500 yesterday rose 0.8 percent as lower-than-
estimated claims for  unemployment benefits  helped offset losses
in consumer and technology shares. The index is heading toward
its fifth monthly loss, the longest falling streak since March
2008. The U.S. equity gauge has tumbled 12 percent this quarter
and is down 7.7 percent for the year.  Global stocks fell earlier today after reports from China
and Germany added to concern the global economy is slowing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
