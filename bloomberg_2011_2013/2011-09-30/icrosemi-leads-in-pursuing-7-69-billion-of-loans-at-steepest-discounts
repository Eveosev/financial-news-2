Microsemi Corp. (MSCC)  is leading U.S.
companies this week in seeking $7.69 billion in leveraged loans
as investors seek the steepest discounts to buy the debt since
the third quarter of 2009.  Microsemi, a maker of microchips for the aerospace and
defense industries, is proposing to sell an $800 million term
piece to back an acquisition at 97 cents to 98 cents on the
dollar, reducing proceeds for the company and increasing the
yield for investors.  DigitalGlobe Inc. (DGI)  is willing to sell a $500
million financing at a price as low as 97.5 cents.  Junk-rated borrowers are finding it more expensive to
borrow in the loan market after prices of the debt are poised to
drop for two consecutive months. New issue loan volume for the
month through Sept. 28 is $15.1 billion, less than half of the
$30.5 billion borrowed during the same period in 2010, according
to Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary & Data.  “Since early August, the market’s been focused on
committed supply versus where the demand’s coming from on the
loan side,” Timothy Broadbent, head of leveraged-loan syndicate
for the Americas at  Barclays Capital , the investment banking
unit of Barclays Plc, said in a telephone interview. “There’s
enough cash to take down the committed supply, it’s just a
question of price and whether it will all clear.”  The average original-issue discount needed to sell the
loans is at 96.9 cents on the dollar as of yesterday, down from
98.7 cents last September, and the most since the third quarter
of 2009’s 96.7 cents, according to S&P LCD.  Go Daddy Loan  Go Daddy Group Inc. this week sold a $750 million term loan
to support its leveraged buyout by KKR & CO.,  Silver Lake
Partners  and Technology Crossover Ventures after it increased
the original-issue discount to 93 cents on the dollar from 96
cents initially proposed.  Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Canada, KKR
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. arranged the Scottsdale, Arizona-
based company’s loan with an interest rate of 5.75 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate and a 1.25
percent floor on the lending benchmark, Bloomberg data show.  “Everybody would much rather move risk, even if that means
losing a little money,” Broadbent said. “This is nowhere near
as painful as the crisis days.” The average institutional
original-issue discount during the fourth quarter of 2008 was
94.9 cents, according to S&P’s LCD.  Education-software maker  Blackboard Inc. (BBBB)  sold a $780
million first-lien portion of a financing backing its buyout by
Providence Equity Partners Inc. at 92 cents on the dollar,
compared with 96.5 cents to 97 cents initially proposed. The
debt pays six percentage points more than Libor with a 1.5
percent floor, Bloomberg data show. The Washington-based company
still hasn’t sold an accompanying $350 million second-lien
slice.  ‘Flavor of the Month’  “The flavor of the month is keeping the spread but
lowering the OID,” Chief Executive Officer Leonard Tannenbaum
of Fifth Street Finance Corp., which has $1.1 billion of assets,
said in a telephone interview. “The good thing about bringing
the OID down is you don’t get refinanced. If you’re buying at
92, you’re not going to get refinanced at 103 or 102 in a
year.”  Investors pulled $117 million from funds that buy floating-
rate bank debt for the week ended Sept. 21, down from outflows
of $324 million the week ended Sept. 14, according to data from
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global. Since August,
floating-rate funds recorded $5.45 billion of outflows.  Loan Prices  The S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index fell for the
fifth time in six days, decreasing 0.10 cent to 89.07 cents on
the dollar yesterday. The measure, which tracks the 100 largest
dollar-denominated first-lien leveraged loans, has declined from
89.84 on Sept. 21, which was the highest since Aug. 8. The index
decreased to 87.47 cents on Aug. 26, the lowest level since
December 2009.  Microsemi, based in  Irvine ,  California , is proposing to pay
interest on an $800 million  term loan  of 4.25 percentage points
to 4.5 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate and the lending benchmark will have a 1.25 percent floor,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsemi may sell the
debt due February 2018 at 97 cents to 98 cents on the dollar.  DigitalGlobe set interest at 4.25 percentage points to 4.5
percentage points more than Libor on its $500 million term loan.
The debt has a 1.25 percent floor on the lending benchmark.
Longmont, Colorado-based DigitalGlobe is proposing to sell the
debt at 97.5 cents to 98 cents on the dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
are arranging the transaction.  Flexera Deal  Business software management company Flexera Software Inc.
is seeking $330 million in loans to finance its acquisition by
 Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan . The company may sell a $230
million first-lien piece at 96 cents to 97 cents on the dollar,
compared with 98 cents initially proposed, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Flexera may pay six percentage points to
6.25 percentage points more than Libor with a 1.25 percent
floor.  Schaumburg, Illinois-based Flexera may sell a $100 million
second-lien portion at 92 cents to 93 cents on the dollar,
compared with 98 cents initially offered. The debt may pay 9.75
percentage points to 10 percentage points more than Libor, with
a 1.25 percent minimum.  “There are a lot of middle market, smaller deals and
they’re getting priced pretty tight relative to the bigger
deals,” said Tannenbaum, who’s Fifth Street has about $400
million to deploy. “We see a very full pipeline going to the
end of the year. It’s going to be a really nice time for those
with capital to put it to work.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
