A supertanker was hired at the
cheapest price this year for a shipment to  South Korea ,
according to  Braemar Shipping Services Plc (BMS) , a unit of the U.K.’s
second-largest publicly traded shipbroker.  The very large crude carrier, or VLCC, shipping a 265,000
metric ton cargo, was hired at 40.5 industry-standard Worldscale
points, the lowest fixture rate so far this year for a
supertanker on the Persian Gulf-Korea route, Braemar wrote in an
e-mailed report today.  VLCCs shipping 270,000 ton crude oil cargoes to South Korea
from the  Persian Gulf  are losing $3,000 a day, compared with
daily earnings of $1,000 last week, Braemar wrote. Its
calculations assume a round-trip, sailing at 14.5 knots with a
cargo and 16 knots without. Reducing speeds can improve owners’
returns.  VLCCs on the benchmark Middle East-to-Asia route are losing
$6,492 a day from a loss of $5,845 yesterday, according to data
from the  Baltic Exchange  in London. The bourse doesn’t take
speed reduction into account when calculating losses.  There are “multiple offers for a number of cargoes,”
London-based EA Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd. said in an e-mailed
report today. Returns from VLCCs on the benchmark route first
turned negative Aug. 1, as a glut of available ships overwhelmed
demand. Global demand for supertankers will expand 4.9 percent
this year to 144.6 million deadweight tons, according to
Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit of Clarkson Plc, the
world’s largest shipbroker. The fleet will swell by 8 percent to
173.1 million tons, it estimates.  Ship Fuel  The price of ship fuel, or bunkers, advanced 25 percent
from the start of the year to $638.01 a metric ton, data
compiled by Bloomberg from 25 ports worldwide showed.  Charter rates for VLCCs declined 0.5 percent to 41.44
Worldscale points, according to the exchange. The points are a
percentage of a nominal rate, or flat rate, for more than
320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for every voyage, quoted in
U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually by the Worldscale
Association in  London  to reflect changing fuel costs, port
tariffs and exchange rates.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, an overall measure of
shipping crude oil that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs,
gained 0.3 percent to 697 points, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
