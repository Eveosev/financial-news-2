OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-
biggest natural-gas producer, raised its stake in the Yamal LNG
project to 100 percent, as it prepares to invite foreign
companies into the Arctic venture.  Novatek exercised options it bought earlier this year and
will make the remaining payments for the 23.9 percent and 25.1
percent stakes by June 30, 2012, the company said today in a
statement, without elaborating.  The gas producer plans to offer shares to future partners
in the project to produce liquefied natural gas, while retaining
the 51 percent it had previously. Yamal LNG may need as much as
$20 billion in investments, not including spending on a tanker
fleet to ship the fuel from the icebound waters. The project may
be the world’s most complex undertaking of its kind, Evgeny Ambrosov, senior executive vice president of state shipper OAO
Sovcomflot, said this week.  The Tarko-Sale, Siberia based producer agreed to buy its 51
percent stake for $650 million in 2009. In July 2009, it paid
$10 million for an option to buy the 23.9 percent stake for $450
million. This year in March, it paid $15 million for a  call
option  to buy the 25.1 percent stake for $526 million.  Total SA (FP)  in March agreed to purchase a 20 percent stake in
the Arctic project to produce LNG, in a deal that hasn’t yet
closed. The French producer agreed at the same time to buy 12
percent of Novatek for about $4 billion and completed the deal
in April.  After making Total a strategic partner, Novatek is seeking
to invite more companies, holding talks with a range of
producers, including from Qatar and  India , CEO Leonid Mikhelson
said in June.  Total expects Qatar to be a good partner for Yamal LNG, as
it could provide swaps while the Russian project is shut in ice,
Christophe de Margerie, CEO of the Paris-based producer, said on
Sept. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
