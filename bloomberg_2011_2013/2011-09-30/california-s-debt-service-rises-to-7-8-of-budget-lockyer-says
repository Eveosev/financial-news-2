The percentage of  California ’s
budget spent paying bondholders will climb to its  highest  since
at least 1977 even as the state borrows less, Treasurer Bill Lockyer said.  Debt service will increase to 7.8 percent of the general
fund in the fiscal year that began July 1 from 7.1 percent last
year, Lockyer said in his annual  debt-affordability report 
released today. The portion was 2.36 percent in 1991 and 1.47
percent in 1977. California is the largest issuer of municipal
debt in the U.S.  Lockyer and Governor  Jerry Brown  imposed a moratorium on
selling bonds through the first eight months of this calendar
year as they sought to erase a $26 billion deficit. The reason
for the increase in the debt-service percentage is because, even
though debt issues flattened,  tax revenue  declined by almost 7
percent, Lockyer said.  “The next 10 years will require sustained fiscal
discipline and hard work,” Lockyer said in a statement. “With
limited general-fund resources, we have to both heavily invest
in infrastructure and adequately fund critical public services.
Reducing the general fund’s infrastructure-financing burden
should be in the mix of options for striking the right
balance.”  The state will pay $6.9 billion in debt service from
$88.5 billion in general fund revenue this year, compared with
$6.8 billion of debt service from $94.8 billion in revenue last
year, according to the report.  Lockyer sold $2.4 billion of general-obligation bonds Sept.
20 and plans to sell about $15 billion in total through June
2013. He sold $27 billion of long- and short-term bonds in
calendar year 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
