Warren Buffett , the billionaire who
runs  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , told Fox Business Network that
it’s not realistic to ask ultra-wealthy taxpayers to voluntarily
increase their payments to the government.  “If you have a country with a deficit of more than a
trillion dollars, and you think it can be solved with voluntary
tax payments, then you believe in the tooth fairy,” Buffett
told the broadcaster today in an interview in  New York .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
