The Philippine central bank will
consider the impact of recent and expected tropical storms to
farm output, domestic supply and inflation in the next monetary
policy meeting, Governor Amando Tetangco said in a media
briefing in  Manila .  “My assessment is that inflation for 2011 will still be
within target,” he said. The next policy meeting will be on
Oct. 20. Typhoon Nalgae is expected to make landfall in the
 Philippines  tomorrow, the government said today. Typhoon Nesat
killed at least 43 in the country and damaged at least 4 billion
pesos worth of farm output and infrastructure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
