The cost to protect  Eastman Kodak
Co. (EK) ’s debt from default jumped as the unprofitable 131-year-old
camera maker is said to be weighing options including a
bankruptcy filing.  Credit-default swaps linked to the Rochester,  New York- 
based company rose 4 percentage points to 66.5 percent upfront,
according to data provider CMA. That means investors would pay
$6.65 million initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10
million of Kodak’s debt for five years.  Kodak may seek bankruptcy protection because of concerns
raised by possible bidders for its patent portfolio, said three
people with direct knowledge of the process. Some potential
buyers of the patents are reluctant to proceed with bids because
a purchase may amount to a so-called fraudulent transfer if
Kodak becomes insolvent, said the people, who asked not to be
named because the talks are private.  “As we sit here today, the company has no intention of
filing, and there is no change in our strategy to monetize our
intellectual property,” saidGerard Meuchner, a spokesman for
Kodak. “We’re not concerned about fraudulent conveyance in
regards to the sale of our IP portfolio.”  Banks,  hedge funds  and other money managers had bought and
sold credit swaps that protect against a default on a net $856.9
million of Kodak obligations as of Sept. 23, according to the
 Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. , which runs a central
repository for the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
