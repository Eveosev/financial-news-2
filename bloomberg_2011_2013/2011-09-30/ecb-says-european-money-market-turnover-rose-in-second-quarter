Money-market turnover in the euro
region rose in the second quarter from a year earlier, ending
three years of decline, the  European Central Bank  said.  Aggregate turnover increased an annual 15 percent in the
three months through June, the Frankfurt-based ECB said today,
citing the results of its 2011 Money Market Survey. In the
unsecured market, cash borrowing of the 105 banks on the survey
panel increased 26 percent, while their lending contracted 5
percent, the Frankfurt-based central bank said. Overall activity
was concentrated in maturities of one month or less.  The ECB said the secured market, where aggregate turnover
increased 10 percent, remained the largest segment. All
derivative segments covered by the survey showed increases, with
turnover in cross-currency swaps jumping 68 percent.  The ECB surveys at least 105 banks for its annual report on
money markets and always compares second-quarter data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
