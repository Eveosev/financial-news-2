The average monthly U.S. cost of
the wars in  Afghanistan  and  Iraq  this fiscal year, as of July
30, is $11.6 billion, according to the Pentagon Comptroller’s
office.  That’s up from an average of $9.7 billion a month as of
April 30.  The spending total includes war-related operations,
transportation, special combat pay and benefits, food, medical
services, maintenance, replacement of lost combat equipment and
building the Iraq and Afghanistan security forces.  As of July 30, the latest figures available, monthly
Afghanistan spending has increased to $7.8 billion from $6.2
billion as of April 30; Iraq spending has increased slightly to
$3.8 billion from $3.5 billion, according to the figures.  The U.S. has about 46,000 troops in Iraq and 98,000 in
Afghanistan.  The Afghanistan increase has been driven primarily by more
expensive base and facilities support, greater command, control
and intelligence equipment, and maintenance and base support of
fortified MRAP vehicles, according to Pentagon briefing charts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
