Mauritius’s stock index rallied to
a two-week high, paring its first quarterly decline in six as
companies reported an improvement in full-year profit.  The SEMDEX gauge of the 38-member official market of the
Stock Exchange of Mauritius increased 0.9 percent to 1,900.93 by
the 1:30 p.m. close, in Port Louis, the capital, paring its
quarterly loss to 9.4 percent, snapping a five-quarter rally.  State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the Indian Ocean island
nation’s second-biggest lender, led the gains, rising 2.4
percent to 87 rupees, after saying net income climbed 8.3
percent in the year through June.  “It’s the earnings effect, excluding stocks in the
manufacturing segment,” Bhavik Desai, a senior analyst at Port
Louis-based AXYS Stockbroking Ltd., said by phone today.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the country’s largest leisure
operator by turnover, rallied 2.5 percent to 82 rupees after
saying it will pay final dividend of 0.5 rupee for the year
through September.  Naiade Resorts Ltd (NRL) , the third-biggest hotel operator,
rallied 0.7 percent to 27.30 rupees, after returning to profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
