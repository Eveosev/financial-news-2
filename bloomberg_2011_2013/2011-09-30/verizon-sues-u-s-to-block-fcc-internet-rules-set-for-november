Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  sued to
overturn the Federal Communication Commission’s open-Internet
rules set to take effect Nov. 20, saying the agency lacks
authority to regulate how companies provide Internet service.  The so-called net-neutrality rules, adopted in December,
would prevent Internet service providers from blocking or
slowing the flow of Web content to homes and businesses. It’s
the second time New York-based Verizon asked the U.S. Court of
Appeals in  Washington  to overturn the rules. The court dismissed
the first suit April 4, ruling the challenge was premature.  “We are deeply concerned by the FCC’s assertion of broad
authority to impose potentially sweeping and unneeded
regulations on broadband networks and services and on the
Internet itself,” Michael E. Glover, senior vice president and
deputy general counsel, said in a statement.  The scope of the rules doesn’t follow the law and will
“create uncertainty for the communications industry, innovators,
investors and consumers,” Glover said.  Neil Derek Grace, a spokesman for the FCC, said by e-mail
that the agency will oppose any effort to disrupt the
“certainty” created by the rule which, he said, “ensures that
the Internet remains an engine for job creation, innovation and
economic growth.”  The case is Verizon v. Federal Communications Commission,
11-1356,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the  District of Columbia 
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
