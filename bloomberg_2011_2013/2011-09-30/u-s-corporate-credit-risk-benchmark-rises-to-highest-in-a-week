A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk rose to the highest level this week, as declines in
German retail sales and Chinese manufacturing signaled global
growth is slowing, exacerbating concerns that company
creditworthiness may deteriorate.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 1.8 basis points to a mid-
price of 141.5 basis points as of 12:17 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, is headed for a weekly
increase of 0.8 basis point.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
