The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission told Dominion Resources Inc. that it won’t let the
North Anna reactors restart after last month’s earthquake until
the agency is confident operations would be safe.  The commission said in a statement today that it planned
additional inspections at the nuclear power plant near Louisa,
Virginia. The reactors haven’t generated electricity since a
5.8-magnitude temblor on Aug. 23, the state’s worst in more than
a century.  “We’re reviewing Dominion’s information to ensure North
Anna’s systems will be able to keep the public safe and the
plant won’t start up again until we’re satisfied on that
point,” Eric Leeds, director of the NRC’s Office of Nuclear
Reactor Regulation, said in a statement.  Regulators are using the 33-year-old nuclear plant as a
model to re-evaluate earthquake risks. Dominion filed on Sept.
17 for permission to start the North Anna reactors as soon as
the company completes a list of tests and examinations.  The NRC will release the preliminary results of its review
on Oct. 3 at a public meeting at the North Anna plant, about 40
miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Dominion’s headquarters in
Richmond.  “In multiple, detailed inspections, we have found no
significant damage at North Anna caused by the quake,” Jim Norvelle, a spokesman for Dominion, said in an e-mail today.
“We will continue to work with the NRC as it performs its
necessary inspections.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
