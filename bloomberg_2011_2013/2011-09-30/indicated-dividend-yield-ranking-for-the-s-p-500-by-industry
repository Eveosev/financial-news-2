The table below ranks indicated dividend yields
of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index by industry as of
today. The yield is calculated by taking the latest declared dividend,
annualized and divided by the stock price. Payout ratios are calculated based
on latest quarterly dividend paid divided by earnings. The data is first
sorted by the industry name alphabetically and then by the yield in descending
order. Dividends are paid on a quarterly basis unless noted.
