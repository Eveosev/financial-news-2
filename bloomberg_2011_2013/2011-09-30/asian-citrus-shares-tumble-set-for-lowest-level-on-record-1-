Asian Citrus Holdings Ltd. (ACHL) , an owner
and operator of orange plantations in China, fell to the lowest
level on record in Hong Kong trading. The company has ties to
companies owned by a man accused of insider trading.  Asian Citrus, which reported a 90 percent surge in its
full-year profit on Sept. 16, tumbled 28 percent to HK$3.62 in
Hong Kong yesterday, its lowest closing price since its debut in
November 2009. That compares with the 2.3 percent drop by the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   The company is 13 percent owned by  Chaoda Modern
Agriculture Holdings Ltd. (682)  and buys organic fertilizer from
Fujian Chaoda Group, 95 percent owned by Chaoda Modern Chairman
Kwok Ho, according to a  Hong Kong  stock exchange filing
yesterday. Kwok, Chaoda Chief Financial Officer Andy Chan, and
Fidelity Management’s George Stairs were accused by Hong Kong’s
financial secretary of insider trading, according to a notice
released by the tribunal on Sept. 28  Asian Citrus said it didn’t know any other reason for the
decline in its share price.  Kwok, who founded Chaoda, has a 19.6 percent stake in that
company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Kwok is
disputing the allegations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
