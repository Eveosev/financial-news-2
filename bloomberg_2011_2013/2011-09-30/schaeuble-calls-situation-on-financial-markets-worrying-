Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
called the turmoil on financial markets “worrying” and cited
concern that debt crisis could impact the European financial
sector.   “The situation on the international financial markets is
worrying,” Schaeuble told members of  Germany ’s upper house of
parliament, or Bundesrat, in Berlin today. He said it’s
“urgent” that the Bundesrat approve legislation to enhance the
European Financial Stability Facility today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
