Colombia’s peso fell to its lowest
level this year as declines in Chinese manufacturing and German
retail sales signaled global growth is slowing.  The peso fell 0.7 percent to 1,931.98 per  U.S. dollar  at
3:31 p.m. New York time, from 1,917.65 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,936.88, its lowest level since Dec. 30. The peso
plunged 7.5 percent in the past month and 8.3 percent this
quarter.  “The local market is completely focused on what is
happening abroad,” said  Andres Pardo , the head analyst at
financial services holding company Corp. Financiera Colombiana,
known as Corficolombiana. “There’s a lot of volatility as
investors look at the economic data and try and look for signals
on future growth. People are nervous.”  Chinese manufacturing shrank for a third month, the longest
contraction since 2009. German sales slumped 2.9 percent in
August, the most in more than four years and more than the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey for a 0.5 percent decline.  The yield on  Colombia ’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
7.59 percent. The bond’s price fell 0.550 centavo to 119.261
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
