Arsenal Holdings Plc’s fiscal-year
profit fell 79 percent as the  soccer club  sold fewer apartments
at its former stadium and paid more to its players.  Net income fell to 13 million pounds ($20 million) for the
12 months ended May 31, from 61 million pounds in the year-
earlier period, the north  London  team said today in a statement.
Revenue declined by a third to 255.7 million pounds. The Gunners
debt was reduced by 28 percent to 97.8 million pounds.  “Our primary objective, as we take the club forward, will
always be success on the field,” Chief Executive Officer Ivan Gazidis said in the statement. “To give the club the best
opportunity to achieve this, we must drive a virtuous circle of
increased revenue, increased investment in the team and a larger
engaged fan base and we must do this in a way which is self-
sustaining and protects the long-term future of the club.”  While property sales dropped to 30.3 million pounds from
157 million pounds last year, revenue from soccer operations
rose almost 2 percent to 225.4 million pounds. Staff wages rose
12 percent to 124.4 million pounds, or about 55.2 percent of
soccer revenue.  Arsenal, which has won  England ’s top league 13 times,
played at Highbury from 1913 to 2006 before moving to the
60,000-seat Emirates Stadium nearby. The new facility, which
helped almost double matchday sales, drew an average of 59,849
fans per home game last season.  The club, which is celebrating its 125th anniversary
season, hasn’t won a trophy since capturing the 2005 F.A. Cup.
Last season it lost to Birmingham in the final of the League
Cup, was beaten by Barcelona in the Champions League round of
16, lost to  Manchester United  in the F.A. Cup quarterfinals and
finished fourth in the Premier League.  Arsenal has struggled early this season and is 13th in the
20-team league with seven points from six matches. The club is
regrouping after selling captain Cesc Fabregas,  Samir Nasri ,
Emmanuel Eboue and Gael Clichy over the summer, while bringing
in  Mikel Arteta , Per Mertesacker,  Yossi Benayoun , Andre Santos
and Gervinho.  “There is no doubt that we have had a tough start to the
2011-12 campaign but we have won through an awkward Champions
League qualifier and we remain confident in the quality within
the squad and or our prospects for the rest of the season,”
Gazidis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
