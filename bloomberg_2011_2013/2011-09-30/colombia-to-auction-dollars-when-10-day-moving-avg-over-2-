Colombia ’s central bank said that
it will begin buying and selling dollars in auctions to curb the
peso’s volatility.  The bank will auction $200 million in the spot market when
the peso’s 10-day moving average changes by more than 2 percent,
the bank said in a statement today.  The bank said the measure was a response to “extreme
volatility” in financial markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
