Turkish central bank governor Erdem Basci said direct interventions in the currency market increase
volatility.  Recent action in  Brazil ,  South Korea  and Poland prove that
fact, Basci said in response to questions from businessmen and
reporters in the northwestern city of Edirne today.  The central bankâ€™s daily sales of dollars for liras are
designed to minimize volatility, Basci said. The lira is likely
to gain over the next year or two, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
