The Hungarian Banking Association
has not yet reached a decision whether to turn to the European
Union or the Europan Court of Justice over a government plan on
the repayment of foreign-currency mortgages at below-market
rates, Mihaly Patai, head of the lobby group said.  “Some individual banks are considering turning to the EU,
the association has yet to reach a decision on this,” Patai
said at a conference in Budapest today. The group will attack
the plan at the Hungarian Constitutional Court, Patai, who is
also the chief executive officer of UniCredit Hungary, said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
