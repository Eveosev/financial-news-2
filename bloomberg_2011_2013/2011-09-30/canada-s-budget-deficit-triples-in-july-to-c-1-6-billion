Canada ’s federal budget deficit
more than tripled in July from a year earlier, on falling
revenue from corporate and sales taxes, according to a statement
released today by Canada’s finance department.  The federal deficit widened during the month to C$1.6
billion ($1.54 billion), from C$473 million a year earlier.
Revenue from corporate income taxes fell 13 percent to C$2.2
billion, while income from the federal  sales tax  was down 13
percent to C$2.63 billion. The deficit for the first four months
of the fiscal year that began April 1 narrowed to C$7.1 billion
from C$7.7 billion as income tax revenue increased 6.6 percent.  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  has said the
government’s fiscal projections for the current year remain
consistent with forecasts even amid indications the economy has
slowed. The government has benefited from higher  tax revenue 
from personal income taxes and a job market that is driving up
employment insurance premiums and reducing benefits.  The finance department didn’t say why corporate income
taxes fell in July.  Flaherty released a fiscal plan in June that seeks to
balance the budget by 2014 through government operating cost
cuts of up to C$4 billion annually, and by closing tax
loopholes.  Canada projects a deficit of C$32.3 billion this year, from
C$36.2 billion for the fiscal year that ended in March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
