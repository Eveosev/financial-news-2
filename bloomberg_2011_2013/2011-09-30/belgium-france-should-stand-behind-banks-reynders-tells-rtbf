Belgium and France should stand
behind their banks, notably  Dexia SA (DEXB) , and be ready to
“intervene” should there be a problem, Belgian Finance
Minister  Didier Reynders  said in an interview on RTBF radio.  The Belgian and French governments “are not discussing a
split” of Dexia, Reynders said. “We are watching the situation
of banks and are especially looking at the best way to help
them,” Reynders said. This is the best way to protect
savers and the economy, he said.  Reynders stressed that the priority is to solve the
sovereign debt crisis, notably in Greece, to avoid the risk of
contagion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
