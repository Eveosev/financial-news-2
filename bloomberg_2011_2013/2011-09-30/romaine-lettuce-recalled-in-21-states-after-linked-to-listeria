A California farm recalled almost
2,500 cartons of bagged romaine lettuce after a sample tested
positive for listeria, a potentially deadly bacterium.  No illnesses have been linked to the recalled lettuce,
producer True Leaf Farms, owned by closely held  Church Brothers
LLC  in Salinas, California, said in a  statement  posted today on
the  Food and Drug Administration ’s website. The product was
shipped Sept. 12 and Sept. 13 to food distributors in 21 states
and its “use by” date is Sept. 29, Church Brothers said
yesterday in a separate  statement .  Listeria is the same type of germ found in an unrelated
case of tainted cantaloupes from  Colorado  that sickened 84
people and killed at least 15 since July 31 in the deadliest
U.S. foodborne illness outbreak in more than a decade. Pregnant
women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are
among those at greatest risk from listeria infections. Symptoms
include fever and diarrhea.  The only outlet where the romaine was available for direct
consumer purchase was at Unified Grocers Inc., Cash & Carry
Smart Food Service stores in Oregon, Washington and Idaho,
Church Brothers said. The lettuce also was shipped to wholesale
distributors in 19 other states and  Alberta ,  Canada , according
to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
