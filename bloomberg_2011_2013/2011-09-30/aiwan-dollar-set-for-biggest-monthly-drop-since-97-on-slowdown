Taiwan ’s dollar had its biggest
monthly drop since October 1997 as a slowing global economy
prompted investors to favor safer bets than emerging-market
assets. Government bonds advanced.  The island’s central bank left the discount rate on 10-day
loans to banks unchanged at 1.875 percent yesterday as a
stagnant  U.S. economy  and  Europe ’s debt crisis dimmed the
outlook for Taiwan’s exports, which account for more than two-
thirds of its economy. Overseas investors sold $2.6 billion more
of the island’s equities than they bought this month, according
to exchange data.  “The worst time is still not over, the concern over a
global recession is looming,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based
foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank.  Taiwan’s dollar retreated 5.1 percent in September to
NT$30.506 against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local
close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It dropped 0.2 percent
today and 5.9 percent this quarter. Lin said the currency could
weaken to NT$31 by year-end.  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due September 2021 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, today to 1.273
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The
benchmark rate dropped 16 basis points this month and 23 basis
points this quarter.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.396 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
