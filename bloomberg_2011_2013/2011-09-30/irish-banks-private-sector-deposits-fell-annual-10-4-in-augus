Irish resident private-sector
deposits fell at an annual rate of 10.4 percent in August,
according to the country’s central bank. That matched the rate
recorded in July, as reported by the bank on Aug. 31.  Irish private sector deposits declined an underlying 895
million euros during August, the Dublin-based bank said in an e-
mailed statement today. Separately, private-sector deposits from
other euro-area residents rose by an underlying 217 million
euros in August, while those from non-euro area residents
increased by 179 million euros, it said.  Irish consumer lenders’ reliance on European Central Bank
funding rose by 90 million euros to 70.5 billion euros during
the month, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
