Corporate credit markets are
heading for their worst quarter in  Europe  since the collapse of
 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  in 2008 as the prospect of a Greek
default triggering an economic slump weighs on investors.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings
climbed more than 400 basis points since July 1, the biggest
rise since the fourth-quarter of 2008 when it surged 456 basis
points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Relative yields
on investment-grade company bonds have increased the most on
record, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  “The stats speak for themselves,” said  Jim Reid , head of
fundamental strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in  London . “You’ve got
a situation where if the European authorities drop the ball it
could be worse than 2008.”  Officials are racing to avert the euro-area’s first
sovereign default as European lawmakers approve expanded powers
for the region’s 440 billion-euro ($593 billion) rescue fund.
Investors are concerned  Greece ’s debt turmoil may infect other
countries and impede the global economic recovery.  Yield spreads on investment-grade bonds have surged 140
basis points since the start of the quarter to 309 yesterday,
the EMU Corporate index of 1,763 securities shows.  Markit’s Crossover gauge was today up 33.5 basis points to
831.5 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 12:30
p.m. in London.  ITraxx Europe  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was up 7.75 at 198.75 basis points. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers rose 10 basis points to 271 basis points and the
subordinated index was up 19 at 517.  Investor confidence in the region’s economy was dented
after  Germany  said that retail sales fell the most in more than
four years and the European Union reported the inflation rate in
the euro region jumped to 3 percent this month from 2.5 percent
in August, accelerating by the fastest in almost three years.  Faster inflation increases pressure on an economy already
hurt by tougher austerity measures and waning investor
confidence as governments struggle to contain the fiscal crisis.
The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased 4 basis points to 337. with Italy up 11
basis points to 467, according to CMA.  Swaps on Ireland dropped 41.5 basis points to 674.5, the
lowest since June, after Anglo Irish Bank Corp. paid a
coupon due today on junior debt, which is a “clear indication”
that the government intends to pay back a senior bank bond due
in November, according to Colm Ryan, head of fixed income at
Goodbody Stockbrokers.  One of the biggest sovereign movers worldwide was  China , up
18 basis points to 198, after a gauge of manufacturing
contracted for a third month as measures of new orders and
export demand declined.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
