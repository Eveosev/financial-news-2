Martifer SGPS SA (MAR) , a Portuguese
manufacturer of metal structures for stadiums and windmills, is
bidding for contracts to build more athletic facilities in
Brazil ahead of soccer’s 2014 World Cup.  Martifer won a 15-million euro ($20 million) contract this
month to build metal structures for a stadium in Salvador da
Bahia -- one of 12 venues being built for the tournament -- and
is “competing for other stadiums,” Chief Executive Officer
Jorge Martins said in an e-mailed response to questions. The
Oliveira de Frades-based company may take part in other
infrastructure projects as well, said Martins.  Martifer is seeking other construction projects, “sport or
non-sport related, and is in talks with several groups to be
able to expand its order book in the short term,” said Martins.  Brazil  has budgeted $20.6 billion to construct roads,
stadiums, airports and other projects required to host soccer’s
most-watched event,  Ilan Goldfajn , chief economist of Itau
Unibanco Holding SA, said on July 28.  Martifer is building a 12 million-euro factory in  Sao
Paulo , to support its expansion in the region, Martins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
