The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment fell,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index dropped 8 basis points to
198.5 basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. A decline of 8 basis points would be the most since
Sept. 16, while a close of 198.5 would be the lowest since Sept.
21, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 6 basis points to 232 as of
8:26 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 4 basis points to
210 basis points as of 10:22 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
