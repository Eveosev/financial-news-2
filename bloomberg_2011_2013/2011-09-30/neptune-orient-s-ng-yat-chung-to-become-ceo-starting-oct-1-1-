Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.,
 Southeast Asia ’s biggest shipping line, said Ng Yat Chung will
become its new chief executive officer starting Oct. 1,
succeeding  Ron Widdows .  Ng, 49, will take over the job earlier than the initially
planned Jan. 1 because of the global economic uncertainties, the
company said today in a statement to the  Singapore  stock
exchange. Widdows, 58, will become the shipping line’s senior
adviser.  “We both feel strongly that it is in the best interest of
the company that the new leadership begins to drive the company
and shape these important decisions now and not wait until
2012,” Ng said in the statement.  Ng, who was hired in April to succeed Widdows, will helm
Neptune Orient at a time when the sovereign-debt crisis in
 Europe  and economic uncertainties in the U.S. caused rates to
plunge. The Singaporean company said on Aug. 12 that it will
post a full-year loss unless conditions improve.  Ng spent 28 years in Singapore’s Armed Forces and was the
defense force chief before he joined Singapore state investment
company Temasek, which owns 67 percent of Neptune Orient,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
