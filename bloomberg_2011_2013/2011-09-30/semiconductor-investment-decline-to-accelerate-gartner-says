Semiconductor makers may cut
worldwide capital-equipment investment by 19 percent in 2012,
more than estimated earlier, as slowing economic growth causes
sales to drop, according to research company Gartner Inc.  Industry spending on chip production capacity will total
$35.2 billion next year compared with an estimated $43.5 billion
in 2011,  Stamford , Connecticut-based Gartner said today in a
 report . The drop is steeper than a 2.6 percent reduction that
Gartner predicted in June. Investment cutbacks have already
started and will last until mid-2012, it said.  “The slowdown appears to be across the board,” Klaus Rinnen, managing vice president at Gartner, said in the note.
Investment in producing NAND-technology chips has also
“softened” because of weaker-than-expected growth in
manufacturing tablet devices, he said.  Gartner reversed its forecast for industrywide sales of
semiconductors for 2011 on Sept. 15, predicting a 0.1 percent
decline instead of an increase. Excess electronics inventory and
“poor” chip volume are to blame for the capital spending
decline, it said today. Supply and demand will be more in
balance by mid-2012, and the next growth year will be 2013, with
an 22 percent increase in equipment investment, according to
Gartner.  The Stoxx 600 Technology Index, led by German chipmaker
Infineon Technologies AG, fell as much as 2.1 percent and was
down 1.9 percent as of 10:58 a.m. in  London . The index has
declined 4.2 percent in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
