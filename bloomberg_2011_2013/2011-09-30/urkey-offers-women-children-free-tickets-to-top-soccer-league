Turkey  will give free tickets to
top level soccer matches to women and children in a bid to
eradicate violence and bad language.  For the remainder of the season, the Turkish Football
Federation will pay clubs the admission fees for women and
children under 16, according to a  statement  on the Istanbul-
based authority’s website. There will be sections of stadiums
reserved for women and children, who will have their own
entrances, it said.   Having more women at soccer grounds will “contribute to
preventing violence and disorder, stopping ugly and offensive
slogans, and creating a match atmosphere in which families feel
comfortable,” it said.  The federation is building on the success of a decision to
stop punishing clubs for bad behavior by banning all spectators.
This month it barred men from a Fenerbahce game and allowed only
women and children into the ground, which was filled with more
than 41,000 fans.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
