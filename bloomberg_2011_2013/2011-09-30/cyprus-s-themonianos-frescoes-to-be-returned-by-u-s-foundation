Frescoes from a medieval Cypriot
chapel that were acquired by the Houston-based  Dominique de
Menil Foundation  after  Turkey ’s 1974 occupation of northern
Cyprus are to be returned to the island.  The frescoes were taken from the 13th-century chapel of St.
Themonianos, near Famagusta, and the foundation acquired them
from Turkish antiquities smugglers in the 1980s with the
encouragement of the Cypriot government, which wanted to prevent
their destruction, according to the island’s  Greek Orthodox
Church .  Under a 1986 loan agreement, the foundation was permitted
to keep the frescoes for a 15-year period, later extended. The
accord expires in February and the frescoes will be returned
because the Cypriot church has refused a further extension,
Archbishop Chrysostomos told reporters in Nicosia today.  “We are prepared to offer in return 10 icons of the late
19th and early 20th century,” he said.  The frescoes will be displayed in Nicosia’s Byzantine
Museum, which is run by the church.  Turkey invaded Cyprus in response to a coup inspired by the
military junta then in power in  Greece . “Following the
invasion, all our churches were desecrated, all frescoes removed
and Turkish smugglers stole antique icons and consecrated
vessels,” Chrysostomos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
