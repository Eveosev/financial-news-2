Corn advanced, paring its worst
monthly loss since 2008, on speculation that a report today will
show a decline in U.S. stockpiles. Wheat and soybeans increased.  The December-delivery contract gained as much as 0.6
percent to $6.36 per bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and
was at $6.3575 at 10:37 a.m. in  Singapore .  Corn lost 17.2 percent this month as investors sold off
commodities from metals to farm products on concern the global
economy may lapse back recession. The  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  is scheduled to release its report today on
inventories left before the start of this year’s harvest.  “Corn stocks are expected to be low,” Lynette Tan, an
analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said by phone from Singapore.
“Year-on-year, it’s definitely lower. In the long term we know
it’s still a short supply.”  U.S. stockpiles may have declined to 882 million bushels
as of Sept. 1, about 38 million bushels less than the USDA’s
latest estimate, Morgan Stanley analysts led by  Hussein Allidina 
wrote in a report e-mailed Sept. 28. That would be the  smallest 
total for period since 1995, and down from 1.7 billion bushels a
year ago, according to USDA data.  Export Sales  Global corn production will trail demand for a third
straight year in 2011-2012, according to a USDA forecast on Sept.
12. World stockpiles may plunge to 117.4 million metric tons at
the end of the 2011-2012 season, the lowest level in five years,
the USDA said.  U.S. export sales of soybeans in the week ended Sept. 22
more than doubled to 1.03 million tons from a week earlier, the
USDA said yesterday.  Shipments  to  China , the largest consumer,
accounted for 82 percent. Corn exports rose 32 percent to
787,887 tons, including 182,100 tons to China.  November-delivery soybeans advanced as much as 0.5 percent
to $12.3625 per bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures
traded at $12.3525, set for a 15 percent decline this month.  Egypt , the world’s biggest wheat importer, bought 120,000
tons of Russian wheat and 120,000 tons of Kazakh wheat in a
tender, said Nomani Nomani, the vice chairman of the  General
Authority  for Supply Commodities.  Wheat for December delivery climbed 1.1 percent to $6.615
per bushel. Futures are headed for a 16 percent loss this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
