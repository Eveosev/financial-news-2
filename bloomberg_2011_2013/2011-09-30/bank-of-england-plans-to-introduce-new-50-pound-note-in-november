The  Bank of England  will introduce
a new 50-pound ($78) note in November that will feature enhanced
security features, it said today.  The note will have portraits of Matthew Boulton, an
entrepreneur who contributed to the rise of Birmingham as an
industrial center, and James Watt, an engineer who made
improvements in the steam engine. The two started a partnership
in 1775 that lead to greater efficiencies in the engine and
lowered running costs, according to information provided by the
central bank in London.  Their portraits replace that of Sir John Houblon, the first
governor of the central bank.  As of February 2011, the value of 50-pound banknotes in
circulation was 9.9 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
