Opap SA (OPAP) ,  Europe ’s biggest listed
gambling company, will pay the Greek government 935 million
euros ($1.3 billion) for an extension of its betting monopoly
and a video lottery terminal license.  The 10-year extension of the monopoly will cost 375 million
euros, according to an  Athens bourse  filing today. Opap will
also pay the state 5 percent of gross profit for the 10 years
through October 2030. The license to operate 35,000 terminals
will cost 560 million euros.  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said last week
he’ll raise 1.4 billion euros in September and meet a third-
quarter target of 1.7 billion euros next month, as the nation
struggles to meet goals set by the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  under the terms of a May 2010
bailout.  Venizelos last week revised down the state-asset sales
revenue target for this year to 4 billion euros, from 5 billion
euros previously, amid low stock values and delays in
implementing the program.  Greece aims to raise 50 billion euros through 2015 to help
pay down its debt.  Opap, of which the Greek state holds 34 percent, currently
has a monopoly on sports betting in the country until 2020. The
company will pay 474 million euros of the total terminal license
value as soon as the final deal is signed and 86 million euros
over 24 months after the permit is issued, according to the
filing.  Under new gaming legislation Opap was granted the right to
a license to operate a total of 35,000 video-lottery terminals,
of which 18,500 have to be subcontracted. The bill went into
effect Aug. 22.  A general meeting will be called soon, because the deal
needs shareholder approval, according to the bourse filing.  Opap rose 3.1 percent to 7.78 euros at 10:43 a.m. in Athens
trading, rising for a fifth day. Opap is down 40 percent this
year on  Greece ’s FTSE 20 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
