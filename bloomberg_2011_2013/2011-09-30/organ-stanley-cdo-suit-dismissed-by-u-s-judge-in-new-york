Morgan Stanley (MS)  won dismissal of a
retirement fund’s lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation
called the Libertas CDO.  The Employees’ Retirement System of the Government of the
Virgin Islands claimed in the 2009 suit that New York-based
Morgan Stanley defrauded investors by collaborating with ratings
companies to give the CDO an undeserved AAA rating at the same
time it was short-selling almost all of the assets underlying
the notes. The CDO was backed by $1.2 billion in assets,
according to the complaint.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in  Manhattan  today
dismissed the investor complaint, which asserted claims for
fraud and unjust enrichment under  New York  state law.  AAA is the highest rating for fixed-income instruments. The
portfolio was 92 percent residential mortgage-backed securities
and included exposure to more than $130 million in loans from
Option One Mortgage Corp. and $100 million from New Century
Mortgage Corp., both lenders to homebuyers with poor credit
scores, according to the complaint.  The Libertas CDO entered into credit-default swaps that
referenced specific residential mortgage-backed securities.
According to the complaint, the notes collapsed in value after
they were purchased by the Virgin Islands retirement fund.  The case is Employees’ Retirement System of the Government
of the Virgin Islands v.  Morgan Stanley & Co ., 09-cv-10532, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
