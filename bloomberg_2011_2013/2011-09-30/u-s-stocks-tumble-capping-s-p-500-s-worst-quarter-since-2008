U.S. stocks fell this week, capping
the worst quarterly loss for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
since the end of 2008, as the sovereign debt crisis in  Europe 
and fears of a global slowdown overshadowed improving economic
reports in the U.S.  Alcoa Inc. and  Intel Corp . lost more than 3.7 percent as
economic reports from China and Germany fueled investor concerns
the world economy may contract.  Micron Technology Inc. (MU)  slid 24
percent after reporting an unexpected loss, while Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. cut its sales forecast, sending the shares down 18
percent.  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  rallied 13 percent after
Germany approved an expansion of a European bailout fund.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent to
1,131.42, dropping for a second straight week after a 2.5
percent drop on the final day erased earlier advances. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  rose 141.9 points, or 1.3 percent, to
10,913.38, after declining 6.4 percent the previous week.  “It’s been a horrific quarter, and investors are feeling
bruised and battered across the board,” Alex Tedder, senior
portfolio manager for American Century Investments in New York,
who manages about $7 billion in global stocks, said in a
telephone interview. “We’re coming from a background that is
extremely depressed and extremely uncertain with the big
question mark over growth that we have globally.”  Quarterly Loss  The week’s decline brought the S&P 500 to a quarterly loss
of 14 percent, the worst drop since the three months ending
December 2008, when the index lost 23 percent amid its worst
plunge since the Great Depression. The  S&P 500  has declined in
nine out 13 weeks in the quarter. For the year, the S&P 500 is
down 10 percent. The Dow dropped 12 percent for the quarter, and
has lost 5.7 percent for the year so far.  Investors dumped equities in the third quarter as concern
increased that Europe’s debt crisis will trigger a global
recession and the  Federal Reserve  said there are “significant
downside risks” to the  U.S. economy . The S&P 500 slumped as
much as 18 percent from its high in April, as European finance
chiefs clashed over how to assist  Greece  and American lawmakers
struggled to agree on raising the federal government’s debt
limit. The benchmark equity index fell to a low of 1,119.46 on
Aug. 8 after S&P cut the country’s credit rating.  Stocks advanced early in the week amid optimism that Europe
would contain its debt crisis, as  Germany ’s lower house of
parliament approved expanding the European bailout fund.
Optimism faded amid growing concern policy makers were divided
on how to solve the crisis, and as investors increasingly
shifted their focus to the global economy.  China Manufacturing  A report this week showed a gauge of Chinese manufacturing
shrank a third month, the longest contraction since 2009, as
measures of new orders and export demand fell.  U.S. economic reports signaling improvements weren’t enough
to keep stocks elevated. Labor Department figures showed
applications for jobless claims fell to a lower number than was
estimated by economists for the week ended Sept. 24. Orders for
U.S. capital goods climbed in August by the most in three
months, according to a Commerce Department report.  “We have gotten some incrementally good news here
domestically, but that’s just still overshadowed by the issues
in Europe,”  Walter Todd , who helps manage $940 million at
 Greenwood Capital  in Greenwood,  South Carolina , said in a
telephone interview. “There’s still a lot of unknowns.”  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, more than doubled this quarter to 42.96, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The gauge has averaged 20.45 over
its 20-year history. It hasn’t doubled since 1998, and this
quarter’s gain marked the biggest advance ever, the data show.  Raw Materials   Shares of raw-material companies led declines among 10 S&P
500 industries, losing 3.2 percent as a group for the week.
Alcoa fell 5 percent to $9.57. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index
of companies most-tied to economic growth lost 0.7 percent,
ending the quarter with its worst drop since the end of 2008.
Intel lost 3.7 percent to $21.34.  Fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings Inc. slipped 15
percent to $123.39 as the U.S. government said pre-harvest corn
inventories fell less than analysts forecast.  Micron Technology, the largest U.S. maker of computer-
memory chips, reported an unexpected loss on weak demand for
personal computers. The shares slid 24 percent to $5.04.
Advanced Micro Devices lost 18 percent to $5.08.  Genworth gained 13 percent to $5.74 this week, while
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B shares added 7 percent to $71.04
as the company plans a stock buyback.  Netflix Tumbles  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. plunged 61 percent for the
quarter, leading the S&P 500 lower, while Netflix Inc. dropped
57 percent. Netflix, the U.S. online and mail-order video
service, tumbled after Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
unveiled competing products and its own rebranding alienated
customers and drove away investors.  For the quarter, utility stocks were the only group in the
S&P 500 to advance, rising 0.4 percent. S&P 500 companies will
start to report earnings for the third quarter this month, with
Alcoa expected to post results Oct. 11. Analysts have lowered
their estimates for 2011 profits by 0.9 percent to $99.23 a
share since the start of September.  The S&P 500’s valuation measure based on reported earnings
slipped 15 percent in the three months ending Sept. 30 to 12.4,
the biggest quarterly contraction since June 2010, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The index is trading near its lowest point
since March 2009, about the time the  bull market  that added as
much as 102 percent began.  Trading Range  Since August, the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities has
traded between about 1,100 and 1,300, as investors swayed
between positive reports on the world’s largest economy and its
corporations and speculation that the European debt crisis was
growing. The index is forecast to reach 1,305 by the end of the
year, according to strategists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “If nothing happens and if the crisis keeps spreading, I
think we are on a path for global recession,”  Thomas Lee , the
New York-based chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase &
Co. said in a Bloomberg Television interview Sept. 29. “But
that’s kind of like saying someone took their hand off the
steering wheel and no one is trying to grab it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
