Former National Security Adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this
weekend, that the deadlock in the Middle East peace process is
undermining U.S. influence and may pose an existential threat to
America’s key ally Israel.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with former National Security
Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, who joins us in our studio. Dr.
Brzezinski, thank you for being here.  ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI: Nice to be with you.  HUNT: Let’s start with Russia.  Vladimir Putin  going to come
back and be president, maybe through 2024. Your take?  BRZEZINSKI: In some ways, it’s not unexpected, because
everybody knew that Putin was the real power and Medvedev just a
front, yet it was still a bit of a surprise, because it
eliminated what was still one major hope regarding  Russia  in the
near future, namely that this current arrangement would
continue, and that created small openings for more democracy,
for more serious discussion -  HUNT: And this closes that?  BRZEZINSKI: And this closes that. And that’s too bad.  HUNT: And what are the implications for U.S.-Russian
relations and Russian cooperation in areas like Iran and the
Middle East?  BRZEZINSKI: I would say fundamentally not much, because
after all, it wasn’t Medvedev. It was Putin who was making the
decisions in the background. But the tone of the relationship
will be less friendly. The possibility of Putin again bursting
out with some complaints or some of their openly expressed
nostalgia for the past, for the imperial past of Russia, that
can happen again.  HUNT: Speaking of U.S. relationships, our relationships
with  Pakistan  seem to have hit a low,  Admiral Mullen  infuriating
them by saying that the Haqqani terrorist network is a veritable
arm of the ISI. Reports they were involved in the ambush in our
embassy and they killed an Army major four or five years ago.  What should we do now?  BRZEZINSKI: Well, first of all, I would like to know
whether Admiral Mullen’s statement was orchestrated in advance.
Did the U.S. decide to have him say that, the National Security
Council, the president, the commander in chief, or not?  HUNT: I’ve been told the White House knew that.  BRZEZINSKI: That’s very important. If we did do that
deliberately, then the question arises, what are we going to do
about it? Because if we did it deliberately, we had to ask
ourselves, what are going to be the consequences, not just for
us, but also for them? How might they react? What should we be
doing about it?  What I’m worried about is that this may have been some
instinctive, impulsive decision or one made casually, but not
thought through strategically.  What we have to face I think now, going beyond that
specific incident, is that there are several Pakistans existing
at the same time. And by this, I do not mean just the democratic
structure, the furniture (ph), and the army, and the ISI, and
then the extremists. I also mean that within each of these
segments, there are sub-segments. It’s a very fractured country.  And we have some Pakistans as our friends. We have some
Pakistans as kind of neutral regarding us and the Taliban. And
we have some Pakistans - we obviously now (ph) - quite hostile
to us. And we have to maneuver between them.  HUNT: As you know, another top al-Qaeda operative, al-
Awlaki, was killed by drones this weekend. Are we just wiping
out all of al-Qaeda, or can they simply replace whoever we wipe
out?  BRZEZINSKI: Well, they can certainly replace them, but
whether they can replace them at the same level of competence
and same degree of unity, that is to say al-Qaeda as a large
transnational terrorist organization, that I think is open to
questions. And therefore, there’s no doubt that it is a tactical
step forward in dealing with the threat. It is not a strategic
breakthrough, but a significant tactical breakthrough which
points towards the gradual fragmentation of al-Qaeda into
autonomous national components and then probably towards a
disappearance of any united strategy for al-Qaeda. So it’s
progress. It’s progress.  HUNT: So that’s progress. Let me turn to the  Middle East ,
 Syria . The Europeans and the Americans seem to agree that Assad
should go, but what should we do? What can be done now?  BRZEZINSKI: Well, quite frankly, I don’t think we can do
very much. The Europeans, as the former imperial powers in the
region, really have limited capacity and are not very welcome.  And secondly, our position in the Middle East is just
declining so rapidly that it’s really appalling. We went into
the Middle East 50 years ago or so, a little more than 50 years,
55 years ago, at the invitation of the Arabs, who wanted the
British and the French displaced. We were welcomed. At one
point, we had good relations with  Iran ,  Saudi Arabia ,  Egypt , and
 Turkey . Each in a different was a close friend.  We barely have a decent relationship with some of them now.
And some of them are gradually turning away from us. I think
we’re stuck, and I deplore the fact that we don’t have a policy.
We don’t have a policy. And as a consequence, we are in the
process of being pushed out.  HUNT: What would a post-Assad Syria look like, would you
think?  BRZEZINSKI: Well, it depends on who influences the outcome.
If it’s the Iranians, it will be some sort of a mild version of
what we see in Iran. If it is the Turks, it might be a mild, but
hopeful version of what we see in Turkey. But we have very
little influence there.  HUNT: Well, let’s go to what you were talking about, the
overall - what you consider, you know, bad American policy there
in the Middle East. What would you like to see the  United States 
do?  BRZEZINSKI: Well, for one thing, we have to face something
that some people are not willing to face. Every public opinion
poll tells us, every single one, that the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is a salient issue for the publics in the region.  Until recently, we could ignore that, because we dealt with
the governments and not with the publics. But now the publics
are becoming more important. And that means that this issue
continues to fester. The Middle East will become more anti-
American. We are in the process of being pushed out, as I said.
And eventually,  Israel  is going to be fatally threatened.  My view is, we should have been doing what we were saying
we were doing, but which we have never done very consistently:
face the fact that, given the complexities, the histories, the
geographies, so much at variance between Israel and the
Palestinians, the two sides on their own will never reach
agreement by their own.  We have not been willing to move up to the plate. The
president started moving as if he would, and then, you know, he
made a speech at the UN, which was extremely limited in scope
and for which he received a badge of honor from Netanyahu, which
I’m not sure is a terribly flattering thing for the president of
a large country to find himself being given.  We don’t have a policy right now. And as a result, I think
the issue’s going to get worse, rather than better.  And there is a way out, incidentally. For example, if we
could - instead of vetoing the Palestinian resolution, which is
going to be a blot in our discussion vis-a-vis the Middle East
for years to come, we supported heroically Israel 60 years ago.
We should be willing to do the same for the Palestinians.  If instead of that we introduce the resolution welcoming
the existence of a democratic Jewish state in Israel -explicitly
- at the same time saying the Palestinians are entitled to
something similar, negotiations should be resumed on the basis
of et cetera, et cetera, as Obama said, ‘67 frontiers, and the
United States and the quartet propose that, then quietly the
Israelis at the last moment could even vote for it.  HUNT: Right. Right.  BRZEZINSKI: Because they wouldn’t lose anything from that.
And I think the atmosphere would change. It would be a win-win-
win situation for the three parties.  HUNT: Dr. Brzezinski, thank you so much for being with us
today. We covered a lot of ground.  BRZEZINSKI: Good to be with you.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
