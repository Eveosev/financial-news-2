Spanish lenders NCG Banco,
Catalunya Banc and Unnim Banc, which were created this year as
part of the restructuring of  Spain ’s savings bank system, won
temporary European Union approval for their recapitalizations.  “Strengthening the capital of these banks is paramount to
their ability to continue lending to the real economy and to
implement the restructuring that they will need to undergo as a
result of the significant subsidies received from the”
country’s bank-rescue fund, EU Competition Commissioner
 Joaquin Almunia  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Final approval by the European Commission, the 27-nation
EU’s executive agency, depends on the submission of a
restructuring plan “that ensures that the banks will be viable
in the long-term, that shareholders adequately share the burden
of restructuring and that distortions of competitions are
limited,” said the Brussels-based regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
