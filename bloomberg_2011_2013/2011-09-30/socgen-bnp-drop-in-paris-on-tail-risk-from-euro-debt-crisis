Societe Generale SA and  BNP Paribas (BNP) 
SA,  France ’s largest banks, fell in Paris trading after UBS AG
cut its price targets on the stocks, citing “tail risk” from
political delay in tackling the euro-region debt crisis.  Societe Generale, France’s second-largest bank, tumbled as
much as 13 percent and was down 8.4 percent at 19.31 euros by
3:25 p.m. in Paris, giving the company a market value of 15
billion euros ($20 billion). BNP Paribas, the country’s biggest
lender, declined 5.6 percent at 29.40 euros.  “Markets continue to lose confidence and funding becomes
more strained,” London-based UBS analyst Omar Fall wrote in a
note today. “Although there is value under most scenarios for
SocGen and BNP, tail risk of a disorderly policy decision will
be priced in until the macro situation is resolved.”  UBS cut the rating on  Societe Generale (GLE)  to neutral from buy
and reduced its price target by 40 percent to 21 euros. While
UBS retained its neutral rating on BNP Paribas, its price target
was cut 14 percent to 31 euros.  European leaders are turning their focus to the next steps
to stem the region’s debt crisis after German lawmakers approved
an expansion of the euro-area rescue fund’s firepower. With the
European Commission now expecting the overhauled 440 billion-
euro European Financial Stability Facility in place by mid-
October, euro finance chiefs will next week discuss accelerating
enactment of a permanent rescue fund that provides more capital
and a tool for managing defaults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
