The Czech Republic’s PX stock index
fell 0.8 percent to 933.9 at its 4:28 p.m. close in  Prague ,
paring this week’s gains to 8.1 percent. The benchmark has lost
11 percent this month and 24 percent since the end of June.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility,
retreated 0.5 percent to 710 koruna, reducing its advance this
week to 4.6 percent. Electricity for next-year delivery in
 Germany , where CEZ exports part of its output, slipped 0.8
percent to 56.45 euros per megawatt-hour.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   retreated 3 percent to 480
koruna. The Austrian lender was still 18 percent higher this
week. It lost 21 percent in September and 44 percent in the
third quarter. Banks led European shares lower as reports
showing contractions in Chinese manufacturing and German retail
sales added to concern the global economy is slowing.  New World Resources Plc (NWR CP), the biggest supplier of
coal to steelmakers in the  Czech Republic , slumped 2.4 percent
to 131.8 koruna, its second day of declines.  Europe ’s benchmark
futures contracts for the commodity fell the first day in four.  To contact the reporter on this story:
