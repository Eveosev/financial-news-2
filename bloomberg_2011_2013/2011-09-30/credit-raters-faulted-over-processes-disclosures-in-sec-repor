Credit-rating firms sometimes
failed to follow their own ratings processes, make accurate
disclosures or manage conflicts of interest, the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s staff said in a report on the industry.  The 10 firms registered with the SEC as nationally
recognized statistical ratings organizations, or NRSROs, have
already begun responding to recommendations in today’s report,
the agency’s first under rules imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act.
Lawmakers directed the SEC to increase scrutiny of raters after
the firms were faulted for helping spark the 2008 credit crisis
with inflated grades on securitized debt.  “We expect the  credit rating agencies  to address the
concerns we have raised in a timely and effective way, and we
will be monitoring their progress as part of our ongoing annual
examinations,” Norm Champ, deputy director of the SEC’s Office
of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, said in a statement.  Dodd-Frank, the regulatory overhaul enacted last year,
required the SEC to set up an independent office to oversee
credit ratings. The formation of that office has been blocked by
 House Republicans  who have criticized the agency’s performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
