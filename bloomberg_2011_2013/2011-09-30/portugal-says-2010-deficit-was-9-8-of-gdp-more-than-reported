Portugal ’s budget deficit last year
was 9.8 percent of gross domestic product, more than previously
announced, after unreported debt of the island region of Madeira
was included.  The revision “essentially” reflects debt and spending not
reported earlier by Madeira, the National Statistics Institute
said in an e-mailed statement today. The government and the
institute previously said the 2010 shortfall was 9.1 percent of
GDP. The deficit for the first six months of 2011  was 8.3
percent, down from 10.4 percent a year earlier.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending and
raising taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($106
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund . As the country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal
followed Greece and Ireland in April in seeking a bailout. The
government has already announced a one-time income-tax surcharge
to help cover a budget shortfall this year.  The deficit of 9.8 percent in 2010 “was already expected
due to the events in Madeira,” said Cristina Casalinho, chief
economist at Banco BPI SA in Lisbon. It’s possible that more
austerity measures are needed, she said. “It will depend a lot
on revenue and spending in the remaining months of 2011. We
believe the targets will be met.”  Fiscal Targets  The government aims to trim the deficit to 5.9 percent in
2011 and within the EU ceiling of 3 percent in 2013. Debt will
reach 100.8 percent of GDP this year and peak at 106.8 percent
in 2013 before starting to decline, the government predicted on
Aug. 31. Debt was 93.3 percent of GDP in 2010, the statistics
institute said today.  The Bank of Portugal and the statistics institute said on
Sept. 16 that Madeira had unreported debts. The  Finance Ministry 
said that day it had no knowledge of other unreported debt or
spending and considers Madeira an “isolated case.”  The region of Madeira had debt of 6.3 billion euros at the
end of the first half, Portuguese Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar
said in Lisbon today. The government doesn’t plan any more tax
increases this year, he said.  Madeira didn’t report debts or expenses that had a combined
impact of 1.2 billion euros on the 2008, 2009 and 2010 deficits,
the statistics institute said today.  The government needs to improve control over expenditure
and cut spending to meet its budget-gap targets as it seeks to
regain access to bond markets in 2013, the IMF said in a report
released on Sept. 13.  Portugal’s economy will contract 2.2 percent this year and
between 2.2 percent and 2.3 percent in 2012, before expanding
1.2 percent in 2013, according to government forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
