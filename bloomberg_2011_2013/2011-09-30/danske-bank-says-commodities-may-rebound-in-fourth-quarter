Commodities demand may rebound in
the fourth quarter as  China  will be “growing healthier” in the
next few months, Danske Bank A/S said.  Copper is the metal to watch for a turnaround because of
its importance to China, the world’s largest buyer of the metal,
the bank said in an e-mailed report today. The aluminum price
forecast for the second half of 2012 was raised because delays
in higher  interest rates  will mean metal is going to stay tied
up in financing deals, according to the report.  Aluminum will average $2,550 in the third quarter of 2012
and $2,600 in the following three months, Danske Bank said.
Copper will average $8,250 a ton in the fourth quarter this
year, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
