Gulf Coast  gasoline advanced as
Motiva Enterprises LLC reduced feed to a unit yesterday at its
Norco, Louisiana, refinery.  A wet gas compressor tripped offline, according to a  filing 
with the National Response Center. Jill Davis, a spokeswoman for
the 250,000-barrel-a-day refinery, declined to comment. Motiva
is a joint venture of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Saudi Arabian
Oil Co.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast increased 0.88 cent to 0.5 cent versus futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in New York at 12:59 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained
2.36 cents to $2.5785 a gallon.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest rose 1.13 cents to a discount of 0.5 cent a gallon,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
3.65 cents to $2.6395 a gallon.  Motiva will shut a hydrocracker at the refinery Oct. 6 for
planned work that is scheduled to last about 30 days, a person
familiar with the work said Aug. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
