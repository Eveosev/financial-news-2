Fluor Corp. (FLR)  has dropped a protest
filed last month with the Government Accountability Office
challenging a $500 million award to  KBR Inc. (KBR)  for a logistics
support contract in Iraq, according to KBR and a government
website.  Irving, Texas-based Fluor withdrew its protest Wednesday,
according to the GAO’s website and KBR spokeswoman Gabriela Segura in an e-mail. Fluor spokesman Keith Stephens said the
company had no comment.  The contract was on hold until the protest was resolved.
The hold has been lifted, said Army Sustainment Command
spokeswoman Linda Theis.  Houston, Texas-based KBR announced August 2 it will
continue for the State Department its previous Iraq role
providing base support after U.S. troops are scheduled to
withdraw in December.  KBR will support the State Department’s embassy staff,
including utilities management, fire fighting, food services,
laundry, shuttle bus services, fuel and postal operations.  The one-year contract includes a one-year option.  KBR has not received any similar contracts for  Afghanistan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
