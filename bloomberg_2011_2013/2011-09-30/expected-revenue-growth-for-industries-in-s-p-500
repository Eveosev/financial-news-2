The following table details the expected
quarterly and annual year-over-year revenue growth for 
industry groups in the Standard and Poorâ€™s 500 Index.  Percentages are calculated using Bloomberg revenue estimates for
the current period compared with actual figures from a year ago.
Companies are then grouped together by industry and summed for each
period to calculate the percentage growth.  * -- Fiscal year revenue from each company was used to calculate the growth,
it might not add up from the quarterly revenue growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
