The London Stock Exchange and
 Singapore Exchange  declined to comment on a Reuters report that
they were planning a joint bit for the London Metal Exchange.  Ed Clark, a spokesman for the London Stock Exchange, said
it doesn’t comment on speculation and Joan Liew, a spokeswoman
for the Singapore Exchange, said it doesn’t comment on market
rumors.  The LME said Sept. 23 it had received “several expressions
of interest.’’ Those now exceed 10 and will probably expand
further, LME Chief Executive Officer  Martin Abbott  said in an
interview Sept. 28. Chris Evans from the exchange declined to 
comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
