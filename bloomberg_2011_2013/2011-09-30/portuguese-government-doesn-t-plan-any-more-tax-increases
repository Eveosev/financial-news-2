The Portuguese government doesn’t
plan any more tax increases, Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said
in a press conference in Lisbon today.  The government will rely on the other measures it had
already announced to reach this year’s budget deficit target,
such as the transfer of some Portuguese banks’ pension funds, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
