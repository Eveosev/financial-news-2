Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  Chairman Luis
Del Rivero’s decision to seal a pact with Petroleos Mexicanos
and demand changes in the running of  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  has divided
the Sacyr board, Europa Press reported.  Juan Abello, Sacyr’s deputy chairman, walked out of
Repsol’s board meeting on Sept. 28 and abstained from voting
alongside the construction company’s two other representatives,
the agency said citing people close to him without naming them.  The people said Abello doesn’t agree with the way the
dispute has been handled, the agency reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
