Turkey ’s inflation rate may fall in
September, central bank govenor Erdem Basci said.  The decline will be temporary and the rate will rise again
toward the end of the year, he told businessmen in Edirne,
western Turkey, in televised remarks.  There’s a high chance Turkey will meet its goal of 5
percent inflation in 2012, Basci said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
