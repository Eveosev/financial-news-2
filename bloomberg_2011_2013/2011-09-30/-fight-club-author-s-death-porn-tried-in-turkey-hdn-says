The Turkish publisher and
translator of Chuck Palahniuk’s new novel “Snuff” may be
jailed for “publishing of obscene material” in  Turkey ,
 Hurriyet Daily News  reported today.  The title of the new book by the author of “Fight Club”
was translated as “Death Porn” in Turkish and is
“incompatible with the values of Turkish society,” the
Istanbul-based newspaper cited the public prosecutor as saying.  Translator Funda Uncu said she was loyal to the original
novel, while publisher Hasan Basri Ciplak denied the
accusations, the newspaper said. The two face up to three years
in prison, it said.  The prosecutor pointed to the book’s explicit sexual
descriptions, saying countries differ in their “moral
understanding” and labeling it as obscene, Hurriyet Daily News
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
