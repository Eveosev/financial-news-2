Following is a comparison of the U.S.
market-based personal consumption price indexes and the regular
price indexes prepared by the Commerce Department.  The market-based indexes do not include most imputed prices,
or prices for which there is no direct cost measure available. The
market-based indexes do include imputed prices for owner's
equivalent rent, and thus is more comparable to the  consumer price
index  prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
