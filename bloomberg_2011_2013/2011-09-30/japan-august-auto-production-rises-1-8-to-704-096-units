Japanese automakers led by  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  posted an increase in domestic vehicle production
for the first time in 12 months as they recovered output after
the March earthquake and tsunami.  Local output in August rose 1.8 percent to 704,096
vehicles, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said
today on its  website . Exports gained 7.6 percent to 363,772
units, the Tokyo-based group said.  Japanese carmakers including Toyota have been hiring
temporary workers to boost production from October, as they aim
to make up for lost output after the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami caused shortages of parts and electricity. Toyota,
 Asia ’s biggest automaker, resumed full production at all of its
North American plants this month and said it will expand U.S.
output of small engines.  Toyota’s global output increased 10.6 percent to 626,817
vehicles in August, the first increase after the government
ended subsidies for fuel-efficient cars last September, the
Toyota City, Japan-based company said Sept. 28. Domestic output
gained 12 percent to 252,374, while overseas production rose 9.8
percent to 374,443, it said.  Shares of Toyota fell 1 percent to 2,676 yen as of 2:06
p.m. in Tokyo trading.  Toyota began recruiting temporary workers from July and
plans to add as many as 4,000 in  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
