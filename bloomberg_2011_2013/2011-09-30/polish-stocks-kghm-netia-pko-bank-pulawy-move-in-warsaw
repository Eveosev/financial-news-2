Poland’s WIG20 Index was unchanged
at 2,188.73 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw. The measure
tumbled 22 percent in the past three months, the biggest
quarterly decline since December 2008.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, declined for a third day, losing 2
zloty, or 1.5 percent, to 131 zloty. Copper fell on speculation
demand for the metal from  China , the biggest buyer, will slow
after manufacturing declined.  Netia SA (NET)   climbed 0.04 zloty, or 0.8 percent, to
4.95 zloty, its second day of gains. Poland’s second-largest
fixed-line phone operator agreed to buy Telefonia Dialog SA and
Crowley Data Poland Sp. z o.o. for a total of 1.04 billion zloty
($316 million), the company said in regulatory statements late
yesterday.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW) retreated 0.42 zloty, or 1.3
percent, to 32.9 zloty, the steepest daily decline in a week, as
UBS AG cut its recommendation for Poland’s biggest bank to
“neutral.”  Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy SA (ZAP)   advanced for a second
day, adding 2.5 zloty, or 3 percent, to 86.7 zloty. The state-
controlled fertilizer maker signed a preliminary deal to buy
rival Azoty-Adipol SA from the country’s government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
