Telenor ASA (TEL) , the largest phone
company in the Nordic region, plans to open fourth-generation
services in Malaysia, making it the first country in the
company’s Asian operations to get the new high-speed networks.  “The Malaysian economy is ready for 4G,” Chief Executive
Officer Jon Fredrik Baksaas said in an interview yesterday after
meeting Malaysia’s International Trade and Industry Minister
Mustapa Mohamed at the company’s headquarters in Fornebu,
Norway.  Telenor owns a 49 percent stake in  DiGi.Com Bhd. (DIGI) ,
Malaysia’s third-largest wireless operator. The Norwegian
company launched 4G services in Sweden in November on a network
shared with Tele2 AB, and is also rolling out 4G in Norway. 4G
networks give mobile users higher-speed Internet that carries
both voice and data.  Mohamed confirmed that DiGi’s proposal for 4G operations is
being considered. Maxis Bhd., the biggest wireless carrier in
 Malaysia , is also submitting a proposal, the Business Times
reported Sept. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
