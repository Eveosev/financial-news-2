Canada ’s dollar depreciated for a
third day versus its U.S. counterpart, touching the lowest in
more than a year, on concern a slowdown in the global economy
will crimp exports and weaken the nation’s balance sheet.  The currency recorded weekly, monthly and quarterly losses
even after a report showed Canada’s gross domestic product rose
for a second month in July on gains in manufacturing and
wholesaling. Canada’s dollar trimmed losses as traders cashed in
long greenback positions, according to  John Curran  at
CanadianForex Ltd.  “The U.S. dollar is up quite strongly over the past two
weeks and sellers are taking advantage of the overbought
signals,” said Curran, senior vice president at the online
foreign-exchange dealer, by phone from Toronto. “People are
ringing the till if they went long U.S. dollars earlier in the
week and shorting it on a technical basis.” A long position is
a bet that an asset will rise in value.  The Canadian currency dropped 1.4 percent to C$1.0503 per
U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0359
yesterday. It touched C$1.0504, the weakest level since Sept. 8,
2010. One Canadian dollar buys 95.21 U.S. cents.  Canada’s currency posted a 2.2 percent drop this week
versus the greenback among the world’s 16 most-traded
currencies. It was down 7.4 percent this month and 9 percent for
the quarter.  Dollar Balance  Curran said the Canadian dollar could weaken to C$1.0500 to
C$1.0550, “but I’m leery of any further U.S. dollar gains
unless there’s a total collapse of  Europe . I would sell U.S.
dollars up here for a test of C$1.0225.”  Investors sold the Canadian dollar for U.S. currency in
monthly rebalancing of portfolios that have lost value due to
equity declines, according to  Steve Butler  of Scotia Capital.  “It’s been a rough month and quarter for the markets,”
said Butler, managing director of foreign-exchange trading in
Toronto at the Bank of Nova Scotia unit, in an e-mail message.
“A lot of portfolio rebalancing is hurting the Canadian
dollar.”  Crude oil, Canada’s largest export, headed for its largest
quarterly decline in  New York  since the 2008 financial crisis,
15 percent as signs of slowing growth in  China , the U.S. and
 Germany  heightened concern that fuel demand will suffer. Crude
for November delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell
4.3 percent to $78.64 a barrel.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 2.5 percent,
extending the biggest quarterly drop since 2008.  Market Worries  “The U.S. dollar benefits and the Canadian dollar suffers
from the twin drags of ongoing worries about global growth and
weakness in equity markets,”  Shaun Osborne  and Greg Moore,
foreign-exchange strategists at Toronto-Dominion Bank in
Toronto, wrote in a client note today.  The greenback’s rally “puts C$1.0800 to C$1.0850 on the
radar,” the strategists wrote. “We look for intraday support
at C$1.0400 to C$1.0410.” Support refers to the lower boundary
of a trading range where buyers may emerge.  Scotia Capital ’s Butler said his target for the currency is
C$1.0640 to C$1.0650. He recommended exiting long positions if
the pair falls back below C$1.0320. A long position is a bet
that a currency will appreciate, in this case the U.S. dollar.  Government bonds  rose, pushing the 10-year note’s yield
lower by seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.15
percent. Yields increased for five straight days after dropping
to a record low 1.994 percent on Sept. 23. The price of the 3.25
percent security maturing in June 2021 gained 59 cents to
C$109.53.  Bond Returns  Canada’s government bonds have made 7.5 percent this year,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  Canada’s dollar remained lower even after the government’s
statistics agency reported gross domestic product rose 0.3
percent to C$1.26 trillion ($1.21 trillion) in July on a
seasonally adjusted basis, matching the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey with 23 responses.  The first monthly report on output for the third quarter
suggests the economy has resumed growth after shrinking in the
April-to-June period. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg last
month predict a third-quarter annualized growth rate of 2
percent, averting a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
