Axis-Shield Plc (ASD) , the maker of
Afinion diagnostic tests, said a potential bidder for the
company backed away after  Alere Inc. (ALR)  doubled its stake.  Alere, which has made a hostile, 460-pence-a-share bid for
Axis-Shield, said it owns or has agreed to acquire 29.9 percent
of the Dundee, Scotland-based company. In an earlier statement
today Waltham, Massachusetts-based Alere put its stake at 21.98
percent. The Scottish company has spurned the offer, which
expires Oct. 10, as too low.  “In recent weeks, the board has been working hard on a
conditional proposal from a third party which could have
delivered significantly higher value for Axis-Shield
shareholders,” Axis-Shield said in a statement today. “These
discussions confirmed the board’s views about the fundamental
value of the company. In light of today’s announcement by Alere,
this third party has no current intention to make an offer.”  The potential bidder reserves the right to bid should
Alere’s offer lapse or be withdrawn, Axis-Shield said.  Axis-Shield rose 7.13 pence, or 1.6 percent, to 455.5 pence
at the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in  London , giving the company
a market value of 227.7 million pounds ($354.9 million). Alere
fell 97 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $19.65 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  Alere on Sept. 26 lowered the percentage of Axis-Shield
shares needed to complete the purchase to more than 50 percent
from 90 percent. The U.S. company will seek to delist Axis-
Shield shares from the London Stock Exchange if it wins more
than 75 percent of the shares, and if it surpasses 90 percent
will acquire the remaining stock in a compulsory buyout, as
allowed by U.K. law, Alere said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
