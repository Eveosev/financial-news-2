Business activity at greater
Cincinnati area factories picked up in September as new orders
fell, according to the latest report from the National
Association of Purchasing Management-Cincinnati.  The association’s monthly index of regional manufacturing
rose to 61 this month from 59.3 in August. The composite 
prices index fell to 33 from 37. An index above 50 means 
more of the region’s manufacturer’s see business activity 
increasing, as opposed to decreasing.   Following is a table compiled from the September Cincinnati
Purchasers survey:   SOURCE: National Association of Purchasing Management- Cincinnati.  To contact the reporter on this story:
