SunPower Corp. (SPWRA) , a solar
manufacturer majority-owned by  Total SA (FP) , sold to NRG Energy Inc.
a project in Southern California that is backed by a U.S. loan
guarantee.  NRG completed the acquisition today immediately prior to
the U.S. Energy Department’s announcement of a $1.24 billion
loan guarantee for the project, the Princeton, New Jersey-based
company said in a statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The 250-megawatt California Valley Solar Ranch project in
San Luis Obispo County will sell electricity to PG&E Corp., the
state’s largest utility, the Energy Department said today on its
 website . SunPower expects to complete construction in 2013. NRG
will jointly operate and maintain the project for two years,
then assume full responsibility of operations.  The deadline for completing loan guarantees was today. The
Energy Department’s program has come under scrutiny from
lawmakers in Washington following Solyndra LLC’s Sept. 6
bankruptcy filing. The Fremont, California-based solar-panel
maker received a $535 million loan guarantee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
