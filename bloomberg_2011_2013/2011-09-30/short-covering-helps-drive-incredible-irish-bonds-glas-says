 The “incredible performance” of
Irish bonds in recent days may be driven in part by investors
covering shorts, according to Glas Securities, the Dublin-based
fixed-income firm.  “We believe the move to be technical and largely driven by
short covering and quarter-end dynamics as opposed to a sudden
surge in investor appetite at these levels,” Glas said in a
note today. “That being said, the market is now clearly
of the view that Ireland has every possibility of being the
exception to the euro-zone rule and until there is evidence to
the contrary or the euro-zone situation deteriorates further,
this sentiment is set to continue.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
