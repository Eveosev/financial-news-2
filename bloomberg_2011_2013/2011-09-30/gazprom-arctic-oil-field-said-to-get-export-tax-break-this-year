OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s biggest
company by market value, may get a 10-year  tax exemption  for
crude oil exported from its offshore Prirazlomnoye development
in the Arctic where production is set to start next year.  The government is waiting for Gazprom to provide economic
forecasts before granting the break, said two government
officials, who declined to be identified before the exemption is
approved. The project will probably not be able to turn a profit
without the tax relief, they said.  Prirazlomnoye is Russia’s first major offshore oil project
in the Arctic. The project has received a temporary exemption
from the mineral extraction tax.  Production drilling on the offshore project is planned for
about the first quarter of next year, with output planned to
peak at about 6 million to 6.5 million metric tons a year in
2019. The project’s platform and 40 wells may cost $7 billion in
total, Nikolay Kabanov, a Gazprom deputy department head, said
in  St. Petersburg  on Sept. 13.  Gazprom spokesman  Sergei Kupriyanov  didn’t immediately
answer calls to his mobile phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
