Diesel premiums to gasoil in  Europe 
rose as Royal Dutch Shell Plc shut its Singapore refinery
following a fire that lasted two days. BP Plc and Total SA were
buyers in the jet fuel market.  Gasoil traded on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange
decreased as crude fell. Front-month heating oil futures prices
are 9 percent lower than a month ago. Gasoline declined.  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate loading traded from $903 to $912 a
metric ton, according to a survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with deals
yesterday from $928 to $933. Prices are 13 percent lower than at
the end of August.  Stockpiles of the fuel dropped 21 percent to 428,000 tons
in the week to yesterday as cargoes were shipped to  Benin ,
 Brazil ,  Mexico  and  Libya , according to data by PJK International
BV, a researcher based in the Netherlands. That’s the lowest
level since Nov. 14, 2003, Pieter Kulsen, founder of the
company, said by phone from Oosterhout.  Gasoline’s premium to Brent narrowed to $5.69 a barrel from
$6.29 yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude

$2.96 yesterday, according to PVM.  Middle Distillates  Diesel barges gained, trading twice at $41 a ton premium to
the October gasoil contract, according to a survey of brokers
and traders monitoring the Platts pricing window which ends at
4:30 p.m.  London  time. That compares with a deal yesterday at a
$36.50. Hetco, a unit of Hess Corp., bought from Mercuria Energy
Trading SA.  BP bought a jet fuel cargo from Morgan Stanley, part of
which was priced at a premium of $84 a ton to October gasoil,
according to the survey.  Total purchased a jet fuel barge at a premium of $83 a ton
to the gasoil contract, the survey showed. That compares with
barge trades yesterday at $80 and $83 more than gasoil.  Gasoil for October dropped 1.8 percent to $882.50 a ton as
of 5:09 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The November
contract fell 1.8 percent to $878.25 a ton. The low-sulfur grade
closed today at $891 a ton, without trading, according to ICE
data on Bloomberg. That compares with yesterday’s settlement of
$906.75 for delivery in January.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profitability,
narrowed to $15.06 a barrel from $15.47 yesterday, according to
ICE data. Front-month Brent declined 0.9 percent to $103.02 a
barrel on the ICE exchange.  A gasoil barge traded at a discount of $3 a ton to the
October gasoil futures contract, according to the survey of
Platts. That’s in line with yesterday.  Residues  Low-sulfur fuel oil fell, trading at $618 a ton versus $626
yesterday, according to the survey of Platts. High-sulfur grade
traded at $598 to $602 a ton compared with $600.25 to $608
yesterday.  Refineries  The fire at Shell’s refinery in  Asia  was extinguished late
yesterday. “We are progressively shutting down the refinery
over the next two days” as a precaution, not because of damage,
Martijn van Koten, vice-president for eastern manufacturing
operations, said yesterday at a press briefing. The Singapore
refinery can process 500,000 barrels of crude a day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
