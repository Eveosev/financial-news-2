Austria ’s 2012 economic slowdown
will be more abrupt than forecast and the Alpine republic’s
production of goods and services may shrink in a quarter next
year, a government-sponsored research group said today.  Austria’s 2012 gross domestic product, the value of all
goods and services, is expected to rise 0.8 percent, the Wifo
research institute said today in an e-mailed statement. It had
forecast the economy would expand by 1.8 percent in July. Wifo
initially saw 2 percent growth in April.  “The domestic economy at the turn of the year, in unison
with other EU countries, will stagnate,” Wifo said in the
statement. “A short-term decline in real GDP in a quarter
cannot be excluded.”  Wifo lowered anticipated 2011 growth to 2.9 percent from 3
percent. The forecasts didn’t consider the impact of a possible
Greek debt default on Austria’s economy, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
