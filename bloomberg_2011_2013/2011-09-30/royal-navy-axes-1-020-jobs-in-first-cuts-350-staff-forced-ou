The Royal Navy is trimming 1,020
jobs in its first round of cuts aimed at reducing Britain’s
defense budget.  A third of the personnel, 350 people, are being fired,
while the remainder applied to leave the service, the Ministry
of Defense said in a  statement  posted on its website today.  “To those of you who have been selected for redundancy, I
wish to take this opportunity to thank you for all you have
contributed to the service and to the nation’s security,”
Admiral Mark Stanhope said.  The plans to eliminate military posts were announced
earlier this year as part of defense cuts aimed at narrowing
Britain’s budget deficit. The program will see 11,000
redundancies across the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force by
April 2015.  The Royal Navy is seeking to cut its size to about 30,000
people, a reduction of 5,000. A third will be achieved by not
replacing people who leave, meaning as many as 3,250 will be
fired, the defense ministry said. About 920 soldiers and 930 RAF
personnel were told this month they were losing their jobs.  No one serving in  Afghanistan  or off the coast of  Libya 
will be forced out of their job “within a specified
timeframe,” the ministry said.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  says the defense cuts have
been made worse by the need to plug 38 billion pounds ($59
billion) of unfunded spending commitments inherited from the
previous Labour government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
