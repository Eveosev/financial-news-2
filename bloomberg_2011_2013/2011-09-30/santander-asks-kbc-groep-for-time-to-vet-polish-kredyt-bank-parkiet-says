Banco Santander SA (SAN)  of Spain has
asked for an extra two weeks from today to complete due
diligience on  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)  after making a preliminary offer to
the Polish lender’s owner,  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , Parkiet reported,
quoting a person familiar with the negotiations it didn’t name.  There is a “high probability” KBC will approve
