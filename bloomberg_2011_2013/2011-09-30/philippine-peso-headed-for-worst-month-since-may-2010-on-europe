The Philippine peso fell,
completing its worst month since May 2010, as  Europe ’s debt
crisis hurt demand for emerging-market assets and the central
bank signaled curbs against speculation.  The currency weakened in each of the past four weeks as
investors pulled a total $5.5 billion this month from equities
in the Philippines,  India ,  Indonesia ,  South Korea ,  Thailand  and
Taiwan, according to exchange data. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas
will likely raise the capital charge on non-deliverable peso
forwards and doesn’t favor “speculative” inflows, Governor
Amando Tetangco said at a government economic briefing in
Manila.  “It was risk-off mode for most of the month on
apprehension over Europe’s sovereign credit,” said Roland Avante, treasurer at Sterling Bank of  Asia  in Manila. “The
central bank’s move to temper speculative flows via NDFs also
contributed” to the peso’s weakness this month, he said.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 43.735 per dollar at the 4
p.m. close of trading in  Manila , taking the month’s loss to 3.3
percent, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched 43.95 on
Sept. 23, the weakest level since March 17. The currency, which
fell as much as 0.6 percent earlier today, declined 0.9 percent
since June in the first drop in five quarters.  About three-quarters of 1,031 investors, analysts and
traders said the euro-area economy will fall into recession
during the next 12 months, according to a Bloomberg quarterly
Global Poll published yesterday.  Temporary Volatility  Volatility in emerging markets is “temporary” and the
Philippines, along with the region, will attract more capital
“when the dust settles,” Tetangco said today. Local banks’
exposure to Europe declined to 1.4 percent of assets from a 2.9
percent ratio in January 2010, he said.  The monetary authority “has participated” in the foreign-
exchange market to curb volatility, the governor said. It has
solicited comments on a plan to impose a 187.5 percent market
risk weight on NDFs, according to a draft obtained by Bloomberg
News earlier this month.  The peso may rebound by the year-end to between 42.50 and
43, supported by remittances from abroad, Avante predicted,
lowering an earlier estimate for 42 to 42.50.  The yield on the 6.5 percent April 2021 bond rose 30 basis
points, or 0.30 percentage point, this month to 6.227 percent,
according to midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing &
Exchange Corp. The rate, which fell to a record 5.65 percent on
Sept. 14, declined five basis points today.  The  Philippines  has “fiscal space” to stimulate the
economy, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said in today’s
briefing. The government had a  budget surplus  of 9.22 billion
pesos ($210 million) in August, narrowing the eight-month
shortfall to 34.5 billion pesos, a report showed last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
