Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said last night that he would travel to Cuba in late October for
medical exams, hours after dismissing a newspaper report that
his health had deteriorated, state news agency  AVN reported .  Chavez, speaking by telephone on a state TV late night talk
show, said his condition was improving and that he was spending
time resting, reflecting and painting, AVN reported. The exams
will serve to “analyze the close of this cycle” of treatment,
said the president, who has an undisclosed form of cancer.  “Thanks to God, I’m enjoying better health each day,”
said Chavez, 57. “You have to turn bad things into good.”  Hours earlier, the self-declared socialist appeared live on
television with members of his Cabinet jogging and throwing a
baseball. The program was designed to dispel speculation over
his health after El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language sister
newspaper of the Miami Herald, reported that he was admitted to
hospital in Caracas Sept. 27 and would undergo dialysis to treat
a possible  kidney failure .  Chavez, who lost all his hair during treatment, was
operated on to remove what he has described as a “baseball-
sized” tumor from his pelvis on June 20 during a visit to Cuba
and has returned three times to the island nation for
chemotherapy treatment. The former paratrooper said yesterday
that he would not disclose the type of cancer he had because
doing so would feed “people’s morbid curiosity” about his
health.  To contact the reporter on this story:
