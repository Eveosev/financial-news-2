Slovak Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova  said the compromise she has offered to a coalition
partner to persuade it to back an overhaul of the bailout system
respects the July accord of European Union leaders.  “There will be no change” to the agreement on the
European Financial Stability Facility, the temporary aid fund,
she told journalists in Bratislava after meeting with EU leaders
including German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  in Warsaw earlier
today. Radicova declined to elaborate on details of the proposal
she submitted two days ago to the  Freedom and Solidarity  party,
which opposes rescues.  Radicova said she will continue negotiations with the head
of the party, Richard Sulik, this weekend. She said the
government still lacks a parliamentary majority to support the
package, which is designed to enhance the region’s rescue
mechanism to prevent the debt crisis from spreading.  Without Slovak approval, the key pillar of the EU’s defense
against the fiscal crisis wouldn’t be able to come into force.
Slovakia remains one of three countries that haven’t yet
ratified the overhaul. The Slovak vote will take place by Oct.
19, Radicova has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
