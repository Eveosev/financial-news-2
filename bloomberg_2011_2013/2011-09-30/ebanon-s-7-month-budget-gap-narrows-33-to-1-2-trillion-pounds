Lebanon’s budget deficit narrowed
about 33 percent in the first seven months of 2011 as
anticipated revenue from a telecommunications tariff increased.  The deficit narrowed to 1.2 trillion Lebanese pounds ($798
million) from 1.78 trillion pounds a year earlier, the Ministry
of Finance said today in an e-mailed statement from  Beirut .  The ministry included estimated revenue of 1.25 trillion
pounds from the Telecommunications Ministry in its calculations,
up from 331 billion pounds in the first seven months of 2010.
The money hasn’t yet been transferred to the Treasury.  To contact the reporters on this story:
