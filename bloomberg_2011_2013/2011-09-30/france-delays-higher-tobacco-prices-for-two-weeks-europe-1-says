France  will delay a 6 percent
increase in tobacco prices for two weeks because of a dispute
with a Belgian manufacturer, Europe 1 reported on its website,
without saying where it got the information.  The price hike will now come into force Oct. 17, rather
than Oct. 3 as originally planned, and the delay will cost the
government 15 million euros ($20 million) in lost revenue, the
radio station said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
