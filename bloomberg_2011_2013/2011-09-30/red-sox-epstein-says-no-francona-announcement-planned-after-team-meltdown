Boston  Red Sox General Manager Theo
Epstein said no announcement on the status of manager Terry
Francona is immediately planned.  Executives from the team, which surrendered a nine-game
lead for a playoff berth to the  Tampa Bay Rays  in September, met
with Francona today, a statement from Epstein said. The group
will take some time to consider what was discussed.  The team has the option to extend Francona’s contract for
next season and the season after. Francona has managed Boston
for eight years, winning two World Series before this season’s
record collapse.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
