Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) ,
Switzerland’s fifth-biggest wealth manager, said it may cut more
than 150 jobs unless the market picks up.  “There’s no hard timetable or target for cutting positions
-- it could be less than 150, it could be more,” spokesman Jan Vonder Muehll said today in a phone interview from Zurich.
“We’ve already trimmed a lot of the fat elsewhere, so the next
round will involve personnel cuts.”  Baer is embarking on a third round of cuts this year and
may cut staff in “growth markets” such as  Hong Kong  and
 Singapore  as well as in Switzerland, Vonder Muehll said. The
Zurich-based bank, which reported a 21 percent decline in first-
half profit in July, employs about 3,500 people.  The job cuts were reported earlier today by Neue Zuercher
Zeitung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
