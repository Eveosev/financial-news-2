Opap SA (OPAP) ,  Europe ’s biggest listed
gambling company, advanced as much as 4.5 percent in Athens
trading after it agreed pay the Greek government 935 million
euros ($1.3 billion) for an extension of its betting monopoly
and a video lottery terminal license.  The 10-year extension will cost 375 million euros,
according to an  Athens bourse  filing today. Opap will also pay
the state 5 percent of gross profit for the period through
through October 2030. The license to operate 35,000 terminals
will cost 560 million euros.  “Although slightly above previously suggested figures the
price-tags are positive for Opap, improving visibility and
crating value for the company,” Paris Mantzavras, an analyst at
HSBC Pantelakis Securities in Athens, said by telephone today.  Opap rose 4.1 percent to 7.86 euros at 1:57 p.m., advancing
for a fifth day. Opap declined 39 percent this year.  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said last week
he’ll raise 1.4 billion euros in September and meet a third-
quarter target of 1.7 billion euros next month, as the nation
struggles to meet goals set by the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  under the terms of a May 2010
bailout.  Greece  aims to raise 50 billion euros through 2015 to
help pay down debt.  Opap, of which the Greek state owns 34 percent, holds a
monopoly on sports betting in the country until 2020. The
company will pay 474 million euros of the total terminal license
value as soon as the final deal is signed and 86 million euros
over 24 months after the permit is issued, according to the
filing.  Under new gaming legislation Opap was granted the right to
a license to operate 35,000 video-lottery terminals, of which
18,500 have to be subcontracted. The bill came into effect Aug.
22.  A general meeting will be called soon to obtain shareholder
approval, according to the bourse filing. The Hellenic Republic
Asset Development Fund’s board needs to approve the deal, the
company added in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
