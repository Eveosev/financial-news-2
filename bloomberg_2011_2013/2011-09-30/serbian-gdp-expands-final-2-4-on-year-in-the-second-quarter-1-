Serbia ’s gross domestic product
expanded 2.4 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
final figures show, higher than the flash estimate of 2.2
percent for the period.  Mining and quarrying grew the most, by 17.5 percent, while
activity in the electricity and gas industries expanded  13
percent. Information and communications rose 9.9 percent and
construction expanded 7 percent, its second positive reading in
the past three quarters.  Agriculture activity was flat and the biggest decline of
4.6 percent was seen in the trade sector, the Belgrade-based
Statistics Office said.  The office also raised the first-quarter growth to 3.7
percent from 3.4 percent. Seasonally adjusted numbers, used to
compare activity with the previous quarter, showed the economy
contracting 0.1 percent.  The  International Monetary Fund  has lowered Serbia’s 2011
full-year economic growth to 2 percent from 3 percent, with GDP
expected to expand 3 percent in 2012, down from an originally
forecast 4.5 percent, due to the global economic slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
