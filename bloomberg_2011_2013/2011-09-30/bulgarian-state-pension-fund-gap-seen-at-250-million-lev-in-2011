Bulgaria’s National Insurance
Institute, the state-run pension fund, will have a deficit of
250 million lev at the end of the year, Finance Minister  Simeon
Djankov  said in the Sofia-based parliament today answering a
lawmaker’s querry. The deficit will be financed by revenue from
the customs service and not from the fiscal reserve, Djankov
said.  Bulgaria’s fiscal reserve was 5 billion lev at the end of
August, while the eight-month budget deficit narrowed to 1
percent of estimated economic output from 2.2 percent a year
ago, according to the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
