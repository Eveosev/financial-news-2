An alternative to the congressional
redistricting map approved by  Texas  Governor  Rick Perry  was
requested by federal judges seeking to avoid any delays in the
2012 elections.  The state’s new districts, created by Republican lawmakers
and approved by Perry, can’t be implemented until a federal
court in  Washington  or the U.S. Justice Department pre-clears
them, a process required of all states with a history of voting
violations.  The Obama Administration has opposed the maps, and the
Washington federal court won’t hear arguments in the matter
until Nov. 2, about six weeks before the candidate filing
deadline for Texas’s primaries.  “The court has an obligation to the public to consider
other available options so that the 2012 election process may
move forward,” U.S. District Judge Orlando L. Garcia said in an
order yesterday in the  San Antonio  court. He asked voting-rights
groups challenging the state’s maps to help the judges “prepare
a possible interim plan that may be implemented as a fair and
workable alternative.”  Hispanic voting-rights groups and lawmakers whose jobs were
threatened by the new maps sued Perry claiming the state’s new
districts will keep Latinos out of office. Texas gained four new
congressional seats after adding 4.3 million residents since
2000, more than 60 percent of whom are Hispanic.  The case is Perez v. Perry, 5:11-cv-0360, U.S. District
Court, Western District of Texas (San Antonio).  To contact the reporter on this story:
