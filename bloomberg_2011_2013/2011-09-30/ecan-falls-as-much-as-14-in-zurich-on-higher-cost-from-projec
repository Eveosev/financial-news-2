  Tecan Group AG (TECN) , a Swiss maker of
laboratory equipment, fell the most in seven years in Zurich
trading after saying a project to develop a diagnostics
instrument has been delayed, leading to higher costs.  Tecan slid 8.30 francs, or 12 percent, to 61.70 francs at
10:55 a.m. The stock declined as much as 14 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Sept. 23, 2004.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
