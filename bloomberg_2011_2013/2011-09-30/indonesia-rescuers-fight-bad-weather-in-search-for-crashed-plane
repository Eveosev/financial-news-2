Indonesian rescuers are fighting
bad weather and fog in North Sumatra’s jungles as they try to
reach a mountainside where an airplane with 18 people onboard
crashed yesterday.  Rescuers in a helicopter, who spotted the Casa 212-200
plane today, couldn’t land because of the bad weather, Herry Bakti Gumay, the transport ministry’s aviation head, said in a
phone interview from Jakarta. The nose of the aircraft appeared
to be damaged and the door was open, he said.  One of the passengers on the plane called a relative saying
all onboard were safe, the Jakarta Globe newspaper reported
today, citing a person it didn’t identify. Bambang Ervan, a
spokesman at the transport ministry, declined to comment on the
condition of the passengers as rescuers haven’t reached the
site.  The 18-seat plane, operated by  PT Nusantara Buana Air , was
headed to Kutacane in Aceh province from Medan in North Sumatra
when it crashed on Mount Bohorok. The site of the crash is about
100 kilometers (62 miles) from Medan, Ervan said today.  The aircraft, made by PT Dirgantara  Indonesia  in 1989, was
due to land at about 8 a.m. yesterday after a 37-minute flight.
The rescuers include workers from the planemaker and the
national transport safety committee, according to Gumay.  Indonesia suffered three fatal plane crashes this year,
based on Flight Safety Foundation  data . The country’s air-safety
operations fail to meet global standards, according to the U.S.
 Federal Aviation Administration .  To contact the reporter on this story:
