Indonesia ’s rupiah completed its
biggest monthly drop since 2009 after global funds reduced
holdings of the nation’s assets on concern the global economic
recovery is stalling. Bonds dropped.  The currency fell for a second month as exchange data
showed foreign funds sold $667 million more Indonesian shares
than they bought in September through yesterday. The
 International Monetary Fund  this month cut its 2011 growth
estimate for the global economy to 4 percent from 4.3 percent.
The rupiah rose for a fourth day today after Governor Darmin
Nasution said last week that  Bank Indonesia  would buy bonds and
intervene in the  currency market  “until the market cools.”  “The markets have reacted to  Europe ’s debt crisis,” said
Wiwig Santoso, head of treasury and markets at PT Bank DBS
Indonesia in Jakarta. “The central bank and the authorities are
prudent to the developments in the rupiah and investors are
comfortable with the presence of the central bank in the
market.”  The rupiah dropped 3 percent this month, the most since
February 2009, to 8,799 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in Jakarta,
according to prices from local banks complied by Bloomberg. It
fell 2.7 percent this quarter, the biggest decline since the
three months ended March 2009. The currency was little changed
from the end of last week.  Overseas holdings  of sovereign bonds dropped 11.7 percent
this month to 218.53 trillion rupiah ($24.8 billion) as of Sept.
29, according to the debt-management office.  The yield on Indonesian government’s benchmark 8.25 percent
bonds due July 2021 rose 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage
point, this month to 6.95 percent, according to prices from the
Inter-Dealer Market Association. The rate fell 61 basis points
this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
