Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Angolan unit
will increase oil production to about 500,000 barrels a day by
August or September next year, from 450,000 now, Expansao said,
citing country Managing Director Stephane de Mahieu.  The company, which operates the Block 15 project about 350
kilometers (218 miles) off the coast, is developing the Kizomba
satellite fields to extend the life of the area, Luanda-based
Expansao cited De Mahieu as saying. Output will decline in the
meantime as some fields near the end of their life, it said.  Exxon’s Angolan projects are pumping oil more than 95
percent of the time, De Mahieu told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
