Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa said “deteriorations” in advanced economies’ fiscal

process,” Shirakawa said, according to a transcript of a speech
in  Seoul  today. He also said that conditions are “not exactly
favorable” for the global economy as a whole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
