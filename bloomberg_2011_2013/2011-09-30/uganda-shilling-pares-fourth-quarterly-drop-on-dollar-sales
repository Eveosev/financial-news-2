Uganda ’s shilling strengthened
against the U.S. currency, paring a fourth quarter of declines,
as companies sold dollars to make local payments.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy
appreciated 0.4 percent to 2,845.15 per dollar at 2:36 p.m. in
the capital, Kampala, reducing its decline so far this quarter
to 9 percent.  “The gain is purely because people are short of shillings
and are now selling dollars to raise them,” Ahmed Kalule, the
head of  currency trading  at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd., said by
phone from Kampala.  Uganda’s shilling reached 2,897.50 on Sept. 23, the weakest
since June 1993, on concern Europe’s debt crisis will weaken
riskier assets further, increasing demand for dollars as a safe-
haven investment.  The currency has slipped 19 percent this year to the
dollar, making it the second-worst performer after  Kenya ’s
shilling. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a
more than 18-year high of 28.3 percent this month from 21.4
percent in August, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
