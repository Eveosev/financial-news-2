The  Federal Reserve  will purchase
$44 billion of longer-maturity Treasuries and sell the same
amount of shorter-term debt in October under its monetary
stimulus plan that’s become known as Operation Twist.  Purchases will begin Oct. 3 with the acquisition of $2.25
billion to $2.75 billion of Treasuries maturing between February
2036 and August 2041, according to a  statement  today from the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the branch of the  Federal
Reserve System  that implements monetary policy.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said last week that it
would replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio
with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to further reduce
borrowing costs and counter rising risks of a recession.
Treasury 30-year bonds extended gains after today’s
announcement.  “The most notable part of the Fed announcement is that
they are emphasizing the purchases first as evidenced by the
long bond purchases followed by 10-year debt purchases,” said
 Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group
LLC in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Yields on 30-year bonds fell 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 2.91 percent at 2:31 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.75 percent
securities due in August 2041 increased 3 2/32, or $30.63 per
$1,000 face amount, to 116 20/32.  Long-Bond Rally  After the Fed announced Operation Twist on Sept. 21, the
yields dropped 41 basis points last week in the biggest five-day
decrease in almost three years. Thirty-year yields have tumbled
140 basis points over the past three months, the biggest
quarterly reduction since the period ended December 2008.  The Fed will buy  Treasury securities  13 times a month and
sell its holdings of  U.S. government debt  six times, the New
York Fed said on Sept. 26. The Fed will sell $8 billion to $9
billion of nominal Treasuries five times a month per operation
and $1 billion to $1.5 billion of TIPS, in one operation. The
Fed will buy Treasuries 12 times a month and TIPS once a month.  The Fed also announced last week that it would switch the
reinvestment of its holdings of maturing housing debt to
mortgage-backed securities from Treasuries. The  New York Fed 
said this week it plans to buy $10 billion of agency mortgage-
backed securities between Oct. 3 and Oct. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
