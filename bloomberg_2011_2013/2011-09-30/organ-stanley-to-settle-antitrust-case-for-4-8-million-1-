Morgan Stanley (MS)  agreed to pay
$4.8 million to settle a U.S. antitrust case over a 2006
derivative contract with KeySpan Corp. that the Justice
Department said probably led to higher electricity prices in  New
York City .  The proposed settlement was filed today in federal court in
Manhattan, the Justice Department said in a statement. KeySpan
last year agreed to pay $12 million to settle.  Morgan Stanley entered into agreements with KeySpan and
Astoria Generating Co., KeySpan’s largest competitor in the
capacity market, that gave KeySpan a financial interest in
Astoria and ensured the company would withhold output from the
market and increase prices, the Justice Department said.  “Morgan Stanley is pleased to have settled this matter
with the  Department of Justice ,” Mary Claire Delaney, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, said in an e-mailed
statement.  KeySpan, based in Brooklyn,  New York , is a unit of London-
based National Grid Plc, owner of natural-gas and power networks
in Britain and the U.S.  The case is U.S. v. Morgan Stanley, 11-6875, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
