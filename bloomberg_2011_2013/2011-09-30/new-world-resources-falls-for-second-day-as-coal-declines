New World Resources Plc fell for a
second day in Prague and headed for a two-year low in  London 
trading as  Europe ’s benchmark coal futures contracts declined.  The Czech Republic’s biggest coking-coal producer slid 1.9
percent to 132.5 koruna by 12:06 p.m. in Prague, paring this
week’s gains to 4.3 percent. The stock has lost 21 percent this
month and 46 percent since the end of June. In London, NWR fell
3.2 percent to 453 pence today.  Coal for next-year delivery dropped 1.1 percent to $122.75
a metric ton in the Netherlands, heading for a fifth week of
declines. European stocks and U.S. index futures retreated as
reports showing contractions in Chinese manufacturing and German
retail sales signaled global growth is slowing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
