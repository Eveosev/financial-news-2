SATS Ltd. (SATS) , an airline services
provider at Singapore Changi airport, said today it is in talks
over the potential sale of Daniels Group, the owner of British
food brands including New Covent Garden Food Company.  “Discussions are presently at a stage where there is no
certainty that a definitive agreement may be arrived at and no
transaction may materialise from these discussions,” the
company said today in a statement to the Singapore stock
exchange. If the sale does not proceed the Daniels Group will
remain part of SATS, according to the statement.  HSBC Holdings Plc has been appointed to run the auction for
about 150 million pounds ($234 million),  Sky News  said today on
its website.  To contact the reporter for this story:
