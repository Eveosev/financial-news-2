nickel producer, jumped 4.2 percent to 1,500 rupiah, the

Indonesia’s investment coordinating board said yesterday the

factories and 1.1 trillion rupiah to build a new plant in North
Sumatra province.  “We positively view company’s capacity expansion plan as
it suggests greater economies of scale,” Merlissa Trisno, a
Jakarta-based analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, wrote in a
note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
