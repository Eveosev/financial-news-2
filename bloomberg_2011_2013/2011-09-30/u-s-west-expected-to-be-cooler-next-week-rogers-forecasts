Temperatures across the U.S. West
are expected to be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 Celsius)
cooler than normal next week, said  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The Midwest will reach highs in the 70s, with the 80s
possible in Texas from Oct. 5 to Oct. 9, according to Rogers’s
6- to 10-day outlook. The normal average temperature in Chicago
for yesterday was 59 degrees, while in  San Francisco  it was 63,
according to the  National Weather Service .  “The incoming trough into the West next week is very
impressive with widespread precipitation and much cooler
temperatures,” Rogers wrote in a note to clients.  The eastern U.S. is expected to warm 3 to 5 degrees above
normal from Oct. 10 to Oct. 14, according to Rogers’s 10- to 15-
day outlook. The Pacific Northwest may be cooler, while the
central U.S. is forecast to have seasonal weather.  The average temperature for  New York  yesterday was 63,
according to the weather service.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
