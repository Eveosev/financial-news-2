Thailand’s baht had its biggest
monthly drop in a decade after global funds reduced holdings of
the nation’s assets on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will sap
demand for Asian exports.  International investors sold $612 million more Thai
equities and $61 million more government debt than they bought
this month through yesterday, according to data from the stock
exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association. The baht touched
a one-year low yesterday after the  finance ministry  cut this
week its economic growth forecast for 2011 to as much as 4.3
percent from a June estimate of 5 percent.  “ Asia ’s currencies are under pressure because of fund
outflows as investors have been risk averse due mainly to the
European debt crisis,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “Concern about the local
economy is also growing as exports are likely to slow. Sentiment
may not recover anytime soon.”  The baht slumped 3.8 percent in September, the most since
March 2001, to 31.13 per dollar as of 3:04 p.m. in Bangkok,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency, which
gained 0.1 percent today, is 1.3 percent lower this quarter. It
may trade between 31.05 and 31.35 next week, Hasegawa said.  The Southeast Asian nation had current-account deficit for
the first time in three months in August, the Bank of  Thailand 
said in a statement today. The shortfall was $697 million,
compared with a revised $3.44 billion surplus in July. The
current account is the broadest measure of trade, tracking
goods, services and investment income.  Government bonds  declined this month. The yield on the 5.25
percent notes due May 2014 rose 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 3.52 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate, which fell three basis points today,
dropped 21 basis points during the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
