Indian stocks dropped, completing
their worst quarter since 2008, as  Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  slid after
the cabinet approved a bill making companies mining coal and
other minerals pay for development of areas where they operate.  Coal India, the world’s biggest producer of the fuel, lost
5 percent, a six-month low. Coal miners must share 26 percent of
their earnings, and other miners must pay an amount equal to the
royalty collected by the government for mineral extraction,
according to the bill.  State Bank of India (SBIN)  Ltd., the largest
lender, dropped for a third day, losing 2.1 percent.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, slid 1.5 percent
to 16,453.76 at the 3.30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The measure has
lost 13 percent of its value in the quarter ending today, the
most since the three months ended December 2008, on concern the
 Reserve Bank  of  India ’s record monetary tightening will slow
economic growth and erode company earnings.  “There will be a slowdown and economic growth would be
closer to 7.5 percent, compared with 8.5-to-9 percent which
people were talking about at the beginning of the year,” K.
Ramanathan, chief investment officer with Mumbai-based ING
Investment Management Pvt., said in a Bloomberg UTV interview.  Food prices accelerated for the first time in four weeks,
the trade ministry said yesterday, maintaining pressure on the
RBI to boost rates further. Food has a weighting of 14 percent
in the wholesale-price index, India’s benchmark price gauge.  The wholesale-price inflation reached a 13-month high of
9.78 percent in August, staying above 9 percent for a ninth
month, prompting the RBI to raise rates on Sept. 16 for a 12th
time since March 2010. The next policy meeting is due Oct. 25.  India’s economy  grew 7.7 percent last quarter from a year
earlier, the slowest pace since 2009, according to a Aug. 30
government report.  Earnings Concerns  The Sensex has fallen 20 percent this year on concern the
increases in borrowing costs and slowing global expansion will
erode company profits. Earnings for 47 percent of the companies
on the gauge missed analyst estimates in the June quarter, up
from 33 percent that lagged behind forecasts in the previous
three-month period, according to Bloomberg data.  “Consensus earnings estimates have been brought down from
22 percent in the beginning of the year to 14-to-15 percent,”
ING’s Ramanathan said.  Infosys Ltd. will announce results on Oct. 12, the first
company in the Nifty index to post earnings for the September
quarter. The stock fell 0.7 percent to 2,533.05 rupees, ending a
four-day rally.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. fell 1.4 percent to 4,943.25. The BSE 200-Index lost
1.3 percent to 2,028.27.  Mining Bill  Coal India plunged 5 percent to 333.2 rupees, the lowest
close since March 11.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the biggest producer of
the alloy, lost 4.2 percent to 415.4 rupees, the lowest level in
more than two years. Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the
biggest copper producer, slid 4.1 percent to 113.7 rupees, the
lowest in 28 months.  The new mining bill, which will replace laws drafted more
than five decades ago, aims to win support for industry from
local people who have received little or no benefit from the
mining of resources. Their exclusion has made many remote Indian
villages a rich recruiting ground for Maoist rebels.  The country could lose $80 billion of investment in
developing mineral deposits should the government fail to stop
rebel violence, London-based Execution Noble  Ltd. has said.  State Bank  lost 2.1 percent to 1,911.05 rupees.  ICICI Bank
Ltd. (ICICIBC)  declined 1.7 percent to 875.4 rupees while  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) 
slid 0.6 percent to 467.65 rupees.  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB)  dropped 4.8
percent to 1,018.9 rupees after the lender offered home loans at
a fixed interest rate of 11.75 percent for a 20-year period.  ‘Asset Quality’  The BSE India Bankex Index comprising 14 lenders has lost
23 percent of its value in the past year on concern banks may
report an increase in bad loans amid a slowdown in the economy.
Companies on the gauge trade at 12.3 times estimated earnings,
with 10 percent of the lowest level since May 2009.  “We continue to be underweight state-run banks, although
valuations are pretty cheap,” ING’s Ramanathan said. “There
are issues on the horizon in terms of asset quality and pension
liability, which could crop up in the next few quarters. We are
cautious on banks which have a larger exposure to infrastructure
and power sectors.”  The BSE India Power Index and the BSE India Capital Goods
Index have each plunged 30 percent this year as the government
took fewer policy decisions after a minister, bureaucrats and
company officials were jailed over corruption charges, delaying
awarding of new infrastructure projects.  Phone-Permit Probe  Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) , the flagship company of
billionaire  Anil Ambani , plummeted to a record 71.75 rupees
after investigators widened a mobile phone-license probe. Group
company  Reliance Capital Ltd. (RCAPT)  plunged 12.4 percent to 315.2
rupees, the lowest in 30 months.  India’s rupee lost 6 percent in September, its sharpest
monthly fall in three years, as Asian currencies slumped on
concern the global economy is headed for a recession, dimming
the outlook for exports and prompting investors to favor safer
bets than emerging-market assets.  Overseas funds bought a net 2.52 billion rupees ($51.5
million) of local equities on Sept. 28, reducing the outflow
from equities this year to 2.92 billion rupees, according to
data on the  website  of the market regulator. They withdrew a net
$2.4 billion in August, the most since October 2008.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fourth-biggest,
is influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
