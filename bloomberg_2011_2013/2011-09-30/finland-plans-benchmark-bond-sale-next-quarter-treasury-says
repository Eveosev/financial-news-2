Finland  is planning to sell more of
its existing euro benchmark bonds next quarter as demand for AAA
rated securities grows.  “The active investor interest in Finnish government debt
outside the euro currency has continued,” the Helsinki-based
Treasury said in an e-mailed statement today.  Finland, which didn’t specify the bond it plans to auction,
said it will give out further details on the bond auction a week
beforehand. The Treasury has completed 91 percent of the
estimated long-term borrowing this year.  Investors are snapping up Finland’s bonds as they flee
 Europe ’s debt crisis in search of safer assets. Finland, which
boasts the lowest credit default swaps in the euro area, has the
second-narrowest yield spread on 10-year debt to German bunds
after the Netherlands.  The northernmost euro member is funding its third
consecutive budget shortfall with borrowing. The government
plans 1.1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of spending cuts and the
same amount in tax increases next year to plug the deficit.
Finland’s gross borrowing in 2011 is estimated at 25.1 billion
euros, the Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
