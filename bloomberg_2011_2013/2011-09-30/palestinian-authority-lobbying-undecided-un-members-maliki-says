The  Palestinian Authority  is
lobbying undecided members of the United Nations  Security
Council  to back its bid for full UN membership, Palestinian
Foreign Minister Riad Maliki said.  The Palestinians aren’t satisfied with the eight votes they
have secured so far, Maliki said yesterday in Ramallah at a news
conference, segments of which were aired by Al Arabiya
television. Nine votes in the 15-member council are needed to
approve membership. The U.S. has said it will veto any Security
Council vote on Palestinian statehood.  Maliki said the Palestinians are in contact with Bosnia,
Colombia and  Portugal  to persuade them to back their bid, the
London-based Telegraph newspaper reported. Maliki will visit
Bosnia, while PA President  Mahmoud Abbas  will travel to Colombia
and Portugal, it said.  Abbas presented his case for recognition of Palestine as
the UN’s 194th member state at the General Assembly on Sept. 23.
It is due to be discussed by an admissions committee of the
Security Council tomorrow, the start of a process that could
take weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
