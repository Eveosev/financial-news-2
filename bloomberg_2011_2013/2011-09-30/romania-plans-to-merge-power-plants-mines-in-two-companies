Romania plans to merge  power plants 
and mines, scrapping an initial plan to form two larger
holdings, after unions and a minority shareholder opposed
merging unprofitable assets with money-making enterprises.  The Economy Ministry wants to merge three power plants and
mines under one entity called Oltenia SA and two thermal power
plants and coal mines under a second company called Hunedoara
SA, according to  a law draft  on the ministry’s website today.  Romania scrapped a plan to merge its hydropower and hard
coal holdings into one company called Hidroenergetica SA and
coal-fired and hydropower plants and two nuclear reactors under
a second holding called Electra SA, after unions and Fondul
Proprietatea SA sued the government to block it.  “ Romania  needs to form integrated companies, which will
have enough market share to become regional leaders in a
competitive market to successfully ensure safety and network
access for energy consumers,” the ministry said.  The  International Monetary Fund  and the European gave
Romania a combined 5 billion-euro ($6.7 billion) precautionary
agreement over the next two years and urged it to improve the
way the state-owned companies are run. They also want private
management to help cut the budget gap below 3 percent of gross
domestic product by next year from 6.5 percent of GDP in 2010.  The government also plans to “sometimes next year” sell
10 percent stakes in its hydro-power generator Hidroelectrica SA
and in Nuclearelectrica SA atomic-power company, which were both
included in the initial merger plan, through initial public
offerings, Victor Cazana, an  economy ministry  official, said on
July 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
