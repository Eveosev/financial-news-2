Russia-focused funds had their
second-biggest weekly outflow in two years, UralSib Financial
Corp. said, citing EPFR Global Data.  The funds saw net outflows of $443 million in the week
ending Sept. 28, the 12th consecutive week of declines, UralSib
said.  Russia’s benchmark Micex Index has plunged 16 percent this
quarter on concern the European debt crisis and a slowdown in
the  U.S. economy  will hurt global growth and damp demand for
oil, the country’s key export earner. The 30-stock gauge slid
0.8 percent today to 1,396.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
