India ’s budget deficit in the five
months through August was 66.3 percent of the fiscal-year goal,
as slowing growth adds to the challenge of narrowing the gap.  The deficit was 2.73 trillion rupees ($56 billion) from
April through August, the Controller General of Accounts said on
its  website  today. The fiscal year runs to March 31, 2012. The
shortfall was 39.7 percent of the annual target in the same
period a year earlier.  The  Reserve Bank  of India, fighting the fastest inflation
among major economies, has blamed the deficit for contributing
to price pressures. The shortfall will widen to 5.6 percent of
gross domestic product this fiscal year, exceeding Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee’s objective of 4.6 percent, according
to Religare Capital Markets Ltd.  “Higher  government spending , along with slippages in
revenue collections due to slowing economic growth, will make it
impossible to meet the fiscal-deficit target,” Jay Shankar, the
Mumbai-based chief economist at Religare, said before the
release. The administration needs to curtail expenditure and
“join hands” with the central bank to damp inflation, he said.  India’s federal government increased its debt-sale target
yesterday for the second half of the financial year by about 32
percent. The yield on the 7.8 percent government debt due April
2021 rose 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, yesterday to
8.44 percent, a two-month high. The bond markets are shut today.  India’s inflation has exceeded 9 percent for nine straight
months, defying 12 interest-rate increases since mid-March 2010
even as higher borrowing costs crimp  consumer spending  and
contribute to a slowdown in economic expansion.  The central bank raised the repurchase rate to 8.25 percent
on Sept. 16, breaking ranks with emerging-market counterparts
from  Brazil  to  China , which either cut borrowing costs or kept
them unchanged in recent weeks as the global economy weakens.  India’s $1.7 trillion GDP rose 7.7 percent in the three
months through June from a year earlier, the slowest pace since
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
