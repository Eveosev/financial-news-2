Suzano Energia Renovavel, a unit of
Brazilian paper and pulp company  Suzano Papel e Celulose SA (SUZB5) ,
will invest about 1 billion reais ($534 million) in new forests
and pellet plants in the northeast to tap rising demand for
biomass fuel in Europe.  The company will build two plants with total production
capacity of 2 million tons of pellets a year in the state of
Maranhao by 2014, Andre Dorf, president of Suzano Energia
Renovavel, said today in a telephone interview.  Utilities in the European Union are consuming more biomass
fuel to meet a directive requiring that 20 percent of member
countries’ energy comes from renewable sources by 2020, Dorf
said. The European market for pellets may expand to as much as
100 million tons a year, from 9 million tons now, he said.  “With the incentives  Europe  has in place, it makes
business sense for power generators to run on renewables,” he
said. “The price of pellets has risen recently,” to about 130
euros ($174) a ton.  Suzano, based in  Salvador , will be able to sign long-term
supply agreements with European utilities because it owns its
own forests, he said.  “You can’t do that if you’re buying on the market because
you can’t guarantee supply or quality of product,” he said.  Suzano said in July 2010 it would invest $800 million in
five pellet plants and energy forests by 2020. Three of those
facilities will be built by 2014 and two will be built in 2018
and 2019, respectively, Dorf said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
