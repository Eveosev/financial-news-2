Zambia’s budget speech will
probably be delayed from next month after the change of
government in last week’s election, said Given Lubinda, the
information minister.  A budget can, by law, be postponed to as much as three
months after an election, Lubinda said by phone today from
Lusaka, the capital. It should be presented by Dec. 20, he said.  Michael Sata  defeated incumbent president, Rupiah Banda, in
a Sept. 20 vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
