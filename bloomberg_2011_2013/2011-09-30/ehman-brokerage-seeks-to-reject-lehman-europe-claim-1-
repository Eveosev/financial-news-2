The trustee of  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ’s defunct brokerage said a so-called house claim
filed by Lehman Brothers International ( Europe ) should be
rejected because the affiliate isn’t a customer of the
brokerage, according to a statement by the trustee.  The Lehman affiliate is seeking $8.9 billion from the
brokerage, according to a court filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
