Slovakiaâ€™s coalition and opposition
lawmakers reached an agreement on a draft constitutional bill
that would limit the state debt,  Sme  reported, citing Ondrej
Matej, deputy for the ruling SDKU party.  The legislation, which shall be discussed in parliament by
the end of the year, will trigger automatic sanctions once state
debt exceeds a ceiling, the newspaper said. The debt limit will
gradually fall from 60 percent of gross domestic product to 50
percent of GDP, Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
