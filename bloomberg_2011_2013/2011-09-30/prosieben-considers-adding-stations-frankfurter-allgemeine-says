ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM)  is
considering buying stations in the  Middle East  and Asia as part
of its growth strategy,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Thomas Ebeling.  The television broadcaster is also considering a new
station in Germany targeted at viewers older than 40, the
newspaper reported. ProSieben is sticking to its targets for
this year, as it sees no signs of an economic slowdown from its
advertisers, FAZ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
