U.S. Gulf crude premiums
stengthened after the discount for West Texas Intermediate
versus Brent widened the first time in six days.  The gap between WTI and Brent November contracts increased
$1.63 to $23.44 a barrel in  New York . The spread settled Sept. 6
at a record margin of $26.87.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 65 cents to
$25.90 a barrel at 1:50 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 90
cents to $25.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added $1 to $22 a barrel while Poseidon strengthened 65
cents to $21.50 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened 50 cents to $20.50
a barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 85
cents a barrel below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium increased 50
cents to $25.25 above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $7.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$10.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
