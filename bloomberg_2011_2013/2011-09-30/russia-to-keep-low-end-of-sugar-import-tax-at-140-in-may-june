Russia plans to keep the minimum
level of the sugar import duty at $140 a metric ton in May
through July of 2012 on record beet crop, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said today in an e-mailed statement.  The ministry estimates the beet harvest will reach 36
million tons this year and sugar output from domestic crops will
climb to about 5 million tons. The countryâ€™s worst drought in at
least half a century shriveled crops last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
