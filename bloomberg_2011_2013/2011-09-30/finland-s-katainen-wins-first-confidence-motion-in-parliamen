Finland ’s Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  won his administration’s first confidence vote after
the opposition used the motion to try to block municipal reform.  Lawmakers voted 108 to 66 to back the cabinet. None
abstained and 25 were absent. The opposition Center Party filed
the motion on Sept. 16, protesting the government’s plans to
merge municipalities. Katainen’s six-party coalition had
proposed the measure in an effort to shore up public finances as
Finland adapts its budget to  Europe ’s fastest-aging population.  No confidence motions  in Finland are a commonly used tool
in parliament to try to block government policies. Opposition
parties proposed 13 motions to overturn the previous government
during the last parliamentary term from 2007 to 2011.  “Municipal reform is necessary to save the welfare
society,” the Minister for Local Government, Henna Virkkunen,
told lawmakers on Sept. 28. “It’s important to speed up the
change.”  Finland’s budget will be in deficit for a third consecutive
year after an 8.2 percent economic slump in 2009 depleted  tax
revenue  and swelled spending on benefits. Finland’s government
wants to  merge municipalities  by 2015 to create larger, more
efficient units.  The Nordic country has 320 municipalities, of which one
fifth are net payers and 80 percent receive government funding
to operate basic social services, such as health care and
schools, according to the Association of Finnish Local and
Regional Authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
