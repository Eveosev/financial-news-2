Brazil ’s central bank cut its
forecast for the 2011  budget deficit  to 2.4 percent of gross
domestic product, from an earlier forecast of 2.5 percent, the
head of the bank’s economic research department Tulio Maciel
told reporters in Brasilia.  Brazil’s net debt will end the year at 38.5 percent of GDP,
from an earlier forecast of 39 percent, Maciel said. The net
debt to GDP ratio will fall to 37.6 percent in September, from
39.2 percent in August, partly helped by a weaker real, which
increases the value of Brazil’s dollar assets in local currency,
Maciel added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
