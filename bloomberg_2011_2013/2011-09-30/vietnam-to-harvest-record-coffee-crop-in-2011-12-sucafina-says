Coffee production in  Vietnam , the
world’s grower of the robusta variety, will have a record crop
in the season starting Oct. 1, according to Sucafina
SA, a green coffee trader based in Geneva,  Switzerland .  Output will be in excess 1.25 million metric tons (20.8
million 60-kilograms bags) in the 2011-12 season, up from 1.2
million tons in the current crop year, Nicolas Tamari, managing
director at Sucafina, said in an interview in Geneva today. The
company has offices in Vietnam, according to its  website .  “We are going to have an exceptional crop in Vietnam and
this is mainly due to the high prices,” Tamari said. “There
has been good husbandry and ideal weather.”  Robusta coffee prices have risen 14 percent over the past
year on speculation demand would outpace supply with a smaller
2011-12 crop in  Indonesia , the third-largest producer.  Brazil  is
the second-biggest robusta producer.  Coffee production in Indonesia dropped to 7.9 million bags
in 2011-12, from 9.3 million bags in the previous crop year,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. While the 2011-12
season starts in October in Vietnam, harvesting in Indonesia
began in April, the USDA said.  “Knowing that there is a constant growth in consumption,
it’s a very good thing to have bumper crops,” Tamari said. “In
the past, we were concerned about bumper crops because the price
would decline. But today bumper crops are more a security to
make sure the pipeline of coffee is filled with stocks.”  Coffee production in  Colombia , the world’s second-largest
producer of the arabica variety, will be stable at about 9
million bags, he said.  “I don’t believe the recovery will be as fast as we would
hope,” Tamari said.  Colombian growers usually harvest the main crop from
October to December, while the secondary mid-crop, or mitaca, is
collected from April to June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
