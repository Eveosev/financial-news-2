Terry Francona is likely to leave
as manager of the Boston  Red Sox  following the team’s late-
season collapse, Fox Sports reported on its website, citing
people in  Major League Baseball  it didn’t identify.  Francona will meet with Boston management today and while
his departure is not certain, it is the likely outcome because
he is pressing for a resolution, Fox Sports said. He would not
be fired, rather the Red Sox would decline their options on him
for 2012 and 2013, Fox Sports said.  Boston led Tampa Bay by nine games for the American League
wild-card playoff spot on Sept. 4 before finishing 7-20.
Francona, 52, led the Red Sox to World Series titles in 2004 and
2007 and into the postseason five times in his eight seasons
with the team.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
