Kenyan bonds fell for a third day,
raising yields on the 2016 notes to the highest in at least four
months as inflation quickened for the 11th month and the economy
contracted for the first time in six quarters.  Yields on the 7.636 percent debt increased three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 13.83 percent by 2:26 p.m.
in Nairobi, the highest since May 24, when Bloomberg started
compiling the data. The shilling erased an earlier drop, adding
0.2 percent to 99.55 per dollar, taking its decline this quarter
to 10.3 percent, the worst since the three months through
September 2008, when it weakened 10.8 percent.  Kenya ’s inflation rate rose to 17.3 percent this month as
the cost of food and oil surged, the statistics agency said
yesterday. The economy contracted a seasonally adjusted 4.6
percent in the second-quarter, as poor rainfall hurt farm
output, it said.  “With inflation going up, for investors to get a rate of
return on bonds it makes sense the yield has to go up,” Benson
Kinuthia, a fixed-income dealer at Genghis Capital Ltd., said by
phone.  The shilling has lost 19 percent this year against the
dollar, making it the worst-performing currency worldwide,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Price growth has
exceeded the government’s 5 percent target all year, as Kenya
feels the effects of the worst regional drought in 60 years,
which has cut agricultural production and forced the country to
boost food imports, including sugar, whose retail price has more
than doubled this year.  Rate Meeting  Kenya’s monetary policy committee will next meet on Oct. 5,
three weeks after it raised the key lending rate by three-
quarters of a percentage point to 7 percent, its steepest rise
since the rate was introduced in June 2006 to combat inflation.  Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  has formed a team of government
officials and industry leaders to examine ways to stabilize the
shilling that will report its recommendations next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
