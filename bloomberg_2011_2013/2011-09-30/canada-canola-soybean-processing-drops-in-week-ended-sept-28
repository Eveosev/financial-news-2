Canadian mills processed 8.5
percent less canola and 29 percent fewer soybeans in the week

said.  Mills crushed 120,713 metric tons of canola, also called
rapeseed, and 17,849 tons of soybeans, the Winnipeg, Manitoba-
based Canadian Oilseed Processors Association said today in an
e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
