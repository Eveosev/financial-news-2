Nigeria ’s stocks gauge fell,
heading for the worst quarter in almost three years as concern
that global growth will slow curbed demand for riskier assets.  The 198-member Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index
added 1.1 percent to 20,371.98 by 2:29 p.m. in Lagos, trimming
its decline this quarter to 18 percent, making it sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s second-worst performer in the three months, after
Kenya’s gauge, which fell 20 percent.  Ashaka Cement Plc (ASHAKACE) , a unit
of Lafarge SA, the biggest cement maker, climbed the limit of 5
percent, the most since Aug. 11, to 18.80 naira.  Emerging-market equity funds posted a ninth week of
outflows, with withdrawals almost doubling from the previous
period, as the  Federal Reserve ’s efforts to bolster the  U.S.
economy  disappointed investors, Citigroup Inc. said today.
Frontier-market stocks are headed for their worst quarterly
slump since the three months through June as the U.S. economy
faltered and the European sovereign-debt crisis spread.  “Nigeria is the most liquid of the other markets and it’s
logical that in the sell-down, Nigeria would be more hit than
the other markets,” Esili Eigbe, a Lagos-based analyst with
Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, said by phone today.  International investors account for as much as 70 percent
of daily volume on the Nigerian bourse, according to data from
the exchange. Nigeria’s naira depreciated to the weakest level
on record against the dollar in interbank trading today,
reaching 160.575, on mounting demand for foreign currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
