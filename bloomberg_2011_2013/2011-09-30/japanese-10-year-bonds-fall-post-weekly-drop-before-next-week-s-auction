Japan ’s bonds fell, posting the
biggest weekly slump in a month, before the Ministry of Finance
sells 2.2 trillion yen ($29 billion) of 10-year debt on Oct. 4.  Primary dealers, which are required to bid at government
auctions, often reduce holdings of bonds in case prices decline
before they can pass on the new securities to investors. The
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average closed little changed today and
completed a 1.6 percent gain this week, limiting demand for the
relative safety of government debt.  “There seems to be selling ahead of the auction next
week,” said Makoto Noji, a senior debt and currency strategist
at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo., one of the 25 primary
dealers. “Excessive pessimism has eased.”  The benchmark 10-year yield added two basis points to 1.02
percent as of 3:50 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.1 percent
security due September 2021 lost 0.182 yen to 100.723 yen.  The yields have risen four basis points over the past five
days, the biggest weekly advance since the period ended Aug. 26.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery declined 0.25
to 142.23 at the 3 p.m. close of the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
