Serbia banned all public gatherings
for the weekend, including a gay Pride Parade scheduled for Oct.
2,  B92 web portal said , adding the decision was made after a
meeting of the country’s National Security Council.  “The National Security Council assessed that security
would be extremely jeopardized,” the web portal said, adding
that “extremists were preparing big riots in many parts of
Belgrade” including attacks on ruling coalition party
headquarters, foreign companies and public garages.  More than 100 Serbian policemen and civilians were injured
and dozens more were arrested in skirmishes that broke out at
last year’s Pride Parade in Belgrade, the first public gay event
in nine years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
