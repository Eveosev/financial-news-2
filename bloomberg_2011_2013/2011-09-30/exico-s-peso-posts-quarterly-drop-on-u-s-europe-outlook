Mexico ’s peso posted its biggest
quarterly decline since 2008 on concern U.S. economic growth is
slowing and as Europe struggles to contain its sovereign debt
crisis.  The peso slid 1.4 percent to 13.8973 per  U.S. dollar  at
5:20 p.m.  New York  time, from 13.71 yesterday. It depreciated 16
percent since June 30, the second-worst performer among major
Latin American currencies after Brazil’s real. The peso fell 2.4
percent this week and 11.3 percent in September.  “The slow growth outlook in the U.S. and worldwide is a
downside risk to the Mexican economy and that tends to hit the
peso pretty hard,” said Aryam Vazquez, an emerging-markets
economist at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York. “Markets may also
be considering the possibility of the central bank cutting rates
this year and that makes the peso less attractive as well.”  The  Mexican peso  is the most liquid currency in the region
and, being deliverable, is easy to trade making it a popular
hedge for other emerging-market assets, said Flavia Cattan- Naslausky, a strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford,
Connecticut.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to
6.82 percent, according to data from Banco Santander SA. The
price of the security fell 0.95 centavo to 127.58 centavos per
peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
