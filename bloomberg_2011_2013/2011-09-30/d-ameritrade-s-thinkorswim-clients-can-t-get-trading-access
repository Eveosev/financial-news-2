Some clients at  TD Ameritrade
Holding Corp. (AMTD)  weren’t able to get into their Thinkorswim
accounts this morning.  “We encountered some issues just after market open this
morning that impacted some of our clients, particularly those on
our Thinkorswim downloadable trading platform,”  Kim Hillyer , a
spokeswoman for Omaha, Nebraska-based TD Ameritrade, said in an
e-mail. “We were able to implement a resolution mid-morning,
and clients were able to use all of the platform’s functionality
thereafter.”  Rick Arroyave, a 48-year-old trader in Dallas, said he
couldn’t log in to make a trade after the stock market opened. A
message was displayed on the website for users with a phone
number to call. He was able to access his account at about 10:50
a.m.  New York  time.  “It’s an absolute mess,” said Arroyave, who’s been using
Thinkorswim for about five years to trade stocks, options and
futures. “I’m going to have to look at alternatives because
this is not reliable.”  In 2009 TD Ameritrade bought options brokerage Thinkorswim
Group Inc. for $749 million to expand beyond equities. The
online broker transferred more than 250,000 Thinkorswim accounts
to the TD Ameritrade platform in August. Some clients
experienced issues with electronic trades in August following
the integration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
