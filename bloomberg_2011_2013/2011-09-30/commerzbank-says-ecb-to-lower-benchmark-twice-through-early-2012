Commerzbank AG said it now expects
the  European Central Bank  to lower its benchmark interest rate
in the fourth quarter of 2011 and in the first three months of
2012 as the euro-region economy slides into a recession.  Euro-region gross domestic product may stall in 2012, said
 Joerg Kraemer , an economist at the Frankfurt-based bank, in an
e-mailed note today. He had previously forecast an expansion of
0.8 percent. The ECB will probably lower its key rate to 1
percent over the coming months from a current 1.5 percent, as
the economy “will probably slip into a recession,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
