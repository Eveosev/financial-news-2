Airbus Military , a subsidiary of
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., said a C-212 transport
aircraft had an accident in the north Sumatran region of
 Indonesia . The company said it’s “premature” to speculate on
the cause of the incident.  The C-212, which seats 24 to 26 passengers, has been in
production for more than 30 years and is popular because it can
handle rugged terrain and needs limited servicing. Spanish
manufacturer Construcciones Aeronauticas SA, now part of
EADS, delivered more than 480 planes to 43 countries since the
first flight in 1971.  To contact the reporter on this story:
