Axis Communications AB (AXIS) , a Swedish
specialist in Internet-based cameras, forecasts growth in the
video-surveillance market will boost revenue as it adds clients,
co-founder Martin Gren said.  The market, which is valued at about $10 billion annually,
may grow 10 percent this year, Gren said. Analog cameras account
for about three-quarters of the market, with digital devices
making up the rest, he said. Sales of IP-based cameras will
outpace the market in coming years, Gren said, predicting a
shift to digital by 2020. Axis is the world’s biggest maker of
Internet-protocol cameras, he said.  “Looking at the trend in recent years, we hope to reach in
the range of 400 million euros ($540 million) in revenue this
year,” Gren said in an interview in Milan today. “This is the
only industry where analog still plays a dominant role, and
that’s pretty unique. That will change in coming years.”  The company had sales of about 3 billion kronor ($436
million) last year, indicating possible growth for this year of
more than 20 percent. Gren owns about 11 percent of Lund,
Sweden-based Axis, he said.  Axis shares rose 1.8 percent on an intraday basis in
Stockholm trading after Gren’s comments to close at 113.75
kronor.  Surveillance in cities and school districts, airports,
train stations and onboard transport as well as in retail and
banking will boost growth, Gren said. Axis devices include
 cameras  able to detect people through smoke and extreme weather
conditions as well as in low light.  To contact the reporter on this story:
