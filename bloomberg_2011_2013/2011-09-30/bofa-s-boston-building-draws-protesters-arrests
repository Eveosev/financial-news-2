Twenty-one people were arrested as
about 3,000 demonstrators converged on a  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
office building in downtown  Boston  yesterday, protesting the
largest U.S. lender’s foreclosure practices.  Some participants were taken into custody after entering
the building’s lobby and refusing to leave, said Boston Police
Commissioner Ed Davis. Those arrested were charged with
trespassing, according to Officer Eddy Chrispin, a police
spokesman.  The crowd had marched a half-mile from Boston Common to the
building at 100 Federal Street while chanting, banging on drums
and toting signs that read “Stop Corporate Greed” and “Bank
of America: Guilty as Charged.”  The rally was organized by Right to the City Alliance and
follows demonstrations in  Manhattan , known as #OccupyWallStreet,
which began 14 days ago to protest the influence of Wall Street
money on politics. A second Boston protest group, Occupy Boston,
held a rally at Dewey Square later, and from there protesters
from both events made their way to the statehouse, according to
Chrispin.  T.J. Crawford, a spokesman for Bank of America, called the
protests “aggressive public-relations stunts.”  “Bank of America has a lot to be proud of in
 Massachusetts , from modifying 18,000 mortgages since 2008 to
lending nearly $400 million in the first half of 2011 to small
businesses,” he said.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America is the
largest U.S. lender by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
