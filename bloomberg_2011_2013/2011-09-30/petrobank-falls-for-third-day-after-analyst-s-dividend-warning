Petrobank Energy & Resources Ltd. (PBG) 
fell for a third day after BMO Capital Markets cut its rating on
publicly traded affiliate  PetroBakken Energy Ltd. (PBN) , declaring its
dividend payout “increasingly unsustainable.”  Petrobank, based in Calgary, fell 24 cents, or 4 percent,
to C$6.35 at 4:06 p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange after
dropping C$2.74, or 31 percent, the previous three days.
PetroBakken rose 33 cents to C$6.75 after dropping from C$9.42
Sept. 27.  Petrobank owns 59 percent of PetroBakken, a Calgary-based
oil producer, and expects C$105 million annually in dividends at
the current per-share payout of 8 cents monthly, according to
Petrobank’s Aug. 15 earnings release.  The dividend rate “looks increasingly unsustainable”
because PetroBakken is poised to outspend  cash flow  by C$350
million,  Jim Byrne , a Calgary-based analyst for BMO Capital
Markets, said in a Sept. 27 note issued after markets closed,
cutting the firm’s rating on PetroBakken to “underperform”
from “market perform.”  “PetroBakken is paying a dividend that puts their debt at
dangerous levels,” Bryne said today in an e-mail responding to
a query by Bloomberg. “Petrobank owns about 60 percent of
PetroBakken, so the weakness is directly correlated.”  Byrne doesn’t rate Petrobank and doesn’t own stock of
PetroBakken.  To contact the reporter on this story:
