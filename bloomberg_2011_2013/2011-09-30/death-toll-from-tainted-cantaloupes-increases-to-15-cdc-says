The death toll from listeria linked
to contaminated cantaloupes has climbed to 15, while 84 people
have been sickened in the deadliest U.S. foodborne illness
outbreak in more than a decade, the  Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention  said.  The illnesses now span 19 states, the CDC said today in an
 update  on its website. The agency earlier  reported  that as of
Sept. 26, laboratory tests had confirmed that 72 people in 18
states had fallen ill from the tainted melons, and 13 died.  The listeria outbreak, the first ever tied to cantaloupe,
may sicken people through October because those who eat the
contaminated fruit can take more than two months to become sick,
CDC Director  Thomas Frieden  said Sept. 28 on a conference call.
Jensen Farms of Granada, Colorado, recalled the cantaloupes on
Sept. 14.  “Cantaloupes that are known to not have come from Jensen
Farms are safe to eat,” the CDC said in today’s update. “If
consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe for
purchase, they should ask the grocery store.”  Food and Drug Administration officials said Sept. 28 that
they working with  Colorado  officials to learn how the
contamination occurred.  Listeria, a bacterium often found in soil and water,
sickens about 1,600 people and kills about 260 in the U.S. each
year, according to the CDC website.  Animals  can carry the germ
without appearing ill. Pregnant women, the elderly and those
with weakened immune systems are at greatest risk from listeria
infections. Symptoms include fever and diarrhea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
