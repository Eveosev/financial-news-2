Barclays Plc (BARC)  was ordered to suspend
part of its  Japan  brokerage business for 10 days after breaching
Japanese securities rules, the country’s finance regulator said.  The  Financial Services Agency ’s suspension will take place
from Oct. 11 to Oct. 24, the regulator said in a statement. The
regulatory action affects the London-based company’s equity
trading in Japan between Barclays’ affiliated companies, the
agency said.  The violation took place after Barclays failed to report
short-sale transactions properly to the Osaka Securities
Exchange, the agency said in a statement to its website. The FSA
also ordered Barclays to submit a report to the regulator by
Oct. 21 detailing who is responsible for the violation and how
it will prevent another occurrence.  Barclays “will enhance further our compliance processes
and governance to prevent such an error from reoccurring,” the
brokerage said in a statement e-mailed to Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
