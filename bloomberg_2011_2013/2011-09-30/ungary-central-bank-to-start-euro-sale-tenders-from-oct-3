Hungary’s central bank will start
offering euros through tenders to provide liquidity to banks as
borrowers start repaying foreign-currency mortgages at below-
market interest rates.  The tenders will be held at least once a week from Oct. 3
through Feb. 29, 2012, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank said in a
statement posted on its  website  today.  Hungarian lawmakers last week approved a law allowing
borrowers early repayment of foreign-currency mortgages at fixed
exchange rates that are more than 20 percent below current
market rates. The European Union warned the plan may contravene
the bloc’s laws, while Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch
Ratings said it set a “dangerous precedent.”  Central bank Governor Andras Simor announced Sept. 20 that
the regulator will offer domestic lenders access to its reserves
as the early repayment of mortgages is likely boost demand for
foreign currencies, leading to a weaker forint.  Only banks with foreign-currency mortgages that can be
repaid under the government program will be allowed to take part
in the tenders, the bank said. About 20 percent of  Hungary ’s 18
billion euros ($24.6 billion) of foreign-currency mortgages are
likely to be repaid, Simor said last week.  Tender offers will be accepted in declining order, starting
with the highest euro-forint bid, the statement said. The bank
will publish the details of the tenders every month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
