Worker seizures of ministries and
public offices are blocking the completion of a quarterly review
of Greeceâ€™s performance in meeting the terms of a European
Union-led bailout, Kathimerini reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Inspectors from the EU,  International Monetary Fund  and
European Central Bank are supposed to complete the review by
Oct. 3, according to the Athens-based newspaper. They are having
problems gathering the necessary data due to impeded access to
the buildings, which include the  Finance Ministry  and the
Hellenic Statistical Authority, Kathimerini said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
