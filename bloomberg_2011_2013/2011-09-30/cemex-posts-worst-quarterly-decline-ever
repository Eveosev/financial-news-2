Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in the Americas, plunged a record 56 percent in the third
quarter on concern a global economic slowdown will crimp demand
for the company’s products.  Cemex slumped 6.3 percent today to 4.44 pesos in Mexico
City, a 12-year low, as of 4:15 p.m. New York time. The
quarterly decline was the stock’s worst performance since
Bloomberg records dating back to 1992.  Global stocks fell today, dragging the MSCI All-Country
World Index to its biggest quarterly loss since 2008, as
declines in Chinese manufacturing and German retail sales
signaled less demand for the construction materials the company
makes. Investors are also concerned the company won’t be able to
meet its debt obligations,  Carlos Hermosillo , head of equity
research at Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said today.  “The quarterly fall has been dramatic,” Hermosillo said
today in a telephone interview from Mexico City. “The company
hasn’t convinced investors that its outlook isn’t as bad as it
appears.”  Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Zambrano said yesterday the
Monterrey, Mexico-based company plans to sell about $1 billion
of assets by the end of 2012 to reduce debt. Cemex, which had
$17.8 billion in debt at the end of the second quarter, will
meet bank covenants for 2011 and 2012 without renegotiating or
selling equity, Zambrano said.  Cemex had obtained a $15 billion  bank loan  in August 2009
to avoid default after U.S. cement demand plummeted following
the company’s $14.2 billion acquisition of Rinker Group Ltd.,
which had more than 80 percent of sales in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
