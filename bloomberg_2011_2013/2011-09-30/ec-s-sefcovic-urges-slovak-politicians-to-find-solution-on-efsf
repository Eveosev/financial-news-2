Slovak politicians should find a
solution to pass legislation needed to allow the European Union
to initiate the European Financial Stability Facility, European
Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said.  The country is playing “dramatically” with its
credibility by threatening not to pass the legislation needed
for the EFSF to take effect, Sefcovic told reporters today in
Bratislava, Slovakia.  Sefcovic, a Slovak national, said he “can’t imagine” the
European Union renegotiating the EFSF terms for Slovakia in
order to help it win a vote in the country’s parliament in
Bratislava.  No new proposal from Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova  has been
received regarding Slovakia’s proposals on EFSF, the official
said, responding to news that the premier has a compromise plan
that may persuade a governing coalition partner to back EFSF.  The party, known as SaS, has said it will study Radicova’s
plan. It has previously threatened to reject the EFSF bill in
its present form when it comes up for a vote in parliament,
probably by Oct. 17.  All 17 euro-area nations must approve the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
