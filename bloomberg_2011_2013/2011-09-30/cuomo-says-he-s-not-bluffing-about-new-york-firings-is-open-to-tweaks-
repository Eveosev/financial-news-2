New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo  said
he wasn’t “bluffing” when he threatened to fire 3,500 members of
the state’s second-largest public union after the rank and file
rejected a contract he negotiated with their leaders.  “If they thought we were bluffing, we’re going ahead with
the layoffs, and it wasn’t a bluff,” Cuomo said today in a radio
interview on WCNY in Syracuse. He said he hopes the union holds
another vote on the contract, which freezes pay for three years,
increases worker health-care contributions and mandates unpaid
days off.  Cuomo also said he is “open to tweaks” to the contract
that are revenue-neutral and may allocate benefits differently
among workers.  Members of the Public Employees Federation, which
represents 56,000 professional, scientific and technical
employees, opposed the contract by a 19,629-to-16,906 vote, the
union said Sept. 27. The rejected accord was similar to one
approved in August by the 66,000-member Civil Service Employees
Association, the state’s biggest.  The contract rejection represented a defeat for Cuomo’s
effort to win unions’ acceptance of cost-cutting measures under
the threat of dismissals. Cuomo, 53, gave the unions the choice
as part of his fiscal 2012 budget, which includes $450 million
in labor-cost savings and no new taxes.  PEF’s leadership approved the contract 2-1 after months of
negotiations, Cuomo said. It marked the first time in the
union’s 34-year history that the rank and file rejected a pact
recommended by its leadership, the union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
