Intl. FCStone Inc. was approved for
category 2 membership, associate broker clearing, of the London
Metal Exchange, the exchange said in a notice to members.  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel, the Russian steelmaker, and
and Metalliance LLP have been approved as category 5 members,
according to separate notices e-mailed today. That boosted LME
membership to 94 and category 2 membership to 27, Miriam Heywood, an LME spokeswoman, said.  Category 2 members have all the privileges of ring dealing
members except that they may not trade in the ring.Â Category 5
members have no trading rights except as clients, according to
the LME website.  The LME said in a separate notice it listed Port Klang,
 Malaysia , as a delivery location for tin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
