 Agro Invest Ukraina TOV, part of
Serbia-based  MK Group d.o.o.  opened a 113,000 metric-ton silo in
Ukraine where it plans to expand grain production.  The $20 million silo in Jagotin, 120 kilometers (75 miles)
east of Kiev, was developed with support from the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, MK Group said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The diversified group composed of agribusiness, sugar
refining, trade, tourism, information technology and property
management, said the silo is part of its broader, $60 million
investment in agriculture production in Ukraine that began in
2006. It said it needs new silos as it plans to expand grain
production to 100,000 hectares (247,100 acres) from 40,000
hectares at present.  To contact the reporter on this story:
