Refining profits from gasoil rose
the most in 17 weeks in  Asia , while losses from processing crude
into fuel oil shrank for a fourth week after Royal Dutch Shell
Plc shut refinery units at its  Singapore  plant Sept. 28 because
of a fire. The refiner bought gasoline on the Platts ‘window.’  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude oil rose $1.91, or 12
percent, to $18.30 a barrel this week, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. This crack
spread, a measure of refining profit, increased the most since
the week ended June 3.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, known as the regrade, fell 5
cents to $1.70 a barrel, according to PVM.  Shell said yesterday that it has extinguished a fire that
had raged for two days at its largest  oil refinery  and that it’s
shutting processing units at the Singapore plant as a precaution.  Light Distillates  Shell purchased 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline from BP
Plc at $119.60 a barrel on the Platts trading ‘window’ in
Singapore today, according to traders monitoring transactions on
the pricing system.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $120.33 a metric ton at 6 p.m. Singapore time from $119.81 at
the end of Asian trading on Sept. 23, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude shrank $1.43, or 35
percent, to $2.72 a barrel this week, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd. The gap has narrowed for a fourth week, the
longest weekly rally since April.  The premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke
grade dropped to $7 a ton from $8.25 a week earlier, as the
price of utility-grade fuel oil fell more than shipping fuel.
This viscosity spread has narrowed for a fourth week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
