(Corrects official price and daily settlement in the
second paragraph, the contract dates in the third paragraph and
the swaps date in the seventh paragraph of story from Sept. 30.)  Oman crude’s official selling price
for November rose 1.8 percent after refiners’ demand increased
as they prepared to produce more heating fuels ahead of winter.  Oman exports will cost $106.96 a barrel, compared with
$105.10 for October cargoes, based on the average of daily
futures settlement prices on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange 
calculated by Bloomberg News. Today’s settlement at 12:30 p.m.
Dubai time was $105.60 a barrel, the exchange said in an e-mail.  Open interest in the November Oman futures was 10,531
contracts as of 4:29 p.m. Singapore time, the equivalent of
about 10.5 million barrels of crude, or 21 cargoes of 500,000
barrels each, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
down from the 13,826 contracts for the October contract.  Refiners in Northeast Asia boosted their purchases of
Middle East crudes to raise their supplies of heating fuels such
as kerosene and gasoil before the Northern Hemisphere winter.
The surge in buying pushed premiums for grades such as Qatar
Marine to 95 cents a barrel, the most since October 2007.  Oman crude for immediate loading decreased 93 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $101.50 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in November fell 0.9 percent to $101.20. Murban
dropped 0.9 percent to $105.51.  Oman futures for December delivery hadn’t traded from
yesterday’s close of $100.93 a barrel.  The November Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
widened 23 cents to $4.78 a barrel, according to data from PVM.
The exchange for swaps for December gained 5 cents to $3.76.  To contact the reporter on this story:
