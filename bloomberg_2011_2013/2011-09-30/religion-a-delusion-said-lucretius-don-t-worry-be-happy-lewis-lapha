An Italian with a passion rode
through southern  Germany  in the winter of 1417. His destination
was a remote monastery likely to have a library full of
neglected manuscripts. On this journey, Poggio Bracciolini
dusted off an epic that changed the world.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Lost for nearly 1,000 years, “On the Nature of Things,”
by Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius, was composed in praise
of earthly pleasure.  Positing a universe of particles moving in an infinite
void, Lucretius declares that organized religions are cruel
superstitions, scoffs at the idea of an afterlife with
punishments and rewards, and notes that delusion is the greatest
enemy of human happiness.  Rediscovered, the radical ideas of Lucretius influenced
figures ranging from Giordano Bruno, who was burned at the stake
by a threatened Christian church, to Leonardo, Galileo, Darwin
and Einstein.  I spoke with Harvard professor Stephen Greenblatt, author
of “The Swerve: How the World Became Modern,” on the following
topics:  1. Ruins of Antiquity  2. Atoms and Emptiness  3. Freedom and Creation  4. Threat to the Church  5. The Pursuit of Happiness  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
