Meg Whitman  has ended her part-time
role as strategic adviser at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as
she takes over the top job at  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)   Whitman, 55, joined the venture capital firm in March to
coach companies in its portfolio. The former EBay Inc. chief
executive officer was named CEO of Hewlett-Packard last week.  “Meg Whitman provided great value to our partnership and
our entrepreneurs,” Ted Schlein, a partner at Menlo Park,
California-based Kleiner Perkins, said in an e-mailed statement.
“We wish her the best of luck as CEO of HP.”  Her departure was previously reported by VentureWire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
