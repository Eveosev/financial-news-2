Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  may lower its
target for achieving a record 10 billion euros ($13.6 billion)
in profit this year,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing unidentified
people close to the management board.  Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  is due to provide
an assessment of the current market situation on Oct. 4 at a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference in London, the
newspaper said.  Deutsche Bank said earlier that the goal is only achievable
under normal market conditions, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
