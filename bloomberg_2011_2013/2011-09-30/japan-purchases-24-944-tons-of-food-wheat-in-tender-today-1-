Japan  bought 24,944 metric tons of
food wheat and 32,588 tons of food barley today through a tender
system introduced to loosen government grain-import controls,
according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries.  Of the total wheat bought, 16,580 tons were from  Canada ,
8,300 tons were from  Australia  and the reminder was from  France ,
Masafumi Otsuka at the ministryâ€™s grain-trade division said by
phone. Of the total barley, 22,500 tons were from Australia and
the rest was from Canada.  The tender was held under the so-called simultaneous buy-
and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
