Yasuhiro Sato, chief executive
officer of  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , said Japanese companies
are interested in developing operations and finding partners in
Vietnam to diversify away from China.  Sato spoke to reporters in Hanoi today after his bank said
it would buy a 15 percent stake in Joint-Stock Commercial Bank
for  Foreign Trade  of Vietnam.  “Some important Japanese companies now are trying to have
operations overseas more because of yen appreciation and the
tsunami.  Vietnam’s economy “has expanded quite a lot” and
“business activities are now booming.”  Japanese companies are considering Vietnam as a “very
important country” to “have significant operations.”  “Some companies who are leading in technology or
automobile industry and some other areas have strong desires to
have operations overseas.  “Our non-Japanese clients in the U.S. and European
countries are now seeking very good partners in Vietnam.  “Now in  China , we have more than 30 Japanese companies.
They have too much focus on China so far and they are now
looking for the next area to make investment -- and Vietnam is
the strongest possibility for Japanese companies.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
