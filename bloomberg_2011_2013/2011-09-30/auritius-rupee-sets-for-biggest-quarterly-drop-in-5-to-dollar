Mauritius’s rupee headed for its
largest quarterly drop in five against the dollar, as the debt
crisis in  Europe , the nation’s main market, raised concern about
a global slowdown and curbed demand for riskier assets.  The currency declined as much as 0.7 percent to 29.2 per
dollar and was little changed at 29.0 by 1:05 p.m., in Port
Louis, the capital, taking its quarterly loss to 3.5 percent,
the most since the three months through June 30 last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the euro, the
rupee appreciated 0.8 percent to 39.2087.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  gained support from
lawmakers to expand the European Financial Stability Facility’s
firepower, raising the nation’s guarantees to 211 billion euros
from 123 billion euros.  “The German vote to increase the size of their rescue fund
did cheer up markets as it showed renewed commitment from the
European union’s economic leadership to support ailing
economies,” analysts at Mauritius Commercial Bank, the
country’s largest lender by market value, wrote in an e-mailed
research note today. “It remains highly unlikely that markets
will be duped by this move as it does nothing to tackle the real
issues facing the euro zone.”  Mauritius derives 41 percent of its foreign-currency
earnings in euros, as Europe is the main source for tourism
arrivals and largest buyer of the nation’s manufactured goods,
data from Bank of Mauritius and Statistics Mauritius show. The
Indian Ocean Island nation, with a population of 1.3 million
people, is a net importer of food and fuels. The data agency has
cut growth to 4.1 percent for 2011 from 4.5 percent in June, it
said in a statement on its website.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 28.0918 to 28.2632
and the selling price increased to 29.5889 compared with 29.5948
yesterday, according to  exchange rates  published today on the
Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
