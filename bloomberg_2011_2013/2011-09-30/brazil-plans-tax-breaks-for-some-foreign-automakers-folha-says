Foreign carmakers that set up
factories in Brazil will receive tax breaks under new rules that
increase the industrial-production duty to prevent a surge in
vehicle imports, Folha de S. Paulo reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  The companies will pay less than the 30 percentage-point
tax increase on the so-called IPI tax, and in exchange will be
required to gradually increase the share of locally produced
parts to 65 percent, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  Government officials are negotiating with  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , the newspaper said,
citing unidentified presidential aides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
