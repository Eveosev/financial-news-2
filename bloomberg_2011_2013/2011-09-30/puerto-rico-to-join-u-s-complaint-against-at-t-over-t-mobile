The U.S.  Justice Department  amended
its lawsuit seeking to block AT&T Inc.’s $39 billion takeover of
T-Mobile USA Inc., allowing  Puerto Rico  to join the case.  The government filed its amended complaint in federal court
in  Washington  today. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is the
eighth jurisdiction to sign on to the government’s Aug. 31
complaint, following seven states that joined Sept. 17.  The government’s antitrust suit claims that the merger,
which would make Dallas-based AT&T the biggest wireless carrier
in the U.S. and cut the number of national competitors to three
from four, is anticompetitive and will hurt consumers.  “It is not unusual for state attorneys general to
participate in DOJ merger review proceedings or court filings,”
Michael Balmoris, an AT&T spokesman, said in an e-mail. “At the
same time, we appreciate that multiple state attorneys general
and hundreds of other local, state and federal officials are
publicly supportive of our merger.”  AT&T continues to work on “parallel paths -- seeking a
solution that addresses the DOJ’s concerns while simultaneously
preparing for trial,” Balmoris said. The company remains
“confident” it will “reach a successful solution,” he said.  The case is U.S. v.  AT&T Inc. (T) , 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
