German  government bonds  pared their
gains after a report showed European inflation quickened to the
fastest in almost three years in September.  The German 10-year bond yield was two basis points lower at
1.98 percent as of 10:06 a.m. in  London , after being as low as
1.94 percent.  The euro-area inflation rate jumped to 3 percent this month
from 2.5 percent in August, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today in an initial estimate. That’s
the biggest annual increase since October 2008. Economists had
projected inflation to hold at 2.5 percent, according to the
median of 38 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
