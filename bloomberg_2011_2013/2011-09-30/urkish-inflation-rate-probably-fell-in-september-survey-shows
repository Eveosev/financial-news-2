Turkish inflation probably slowed
in September as food prices moderated, an effect the central
bank says will prove temporary.  The rate may fall to 6 percent from 6.7 percent in August,
according to the median estimate of six economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Forecasts ranged from 6.2 percent to 5.8
percent. The statistics agency in Ankara will release the data
at 10 a.m. local time Oct. 3.  Inflation is likely to pick up again after September and
accelerate toward the end of the year, central bank Governor
Erdem Basci said today. The lira currency fell 29 percent
against the dollar in the year to September, driving up the
price of imported goods and fuel.  Even if the main rate does fall, “we expect  core inflation 
may deteriorate visibly,” Nilufer Sezgin, an economist for
Ekspres Invest in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed report. “Food
prices can be very volatile.”  The cost of groceries jumped 4.7 percent in the month in
September last year, when prices overall rose 1.2 percent. The
rate of core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices,
rose to 6.2 percent in August from 3.2 percent in January.  Consumer-price growth may accelerate to 8.5 percent by the
end of this year, compared with an official target of 5.5
percent, the  International Monetary Fund  said Sept. 22. There’s
“a high chance” that the bank will meet its 2012 goal of 5
percent, Basci said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
