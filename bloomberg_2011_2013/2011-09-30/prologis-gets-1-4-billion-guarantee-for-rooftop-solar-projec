ProLogis (PLD)  Inc., the world’s biggest
warehouse owner, received a partial U.S. Energy Department
guarantee backing a $1.4 billion loan to put solar panels on
about 750 buildings.  Project Amp, when complete, will have total capacity of as
much as 752 megawatts from rooftop photovoltaic panels on
buildings owned by San Francisco-based ProLogis, the agency said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and NRG Energy Inc. are both
investing in the project.  Lawmakers in Washington are scrutinizing the Energy
Department’s program in the wake of Solyndra LLC’s Sept. 6
bankruptcy filing. The Fremont, California-based solar-panel
maker received a $535 million loan guarantee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
