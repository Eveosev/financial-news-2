Oil may fall next week on concern
that  Europe ’s economy is showing increasing signs of a slowdown
as governments struggle to contain the fiscal crisis and avert a
Greek default, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area fell to 95 from a revised 98.4 in August, the
European Commission in Brussels said yesterday. That’s the
lowest since December 2009. In  Germany , Europe’s largest
economy, business sentiment decreased for a third month in
September and investor confidence dropped to the lowest level in
more than two and a half years.  Thirteen of 28 analysts, or 46 percent, forecast oil will
decline through Oct. 7, while eight respondents, or 29 percent,
predicted prices will increase. Seven estimated there will be
little change. Last week, 55 percent of the surveyed analysts
projected a drop.  “It will be another down week for oil, as sentiment
worsens over the prospects of a looming recession,”  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund that focuses on energy, said in an e-mail.  Total products supplied, averaged over four weeks, fell 0.6
percent to 19 million barrels a day in the period to Sept. 23,
the fifth straight weekly decline, according to a U.S. Energy
Department report on Sept. 28.  Crude oil for November delivery rose has climbed $2.74, or
3.4 percent, to $82.59 a barrel this week on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures have fallen 10 percent this year.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
