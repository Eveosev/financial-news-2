European stocks fell, extending the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s largest quarterly decline since 2008,
as reports on Chinese manufacturing and German retail sales
added to concern the economy is slowing.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  lost 6.8 percent as Handelsblatt reported
that Germany’s biggest lender may lower its profit target.  Metro
AG (MEO)  slid 4.3 percent after German retail sales declined the most
in more than four years in August. Royal Philips Electronics NV
tumbled 4.1 percent as HSBC Holdings Plc cut its earnings
estimates for the company.  The Stoxx 600 fell 1.2 percent to 226.18 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London. The measure has rallied 4.6 percent this week
as policy makers increased efforts to contain the region’s debt
crisis and U.S. jobs and growth data exceeded forecasts. The
gauge still posted the biggest quarterly decline since 2008,
having plunged 17 percent since the end of June. The index
dropped 4.7 percent in September, a fifth month of losses.  “The situation is quite dark right now,” said Philipp Musil, who helps manage about $11 billion at Semper Constantia
Privatbank AG in Vienna. “We’re very cautious about equities.
All in all the figures are not good and many investors think
we’re going straight into a recession.”  National benchmark indexes retreated in every western
European market, except Iceland.  Germany ’s DAX Index slid 2.4
percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index dropped 1.3 percent and
 France ’s CAC 40 fell 1.5 percent.  Chinese Economy  In  China , the reading of 49.9 for the September purchasing
managers’ index, released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics today, was unchanged from August and compared with a
preliminary 49.4 figure published last week. The gauge was below
50, the level that separates expansion from contraction, for
eight months through March 2009.  European inflation unexpectedly accelerated to the fastest
in almost three years in September, complicating the  European
Central Bank ’s task as it fights the region’s worsening
sovereign-debt crisis. The euro-area inflation rate jumped to 3
percent from 2.5 percent in August, the European Union’s
statistics office said. That’s the biggest annual increase in
consumer prices since October 2008.  Deutsche Bank slid 6.8 percent to 26.32 euros. The bank may
lower its target for achieving a record 10 billion euros ($13.6
billion) in profit this year, Handelsblatt reported, citing
unidentified people close to the management board.  Christian Streckert, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment on “market speculation,” when reached by Bloomberg.  French Banks  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, France’s biggest
banks, fell 3.5 percent to 30.05 euros and 5.1 percent to 20
euros, respectively. UBS AG downgraded Societe Generale to
“neutral” from “buy” and cut its price forecast on the stock
to 21 euros from 35 euros, while reducing its price estimate on
BNP to 31 euros from 36 euros.  Metro, Germany’s largest retailer, dropped 4.3 percent to
31.93 euros. German retail sales, adjusted for inflation and
seasonal swings, slumped 2.9 from July, when they rose 0.3
percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today.
Economists had forecast a 0.5 percent decline, according to the
median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Philips slumped 4.1 percent to 13.55 euros in Amsterdam
trading after HSBC cut its earnings estimates by 20 percent to
30 percent for the next two years and predicted “many
challenges” for the Dutch electronics company.  “Philips’ figures could certainly be better and generally
more and more earnings are being revised down,” said Markus Huber, head of German sales trading at ETX Capital in  London .
“I wouldn’t be surprised if the company cut its forecast.
Consumers might scale back in the short term because of the
prevailing uncertainty.”  Luxuries Drop  Luxury-goods stocks declined as the gauge of Chinese
manufacturing indicated a contraction. Swatch AG slid 7 percent
to 302.30 francs. The world’s largest watchmaker makes 33
percent of its revenue in greater China, according to Bloomberg
data.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) , the U.K.’s largest luxury-goods maker,
lost 2.3 percent to 1,174 pence. The company makes 33 percent of
its revenue in the Asia Pacific region, Bloomberg data shows.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s
biggest makers of luxury cars, led declines in European
automakers as the industry posted the worst performance of all
19 groups in the Stoxx 600. BMW slid 5.3 percent to 49.97 euros
while Daimler fell 3.4 percent to 33.63 euros. Daimler sells 10
percent of its vehicles in China, Bloomberg data show.  Lundin Petroleum AB (LUPE)  surged 32 percent to 117.60 kronor in
 Stockholm , the biggest gain on record, after increasing its
estimate of recoverable resources for the North Sea Avaldsnes
oil prospect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
