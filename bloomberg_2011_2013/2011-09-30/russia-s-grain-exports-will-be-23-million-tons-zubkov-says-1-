Russia’s grain exports will be 23
million metric tons this season, making it the second biggest
wheat exporter after the U.S., Viktor Zubkov, the first deputy
prime minister, said.  The exports reached 9.1 million tons so far this year with
shipments to 66 countries, Zubkov said, according to a statement
e-mailed by the government. Russia’s wheat exports will be 16
million tons for the season started July 1, making it the fourth
largest shipper after the U.S., Australia and  Canada , the
International Grains Council estimated this month.  Russia will spend 1.3 billion rubles ($42 million) on rail
discounts to boost grain exports from Siberia, signaling more
shipments through the  Black Sea , the main export hub. Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  will consider domestic cereal needs
before signing the discounts into law, according to an e-mailed
statement from his press service.  Siberia’s grain crop is 12.5 million tons so far this
year, with the Far Eastern soybeans crop at 1 million tons, 
Zubkov said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
