Philippine stocks advanced, with
the benchmark index bound for the biggest gain in  Asia , after
the government said economic growth will accelerate and the
central bank said it has “flexibility” to support expansion.  Banco de Oro Unibank Inc. (BDO) , the nation’s biggest bank by
assets, climbed to a seven-week high after raising money to
boost capital.  DMCI Holdings Inc. (DMC) , the country’s biggest
construction company, led gains in infrastructure-related stocks
after government said it will provide 22.5 billion pesos ($513
million) in funding for infrastructure projects.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose for a third day,
jumping 3.2 percent to 3,999.65 at the noon close in Manila. The
measure lost 6.8 percent this quarter, the worst since the three
months ended December 2008. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped
0.9 percent as of 12:24 p.m. Singapore time.  “The government’s pronouncement is a good reminder there’s
no fundamental problem with the  Philippines ,” said  Jonathan
Ravelas , chief market strategist at Manila-based Banco de Oro
Unibank.  The Philippine stock measure sank to 3,721.22 on Sept. 26,
the lowest close since Sept. 2, 2010, following a five-day sell-
off triggered by speculation  Greece ’s debt problem will spread
and slow the global economy.  Accelerating Growth  Second-half growth in the Philippines will accelerate from
the first six months of 2011, Economic Planning Secretary
Cayetano Paderanga said today in a briefing to investors.
Central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said the nation’s monetary
policy is “flexible” and will support growth, while keeping
inflation within the target of 3 percent to 5 percent.  Inflation in the $200 billion economy cooled to 4.7 percent
in August, the slowest pace in four months, government data
show.  Banco de Oro increased 4.3 percent to 51 pesos, the biggest
gain since Aug. 10. The bank said it sold 6.5 billion pesos of
so-called lower tier-2 bonds, more than double its original 3
billion-peso target.  DMCI advanced 1.2 percent to 34.70 pesos. The government
infrastructure fund will be “on top of” money allocated for 10
projects earlier this year, Budget Secretary Butch Abad said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
