Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE) , the
U.K.’s second-largest supplier of gas to homes, said second-half
earnings will compensate for “significantly” lower profit in
the prior six months, allowing annual goals to be met.  Adjusted profit before tax for the six months ending today
will decline from the same periods in both 2009 and 2010, the
Perth, Scotland-based company said in a statement today.  Rising costs to use energy distribution networks, as well
as wholesale and environmental-program charges have added to
energy prices, Scottish & Southern said in July, prompting it to
raise its rates for the first time in almost three years.  “This year has been characterised by volatile wholesale
energy markets and rapidly changing retail markets,” Chief
Executive Officer Ian Marchant said in the statement.  Scottish & Southern, which will go by the name of SSE Plc
from Oct. 1, plans to spend 1.7 billion pounds ($2.65 billion)
in fiscal 2012. The company completed construction of its 350-
megawatt Clyde South onshore wind farm earlier than expected. In
addition, 115 of the planned 140 turbines have been installed at
the Greater Gabbard offshore wind development, it said.  Power generation at the company’s Glendoe hydroelectric
plant in  Scotland  should resume in the first half of 2012, the
utility said. The 100-megawatt plant was halted after a rock-
fall in August 2009 partially blocked a tunnel that carries
water to turn a turbine and generate power at the site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
