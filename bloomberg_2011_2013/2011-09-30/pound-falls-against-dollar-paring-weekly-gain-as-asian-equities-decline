U.K. 10-year gilts rose the most in
three weeks as a decline in stocks around the world spurred
demand for the perceived safety of government debt.  The securities gained for a second day as reports showed
Chinese manufacturing shrank, German retail sales slumped, and
U.S. consumer spending slowed. The pound rose against all its
major counterparts after a research group said U.K. consumer
sentiment increased this month. Sterling has gained 3.5 percent
this quarter, the third best performer after the yen and dollar
among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  “Gilts are moving higher as equities weaken,” said
 Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “It’s a risk-off day,
reversing much of what we’ve seen over the past week. Gilts are
moving on the back of equities, rather than anything
fundamental.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt fell 10 basis points to 2.43
percent at 4:46 p.m. in London, after dropping as much as 13
basis points, the most since Sept. 5. The 3.75 percent security
due in September 2021 rose 0.930, or 9.30 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,564) face amount, to 111.585. The two-year rate was little
changed at 0.57 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares dropped 1.2 percent
and the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  declined 1.3 percent.  Gilts gained as the Federal Statistics Office said German
retail sales fell 2.9 percent last month. HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics said their Chinese purchasing managers’ index
was unchanged at 49.9 in September, a third month it has stayed
below 50 which indicates a contraction. Growth in U.S. consumer
spending slowed to 0.2 percent in August from 0.7 percent in
July, the Commerce Department said.  Quarterly Return  Gilts have returned 8.1 percent this quarter, more than the
7.2 percent increase in German bunds and 6 percent gain from
U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Bank of England policy makers have indicated they are
becoming more concerned the economic recovery will cool further
and most of them said this month they see expanding stimulus as
“increasingly probable.”  Gilts rose yesterday amid speculation the  Bank of England 
will increase its 200-billion pound bond purchase plan as soon
as next month. The central bank reports its next interest-rate
and bond-buying decisions on Oct. 6.  The pound snapped a two-day decline versus the euro after
GfK NOP Ltd. said its index of consumer sentiment gained 1 point
from August to minus 30. A measure of households’ expectations
for the economy over the coming 12 months climbed 4 points to
minus 27, the London-based research group said.  GfK said while the increase is not statistically
significant, it is “psychologically important” as it halts a
recent decline in sentiment.  The U.K. currency strengthened 1.1 percent to 86.08 pence
per euro, and gained 0.3 percent to 120.38 yen. Sterling was
little changed at $1.5632, erasing a drop of 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
