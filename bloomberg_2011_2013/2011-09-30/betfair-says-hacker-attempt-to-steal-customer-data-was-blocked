Betfair Group Plc (BET) , the world’s
biggest person-to-person online betting exchange, said it
suffered an attempt to steal data 18 months ago and was able to
recover the information without harm to customers.  Betfair said its security measures made the information
unusable for fraud.  “We contacted all the relevant authorities and worked
closely with them regarding this matter and it was established
that there was no risk to customers,” the company said today in
an e-mailed statement. “We have subsequently implemented all of
the recommendations from the independent reports we commissioned
and have done everything we can to minimize the risk of this
happening again.”  The  Daily Telegraph  said today that criminals, believed to
be from  Cambodia , stole payment details from Betfair of almost
2.3 million customers on March 14, 2010, in an incident that
wasn’t detected until a computer server malfunctioned in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
