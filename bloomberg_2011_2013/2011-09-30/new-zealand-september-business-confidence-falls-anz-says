New Zealand ’s business confidence
fell to a five-month low in September amid concerns that the
European debt crisis may trigger a global slowdown, according to
a survey by ANZ National Bank Ltd.  A net 30.3 percent of companies expect the economy to
improve over the next 12 months, down from 34.4 percent in
August, according to the survey released in Wellington today.
The net figure, which subtracts the number of pessimists from
the number of optimists, was the lowest since April.  Business expectations for profits and future investment
fell for a second month as companies sense sovereign-debt woes
in  Europe  pose a threat to global growth and demand for New
Zealand’s shipments abroad, which make up 30 percent of gross
domestic product.  “Shifts in mood and expectations need to be watched, for
such shifts can quickly accelerate,” ANZ National Bank Chief
Economist Cameron Bagrie said in a statement. Still, the move
doesn’t “portend of a massive swing in the key levers
businesses can and sometimes do pull when conditions change,”
he said.  A second measure of expectations for companies’ sales and
earnings declined to 35.4 percent, compared with 43.3 percent
last month, pointing to annual growth of 4.5 percent by early
2012, Bagrie said.  The survey of 474 companies showed more hiring plans and
increased export intentions, ANZ said. Fewer expect to raise
prices, and estimates for the annual inflation rate in one year
fell to 3.23 percent from 3.45 percent in August, which was the
highest level since November 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
