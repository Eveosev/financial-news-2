Canada will pay C$2.2 billion to
 Quebec  to compensate the province for harmonizing its sales tax
with the provincial rate, Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said.  Harper made the announcement at a news conference today in
Quebec City.  Quebec adopted a value-added sales tax in the early 1990s
that blends provincial and federal sales taxes. Quebec lobbied
for compensation after the federal government gave financial
support to Ontario and British Columbia to harmonize their sales
taxes last year.  British Columbia voters opted to rescind the harmonized tax
in a referendum whose results were released Aug. 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
