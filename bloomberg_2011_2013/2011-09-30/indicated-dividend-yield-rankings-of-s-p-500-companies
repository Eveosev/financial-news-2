The table below ranks indicated dividend yields
of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index as of today. The yield
is calculated by taking the latest declared dividend, annualized and divided
by the stock price. Payout ratios are calculated based on the latest quarterly
dividend paid divided by earnings.   The average yield is 2.61 percent.  Frontier Communications Corp (FTR)  offers the
highest yield at 12.08 percent while  Precision Castparts Corp (PCP)  provides the
lowest at 0.08 percent.  The data is sorted by indicated dividend yield in descending order.
Dividends are paid on a quarterly basis unless noted.
