DoubleLine Capital LP decided
earlier this year that betting against French government debt
was the best way to capitalize on risks that the euro-area
sovereign-debt crisis would spread beyond  Greece .  The firm made the wager in the summer by purchasing credit-
default swaps on French debt. The cost of protecting the
nation’s bonds against non-payment for five years was 177 basis
points today, up from 137 in mid August.  “That has been hugely profitable,” said  Jeffrey Gundlach ,
chief executive officer of the Los Angeles-based firm, whose
$11.6 billion Total Return Bond Fund beat 99 percent of its
peers in the past year handing investors a gain of 10.6 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  French financial companies had $672 billion in public and
private debt in Greece, Portugal, Ireland,  Italy  and  Spain  at
the end of March, the largest combined holding of the bonds of
the euro-area’s troubled countries, according to the Basel,
Switzerland-based  Bank for International Settlements .  We realized “a crisis in  Europe  is going to stem from
Southern European debt -- and the biggest holder of that is the
French banks,” Jeffrey Sherman, a portfolio manager who
helps oversee DoubleLine Capital’s $17 billion in assets, said
in a telephone interview yesterday.  A basis point on a swap protecting 10 million euros ($13.6
million) of debt from default for five years is equivalent to
1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
