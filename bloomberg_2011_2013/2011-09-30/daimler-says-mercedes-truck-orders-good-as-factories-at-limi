Daimler AG, the world’s largest
maker of heavy-duty vehicles, said demand for Mercedes-Benz
trucks hasn’t shown signs of an impact from a slowing economy.  “In spite of the debt crisis, we have good reason to be
optimistic,” Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche said in a
speech at the company’s truck factory in Woerth,  Germany , where
production of the revamped Actros model started today.  Mercedes-Benz truck plants will be working at full capacity
through the end of this year and have a “good level” of orders
for the first quarter, he said, adding that demand for the long-
haul Actros 40-ton hauler, which cost more than 2 billion euros
($2.7 billion) to develop and prepare factories, was
“encouraging.”  Zetsche reiterated the company’s goal of gaining market
share as it targets sales of 500,000 trucks by 2013, 41 percent
more than the 355,000 vehicles sold last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
