“ Europe  is probably going to fall
into recession in the fourth quarter,” said  Holger Schmieding ,
chief economist at Joh. Berenberg Gossler & Co. in  London .  “Leading indicators are pointing to a modest recession,”
and the  European Central Bank  “will probably go to a softer
stance soon,” Schmieding said in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with Ken Prewitt and  Tom Keene .  To contact the reporter on this story:
