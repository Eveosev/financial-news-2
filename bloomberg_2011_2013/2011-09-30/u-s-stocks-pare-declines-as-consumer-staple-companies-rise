U.S. stocks pared losses as
consumer staple companies reversed earlier declines and reports
showing business activity and  consumer confidence  topped
projections, helping offset concern the global economy is
slowing.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index dropped 0.7 percent to
1,152.26 at 11:40 a.m. New York time, after falling as much as
1.7 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
