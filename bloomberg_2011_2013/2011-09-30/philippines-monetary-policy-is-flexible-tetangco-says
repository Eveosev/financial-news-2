The  Philippines ’ monetary policy is
“flexible,” central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said in a
speech in Manila today.  The monetary authority has taken “preemptive steps” to
support economic growth and keep inflation within target,
Tetangco said.  The nation is in a strong position to deal with a faltering
global recovery and natural calamities, helped by a rebound in
agriculture and sustained  consumer spending , Tetangco said. An
investment grade debt rating is well within reach as the
country’s fical position improves, he said.  -- With assistance from Clarissa Batino.  To contact the reporter on this story:
