Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained
for a third week, pushing yields to five-month lows, on
speculation lending rates will come down after inflation slowed
for the first time in more than a year.  Consumer prices climbed 22.42 percent in September from a
year earlier, easing from a 23.02 percent pace in August,
according to figures released by the General Statistics Office
on Sept. 24. Vietnam’s government said last month that the
central bank will leave its benchmark  interest rates  unchanged
and consider cutting them if inflation slows.  “Yields are declining because investors are expecting that
lending rates will go down,” said Vu Anh Duc, a Hanoi-based
senior fixed-income dealer at Vietnam Bank for Industry and
Trade, also known as Vietinbank.  The yield on the benchmark five-year notes fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 12.40 percent this week,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
That was the lowest level since April 22. The rate has dropped
six basis points this month and this quarter.  The dong rose 0.4 percent to 20,832 per dollar as of 4:57
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency fell 0.1 percent this week, 0.2 percent this month and
1.2 percent this quarter. The central bank fixed the  reference
rate  at 20,628 today, according to its website. The dong is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
