Italy’s jobless rate fell last
month even amid a government austerity drive aimed at shielding
the country from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The jobless rate dropped to 7.9 percent from 8 percent in
July, Rome-based national statistics institute  Istat  said in a
preliminary estimate today. The rate declined to 8 percent in
the second quarter from a revised 8.1 percent in the previous
three-month period. Economists had predicted the rate would be
unchanged in August, the median forecast by five economists in a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Italian business confidence fell to the lowest in almost
two years this month amid concern that austerity and the debt
crisis will hurt growth. Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s
government passed a 54 billion-euro ($73 billion) package of
spending cuts and tax increases in August to convince the
 European Central Bank  to buy Italian bonds after the nation’s
borrowing costs surged to euro-era records. The plan also aims
to ease firing rules to encourage companies to take on workers.  Joblessness among those between ages 15 and 24 rose to 27.6
percent in August from 27.5 percent in the previous month, Istat
said. The institute originally reported a jobless rate of 8.2
percent in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
