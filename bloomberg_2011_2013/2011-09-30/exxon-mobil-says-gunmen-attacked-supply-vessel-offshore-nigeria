Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Nigerian unit
said gunmen attacked a vessel supplying one of its offshore oil
platforms, wounding one worker and seizing another.  “The incident has been reported to security and relevant
government agencies” after the attack in southern Akwa Ibom
state, Nigel Cookey-Gam, a spokesman in Lagos, said in an e-
mailed statement. Exxon doesn’t know where the seized worker has
been taken and the injured individual is “stable,” he said.  Violence has risen in the southern Niger River delta, home
to  Nigeria ’s oil and gas industry, after a period of relative
quiet that followed a government amnesty in 2009 and the
disarming of thousands of fighters. Nigeria is  Africa ’s largest
oil producer and fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports.  Armed attacks in the delta cut Nigeria’s oil output more
than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said this month it shut 25,000
barrels a day of crude output from its Imo River field in the
country’s southern Abia state because of the level of theft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
