Canadian natural gas fell as
storage levels approached a 10-month high.  Canadian supplies rose 20.7 billion cubic feet, or 3.3
percent, to 620.7 billion in the week ended Sept. 23, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg and Canadian Enerdata Ltd., the
most since the week ended Dec. 3.  “When you look at where they’re at, it’s almost a record
high for them at this time of year,” Gordy Elliott, a risk-
management specialist at INTL FCStone Inc. in  St. Louis Park ,
 Minnesota , said of Canadian gas supplies. “There’s oversupply
with strong production and not enough demand,” he said in a
telephone interview.  Alberta gas for October delivery fell 6.5 cents to C$3.355
per gigajoule ($3.06 per million Btu) as of 12:35 p.m. New York
time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet market.  November gas was down 6 cents to C$3.40 per gigajoule. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the
U.S. and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for November delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 3.2 cents to $3.715 per million Btu as of 12:48
p.m. local time.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta  system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.8 billion cubic
feet, about equal to the target, as of 11 a.m. New York time.  Flow Rates  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.59 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.94 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 233 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.64 billion cubic feet today, about 88 percent of its
capacity of 1.88 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.78
billion cubic feet at 11:50 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
