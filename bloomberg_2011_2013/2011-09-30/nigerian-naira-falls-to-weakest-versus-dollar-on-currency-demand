Nigeria ’s naira depreciated to the
weakest level on record against the dollar in interbank trading
on mounting demand for foreign currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated for
a fifth day, losing 0.2 percent to 159.9 per dollar by 1:13 p.m.
in Lagos, the commercial capital. That’s the lowest since 1999,
when Bloomberg started compiling the data. The naira has
retreated 4.9 percent this quarter, the biggest drop over a
similar period since the three months through March 2009.  The central bank has been using foreign-currency reserves
to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 per dollar at its twice-weekly auctions. It broke that
band on Sept. 26, reaching 155.02. Demand for dollars is set to
increase as the government invests in improving infrastructure,
further weakening the naira, FBN Capital Ltd. said on Sept. 28.  “We do not think that the authorities are comfortable with
a floating  exchange rate ,” FBN said today in an e-mailed note.
“There remains a strong intellectual preference for a managed
rate.”  Foreign reserves were at $32.58 billion on Sept. 28, a 7
percent decline from a year earlier, according to figures
published by the central bank. Prices for crude oil, which
accounts for more than 95 percent of export earnings, according
to the  Finance Ministry , were today heading for their biggest
quarterly drop since 2008. Crude for November delivery on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  fell as much as 1.2 percent, to
$81.15 a barrel.  Unmet Demand  Nigeria sold $700 million to lenders at the last auction on
Sept. 28, the most since Dec. 15 and a little less than the $703
million demanded. It was the 23rd auction at which demand wasn’t
met, with the above-average volume reflecting demand ahead of
Oct. 3, a public holiday, when there’ll be no auction, according
to FBN Capital.  Nigeria’s central bank raised its benchmark  interest rate 
on Sept. 19 for the fifth time this year by 50 basis points to
9.25 percent to curb inflation and support the naira. The
inflation rate fell for a second month to 9.3 percent in August,
the lowest level in more than three years, from 9.4 percent a
month earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Sept.
