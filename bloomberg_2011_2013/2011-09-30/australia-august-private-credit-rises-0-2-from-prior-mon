Loans provided by Australian banks
and finance companies increased 0.2 percent in August from the

News was for a 0.2 percent advance. Lending gained 3 percent
from a year earlier, the central bank said.  Loans to consumers to buy houses rose 0.4 percent from July
and advanced 5.8 percent from a year earlier, according to
todayâ€™s statement. Credit provided to consumers for purchases
other than housing fell 0.9 percent last month for an annual
drop of 0.9 percent.  Lending to companies was unchanged from July and declined
0.9 percent from a year earlier, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
