Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  asked its
banks to extend for three years a 4.9 billion-euro ($6.6
billion) credit that comes due in December, Cinco Dias reported.  Chief Financial Officer Fernando Lacadena wrote to Banco
Santander SA, which heads a syndicate of more than 40 lenders,
offering collateral worth 150 percent of the loan value, the
newspaper said.  The assets pledged include Sacyrâ€™s 20 percent stake in
 Repsol YPF SA (REP) , property holding company Testa, real estate
developer Vallehermoso and the services company Valoriza, the
newspaper said.  Sacyr would have to put up additional guarantees should the
value of those assets drop below 135 percent of the loan amount,
Cinco Dias said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
