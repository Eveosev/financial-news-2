National Grid Plc (NG/) , the operator of
Britain’s power-distribution network, said it will raise 260
million pounds ($404 million) from a sale of inflation-linked
bonds to individual investors.  The 10-year securities will be the largest issue listed on
the London Stock Exchange Group Plc’s  Order Book for Retail
Bonds , London-based National Grid said in a statement.  “This shows that there is demand for inflation-linked
products from a business such as National Grid,” Malcolm Cooper, the company’s global tax and treasury director, said in
the statement. “This has clearly exceeded our expectations and
we are extremely pleased about the total amount raised.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
