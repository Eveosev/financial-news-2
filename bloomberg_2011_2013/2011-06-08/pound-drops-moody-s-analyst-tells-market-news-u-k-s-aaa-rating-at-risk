The pound dropped and  government
bonds  declined after Market News reported that Moody’s Investors
Service analyst  Sarah Carlson  said Britain could lose its Aaa

 London  and weakened 0.4 percent to 89.69 pence per euro. The 10-
year gilt yield rose two basis points to 3.35 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
