The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  against non-payment increased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 0.5 basis point to 126
basis points as of 9:07 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at
110 basis points as of 10:20 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole CIB
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was also little changed at 110 basis
points as of 8:20 a.m. in Singapore, according to Credit
Agricole prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
