Slovenian companies increased
borrowing from domestic lenders including Nova Ljubljanska Banka
d.d. in April after two months of declines, suggesting the
credit squeeze may be easing.  Loans to companies other than banks rose 2 percent in April
from the same period a year earlier, the Ljubljana-based
government’s  economic institute  said in a report today. The
biggest increase in borrowing came from households, the
institute said without elaborating.  “Growth of loans taken out by companies at domestic banks
increased in April even though at a slow pace,” it said. Still,
lending is “limited” as banks repaid some 300 million euros
($440 million) of their debt in April, the institute said.  Slovenia’s banking industry is struggling with bad loans
from the construction sector, which put a brake on the nascent
economic recovery. Slovenia’s economy slowed to an annual 2
percent in the first quarter from 2.1 percent in the last three
months of 2010, helped by rising exports and manufacturing.
Construction investments between January and March dropped an
annual 22.6 percent, the institute said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
