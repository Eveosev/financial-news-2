Fabricato SA,  Colombia ’s largest
textile maker, rose to a four-year high after top U.S. Senate
Republicans pressured the Obama administration to allow
lawmakers to vote on free-trade accords with  South Korea ,
Colombia and Panama.  “The stock rises each time there’s pressure in the U.S.”
to pass the trade accord, said Angelica Dominguez, an analyst at
brokerage Bolsa y Renta in Medellin.  Fabricato rose 5.1 percent to 62 pesos at 12:55 p.m. New
York time, the highest on an intraday basis since May 2007.  The Obama administration last month demanded an extension
of retraining aid for workers who lose jobs to foreign
competitors before submitting the bills to Congress.  “Nothing good can come from this continued inaction,”
 Orrin Hatch , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee,
said yesterday in a statement on his website. “With respect to
international trade, the administration has adopted a policy of
delay and dither.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
