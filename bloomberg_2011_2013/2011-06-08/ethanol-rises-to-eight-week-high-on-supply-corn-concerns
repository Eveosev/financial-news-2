Ethanol futures advanced to an eight-
week high in  Chicago  amid increased demand and speculation that
global corn inventories may drop to a 37-year low.  The gasoline additive rose after an Energy Department
report showed stocks of the fuel dropped to 19.6 million
barrels, the lowest level since April 22. Days of cover slid to
22.1 from 22.9. An Agriculture Department report tomorrow may
show a drop in global reserves of corn, U.S. ethanol’s main
feedstock, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  “Some of the supply is tight,” said Jim Damask, a manager
at Biofuelsconnect, a Heathrow, Florida-based alternative energy
broker. “Some of the producers were buying. If they’re buying
it means it’s getting tighter. Plus, tomorrow’s big report.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 6.2 cents, or 2.4
percent, to settle at $2.684 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest price since April 11. The Energy Department
report today showed that production increased 0.7 percent to
915,000 barrels a day, the highest since Jan. 21.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago surged 7 cents,
or 2.7 percent, to $2.675 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive increased 4 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.795, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  jumped 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to
$2.75 a gallon and on the West Coast ethanol added 4 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.81.  Corn futures for July delivery gained 27.5 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $7.64 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Wet weather that delayed planting may leave global corn
inventories at 14.5 percent of estimated consumption, the lowest
ratio since 1974, based on government data. Tighter corn
supplies might translate into higher production costs at ethanol
plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
