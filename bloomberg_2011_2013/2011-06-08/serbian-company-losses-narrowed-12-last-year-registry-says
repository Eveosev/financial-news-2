Serbian companies’ losses narrowed by
more than 12 percent in 2010 as the economy recovered and sales
increased, the  Serbian Business Registers Agency  said.  Losses narrowed to 89.7 billion dinars ($1.32 billion) from
102.2 billion dinars the previous year, the agency said in a
 report  based on filings by 83,750 companies. Employment at the
same companies fell 6.6 percent to slightly more than 1 million.  The 2010 financial statements signal “some positive
movements,” with a “slight economic recovery” boosting
revenue by 12.5 percent and spending by 12.1 percent, according
to the agency.  While losses narrowed in the export-oriented “tradable
sector,” they widened for non-tradable industries, the agency
said. Tradable industries include agriculture, mining,
processing, energy and water. Non-tradable industries include
construction, transportation and finance.  The “growing share” of tradable industries in the overall
economy is an encouraging sign and a “potential impulse to
further sustainable economic development.”  A shortage of liquidity remains one of the key issues for
Serbian companies, “resulting in a further increase in
accumulated losses,” which rose 18.1 percent to almost $29
billion, or two-thirds of economic output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
