Grupo Isolux Corsan SA was hired to
build  Kenya ’s longest power connection, bringing the total value
of its construction contracts in Africa to 1 billion euros ($1.5
billion) in a challenge to Chinese competitors.  The closely held Spanish infrastructure and energy-services
provider won the 142 million-euro order to build a 428-kilometer
(266-mile) cable for Kenya Electricity Transmission Co., the
company said in an e-mailed press release.  The high-voltage lines take electricity to consumers from
the 300-megawatt Lake Turkana power project, which will be
Africa’s largest wind farm when completed. The cable project
will begin in the second half of this year and should take 23
months to complete.  Madrid-based Isolux has industrial or civil works under way
in  Angola , Algeria, Gabon,  Equatorial Guinea , Morocco and
Mauritania, largely related to generating or transporting power.  To contact the reporters on this story:
