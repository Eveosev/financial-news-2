Investors can buy and sell  Singapore 
government bonds on the city-state’s bourse from July 8,
according to a statement from the exchange operator.  A total of 19 notes maturing in two years or more totaling
S$74 billion ($60.2 billion) will be available for trading, the
 Singapore Exchange  said in the statement. Currently, investors
can buy or sell the securities through only dealer banks.  “Trading of Singapore government bonds on the Singapore
exchange will make the price-discovery process more efficient
and transparent, thereby reducing trading cost for investors,”
Tng Kwee Lian, head of fixed income at the exchange, said in a
statement.  Singapore’s local-currency bonds have returned 3.25 percent
this year, the third-best performance among 10 local-currency
debt indexes tracked by HSBC Holdings Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
