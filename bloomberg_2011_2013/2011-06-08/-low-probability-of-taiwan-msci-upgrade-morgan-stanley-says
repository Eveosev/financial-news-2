Frank Wang, executive director for
research at Morgan Stanley, whose team was ranked second for
 Taiwan  research by Institutional Investor magazine, comments by
phone from Taiwan on the island’s potential reclassification by
index provider MSCI Inc.  On Reclassification to Developed-Market Status:  “We see a low probability that MSCI Taiwan will be
reclassified to developed-market status. MSCI Taiwan meets the
economic development, size and liquidity requirements. Still,
roadblocks exist. They are generally qualitative, based on
international investor feedback. They include non-delivery of
the  Taiwan dollar , settlement practices and remaining
restrictions on Foreign Institutional Investors. If Taiwan does
get upgraded, there may be a $3.9 billion potential inflow.”  Stock rally in the fourth quarter:  “We have a year-end target of 10,000. We expect a strong
fourth-quarter performance by the Taiex index amid a global
economic recovery and strong earnings by tech companies.
Financial-related shares may be boosted on opportunities for
mergers and acquisitions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
