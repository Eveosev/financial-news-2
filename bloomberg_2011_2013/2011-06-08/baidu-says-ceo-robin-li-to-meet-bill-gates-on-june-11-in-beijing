Baidu Inc., owner of China’s most-
popular search-engine, said Chief Executive Officer Robin Li
will meet  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Chairman  Bill Gates  in Beijing this
weekend when they officiate at a charity event.  Gates and Li are not expected to discuss business matters
at the June 11 event, which will promote awareness of the
harmful effects of smoking, Baidu spokesman Kaiser Kuo said by
phone today. Charles Shen, a Beijing-based spokesman at
Microsoft, said he is not aware of plans by Gates to attend
meetings with local employees at the U.S. software company.  Baidu “won’t rule out” further collaboration with
Microsoft on search-engine services, Haoyu Shen, senior vice-
president at the Chinese company, said May 26. Working with
Microsoft may help Baidu speed up its overseas expansion after
the Beijing-based company overcame competition from Google Inc.
to dominate the Internet search market in China.  Microsoft co-founder Gates retired from active management
of the company in 2008 to run the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, the world’s richest charitable fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
