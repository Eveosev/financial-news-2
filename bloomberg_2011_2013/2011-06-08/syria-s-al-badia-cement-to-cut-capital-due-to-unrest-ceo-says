(Corrects story published yesterday to show reasons for
capital reduction and construction halt in first and third
paragraphs.)  Al Badia Cement JSC, a Syrian
affiliate of  Italcementi SpA (IT)  and  Saudi Arabia ’s Al Muhaidib
Group, will lower its capital by 20 percent as additional equity
is no longer needed because the project is fully funded with
long-term loans, Chief Executive Officer Khaled Al Sawaf said.  Al Badia, which started production about two months ago,
will lower its capital to 9.76 billion Syrian pounds ($205.3
million), Sawaf said today. “Listing on the stock exchange
cannot be performed with partially uncalled capital,” he said.  In March, before the outbreak of unrest, the company said
that it had halted construction of a second  production line . The
company had initially planned to build two lines with annual
production capacity of 1.6 million tons of cement each, Sawaf
said. Al Badia provides as much as 17 percent of  Syria ’s cement
demand, Sawaf said in March.  “The second line is on hold for the board’s decision based
on company’s strategic plans,” Al Sawaf said. “We are
confident of the company’s ability to raise more debt once
needed to make extra investments.”  “The second line is less costly as we have already
constructed the infrastructure for two lines,” he said.  Italcementi owns 12.5 percent of Al Badia and Al Muhaidib
29.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
