The Asia-Pacific region has six of
the world’s 10 most expensive cities for industrial real estate,
leading a recovery in commercial properties, according to CB
Richard Ellis Group Inc.  Rents in the region jumped 9 percent in the year ended
March 31, with Tokyo the world’s most expensive industrial
market, and Singapore, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and  Hong Kong 
among the 10 priciest cities, the Los Angeles-based commercial
real estate broker said in an e-mailed report.  London , Sao
Paolo, Paris and Amsterdam complete the top 10.  “A constrained industrial supply pipeline and a move by
occupiers to achieve cost savings” will drive demand and future
rental growth, CBRE Global Chief Economist Ray Torto said in an
accompanying media release. “World trade flows have also
rebounded and this will be a positive for logistics demand over
the medium term.”  Asian container lines have posted increasing profits as
economic recoveries in the U.S. and  Europe , and demand from
 China , boosted shipping markets. Rising import levels will
continue to contribute to increased demand for logistics centers
and warehousing space, CBRE said.  CBRE’s global industrial rent index rose 1.3 percent in the
first quarter, the biggest growth since the second quarter of
2007. Rents climbed 2.1 percent around the world in the year
ending March 31, the group said.  Still, as  consumer confidence  globally wavers and
unemployment levels remain high in major markets, “the rate of
recovery in the sector will continue to be fragile,” CBRE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
