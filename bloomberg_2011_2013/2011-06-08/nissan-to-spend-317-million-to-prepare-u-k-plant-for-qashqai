(Corrects names of models built at plant in third paragraph
of story published June 8.)  Nissan Motor Co. will build the next
generation of the Qashqai crossover vehicle at its Sunderland,
 England  plant, investing 192 million pounds ($317 million), the
carmaker said today.  The investment will help secure about 6,000 jobs in the
U.K., Nissan said in a statement. The company will also spend
420 million pounds to prepare the factory to build its Leaf
electric car beginning in 2013 and to set up a separate facility
to make batteries for the Yokohama, Japan-based automaker and
its partner  Renault SA. (RNO)   Nissan already builds its Note mini-MPV crossover model and
the current version of the Qashqai at the Sunderland plant. The
factory, in the northeast of England, built 423,000 cars last
year, exporting about 80 percent. It’s been the U.K.’s No. 1 car
factory since 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
