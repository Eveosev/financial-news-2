Latvian consumer prices rose at the
fastest pace in 25 months in May as the growth of food and fuel
costs accelerated.  The inflation rate advanced to 5 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 4.5 percent in the previous month, the
Riga-based  statistics office  said on its website today. The
median estimate of eight economists in a Bloomberg survey was 5
percent. On the month, consumer prices grew 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
