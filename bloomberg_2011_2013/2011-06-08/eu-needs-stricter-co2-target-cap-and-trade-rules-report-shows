The European Union should move to a
stricter emissions-reduction target for 2020 to attain its 2050
climate goal in a cost-effective way, a report by a network of
climate experts and a research group showed.  Standing by the current EU goal to cut emissions by 20
percent in 2020 compared with 1990 levels would mean a “rapidly
accelerating reduction effort” to attain the 2050 goal of at
least 80 percent, according the report by Climate Strategies, an
international network of climate experts, and the Institute for
 Sustainable Development  and International Relations, a Paris-
based research institute also known as IDDRI.  A move to a more ambitious target of cutting  greenhouse
gases  by 25 percent domestically in 2020, or by 30 percent
including offsets earned by companies for emissions-reduction
projects in  developing countries , would “significantly lower”
the costs of reaching the 2050 target, according to the report.  The EU also needs to improve the stringency of its
emissions trading system, the world’s largest cap-and-trade
program that imposes pollution caps on more than 11,000 power
producers and manufacturers, IDDRI and Climate Strategies said.
A continuation of the annual cap decrease of 1.74 percent in the
system after 2020 would be “inconsistent” with the EU long-
term climate goals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
