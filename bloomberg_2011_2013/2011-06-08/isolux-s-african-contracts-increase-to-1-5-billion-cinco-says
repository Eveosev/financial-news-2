Grupo Isolux Corsan SA was hired to
build  power lines  in Kenya, bringing the total value of its
construction contracts in Africa to 1 billion euros ($1.5
billion) in a challenge to Chinese competitors, Cinco Dias said.  The closely held Spanish infrastructure and energy-services
provider won the 142 million-euro order to build a 428-kilometer
(266-mile) cable for Kenya Electricity Transmission Co., the
newspaper  reported , citing no one.  The high-voltage lines take electricity to consumers from
the 300-megawatt Lake Turkana power project, which will be
Africaâ€™s largest wind farm when completed, the report said. The
cable project will begin in the second half of this year and
should take 23 months to complete, Cinco Dias said.  Madrid-based Isolux has industrial or civil works under way
in  Angola , Algeria, Gabon,  Equatorial Guinea , Morocco and
Mauritania, largely related to generating or transporting power,
the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
