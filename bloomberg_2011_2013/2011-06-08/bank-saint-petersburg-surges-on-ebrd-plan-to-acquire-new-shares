Bank Saint Petersburg jumped the most
since October after the  European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development  said it will participate in the lender’s 3.52
billion-ruble ($127 million) new-share offer.  The stock surged as much as 8.7 percent and closed 4.9
percent higher at 139.9 rubles by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow, its
biggest one-day gain since Oct. 27.  The bank will issue as many as 24 million shares at 146.66
rubles apiece, according to an e-mailed statement from the St.
Petersburg-based lender today. The board of the EBRD approved
the purchase of 2.75 billion rubles of shares, the statement
said.  The share offer and the participation of the EBRD is
“positive” for the lender’s stock,  Luis Saenz , the London-
based director of international sales at Otkritie Securities
Ltd., wrote in e-mailed comments today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
