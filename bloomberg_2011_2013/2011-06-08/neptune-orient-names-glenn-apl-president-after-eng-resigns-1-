Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.,  Southeast
Asia ’s biggest container line, named Kenneth Glenn as president
of its  APL Ltd.  unit after incumbent Eng Aik Meng resigned.  Eng will leave  APL  on Sept. 1 to take on a new position
outside the industry, Neptune Orient said today in a statement
to the Singapore stock exchange. Glenn is currently head of
APL’s north Asia region.  Eng’s departure comes after Neptune Orient announced in
April that Ng Yat Chung, a former Singapore army chief and
manager at controlling shareholder Temasek Holdings Pte, will
replace current Chief Executive Officer Ron Widdows in January.  Glenn has been with APL since 2000 and was in charge of the
company’s Asia-Europe trade from 2000 to 2005, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
