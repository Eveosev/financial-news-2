New Zealand ’s dollar reached a record
versus the dollar after the nation’s central bank said commodity
prices remain “very strong” and  interest rates  will rise
within two years.  The so-called kiwi gained against all 16 of its most-traded
counterparts after the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand left its
benchmark Official Cash Rate unchanged at a record-low 2.5
percent today. The decision was predicted by all 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Australia’s dollar rose, erasing
earlier losses, as stocks and commodities advanced.  “The central bank’s statement was hawkish and effectively
allows for a December hike,” said  Imre Speizer , a market
strategist in Auckland at Westpac Banking Corp., Australia’s
second-biggest lender. “It’s bullish for the kiwi dollar.”  New Zealand’s dollar rose 1.6 percent to 82.85 U.S. cents
at 12:36 p.m. in New York, touching 83.02, the highest level on
record. It advanced 2 percent to 66.438 yen.  Australia ’s dollar was little changed at $1.0634 from
$1.0623 yesterday. It earlier dropped as much as 0.6 percent.
The currency was at 85.236 yen from 84.88 yen. The Aussie
dropped to NZ$1.2834 from NZ$1.3031, after touching NZ$1.2809,
the lowest since Jan. 28.  “A gradual increase in the OCR over the next two years
will be required,” Governor Alan Bollard said in a statement
accompanying the decision. “The pace and timing of increases
will be guided by the speed of recovery.”  Bollard said that the rise of the local currency following
today’s Monetary Policy Statement was an “over-reaction”, in a
Parliament hearing in Wellington today.  The Aussie earlier weakened after the statistics bureau
said the nation added 7,800 jobs in May, while losing 22,000
full-time positions. That compared with the median estimate for
a 25,000 increase in a Bloomberg News survey of 25 economists.  To contact the reporters on this story:
