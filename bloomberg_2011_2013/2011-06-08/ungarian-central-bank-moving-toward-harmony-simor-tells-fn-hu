Hungary ’s central bank is
“cautiously” moving toward more harmony with new members of
the Monetary Council, the news website fn . hu reported today,
citing bank President Andras Simor.  Asked to describe the cooperation with policy makers who
joined the council in March, Simor said it is “cautious and
tentative,” according to fn.hu.  It is “normal” for the panel’s seven members to disagree
on certain matters and they are “cautiously” moving toward
settling disputes without conflict, Simor told the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
