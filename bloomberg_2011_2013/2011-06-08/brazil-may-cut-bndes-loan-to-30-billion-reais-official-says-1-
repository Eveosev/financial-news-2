Brazil  is considering cutting a
Treasury loan to the state development bank as demand for credit
from the lender slows, a government official familiar with the
discussions said.  The government may cut funding to the Rio de Janeiro-based
BNDES to 30 billion reais ($19 billion) this year, from an
originally planned 55 billion reais, said the official, who
asked to not be identified because he is not authorized to speak
publicly about the issue.  BNDES lent 24.9 billion reais in the first quarter of 2011,
down 2 percent from the same period a year ago, the bank said in
a report on its website on May 16. In the year through March,
the BNDES lent 143.1 billion, according to the bank’s website.
First-quarter lending was in line with expectations, the bank
said.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said March 3 that the
Treasury could lend 55 billion reais to BNDES to support its
subsidized  credit line  known as the Program to Sustain
Investment.  A reduction in BNDES lending would help the central bank’s
fight against inflation, said Flavio Serrano, senior economist
at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in  Sao Paulo .  “Brazil has a shortfall of investment, but right now the
priority is fighting inflation,” Serrano said, speaking by
phone from Sao Paulo. “Limiting this lending slows the rise in
total credit, which is positive for monetary policy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
