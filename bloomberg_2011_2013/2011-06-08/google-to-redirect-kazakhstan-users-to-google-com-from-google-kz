Google Inc. (GOOG)  said Kazakhstan is trying
to “create borders on the Web” by imposing rules on Internet
search, a move that may degrade the quality of Web surfing in
the Central Asian nation.  Google is redirecting users away from the customized search
engine in Kazakhstan after the country’s government required
that all queries go through local servers,  Mountain View ,
California-based Google said yesterday in a  blog post . Google
says it routes searchers to servers around the world to answer
requests the fastest way possible.  “If we were to operate Google.kz only via servers located
inside Kazakhstan, we would be helping to create a fractured
Internet,” Bill Coughran, senior vice president of research and
systems infrastructure, wrote in the blog post.  Kazakhstan  users will instead be steered toward Google.com,
which will mean search results won’t be customized for the
country, Google said.  Google has chafed at other countries’ restrictions too.
Last year, the company started directing users in  China  to its
Hong Kong service rather than subject itself to government
censorship rules.  “We find ourselves in a difficult situation: creating
borders on the Web raises important questions for us not only
about network efficiency but also about user privacy and free
expression,” Coughran said in the post about Kazakhstan.  Google fell $2.03 to $519.03 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The shares had fallen 13 percent this year
before today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
