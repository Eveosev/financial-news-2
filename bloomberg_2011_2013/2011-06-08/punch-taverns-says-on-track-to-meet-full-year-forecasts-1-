Punch Taverns Plc (PUB) , the U.K. pub
operator that is splitting in two, said today it’s on track to
meet full year forecasts and is making good progress on demerger
plans.  Sales at managed pubs open at least 12 months at the Spirit
unit climbed 7.3 percent in the 12 weeks to May 28, the Burton-
Upon-Trent, England-based company said today in a statement
distributed by the Regulatory News Service. Net income at Punch
leased pubs fell 3.3 percent in the same period.  Punch Taverns said it is making “good progress” in its
plans to separate Spirit, the managed-pub unit that includes
brands such as Chef & Brewer and Flaming Grill, from its Punch
leased-pub division. The planned demerger needs the approval of
bondholders, who said in March they were owed about 2.5 billion
pounds ($4.1 billion) by the leased division, according to
bondholders in March.  The stock declined 6.4 percent to 70.2 pence this year as
of yesterday. The stock has fallen from a high of 13.78 pounds
in May, 2007.  Chief Executive Officer Ian Dyson, formerly Marks & Spencer
Group Plc’s finance director, proposed splitting the company in
March, saying its strategy isn’t ’’sustainable.’’  “We are pleased that our operational initiatives continue
to translate into improved performance for both Spirit and
Punch,” Dyson said in today’s statement.  “Despite the
challenging UK consumer environment we are on track to meet our
full year expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
