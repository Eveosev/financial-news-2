The Treasury Department’s $21 billion
sale of 10-year notes may draw a yield of 2.961 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The securities mature in May 2021 and yielded 2.970 percent
in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York time.  Last month’s offering of 10-year notes drew a yield of
3.210 percent. The May 11 sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 3, versus 3.13 at the April auction and an average
of 3.09 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 47.2 percent of the securities
at last month’s offering, compared with 42.4 percent at the
April sale. The average for the past 10 sales is 51.1 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 8.4 percent of the
notes at the May sale, compared with 5.9 percent in the previous
month and an average of 7.8 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Ten-year notes have returned 4.3 percent this year,
compared with a 2.8 percent gain for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The U.S. sold $32 billion of three-year debt yesterday at a
yield of 0.765 percent and drew the highest demand from indirect
bidders since January. It will sell $13 billion in 30-year
securities tomorrow in the last of this week’s $66 billion of
note and bond sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
