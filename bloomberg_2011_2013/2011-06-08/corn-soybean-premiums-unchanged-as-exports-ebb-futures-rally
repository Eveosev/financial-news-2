Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped in June to terminals near  New Orleans  were unchanged
relative to Chicago futures as demand for exports waned.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 63 cents to 65 cents a bushel above July futures, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis was 75
cents to 80 cents a bushel above July futures for the fourth
straight session.  “Export demand is slowing,” said Brian Basting, an
analyst at Advance Trading Inc. in Bloomington,  Illinois .
“There’s not a lot of last year’s crop left to sell, supporting
a steady basis.”  Corn futures for July delivery jumped 27.5 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $7.64 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest gain since May 18. The price has more than doubled in
the past year.  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 7.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $14.015 a bushel, the fifth gain in six sessions.
The contract has climbed 52 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
