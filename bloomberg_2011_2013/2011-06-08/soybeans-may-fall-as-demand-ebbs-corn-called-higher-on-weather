What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade on concern that the global economic
recovery may slow, reducing demand for commodities, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler,  Indiana .
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.15 cent to 0.25 cent
a pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open down 50 cents
to $1 for 2,000 pounds.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago as hot, dry weather in the southern U.S. may
stunt development of crops that are needed to bridge supplies
until the Midwest harvest, Gerlach said.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent a bushel lower to 1 cent higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as increased harvesting of winter wheat in the
southern U.S. Great Plains boosts immediate supplies from a
drought-reduced crop, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
