British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) 
will increase spending by more than 50 percent on commissioning
and producing home-grown content over the next three years in a
bid to attract more subscribers to its pay-TV offering.  The U.K.’s biggest pay-TV operator, which currently spends
380 million pounds ($623 million) a year on British programming,
will raise that to 600 million pounds over the coming three
years, Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Darroch said in London
today.  “Home-grown content resonates strongly,” he said. “We
can both bring more quality and value to existing customers,
while also reaching out to more people who haven’t yet chosen
pay TV.” The increase falls within the company’s previously
announced forecast on total programming spending, he said.  BSkyB reached its target of 10 million subscribers last
year, prompting  Rupert Murdoch ’s  News Corp. (NWSA)  to make a 7.8
billion-pound bid for the 61 percent it doesn’t already own as
Murdoch seeks to reap more of the broadcaster’s increasing cash
flow. BSkyB spurned the 700-pence-a-share bid and said it wanted
at least 800 pence.  The level of programming spending will increase regardless
of News Corp.’s bid, Darroch said at an event in London tonight.
“We certainly hope this path will continue whatever the
course.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
