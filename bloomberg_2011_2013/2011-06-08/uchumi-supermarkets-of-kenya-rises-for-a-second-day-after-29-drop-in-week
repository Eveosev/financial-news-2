Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., a Kenyan
retailer that resumed trading last week after a five-year
suspension due to bankruptcy, rose for the second day on
speculation its shares fell too far too fast, making its stock
attractive relative to peers.  The shares climbed as much as 6.1 percent to 10.5 shillings
before trading 3 percent higher at 10.2 shillings by 1:24 p.m.
in the capital, Nairobi. The stock lost 29 percent in four days
after trading restarted May 31. Uchumi trades on a multiple of
4.4 times reported earnings compared with 14.8 times profit for
the MSCI Frontier Market Index.  Uchumi went into receivership in June 2006 with debts of
2.2 billion shillings ($26 million), of which 957 million
shillings was owed to Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. and PTA Bank
Ltd. The receivership ended on March 4, 2010, after most of the
company’s debts were cleared and others converted into shares.  “There was knee-jerk selling from retail investors who
have been holding paper that they want to convert to money,”
 Aly-Khan Satchu , an independent analyst, said in a phone
interview from Nairobi today. “The reflex selling is over and
we can see Uchumi has been cleaned up and is a strong candidate
for a potential suitor. The consumer sector is extremely
attractive for foreign investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
