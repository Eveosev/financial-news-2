Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) ,  Japan ’s
third-largest shipping line, rose the most in a week in  Tokyo 
after Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. raised its
stock rating on prospects for a rebound in shipping demand.  Kawasaki Kisen gained 1.2 percent to 264 yen at the 3 p.m.
close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Mitsubishi UFJ
increased its rating on the Tokyo-based company to
“outperform” from “neutral.”  Carmakers including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Honda Motor Co. and
Nissan Motor Co. are among Japanese exporters that have raced to
restore output after Japan’s March 11 earthquake, raising
prospects for a rebound in demand for exports of cars and
manufactured goods. Toyota, which had the biggest drop in
Japanese production in 35 years in April, predicts output will
increase this month and return to normal levels as early as
November.  “The rebound in Japanese production is faster than we had
expected,”  Ryota Himeno , an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities, wrote in a report. “After a very tough
April and May we see upside for the business environment.”  Japanese vehicle exports tumbled 68 percent in April, the
most since at least 1990, according to figures from the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association compiled by Bloomberg.  Himeno maintained his stock rating on Nippon Yusen K.K. at
“outperform” and of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. at “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
