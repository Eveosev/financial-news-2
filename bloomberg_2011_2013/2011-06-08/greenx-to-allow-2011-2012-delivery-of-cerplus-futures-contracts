Green Exchange Holding LLC said it
planned to allow delivery starting next month of its CERplus
contracts in 2011 and 2012, providing traders with transparency
on the price of banned and non-banned credits.  GreenX currently offers Certified Emission Reduction
contracts that can include banned credits, such as the December
future. They’ve risen 9.9 percent so far this year and last
traded on June 1 at 12.77 euros ($18.63) a metric ton.  The exchange’s CERplus contracts are currently for delivery
in 2013, the first year of the European Union carbon market’s
third phase. They are for CER credits deemed eligible for
compliance with the EU program, as published in the official EU
journal.  The European Commission  today adopted a ban  on the use of
industrial-gas credits in  Europe ’s emissions trading system
starting in May 2013. The ban includes CERs from plants cutting
hydrofluorocarbon-23 gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
