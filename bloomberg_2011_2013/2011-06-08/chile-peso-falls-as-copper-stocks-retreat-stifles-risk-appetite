Chile ’s peso weakened for the third
time in four days as a fall in the price of copper, the
country’s main export, and a slump in global stocks reduced
appetite for riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 467.38 per  U.S. dollar 
from 466.53 yesterday.  “The world isn’t looking good and copper is down, so that
offset the higher-than-expected inflation data earlier today,”
said Matias  Madrid , an economist at Banco Penta in Santiago.  Chilean consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in May from April,
the National Statistics Institute said, compared with the 0.3
percent median forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Global growth concerns led the euro and European stocks lower
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday
that the U.S. recovery has been “frustratingly slow,” and
German industrial production unexpectedly declined for the first
time in four months. The price of copper, which accounts for
half of Chile’s exports, fell for the first time in four days.  The Euro Stoxx 50 index fell as much as 1.3 percent, the
euro weakened as much as 0.8 percent, and copper slumped as much
as 2.4 percent in  New York , the most in three weeks.  Chilean traders expect the peso to trade at 468 in seven
days and weaken to 475 in three months, according to a survey
posted today by the central bank on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
