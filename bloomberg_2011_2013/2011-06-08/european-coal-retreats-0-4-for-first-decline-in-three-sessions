European coal derivatives fell after
closing yesterday at the highest price in more than a month on
speculation demand might strengthen.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year dropped $1, or 0.8 percent, to $130 a
metric ton by 11:26 a.m. in  London . Yesterday’s close of $131
was the highest since May 4. Prices have risen 21 percent in the
past year.  Coal climbed yesterday on  Germany ’s decision to shut its
nuclear-power plants by 2022 and lower water levels in European
reservoirs. Reserves in  France , where about 20 percent of power
comes from running water through turbines, are down from this
time last year. They’re under median levels since 2009 in
 Norway , where hydropower plays a bigger part in the energy mix
than any other European country.  Profit from running coal-fired power plants for the next
month, the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 6.74 euros
($9.87) a megawatt-hour, compared with 3.03 euros from burning
natural gas, Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses
electricity prices in Germany,  Europe ’s biggest energy consumer,
and takes emission costs into account.  December carbon-dioxide permits under the European Union
cap-and-trade system were 0.5 percent lower at 16.56 euros a
ton. Gas for delivery in the six months through September 2012
to the U.K., Europe’s biggest consumer of the fuel, was
unchanged at 65.95 pence ($1.08) a therm in London.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
