Malaysia ’s ringgit fell the most in
two weeks on concern that export demand will slow after U.S.
Federal Reserve officials said they were disappointed with their
economy’s recovery.  The currency snapped a three-day gain as Asian stocks fell,
tracking losses in U.S. equities yesterday. A government report
tomorrow will show Malaysia’s factory output rose 2.5 percent in
April from a year earlier, compared with 2.4 percent in March,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  “Confidence on global economic growth appears to have
ebbed and that is putting pressure on emerging-market assets,”
said Manokaran Mottain, a senior economist at AmResearch Sdn. in
Kuala Lumpur. “This may raise the odds of  Bank Negara  holding
off a rate increase in its July meeting.”  The ringgit weakened 0.4 percent to 3.0185 per dollar as of
4:40 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has declined 1.9 percent since reaching
a 13-year high of 2.9598 on May 2.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said record monetary stimulus
is still needed to boost a “frustratingly slow” U.S. recovery,
while New York Fed President  William Dudley  said the rebound
remains “distinctly subpar.”  Bank Negara raised its overnight policy rate to 3 percent
from 2.75 percent on May 5, saying the economy was on a steady
growth path.  Government bonds  gained as concern about slower growth
boosted demand for the safest debt before an auction next week.  The yield on the 4.16 percent note due July 2021 fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.98 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. The price increased 0.45, or 4.5
ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 101.45.  The government will sell an additional 4 billion ringgit
($1.3 billion) of the 2021 notes on June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
