Shareholders of Eurasian Natural
Resources Corp., a metals producer in  Kazakhstan , voted against
rehiring independent directors Richard Sykes and Kenneth Olisa
and the company began a three-month appraisal of the board.  The review is aimed at “establishing a board structure
that can best support the group whilst complying with U.K.
corporate governance best practice,” ENRC said today in a
statement after its annual general meeting. Directors Abdraman
Yedilbayev and Eduard Utepov didn’t apply for re-election, the
company said.  Resolutions to reappoint Sykes and Olisa to the board were
rejected by 84 percent of the vote, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
