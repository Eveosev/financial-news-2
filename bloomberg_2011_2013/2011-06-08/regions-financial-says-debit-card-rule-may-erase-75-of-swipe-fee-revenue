Regions Financial Corp. (RF) ,  Alabama ’s
biggest bank, said a proposed rule that caps debit-card swipe
fees may cost the lender 75 percent of its revenue from that
business.  Regions collected $346 million in such fees last year,
Chief Financial Officer David Turner said today at an investor
conference in  New York . “The 12-cent cap that they put on just
isn’t even remotely close to covering our costs,” Turner said,
referring to rules proposed by the  Federal Reserve . The lender
may have to decide whether to “even offer a debit card, or, if
we do, have the customer pay for that,” he said.  The U.S. Senate today rejected a delay of the caps, which
are set to take effect July 21. The Fed has proposed capping the
fees at 12 cents a transaction, replacing a formula that
averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price.  Regions agreed to purchase its branded $1 billion credit-
card portfolio from FIA Card Services, the Birmingham-based
lender said yesterday in a statement. The acquisition of 500,000
existing Regions’ accounts is part of the bank’s strategy to
mitigate potential losses of swipe-fee revenue, Turner said.  “There will be some customers, that if you charge them for
a debit card, they’ll just use a  credit card , and that’s why
we’re back into credit cards,” Turner said.  Regions rose 6 cents to $6.13 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange Composite trading. The shares have fallen 13 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
