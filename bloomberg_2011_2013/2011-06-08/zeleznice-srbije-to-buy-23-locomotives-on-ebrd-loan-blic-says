Zeleznice Srbije ,  Serbia â€™s state-run
railway company, will invite bids to supply 23 electric
locomotives by the end of the year,  Blic  newspaper reported,
citing General Manager Milovan Markovic.  The locomotives for domestic use will be bought with the
support of a 100 million-euro ($147 million) loan the company
agreed on last year with the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, Markovic told the newspaper.  Zeleznice may also consider another EBRD loan for buying
bigger engines for international routes, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
