Natural gas futures rose, reaching a
10-month high for a third consecutive day, as hotter-than-normal
weather expected this week signaled stronger demand from  power
plants  to run air conditioners.  Prices gained 0.3 percent as forecasters including
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , said
temperatures will be above-normal in the East, Midwest and South
through June 12. A government report tomorrow may show U.S. gas
stockpiles increased less than average, according to analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The weather has been quite bullish,” said  Kyle Cooper ,
director of research for IAF Advisors in Houston. “There are
also expectations of lower injection tomorrow.”  Natural gas for July delivery gained 1.6 cents to $4.847
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement price since July 30. Gas has
risen 10 percent this year.  Heat advisories and warnings extended from New York to
northern Virginia today, including Washington, Baltimore and
Philadelphia, where temperatures are forecast to reach 99
degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius), according to the  National
Weather Service .  The high in  Manhattan ’s Central Park may reach 95, which
would tie a record for the day set in 1933, according to the
weather service.  Air Conditioning  Cooling demand in the U.S. may be 25 percent above normal
from tomorrow through June 15,  David Salmon , a meteorologist
with Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , said in a note to
clients today.  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  The department may say tomorrow that gas inventories gained
79 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 3, based on the
median of 19 analyst estimates.  The five-year average stockpile increase for the week is 96
billion, according to Energy Department data. Supplies climbed
98 billion cubic feet a year earlier.  Gas fell earlier on concern production will be more than
enough to meet summer power demand.  “Gas is at the top of the current trading range,” said
 James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics, an energy
research firm in  London ,  Arkansas . “It will be difficult to hit
$5 with rising production.”  Gas Production  Marketed gas production will average 64.61 billion cubic
feet a day in 2011, up 4.5 percent from 61.83 billion produced
in 2010, the Energy Department said in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook  yesterday.  “Production continues to grow at a strong pace despite a
significant decline in gas-directed drilling activity,” the
department said in the report. “Growth in oil-directed drilling
activity could lead to significant increases in associated
natural gas production.”  Gas drilling rigs rose six to 887 last week, according to
Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. The total was down 6.3 percent
from a year earlier. Oil rigs rose one to a record 959.  Gas inventories will “remain robust given higher forecast
production throughout the 2011 injection season,” the Energy
Department said in the report.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
328,083 as of 2:55 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 316,000. Volume was 394,838 yesterday. Open interest was
981,615 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
941,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
