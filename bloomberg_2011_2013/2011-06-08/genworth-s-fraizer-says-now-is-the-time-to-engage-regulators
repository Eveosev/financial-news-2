Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the life
insurer and mortgage guarantor, said companies in the industry
need to build relations with regulators in Washington who may
not understand how the companies work.  “Clearly, now is the time to be engaged, because I think
we’re resetting the regulatory table,” Chief Executive Officer
Michael Fraizer said today at a conference sponsored by  Standard
& Poor’s  in New York. Genworth is based in Richmond, Virginia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
