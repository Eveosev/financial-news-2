BP Plc (BP/)  said that renewables added
more than petroleum-based products to the world’s primary energy
consumption growth in the five years through 2010.  Wind, solar, geothermal, biofuels used for power generation
and transport have contributed about 1.8 percent of global
primary  energy supply  last year, according to BP  Statistical
Review . At the same time, China became the largest wind-power
generator, overtaking the U.S. and accounting for about 48
percent of all new capacity.  “Over the last 10 years, their share has almost trebled,”
BP Plc’s Chief Economist Christof Ruehl  said today in London .
“Over the last five years, their contribution to primary energy
growth was almost 10 percent. That is, higher than the
contribution of petroleum-based products.”  London-based BP, which has invested about $5 billion in
alternative energy projects since 2005, has been expanding its
U.S. wind projects and secured a Brazilian biofuel production
venture, Chief Executive Bob Dudley said today in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
