Gulf Arab states may have a single
Shariah board for the region’s Islamic financial institutions in
five to 10 years, a Shariah scholar said in Dubai today.  A “supreme Shariah council” will help reduce the cost of
issuing sukuk and boost Islamic services offered by financial
institutions that comply with the religion’s ban on interest,
said Hussain Hamed Hassan, head of  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) ’s
Shariah committee.  Hassan, who is also chairman of the Shariah Coordination
Committee of the Islamic Financial Institutions in the  United
Arab Emirates , told Bloomberg in June last year that the single
Shariah council may be established by 2013.  The scholar criticized central banks for treating Shariah-
compliant financial institutions as if they were non-Islamic
companies. Only a “few” central banks were exceptions,
including those in Bahrain and  Sudan , he said.  Hassan also said auditing practices used for Islamic
financial industry after the sale of sukuk were “dishonest”
because the assets sold during the sale of Islamic bonds remain
on companies’ balance sheets even after the issuer receives the
funds raised. Most sukuk are based on ijarah, a sale and lease
agreement as in real estate.  “If I sold assets and I took the money in my pocket, why
is the asset still in my balance sheet?” Hassan asked.  The scholar serves on the Shariah boards of more than 20
Islamic financial institutions, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
