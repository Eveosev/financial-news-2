Iran  will continue selling crude to
 India  even though it is owned $2 billion due to restrictions on
payments, the state-run  Fars  news agency reported without saying
where it got the information or providing details.  Iran is under international sanctions over its nuclear
program, and punitive measures include restrictions on financial
transactions with the Persian Gulf country.  In a May 31 meeting, Indian and Iranian officials agreed to
continue discussions on a method to make payments for oil
purchased from the Islamic Republic. No date has been set for
the next round of talks with Iranian officials, according to the
Fars report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
