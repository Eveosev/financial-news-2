Station Casinos Inc., the biggest
U.S. gambling company in bankruptcy, won the last court approval
it needs to exit bankruptcy, a company spokeswoman said.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Gregg W. Zive in Reno,  Nevada ,
approved a reorganization plan for Green Valley Ranch Resort,
Spa & Casino that would sell the property to a group led by
Station’s founding family. Lori Nelson, a Station spokeswoman,
said the Las Vegas-based company would exit bankruptcy “in the
coming weeks.”  Station is being reassembled by its original family, led by
Frank Fertitta and his brother, Vice Chairman Lorenzo Fertitta,
who will own 45 percent of the restructured casino company after
investing almost $200 million, Station said last month. Other
owners include Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital LLC and some
lenders.  Station, which filed Chapter 11 in July 2009 after a
leveraged buyout by the Fertitta family and Colony Capital,
plans to exit  bankruptcy protection  before the end of June, with
17 of the company’s 18 casinos still controlled by the existing
owners.  The Fertitta-led group is paying about $500 million for
Green Valley. The resort was co-owned by Station and the closely
held Greenspun Corp.  The bankruptcy case is In re Station Casinos Inc., 09-
52477,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Nevada (Reno).  To contact the reporters on this story:
