Chilean consumer prices increased 0.4
percent in May from the previous month, the National Statistics
Institute said in a report today.  The median estimate of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for consumer prices to climb 0.3 percent in May from April.  Prices rose 3.3 percent from the previous year as monthly
 core inflation , which excludes fuel and produce, was 0.3
percent, the institute said today. The median forecast of 15
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for annual inflation in May
to remain unchanged from April at 3.2 percent.  Chile’s central bank targets annual inflation of 3 percent,
plus or minus one percentage point over a 24-month horizon.
Consumer price pressures have moderated, which could affect
monetary policy at the central bank, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said June 6.  “There’s space to change the pace of interest rate
increases for various reasons,” he told reporters in Santiago.
“First of all, external inflation is subsiding. We’ve cut
public spending, which also helps. And we’re also seeing that
inflation expectations have subsided.”  Chile ’s central bank has increased  interest rates  in 11 of
its past 12 monthly meetings to 5 percent, raising lending costs
by a half-point in the past three months.  Chile’s government will cut planned spending this year by
$750 million, which is equivalent to about 0.4 percent of gross
domestic product, Larrain told lawmakers in Valparaiso in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
