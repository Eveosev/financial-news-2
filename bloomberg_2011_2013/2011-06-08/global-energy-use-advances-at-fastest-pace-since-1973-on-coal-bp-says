Energy consumption worldwide advanced
at the fastest pace since 1973, driving greenhouse-gas emissions
to a record and increasing the threat of  climate change ,  BP Plc (BP/) 
said in an annual report.  Use of energy rose 5.6 percent in 2010, rebounding from the
recession’s drag on demand, according to the BP Statistical
Review of World Energy report for 2011, released today.
Increases in fossil-fuel consumption, which included a 10
percent jump in use of coal by China to a record 1.7 billion
metric tons of oil equivalent, pushed emissions growth to its
biggest jump since 1969, BP said.  Global carbon emissions from electricity generation climbed
to a record last year as growth accelerated in emerging
economies, the  International Energy Agency  said May 31. Use of
fossil fuels may drive temperatures beyond a 2 degrees Celsius
(3.6 Fahrenheit) limit sought in United Nations-overseen
climate-protection talks, the agency said.  “The general picture of strong energy growth translates
into bad news for  carbon emissions ,” Christof Ruehl, BP’s chief
economist, said at a London presentation of the report. “With
coal consumption growing at the highest rate among fossil fuels,
global CO2 emissions from energy measured by standard conversion
rates grew by 5.8 percent in 2010.”  Oil consumption rose 3.1 percent to 4 billion tons, or
87.38 million barrels a day, as reserves advanced 0.5 percent to
1.3832 trillion barrels at the end of last year from a revised
1.3766 trillion in 2009, BP said.  India ’s deposits climbed 55
percent to 9 billion barrels.  Saudi Arabia ’s reserves were the largest, at 264.5 billion
barrels, little changed from 2009. The  Middle East  had 54.4
percent of total  oil deposits , down from 2009’s 56.6 percent.  Coal Consumption  China, the U.S. and the European Union all boosted their
consumption of coal, as global use of the most plentiful fossil
fuel advanced 7.6 percent to 3.6 billion tons of oil equivalent.
China increased its use of the dirtiest fuel in terms of
 greenhouse gases  by 10 percent to 1.7 billion tons.  U.S. coal use advanced by 5.7 percent, while EU consumption
rose 3.8 percent. Global coal reserves rose 4.2 percent to 860.9
billion tons, enough to meet consumption for 118 years. At the
end of 2009, the reserves-to-production ratio was 119 years.  Germany ’s proved coal reserves were six times higher at the
end of last year compared with 2009, BP said, citing World
Energy Council statistics. The country’s coal deposits were 40.7
billion tons, compared with 6.7 billion tons a year earlier.  Asia Gas Demand  Natural-gas consumption advanced 7.4 percent to 2.9 billion
tons of oil equivalent, driven by a 13 percent jump in the Asia-
Pacific region.  The U.S. increased its use of renewable energy other than
nuclear and hydroelectric generation by more than  China  last
year, BP said, reporting the data for the first time. U.S.
consumption of renewable energy increased by 5.5 million tons of
oil equivalent, while use in China jumped by 5.2 million tons.  China’s use of renewables, which rose from a lower base,
jumped 75 percent to 12.1 million tons, compared with 2009. U.S.
use of renewables advanced 16 percent to 39.1 million tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
