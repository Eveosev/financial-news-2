OAO Bashneft, the Russian oil
producer controlled by billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov ’s AFK
Sistema, said first-quarter profit jumped 53 percent, beating
estimates, as oil output and prices rose.  Net income advanced to $370 million from $242 million a
year earlier, Bashneft said today in a statement. That was more
than a median estimate of $359 million from six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Bashneft boosted oil output 9.1 percent to average 3.68
million metric tons in the quarter, or 291,000 barrels a day,
the company said. Prices for Urals blend, Russia’s benchmark
export crude, rose 36 percent to average $102.20 a barrel, the
Ufa, Bashkortostan-based company said.  Revenue advanced 42 percent to $4.14 billion, and earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 39
percent to $856 million, the company said.  In April, Bashneft agreed to sell 25.1 percent of its
largest new development, the Trebs and Titov fields in the
Arctic, for $167 million to OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer and owner of the regional export terminal.  Sistema may sell a 25 percent stake in Bashneft to  India ’s
Oil & Natural Gas Corp. this year as it pursues growth, Sistema
Chief Executive Mikhail Shamolin said in April. Sistema, which
also owns 49 percent of OAO Russneft, aims to build oil business
to 1.2 million barrels a day output, Yevtushenkov said in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
