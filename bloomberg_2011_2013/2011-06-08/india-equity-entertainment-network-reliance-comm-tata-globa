The following companies had unusual
price changes in  India  trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
and share prices are as of the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
101.33 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,394.29, the first decline
in three days. The BSE 200 Index retreated 0.4 percent to
2,288.63.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC IN) decreased 2.3 percent to
270.05 rupees, the lowest in two weeks. The country’s biggest
energy explorer and  GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL)   are in talks to
buy part of Exxon Mobil Corp.’s stake in  Kazakhstan ’s Kashagan
field, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
“The field has been a non-starter,” said Sandeep Randery, an
analyst with Brics Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “All that
investment would only make sense if production can start very
soon. Significant amounts of ONGC’s cash and resources could get
blocked if they go ahead with this large deal.” GAIL advanced
1.8 percent to 443.5 rupees.  Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM)   climbed 2.4 percent
to 94.25 rupees, the highest in more than a month.  Carlyle Group 
and TPG Capital are among companies in talks to buy a stake in
Reliance’s mobile-phone towers unit, three people with knowledge
of the matter said.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)   retreated 0.9 percent to
949.2 rupees. India’s most valuable company and its Canadian
partner Niko Resources Ltd. have told India’s oil ministry that
they are unable to raise gas output from one of their blocks
until 2014, Mint reported, citing minutes of a May 2 meeting.  Steel Strips Wheels Ltd. (SSW)   gained 2.1 percent to
293.4 rupees, the highest in more than a month. The automobile
equipment maker expects to sell 60,000 more wheels to Renault
SA’s plant in  Brazil  in the three months ending Sept. 30,
compared with an earlier estimate of 120,000, according to an
exchange filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
