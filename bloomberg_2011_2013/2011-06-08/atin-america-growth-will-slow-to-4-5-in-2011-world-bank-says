Latin American and Caribbean economic
growth will slow to 4.5 percent this year from an estimated 6
percent in 2010 as policy makers lift lending costs to control
inflation, the  World Bank  said in a  report  today.  Peru will lead growth at 6.9 percent in 2011 as  Brazil , the
region’s largest economy, expands 4.2 percent and Mexico climbs
4.4 percent, according to estimates for gross domestic product
at market prices. In an April report, the Washington-based
lender forecast  Latin America  and the Caribbean would grow 4
percent to 5 percent this year .  Countries face the risk of overheating because of higher
commodity prices and an increase in capital inflows, according
to today’s “Global Economic Prospects” report. Authorities
need to pursue a more frugal fiscal policy and ensure that
lending costs increase fast enough to control rising
inflationary pressures, the bank said.  “If policy makers in the region fail to rebuild policy
buffers, vulnerability to future crisis would be much
increased,” the report said. “If exit from the fiscal stimulus
is delayed, countries will rely more on monetary tightening to
keep inflation under control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
