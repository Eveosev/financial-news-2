Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.
founder and chairman Terry Gou told shareholders
the reasons for its lower profit margins last year are
“complicated” after revenue rose while gross margins declined.  “I admit, I didn’t do well,” Gou said at the Taipei-based
company’s annual meeting today. Hon Hai bought more equipment
and started moving its workforce to inland  China  last year, and
is learning from the experience, he said. The company will
continue to spend on research and development in new areas
such as electronics and optoelectronics, he said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
