Boston  Red Sox reliever Jonathan Papelbon got his 200th career save after appealing a three-game
suspension and undisclosed fine for inappropriate actions that
included making contact with an umpire.  Papelbon, who has 12 saves this season, pitched the ninth
inning last night in Boston’s 6-4 win over the  New York Yankees .
His appeal automatically delayed the start of his suspension.  The 30-year-old reliever came in contact with home plate
umpire Tony Randazzo in the top of the ninth inning during
Boston’s June 4 game against the visiting  Oakland Athletics  at
Fenway Park, Joe Garagiola Jr., baseball’s senior vice president
of standards and on-field operations, said in a statement.  Papelbon, who is 2-0 in 26 appearances this season, gave up
a four-run lead as the Athletics tied it at 7-7 and forced the
game into extra innings. Boston won 9-8 in the 14th inning.  Papelbon had a verbal exchange with Randazzo, rushed toward
the umpire, bumped Randazzo’s chest and was ejected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
