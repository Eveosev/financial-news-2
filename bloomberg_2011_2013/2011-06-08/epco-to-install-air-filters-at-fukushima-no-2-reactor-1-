Tokyo  Electric Power Co. will install
air filters to the lower radiation level in the No. 2 reactor
building of its Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, aiming to make
it safer to work in the damaged facility.  Tepco, as the utility is known, plans to complete
installing the air ventilation units with filters around June 11
and operate the system for about three days, Junichi Matsumoto,
a general manager at Tepco, said today at a news conference in
Tokyo. The company will then check radiation levels inside the
reactor building and open the facilityâ€™s double door to lower
humidity, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
