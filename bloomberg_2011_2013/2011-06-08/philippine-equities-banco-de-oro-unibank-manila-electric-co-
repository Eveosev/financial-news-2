Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the noon close in Manila.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 18.99, or 0.5
percent, to 4,255.44, snapping three days of losses.  Banco De Oro Unibank Inc. (BDO)  , the  Philippines ’
largest lender, dropped 1.7 percent to 57 pesos, the steepest
loss in two weeks. The lender is not interested in  Philippine
Bank of Communications (PBC)   and  Philippine National Bank (PNB) 
 and it’s “premature” to talk about other purchases,
President Nestor Tan said in an interview with ABS-CBN News
Channel today.  Philippine Bank of Communications slid 1.4 percent to 73
pesos. Philippine National Bank sank 3.3 percent to 59 pesos.  Manila Electric Co. (MER)   advanced 1.4 percent to 269
pesos, the highest close in more than four months. Prices of
electricity delivered by the Southeast Asian nation’s largest
power retailer will rise this month due to higher generation
charges, it said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
