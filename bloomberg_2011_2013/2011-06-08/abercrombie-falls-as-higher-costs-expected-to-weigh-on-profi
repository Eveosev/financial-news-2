Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) , the teen
retailer, fell 5.2 percent, the most in almost 10 months, after
its finance chief said rising costs would narrow second-quarter
profit margins.  “Second-quarter results won’t be good, but they won’t be
inconsistent with what we’ve previously said,” Chief Financial
Officer Jonathan Ramsden said today at an investor conference in
New York. “We do fully expect that this is a temporary timing
effect and we’ll resume a very healthy level of profit growth in
the back half of the year.”  Abercrombie, based in  New Albany ,  Ohio , said last month
that its gross margin this quarter will narrow from the previous
year. Ramsden today reiterated a previous forecast that same-
store sales in the second quarter will increase mid-single
digits as inventory was less than they would have liked.  The retailer, which also operates the Hollister chain, is
facing rising costs along with the rest of the apparel industry
as the price of cotton, oil and labor in Asia increase.
Abercrombie plans to raise prices in the U.S. in early
September, Ramsden said.  Abercrombie declined $3.62 to $66.28 at 4:15 p.m. in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading for the largest drop since
Aug. 17. The shares have gained 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
