Russian wildfires since the start of
the year have destroyed almost three times the forest and crop
areas damaged a year earlier, when the country experienced its
worst drought in half a century, the government said.  Wildfires have ravaged almost 635,568 hectares (1.57
million acres) of land since Jan. 1, up from about 216,374
hectares in the same period last year, the Emergency Ministry
said on its  website  today. About 44,641 hectares of mostly
forest area, including three fires in protected areas, are still
burning, the ministry said.  Wildfires, many ignited by smoldering peat fields, scorched
an area three times the size of  Luxembourg , killed more than 50
people and burned hundreds of private homes last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
