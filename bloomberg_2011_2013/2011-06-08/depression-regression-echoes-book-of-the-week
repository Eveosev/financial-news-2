"If the gov't continues its spending etc. it means ultimate inflation and crash. If the gov't stops spending, balances the budget, it means bad business during the period of adjustment but ultimately a sound recovery. Either way the outlook is not promising." That sounds like a pundit commenting on Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke 's speech yesterday. It was actually written on Nov. 22, 1937, in the diary of Benjamin Roth, a lawyer from Youngstown,  Ohio . Roth's experience of trying to ride the economic roller coaster is captured in " The Great Depression: A Diary ," a compilation of his journal entries edited by his son Daniel B. Roth and the journalist James Ledbetter. The volume was published two years ago, but it's worth picking up now because of the extent to which Roth's experience mirrors that of many business owners today. Roth was a small-time player, but he carefully recorded how his legal business was doing, showing what it's like to experience a depression from the weeds. When economists said the economy was improving, Roth would note that his clients were still struggling to pay him and new ones weren't coming on board. He described how pessimistic he and his acquaintances felt about the economy and about their future. Youngstown suffered acutely during the Depression because its economy depended on steel mills. Roth witnessed firsthand the Little Steel Strike of 1937, so-called not because the strike was small but because it occurred at plants that weren't owned by U.S. Steel, the countryâ€™s largest steel producer. He observed that labor unrest, particularly when it's supported by the government, makes bad times worse. In June 1937, he wrote: "The state and federal governments seem to support the labor unions and there has been a complete breakdown of law and order. Business is very quiet and everybody is hoping the strike will end soon." Roth's diary is also valuable as a cautionary tale: predicting the economic future isn't easy, he shows, and historical comparisons can be misleading. Roth made predictions about the economy in general and about particular stocks. In January 1937 he declared, "It seems to me that the time has come where we can formally and officially announce that the depression of 1929 has ended." The Dow fell 32.5 percent that year. In the same entry, he observed: "If you can once definitely place the new depression in its proper historical background then the rest is easy. History will repeat itself and the chart of the old depression will foretell pretty accurately the course of the new." Roth believed that the depression of the 1930s would follow the course of the depression of 1873. He thus concluded that the Great Depression had finally ended in early 1937 -- and he was blindsided by the "Roosevelt Recession." Historical comparisons can often be illuminating. But they can also distract us from what's at hand. (Nikolai Krylov is a contributor to the Echoes blog. The opinions expressed are his own.)
