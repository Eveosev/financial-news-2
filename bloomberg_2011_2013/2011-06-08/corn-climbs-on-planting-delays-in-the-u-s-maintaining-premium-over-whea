Corn rose for a second day in
 Chicago , maintaining the most-active contract’s premium over
wheat, on speculation the U.S. corn harvest will be smaller than
estimated because of late planting.  The corn crop faces “potential for shortfall” because of
the delays, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report on June 6.
Seeding may be as much as 2 million acres less than “original
intentions,” resulting in a decline of as much as 250 million
bushels, the bank said. Sowing was held up by wet weather in the
U.S., the world’s biggest exporter of the grain.  “While the corn planting, which was delayed for a long
time because of the extremely wet conditions, is now catching
up, the development of the plants still lags behind the long-
term average overall,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “Furthermore, the condition of the
plants is not as good as last year, though not worryingly.”  Corn for July delivery gained 2.25 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $7.3875 a bushel by 11:13 a.m. London time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The grain more than doubled in the past year and
yesterday closed at $7.365, while wheat settled at $7.3375 a
bushel. That’s the first time since 1984 that the most-active
corn contract became more expensive than wheat, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Supply-demand factors continue to support corn prices,”
 Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney, said by phone today. “When you look at
wheat, you obviously have favorable weather.”  Wheat for July delivery gained 3 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$7.3675 a bushel. The grain jumped 70 percent in the past year.
Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 2.50 euros, or 1.1 percent, to 228 euros ($334) a
metric ton.  Soybeans for July delivery slipped 3.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $13.905 a bushel in Chicago. The oilseed climbed 49
percent in the past year, helped by demand from  China , the
world’s largest importer of soybeans.  To contact the reporters on this story:
