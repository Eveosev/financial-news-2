Kenya’s government raised its  budget
deficit  forecast for the fiscal year through June 2012 as it
stepped up investment to improve infrastructure and enact a new
constitution, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said.  The fiscal deficit will widen to 184.3 billion shillings
($2.1 billion), Kenyatta said in his budget speech aired by the
state-run Kenya Broadcasting Corp. Excluding the rollover in
domestic debt and taking into account external debt redemptions,
the deficit will widen to 236.2 billion shillings, or 7.4
percent of gross domestic product, he said.  “The deficit is going up because this is a very
expansionary budget,” Elizabeth Irungu, investment manager at
Stanbic Investment Management Services, said by phone from
Nairobi. “The interest rate environment may remain a bit high,
and this could squeeze the private sector a bit.”  The budget deficit has expanded every year since at least
2005, the  International Monetary Fund  said in April, partly due
to stimulus spending during the global financial crisis and poor
 tax revenue . Faster inflation and the persistent fiscal deficits
have pushed up yields on government debt that represent 47.1
percent of gross domestic product, according to the IMF.  Three-month borrowing costs in Kenya, which rose to a nine-
year high of 8.8 percent at the last auction on June 2, may
climb higher, Kennedy Butiko, deputy head of treasury at
Nairobi-based  Bank of Africa , said on June 3.  Food Costs  Kenyatta estimated in March the budget deficit would narrow
to 152.6 billion shillings, or 5 percent of GDP, in 2011-2012,
from 162.5 billion shillings, or 6 percent of GDP, this year,
pointing to growth in the economy and improved  revenue  from
value-added tax.  Kenya’s inflation rate rose to a 25-month high of 13
percent in May, and the central bank predicts crop losses from
dry weather may push up the rate again later this year.  Kenyatta reiterated that he will remove the excise duty on
kerosene, a fuel used for cooking, following a 30 percent
reduction in April. The duty on wheat imports will also be
eliminated for one year, while the tariff on corn falls to 10
percent from 50 percent for six months to cushion Kenyans from
the rising costs, he said.  Investment of 10.2 billion shillings to expand irrigation
systems will help improve crop yields in the future, boosting
domestic food supplies and transforming Kenya into a net
exporter of crops, Kenyatta said.  Investment  Kenya plans to borrow 119.5 billion shillings on the local
 debt market  in 2011-2012, compared with an estimated 125 billion
shillings this fiscal year, as expenditure increases 15 percent
to 1.15 billion shillings, Kenyatta said. Spending is forecast
at 998.3 billion shillings in the current fiscal year, Planning
Minister Wycliffe Oparanya said on May 17.  Fiscal revenue will grow 15 percent to 787.6 billion
shillings in 2011-12, Kenyatta said.  Following two consecutive years of accelerating economic
growth, the  World Bank  forecasts expansion of 4.8 percent this
year, compared with 5.6 percent in 2010. Kenyatta today forecast
growth of 5.3 percent this year and 6.1 percent next.  Kenya is trying to implement changes required in a
constitution promulgated in August, such as creating a Supreme
Court and Senate and setting up 47 county-level governments
before elections in 2012. The government will spend 20.8 billion
shillings to enact the new charter, Kenyatta said.  Kenya ’s economy was battered by ethnic violence following a
disputed presidential election in 2007 that left 1,500 people
dead and drove another 300,000 from their homes.  “Our fiscal policy aims at gradually lowering our fiscal
deficit in order to ensure debt sustainability, while at the
same time taking care of the long-term development needs of the
country as well as implementation of the constitution,”
Kenyatta said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
