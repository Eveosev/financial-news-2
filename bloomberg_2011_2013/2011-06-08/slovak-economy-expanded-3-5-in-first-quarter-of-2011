The Slovak economy expanded 3.5
percent in the first quarter from the same period a year ago,
the Slovak Statistical Office said.  The result matches a 3.5 percent year-on-year expansion in
the previous three months and is also the same as the first-
quarter preliminary estimate released on May 13. On a quarterly
basis the economy advanced 1 percent, the Bratislava, Slovakia-
based  office  said today.  Slovakia is relying on foreign demand for its products,
including cars made by Volkswagen AG’s local unit, to drive
economic growth after a recession in 2009. Household demand has
remained subdued as the export-driven expansion has so far
failed to bring employment back to the pre-crisis level and a
raise in indirect taxes eroded the spending power of citizens.  “The data should show the economy was driven mainly by
exports, while consumer demand is muted,” Eduard Hagara, an
economist at ING Bank in Bratislava, Slovakia, said before the
release. “ Government spending  should have been weak because of
the austerity measures.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
