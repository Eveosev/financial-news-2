Orders to draw aluminum from London
Metal Exchange inventories climbed, nearing the highest level in
more than 13 years, on an increase in  California .  Total canceled warrants, as the orders are known, rose
6,775 metric tons to 529,725 tons, daily exchange figures
showed. A further increase of 50 tons would return warrants to
the highest level since at least October 1997, reached June 6.  Canceled warrants surged to 12,300 tons in  Long Beach ,
which stores 24,150 tons of the lightweight metal. That was the
first change for the location since March 11, 2010, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows. Total aluminum stockpiles fell for
a 10th day, declining 7,800 tons to 4.66 million tons.  Copper inventories rose 400 tons to 477,150 tons, remaining
at the highest level since May 27, 2010. They’re up 37 percent
from last year’s low on Dec. 10. Canceled warrants advanced 275
tons to 18,825 tons.  Lead and zinc inventories, near the highest levels since
1995, dropped. Stockpiles fell 150 tons to 323,250 tons for lead
and declined 225 tons to 866,625 tons for zinc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
