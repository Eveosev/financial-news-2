Japanese and Australian stock futures
fell after the  Federal Reserve  said the economy is slowing in
some areas of the U.S., boosting concern about the global
recovery.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, lost 0.7 percent from the closing price in
 Tokyo .  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , an automaker that earns about 70
percent of its revenue abroad, slid 0.7 percent after the yen
strengthened, cutting the earnings outlook for the exporter.
ADRs of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
Australia’s third-largest lender by market value, dropped 0.9
percent.  “The  U.S. economy  has so far been bolstered by
manufacturers, as consumption, employment and housing were not
good. But people have begun to see a dark cloud over the
manufacturing industry,” said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees
about $600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
Co.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,385 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,460
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,410 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index dropped 0.4 percent today.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. In New York yesterday, the index fell 0.4 percent,
sending the gauge to its longest losing streak since February
2009, as raw-material and financial shares slumped amid growing
concern the economy is slowing.  Yen Rises  The Federal Reserve yesterday said the economy expanded at
a “steady pace” in most of the U.S., while it weakened in four
of 12 regions as consumers contended with higher food and fuel
prices and shortages of parts reduced auto production.  The yen strengthened against all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts as concern about slower U.S. growth and about how
European leaders will deal with the region’s debt crisis boosted
demand for refuge currencies.  The Japanese currency appreciated to as high as 79.70
against the dollar last night in Tokyo, the strongest level
since May 5. Against the euro, the yen rose to 116.30 today from
117.44 at the close of  stock trading  yesterday. A stronger yen
cuts the value of overseas earnings at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  Copper Falls  ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No. 1 oil producer,
declined 0.5 percent after copper yesterday fell by the most in
a week on concern that demand will wane as the U.S. economy
falters. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
metals including copper and aluminum retreated 0.7 percent
yesterday, its first drop in four days.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 3.3 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 1.7 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 2.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.4 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the S&P 500
and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  In  Japan , the government is scheduled to release the
nation’s first-quarter gross domestic product report at 8:50 a.m.
local time in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
