Nigeria ’s former House of
Representatives speaker, Dimeji Bankole, pleaded not guilty to
charges of fraud at the Federal High Court in the capital,
Abuja, according to court proceedings.  Prosecutors charged Bankole, 41, with 16 counts of fraud in
connection with a 1 billion-naira ($6.4 million) graft
investigation. Judge David Okorowa ruled that he be remanded in
the custody of the  Economic and Financial Crimes Commission , the
anti-graft agency, and set a bail hearing for June 10.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, ranks 134 on a list of
178 nations on a corruption index compiled by Berlin-based graft
monitor,  Transparency International .  The West African country lost about $380 billion to
corruption between independence in 1960 and the end of military
rule in 1999, New York-based  Human Rights Watch  said in an
October 2007 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
