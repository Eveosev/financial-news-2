The euro climbed against the yen and
the dollar on speculation European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet will signal today that policy makers intend to
raise  interest rates  as soon as next month.  The 17-nation shared currency rose against all but two of
16 major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg after the ECB kept
its main rate unchanged at 1.25 percent, an outcome predicted in
a Bloomberg survey of economists. Trichet will hold a press
conference at 2:30 p.m. in  Frankfurt . The Dollar Index fell
before a U.S. report that economists said will show the trade
deficit widened to the most in 10 months.  New Zealand ’s currency
climbed to a record after the nation’s central bank said rates
will need to rise in the next two years.  “The no-change decision was a done-deal,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in
 London . “The crucial thing is whether Trichet’s language
suggests they’re going to hike in July.”  The euro rose 0.4 percent to 116.93 yen as of 12:50 p.m. in
London, and appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.4614. It reached
$1.4697 on June 7, the strongest level since May 5. The shared
currency climbed 0.6 percent to 1.22621 Swiss francs, which
weakened against all of its major peers.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six U.S. trading partners, declined 0.2 percent to
73.817. The pound traded at $1.6423, from $1.6404 yesterday.
Sterling gained 0.3 percent to 131.42 yen, and was at 88.98
pence per euro, from 88.90 yesterday, when it reached 89.76, the
weakest since May 5.  ECB ‘Hawkish’  “There’s some expectation that the ECB can stay quite
hawkish,” said  Henrik Gullberg , a London-based currency
strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, the world’s biggest foreign-
exchange trader. “There’s no independent factor driving euro-
franc. It’s more of a euro move ahead of the ECB, with no sign
of any involvement from the  Swiss National Bank .”  The BOE kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5
percent at today’s meeting, an outcome predicted by all 55
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The U.K. central bank will lift the rate by 30 basis points
over the next year, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index
based on swaps trading. The ECB will raise its main rate by 79
basis points in the same period, according to a separate Credit
Suisse index.  Trichet Signal  All 52 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the ECB
would leave its main interest rate unchanged. The central bank
raised borrowing costs in April for the first time in almost
three years, bringing the main refinancing rate to 1.25 percent.  “President Trichet is expected to signal a 0.25 point rate
hike at the July meeting by using the key phrase of “strong
vigilance” in describing the stance of the ECB in regard to the
inflation risks,”  Derek Halpenny , European head of currency
research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London, wrote
in an e-mailed report.  The 17-nation single currency plunged more than 2 percent 
to as low as $1.4510 on May 5 when the ECB left its rate at 1.25 
percent, wrong-footing some investors who had expected a faster 
move to combat higher prices.  The dollar has declined 4.3 percent against nine other
currencies of developed economies in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  New Zealand Rates  “The fact that the market seems to be focusing more on
worsening cyclical prospects for the U.S., that means we are due
for some further dollar weakening,” said  Todd Elmer , head of
Group of 10 currency strategy for Asia ex-Japan at Citigroup
Inc. in Singapore.  The U.S. trade gap expanded to $48.8 billion in April from
the $48.2 billion shortfall in March, according to the median of
75 estimates in a Bloomberg survey ahead of the Commerce
Department’s report today. The forecast April deficit would be
the largest since June 2010.  New Zealand’s dollar gained against all 16 of its most-
traded counterparts after  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand Governor
Alan Bollard signaled the central bank will lift interest rates.  The New Zealand currency rose 1.5 percent to a record 82.70
U.S. cents, and advanced 1.6 percent to 66.15 yen.  The central bank’s decision today to keep the benchmark
rate unchanged at 2.5 percent was predicted by all 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Swaps traders are betting the
central bank will increase the key rate by 63 basis points over
12 months, up from 56 basis points yesterday, a Credit Suisse
index showed.  Australia ’s dollar fell versus 13 of 16 major peers after a
report from the statistics bureau showed jobs increased by 7,800
in May from the previous month. That compared with the median
estimate for a 25,000 gain in a Bloomberg News survey of 25
economists. Full-time jobs declined 22,000.  “It’s still positive growth, slightly lower than the
market had expected,” said  Tony Morriss , head of interest-rates
research in Sydney at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
The Aussie “was a little bit weaker on the headline, but this
also provides confirmation perhaps the economy is going to be in
a slightly softer period of growth.”  Australia’s dollar fell to $1.0594, from $1.0623 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
