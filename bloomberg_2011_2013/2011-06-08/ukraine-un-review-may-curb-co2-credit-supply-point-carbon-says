A United Nations review of Ukraine’s
climate-protection efforts may delay supply of emission credits
and Kyoto permits from the eastern European nation, Point Carbon
said, citing a UN report.  Some parts of the nation’s emissions-verification system
were not working properly, according to the UN report cited on
the  website  of Point Carbon, a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp. The
UN findings could prevent Ukraine from selling Emissions
Reduction Units and Assigned Amount Units, according to the
Oslo-based news service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
