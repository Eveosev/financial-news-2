Facebook,  etc.  Here are the main winners and losers, by number of people
hired for each person leaving:  * Winners: Twitter (10.9), Facebook (8.1), Zynga (8.0),  LinkedIn (7.5), Groupon (3.9)
  * Losers: Intuit (1.2), Google (1.2), eBay (0.8), Microsoft  (0.4), Yahoo (0.3)       Click here  to see the story as it appeared on Bloomberg.com.
