The rand weakened against the dollar
for the second day this week as precious metals prices fell and
concern deepened that the global economic recovery is slowing,
damping demand for emerging-market assets.  The rand declined as much as 0.9 percent to 6.7738 per
dollar, and traded 0.5 percent weaker at 6.7451 at 4:23 p.m. in
Johannesburg. It depreciated 0.2 percent to 9.8690 per euro.  Emerging-markets stocks tumbled the most in two weeks after
the  World Bank  lowered the outlook for global economic growth
and said developing nations need to accelerate interest-rate
increases.  South Africa ’s benchmark stock index slipped as much
as 1.4 percent, led by mining companies including  Anglo American
Plc (AGL)  and BHP Billiton Ltd.  “Judging by the dismal performance of equity markets,
participants still seem hesitant to put on risk aggressively,”
 Michael Keenan , a Johannesburg-based analyst at Standard Bank
Group Ltd., said in a research note.  Gold for immediate delivery dropped as much as 0.7 percent
to $1,531.25 an ounce and platinum slipped by as much as 0.9
percent, snapping three days of gains. The two metals account
for 20 percent of South Africa’s exports  The rand extended its decline as the euro slid from a four-
week high versus the dollar after German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said bondholders must contribute a
“substantial” share of a second aid package for  Greece .  The rand often tracks the euro, the currency of most of
South Africa’s trade, with a statistical correlation of 0.837
over the past month. A value of 1 would mean they moved in lock
step. The euro slipped 0.5 percent versus the dollar.  Bonds declined, lifting yields from the lowest levels in
six months. The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 added 15 cents to
121.83 rand, boosting the yield 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.41 percent. The 6.75 percent notes due
2021 slipped 27 cents to 90.23 rand, driving the yield 4 basis
points higher to 8.22 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
