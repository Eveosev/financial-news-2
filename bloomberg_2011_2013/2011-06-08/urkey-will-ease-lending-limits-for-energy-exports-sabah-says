Turkey  will ease annual limits on
lending by banks to industries that contribute to exports and
reduce the current account deficit, Sabah said.  An overall government goal of 25 percent annual loan growth
wonâ€™t apply to the  energy industry  and some other businesses,
which could be raised to more than 30 percent, the Istanbul-
based newspaper reported. Meanwhile lending goals for house
purchases and  consumer spending  could be tightened, it said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
