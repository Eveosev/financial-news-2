Kulczyk Oil Ventures Inc. (KOV)  postponed
drilling in Syria’s Block 9 to the third quarter, according to
an executive at the exploration company controlled by Polish
billionaire Jan Kulczyk.  Exploration is due “to commence early in the third
quarter,” Jakub Korczak, vice president for  investor relations 
at the Warsaw-listed company, said in response to e-mailed
questions. He didn’t say whether the delay was due to violent
unrest that has engulfed Syria since mid-March.  Kulczyk was due to start drilling in the block in May,
according to an April 26 Syrian Oil Ministry statement citing
Chief Executive Officer Timothy Elliott.  The Calgary-based company won the right to explore the
block in 2007. It has a 45 percent net operating interest in the
10,032-square-kilometer (3,870-square-mile) site in northwest
Syria. MENA Hydrocarbons Inc. has 30 percent, Triton Petroleum
Pty Ltd. 20 percent and an “unrelated” party 5 percent,
according to Kulczyk’s  website .  Thirteen foreign companies, including Kulczyk,  Total SA (FP) ,
 Eni SpA (ENI) , China National Petroleum Corp., have submitted bids for
exploration rights in eight onshore blocks covering 40 percent
of Syria’s territory. Syria has also asked companies to submit
bids for three offshore concessions by Oct. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
