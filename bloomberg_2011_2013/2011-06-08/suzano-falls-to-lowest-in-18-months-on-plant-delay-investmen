Suzano Papel & Celulose SA slumped to
the lowest in 18 months in  Sao Paulo  trading after the company
said it plans to invest 3.5 billion reais ($2.2 billion) this
year and delayed the start of its Maranhao pulp plant.  The  Salvador , Brazil-based company fell 48 centavos, or 3.6
percent, to 13.02 reais at 12:10 p.m. local time and have
declined about 12 percent this year, compared with an 8.7
percent drop for Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  Suzano, a Brazilian pulp producer, said its Maranhao pulp
plant will now start in November 2013, according to comments
made by Chief Executive Officer Antonio Maciel Neto today in Sao
Paulo. It had previously said it would start in April 2013.  The company may sell farmland in Sao Paulo and a 17 percent
stake it owns in a hydroelectric dam in Minas Gerais state,
 Brazil , to help finance investments, Maciel said. Suzano hired
Bank of America Merrill Lynch as a financial adviser, he said.  “There are some concerns about debt leverage, because they
are investing now and delaying the start of the project,” said
 Pedro Galdi , an analyst with SLW Corretora in Sao Paulo.  The company also plans to sell up to 49 percent in fully
owned subsidiary Suzano Energia Renovavel SA, which has plans to
invest $800 million in three wood pellet plants that will be
used to produce electricity, he said.  “We may announce the deal in coming weeks,” he said,
declining to comment on how much the company may raise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
