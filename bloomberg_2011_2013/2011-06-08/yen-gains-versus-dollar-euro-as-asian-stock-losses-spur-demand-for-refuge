The yen rose against the dollar and
the  euro  as Asian stock declines prompted demand for the
Japanese currency as a refuge.  The yen was at 79.93 per dollar as of 10:11 a.m. in  Tokyo 
from 80.09 in  New York  yesterday, after rising to 79.85, the
strongest since May 5. It gained 0.4 percent to 117.23 per euro.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped as much as 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
