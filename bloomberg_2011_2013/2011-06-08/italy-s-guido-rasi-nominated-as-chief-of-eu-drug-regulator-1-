The European Medicines Agency’s
management board nominated Italian regulator Guido Rasi as the
new executive director.  The appointment will be confirmed after a hearing before
the European Parliament next month, the London-based EMA said
today in an e-mailed  statement . Rasi has led the Italian drug
regulatory agency since 2008 and has had a seat on the EMA’s
management board since last year, the EMA said.  The European Union’s drug regulator has been without a
permanent leader since Thomas Loenngren stepped down at the end
of last year after leading the agency for a decade. He became a
strategic adviser to NDA Group, a consulting firm that counsels
drugmakers on regulation and reimbursement. The EMA reviewed
Loenngren’s new role after consumer complaints that there was no
“cooling-off period” between jobs and found no conflict of
interest. The agency limited Loenngren’s activities.  Rasi has a degree in medicine and surgery, with a specialty
in internal medicine, allergology and clinical immunology from
the University of  Rome . He worked as a physician from 1978 to
1990, and then conducted research at the Institute for
Experimental Medicine of the National Research Council in Rome
until 2008, the EMA said.  Andreas Pott will continue as EMA’s acting executive
director until Rasi takes office, the agency said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
