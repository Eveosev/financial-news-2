Marine Harvest ASA (MHG) , the world’s
largest salmon farmer, said its losses from a volcanic eruption
in  Chile  will be “limited” because most of its production sites
are located a safe distance from the affected area.  Ash created from the June 4 eruption is forcing salmon
producers to move cages from the Los Rios region, according to
industry association SalmonChile.  Marine Harvest has only one hatchery and two fresh water
sites in the affected area and no seawater sites, Joergen Christiansen, a spokesman, said today. The Oslo-based company
has reduced its staffing at the sites and is preparing to move
smolt from one of the sites as a precautionary measure, he said.  “Even in a worst case scenario, where the ash clouds change
direction and this impacts one or more of the three locations,
financial effects are expected to be limited,” he said in an e-
mail reply to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
