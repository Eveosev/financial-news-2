Asia  fuel oil  rose to the highest in
a month as the product’s discount to crude narrowed. Naphtha
fell as the crack spread dropped to the lowest in 12 weeks.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil climbed $14, or 2.1
percent, to $675.50 a metric ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as
marine fuel, increased $14, or 2.2 percent, to $665.50. Each
variety rose to the highest since May 5.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 20 cents to
$4.83 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data. The difference is the
narrowest since March 16, indicating decreasing losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after rising to $10 a ton, Bloomberg data
showed. This viscosity spread has narrowed 2.5 percent so far
this week, meaning bunker prices are rising faster than higher-
quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  dropped $6,
or 0.6 percent, to $953 a ton, according to Bloomberg data.
Naphtha’s premium to London-traded  Brent crude  declined $2.16 to
$77.02. This crack spread was at the narrowest since March 17,
signaling eroding profit from making the petrochemical feedstock.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline in  Singapore  rose $2.35, or 2
percent, to $120.70 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Gasoline’s
premium to naphtha jumped $3.05 to $16.75, the highest since May
6, based on Bloomberg data. A widening reforming margin shows
it’s more profitable to turn naphtha into gasoline.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur increased 95
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $128.40 a barrel, according to
Bloomberg data. Jet fuel gained 90 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$129.05. Each product rose to the highest in a week.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude was up 16
cents at $20.17 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure
of refining profit, climbed for a second day.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising to
70 cents a barrel, PVM said. This regrade is down 6.7 percent so
far this week, indicating it’s less profitable to produce
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
