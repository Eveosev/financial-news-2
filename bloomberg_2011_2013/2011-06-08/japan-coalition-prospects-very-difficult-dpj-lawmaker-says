Hajime Ishii, a lawmaker in the
ruling  Democratic Party of Japan , comments on the likelihood of
a coalition government with the  Liberal Democratic Party  after
Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  survived no-confidence vote last week
by promising to step down at an unspecified time.  Ishii spoke today in an interview.  On the prospects of a DPJ-LDP coalition:  “It seems to be getting very difficult as those opposed
outnumber supporters by two to one” in the LDP. “This depends on
our partner, and we must come up with other ideas if they refuse.
But in general, a coalition is more efficient to work speedily
on reconstruction” from the March earthquake.”  On the timing of a DPJ leadership election:  “I don’t know. It may be at the end of August or September.
That depends on when Prime Minister Kan feels he’s fulfilled his
mission.”  On likely successors to Kan:  “There’s no decisive candidate. My mind is still blank.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
