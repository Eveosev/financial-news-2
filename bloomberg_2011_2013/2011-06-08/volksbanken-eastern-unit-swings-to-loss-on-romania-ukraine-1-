Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) ’s
eastern European unit, which is targeted by OAO Sberbank, swung
to a loss in 2010 as bad-debt provisions soared in its Romanian
unit and the company posted a writedown in Ukraine.  Volksbanken International AG had a net loss of 22.4 million
euros ($32.7 million) last year, compared with net income of
33.3 million euros a year earlier, according to the  annual
report  posted on the Vienna-based firm’s website today.  Risk provisions rose 36 percent to 238 million euros from
174.6 million euros, driven by  Romania , where they more than
doubled to 153.4 million euros, exceeding net interest income in
the country. The bank posted a 13 million-euro writedown on its
Ukraine business.  Volksbanken put VBI up for sale in December to raise money
to repay 1 billion euros of state capital it received in 2009,
and to reduce its riskier assets. The cooperative bank was among
the Austrian lenders hit hardest after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. Its Kommunalkredit AG unit was
nationalized to prevent a collapse in 2008, and the firm hasn’t
paid interest on state aid because of the losses.  Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref  confirmed
today that he is looking at VBI, which is active in 10 eastern
European countries, where the biggest share of business comes
from Romania.  “We are talking about a deal that would involve
Volksbanken International,” Gref told journalists at the  World
Economic Forum  on  Europe  and Central Asia in Vienna. He declined
to comment on details of the talks.  Volksbanken owns 51 percent of VBI, while  Germany ’s DZ Bank
and France’s Groupe BPCE each own 24.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
