China will implement additional
reforms on the current oil-product pricing mechanism and
introduce progressive power pricing for retail users this year,
 Securities Times  reported, citing the National Development
Reform Commission, without giving details.  The government introduced a mechanism in December 2008 that
tracks global crude costs and allows the NDRC, the countryâ€™s top
economic planner, to adjust fuel prices if oil fluctuates more
than 4 percent over 22 days.  Li Pumin, the Beijing-based spokesman at the NDRC, declined
to comment on the report when contacted by Bloomberg.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
