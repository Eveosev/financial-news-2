Dirk Nowitzki  ignored a fever to
score 10 fourth-quarter points as the  Dallas Mavericks  beat the
Miami Heat 86-83 to tie the National Basketball Association
Finals at two games apiece.  While Nowitzki rallied his team last night at American
Airlines Center in Dallas, Miami’s LeBron James was held to
eight points -- his lowest tally in more than four years.  Dallas trailed 74-65 early in the fourth quarter before
finishing with a 21-9 run. Nowitzki played with a sinus
infection and a 101-degree Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) fever
earlier in the day.  “The doctors tried to get it down, they couldn’t get it
under control,” Dallas teammate Tyson Chandler said in a
courtside television interview. “He was barely able to talk
(earlier in the day). Every time he tried to speak, he was
coughing up.”  Game 5 is tomorrow night in  Dallas . The series then will
shift back to Miami for Game 6 on June 12 and a decisive
seventh game, if necessary, on June 14.  Nowitzki, a right-hander who scored the decisive layup
with his injured left hand in Dallas’ Game 2 victory, scored 21
points and had 11 rebounds for the Mavericks. Chandler added 13
points and 16 rebounds.  “I didn’t really have a good night’s rest, so I was just
under the weather a little bit,” Nowitzki, speaking at a news
conference, said of his fever. “I’ll be alright on Thursday.
It’s a little sinus infection.”  Worst Since 2007  James, who moved to the Heat from the  Cleveland Cavaliers 
in July as a free agent, shot 3-for-11 and committed four
turnovers. He had nine rebounds and seven assists.  It was his lowest-scoring game since he had eight points
on Jan. 5, 2007, for the Cavaliers against the  Milwaukee Bucks .  The last time James had a lower tally was when he scored
three points on Dec. 29, 2004, at home against Houston, the
night before his 20th birthday. In 717 career NBA games,
including the playoffs, he’s scored less than eight points four
times, with the other occasions coming during the opening five
weeks of his rookie season in 2003-04.  Dwyane Wade  had 32 points to lead the Heat, who used a 13-
1 run that started late in the third quarter to take a nine-
point lead with 10:12 left in the game.  Nowitzki and the Mavericks, facing a 3-1 deficit in the
series, then took over. They held the Heat scoreless for more
than five minutes while retaking the lead.  Nowitzki’s layup with 14.4 seconds left made it 84-81.
Wade dunked to pull the Heat within a point with nine seconds
remaining. Jason Terry, who had 17 points off the bench for
Dallas, hit two free throws with 6.7 seconds to play for the
final points of the game.  “Unbelievable, that’s who he is,” Dallas teammate Jason Kidd said of Nowitzki. “Being sick and not feeling 100
percent, he wanted the ball down the stretch and he
delivered.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
