Canada ’s dollar fell after the
 Federal Reserve  said the economy slowed in four of 12 regions of
the U.S., the nation’s biggest trading partner.  The loonie, as the currency is also known for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, dropped earlier as Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the U.S. recovery is
“frustratingly slow.” The Canadian currency fell the most
against the yen today.  “Certainly things look pretty bleak in the U.S. right now,
so that’s not good for Canada,” said  Steve Butler , managing
director of foreign-exchange trading in Toronto at Bank of Nova
Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit. “We’ve seen Canada suffering when
the  U.S. economy  tanks, and that’s having an effect right now on
the currency.”  The Canadian currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 97.93
versus the greenback at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 97.45 yesterday.
The loonie earlier slid as much as 0.8 percent. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0211.  The loonie fell after the Fed’s  Beige Book  showed reports
from district banks “indicated that economic activity generally
continued to expand since the last report, though a few
districts indicated some deceleration.”  U.S. Direction  The U.S. economy slowed in four of 12 regions as consumers
contended with higher food and fuel prices while shortages of
parts reduced auto production, the Fed reported.  Bernanke said yesterday in Atlanta that the pace of U.S.
recovery warrants sustained monetary stimulus while predicting
that growth will gain speed in the second half of the year.  Canadian bonds rose, pushing the yield of two-year
securities down two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
1.43 percent. The 1.75 percent security that will expire in
March 2013 added 3 cents to C$100.55.  The government sold C$1.4 billion ($1.4 billion) of 30-year
debt, drawing an average yield of 3.515 percent. The government
received bids of C$3.3 billion for the 3.5 percent securities
maturing in December 2045.  The loonie pared its losses earlier today as crude oil rose
after Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Secretary
General Abdalla el-Badri said in Vienna there was no consensus
on the group’s production limits, which have remained unchanged
since 2009.  Oil Link  “The correlation between oil and the loonie is still
strong,” said Rahim Madhavji, president and head trader at
Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange in Toronto. “OPEC hasn’t changed
their production.  Oil prices  are higher, and that bodes well for
the loonie.”  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, increased
1.8 percent to $100.82 a barrel in  New York  after falling as
much as 1.1 percent.  Canada’s dollar gained the most against the Norwegian krone
among major currencies, increasing 0.7 percent. It dropped 0.7
percent to 81.58 yen. The loonie slid earlier today as much as
1.2 percent against the yen to 81.23, the lowest level since
March 18. Canada’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent against the
euro after earlier touching its lowest level since March 2010.  The European shared currency may weaken to C$1.3865 against
the loonie within the next two weeks and may fall to C$1.3570
during the next couple of months, according to a technical
analysis by Lloyds Banking Group Plc today.  Canada’s housing starts advanced to 183,600 in May from
178,700 in the previous month, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
reported today. The median forecast of 21 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an increase to 182,000 from a
previously reported 179,000.  The loonie weakened before a Statistics Canada report on
June 10 that’s forecast to show Canadian employers added 20,000
jobs to payrolls in May after a gain of 58,300 in the previous
month. The  unemployment rate  may have stayed at 7.6 percent.  “That’s actually going to be a big test for the market,”
said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at the online
trader GFT Forex in New York. “The employment report could have
a meaningful impact if it deviates a lot from expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
