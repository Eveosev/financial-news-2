The European Union may make it more
difficult for companies to bid for public procurement contracts
if they’re based in countries that don’t have reciprocal open
tendering arrangements, the Financial Times reported.  The European Commission, which is starting a consultation
process on the matter, said European companies don’t have access
to some emerging economies not covered by the  World Trade
Organization ’s government procurement agreement, according to
the newspaper.  It also pointed to difficulties faced in tendering for some
transport-related contracts in countries such as Japan and the
U.S., the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
