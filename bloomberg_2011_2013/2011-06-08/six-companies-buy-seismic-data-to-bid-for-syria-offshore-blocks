Total SA (FP) ,  Eni SpA (ENI)  and  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  are among six foreign companies that have bought
seismic data to bid for rights to explore offshore blocks in
Syria, Deputy Oil Minister Hassan Zainab said.  Four other foreign companies have expressed interest to buy
data for the production-sharing project, Zainab said today in a
telephone interview from the capital, Damascus.  Syria, struggling to halt a decline in crude oil output, is
seeking foreign investment in energy developments to help
stabilize oil output this year at a rate of 386,000 barrels a
day, Oil Minister Sufian Alao said Jan. 26. The country has
asked companies to submit bids for three offshore oil and gas
concessions by Oct. 5.  The Oil Ministry is also tendering eight onshore blocks
covering about 40 percent of the countryâ€™s territory.  Syria  is currently witnessing violent unrest across the
country, in the latest Middle Eastern country to be hit by a
wave of uprisings that ousted longtime rulers in Egypt and
Tunisia and sparked an armed conflict in Libya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
