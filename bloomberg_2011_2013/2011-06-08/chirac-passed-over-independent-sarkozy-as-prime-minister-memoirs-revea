Former French President  Jacques Chirac  didn’t pick  Nicolas Sarkozy  to be his prime minister
because he thought Sarkozy would undermine him, according to
Chirac’s memoirs.  Chirac, 78, overruled advisers pushing Sarkozy after re-
election in 2002 because he couldn’t expect “loyalty” and
“transparency” from Sarkozy, who is 23 years his junior,
according to extracts in the weekly  Le Nouvel Observateur .  “The risk would have been finding myself very quickly
confronted with a head of government ready to affirm his
independence, to dispute my prerogatives without even trying to
hide that he’s gunning to be my successor,” Chirac wrote.  Chirac had first-hand experience in such battles. He was
President Valery Giscard d’Estaing’s prime minister from 1974 to
1976 and challenged Giscard d’Estaing’s re-election bid in 1981.  Chirac chose Jean-Pierre Raffarin as his prime minister in
2002 and Dominique de Villepin in 2005. After Chirac completed
his second term, Sarkozy won the 2007 presidential elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
