Russian stocks climbed for a third
day as oil gained after OPEC ministers failed to agree
production quotas.  The 30-stock Micex Index advanced 0.1 percent to 1,664.83
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, erasing a loss of as much as
1.3 percent. OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, and OAO
Gazprom, the nation’s gas export monopoly, jumped 1.5 percent
and 1.2 percent, respectively. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
added 0.4 percent to 1,911.41.  Oil prices  rose in  New York  after ministers said there was
no consensus on OPEC’s production limits, which have remained
unchanged since the beginning of 2009. Crude jumped 1.4 percent
to $100.51 a barrel, reversing an earlier loss of as much as 1.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
