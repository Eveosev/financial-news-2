(Corrects original date of vote in second paragraph.)  Tunisia will delay its first election
since a revolt forced the president from power to Oct. 23,
Interim Prime Minister Beji Caid Essebsi said.  “We were faced with two choices: to hold elections on July
24 under the supervision of the Interior Ministry or to postpone
them to have a transparent and fair vote,” he told reporters in
Tunis today. The electoral committee asked for the delay “for
technical reasons.”  Most members of an electoral committee argued in May for a
delay because of problems such as voting cards and recruiting
and training of the necessary staff, according to the state-run
TAP news agency. Kamel Jandoubi, who heads the panel, had
proposed postponing the elections until Oct. 16, saying there
wasn’t enough time to ensure transparent elections.  The constituent assembly will draft a new constitution for
the North African nation, where protests forced President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee in January and inspired anti-
government demonstrations in Arab countries including Libya,
Bahrain, Syria, Yemen and  Egypt , where an uprising unseated
President  Hosni Mubarak .  To contact the reporters on this story:
