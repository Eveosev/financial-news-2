United Arab Emirates banks’ overall
deposits advanced by 2.1 percent in April from the previous
month, helping to further ease liquidity in the second-biggest
Arab economy.  Bank deposits increased to 1.13 trillion dirhams ($307
billion) from 1.11 trillion dirhams in March, according to data
posted on the  central bank’s  website today. Lending rose 0.6
percent to 1.05 trillion dirhams, which lowered the industry’s
loans-to-deposits ratio to 93.4 percent in April from 98.3
percent at the end of December, the data showed.  The increase in deposits “reflects the high  oil prices 
benefiting the economy,” Giyas Gokkent, group chief economist
at the  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , said in a telephone
interview. “We will probably continue to see relatively robust
deposit growth as long as oil prices remain firm.”  U.A.E. banks faced a shortage of deposits from the onset of
the global financial crisis in September 2008 as foreign
investors speculating on a revaluation of the currency pulled
out and credit markets froze. The loan-to-deposits ratio was 108
percent at the end of 2008.  It’s the third consecutive month that U.A.E. bank deposits
have recorded strong growth. The banking industry has already
added 78.7 billion dirhams in deposits this year compared with
67 billion dirhams in all of 2010.  Gokkent said he expects bank lending to improve in the
second half as “the system is very comfortable in terms of
liquidity and that liquidity has to go somewhere.”  Lending  Bank lending in the U.A.E. increased by 2.2 percent in the
four months through April after advancing by 1.3 percent in
2010. Bank credit rose at more than 30 percent annually between
2005 and 2008 as higher oil revenue spurred economic growth.  Non-performing loans as a percentage of gross lending
increased to 4.2 percent at the end of April from 4.1 percent at
the end of December, according to the central bank data.  The non-performing loans ratio of U.A.E. banks will
continue to climb through 2011 and should peak by the end of
year or by the first half of 2012, brokerage company Beltone
Financial said in a report today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
