U.S. stocks retreated, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the longest losing streak since
February 2009, as raw-material and financial shares slumped amid
growing concern the economy is slowing.  Visa Inc. (V)  and  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  fell at least 1.5 percent
after the  U.S. Senate  rejected a six-month delay of a Federal
Reserve rule capping debit-card swipe fees set by the companies.
 Ciena Corp. (CIEN) , the maker of network gear for the biggest U.S.
phone companies, tumbled 16 percent after reporting a wider-
than-estimated loss.  Gap Inc. (GPS)  slumped 2.4 percent after Barclays
Plc cut its recommendation for the largest U.S. apparel chain.  The S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent to 1,279.56 at 4 p.m. in New
York, dropping for a sixth day. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
slid 21.87 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,048.94 today.  “There’s enough fear,” said  Sara Zervos , a New York-based
portfolio manager at OppenheimerFunds Inc., which managed more
than $185 billion as of March 31. “We’re getting into that
negative side of things. This is a soft spot granted it’s been a
very significant string of bad data.”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the
U.S. recovery was “frustratingly slow.” From March 16, when
the  S&P 500  fell to its lowest level of the year, industries
less-tied to economic growth -- health care, consumer staples,
telecommunications and utilities -- have risen the most among 10
groups in the index.  ‘Steady Pace’  The Fed today said the economy expanded at a “steady
pace” in most of the U.S. while slowing in four of 12 regions
as consumers contended with higher food and fuel prices and
shortages of parts reduced auto production.  Reports from the Fed’s district banks “indicated that
economic activity generally continued to expand since the last
report, though a few districts indicated some deceleration,”
the Fed said today in its Beige Book survey of the economy in
 Washington .  Manufacturing “continued to expand in most parts of the
country,” while slowing in some areas.  Consumer spending  was
“mixed,” it said, while the job market improved “gradually
across most of the nation.”  Stocks extended a worldwide slump today after the  World
Bank  said global gross domestic product may expand 3.2 percent
this year, less than the 3.3 percent forecast in January. German
industrial production unexpectedly declined for the first time
in four months in April, the government said.  Visa Slumps  Visa dropped 3.9 percent to $76.71. MasterCard declined 1.5
percent to $270.  Senator  Richard Durbin  of  Illinois , the No. 2 Democrat in
the chamber, led the opposition to the delay amendment, which
was defeated in a 54-45 vote. The measure needed 60 votes for
approval. The central bank now has until July 21 to implement
the final rule on capping the fees, which accounted for more
than $16 billion in 2009, according to the Fed.  In December, the Fed proposed capping the swipe fees, or
 interchange , at 12 cents a transaction, replacing a formula that
averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price.  Ciena tumbled 16 percent to $20.29. The maker of network
gear for the biggest U.S. phone companies reported second-
quarter adjusted loss of 24 cents a share. On average, the
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated a loss of 11 cents. JDS
Uniphase Corp. fell 5.5 percent to $17.40.  Gap retreated 2.4 percent to $17.49. Barclays cut its
recommendation for the largest U.S. apparel chain to “equal
weight” from “overweight,” citing risks to sales improvement.  Raw Material Stocks  A gauge of raw material stocks in the S&P 500 sank 1
percent, the most within 10 groups, amid concern about slower
demand for metals.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) , the
largest publicly traded copper producer, dropped 1.9 percent to
$48.82. Alcoa Inc. decreased 1.8 percent to $15.41.  Energy shares gained the most among 10 S&P 500 industry
groups as crude oil rose. Secretary General Abdalla el-Badri of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said ministers
were unable to reach a decision on production quotas at their
meeting in Vienna today and will maintain their current output.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  added 1 percent to $80.76 for the third-
biggest gain in the Dow. The world’s largest energy company by
market value discovered the equivalent of 700 million barrels of
oil in three deep-water Gulf of Mexico wells.  Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG)  climbed 4.3 percent, the most in the
S&P 500, to $58.31. The Houston-based natural gas producer was
boosted to “buy” from “hold” at Canaccord Genuity, which
cited “significantly higher” expected output at Marcellus
Shale fields.  Economy-Tied  U.S. stocks whose earnings are most correlated to economic
growth may decline more than other industries as a gauge of the
shares nears its 200-day moving average, according to top-ranked
UBS AG technical analysts.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of 30 stocks, including
 Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and Ford Motor Co., may fall 3 percent to 980 if it
breaches major support levels at 1,024 and 1,010, according to a
report from UBS analysts Michael Riesner and Marc Muller
yesterday. The gauge closed at 1,035.20 yesterday.  “From a cyclical standpoint, the month of June should be
weak for risk assets,” Riesner and Muller wrote in the report.
“On a short-term basis, the U.S. market looks oversold and
could bounce later this week, but given the poor picture in
technical indicators and the increasing technical damage in key
sectors, new lows in financials and cyclicals/energy complex
sitting on key support, we are sticking to our cautious market
stance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
