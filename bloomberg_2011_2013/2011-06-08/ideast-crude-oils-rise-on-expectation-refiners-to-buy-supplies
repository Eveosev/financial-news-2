Middle East crude-oil grades climbed
on the expectation that refiners may purchase supplies to take
advantage of increases in processing profits.  Oman crude for immediate loading rose $1.97, or 1.8
percent, to $110.02 barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in August rose 1.8 percent to
$109.56. Murban increased 1.8 percent to $114.35.  Refiners in  Asia  may be purchasing more crude as gasoil’s
premium to Dubai crude, a measure of refining profit, has
climbed this month. The price difference, known as the crack
spread, fell 16 cents today to $19.85 a barrel, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based brokerage.
That’s up from $18.77 a month earlier.  Qatar lowered its May official prices, with Qatar Land
falling to $112.65 a barrel from $119.80 in April. Qatar Marine
dropped to $109.60 from $117. The Land grade’s premium to the
Dubai price published by Platts for last month rose to $4.27,
the most since July 2008, according to Bloomberg calculations.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July widened 20
cents to $6.68 a barrel, PVM said. The exchange for swaps for
August climbed 18 cents to $6.40 a barrel.  Oman futures for August delivery fell $1.05 to $109.70 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:52 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,048 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$109.80 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
