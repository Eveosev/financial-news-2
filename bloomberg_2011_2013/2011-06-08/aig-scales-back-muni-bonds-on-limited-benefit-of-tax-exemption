American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer recovering from record losses in 2008 and 2009, is
scaling back holdings of municipal bonds because of the limited
benefit of the  tax exemption  on the securities.  “We’ve been reducing our concentration in muni bonds,”
said Robert Schimek, chief financial officer of the Chartis
unit, at a conference today sponsored by Standard & Poor’s in
New York, where AIG is based. “Tax-exempt isn’t very valuable
for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
