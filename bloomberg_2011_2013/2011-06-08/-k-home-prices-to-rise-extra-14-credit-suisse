Hong Kong secondary home prices will
rise a further 14 percent by the end of the year, Credit Suisse
Group AG said, driven by a widening in negative real interest
rates, a weaker dollar and buying by mainland Chinese.  “While there is risk of rising mortgage rates, we believe
the extent is not likely to be significant enough to derail
demand,”  Cusson Leung  and Joyce Kwock, analysts at Credit
Suisse, wrote in today’s report. Transaction volumes in the
secondary market remain “relatively sluggish” due to lack of
available units for sale, they wrote.  The analysts said their top pick is  Sun Hung Kai Properties
Ltd. (16)  for its “quality” commercial properties, followed by
 Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1)  and Sino Land Co. Developers are
“suitable more for short-term trading given
the uncertainty in 2012 and 2013 for which visibility is very
low,” they wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
