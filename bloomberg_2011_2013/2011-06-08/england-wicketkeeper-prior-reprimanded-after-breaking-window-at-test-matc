England’s Matt Prior was reprimanded
by the  International Cricket Council  after accidentally smashing
a dressing-room window yesterday during the second Test against
 Sri Lanka .  Prior apologized after a woman spectator was cut by glass
in the incident at Lord’s in  London . It came when he returned to
the pavilion after being run out in a mix-up with  Ian Bell .  The wicketkeeper accepted the Level 1 charge for a breach
of the ICC code of conduct that covers “abuse of cricket
equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings
during an international match,” the ICC said in a release.  Prior’s actions caused the window to break, the ICC said
without being more specific. Yesterday, the England and Wales
Cricket Board said the damage occurred after he put his bat on a
ledge and the handle bounced into the window.  “It was clear that the damage he caused was purely
accidental and without malice,” Javagal Srinath of the elite
panel of ICC match referees said in the release. “It’s also
noted that he apologized to the ground authority for the
incident.”  Prior accepted the offense and the proposed sanction, so
there was no need to convene a formal hearing, the ICC said. He
could have been fined as much as 50 percent of his match fee and
won’t now have a financial penalty.  England  drew the match and leads the three-match series 1-
0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
