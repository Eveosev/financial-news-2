Mauritius’s sugar production will
probably decline 7.2 percent this year to its lowest level in 12
years because sugar cane ripened less than expected, the
Mauritius Chamber of Agriculture said.  Production is forecast at 420,000 metric tons compared with
452,473 tons a year earlier, Jocelyn Kwok, secretary-general of
the Port Louis-based chamber, said in an e-mailed statement
today. The output will be the lowest since 1999 when 373,294
tons was produced, according to data from the chamber.  “Climatic conditions favorable to cane ripening in May did
not have expected results,” Kwok said, following the first
meeting of the crop estimate coordinating committee today.  Sugar cane is the Indian Ocean island nation’s main crop,
making up about 80 percent of land under cultivation and 63
percent of agricultural exports, according to the Chamber of
Agriculture. Net revenue from sugar for the 2010 harvest was 6.1
billion rupees ($221 million), Jean-Noel Humbert, chief
executive officer of the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate said on Feb.
18.  About 4.2 million tons of sugar cane is expected to be
harvested this year compared with 4.36 million tons in 2010, the
chamber said. This year’s harvest will start next week and end
in the third week of December, Kwok said.  “Sugar content level might improve if climatic conditions
remain close to the normal up to the end of November,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
