Sony Corp. (6758)  has sent a notice to about
37,500 customers of its film unit saying some personal
information may have been stolen by hackers as  Japan â€™s biggest
exporter of consumer electronics copes with a string of attacks.  Unauthorized persons may have obtained information such as
names, addresses, dates of birth and phone numbers, Sony
Pictures Entertainment Inc. said today in a  statement  on its
website. The company is working with the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation to identify the intruders, it said.  The Tokyo-based company has been roiled by data intrusions
since April. Sony discovered the attack on June 2 after a group
calling itself LulzSec posted statements online saying it broke
into SonyPictures.com and downloaded unencrypted personal
information, including passwords, e-mail addresses and dates of
birth from 1 million user accounts.  Sony has hired experts to investigate the case and took
offline potentially affected databases, the company said today.  Shares of the company rose 0.3 percent to 2,038 yen at the
3 p.m. close of trading in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
