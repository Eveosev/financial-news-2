Rwanda’s government plans to almost
eliminate its  budget deficit  over the next three years, while
reducing dependence on foreign grants, said the Minister of
Finance and Economic Planning John Rwangombwa.  The shortfall will narrow to 0.3 percent of gross domestic
product from a targeted 2.4 percent in the fiscal year through
June 2012, the smallest in five years, Rwangombwa said in a
phone interview today from the capital, Kigali.  The government aims to boost the economy by investing in
infrastructure and agriculture, increasing  tax revenue  to 14.8
percent of GDP by 2014 from 13.6 percent. In the budget for next
year, 21.7 percent will go to infrastructure projects and 17.9
percent to agriculture, industry, trade and environmental
protection, the government said yesterday. Domestic borrowing
will fall to 21.6 billion francs ($36.1 million) from 81 billion
francs this year.  “We are targeting an increase in private borrowing,” the
minister said. “We want to be less active in the market because
we don’t want to crowd out the private sector.”  The government plans to earn 25 billion francs through
asset sales. Shares of MTN  Rwanda , a unit of MTN Group Ltd. of
 South Africa , will be offered this year, according to
yesterday’s statement, which did not list a date. On June 27,
Bank of Kigali Ltd., Rwanda’s biggest lender by assets, will
begin its initial public offering, which will include 20 percent
of the government’s stake in the company, bank officials said
May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
