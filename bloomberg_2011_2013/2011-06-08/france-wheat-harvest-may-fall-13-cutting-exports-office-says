France ’s soft-wheat harvest, the
European Union’s biggest, may slide 13 percent this year after
drought damaged plants, slashing exports in the 2011-12 season,
crops office FranceAgriMer said.  Soft-wheat production may fall to 30.9 million metric tons
from 35.6 million tons in 2010, Xavier Rousselin, head of arable
crops at FranceAgriMer, said at a meeting today in Montreuil-
sous-Bois outside Paris.  France leapfrogged  Russia  to become the world’s second-
largest wheat shipper in 2010-11 after a crop-wasting drought
prompted a Russian ban on grain exports. Now France’s driest
spring in 50 years may slash its shipments abroad by a third
just as Russia plans to lift its ban on July 1.  “There will probably be quite a major reduction of exports
to third countries,” Remi Haquin, cereals specialist at the
crops office, said at the meeting. “France will be able to
satisfy its domestic requirements without any problems. The
harvest will be down, but there’s no panic on the horizon.”  Milling wheat for November delivery rose as much as 3.6
percent to 233.50 euros ($340.42) a ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris,
the biggest advance since May 19.  World wheat output will be lower than previously expected,
the International Grains Council reported yesterday, forecasting
a crop of 663 million tons, 4 million tons below its outlook
from two weeks earlier on downgrades for France, Germany and the
U.K.  Drought Year Declines  The crops office is assuming average French soft-wheat
yields of 6.15 tons per hectare (2.47 acres), down 15 percent
from 7.24 tons per hectare in 2010, according to Rousselin.
FranceAgriMer studied yields in the drought years 1959, 1976 and
2003 to determine the potential yield decline, he said.  “Usually in drought years the yield slips 10 percent to 13
percent compared to the five-year average,” Rousselin said.  Based on the production forecast, overall soft-wheat
exports may fall to 13 million tons, Haquin said, compared with
19.72 million tons forecast for this year. France is expected to
ship less wheat to  Italy ,  Spain ,  Greece , Cyprus, Malta in
2011-12, with Bulgaria and  Romania  as well as Russia and Ukraine
making up for lower French exports, Rousselin said.  About 6 million tons of French soft wheat would be shipped
outside the EU, with Algeria the largest buyer, according to
Rousselin. That would be less than half the record exports in
the season ending June 30 and the lowest in four years.  Soft Wheat  The forecast for France’s soft-wheat exports outside the EU
in the 2010-11 season that ends this month was raised to 13.2
million tons, 400,000 tons more than estimated in May.  “We confirm the record exports,” Haquin said. “May has
been very strong. We think June will also be strong.”  About 12.5 million tons of soft wheat had been loaded in
French ports for export outside the EU at the end of May,
compared with 9 million tons at the same time a year ago,
according to the crops office.  Soft-wheat stockpiles in France at the end of June will be
2.12 million tons, compared with last month’s estimate of 2.2
million tons, FranceAgriMer said.  The barley crop is estimated at 8.7 million tons, with 3.4
million tons shipped to EU countries and 800,000 tons exported
outside the bloc, the crops office said. The 2010 barley harvest
amounted to 10.2 million tons.  FranceAgriMer assumes a barley yield of 5.61 tons a
hectare, compared with 6.4 tons a hectare last year, according
to Rousselin.  “We’ll have a lot less barley on the market, partly
because of lower carryover stocks and partly because of weaker
production,” he said.  Durum wheat production for 2011-12 is estimated at 1.9
million tons, down from 2.53 million tons harvested in 2010.  The U.S. is the biggest wheat exporter, followed by France,
 Australia  and  Canada  this season, according to data from the
International Grains Council and FranceAgriMer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
