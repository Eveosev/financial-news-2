Gold futures fell for the second
straight day on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  won’t ease
U.S. monetary policy further, boosting the dollar and eroding
the appeal of the precious metal as an alternative asset.  The greenback rose from a one-month low against a basket of
six major currencies. Yesterday, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
signaled that there won’t be a third round of so-called
quantitative easing, and gold dropped 0.2 percent.  “Bernanke wasn’t as bearish on the economy as everyone
thought he was going to be, and that was supportive for the
dollar,” said Frank Lesh, a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in
Chicago. “Gold is reacting to the dollar.”  Gold futures for August delivery fell $5.30, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,538.70 an ounce at 1:48 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The metal has gained 24 percent in the past
year, reaching a record $1,577.40 on May 2.  The Fed will end its second round of quantitative easing by
buying back $600 billion in Treasuries by the end of the month.  Gold’s losses were limited as higher energy costs spurred
inflation concerns. Crude-oil futures rose as much as 2.8
percent in New York.  “The  energy tax  is back on the table, and that will stop
any breaks in gold,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago.  Silver futures for July delivery fell 42.6 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $36.62 an ounce. The price has almost doubled in the
past 12 months.  Palladium futures for September delivery declined $3.80, or
0.5 percent, to $805.70 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for July delivery rose 50 cents to
$1,831.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
