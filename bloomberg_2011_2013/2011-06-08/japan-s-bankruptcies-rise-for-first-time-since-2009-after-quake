Japan ’s corporate bankruptcies rose
for the first time in almost two years after the nation’s record
earthquake.  Failures increased 4.9 percent from a year earlier to 1,071
cases, the first gain since July 2009, Tokyo Shoko Research said
in a report today in Tokyo. Some 64 cases were related to the
March 11 disaster, bringing the total number of quake-related
bankruptcies to 156, according to the report.  “Excessive restraint among consumers after the earthquake,
supply disruptions and a drastic change in environment were big
reasons for the increase in May,” Tokyo Shoko said in its
report. “While production at large companies is steadily
rebounding, the outlook for small and medium-sized companies
will probably be different.”  Japan’s economy slid into a recession after the temblor
that killed or left more than 23,000 missing caused a record
drop in industrial output and slides in consumer and corporate
sentiment. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict the
slump will continue into this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
