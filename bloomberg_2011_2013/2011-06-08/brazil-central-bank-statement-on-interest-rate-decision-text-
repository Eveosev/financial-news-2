Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “Giving continuity to the process of gradual adjustment of
monetary conditions, the monetary policy committee decided
unanimously to raise the Selic rate to 12.25 percent a year,
without a bias.  Taking into account the balance of inflation risks, the
still uncertain rhythm of the moderation of domestic activity,
as well as the complexity of the international environment, the
committee understands that, at the moment, the implementation of
adjustment in monetary conditions for a sufficiently long period
continues to be the most adequate strategy to ensure the
convergence of inflation to the target in 2012.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
