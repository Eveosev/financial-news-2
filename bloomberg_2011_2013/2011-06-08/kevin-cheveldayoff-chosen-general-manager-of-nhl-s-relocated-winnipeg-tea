Kevin Cheveldayoff was selected as
general manager of the former Atlanta Thrashers team that’s
moving to Winnipeg for the 2011-12 National Hockey League
season.  Cheveldayoff was appointed three days after the team fired
former Thrashers General Manger Rick Dudley.  Cheveldayoff, a native of Blaine Lake, Saskatchewan, spent
the past two seasons as assistant general manager of the NHL’s
Chicago Blackhawks after 12 seasons as general manager of the
American Hockey League’s Chicago Wolves.  A first-round draft pick of the  New York Islanders  in 1998,
Cheveldayoff played four seasons of junior hockey with the
Brandon, Manitoba, Wheat Kings before beginning his professional
career.  The Thrashers are headed to  Canada  after being sold last
month to Winnipeg, Manitoba-based True North Sports &
Entertainment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
