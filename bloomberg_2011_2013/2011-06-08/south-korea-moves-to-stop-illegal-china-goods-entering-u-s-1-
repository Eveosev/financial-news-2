South Korea  is taking steps to
prevent goods from nations including  North Korea  and China from
entering the European Union and U.S. at lower rates under
pending free-trade agreements.  The Korean customs service hired 157 officers to
investigate and stop illegal shipments from outside the nation
from passing through Korea en route to the EU and U.S., the
South Korean embassy in  Washington  said yesterday in a
statement. The officers will inspect “high-risk cargoes, which
include all textile shipments,” and the customs bureau will
increase its cooperation with trading partners, according to the
statement.  AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in an interview last
week that he’s concerned the free-trade pact with South Korea
will cost the U.S. jobs by making the Asian nation a funnel for
cheap goods from  China  and North Korea.  “The textile and apparel industry, which is the primary
victim of illegal trans-shipment, believes that the primary
perpetrator of it is China,” John Brinkley, a spokesman for the
South Korean embassy, said today in an interview.  The South Korea trade accord is forecast by the U.S.
International Trade Commission to boost U.S. goods exports by
$11 billion a year when it takes full effect, making it the
biggest U.S. free-trade pact since the North American Free Trade
Agreement in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
