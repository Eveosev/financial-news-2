Fighting intensified as artillery
fire was used in the fourth day of clashes between the northern
and Southern Sudanese armies in northern  Sudan ’s only oil-
producing state.  About 7,000 civilians are taking refuge in the vicinity of
the UN compound in Kadugli, the capital of Southern Kordofan
state, where heavy clashes were reported today, United Nations
spokesman Kouider Zerrouk said by phone from Khartoum, Sudan’s
capital.  Fighting on the border between northern Sudan and oil-rich
Southern Sudan, which is due to become independent on July 9,
has raised concern about a resumption of the two-decade civil
war that ended with a 2005  peace agreement .  Sudanese Army spokesman Al-Sawarmi Khaled didn’t answer
calls seeking comment. Yesterday, he said there was no more
fighting in the state after clashes on June 5 killed one
Sudanese army soldier and injured seven others.  The bodies of four policemen and two civilians were brought
to the Kadugli police hospital after fighting yesterday, Zerrouk
said yesterday.  -- Editors: Terry Atlas, Bob Drummond  To contact the reporter on this story:
