L&M Arts  gallery is serving  Andy Warhol ’s Campbell’s Soup in a form less familiar than the
realistic red-and-white images of 1962’s Pop Art landmark.  The  Manhattan  gallery has assembled 12 of the 20 existing
multicolored Campbell’s soup cans that Warhol painted in 1965.
This is the first time they have been the sole focus of an
exhibition, and the effect is remarkable.  By adding more colors to the palette, the artist
transformed his original silkscreens and in the process stepped
beyond his roots in the graphic arts. Greens, yellows, purples
and blues fill the labels, and no one hue is identical to
another in the 12 joyful paintings.  Warhol’s sharp use of color combinations gives each a
painterly uniqueness where once they were only distinguished by
flavor.  Two works are for sale and prices will be provided upon
request. A colored Campbell’s soup can  fetched  $3.4 million at
Phillips de Pury & Co. in 2007.  “Andy Warhol: Colored Campbell’s Soup Cans” is at 45 E.
78th St. through June 11. Information: +1-212-861-0020;

“Avedon: Artists” at Manhattan’s  Gagosian Gallery .  The 1979 print, from an edition of 10, hangs alongside
other portraits of artists, among them Duchamp, Picasso and de
Kooning.  A blond dog lovingly looks up at Robert Frank, with his paw
resting on the photographer’s arm. Andy Warhol shows off the
scars left in his midrift by Valerie Solanas.  Also on view at Gagosian’s uptown space is a show revolving
around the discovery, last year, of Arshile Gorky’s “Untitled
(Pastoral),” a 1947 painting that had been hidden behind
“Pastoral” -- on the same stretcher -- for more than 60 years.
The exhibition focuses on the artist’s last year of life, before
he committed suicide in 1948.  The challenging canvas is covered in dark brushstrokes and
features an evil-looking face in the top left area with only one
blue eye. In “Pastoral,” a green dog seems to be slowly
stepping out of Gorky’s original yellow universe.  Not to be missed is “The Limit,” a gray abstract canvas
decorated with patterns made of colors and thin lines, last
shown in a retrospective at the  Guggenheim Museum  almost 30
years ago.  Some works are for sale, although the gallery won’t
disclose prices. “Avedon: Artists” and “Arshile Gorky: 1947”
are at 980 Madison Ave. through July 8 and July 1, respectively.

depicts a once-powerful animal as broken and mutilated, Chaim Soutine purchased a massive beef carcass and installed it in his
studio.  The macabre “Flayed Beef” is on view at the  Helly Nahmad 
gallery as part of the show “Soutine/Bacon.” According to its
curators, the series of beef paintings, one of which was sold
for 7.8 million pounds ($13.8 million) in 2006, might have been
what pushed Bacon to become an artist.  The show draws together and relates the works of two
masters who died almost 50 years apart.  “Soutine and Bacon is a natural combination,” said Esti
Dunow, co-curator of the show. “But people didn’t pick it up.”  The most striking resemblances can be seen in two
portraits, Soutine’s 1923 “Portrait of the Sculptor, Oscar
Miestchaninoff” and Bacon’s 1960 “Seated Figure.” Both
portray suspicious-looking characters with shifty eyes, dark
blue clothing against a darker background, and a distinctively
colorful nose with a marked bend to one side.  “Soutine/Bacon,” a noncommercial show, is at 975 Madison
Ave. through June 18. Information: +1-212-879-2075;
