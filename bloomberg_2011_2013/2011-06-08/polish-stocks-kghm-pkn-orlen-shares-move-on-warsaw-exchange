Poland’s WIG20 Index fell 13.14, or
0.5 percent, to 2,882.73 at 10:34 a.m. in Warsaw, heading for a
second daily decline this week.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, fell 2.1 zloty, or 1.1 percent, to
190.6 zloty, heading for the steepest drop in almost a week.
Copper slid as concern about an economic slowdown grew after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  didn’t signal fresh
stimulus even as the recovery slows.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company,
retreated 0.5 zloty, or 0.9 percent, to 52.75 zloty. Oil fell
amid speculation OPEC will increase production quotas when it
meets in Vienna even as U.S. gasoline demand weakens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
