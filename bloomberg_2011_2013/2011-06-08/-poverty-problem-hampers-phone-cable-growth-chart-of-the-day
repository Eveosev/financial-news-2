U.S. telecommunication and cable
companies have a “poverty problem,” according to Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  Many lower-income consumers are shunning smartphones,
broadband Internet access and pay-television services because
they can’t afford them, Moffett wrote in a May 25 report.
Instead, they are turning to cheaper alternatives.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows this by tracking the percentage
of new mobile-phone customers each quarter who sign up for pre-
paid  service , rather than more expensive monthly contracts. The
chart is based on data from the report and isn’t adjusted for
subscriber losses.  During the first quarter, a record 64.5 percent of the
wireless industry’s new customers opted for pre-paid service,
according to the data. The percentage almost doubled from its
low in 2006.  “The bottom end of the market is trading down as quickly
as the top end is trading up,” Moffett wrote. Cable and
satellite TV companies are in a similar position, the report
said, as their price increases make Netflix Inc.’s video-
streaming service and other “good enough” options more
appealing.  These developments will hamper the ability of phone and
pay-TV companies to add customers and to raise prices further,
Moffett wrote. He added: “Investors in both sectors will face a
stiff headwind if either trend worsens.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
