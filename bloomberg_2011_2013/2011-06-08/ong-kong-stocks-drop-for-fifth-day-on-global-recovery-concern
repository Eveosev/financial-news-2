Hong Kong stocks fell, sending the
Hang Seng Index to its lowest close in almost 12 weeks, after
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  gave no hint of a
new round of economic stimulus even as the recovery slows.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the world’s biggest supplier of toys to
retailers that gets most of its revenue from the U.S., lost 3.6
percent. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the metal,
sank 1 percent as copper prices dropped in London.  HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest bank, declined 1.1 percent after agreeing
to pay $62.5 million to settle a group lawsuit in  New York .
     The Hang Seng Index fell 0.9 percent to 22,661.63, its
lowest close since March 18, extending a 0.7 percent decline
last week. All four industry groups on the gauge dropped. The
index dropped 0.4 percent yesterday amid concern that
accelerating inflation may prompt  China  to raise  interest rates .
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’ H
shares lost 1.1 percent to 12,581.55 today.  “Bernanke’s somber outlook combined with no hint of
further quantitative easing being used as a policy response
near-term have led to a negative tone in markets,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1 billion in global equities
at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “In a glass-half-empty
environment, investors globally are adopting a much more
cautious stance.”  Futures on the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.4
percent today. In New York yesterday, the index fell for a fifth
day, sliding 0.1 percent to its lowest level since March 18. Fed
Chairman Bernanke yesterday said the central bank should
maintain record monetary stimulus to boost an “uneven” and
“frustratingly slow” economic recovery.  Asset Purchases  “While Bernanke’s comments suggest that the Fed will be
there to provide liquidity, I don’t think that his assessment is
that there will be additional asset purchases,” said Kevin Caron, a market strategist in Florham Park, New Jersey, at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co, which has $115 billion in client assets.
“The market reacted to the absence of direct commitment to
quantitative easing.”  Recent data showing weakness in the  U.S. economy , including
an increase in the  unemployment rate  to 9.1 percent in May, has
raised the odds the Fed will hold the benchmark interest rate
near zero into next year.  Li & Fung slumped 3.6 percent to HK$16.82.  Esprit Holdings
Ltd. (330) , the Hong Kong-based clothier that gets the bulk of its
revenue outside Asia, retreated 1.3 percent to HK$27.75.  Foxconn
International Holdings Ltd. (2038) , the world’s largest contract maker
of mobile phones, dropped 2.1 percent to HK$3.82.  Copper, HSBC  Jiangxi Copper lost 1 percent to HK$25.95 as copper prices
fell as much as 1.5 percent in London today.  “Economic data has been soft so markets seemed to be
hoping Bernanke would offer a bit more,” said Shane Oliver,
head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
manages about $98 billion in Sydney.  HSBC fell 1.1 percent to HK$79.40. The lender agreed to pay
$62.5 million to settle a group lawsuit in New York, filed by
investors in a fund that lost money in Bernard Madoff’s fraud
while the bank acted as custodian.  Among stocks that climbed today, Aluminum Corp. of China
Ltd., the nation’s largest producer of the metal, gained 4.2
percent to HK$6.77 after its parent took over five rare-earth
companies in Jiangsu province to boost capacity. The company,
also known as Chalco, is increasing its rare-earth capacity as
prices for the metals used in  wind turbines  and hybrid cars gain.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  lost 1.3 percent to 22,560
today. The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong
Kong stock options, jumped 5.1 percent to 19.04, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 5.5 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
