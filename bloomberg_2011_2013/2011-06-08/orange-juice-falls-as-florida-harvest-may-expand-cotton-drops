Orange-juice  futures fell for the
second straight day on concern that the U.S. government may
boost its forecast of fruit production in  Florida . Cotton
gained.  Florida, the world’s largest orange grower after  Brazil ,
may produce 140 million boxes of the fruit in the harvest season
that lasts through this month, up 4.7 percent from a year
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said May 11. The
USDA is scheduled to update its forecast tomorrow.  “People may be a little worried about a bearish
surprise,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price
Futures Group Inc. in Chicago. “There probably are some ideas
that the boxes can come up a little bit. I think they could
drop, actually, a little bit, but conditions are said to be
generally good for the crops, and there’s no hurricane out there
or anything like that.”  Orange juice for July delivery declined 2 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $1.82 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . Yesterday, the commodity dropped 1.1 percent.
Prices have gained 32 percent in the past year.  A Bloomberg News survey of five analysts signaled the USDA
may reduce its May forecast to 139.7 million boxes, based on the
average estimate. The harvest began in October.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.22 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $1.3015 a pound on ICE, the first gain in four
sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
