The inclusion of the aviation sector
in the European Union’s emissions trading system is a
“practical example” of steps that need to be made to prevent
global warming, EU Climate Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard  said.  “‘If we had only done that for European airlines only it
wouldn’t be fair,” Hedegaard told a seminar in Brussels today.
“Everyone agrees the aviation sector has to contribute.”  The EU decided in 2008 that external and internal flights
should be covered by its emissions trading system, known as the
ETS, after airline discharges in  Europe  doubled over two
decades. The European legislation offers an option to exclude
incoming flights from a non-EU country if the nation implements
“equivalent” measures to cut pollution from aviation.  China ’s airline association said earlier this week that it
“totally opposes” the EU’s plan to expand its cap-and-trade
program from 2012 to include airlines, adding the initiative may
prompt trade conflict.  The EU’s ETS, including more than 11,000 utilities and
manufacturers, requires companies that exceed their carbon-
dioxide emissions quotas to pay a fine or buy spare permits from
businesses that emit less.  Airlines will be the second-largest sector in the system,
after power generators. Under the legislation, 82 percent of the
emission allowances making up the airline-industry cap will be
allocated for free, and 15 percent will be auctioned. The
remaining 3 percent will be put into a special reserve for later
distribution to fast-growing airlines and new entrants.  To contact the reporters on this story:
