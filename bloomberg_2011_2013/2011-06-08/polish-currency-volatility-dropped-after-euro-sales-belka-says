The zloty’s  exchange rate  has become
less volatile since the Polish government began buying zloty
with euros received in European Union subsidies, central bank
Governor Marek Belka said.  The Finance Ministry announced in April it would exchange
as much as 14 billion euros ($20.4 billion) in EU funds on the
market this year to reduce fluctuations in the exchange rate and
absorb liquidity on the  interbank market .  “The scale of over-liquidity has been limited,” Belka
said today at a press conference in Warsaw after the  Monetary
Policy Council raise interest rates for the fourth time this
year. It’s still “too early” to assess the effect of the euro-
sale policy, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
