Tropical storm Adrian lingers just
shy of hurricane strength as it churns its way through the
eastern  Pacific Ocean  off the coast of  Mexico , where it has
prompted warnings.  The storm, with maximum winds of 70 miles per hour (113
kilometers), is moving northwest at about 9 mph, according to
the U.S.  National Hurricane Center . It is 260 miles south-
southwest of Acapulco, Mexico, the center said in a statement
released just before 2 p.m. West Coast time.  “Additional strengthening is likely during the next couple
of days and Adrian could become a hurricane later today,” the
center said. “On the forecast track, Adrian is expected to
remain offshore of the coast of Mexico. However, any deviation
to the right of the forecast track could bring tropical storm
conditions to the coast.”  A tropical storm watch extends from  Acapulco  westward to
Punta San Telmo, meaning winds of at least 39 mph are possible
within 48 hours, according to the hurricane center. Adrian will
reach hurricane status when winds hit 74 mph.  Tropical storm force winds extend 85 miles from Adrian’s
center and swells form the system are expected to reach the
Mexican coast later today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
