U.K. stocks climbed as commodity and
media stocks rallied, the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly
narrowed amid record exports and  consumer confidence  improved.  Weir Group Plc (WEIR)  rallied 4.8 percent after  RBC Capital
Markets  raised its price estimate on the shares and reiterated
it as one of the broker’s top picks.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  led raw-
material shares higher, as a gauge of the industry’s shares
rebounded from a two-week low.  WPP Plc (WPP) , the world’s biggest
advertising company, and  Pearson Plc (PSON)  both gained more than 1
percent.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 47.45, or 0.8 percent,
to 5,856.34 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , rebounding from a
two-month low. Still, the measure has fallen 2.2 percent this
month as reports on U.S. employment and factory orders added to
concern that the economy is faltering. The FTSE All-Share Index
advanced 0.7 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased
1.1 percent.  “The slightly better than expected  U.S. trade deficit 
number finally provided something positive for investors to
latch on to,” said Kishan Mandalia, a sales trader at City
Index Ltd. in London. “Valuations for commodity related stocks
are particularly compelling.”  The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday after European markets
closed that the economy expanded at a “steady pace” in most of
the U.S., while slowing in 4 of 12 regions as consumers
contended with higher food and fuel prices and shortages of
parts reduced car production.  ‘Frustratingly Slow’  The report underscores Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s statement
on June 7 that the central bank should maintain record stimulus
to bolster a “frustratingly slow” recovery. He predicted that
the economy will pick up in the second half of the year as
energy prices moderate and factory disruptions ease as suppliers
of parts from  Japan  recover from an earthquake and tsunami.  Data today showed the U.S. trade deficit narrowed in April
reflecting a plunge in auto and oil imports combined with record
exports. The gap shrank 6.7 percent to $43.7 billion, the lowest
since December, the Commerce Department said.  A separate report showed U.S. applications for unemployment
insurance payments unexpectedly rose last week. Jobless claims
increased by 1,000 to 427,000 in the week ended June 4,
according to the Labor Department.  The  European Central Bank  kept its benchmark interest rate
at 1.25 percent today, while the  Bank of England  held its key
rate at 0.5 percent and left its bond-purchase program unchanged
at 200 billion pounds ($328 billion).  ECB, BOE  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled the bank intends
to raise interest rates next month, saying “strong vigilance”
is warranted to contain inflation.  Weir Group gained 4.8 percent to 2,050 pence as RBS
analysts raised earnings-per-share estimate for 2013 for the
company 12 percent.  Anglo American rose 2.2 percent to 2,988.5 pence. Rio Tinto
Group Plc gained 1.3 percent to 4,199.5 pence. The FTSE 350
Mining Index rebounded from its lowest level in two weeks.  WPP gained 1.5 percent to 734.5 pence. Pearson gained 2.1
percent to 1,161 pence.  Lookers Plc (LOOK)  jumped 3.6 percent to 72.5 pence, extending
yesterday’s 9.4 percent rally. The U.K. car dealership owner and
auto-parts supplier said it received an “indicative” proposal
for a possible cash offer of 80 pence a share from a group of
investors led by Jack Petchey.  BowLeven, Home Retail  BowLeven Plc (BLVN)  rallied 11 percent to 325.25 pence after
reporting its first oil flow test in the Douala Basin offshore
Cameroon.  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME)  tumbled 14 percent to 174.5 pence,
dragging retailers lower, as sales at Argos stores open at least
a year fell.  Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS)  slumped 8.9 percent to 17.58 pence.  JD Sports Fashion Plc (JD/)  declined 4.1 percent to 939 pence
after saying its “cautious” outlook is unchanged based on
downward pressures in  consumer spending  and an increase in VAT.  Halfords Group Plc (HFD)  bucked the trend in retailers, rallying
2 percent to 405.9 pence. The U.K. seller of car parts and
bicycles said profit rose 11 percent last year as improved
margins offset a squeeze on consumer spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
