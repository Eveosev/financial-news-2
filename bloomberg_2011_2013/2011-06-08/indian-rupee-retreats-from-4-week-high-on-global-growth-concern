India ’s rupee fell, snapping a nine-
day advance, on concern global investors will slow purchases of
emerging-market assets after the  Federal Reserve  signaled the
world’s largest economy remains weak.  The currency retreated from a four-week high after Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday record monetary stimulus
is still needed to boost a “frustratingly slow” recovery in
the  U.S. economy . Funds based abroad sold $95 million more
Indian shares than they bought on June 6 after adding to
holdings for five days, according to data published yesterday by
the Securities & Exchange Board of India.  “The Bernanke comment has renewed concern about global
growth and soured sentiment across the financial market,” said
Vikas Babu, a Mumbai-based currency trader at state-owned  Andhra
Bank . “Equities are lower and there’s more demand for the
dollar’s safety.”  The Indian currency weakened 0.04 percent to 44.70 per
dollar as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index
fell 0.6 percent as shares across Asia declined.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.34 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.30
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
