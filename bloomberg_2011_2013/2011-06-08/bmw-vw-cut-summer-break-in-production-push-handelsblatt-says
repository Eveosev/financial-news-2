Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  will cut some workersâ€™ summer vacations this year
to meet demand for cars,  Handelsblatt  reported.  BMW will cut the summer break in two factories to one week
from four weeks, the newspaper said in an e-mailed preview of an
article to be published tomorrow. Some 2,500 VW workers have
agreed to postpone their holidays to boost production through
what would usually be vacation weeks in July and August, the
newspaper said, citing the company.  Daimler AG (DAI)  is negotiating with workers for additional
Saturday shifts, Handelsblatt said, citing a company
spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
