Tony Clement, head of  Canada ’s
Treasury Board and minister responsible for the country’s civil
service, told a group of government executives they should seek
“transformative” change of the bureaucracy to reduce costs,
including considering the introduction of user fees.  Clement, who is leading efforts to find C$4 billion ($4
billion) in annual savings, said the government spending review
will focus on grants, capital investments and payments to state-
owned businesses in addition to wages and salaries.  “This is the first time in 15 years that government has
conducted a review of this scope,” Clement said at a conference
in Ottawa organized by the Association of Professional
Executives of the Public Service of Canada, or  APEX . Departments
should develop a “full range of options” in “administrative
and program efficiencies, business consolidation and user
fees,” he said.  The review is central to Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s
plan to erase the federal government’s deficit by 2014. The
government aims to shave off 5 percent of the government’s C$80
billion in annual discretionary spending.  Clement said some of the changes may require legislative
changes.  “This is not just a cost-cutting exercise,” Clement said.
“This is an exciting chance to bring about transformative
change in the way we serve Canadians.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
