Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is on track to extend its
lead as the biggest electronic chip buyer after overtaking
 Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  last year on surging demand for its iPhone
and iPad tablet and waning personal computer sales growth.  Apple has bought $17.5 billion worth of chips for its
devices in 2010, compared with $9.7 billion the previous year,
El Segundo, California-based IHS ISuppli said in a  report  today.
Apple’s semiconductor spending is expected to exceed Hewlett-
Packard’s outlay by $7.5 billion this year, up from $2.4 billion
in 2010.  Cupertino, California-based Apple said this week it has
sold more than 25 million iPads since the device went on sale in
April, 2010 demonstrating the demand for a device that can offer
many of the features of a laptop in a smaller and lighter
format. Hewlett-Packard, based in  Palo Alto ,  California , on May
17 said consumer PC sales dropped 23 percent last quarter, and
cut its annual sales forecast by $1 billion.  Hewlett-Packard fell 21 cents to $35.36 at 4 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange, and Apple rose 20 cents to $332.24 in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
