BAE Systems Plc (BA/) ,  Europe ’s largest
defense contractor and a maker of the Eurofighter warplane, is
selling its remaining stake in  Saab AB (SAABB)  for about $253 million,
ending a 13-year investment in the Swedish weapons maker.  BAE is selling 11.2 million shares at 139.5 kronor apiece,
according to a term sheet sent to clients and obtained by
Bloomberg News. The sale completes BAE’s gradual withdrawal from
Saab, maker of the Gripen fighter plane.  BAE first bought 35 percent of Saab in 1998 for 3.5 billion
kronor, about $450 million at the time, when the two were
already partners in selling the Gripen. BAE began unwinding its
Saab holdings in 2005, selling 13.2 million shares as it sought
to reorganize international ventures to fund acquisitions in the
U.S. Last year, it sold half its 20.5 percent stake to Investor
AB, the Wallenberg family’s publicly traded holding company,
saying it would sell the rest later.  “They decided some years ago that Saab is redundant for
them, as they shifted their focus to the U.S.,” said Zafar Kahn, an analyst at  Societe Generale  in London, who has a
“hold” rating on BAE stock. “It is a good time to sell since
the Saab share price recovered.”  Saab shares have gained 35 percent in the past 12 months.
Today they plunged as much as 8.2 percent to 136.8 kronor, the
biggest intraday drop since October. They traded at 137.3 kronor
as of 11:27 a.m. in Stockholm, giving Saab a market value of 15
billion kronor ($2.43 billion). BAE shares declined 1 percent to
320 pence.  BAE, which also makes Astute submarines and Excalibur
artillery shells, is targeting new arms markets and building up
civil-industry sales as Britain shrinks its  defense budget . BAE
is already among the top 10 defense contractors in the U.S.  An external BAE spokeswoman declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
