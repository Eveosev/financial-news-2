European Union carbon permits fell to
their lowest since May 27, dropping as much as 0.7 percent to
16.53 euros a metric ton.  They were at 16.58 euros a ton at 8:32 a.m. local time on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  “The price action looks horrid” since the contract
reached 18.18 euros on May 31, the highest for two-and-a-half
years, said Brett Genus, a broker at OTC Europe LLP. The
contract may fall to 16.05 euros, he said today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
