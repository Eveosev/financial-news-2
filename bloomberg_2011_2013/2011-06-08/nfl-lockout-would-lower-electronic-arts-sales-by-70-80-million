Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS)  said gross
revenue may fall by $70 million to $80 million if the National
Football League lockout of its players leads to a canceled
season.  The company is working closely with the league and the NFL
Players Association to minimize the potential impact of a
lockout-shortened season on sales of NFL-related games, Peter Moore, president of EA Sports, told Bloomberg Television
yesterday.  Electronic Arts sells “Madden NFL,” which is updated each
year with team and player performance data ahead of the new
professional football season. Moore’s estimate was lower than
the potential loss of as much as $165 million reported yesterday
by the New York Post, which cited analyst estimates.  “You do get concerned that the attention of sports fans
goes elsewhere,” Moore said. “People not only get disenchanted,
they get angry.”  Moore estimated the lockout’s impact could be as much as 35
percent. Analyst  Michael Pachter  at Wedbush Morgan Securities
put the potential drop as high as 50 percent of “Madden NFL”
sales.  Electronic Arts fell 63 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $22.72
yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained
39 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
