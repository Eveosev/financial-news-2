American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out U.S. insurer, said low interest rates have
prompted the company to curb the sale of some policies that
could require claims payments years into the future.  AIG has cut back because the New York-based firm can’t find
assets that will earn enough at current rates to make the sales
worthwhile, Robert Schimek, chief financial officer of AIG’s
Chartis unit, said today in New York at a conference sponsored
by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
