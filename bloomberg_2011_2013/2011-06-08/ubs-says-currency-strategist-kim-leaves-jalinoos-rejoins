(Corrects transposition error on name in the first and last
paragraphs.)  UBS AG, the world’s third largest
foreign-exchange trader, said currency strategist Brian Kim has
left and strategist Shahab Jalinoos rejoined the firm.  Kim, who was based in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , left to
“pursue an external opportunity” after three years at the
company, spokeswoman Allison Chin-Leong said in an e-mail. Kim’s
successor will be announced soon, she said.  Jalinoos is a managing director and senior foreign exchange
strategist for the Americas. He was a currency analyst at UBS
from 2000 to 2003 and will move from  Singapore  to the firm’s
Stamford office. He most recently worked as a proprietary trader
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Artradis, a hedge fund,
Chin-Leong wrote.  Kim couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  UBS, based in Zurich, ranked behind Deutsche Bank AG and
Barclays Plc in an annual currency trading survey by Euromoney
Institutional Investor Plc that was released last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
