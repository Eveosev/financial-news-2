America Movil  SAB, Latin America’s
largest wireless carrier, won a ruling by  New York ’s highest
court rejecting a claim of $900 million in damages in a dispute
with former shareholders of its Ecuador unit.  Centro Empresarial Cempresa SA and Conecel Holding Ltd.
can’t claim they were fraudulently induced to sell their stake
in the Ecuador unit because a 2003 agreement released America
Movil from such a claim, the New York Court of Appeals in Albany
ruled yesterday. The unanimous decision upholds a ruling from an
intermediate appeals court.  The decision ends the legal proceedings initiated by the
plaintiffs, Mexico City-based America Movil said yesterday in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
