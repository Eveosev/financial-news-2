BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3) , the world’s
largest poultry exporter, dropped to the lowest in four months
and is leading losses in the Bovespa index amid concerns
 Brazil ’s antitrust regulator will add restrictions to approve
the planned acquisition of Sadia SA.  Brasil Foods  fell 1.11 reais, or 4 percent, to 26.79 reais
at 12:13 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading, the lowest since Feb. 15,
after earlier dropping as much as 4.3 percent.  “There are concerns Brasil Foods may be forced to sell or
license brands,” Max Bueno, an analyst with Spinelli Corretora,
said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo today. He rates the
stock “hold.”  Brazil’s antitrust agency, known as Cade, will vote today
on the $3.81 billion purchase of Sadia by Brasil Foods, formerly
known as Perdigao SA. Brasil Foods must allow competition by a
third company and may also have to share gains with customers,
Cade’s attorney general said in a May 10 report.  The transaction that created Sao Paulo-based Brasil Foods
in July 2009 is the second-largest among 166 industry deals
totaling $24.2 billion worldwide since that year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazilian beef producer JBS SA’s
September 2009 purchase of Bertin SA is the largest at $6.31
billion, the data show.  Cade earlier today rejected a proposal to delay the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
