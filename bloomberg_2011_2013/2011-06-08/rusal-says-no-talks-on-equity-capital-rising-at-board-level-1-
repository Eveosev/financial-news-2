United Co. Rusal, the Russian
aluminum producer seeking to refinance $11.3 billion of debt,
said it hasn’t discussed equity capital raising at board level.  The company “is in the process of discussing a debt-
refinancing facility with its banking syndicate,” Moscow-based
Rusal said today in an e-mailed statement. “The proposed
refinancing facility does not require any issuance of equity or
sale of assets as a condition precedent.”  A potential share sale is being discussed by major
shareholders rather than at board level, two people with
knowledge of the talks said June 6.  Russian billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , who holds 17 percent
of Rusal, said the board is considering selling 7 percent to 10
percent in new shares, RIA Novosti reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
