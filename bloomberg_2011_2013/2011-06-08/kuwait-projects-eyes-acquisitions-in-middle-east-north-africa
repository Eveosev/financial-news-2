Kuwait Projects Co., the country’s
biggest privately owned investment company, is eyeing
acquisitions in the  Middle East  and North Africa, Chief
Financial Officer Pinak Maitra said.  “We’re always looking at acquisitions, if the price is
right, we’d do something,” Maitra said in an interview today in
Dubai. “We deal in financial services, media, technology,
industrial and real estate, so it would be in one of those
sectors.”  Kipco, as the company is known, has holdings in more than
60 companies and conducts business in 26 countries. The company
repaid its $350 million five-year bond on April 12 and it
doesn’t have any immediate financing needs and plans to pay all
outstanding debt on time, Maitra said.  The company may sell bonds “if spreads get tighter,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
