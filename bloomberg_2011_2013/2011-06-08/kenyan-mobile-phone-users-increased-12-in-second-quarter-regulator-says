Kenya ’s mobile-phone users rose at
the fastest pace in at least a year in the three months through
December as the cost of calls fell, the  Communications
Commission of Kenya  said today.  Users increased 12 percent to 25 million in the quarter,
the Nairobi-based commission said on its website. The average
fee for calls within a network dropped from 2.67 shillings
($0.03) per minute from 3.92 shillings, and for calls between
networks it fell to 3.47 shillings from 5.10 shillings, it said.  Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki ordered a halt to further cuts
in mobile-phone call tariffs after companies including  Safaricom
Ltd. (SAFCOM)  and Telkom Kenya Ltd. opposed the reductions,  Business
Daily  reported today.  Kibaki ordered that interconnection fees, the rates
operators charge each other to connect voice calls across
networks, remain at current levels, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said, citing a May 18 communication by the president. The
Communications Commission ratified the decision, it said.  Airtel Kenya Ltd., controlled by Delhi-based  Bharti Airtel
Ltd. (BHARTI) , and Telkom Kenya Ltd., a unit of  France Telecom SA (FTE) ,
increased their market share during the quarter to 15 percent
and 8.5 percent respectively. Safaricom Ltd., the biggest
operator, fell to 63 percent from 70 percent. Telkom Kenya added
973,000 new customers followed by Airtel with 815,000 and
Safaricom with 737,000.  The number of internet users grew to about 10.2 million
from 8.7 million in the previous quarter, while fixed-line
telephone customers declined 0.8 percent, the commission said.
“Growth in the data market is attributed to three mobile
operators having rolled out their 3G services,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
