Large-scale land deals in  Africa  have
been characterized by a lack of transparency, making it
impossible to assess their benefits, according to Festus Mogae,
the former president of Botswana.  “We are concerned that it appears in many of the cases,
the governments have not consulted adequately,” Mogae told
reporters in Lisbon yesterday, ahead of the African Development
Bank’s annual general meeting. “We are in favor of foreign
investment. It should come on appropriate terms.”  About 45 million hectares (111 million acres) of farmland
were leased in the two years through 2009, compared with an
average pre-2008 rate of 4 million hectares a year, the  World
Bank  said in a report released in September. More than 70
percent of the deals were in Africa, most of them in  Sudan ,
Mozambique, Liberia, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Madagascar.  The rush to secure African agricultural land, which has
been led by  China , India, Malaysia and Indonesia, has been
driven by concerns about food security and rising grain prices.  “Private foreign investors are leasing or buying or
borrowing huge chunks of agricultural land in African
countries,” said Mogae, who is the chairman of the Coalition
for Dialogue for Africa, a lobby group. “The terms and
conditions under which these investments are made” need to be
disclosed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
