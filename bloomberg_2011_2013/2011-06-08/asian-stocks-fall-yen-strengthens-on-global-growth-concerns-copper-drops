Oil surged after OPEC kept production
quotas unchanged. Stocks slumped, giving the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index its longest losing streak since 2009, and the yen
strengthened against all 16 major peers as an unexpected
slowdown in German industrial production reinforced concern that
the global economy is slowing.  Crude futures jumped 1.7 percent to $100.74 a barrel, while
the  S&P 500  fell 0.4 percent to 1,279.56 at 4 p.m. in New York,
posing a sixth straight loss. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid
1.1 percent, falling for a sixth straight day, and German 10-
year bond yields dropped four basis points to 3.05 percent. The
yen gained 1.4 percent against the Norwegian krone and 1.1
percent versus the euro.  Ministers from OPEC, which is responsible for 40 percent of
global oil supply, were unable to reach a decision on changing
production limits that have been in place since 2009, the
group’s Secretary General Abdalla el-Badri said. The report on
 Germany ’s economy followed Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  saying the U.S. recovery was “frustratingly slow.”
The  World Bank  said global gross domestic product may expand 3.2
percent this year, less than a 3.3 percent forecast in January.  “Energy, oil are getting some play after the OPEC
meeting,” said  Eric Green , a  money manager  at Penn Capital
Management in Philadelphia, which oversees $6.5 billion.
“You’re just seeing a listless market with a couple of areas
that look attractive. People who have wanted to sell have sold.
There’s a lack of buyers because there’s not a lot of good news
in the short run. We don’t expect the economic data to start
picking up dramatically. The macro-news has not been positive.”  Oil, Copper, Gold  Oil’s rebound drove up the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of commodities, which climbed 0.6 percent. Copper futures
for July delivery slumped 1 percent to $4.1085 a pound. Gold for
August delivery declined 0.3 percent to $1,538.70 an ounce.
Through yesterday, crude climbed 8.4 percent in 2011, beating
the 3 percent return with dividends from the S&P 500 and the 4.1
percent advance by the CRB measure.  Mohammad Aliabadi, the acting Iranian oil minister and
current OPEC president, said the group will maintain current
output for now. A Gulf delegate said yesterday that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was going to raise
quotas. A U.S. government report showed a bigger-than-forecast
supply drop.  “It was expected that they would raise the quotas, so this
comes as a bit of a shock,” said  Rick Mueller , a principal with
ESAI Energy, LLC in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  Defensive Industries  The S&P 500 swung between a loss of 0.6 percent and a gain
of 0.2 percent. In the stock market, investors are buying shares
considered havens during an economic slowdown. While the S&P 500
has risen 2.3 percent from its year-to-date low on March 16,
industries less-tied to growth -- health care, consumer staples,
telecommunications and utilities -- have risen the most among 10
groups in the index.  U.S. stocks whose earnings are most correlated to economic
growth may decline more than other industries as a gauge of the
shares nears its 200-day moving average, according to top-ranked
UBS AG technical analysts. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of
30 stocks may fall 3 percent to 980 if it falls below 1,024 and
1,010, according to a report from UBS analysts Michael Riesner
and Marc Muller yesterday. The gauge closed at 1,035.20
yesterday, when its 200-day moving average was 1,013.44.  ‘Weak’ Month  “From a cyclical standpoint, the month of June should be
weak for risk assets,” Riesner and Muller wrote in the report.
“On a short-term basis, the U.S. market looks oversold and
could bounce later this week, but given the poor picture in
technical indicators and the increasing technical damage in key
sectors, new lows in financials and cyclicals/energy complex
sitting on key support, we are sticking to our cautious market
stance.”  Treasuries rose as Bernanke’s comments yesterday that
record monetary stimulus is still needed bolstered demand at
today’s $21 billion auction of 10-year notes.  Yields on 10-year notes fell to 2.93 percent, the lowest
level this year, as investors sought refuge after the Fed’s
Beige Book survey showed the economy “generally” grew while
slowing in some areas. The extra yield investors demand to hold
30-year bonds instead of 2-year debt was almost the highest
since March on speculation interest rates will stay low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
