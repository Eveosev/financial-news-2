Sony Corp. (6758) , which last month posted
its widest annual loss since 1995, is proposing an 11 percent
cut in salary and bonuses for board members and corporate
executive officers in the year ended in March.  Sony seeks shareholder approval to pay a combined 1.1
billion yen ($14 million) to 24 executives, including Chairman
Howard Stringer, for that fiscal year, according to an
invitation for the annual general meeting posted on its website.
That compares with the 1.24 billion yen paid to 20 executives a
year earlier, according to the company. The numbers don’t
include  stock options , according to the document.  Japan’s biggest consumer electronics exporter last month
posted a third consecutive annual loss for the first time since
its listing in 1958. Sony also forecast a lower profit than
analysts’ estimated this fiscal year as it seeks to recover from
 Japan ’s record earthquake and copes with hacker attacks against
its online networks.  Sony rose 0.3 percent to 2,038 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in  Tokyo  today.  The annual general meeting is scheduled for June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
