AS Estonian Air, the countryâ€™s
national carrier, needs to more than double its fleet to
survive,  Postimees  said, citing Chief Executive Officer Tero
Taskila.  The Tallinn-based company, which is 90 percent state-owned,
needs at least 15 airplanes compared with seven now, the
newspaper cited Taskila as saying at a conference in the
Estonian capital today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
