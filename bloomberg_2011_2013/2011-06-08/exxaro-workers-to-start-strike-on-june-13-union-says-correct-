Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  miners will
start a strike on June 13 over a plan to cut jobs, the  National
Union of Mineworkers  said.  “Over 7,000 workers at Exxaro will down tools,” the union
said today in an e-mailed statement. “The dispute is over the
possible retrenchment of 300 workers across Exxaro operations.”  Exxaro, the largest coal supplier to  South Africa ’s state
power utility Eskom Holdings Ltd., said in November that a
planned reorganization to improve productivity and reduce costs
may lead to as many as 300 job losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
