Treasuries rose, pushing two-year
note yields to the lowest level this year, as Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday record monetary stimulus
is still needed to support the economic recovery.  Yields on 10-year notes fell before the government’s
$21 billion auction of the securities today and a $13 billion
offering of 30-year securities tomorrow. The extra yield
investors demand to hold long bonds instead of 2-year debt was
almost the highest since March on speculation interest rates
will stay low.  “Bernanke’s comments were supportive of the bullish trend
in yields as he pointed out that the economy will continue to
languish unless we see marked improvement on the jobs front,”
said  Martin Mitchell , head government bond trader in Baltimore
at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., a brokerage firm. “There was no
endorsement of QE3, which is putting pressure on risk assets and
supporting Treasuries.”  Yields on 10-year notes dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.97 percent at 11:07 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
securities maturing in May 2021 increased 1/4, or $2.50 per
$1,000 face amount, to 101 11/32.  The 10-year note yields fell on June 1 to 2.94 percent, the
lowest level since Dec. 7. Two-year note yields slid one basis
point to 0.40 percent after touching 0.39 percent, the lowest
since Nov. 9. The yields on 30-year bonds dropped four basis
points to 4.22 percent.  The difference in yield between 2- and 30-year debt was
3.83 percentage points after increasing yesterday to 3.85
percentage points, the widest since March.  ‘Frustratingly Slow’  Record monetary stimulus is still needed to boost a
“frustratingly slow” recovery, said Bernanke at an Atlanta
conference yesterday, reiterating that a rise in inflation is
likely to prove temporary.  “The economy is still producing at levels well below its
potential; consequently, accommodative monetary policies are
still needed,” Bernanke said. At the same time, the Fed “will
take whatever actions are necessary to keep inflation well
controlled,” he said.  Bernanke said growth is likely to pick up in the second
half of the year as fuel prices recede and disruptions of parts
supplies dissipate with factories in  Japan  recovering from the
March earthquake and tsunami. The Fed’s Beige Book regional
survey of the economy is due at 2 p.m. New York time.  World Bank ’s View  The World Bank lowered its growth forecast for the global
economy this year to 3.2 percent from a January estimate of 3.3
percent to reflect Japan’s earthquake and political unrest in
the  Middle East  and North Africa. The Washington-based lender
left unchanged a prediction for a global rebound in growth to
3.6 percent in 2012.  Futures contracts showed the likelihood of an increase in
the fed funds target by the March 2012 meeting fell to 22
percent, from 38 percent odds a month ago. The target rate for
overnight lending between banks has been zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008.  The Fed purchased $6.4 billion of debt maturing from July
2015 to May 2016 today under its $600 billion second round of
quantitative easing. The program, also known as QE2, expires
this month.  U.S. employers added less than a third of the number of
workers in May than economists forecast, and the jobless rate
rose to 9.1 percent from 9 percent, the Labor Department
reported last week.  ‘Another Dip’  “The general sense in the market is that there’s going to
be another dip in economic growth and that we might need QE3,”
said Mark Schofield, head of interest-rate strategy at Citigroup
Inc. in  London . “You’ve got a lot of people talking up every
reason to buy. We’re still in the camp that the economy is
recovering and that yields are headed higher toward the end of
the year.”  Treasury 10-year notes yielded less than the annual
inflation rate of 3.2 percent, with the so-called real yield at
negative 19 basis points.  “We’re getting a bit stretched given that the real yield
is quite negative,” said Warren Potter, a bond portfolio
manager at AMP Capital Investors in Wellington,  New Zealand .
Yields can remain near current levels “until we see some
firming in the economic data,” he said.  Before today’s 10-year note sale, the securities yielded
2.98 percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 3.21 percent
at the previous offering May 11. Investors bid for 3 times the
amount on offer last month, compared with an average of 3.09 for
the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, the category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 47.2 percent of the notes last
month, versus the 10-sale average of 51.1 percent.  Yesterday’s $32 billion auction of three-year notes drew
the highest demand from a group including foreign central banks
since January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
