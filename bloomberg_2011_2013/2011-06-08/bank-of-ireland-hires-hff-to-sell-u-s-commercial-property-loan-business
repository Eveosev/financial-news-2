Bank of Ireland Plc, the nation’s
largest bank, hired broker Holliday Fenoglio Fowler LP to advise
it on the sale of its U.S. commercial property business, which
includes $1.5 billion in performing loans.  The loans are primarily on commercial real estate in  New
York , Boston and Washington, Dublin-based Bank of Ireland said
in an e-mailed statement today. The U.S. property unit is
“high-performing and profitable,” Paul McDonnell, head of the
bank’s global property finance book, said in the statement.  Irish regulators directed Bank of Ireland in March to
reduce its loan portfolio by about  30 billion euros  ($43.7
billion), or 26 percent, by the end of 2013. Chief Executive
Officer Richie Boucher said in April that the company will sell
about 10 billion euros of loans and wind down other holdings.  Holliday Fenoglio is owned by Pittsburgh-based  HFF Inc. (HF)   To contact the reporter on this story:
