The  New York Yankees  placed right-
handed reliever Joba Chamberlain on the 15-day disabled list
with a strained flexor muscle in his pitching arm, the latest
blow to a bullpen already missing the injured Rafael Soriano.  Manager  Joe Girardi  told reporters before tonight’s home
game against the Boston Red Sox that Chamberlain, 25, will take
10-14 days off before starting a throwing program.  “He has been getting treatment on the elbow for a couple
of weeks,” Girardi said. “His stuff has been good and he
pitched well, which led us to believe he was good.”  The Yankees called up pitcher Amauri Sanit from minor-
league Scranton to fill Chamberlain’s roster spot.  “I played long toss and assumed it was going to be fine,”
said Chamberlain, who is 2-0 with a 2.83 earned run average in
27 relief appearances this season. “And then as soon as I was
done it became tight and it was something that was a little bit
awkward for me.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
