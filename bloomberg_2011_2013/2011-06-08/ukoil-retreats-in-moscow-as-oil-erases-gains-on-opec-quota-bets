OAO Lukoil,  Russia â€™s second-biggest
oil producer, fell for the first day this week as oil erased
gains amid speculation OPEC will increase production quotas.  The stock declined 1.4 percent to 1,766 rubles by 12:30
a.m. in Moscow.  Crude for July delivery dropped as much as 99 cents to
$98.10 a barrel in  New York  on bets the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries will increase its output target
when it meets in Vienna.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
