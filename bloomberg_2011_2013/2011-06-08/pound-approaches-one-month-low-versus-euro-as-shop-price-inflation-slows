The pound traded within half a penny
of its weakest level against the euro in a month as a report
showed U.K. shop-price inflation decelerated in May to its
slowest pace this year.  The U.K. currency slid versus the yen and the dollar as the
British Retail Consortium report showed prices charged by
retailers rose 2.3 percent from a year ago, after advancing 2.5
percent in April. The European Commission said yesterday the
U.K. government faces a “challenge” to implement its planned
budget-deficit reduction program and some of its growth
forecasts are too optimistic.  Sterling was little changed at 89.33 pence per euro as of
7:12 a.m. in  London , after reaching 89.46 pence yesterday, the
weakest level since May 5. It’s declined against the 17-nation
currency on each of the previous six days.  Against the dollar, the pound was 0.1 percent lower at
$1.6427. It declined 0.2 percent to 131.47 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
