Alliance Boots Holdings Ltd.’s sales
at the Boots pharmacy chain in the U.K. are running “above the
market,” according to Alex Gourlay, chief executive officer of
the health and beauty division.  “The market is not easy in the U.K.; we are more than
holding our own,” Gourlay said today in an interview at the
British Retail Consortium conference in  London . Boots is
Britain’s largest drugstore operator.  Alliance Boots, based in  Nottingham , England, is owned
jointly by Chairman Stefano Pessina and KKR & Co. after a buyout
in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
