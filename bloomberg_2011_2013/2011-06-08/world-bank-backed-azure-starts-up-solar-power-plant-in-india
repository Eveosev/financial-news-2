Azure Power , an Indian developer of
solar power plants backed by the  World Bank , has started running
a 5-megawatt project in western India.  The state government of Gujarat will buy power from the
plant under a 25-year power purchase agreement, the New Delhi-
based company said in an e-mailed statement. The International
Finance Corp., the private-sector financing arm of the World
Bank, is an investor in the project.  The 1.7 billion-rupee ($38 million) project at Khadoda
village in Gujarat’s Sabarkantha district will be expanded to 10
megawatts by the time it’s completed, Azure said.  Other investors include the U.S. Overseas Private
Investment Corp. and two venture-capital firms -- Helion
Advisors, based in Gurgaon near  New Delhi , and Menlo Park,
California-based Foundation Capital, Azure said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
