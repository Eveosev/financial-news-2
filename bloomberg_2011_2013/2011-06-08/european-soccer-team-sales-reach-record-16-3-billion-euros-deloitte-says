Record growth in  Europe ’s top five
leagues boosted revenue in the continent’s soccer industry by 4
percent to an all-time high of 16.3 billion euros ($23.8
billion) in 2009-10, accountant Deloitte LLP said.  England’s Premier League,  Germany ’s Bundesliga, Spain’s La
Liga, Italy’s Serie A and France’s Ligue 1 -- the “Big Five” -
- had total revenue of 8.4 billion euros, a 5 percent increase
over 2008-09, according to the most recent published accounts.  Elite soccer “has had a very good recession,” said Dan Jones, a partner with Deloitte’s Sports Business Group.  “It’s proven to be one of the last things people want to
give up,” Jones said in a telephone interview. “The passion
people feel for their football clubs, the entertainment, it
brings them release and escape from the everyday difficulties.”  An 8 percent increase in broadcast revenue to more than 4
billion euros was a catalyst for the growth. The Premier
League’s rose 7 percent to 1.04 billion pounds ($1.7 billion),
becoming the first 1 billion-pound broadcast revenue stream of
any domestic league, Deloitte said.  “Pay TV has proven to be one of the big winners in the
recession,” Jones said.  Overall, Premier League club revenue reached a record of
almost 2.5 billion euros, a 2 percent increase and more than 800
million euros ahead of the second-place  Bundesliga , Deloitte
said.  ‘Greatest Challenge’  Bundesliga revenue rose 6 percent to almost 1.7 billion
euros, 42 million more than La Liga, with 57 percent of the
Spanish growth driven by Real Madrid and Barcelona, whose
collective revenue increased by 69 million euros. Serie A’s
revenue also exceeded 1.5 billion euros, with Ligue 1 at 1.07
billion.  Cost control remains the sport’s “greatest business
challenge” as the five top leagues’ wages increased by over 400
million euros to more than 5.5 billion euros. Germany (138
million euros) and England (83 million euros) were the only of
the “Big Five” to achieve operating profits in 2009-10, while
the other three sustained losses.  Among other European countries, the Netherlands (420
million euros),  Turkey  (378 million euros) and  Russia  (368
million euros) have the largest revenue-generating leagues,
according to Deloitte.  To contact the reporter on this story:
