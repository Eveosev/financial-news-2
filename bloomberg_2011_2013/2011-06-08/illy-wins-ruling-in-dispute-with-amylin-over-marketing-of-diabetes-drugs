Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  won a ruling in a
lawsuit brought by  Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AMLN) , which wants to
prevent Lilly from using the same people to sell Amylin’s
diabetes drug and that of a competitor.  A federal judge in  San Diego  denied Amylin’s request for a
preliminary order that would have imposed restrictions on
Lilly’s diabetes sales force, the Indianapolis-based drugmaker
said in a statement today.  “We are pleased with the court’s decision,” Robert A. Armitage, Lilly’s general counsel, said in the statement. “We
believe that Amylin’s allegations against Lilly are entirely
without merit and we fully expect to prevail in this
litigation.”  Amylin, based in San Diego, sued Lilly last month, saying
the manner in which Lilly plans to implement an agreement to
develop and sell Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH’s type 2 diabetes
drug breached its agreement to develop and commercialize
Amylin’s competing drugs.  Amylin said in a statement today it will pursue the
litigation.  “Amylin continues to believe that Lilly’s conduct violates
our diabetes collaboration agreements, is anti-competitive and
limits patients’ treatment options,” the company said. “It is
important to note that the court’s decision did not make any
findings on the merits of our claims, but merely declines to
award injunctive relief, based on the conclusion that monetary
damages would be sufficient.”  The lawsuit is filed under seal and court documents weren’t
immediately available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
