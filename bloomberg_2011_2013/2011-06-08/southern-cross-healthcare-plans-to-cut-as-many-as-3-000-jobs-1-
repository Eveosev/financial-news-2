Southern Cross  Healthcare Group Plc,
the U.K.’s biggest nursing home operator, plans to cut as many
as 3,000 jobs as it seeks ways to reduce costs in addition to
proposals to slash rental payments.  The company, based in Darlington, northern  England , also
intends to bring in standard contracts and new work roles, it
said in a statement today. The redundancies, from a workforce of
44,000 people, will be completed by October. Home managers,
activity coordinators and administrators won’t be affected.  “The process of consultation and the proposed reduction in
staff numbers will not jeopardize the continuity or quality of
care provided to the company’s 31,000 residents,” Southern
Cross said in the statement.  The shares have plunged 87 percent in the past year, the
second-worst performance in the  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX) , as the
company struggles to avoid defaulting on 610 million pounds
($999 million) of bonds used to finance its properties.  Southern Cross, which was formerly owned by  Blackstone
Group LP (BX) , operates 750 old people’s homes. It said May 31 that
it will defer 30 percent of rental payments through September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
