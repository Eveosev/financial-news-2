German banks shed about a third of
the Greek debt they held in May 2010, perhaps reducing their
role in negotiations on a second bailout for  Greece , Financial
Times Deutschland reported.  German banks in January and February held more than 10.3
billion euros ($15 billion) in Greek bonds, compared with about
16 billion euros in April 2010, the newspaper said in an e-
mailed preview of an article to be published tomorrow, citing
the Bundesbank. The numbers appear to contradict figures from
the  Bank for International Settlements , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
