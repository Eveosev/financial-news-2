European stocks dropped for a sixth
day, as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  gave no hint
that the central bank will unveil a new round of stimulus. U.S.
futures were little changed and Asian shares retreated.  Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, Germany’s largest cable
operator, fell 3.7 percent after reporting a full-year loss.  The Stoxx 600  Europe  Index slid 0.3 percent to 271.18 at
8:03 a.m. in  London  for the longest losing streak since March.
Europe’s benchmark measure has fallen 6.9 percent since this
year’s high on Feb. 17 and is currently trading at about 13
times its companies’ reported earnings, near its cheapest
valuation since April 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring
in June gained less than 0.1 percent to 1,285.8. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index declined 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
