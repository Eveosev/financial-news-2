Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE)  Chief Executive
Officer Allen Chan said accusations made against the forestry
company by short-seller Carson Block are “false, unjustified
and unfair,” the Globe and Mail reported.  In an  interview  with the Globe, Chan said he was angry and
stunned by the claims of financial manipulation made by Block.
Sino-Forest, based in  Hong Kong  and Mississauga, Ontario,
refused to name clients who purchase its trees in China because
of competitive reasons, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
