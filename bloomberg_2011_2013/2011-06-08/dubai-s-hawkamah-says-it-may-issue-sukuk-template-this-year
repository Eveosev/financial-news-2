Hawkamah Institute for  Corporate
Governance  will issue a template for sukuk ijarah, to cut the
cost of issuing the debt and strengthen the Islamic finance
business, according to Nasser Saidi, the executive director.  The Dubai-based institute, which is working with the
Bahrain-based International Islamic Financial Market, or IIFM,
expects to release the document this year, Saidi told reporters
in Dubai today. Hawkamah plans more Islamic bond templates after
that, he said. Most sukuk are based on ijarah, a sale and lease
agreement, as in real estate.  The IIFM, an agency seeking to set standards for Islamic
securities, told Bloomberg in November that it plans to issue
global guidelines to facilitate the sale of sukuk in 12 to 18
months. It and Hawkamah have joined forces and are releasing the
sukuk ijarah template together, Saidi said.  He was speaking at a press conference on the release of a
report setting out 55 recommendations to strengthen corporate
governance in Islamic financial institutions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
