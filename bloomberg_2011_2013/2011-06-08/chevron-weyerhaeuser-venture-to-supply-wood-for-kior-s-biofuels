Catchlight Energy LLC, a joint
venture of  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY) , will supply
forest products that Kior Inc. will convert into biofuels.  The deal announced today expands an agreement made in April
for Catchlight to purchase gasoline and diesel fuel blendstocks
from Kior’s first commercial plant, in Columbus, Mississippi.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  Closely held Kior processes wood products to make biofuels
that can be converted at standard refineries into gasoline,
diesel or jet fuel. The $190 million Columbus facility is
expected to produce about 11 million gallons (42 million liters)
a year, and successive plants may be larger.  The Pasadena, Texas-based company is planning to build
other plants in Mississippi, Texas and Georgia that may cost
$350 million each.  Kior, which is backed by backed by renewable energy
investor Vinod Khosla, filed in April to raise as much as $100
million in an initial share sale on the Nasdaq Global Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
