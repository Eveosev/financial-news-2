Nigeria’s power generation capacity
fell 32 percent after  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Nigerian unit
halted its Utorogu natural-gas processing plant in the southern
Niger River Delta following a pipeline rupture.  The closure of the plant cut 1,800 megawatts of electricity
from the national grid and worsened the country’s power
shortage, the state-owned Power Holding Co. of Nigeria said
today in an e-mailed statement. Africa’s most populous country
of more than 140 million people currently generates only 3,800
megawatts of electricity.  “What we’re now investigating is where the leak took place
to determine the size,” Precious Okolobo, a Shell spokesman,
said today by phone from Lagos, the commercial capital. “We
don’t know when the plant will be back up again.”  The facility, which supplies gas to power stations in
 Nigeria , can process 300 million standard cubic feet of gas a
day. The leak was first detected on June 3, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
