Bill Gross , manager of the world’s
biggest mutual fund, said Mexican, German and Canadian debt is
more attractive than Treasuries.  The U.S. has been using “financial repression” to
stimulate the economy and bring real  interest rates  to a point
where they can’t go much lower, he said today at the Morningstar
conference in Chicago. Lawmakers in the U.S. will find it
difficult to start a third round of asset purchases through the
central bank, known as quantitative easing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
