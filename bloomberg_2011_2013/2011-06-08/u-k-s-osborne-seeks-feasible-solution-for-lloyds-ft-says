U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  has urged the Independent Commission on Banking
to make an “acceptable and feasible” proposal for  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , which was told by the ICB in its April
interim report that it may have to sell “substantially” more
than the 600 branches ordered by the European Union, the
Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the
situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
