A French wardship judge took the
view in March that  L’Oreal SA (OR)  heiress Liliane Bettencourt was
unfit to manage her own affairs, Agence France-Presse reported,
citing an unidentified person.  A procedure started by Bettencourt’s daughter Françoise
seeking to have her mother’s affairs put under management is
continuing, AFP said.  Investigating judge Jean-Michel Gentil yesterday visited
Bettencourt, 88, with police and doctors after she refused
legal summons on two occasions citing health reasons, AFP said.  Le Monde today reported that Francoise contacted wardship
judges on June 7 about her mother. The newspaper didn’t say how
it got the information.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
