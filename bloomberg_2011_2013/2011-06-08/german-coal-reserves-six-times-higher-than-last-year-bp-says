(Corrects million to billion in second paragraph.)  German proved coal reserves were six
times higher at the end of last year compared with 2009,  BP Plc (BP/) 
said, citing World Energy Council statistics.  German coal reserves were 40.7 billion tons, compared with
6.7 billion tons a year earlier, according to the BP Statistical
Review of World Energy.  Total global reserves rose 4.2 percent to 860.9 billion
tons, enough to meet consumption for 118 years. At the end of
2009, the reserves-to-production ratio was 119 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
