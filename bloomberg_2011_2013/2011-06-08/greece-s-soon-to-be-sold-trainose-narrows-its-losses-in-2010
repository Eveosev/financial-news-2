Trainose SA ,  Greece ’s state-
controlled passenger and freight train operator, narrowed losses
in 2010 as sales increased.  Trainose, which also operates the Athens suburban railway,
posted a net loss of 187.3 million euros ($273.9 million) last
year compared with a net loss of 231.1 million euros in 2009,
according to a financial statement from the Athens-based company
published in the  Imerisia  newspaper today.  Sales at the company increased to 102.7 million euros from
98.7 million euros. The Greek government plans to sell as much
as 100 percent of its holding in Trainose in the fourth quarter
this year as part of a program to raise 50 billion euros by the
end of 2015 in state asset sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
