Liverpool agreed on a fee with
Sunderland to buy its 20-year-old midfielder Jordan Henderson,
the Premier League soccer clubs announced on their websites.  Henderson will discuss contract terms and undergo a medical
examination in Liverpool today. He’s part of the England Under-
21 squad that heads to Denmark tomorrow for this summer’s
European Championship.  “A fee has been agreed with Liverpool for Jordan Henderson
and he travels to Anfield today with the club’s blessing,”
Sunderland said, without saying how much the 18-time English
champion offered. Reports in U.K. media suggest Liverpool’s
offer is 20 million pounds ($32.7 million) and may include its
French striker David N’Gog.  Once completed, the signing would be Liverpool’s third
major acquisition since it was bought by Boston Red Sox owner
Fenway Sports Group last October. In January, the team paid
about 55 million pounds for strikers Andy Carroll and  Luis Suarez  after selling  Fernando Torres  to Chelsea for 50 million
pounds, a record between U.K. clubs.  Henderson has played 79 times and scored five goals for
Sunderland since making his Black Cats debut in November 2008.
He made his first appearance for the senior England national
team against  France  in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
