U.S. free-trade agreements with
Colombia, Panama and  South Korea  will generate more than 10,000
U.S. jobs and add more than $770 million in pork sales annually
once the deals are fully implemented, according to the  National
Pork Producers Council .  The agreements, which are awaiting ratification by
Congress, will eliminate tariffs on pork products shipped to
those nations and add more than $11 to the price producers
receive per hog, Nick Giordano, a vice president for the NPPC,
said today in an interview at the World Pork Expo in  Iowa .  The forecasts are from an analysis conducted by Iowa State
University economist Dermot Hayes and based on a 10-year
implementation period of the deals, Giordano said. The estimates
are “conservative,” and the benefits are likely to occur
sooner than 10 years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
