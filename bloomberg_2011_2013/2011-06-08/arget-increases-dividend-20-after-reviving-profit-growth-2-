Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest U.S.
discount retailer, raised its quarterly dividend 20 percent
after reviving profit growth for two straight years.  The dividend will rise to 30 cents a share from 25 cents,
the Minneapolis-based company said today in a statement. The
payout is payable Sept. 10 to shareholders of record as of Aug.
18.  Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel has squeezed
profit out of the credit-card division, helping to make up for
slowing sales growth as consumer confidence wanes. Net income
climbed 17 percent last year, topping $2.9 billion.  Target fell 20 cents to $46.86 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 22 percent
this year, compared with little change for larger rival  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT)   To contact the reporter on this story:
