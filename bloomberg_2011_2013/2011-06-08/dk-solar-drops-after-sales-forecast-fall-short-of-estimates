LDK Solar Co., a Chinese maker of
solar panels, fell the most in a week after reporting first-
quarter revenue that was lower than analysts’ expectations and
it cut its sales forecast.  LDK dropped as much as 44 cents, or 6.2 percent, to $6.66
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The Xinyu, China-
based company declined 3.7 percent to $6.84 at 11:33 a.m.  Revenue in the first quarter was $766.3 million, according
to a statement released yesterday. Analysts had projected $784.9
million, the average of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Earnings of 95 cents a share beat analysts’ estimates of 82
cents.  LDK forecast revenue of $710 million to $760 million in the
current quarter, lower than the  $797.3 million analysts were
expecting before the report was released. Gross margin was 32
percent in the first quarter and will be between 22 percent to
26 percent this quarter, according to the statement.  The company’s falling stock price is the result of
“deterioration in pricing” in the solar industry due to
falling margins and overcapacity, Wayne Chang, an analyst at
Brean Murray Carret & Co., said in a research report today.  Chang cut his target price today to $12 for LDK from $20
and maintained his “buy” recommendation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
