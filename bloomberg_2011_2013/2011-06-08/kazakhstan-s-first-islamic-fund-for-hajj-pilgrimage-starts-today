(Corrects name of fund to Hajj Fund in third paragraph of
story published yesterday.)  The first Islamic fund in  Kazakhstan 
started today to lure capital from Muslims who plan to travel to
Mecca,  Saudi Arabia , for the Islamic pilgrimage.  The Hajj Fund, co-managed by AmanahRaya Capital Group Sdn
Bhd, part of Amanah Raya Berhad, and Astana-based Fattan
Finance, will be invested in portfolios that consist of
properties, equities and other Shariah-compliant instruments
mostly outside of Kazakhstan, said Ahmad Rodzi Pawanteh, group
managing director of Kuala Lumpur-based Amanah Raya. Almost half
of the country’s 15.5 million people are Muslim, according to
the Central Intelligence Agency’s  World Factbook .  “This Hajj Fund is actually a fund to enable the Muslim
community in Kazakhstan to have a saving program to enable them
to perform Hajj, the fifth pillar of Islam,” he said in a
telephone interview from Astana today. The fund will return
between 6 percent and 8 percent on average annually over a
three-year period, he said.  The fund may attract 1 million investors over the next
three years, and will likely enable about 200 people to travel
to Mecca for Hajj in the next two years, the fund managers said
in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
