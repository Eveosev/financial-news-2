The first tropical storm of the
season in the eastern Pacific, Adrian, strengthened to just
below hurricane level, prompting storm watches along the Mexican
coast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  The system, with maximum winds of about 70 miles per hour
(113 kilometers per hour), is moving north-northwest at near 7
mph and is expected to remain safely at sea, the Miami-based
agency said in a website  advisory  at 11 a.m. West Coast time.
Adrian is about 265 miles south-southwest of Acapulco.  “Additional strengthening is likely during the next couple
of days and Adrian could become a hurricane later today,” the
center said. “On the forecast track, Adrian is expected to
remain offshore of the coast of  Mexico . However, any deviation
to the right of the forecast track could bring tropical storm
conditions to the coast.”  A tropical storm watch extends from Acapulco westward to
Punta San Telmo, meaning winds of at least 39 mph are possible
within 48 hours, according to the hurricane center. Adrian will
reach hurricane status when winds hit 74 mph.  The hurricane center has stopped tracking a low pressure
system in the northwestern  Caribbean Sea .  To contact the reporters on this story:
