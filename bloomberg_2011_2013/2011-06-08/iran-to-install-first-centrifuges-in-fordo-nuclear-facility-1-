Iran  will “soon” install an initial
series of centrifuges at the Fordo nuclear facility, the
country’s second site for enriching uranium, Vice President
Fereydoun Abbasi said.  Abbasi, who was speaking to the official  Islamic Republic
News Agency  today, did not provide a timeline.  The existence of the Fordo plant, built into the side of a
mountain near the city of Qom south of Tehran, was disclosed in
September 2009. The revelation heightened concerns among the
U.S. and its allies over  Iran’s nuclear program , which they say
is a cover for the development of atomic weapons, a charge the
Persian Gulf country rejects.  Centrifuges are fast-spinning machines that enrich nuclear
fuel by separating uranium isotopes. Uranium can be used to fuel
reactors or, enriched to higher degrees, form the core of a
bomb.  Iranian officials have said that the Fordo plant has a
maximum enrichment capacity of 5 percent and isn’t an
“industrial-scale unit.” In October 2009 they said the plant
was about 18 months away from beginning operations.  Iran is already enriching uranium to 20 percent at its
Natanz nuclear facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
