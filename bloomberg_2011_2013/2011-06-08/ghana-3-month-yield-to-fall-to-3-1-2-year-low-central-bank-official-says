Ghana ’s three-month borrowing costs
are poised to drop to a 3 1/2-year low by the end of June as
inflation may slow to the weakest since at least December,
according to the West African nation’s central bank.  The yield on 91-day debt, used by banks as a benchmark to
determine their lending rates, will decline to about 10 percent
from 10.6 percent at the June 3 sale, Adams Nyinaku, the head of
treasury at the Bank of Ghana, said in a telephone interview
from the capital, Accra. That would be the lowest since October
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The next weekly
auction takes place on June 10.  “Inflation has been coming down and we expect it to
continue into June,” he said. “Looking at inflation, the 91-
day treasury bill yield will go down.”  Yields on Ghana’s debt have fallen to about 11 percent from
as high as 26 percent in 2009 as inflation decelerated for 18
consecutive months to 8.6 percent in December. Price growth
quickened in January and February on a 30 percent increase in
gasoline costs on Jan. 4, before slowing to 9 percent in April,
the second month of declines. The central bank has an inflation
target band of 8.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.  “Indications are that trends may probably ease into the
upper limit of 8 percent by the end of the second quarter,” the
 Bank of Ghana  said of inflation in a May 31  report  on its
website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
