Ivory Coast aims to boost cotton
production to at least 200,000 metric tons in the current season
by increasing the price paid to growers of the fiber by 26
percent.  Farmers will receive 265  CFA francs  ($0.59) a kilogram (2.2
pounds) for premium-quality cotton in the 2011-12 harvesting
season, Laurent Fihox, spokesman for  Intercoton , the national
association of cotton growers and ginners, said by telephone
today. That compares with 210 francs paid in the season that
ended last month, he said.  “By setting a good farmgate price for 2011-12, we are
hoping to attract new producers,” Fihox said.  Ivory Coast produced 174,000 tons of cotton in the 2010-11
season, 15 percent below initial forecasts, according to Fihox.  “Production was not as good as we had hoped because of
unfavorable weather,” he said. “There was too much rainfall in
October and November.”  Harvesting of cotton, grown exclusively in the country’s
arid north, typically peaks around November.  Ivory Coast  is the
eighth-largest cotton producer on the African continent,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign
Agriculture Service. The country is the world’s biggest grower
of cocoa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
