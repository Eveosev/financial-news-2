European insurers have sufficient
financial strength, the chairman of the region’s supervisory
authority for the industry said before the publication of
 stress-test  results scheduled for next month.  The European Commission and the European Insurance and
Occupational Pensions Authority, or Eiopa, along with local
regulators, are developing a risk-based regulatory framework for
the region’s insurers such as  Allianz SE (ALV)  and  Axa SA. (CS)  The new
rules, named Solvency II, are scheduled for introduction in
2013. Insurers have been examined in a stress test this year
based on the regulatory changes.  “The situation and solidity of insurers right now is very
comfortable,” Gabriel Bernardino, Eiopa’s chairman, told
journalists in Frankfurt yesterday. “That doesn’t mean some
insurers won’t need to raise capital under the new regime where
risk is at the center.”  The stress-test results from 221 insurers in 31 countries
are being gathered by local regulators and Eiopa plans to
publish aggregated results in July, according to Bernardino. The
test include market risks as well as insurance-specific risks
such as hits from major catastrophes, he said.  The current timetable for the introduction of Solvency II
at the beginning of 2013 is “challenging” as some legislation
still needs to be put in place, Bernardino said, adding that
“there will certainly be transition periods in areas such as
hybrid debt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
