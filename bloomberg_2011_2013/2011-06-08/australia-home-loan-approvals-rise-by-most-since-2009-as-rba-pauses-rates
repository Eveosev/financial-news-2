Australian home-loan approvals rose
in April by the most since March 2009, the first increase in
financings this year, as the central bank extended a pause in
raising  interest rates .  The number of loans granted to build or buy houses and
apartments gained 4.8 percent from March, when they fell a
revised 1.1 percent, the statistics bureau said in Sydney today.
That compares with the median estimate for approvals to rise 2.8
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens held the
benchmark rate at 4.75 percent yesterday after boosting
borrowing costs seven times from October 2009 to November to
prevent a  property-market  bubble from forming in a nation where
more than two-thirds of households own their homes. Prices
declined in the first quarter by the most since 2008 as floods
in the nation’s northeast disrupted the property market.  “The result is a function of the rate reprieve since
November,” said  Michael Turner , an economist at RBC Capital
Markets Ltd. in Sydney who forecast a 5 percent gain. “The
details aren’t fantastic, but it’s still encouraging to see the
series stabilizing after three monthly falls.”  Local Currency  The Australian dollar was little changed after the report,
trading at $1.0660 at 12:10 p.m. in Sydney from $1.0675 just
before the release.  The total value of loans rose 3.8 percent to A$19.8 billion
($21.1 billion) in April, today’s report showed.  The value of lending to owner-occupiers gained 6.3 percent,
the report showed. The value of loans to investors who plan to
rent or resell homes dropped 1.6 percent.  First-home buyers accounted for 15.8 percent of dwellings
that were financed in April, down from 16 percent in March and
lower than 16.9 percent a year earlier, the report showed today.  An index measuring the weighted average of prices for
established houses in eight major cities slid 1.7 percent in the
first quarter from three months earlier, the biggest fall since
the third quarter of 2008, a government report showed May 2.
There was a decrease in transactions in Queensland’s capital,
Brisbane, it said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
