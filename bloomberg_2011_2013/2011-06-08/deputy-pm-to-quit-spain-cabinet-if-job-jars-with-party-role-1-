Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said he’ll quit his job in the Spanish government if
it conflicts with his role as the ruling Socialist party’s
candidate in general elections next year.  Rubalcaba has received the backing of senior Socialist
officials to lead the party into the election, even as the party
plans to hold a primary election on June 26 to formally choose
its candidate. Rubalcaba is also interior minister and spokesman
for the government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who said in April he wouldn’t seek a third term.  “I’ll leave the government when I think my
responsibilities are incompatible with those of the party,”
Rubalcaba told Parliament today in  Madrid .  Zapatero is trying to overhaul legislation to shield the
economy from the sovereign-debt crisis even as his party
prepares for a general election next March. After implementing
public-wage cuts and a freeze on pensions, the ruling party
suffered its worst local-election defeat in three decades on May
22 and polls show it will also lose the general election to the
 People’s Party  led by Mariano Rajoy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
