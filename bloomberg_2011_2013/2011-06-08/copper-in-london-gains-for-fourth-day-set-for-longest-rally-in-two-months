Copper in  London  climbed for a fourth
day, set for its longest rally since April, as ongoing supply
disruptions and a weaker dollar offset concern about an economic
slowdown.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 0.2 percent to $9,157.50 a metric ton
at 8:05 a.m. Singapore time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
