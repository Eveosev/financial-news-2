Thomas Emma, a former  Duke University 
basketball captain, was found dead after eyewitnesses said he
jumped from the  New York  Athletic Club building, according to
police.  Witnesses told officers that Emma, 49, jumped from the
building at 180 Central Park South yesterday morning, Joe Cavitolo, a New York Police Department public information
officer, said in a telephone interview. Emma’s body was found at
11:28 a.m. on the second-floor landing of the building next
door.  No suicide note was found and foul play isn’t suspected,
with an investigation continuing, Cavitolo said. It’s unknown
whether alcohol was involved and cause of death will be
determined by the medical examiner, the police spokesman said.  Emma played for Duke from 1979 through 1983. A captain for
the 1982-83 season, his .843 career free throw percentage ranks
fourth in school history. He was picked in the 10th round of the
1983 National Basketball Association draft by the  Chicago Bulls .  Emma, a Manhasset, New York, native who lived on the Upper
East Side of Manhattan, was the president of Power Performance
Inc., a company that specializes in training young athletes, the
Daily News reported. He also wrote books about athletic
performance, including “101 Strength and Conditioning Exercises
and Drills for Basketball.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
