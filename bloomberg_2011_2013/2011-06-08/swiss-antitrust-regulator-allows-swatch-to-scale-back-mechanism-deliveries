Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the biggest maker of
Swiss watch motors, will be allowed to start reducing deliveries
to competing timepiece manufacturers next year as it seeks to
end a regulatory requirement that it sell components to rivals.  Swatch, the Biel, Switzerland-based maker of the Omega and
Breguet brands, will be permitted to scale back sales of
mechanical movements to third parties to 85 percent of the level
sold in 2010, the country’s competition regulator, Comco, said
today in a  statement .  The world’s biggest watchmaker has been required to supply
movements to third parties because of its dominant position.
Swatch’s ETA unit manufactures as many as 80 percent of the
mechanisms made in  Switzerland , according to a Sanford C.
Bernstein estimate. Swatch has sought permission from Comco
since 2009 to choose who it sells movements to.  The company has shown that it’s willing to accept a
“gradual” solution, Comco said.  Swatch rose as much as 40 centimes, or 0.1 percent, to
403.60 Swiss francs and was trading at 403.50 francs as of 9:48
a.m. in Zurich.  Next year’s permitted reduction in motor deliveries forms a
provisional measure while the regulator conducts an
investigation into the matter, Comco said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
