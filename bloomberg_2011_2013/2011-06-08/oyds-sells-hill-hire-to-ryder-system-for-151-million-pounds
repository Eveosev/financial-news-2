Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender, sold Hill Hire Plc to  Ryder System Inc. (R) 
for 151 million pounds ($247 million).  Miami-based Ryder, the largest U.S. truck-leasing company
paid cash for the British truck rental firm and the sale
completed today, Lloyds said in a statement. Hill Hire’s book
value is 167 million pounds, the bank said.  “This transaction is part of the group’s ongoing strategy
to divest assets which are not core to its business,” London-
based Lloyds said in the statement.  Lloyds Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio is
reviewing the bank’s operations after he replaced  Eric Daniels 
in March. Bank of Scotland Plc bought Hill Hire in 1999 for 74
million pounds to add to its vehicle-financing business and it
was acquired by Lloyds through its 2008 takeover of HBOS Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
