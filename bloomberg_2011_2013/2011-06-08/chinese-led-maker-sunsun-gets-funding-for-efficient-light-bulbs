SunSun Lighting Holdings Asia Ltd., a
Chinese manufacturer of light-emitting diodes, received $10
million from the Beijing-based venture capital investor GSR
Ventures to commercialize its energy-efficient products.  The company introduced a 9-watt LED bulb in February
designed to replace standard, 60-watt incandescent bulbs, and is
building a manufacturing plant that will be able to produce 30
million LED bulbs a year, SunSun said today in a statement. Its
manufacturing facility in Changzhou produces more than 10
million bulbs a year.  “There is huge market potential for solid-state
lighting,” Sonny Wu, GSR’s founder and a managing director,
said in the statement. “If traditional lighting could be
replaced by LED technology, it would be a $300 billion market 
globally in a few years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
