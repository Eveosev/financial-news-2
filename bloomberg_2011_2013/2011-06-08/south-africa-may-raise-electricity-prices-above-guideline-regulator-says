South Africa ’s energy regulator will
hold public hearings tomorrow on proposals by cities and towns
including Johannesburg and Pretoria to increase electricity
tariffs beyond the watchdog’s 20.38 percent guideline.  Nineteen municipalities propose gains above the guideline
for 2011-12, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa said
on its  website  today. Maluti-A-Phofung proposed the highest
increase of 29 percent, according to the statement.  Officials at the regulator weren’t immediately available to
comment on the guideline when Bloomberg News called its Pretoria
office today, and didn’t respond to e-mailed questions.  State-run Eskom Holdings Ltd., supplier of most electricity
redistributed by municipalities to customers, is raising prices
to fund expansion and prevent a repeat of 2008 power cuts. The
regulator allowed Eskom to raise tariffs 26 percent this year.  Johannesburg’s City Power sought a 22 percent jump in 2011-
12 prices, citing “Eskom’s structural changes” and “high
primary energy costs” at a power plant.  Pretoria ’s Kungwini and
Nokeng tsa Taemane areas also asked for 22 percent, citing the
cost of “merger management.” Others seeking increases in
excess of the regulator’s guideline include Umhlathuze.  To contact the reporter on this story:
