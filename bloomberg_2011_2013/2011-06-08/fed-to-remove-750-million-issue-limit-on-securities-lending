The  Federal Reserve  will remove the
$750 million issue-specific limit on securities that dealers
borrow from its open market account.  The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  will eliminate the cap
tomorrow, the bank said in a statement today on its  website .
Other terms will remain unchanged, the statement said. In
December, the Fed cut the minimum fee it charges dealers to
borrow securities.  The Fed offers specific  Treasury securities  held by its
System Open Market Account, or SOMA, for loan to dealers against
Treasury general collateral on an overnight basis. Dealers bid
in a multiple-price auction held every day at noon New York
time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
