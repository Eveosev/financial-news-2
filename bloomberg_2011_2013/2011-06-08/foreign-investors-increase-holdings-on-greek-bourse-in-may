Foreign investors increased their
holdings of stocks listed on the Greek stock exchange in May,
according to data released by Hellenic Exchanges SA, the
operator of the Athens bourse.  Non-resident investors held 51.2 percent of the market
value of all stocks listed on the Athens Stock Exchange in May,
compared with 49.55 percent in May 2010. In April, foreign
investors owned 50.8 percent, according to figures released on
May 6.  Greece ’s benchmark ASE share index has lost 8.4 percent so
far this year, as the Greek government pushes to pass 78 billion
euros in additional fiscal measures and assets sales through
2015 and convince investors that it won’t have to restructure
its debt. Foreign investors accounted for 50.5 percent of total
turnover in May, according to today’s statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
