The zloty pared its decline against
the euro after the Polish central bank raised the main interest
rate for the fourth time this year.  The zloty traded 0.3 percent weaker at 3.9529 per euro as
of 1:52 p.m. in Warsaw. Earlier, it depreciated as much as 0.6
percent against the euro. The Narodowy Bank Polski raised the
benchmark seven-day interest rate by a quarter point to 4.5
percent, matching the expectations of 26 of 33 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
