Global proved oil reserves rose by
0.5 percent in 2010, boosted by increases in  India , Brazil and
Russia, according to  BP Plc. (BP/)   Deposits advanced to 1.3832 trillion barrels at the end of
last year from a revised 1.3766 trillion in 2009, BP said today
in its annual Statistical Review of World Energy. India’s
available oil climbed 55 percent to 9 billion barrels.  Saudi Arabia’s reserves remain the largest at 264.5 billion
barrels, BP said, little changed on last year. The  Middle East 
has 54.4 percent of the total, down from 56.6 percent last year.  Russia, the world’s biggest crude producer, boosted its
reserves to 77.4 billion barrels from a revised 76.7 billion a
year earlier, according to BP. Russia’s share of the total is
5.6 percent. Brazil’s deposits rose 10 percent to 14.2 billion
barrels, BP said.  Reserves in Norway and  Mexico  fell last year, according to
BP. Output in both countries is in decline. Norwegian oil output
will fall 6 percent this year, its 11th annual drop, according
to the Stavanger-based Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.  BP said the estimates in today’s report are a combination
of official sources, OPEC data and other third-party estimates.
Deposits include gas condensates and natural-gas liquids, as
well as crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
