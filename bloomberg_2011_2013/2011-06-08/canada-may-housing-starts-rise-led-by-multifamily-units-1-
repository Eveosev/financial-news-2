Canadian housing starts rose in May
for the third time in four months, led by multiple-unit
dwellings, according to government figures.  Work began on 183,600 units at an annual rate on a
seasonally adjusted basis, up 2.7 percent from a revised April
figure of 178,700, Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said today in
Ottawa. Economists forecast a reading of 182,000, according to
the median of 21 responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  The number of urban homes such as condominiums and
apartments rose 4 percent to 100,000 in May. Single-family
projects in cities fell 4.1 percent to 61,000 units, the lowest
since August 2009. Rural projects were estimated at a 22,600
unit pace.  Housing starts will decline 5.5 percent this year in part
because of tighter mortgage regulations, Canada Mortgage &
Housing Corp. said in a May 30  forecast . Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  in March shortened the maximum amortization period for
government-insured mortgages to 30 years from 35 years and
lowered the maximum amount homeowners can borrow against the
value of their homes, citing concern that Canadians were taking
on record debt burdens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
