Lithuania’s banking industry is
stable and showing signs of recovery, central bank Governor
Vitas Vasiliauskas said, citing stress tests of the Baltic
nation’s lenders.  The country’s financial industry, where Scandinavian banks
including SEB AB and Swedbank AB account for 80 percent, is
likely to be profitable this year, with credit growing between 4
percent and 5 percent, Vasiliauskas said in a press conference
in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius today.  Banks “remain stable,” he said, adding that they may need
as much as 650 million litai ($276 million) in additional
capital to cope with a possible “drastic” increase in  interest
rates , according to one scenario in the stress tests.  Falling exports, a jump in interest rates and overheating
real-estate industry in  Sweden  are potential risks to
Lithuanian banks, he said.  Proposed guidelines for responsible lending, including
limits on credits for real estate developers and mortgage loans
are expected to come into force in the second half this year to
prevent bubbles in the industry, the governor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
