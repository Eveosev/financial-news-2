Turkish bond yields fell the first
day in four as industrial production slowed for a third month,
easing concern the country’s economic expansion will continue to
send the current-account deficit surging.  Yields on benchmark two-year bonds slumped four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.91 percent, at the 5 p.m.
close in Istanbul, according to the TEB local benchmark bond
index. The lira was little changed at 1.5810 per dollar.  Industrial output declined 0.6 percent in April from a
month earlier, according to data published by the government
statistics agency. Turkish policy makers have increased bank
reserve requirements four times since December in an effort to
curb  consumer lending  that has helped widen the current-account
deficit to record levels.  “April industrial production data will strengthen the
central bank’s hand further and improve its credibility,” Ozgur Altug, chief economist at BGC Partners, said in a note to
clients today.  The  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  of stocks declined 0.6 percent
to 64,067.11, falling for the first day in three.  To contact the reporter on this story:
