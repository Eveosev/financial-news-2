Poland  may start freeing gas prices
next year, Marek Woszczyk, head of the country’s energy
regulator, told reporters today.  The watchdog is deciding whether to approve a price
increase proposal for  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo
SA (PGN) , the dominant gas distributor known as PGNiG, which asked to
raise prices July 1. Regulators are waiting for the company to
reply to queries, Woszczyk said.  “There is no competition on the market, which is
practically dominated by PGNiG, so we cannot exempt the company
from price regulation,” said Woszczyk. “We are currently
working on a schedule for liberalizing the gas market and I
cannot rule out that the process will start in 2012.”  PGNiG imports about two-thirds of its gas from  Russia ,
buying the fuel at a price set in dollars based on a nine-month
average of oil-related products, and selling it at a rate set in
zloty by the regulator.  To contact the reporters on this story:
