Russia is considering increasing
duties on fuels and lubricants while moving away from a
transport tax, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said.  The idea of canceling the transport tax was previously
rejected by regional governments in search of budget revenue,
Putin said at a meeting with the country’s transport union
today.  “But it doesn’t mean it will always be like this,” Putin
said. “We are indeed thinking of raising excises while removing
the transport tax.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
