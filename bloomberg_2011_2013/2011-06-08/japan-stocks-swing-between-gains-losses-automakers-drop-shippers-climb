Japanese stocks gained for a second
day after sentiment among merchants jumped the most in more than
two years, suggesting consumers may be recovering from the
country’s worst disaster since World War II.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest
publicly traded lender, gained 0.8 percent after JPMorgan Chase
& Co. raised its rating on the banking sector.  Sumitomo Rubber
Industries Ltd. (5110) , Japan’s second-largest tiremaker, led rubber-
products makers higher after Citigroup Inc. said tire demand is
still strong.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co., owner of the nuclear
power plant crippled by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami,
dropped 7.4 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said the
government may idle of all of the country’s atomic plants.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.1 percent to 9,449.46
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, erasing an earlier loss that came
as the yen rose to its highest in a month against the dollar,
cutting the earnings outlook for exporters. The broader Topix
index rose 0.1 percent to 814.45 after a gauge of confidence
among Japanese merchants rose the most since March 2009.  “People think the job markets and wages are going to get
better,” said Ikuo Mitsui, who helps manage $25 million at
Vivace Capital Management Co. “For the market, there’s a
feeling that the economy and corporate performance are going to
recovery more quickly.”  Fukushima Disaster  The Topix has tumbled 13 percent since March 10, a day
before the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that devastated
 Japan ’s northeast coast, damaging  Tokyo Electric ’s Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant and leaving almost 24,000 people dead or missing.  The Economy Watchers current conditions index, a survey of
barbers, taxi drivers and others who deal with consumers, rose
to 36 from 28.3 in April and 27.7 in March, the Cabinet Office
said today in Tokyo. A reading above 50 indicates people think
conditions are improving.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and its closest rival
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  both climbed 0.8 percent
after JPMorgan raised the banking sector to “bullish” from
“neutral.”  Makers of tires and other rubber products had the biggest
gain among the Topix’s 33 industry groups after Citigroup
maintained its “buy” rating on the sector, saying retail
demand for tires is “strong.”  Sumitomo Rubber gained 2.4 percent to 985 yen after
Citigroup boosted the stock price estimate to 1,240 yen from
1,050 yen, while  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , the world’s biggest
tiremaker, rose 1.6 percent to 1,837 yen. Its target price was
raised to 2,480 yen from 2,260 yen.  ‘Frustratingly Slow’  Stocks plunged earlier after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  described the U.S. recovery as “uneven” and
“frustratingly slow,” while offering no hint of a new round of
economic stimulus. The Fed’s policy of buying treasuries to prop
up demand, known as quantitative easing is due to finish this
month.  “Economic data has been soft so markets seemed to be
hoping Bernanke would offer a bit more,” said  Shane Oliver ,
head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
manages about $98 billion in Sydney.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell for a fifth day
yesterday in  New York , the longest slump for the S&P in almost a
year, sliding 0.1 percent to its lowest level since March 18.
Recent data showing weakness in the economy, including an
increase in the  unemployment rate  to 9.1 percent in May, has
raised the odds the Fed will hold the benchmark interest rate
near zero into next year.  Shippers Rise  Japanese shipping companies gained after Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co. said that the market for cargo
transport will “bottom out.’  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) 
climbing 1.2 percent to 264 yen. Mitsubishi UFJ raised its
investment rating to “outperform” from “neutral.”  Bigger rival Nippon Yusen K.K. rose 1.4 percent to 294 yen
after its price estimate was boosted to 390 yen from 370 yen.  Tokyo Electric tumbled 7.4 percent to 200 yen, the biggest
drop on the Nikkei 225, after the Nikkei newspaper reported the
government may for utilities to idle all 54 of Japan’s nuclear
reactors by next spring if those shut down for scheduled
maintenance don’t receive the required local approval to restart.  To contact the reporters on this story:
