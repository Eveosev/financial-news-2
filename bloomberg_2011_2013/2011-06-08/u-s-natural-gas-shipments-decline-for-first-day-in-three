Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators slipped for the first time in three
days as shipments to the Southeast declined.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments dropped 2.9 percent to 20
million dekatherms (19.5 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in the
Southeast fell 10 percent to 4.68 million dekatherms.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 2.7 percent to
24.2 million dekatherms.  Wholesale gas at the Sonat-T1 hub, where gas is delivered
from Texas and Louisiana to the Southeast, fell 0.2 cent to
$4.8477 per million British thermal units yesterday on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
slipped 0.3 cent to $4.8262 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
