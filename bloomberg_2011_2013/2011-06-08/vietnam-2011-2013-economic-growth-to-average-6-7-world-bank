Vietnam ’s gross domestic product
growth will average 6.7 percent in the period 2011 to 2013, the
 World Bank  forecast today in its Global Economic Prospects
report.  “Despite the encouraging growth outlook, policymakers will
face stiff challenges in the near term, as they will need to
ensure that the recovery remains on track as expansionary fiscal
measures are withdrawn amidst building inflationary pressure,”
the bank said in the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
