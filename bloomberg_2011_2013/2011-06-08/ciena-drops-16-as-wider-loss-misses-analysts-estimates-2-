Ciena Corp. (CIEN) , the maker of network
gear for the biggest U.S. phone companies, fell the most in
2 1/2 years after reporting second-quarter results that missed
analysts’ estimates, hurt by acquisition costs.  Ciena fell $3.92, or 16 percent, to $20.29 at 4 p.m. New
York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the biggest decline since
December 2008. The shares have lost 3.6 percent this year.  The loss, excluding charges such as an adjustment to the
value of its inventory, widened to $22.4 million, or 24 cents a
share, the Linthicum, Maryland-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. Analysts projected 11 cents, the average of
19 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The results included integration costs and consulting fees
stemming from its purchase of an Ethernet business from bankrupt
Nortel Networks Corp. last year. Ciena makes fiber-optic network
gear that phone carriers use to transmit video and other
bandwidth-intensive traffic.  Ciena forecast third-quarter sales to rise to $435 million
to $455 million, according to the filing. Analysts projected
$454.2 million, the average of 18 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
