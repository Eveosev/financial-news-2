Sugar rose to an eight-week high as
production may fall short of expectations in  Brazil , the world’s
top grower. Cocoa and coffee also gained.  Sugar output in Center South, Brazil’s main producing
region, will total an estimated 33 million metric tons this year
amid lower crop yields, according to Raizen, a cane venture
between Cosan SA Industria & Comercio and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.
Unica, an industry group, forecast output at 34.6 million tons
in March.  “Brazilian output is causing the whole market to rally,”
said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures in Tampa,
Florida. “That is the big news right now.”  Raw sugar for July delivery advanced 0.6 cent, or 2.5
percent, to settle at 24.95 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . Earlier, the price touched 25.18
cents, the highest since April 13.  Cocoa futures for September delivery climbed $20, or 0.7
percent, to $2,921 a ton on ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery gained 0.85 cent,
or 0.3 percent, to $2.6385 a pound in New York.  In  London , refined sugar, cocoa and robusta coffee rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
