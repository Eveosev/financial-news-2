Sweden plans to expand its military
support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s mission to
bring stability to  Libya , the minority government said after
securing backing from two of three opposition parties.  The air-force surveillance efforts will expand to include
all parts of the military and humanitarian campaign in Libya,
from previously only helping uphold the United Nation’s approved
no-fly zone, Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said today at a press
conference in  Stockholm . A marine boarding force will be
supplied to enforce the UN weapons embargo against the North
African country, he said.  “The military pressure should be kept up to speed up the
political process,” Bildt said. “We will now focus the air
force mission on surveillance for the entirety of the
operations, for all parts of the military operations and all
part of the humanitarian operations.”  Sweden’s parliament in April agreed to send eight  Saab AB (SAABB) 
Gripen fighter planes to Libya for three months as part of a
NATO-led effort to enforce a no-fly zone. Five of these planes
will remain in Libya, Bildt said.  The government plans to present a bill to parliament
tomorrow which it expects will be approved the end of next week
to extend the Swedish mission beyond June 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
