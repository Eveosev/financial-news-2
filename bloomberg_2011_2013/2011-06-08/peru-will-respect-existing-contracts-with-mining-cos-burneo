Peru  will respect existing contracts
with mining companies, said an adviser to the Andean country’s
President-elect Ollanta Humala. Mining stocks rose on the news.  “We will respect accords with companies that have tax
stability contracts,” Kurt Burneo, Humala’s chief economic
adviser, said today in an interview in Lima. “There’s an
extraordinary situation with high prices, and the state has the
legitimate right to charge taxes, not expect a handout.”  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , Peru’s biggest copper producer,
gained 2.1 percent to $31.95 in Lima trading. Volcan Cia. Minera
SAA, Peru’s largest zinc and silver miner, added 5.6 percent to
3.04 soles.  Peruvian mining stocks plunged on June 6 on concern that
Humala will raise mining royalties and increase government
control over natural resources.  Lima ’s Exchange suspended
trading after the Lima General Index fell the most since 1981.  Humala’s government will ask mining companies to pay more
taxes on surging copper and gold prices, Burneo said. Humala, a
former military rebel, won the June 5 election against
Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for July delivery
fell 4.1 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $4.1085 a pound at
1:16 p.m., the biggest decline since June 1. The price has
climbed 48 percent in the past 12 months.  Gold futures for August delivery fell $5.30, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,538.70 an ounce at 1:48 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The metal has gained 24 percent in the past
Year on the Comex in New York, reaching a record $1,577.40 on
