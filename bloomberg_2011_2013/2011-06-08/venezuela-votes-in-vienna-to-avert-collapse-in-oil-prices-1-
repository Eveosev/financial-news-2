Venezuela  was concerned  oil prices 
would “collapse” if OPEC had increased production limits at
today’s meeting in Vienna, the country’s oil minister said in an
interview with state television.  “There was a proposal to raise output by between 1.5
million barrels a day and 2 million,” said the minister, Rafael Ramirez. “We, given the uncertainty in the market, thought that
could cause the price of oil to collapse.”  Venezuela, which has the world’s second-largest oil
reserves after Saudi Arabia, is one of six members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to oppose a
proposal to increase output quotas. Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest
producer, was in favor of increasing production, its oil
minister, Ali al-Naimi, said.  “International agencies are looking for fissures in
OPEC,” Ramirez said. “It’s not about that, the conditions to
make that decision aren’t there. OPEC remains united and has
emerged strengthened from the meeting.”  Other OPEC producers that opposed an increase in production
were Libya, Angola, Ecuador, Algeria and Iran, al-Naimi said.
 Saudi Arabia  has a 19.1 percent share of global oil reserves,
while Venezuela has 15.3 percent, according to BP Plc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
