Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki ordered
a halt to further cuts in mobile-phone call tariffs after
companies including  Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM)  and Telkom  Kenya  Ltd. opposed
the reductions, Business Daily reported.  A directive issued on May 18 ordered that interconnection
fees, the rates operators charge each other to connect voice
calls across networks, remain at current levels, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said, citing a May 18 communication by the
president. The Communications Commission of Kenya ratified the
decision, it said.  Charges had been expected to drop to 1.44 shilling (2
cents) at the beginning of July from 2.21 shillings, it said.  Two phone calls to the Kenyan presidency by Bloomberg this
morning didnâ€™t connect.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
