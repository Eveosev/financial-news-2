The  Federal Reserve  drained $280
million in reserves from the banking system when it arranged
overnight tri-party reverse repurchase agreements.  The transactions, part of a series of open-market
operations that began in 2009, don’t represent any change in
monetary policy, according to a statement yesterday on the
 Federal Reserve  Bank of New York’s  website .  Treasuries, agencies
and agency mortgage-backed securities were eligible collateral.
Settlement is one day forward.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties. The central bank added more than $1
trillion in extra cash to its balance sheet as part of its
effort to combat the financial crisis.  Today’s reverse repos were the first in the series of
“readiness exercises” to utilize the  money market funds 
managed by 17 firms that were added as counterparties on May 23.
The Fed began adding money funds last year as the 20 securities
firms that act as primary dealers work to shore up their own
balance sheets after the worst financial crisis in decades.  In a tri-party arrangement, a third party functions as the
agent for the transaction and holds the security as collateral.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. are the
only banks that serve in a trade-clearing capacity in the tri-
party repo market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
