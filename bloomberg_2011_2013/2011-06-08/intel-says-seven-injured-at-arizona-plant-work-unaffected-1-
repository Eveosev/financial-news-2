Intel Corp. (INTC) , the worldâ€™s largest
chipmaker, said a fire in a chemical storage building injured
seven people at its plant in  Chandler , Arizona.  Four people were hospitalized, one with serious injuries,
said Bill Calder, a spokesman for Intel. While one building --
called Fab 32 -- was evacuated as a precaution, there was no
effect on production, Calder said.  Intel plants, which are largely automated, churn out
hundreds of millions of chips a year and run 24 hours a day. The
multibillion-dollar factories are most vulnerable to power
outages, which can disrupt a manufacturing process that takes up
to three months from start to finish, as recently seen in damage
to facilities in  Japan  caused by the earthquake and tsunami.  Santa Clara, California-based Intel operates U.S. factories
in Arizona,  New Mexico  and Oregon. It also has facilities in
Ireland and Israel and is building its first production base in
China.  Intel shares rose 23 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $22.06 at 4
p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has gained 4.9
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
