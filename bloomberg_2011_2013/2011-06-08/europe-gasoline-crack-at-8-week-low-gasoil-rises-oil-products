Vitol Group and Morgan Stanley bought
jet fuel in northwest  Europe . Mercuria Energy Trading SA
purchased cargoes of ultra-low-sulfur diesel.  Gasoil prices on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange
gained. The fuel’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , shrank.
Gasoline’s premium to Brent dropped to an eight-week low.  Light Products  The front-month gasoline crack fell to $6.14 a barrel
compared with $6.74 yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., an oil and refined products broker in London. That’s the
lowest since April 11.  Gasoline for immediate loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp area traded from $1,032 a metric ton to $1,035 a ton,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with trades yesterday from
$1,024 to $1,033 a ton.  The trades are for so-called Eurobob grade, to which
ethanol is added before being sold to motorists.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent widened to $8.23 a barrel from
$7.75 yesterday, according to PVM data. That’s the widest since
March 15.  Middle Distillates  Vitol bought 27,000 tons of jet fuel from BP Plc, priced
for delivery to the French port of  Le Havre  from June 21 to June
25, according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring
the Platts pricing window which ends at 4:30 p.m. in London.
Vitol also purchased a barge lot of jet fuel at $1,050 a ton.  Morgan Stanley bought a barge of the fuel at a premium of
$82 a ton to June ICE gasoil and another at $77 more than the
July gasoil contract, according to the survey. Yesterday, a

premium of $32 a ton to June ICE gasoil, priced for delivery to
Le Havre, the survey showed. Vitol purchased as much as 30,000
tons of the fuel at a premium of $38 a ton to July ICE gasoil.  Gasoil for June delivery added 2.2 percent to $975 a ton on
the ICE exchange as of 5:22 p.m. London time. That contract’s
premium to July widened to $4.25, the widest between the two
since Feb. 18.  A market is described as being in contango when cargoes
closest to delivery cost less than those expiring later. This
usually signals easing demand or rising supply. Gasoil is mainly
used in heating.  Gasoil barges traded at discounts of $1 to $3 a ton to June
ICE gasoil, the survey of Platts showed. That compares with
yesterday’s trades from 50 cents to $1.50 below the gasoil
futures contract.  Residues  High sulfur  fuel oil  barges traded from $640 to $642 a ton,
according to the Platts survey. Fuel oil is used to power ships
