Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ’s stake in  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  will fall to 3.8 percent because it’s not
participating in the share sale of Italy’s second-biggest bank.  Credit Agricole, which owns 4.99 percent of Intesa, sold
its rights to buy new shares in the Milan-based bank for 65
million euros ($95 million), Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Chifflet said at a presentation in Milan today. The French bank
intends to keep its stake in Intesa at that level “in the
future,” Chifflet said.  The French lender will freeze its voting rights in Intesa
at 2 percent starting July 1 to comply with a request from
Italy’s competition regulator, the CEO told reporters.  Credit Agricole sold rights to buy shares in Intesa’s 5
billion-euro capital increase on the market last week, Chifflet
said.  Intesa declined 1.1 percent to 1.79 euros as of 3:20 p.m.
local time giving the bank a market value of about 29.2 billion
euros.  Credit Agricole  traded down 0.2 percent at 10.32 euros in
