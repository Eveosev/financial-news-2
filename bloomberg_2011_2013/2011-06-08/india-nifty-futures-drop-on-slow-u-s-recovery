India’s benchmark stock index fell
for the first time in three days, tracking global equities,
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S.
economic recovery was “frustratingly slow.”  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s most valuable company,
dropped on report it may not be able to boost gas production.
 Asia ’s benchmark stock index headed for the lowest close since
May 25 after Bernanke’s comments fueled concerns about whether
the global recovery will be sustained.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) ,
a carmaker, declined 1.4 percent.  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (HH) , the
biggest motorcycle maker, plunged the most in seven weeks.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index lost 101.33, or
0.6 percent, to 18,394.29 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.
slid 0.5 percent to 5,526.85. The BSE 200 Index fell 0.4 percent
to 2,288.63.  “A slowdown concern in the U.S. is not good for global
equities,” said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP
Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi. “The Dow Jones index
is below its 100-day moving average and may decline further.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 1.1 percent at 7:25 a.m. in
 New York  and futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.5
percent.  The Sensex has lost 10 percent this year on concern higher
borrowing costs will crimp earnings. Rising consumer prices and
a 37 percent rally in oil costs the past year have forced the
central bank to raise  interest rates  nine times in 15 months.
The  Reserve Bank  of  India ’s next policy review is on June 16.  ‘Unwilling’  Overseas funds on June 6 sold a net 4.23 billion rupees
($95 million) of Indian stocks, Asia’s worst performers this
year. They pulled 66.14 billion rupees in May, the most in a
year. Local funds sold a net 1.94 billion rupees of equities in
the first seven days of June, after withdrawals of 7.2 billion
rupees in March and April, the data from the regulator show.  “Investors are unwilling to commit at this stage as local
concerns on inflation, interest rates and economic slowdown are
weighing on the markets,” Mathews said.  Reliance slid 0.9 percent to 949.2 rupees. The owner of the
world’s largest refining complex and its Canadian partner Niko
Resources Ltd. have told India’s oil ministry that they are
unable to raise gas output until 2014, Mint reported, citing
minutes of a May 2 meeting.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. fell 2.3 percent to 270.05 rupees
on speculation that a planned purchase may reduce profits. ONGC
and  GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL)  are in talks to buy part of  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) ’s stake in  Kazakhstan ’s Kashagan field, two people with
direct knowledge of the matter said. The start of production
from the field has been delayed to the end of 2012 from 2005.  Strike Extended  Maruti Suzuki fell 1.3 percent to 1,223.9 rupees and its
June futures settled at 1,218 rupees. India’s biggest carmaker
is losing 400 million rupees a day as workers extended their
strike at one of its factory, Chairman R.C. Bhargava said.  Hero Honda  plunged 3.8 percent to 1,763.9 rupees, its
fourth day of decline.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s biggest
lender, fell 1.1 percent to 2,294.9 rupees.  Housing Development
Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage lender, dropped 1.6 percent
to 658.3 rupees.  India’s rupee fell, ending a nine-day rally, on concern
global investors will slow purchases of emerging-market assets
amid recovery concerns in the world’s largest economy. Record
monetary stimulus is still needed to spur the U.S. recovery,
Bernanke said yesterday.  “The Bernanke comment has renewed concern about global
growth and soured sentiment across the financial market,” said
Vikas Babu, a Mumbai-based currency trader at state-run Andhra
Bank. “Equities are lower and there’s more demand for the
dollar’s safety.”  ‘Crucial Weeks’  The  World Bank  said inflation is a “key downside risk” to
growth in South Asia and called upon India,  Pakistan  and other
nations in the region to tighten their monetary and fiscal
policies. The region may expand 7.5 percent in 2011, slower than
the 9.3 percent gain in the previous year, it said.  “The next two weeks will be crucial for the Indian
markets,” said Shardul Kulkarni, technical analyst with Angel
Broking Ltd. “If the government hikes fuel prices and the
central bank raises rates, the Nifty may breach 5,000.”  A panel of ministers will meet June 9 to consider raising
domestic diesel prices, a government official, who asked not to
be identified, said last month.  ‘India Outperform’  Stocks on the Sensex are valued at an average 14.9 times
estimated profit, down from 21.5 times in March 2010. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index trades at 11 times earnings.  Still, Indian equities may “outperform” other stocks in
Asia, excluding  Japan , as prices already reflect concerns over
inflation and slowing growth, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
said in a report today.  The brokerage maintained its end-2011 estimate of 800 for
the MSCI India Index, compared with 730.1 at yesterday’s close.
That translates into 6,100 for the Nifty and 20,500 for the
Sensex, analyst Parul J. Saini said in the report.  Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) , India’s second-largest cell
phone operator, surged 2.4 percent to 94.25 rupees after the
 Carlyle Group  and TPG Capital were said to be among companies in
talks to buy a stake in Reliance’s mobile-phone towers unit,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
