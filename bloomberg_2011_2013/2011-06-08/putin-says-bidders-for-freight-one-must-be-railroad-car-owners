Russia  will prevent companies outside
the railroad industry from bidding for a controlling stake in
OAO Freight One, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said.  Putin said he backs a plan requiring bidders to have at
least 15,000 railroad cars after attempts were made to include a
broad range of candidates including banks and state companies.  “Such efforts shouldn’t be made,” he said today at a
meeting with Russia’s transport union in Moscow.  OAO Russian Railways, the state monopoly, plans to sell 75
percent minus two shares of its Freight One unit for at least
115.5 billion rubles ($4.2 billion), Deputy Prime Minister
Alexander Zhukov said in April.  The government will sign a decree on the sale on June 20,
Sergey Maltsev, chief executive office of Globaltrans Investment
Plc, Russia’s biggest non-state rail operator, said at the
meeting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
