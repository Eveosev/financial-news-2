Peru’s falling consumer prices and
slower credit growth means the central bank can refrain from
raising  interest rates  again when it meets tomorrow, Finance
Minister Ismael Benavides said.  “It’s the central bank’s decision but inflation is
negative and there’s nothing on the horizon in terms of imported
inflation,” Benavides said in an interview in  Lima  yesterday.
“There’s less demand for credit, which helps ease inflation.”  Consumer prices fell for the first time in seven months in
May and after inflation reached a three-year high in March as
food costs declined. Prices fell 0.02 percent from April and the
annual inflation rate slowed to 3.07 percent from 3.34 percent
the previous month. An easing of government spending growth and
increases in the benchmark rate have helped tame inflation,
Benavides said.  The central bank raised its benchmark rate to 4.25 percent
from 4 percent last month, its 10th increase in 13 meetings.
Bank policy makers will raise the rate by a quarter-point to
4.50 percent tomorrow, according to 11 of 15 of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Four economists expect the bank not to move.  Barclays Capital Inc. said in a June 6 e-mailed report to
investors that the central bank will keep rates unchanged and
will maintain the pause until the economic outlook is clearer in
the wake of Ollanta Humala’s victory in the country’s
presidential elections.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 6.69
percent at 10:35 a.m. New York time, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  Peru’s sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7845 per  U.S.
dollar  from 2.7865 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
