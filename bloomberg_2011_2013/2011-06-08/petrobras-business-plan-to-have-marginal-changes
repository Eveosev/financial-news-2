Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, will have “marginal changes” in
its 2011-2015 business plan, said Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli.  Investments “don’t change from one year to the next,”
Gabrielli told reporters today in Rio de Janeiro. “Alterations
will be marginal.” He declined to provide a date for the
release of the company’s revised five-year investment program.  Investors are concerned Petrobras will increase investments
in the new plan to expand gasoline production, a low-margin
business where the company’s refineries sell the fuel at prices
that haven’t changed for two years, said  Anisa Redman , an oil
and natural gas analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc in  New York .  “If Petrobras further raised capex guidance for refining,
the market would be disappointed,” Redman said in a telephone
interview yesterday.  Last year, Petrobras’s $224 billion in investments for the
five years through 2014 was the largest plan for an  oil company .  The company was considering a lower investment budget than
the one presented to the board in May, Chief Financial Officer
Almir Barbassa said on May 17. Petrobras didn’t disclose details
on the plan presented to the board.  Petrobras has reduced spending on deep-water exploration by
reducing the amount of time it takes to drill wells and
streamlining production equipment, Barbassa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
