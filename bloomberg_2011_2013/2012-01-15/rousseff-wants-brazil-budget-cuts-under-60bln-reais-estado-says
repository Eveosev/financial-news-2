Brazil â€™s President  Dilma Rousseff 
wants a smaller reduction in budget cuts than the finance
ministry calculates is needed to hit 2012 fiscal targets,  O
Estado de S.Paulo  newspaper reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  The ministry estimates that a 60 billion reais ($34
billion) reduction is necessary to achieve its goal of a  budget
surplus  before interest payments of 3.1 percent of gross
domestic product, while Rousseff seeks a smaller cut to conserve
investment spending, the newspaper said.  Rousseff has three meetings scheduled with ministers
between Jan. 19 and Jan. 21 to discuss the cuts, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
