Queens Park Rangers remain in the
relegation positions in English soccer’s Premier League after
 Mark Hughes  started his tenure with a 1-0 defeat at Newcastle.  Leon Best  got the only goal for Newcastle to lift the
Magpies above Liverpool into sixth, tied on points with Arsenal,
which is at Swansea in today’s other game.  QPR, which is 18th in the 20-team standings, appointed
Hughes on Jan. 10, two days after  Neil Warnock  was fired as
manager.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
