Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd.
raised 40 million euros ($50.7 million) in loan notes as it
seeks an additional 100 million euros to fund its business plan,
the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  “The company is also finalizing an equity fundraising, 13
million euros of which has already been invested by Irish high-
net-worth individuals through NCB Stockbrokers,” Mainstream
Renewable Power said.  Further funds from institutional investors, when combined
with the money already raised, will provide 100 million euros in
capital to fully fund the current business plan, Mainstream said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
