The new head of  Saudi Arabia ’s
religious police, Sheikh Abdul Latif al-Asheikh, supports the
right of women to work as long as their “dignity is preserved
in accordance with Islamic teachings,”  Arab News  reported.  The kingdom’s religious police, also known as the General
Presidency for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of
Vice, plan to form a department to provide job opportunities for
women, the Jeddah-based newspaper said, citing al-Asheikh.  King Abdullah  appointed al-Asheikh as the head of the
religious police, replacing Sheikh Abdulaziz al-Hummayin, the
official Saudi Press Agency reported on Jan. 13.
