Ezz Steel (ESRS) ,  Egypt ’s biggest publicly
traded manufacturer of the metal, headed for the biggest gain
since June 2009 after reports that the company reached an
agreement with the government to keep court-revoked licenses.  Shares of the Cairo-based company jumped 9.8 percent, near
the maximum daily limit of 10 percent and the most since Nov.
29, to 4.48 Egyptian pounds at 1:27 p.m. in Cairo. The stock
slumped 81 percent in 2011. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index  gained
1.6 percent today.  The government has proposed that four companies, including
Ezz Steel, pay a combined 1.47 billion pounds ($240 million) in
return for their licenses, Al Shorouk reported Jan. 12. The
companies will be allowed to pay 15 percent up front and the
rest over five years, the Cairo-based newspaper said. Ezz will
need to pay 660 million pounds for the two licenses affected by
the ruling, the newspaper said.  Egypt’s administrative court revoked the licenses because
of irregularities in the awarding process. Kamel Galal, Ezz’s
head of  investor relations , didn’t respond to a call and text
message to his mobile phone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
