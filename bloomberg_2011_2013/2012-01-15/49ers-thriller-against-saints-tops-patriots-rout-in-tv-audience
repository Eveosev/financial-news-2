The San Francisco 49ers’ last-minute
win against the  New Orleans Saints  grabbed a bigger share of the
television audience than the  New England Patriots ’ 45-10
primetime rout of the  Denver Broncos .  San Francisco’s afternoon game against the Saints two days
ago drew a 38 share,  Lou D’Ermilio , a spokesman for Fox, said in
an e-mail. The Patriots-Broncos matchup had a 34 share, CBS said
in an e-mailed statement.  The 49ers’ 36-32 victory was viewed by an average of 35.6
million people, making it the  National Football League ’s most-
watched Saturday divisional playoff game since at least 1988 and
perhaps the biggest audience ever for such a game, Fox said. The
lead changed hands four times in the final four minutes, two
seconds at Candlestick Park in  San Francisco .  The final 21 minutes of the Fox telecast averaged 40.6
million viewers, with the audience peaking at 42.5 million for
the end of the game at about 8:20 p.m. Eastern time.  San Francisco trailed 32-29 after Jimmy Graham caught a 66-
yard touchdown pass with 1:37 to play. 49ers quarterback Alex Smith, who had a 28-yard touchdown run with 2:11 left, then led
a winning 85-yard drive capped by a 14-yard scoring pass to
Vernon Davis with 9 seconds remaining.  The matchup between the Patriots and Broncos drew the
highest overnight rating and share for a primetime second-round
playoff game in 11 years, CBS said.  The broadcast had a 20.6 rating, CBS said, while the 49ers’
win had a 20.5 overnight rating, D’Ermilio said. CBS spokesman
Gerard Caraccioli said in an e-mail the network didn’t have
average audience numbers for the Patriots’ win.  Television ratings for yesterday’s playoff games, including
the  New York Giants ’ 37-20 upset win against the host  Green Bay
Packers  at Lambeau Field, likely will be released today.  Brady’s Blitz  Tom Brady threw five first-half touchdown passes for the
Patriots, who led 35-7 at halftime in the Jan. 14 playoff game.
CBS’s ratings and share peaked at 24.1 and 39 between 9 p.m. and
9:30 p.m. Eastern time for the game, which kicked off at 8 p.m.
Eastern time, the broadcaster said.  The matchup between Brady and Broncos quarterback  Tim Tebow 
was thought to have a chance to draw a record audience, media
researchers said. Denver’s 29-23 overtime victory against the
Pittsburgh Steelers a week ago averaged 42.4 million viewers on
CBS, a wild-card playoff game record.  Ratings are the percentage of homes with televisions tuned
into a program, while share is the percentage of homes that have
televisions in use at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
