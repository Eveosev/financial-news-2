German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  renewed his rejection of joint euro region bond sales
and said giving the  European Central Bank  the role of lender of
last resort wouldn’t calm markets permanently.  “If the central bank finances government debt, it’s a
modern form of the old bad habit that if the government doesn’t
have enough money, it prints money,” Schaeuble said today in
Berlin. “If we start doing this, markets will calm down for
some time. But then they realize that the European currency is
not a stable currency” in the long run.  Selling  government bonds  jointly in the euro region isn’t a
solution to the euro region’s debt crisis because it would mean
that governments “can pile up debt without being liable for
it,” Schaeuble also said in Berlin after attending the
screening of a documentary on the region’s woes.  Germany  was left with the euro-area’s only stable AAA
rating as S&P stripped France and Austria of their top credit
grades, citing “insufficient” policy steps to combat the debt
crisis. Germany and France are pushing for stricter budget rules
as the bedrock of European governments’ response to the debt
crisis that emerged in  Greece  in late 2009 and is now buffeting
Spain and Italy.  “We wouldn’t solve the problem,” Schaeuble said,
referring to joint bond sales and relying on the central bank to
finance state debt. “The countries must reduce their debts. We
can talk about the speed at which this has to be achieved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
