Natural gas prices are still a
“challenge” for developing  Saudi Arabia ’s unconventional gas
deposits such as shale and tight gas, said Khalid al-Falih, the
head of Saudi Arabian Oil Co.  Natural gas prices are low, making developing the deposits
economically unfeasible, he told reporters yesterday in Dhahran,
Saudi Arabia. “We are hoping that this will be addressed by the
government in due course.”  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, sells gas
locally at a subsidized price of 75 cents per million British
thermal units. Gas declined 1 percent to $2.67 per million Btu
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  Jan. 13, the lowest
settlement price since Sept. 3, 2009. The futures have declined
39 percent from a year ago.  Saudi Aramco , as the state oil company is known, has a
major exploration program for unconventional gas, al-Falih said.
The company is drilling a number of wells including shale and
tight gas in the northwest of the country, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
