Iran  plans to build its first
privately financed oil-export terminal at a port on the nation‘s
western coast, the state-run  Mehr  news agency reported, citing
the managing director of National Iranian Oil Terminals Co.  The facility, to begin operation by the end of 2015, will
have a storage capacity for crude oil of more than 8 million
barrels, Pirouz Mousavi said, according to Mehr. The project
will cost about 1,300 trillion rials ($115 million) and be built
at the Persian Gulf port of Genaveh in Bushehr province, the
agency reported today.  International sanctions against Iran over its nuclear
program have discouraged foreign investment in the country‘s
energy industries. The report did not identify the builder or
the source of financing for the export terminal. Iran is the
second-largest oil producer in OPEC after  Saudi Arabia , pumping
3.575 million barrels a day in December, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
