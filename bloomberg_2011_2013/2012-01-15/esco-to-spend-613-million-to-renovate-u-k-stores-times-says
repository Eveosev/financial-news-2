Tesco Plc (TSCO)  will spend as much as 400
million pounds ($613 million) to renovate its U.K. stores and
hire more staff this year, the  Sunday Times  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer  Philip Clarke .  “What we’ve seen over time is Tesco’s underperformance
against the market in like-for-like terms -- the lifeblood of
the retail business, the real measure,” Clarke said, according
to the Sunday Times. “I want to put that right.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
