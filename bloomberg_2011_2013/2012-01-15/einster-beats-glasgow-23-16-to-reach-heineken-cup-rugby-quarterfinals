Defending champion Leinster won 23-
16 at  Glasgow Warriors  to become the second team to reach the
quarterfinals of European rugby’s Heineken Cup. Saracens
defeated Biarritz 20-16 to close on a spot in the last eight.  Rob Kearney and Isaac Boss got tries as Leinster guaranteed
it would  top Pool 3  and advance along with fellow Irish team
Munster, which is assured of winning Pool 1. Fergus McFadden
kicked 10 points.  Leinster is aiming to become the second team after
Leicester in 2001 and 2002 to win the competition in successive
years.  Owen Farrell, who was among a number of uncapped players
included this week in England’s squad for the Six Nations,
kicked five penalties as Saracens won today in Pool 5. One point
against Benetton Treviso next weekend will secure the English
club’s spot in the next stage.  Yesterday, Munster defeated Castres 26-10. Record four-time
champion Toulouse tops Pool 6, Ulster leads Pool 4, while
 Cardiff Blues  and Edinburgh are tied on points atop Pool 2 with
one round of group games to play.  To contact the reporter on this story:
