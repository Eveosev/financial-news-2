European Union proposals a minimum
of 12  member states  to ratify the region’s fiscal deal mean it
can proceed without Irish support and it’s in the country’s
interest to participate, European Affairs Minister Lucinda Creighton told the Sunday Business Post in an interview.  “This threshold will allow others to go ahead with closer
integration, so it is therefore in our in interest to be part of
it,” the Dublin-based paper quoted Creighton as saying. She
said that not being part of the agreement would “inevitably”
raise question about Ireland’s membership of the euro, the
Sunday Business Post reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
