London & Stamford Property Plc  is
selling its stake in U.K. shopping center Meadowhall, the Sunday
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  London &  Stamford , which owns half of Meadowhall with a
Middle Eastern partner, asked Savills Plc to start marketing the
property in the next few months with a price tag of more than
1.6 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), the Sunday Times said.
British Land Co., which owns the rest of Meadowhall, is also
considering selling, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
