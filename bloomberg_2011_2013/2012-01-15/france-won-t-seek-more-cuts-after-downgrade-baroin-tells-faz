France  will not implement any
further cost-saving measures after its debt was downgraded by
ratings agency  Standard & Poor’s , Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  told the  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung .  France will concentrate on structural reforms to improve
competitiveness and reduce labor costs, Baroin told the FAZ.  Baroin doesn’t see the Jan. 13 downgrade as having any
effect on the drawing up of the European Stability Mechanism or
the existing European Financial Stability Facility, citing the
effect that the downgrading of  U.S. debt  had on its borrowing
costs, FAZ reported.  The financial transaction tax will still be introduced in
the face of opposition from the junior German coalition partner,
the Free Democrats, Baroin told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
