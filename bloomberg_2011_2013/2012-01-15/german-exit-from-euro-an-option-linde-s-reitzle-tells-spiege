Germany  should leave the euro
currency zone if the so-called crisis countries fail to carry
out reforms to reduce their debt burden,  Der Spiegel  said,
citing an  interview  with  Linde AG (LIN)  Chief Executive Officer
Wolfgang Reitzle.  While an exit would lead to higher unemployment in the
short-term, it would increase competitiveness in the longer
term, putting Germany on a par with Asian competitors within
five years, Reitzle told Spiegel, adding the move was not his
preferred option.  A Europe-wide recession lasting several years would see
Linde’s annual revenue at 9 billion euros ($11.4 billion) rather
than 13 billion euros and its main markets would be in Asia,
Reitzle told the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
