Lots of first growth Bordeaux,
including  Chateau Lafite-Rothschild  and  Chateau Margaux , went
unsold in a $18.7 million test of demand for fine wine.  Wealthy Chinese and other collectors focused on the very
best older vintages and Burgundies such as DRC Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti at  Hong Kong  weekend auctions, passing on other
lots in anticipation of further price declines this year.  “This is an opportunity to average down,” said Sam Lin, a
collector for more than 20 years, who on Jan. 14 picked up six
magnums of Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1990 at Sotheby’s for
HK$26,000 ($3,348) before buyer’s premium -- well below the low
estimate of HK$34,000. “In general, today was cheap but I think
there will still be a correction.”  Auction buying became more selective last year, as the  Liv-
ex Fine Wine 100 Index  dropped 15 percent. First-half price
gains for Bordeaux were followed by declines in the latter part
of 2011. Values may fall further before rebounding, buyers said.  “The market is waiting to find a level,” said Robert Sleigh, senior director and head of wine for  Asia  at  Sotheby’s (BID) 
in Hong Kong. “The amount sold in the past two or three years
is historically extraordinary and everyone is taking a
breather.”  For example, six lots of Chateau-Lafite 2003 went unsold.  “Younger first growths and right bank wines were
struggling to find a home,” said Sleigh.  The Sotheby’s sale of almost 1,000 lots raised HK$44.06
million, accounting for 82.1 percent of the presale estimate,
while 85 percent of the lots sold.  Top Lots  The most expensive Sotheby’s lot was a 12-bottle case of
1990 DRC Romanee Conti that sold for HK$1.84 million, including
a buyer’s premium of 22.5 percent. Across town at the  Acker
Merrill & Condit   sale, the most expensive lot was also a case
of 1985 DRC, costing HK$1.464 million with buyer’s premium.  Acker, the largest wine auction house by sales, raised
HK$66.87 million, with more than 90 percent of almost 1,000 lots
sold.  “Despite the distractions of economic uncertainty, Chinese
New Year and record volume in the wine auction market,” John Kapon, the company’s chief executive officer, said in a news
release last night, “buyers still showed that they want their
fine and rare wine,”  One of the highlights of the Acker sale was the HK$488,000
paid for a rare bottle of 1870 Chateau Lafite harvested during
the Franco-Prussian war. It has been kept at the Chateau until
sold in 2003 and shipped to the U.S.  Smaller Value  Together with the HK$34.62 million raised by  Zachys  during
its Jan. 7 sale, the three auction houses have sold a combined
$HK145.54 million (equivalent of $18.71 million) in sales
leading up to Chinese New Year celebrations. This figure is well
below the combined $34.59 million total raised by the same three
events in January 2011.  Hong Kong is the world’s largest wine auction market and is
closely watched as a barometer of global sentiment. Last year,
$198 million of wine was sold by the four biggest auction houses
in the city, more than double the $92 million they sold in  New
York , the second-largest center, according to Bloomberg News
calculations.  While the wine market in Hong Kong is dominated by French
red Bordeaux and Burgundy wines, auctioneers have been finding
success at selling some American wines. A 42-bottle lot of seven
vintages of Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon fetched
HK$829,600 at Acker Merrall & Condit, while Harlan Estate of
 Napa Valley  sold well at Sotheby’s, dealers said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
