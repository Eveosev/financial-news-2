Hansueli Raggenbass, head of the
 Swiss central bank ’s supervisory board, expressed a willingness
to serve another term in the position, according to an interview
with  Der Sonntag .  “If it is in the interest of the national bank, then I am
available,” he told the Aarau-based newspaper.  A successor to the  Swiss National Bank ’s former chairman
may be appointed before May, Raggenbass said. Philipp Hildebrand
announced his resignation on Jan. 9, after failing to prove his
wife acted independently on a currency purchase of $504,000, a
month before the bank imposed a cap on the Swiss franc.  “We have a list with possible names, and the first meeting
of the committee for the appointment have already taken place,”
Raggenbass said, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
