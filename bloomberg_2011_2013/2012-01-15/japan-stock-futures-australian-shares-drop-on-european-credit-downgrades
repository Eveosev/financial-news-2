Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities fell after  Standard & Poor’s  stripped France
of its top credit rating and cut eight other euro-zone nations,
boosting concern the region’s debt crisis may worsen.  American depositary receipts of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s top publicly traded bank, fell 1.2 percent
from the closing share price in  Tokyo . Those of  Kyocera Corp. (6971) ,
an electronics maker that gets almost 20 percent of its sales in
 Europe , slid 0.7 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No. 1
oil producer and the world’s biggest mining company by market
value, slipped 1.1 percent in Sydney after commodity prices
dropped.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 8,460 in Chicago on Jan. 13, up from 8,500 in
 Osaka ,  Japan . They were bid in the pre-market at 8,430 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 1
percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.2 percent in
Wellington.  “People in the market has been expecting downgrades of
France and other European countries, but they can’t tell how
much the downgrades have already been priced in, which will
likely drag down stocks” said Norihiko Funatsu, a chief
strategist in Tokyo at Okasan Securities Co.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.3 percent
today. The index lost 0.5 percent in New York on Jan. 13. After
the market closed, S&P said France was downgraded, while  Germany 
had its  credit rating  affirmed.  ‘No Breakthrough’  Germany, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg and
the Netherlands had their ratings affirmed by S&P as France lost
its AAA rating. France was cut to AA+ and the rating has a
negative outlook, S&P said in a statement. Cyprus, Italy,
Portugal and Spain were cut two grades, S&P said. The long-term
ratings on Austria, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia were cut one
level.  Attempts by European leaders to address economic woes
haven’t “produced a breakthrough of sufficient size and scope
to fully address the euro zone’s financial problems,” S&P said.
The region continues to face tightening credit conditions among
other problems, S&P said.  The euro weakened for a second day, reaching an 11-year low
versus the yen. The shared currency depreciated to 97.20 yen on
Jan. 14, which matched its lowest level since December 2000.  Concern about potential downgrades overshadowed data
showing that confidence among U.S. consumers rose more than
forecast in January to the highest level in eight months, a sign
household spending may hold up early this year. Separate figures
showed that the U.S.  trade deficit  widened more than forecast in
November as American exports declined and companies stepped up
imports of crude oil and automobiles.  Oil Falls  Crude oil for February delivery fell 0.4 percent to $98.70
a barrel in  New York  on Jan. 13, the lowest settlement since
Dec. 21. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
metals including copper and aluminum lost 0.3 percent, its first
drop since Jan. 5.  The Bloomberg  China-US 55 Index  of the most-actively traded
Chinese equities slipped 0.7 percent to 99.61 on Jan. 13.
 China’s economy  probably grew the least in 10 quarters in the
last three months of 2011 and may cool further as export demand
slumps and officials prolong a campaign against property
bubbles.  Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced, rose 8.7 percent from a year earlier, the slowest pace
since the second quarter of 2009, according to the  median
forecast  of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The data,
plus indicators for investment, retail sales and industrial
production, are scheduled to be released tomorrow in Beijing.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 2.7 percent this year
through Jan. 13, compared with a 2.5 percent gain by the  S&P 500 
and a 1.9 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.3 times for the S&P 500
and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  In Japan, the government is scheduled to release a report
on machinery orders at 8:50 a.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
