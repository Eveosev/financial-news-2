South Africa  will send 150 more
rangers to Kruger National Park to clamp down on rhino poachers,
South African Press Association said.  The additional rangers will work with the 500 personnel
already at the park, the Johannesburg-based  news agency 
reported, citing Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa.
South Africa arrested 232 people for rhino poaching, SAPA
reported, without giving a time period.  Poachers killed 448 of the animals last year in South
Africa and 11 so far this year, the news agency reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
