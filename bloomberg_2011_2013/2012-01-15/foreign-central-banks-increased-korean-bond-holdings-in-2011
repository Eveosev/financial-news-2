Foreign central banks and state-run
funds increased their holdings of  South Korea ’s local-currency
bonds by 86 percent last year, according to data released today
by the  Financial Supervisory Service .  They owned 28.3 trillion won ($24.7 billion) of the
securities at the end of 2011, up from 15.2 trillion won at the
end of the previous year, the regulator said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Malaysian investors were the biggest buyers, boosting
ownership by 3.7 trillion won, the FSS said. Funds based in
 China  and  Kazakhstan  followed, adding 3.66 trillion won and 2.2
trillion won, respectively. Total foreign investment in won and
dollar-denominated Korean bonds increased 9 percent last year to
83 trillion won, according to the regulator.  Korean Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said on Jan. 9 that
overseas central banks’ demand for the nation’s debt is growing
and the government will work with them to limit volatility in
capital flows, Yonhap Infomax reported.  The won weakened 2.3 percent against the dollar last year
and the benchmark five-year bond  yield  fell 62 basis points to
3.46 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
