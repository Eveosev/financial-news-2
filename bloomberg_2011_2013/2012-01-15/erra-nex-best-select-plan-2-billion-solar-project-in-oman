Swiss-based Terra Nex Financial
Engineering AG and German-based Middle East Best Select Group of
Funds plan a $2 billion solar-energy project in the Sultanate of
Oman, Sheikh Khalid bin Hilal bin Nasser al Mawali, a partner in
the project, said in a presentation today.  The project includes the construction of a 400-megawatt
power plant as well as factories to make solar panels and
aluminum frames, Mawali said at a presentation in the Oman
capital, Muscat. Middle East Best has created a private-
investment fund called Solar Energy-Photovoltaik with an initial
investment of $200 million to finance the first solar power
station, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
