The first of four new Iraqi single-
point mooring facilities will be ready to start pumping oil for
tankers on Jan. 25, said Dhia Jaafar, director general of South
Oil Co.  The project involves laying pipelines, eight  storage tanks 
and three other mooring facilities, he said in an e-mailed
statement today. Each of the four facilities will add 900,000
barrels a day of exporting capacity for crude oil, Hussain al-
Shahristani, deputy prime minister for energy affairs, said Dec.
22.  Iraq holds the world’s fifth-largest crude deposits
including Canadian  oil sands , according to BP Plc. The Middle
East country’s crude exports rose 1.9 percent in December to an
average 2.175 million barrels a day, Falah al-Amri, head of the
State Oil Marketing Organization, said Dec. 18.  The government is seeking foreign investment to raise
production and exports to promote economic growth. It has
granted 15 oil and gas licenses since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion
that ousted former President  Saddam Hussein .  To contact the reporter on this story:
