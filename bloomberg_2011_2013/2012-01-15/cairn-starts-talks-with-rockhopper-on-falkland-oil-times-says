Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  is in talks with
Rockhopper Exploration Plc, the U.K. company that discovered oil
near the Falkland Islands off Argentina, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Rockhopper has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch to find
a partner to share development costs and the auction may lead to
a takeover, the Sunday Times said, citing unidentified bankers.  Cairn Energy doesnâ€™t comment on rumors, a spokesman, who
declined to be identified citing company policy, told Bloomberg
News by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
