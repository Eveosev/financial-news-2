The  Swiss National Bank  wants to
appoint a successor to former Chairman Philipp Hildebrand within
three months, SonntagsZeitung said, citing an  interview  with
Hansueli Raggenbass, head of the supervisory board.  Hildebrand announced his resignation on Jan. 9 after
failing to prove his wife acted independently on a currency
purchase of $504,000, a month before the bank imposed a cap on
the Swiss franc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
