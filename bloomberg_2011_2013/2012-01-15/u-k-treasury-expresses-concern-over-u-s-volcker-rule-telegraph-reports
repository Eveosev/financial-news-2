The U.K. Treasury has challenged
U.S. regulators over the so-called Volcker Rule barring
proprietary trading at banks, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  U.K. officials have said a ban may curb liquidity in
government-bond markets as banks reduce trading on their own
accounts, the newspaper reported, without saying where it
obtained the information. It cited Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
President  Gary Cohn  as saying that the Volcker Rule might mean
“liquidity in all markets will dry up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
