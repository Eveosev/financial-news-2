Ireland’s Social Protection Minister
 Joan Burton  said a second bailout for the country can’t be ruled
out until the euro-area debt crisis is resolved, the  Sunday
Independent  reported, citing an interview.  “If the euro-zone crisis hadn’t emerged a couple of months
ago I would have been able to give a much tighter prediction,”
Burton said, according to the newspaper. “If we were to get
access to the collective financial power of the euro zone then
we would be in a much better position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
