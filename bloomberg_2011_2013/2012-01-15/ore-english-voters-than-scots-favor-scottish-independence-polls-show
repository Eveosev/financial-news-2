More English voters than Scots favor
independence for  Scotland , two opinion polls showed.  43 percent of voters in  England  approve of Scotland
becoming independent, compared to 40 percent north of the
border, according to a survey by ICM for the Sunday Telegraph. A
poll by Survation for the Mail on Sunday found 29 percent of
those asked in England said Scotland should quit the U.K. with
26 percent of Scots saying the same.  The Scottish National Party administration in Edinburgh and
the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in  London 
are at odds over the timing of a referendum on independence,
what questions should be included in the ballot, who should be
allowed to vote and who should supervise it.  Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond wants to hold the
vote in the second half of 2014, while the U.K. government wants
it earlier. Talks are scheduled for this week.  In an interview with the Observer, former U.K. Chancellor
of the Exchequer Alistair Darling, who represents a Scottish
constituency, said choosing independence would be “fraught with
risk” when it came to selecting a currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
