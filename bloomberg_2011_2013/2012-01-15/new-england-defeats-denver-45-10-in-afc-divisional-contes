Tom Brady threw for six touchdowns
to lead the  New England Patriots  to a 45-10 victory over the
Denver Broncos in an American Football Conference divisional
game at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachussets.  Brady tied the National Football League record for touchdown
passes in a postseason game. He connected three times with  Rob
Gronkowski , who also matched an NFL record.  The Patriots, who haven’t won a playoff game since 2007,
will play the winner of tomorrow’s AFC matchup between the
Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
