Germany ’s Finance Ministry estimated
the national debt burden fell to 79 percent of gross domestic
product last year on lower-than-expected bad bank debts,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said in a preview of an article
to be published tomorrow.  The newspaper cited Deputy Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter. Bad bank debts dropped to 8.3 percent of GDP,
according to a written answer by Kampeter to questions posed by
 Otto Fricke  of the Free Democratic Party, the FAZ said.  Kampeter said there was growth of 3 percent and 2.5 percent
inflation, while new debt represented 1 percent of GDP,
according to the paper.  Hypo Real Estate and Westdeutsche Landesbank were the two
lenders whose debts were lower than anticipated, the FAZ
reported. The figures should be confirmed at the end of the
current quarter, according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
