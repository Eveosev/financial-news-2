The  New York Rangers  shut out the
Toronto Maple Leafs 3-0 to hold on to the National Hockey
League-leading record of 28-10 this season.  After a scoreless first period last night, Mike Rupp and
Brian Boyle each had goals in the second period, and Derek Stepan added the third in the final period at Air Canada Centre
in Toronto.  Martin Biron had 19 saves for the Rangers, who lead the
five-team Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division.  The Maple Leafs fell to 22-17 to place third in the Eastern
Conference’s Northeast Division behind the  Boston Bruins  and
Ottawa Senators.  Toronto’s seventh place in the conference is threatened by
the Washington Capitals and  Pittsburgh Penguins , who are in
striking distance of knocking the Maple Leafs out of the
playoffs with victories today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
