Ireland’s government and the troika
of the European Union,  European Central Bank  and  International
Monetary Fund  remain deadlocked in talks over the sale of state
assets, the  Sunday Independent  reported.  Ireland is resisting pressure from the trio to double asset
sales to 4 billion euros ($5.1 billion) during the government’s
current term of office, the Dublin-based newspaper reported
today, citing an unidentified person familiar with the
discussions. The nation wants most of any funds raised to go
into job creation programs, while the troika says the money
should be used to pay down debt immediately, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
