Tom Stephens, chief technology
officer and a vice chairman for  General Motors Co. (GM) , will retire
April 1, the company said.  Stephens, 63, has been vice chairman and global technology
head since February 2011, the Detroit-based automaker said in a
statement today. Before assuming that role, he served as vice
chairman of global production operations from April 2009 to
February 2011.  The retiring technology chief has been with General Motors
since 1969 and followed Bob Lutz as head of global product
development until being replaced by Mary Barra in February 2011.  Stephens helped lead the development of the first Cadillac
Northstar engine for GM and was instrumental in the companyâ€™s
engine technology efforts, including hybrid vehicles and the
Chevrolet Volt, the company said.  When he first came to General Motors, Stephens was an
hourly employee at the Chevrolet Engineering Center in Warren,
 Michigan , under the University of Michigan Student Co-op
Program.  He later held engineering posts at Cadillac and the Buick-
Oldsmobile-Cadillac division before being tapped to head the GM
Powertrain division, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
