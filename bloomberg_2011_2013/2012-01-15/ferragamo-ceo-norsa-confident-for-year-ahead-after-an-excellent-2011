Salvatore Ferragamo (SFER)  SpA, an Italian
luxury goods maker, is “confident” for 2012 after an
“excellent” 2011, which included better-than-expected holiday
sales, Chief Executive Officer  Michele Norsa  said today at the
company’s men’s fashion show in Milan.  The euro’s weakening against dollar is an advantage for
Ferragamo, making it more competitive and boosting margins at
the Florence, Italy-based company, Norsa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
