Branden Grace won the Joburg Open by
one stroke after an even-par final round today to claim a first
title on golf’s European Tour.  The 23-year-old South African finished on 17-under at the
Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club, with  England ’s
Jamie Elson taking second after shooting a nine-under round.  “It’s a dream come true,” Grace told reporters. “It’s nice
to win in front of a home crowd and I wouldn’t exchange it for
anything else.  Grace, playing his 50th European Tour event, had never
previously finished a tournament on the circuit higher than
sixth.  Six players tied for third, including Scotland’s David
Drysdale and Marc Warren along with four South Africans.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
