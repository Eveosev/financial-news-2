Premier  Wen Jiabao  said  China  will
increase support and protection for agriculture, according to
the government’s website.  Wen said protection of farmers’ land property rights is key
to advancing the reform on collective land requisition,
according to a  commentary  written by Wen for Qiushi magazine.
He also wrote that the nation should emphasize infrastructure
constructions on rural areas.  Land seizures in the southern Chinese town of Wukan, which
led villagers to kick out local leaders, stem from “abuses of
power” by Communist Party cadres, Li Song, head of the party’s
discipline committee in the southern city of Huizhou, wrote in
an essay in the state-controlled People’s Daily on Jan. 10.  -- Judy Chen ,  John Liu . Editor:  Mike Anderson .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
