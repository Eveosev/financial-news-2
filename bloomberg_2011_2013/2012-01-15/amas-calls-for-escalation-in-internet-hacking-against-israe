The Palestinian Hamas movement
called for an escalation of Internet hacking against  Israel ,
saluting Arab programmers who have managed to infiltrate Israeli
computer systems.  “Penetrating Israeli websites means opening a new field of
resistance and the beginning of an electronic war against
Israeli occupation,” Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said today
in a statement e-mailed to reporters in the Gaza Strip.  In recent weeks, computer hackers claiming to be from Saudi
Arabia obtained and publicly posted the confidential information
of Israeli citizens, including credit-card details. Israeli
Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  established a National Cyber
Directorate in August to guard against infiltration of the
country’s government and business computer systems.  Hamas, which controls Gaza, is considered a terrorist
organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
