Queens Park Rangers is “getting
close” to signing 20-year-old Brazilian striker Henrique from
 Sao Paulo ,  the Guardian reported , citing an unnamed executive at
the Premier League soccer club.  Henrique, Brazil’s top scorer as the nation won this year’s
Under-20 World Cup, is likely to join on loan until the end of
the season with view to a 5 million-pound ($7.7 million) move in
the summer, the newspaper said.  The striker is unsettled at Sao Paulo and the Guardian
cited the Brazilian team’s head coach Emerson Leao as saying
that Henrique “could leave tomorrow or any time soon.”  QPR manager  Mark Hughes  also wants to sign Chelsea center-
back Alex and Manchester City fullback Wayne Bridge, the
Guardian reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
