JPMorgan Chase & Co.  could lose some
$5 billion from its investments in southern  Europe  should the
euro-region crisis deteriorate significantly, Welt am Sonntag
reported, citing an interview with the company’s chief executive
officer,  Jamie Dimon .  Such a loss, which would represent around 30 percent of its
total $16 billion invested in the region, would “damage us but
not kill us,” Welt  cited  Dimon as saying. The company hasn’t
reduced its investments in Portugal, Italy, Ireland,  Greece  or
Spain, he said.  Dimon said there was a 60 percent chance of Europe pulling
through the crisis, according to the newspaper. The euro is
Europe’s greatest achievement of the last century, he said,
urging member states not to return to their national currencies,
Welt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
