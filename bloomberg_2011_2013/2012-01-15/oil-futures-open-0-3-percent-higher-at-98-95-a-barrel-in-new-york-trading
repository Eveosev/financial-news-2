Oil climbed from the lowest price in
almost four weeks as  Iran  said that a disruption to crude
supplies through the  Strait of Hormuz  would cause a shock to
markets that “no country” could manage.  Futures rose as much as 0.6 percent after sliding 2.8
percent last week. Iran has threatened to shut the strait, a
transit route for about a fifth of global oil trade, in response
to international sanctions on its exports. Any disruption will
harm the world’s crude markets, Iran’s governor to OPEC said,
according to the state-run Mehr news agency.  “We are seeing a rebound primarily due to geopolitical
supply-side concerns,” said  Victor Shum , a senior principal at
Purvin & Gertz Inc., a consultant in  Singapore . “There is no
let down in the continuing war of words involving Iran.”  Crude for February delivery rose as much as 60 cents to
$99.30 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $99.19 at 4:03 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract fell 0.4 percent to $98.70 on Jan. 13, the lowest close
since Dec. 21. There will be no floor trading in  New York  today
because of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.  Brent oil for February settlement was at $111.40 a barrel,
up 90 cents on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract expires today. The more actively traded March futures
rose $1.01 to $111.36 a barrel. The European benchmark
contract’s premium to West Texas Intermediate futures was at
$12.20, compared with a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Oil in New York is rebounding today after reaching
technical support along the 50-day moving average, around $98.74
a barrel today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buy
orders tend to be clustered near chart-support levels.  Nigeria ’s main labor unions suspended protests over the
removal of fuel-import subsidies, Trade Union Congress President
Peter Esele said by telephone. The country’s leader Goodluck
Jonathan agreed to lower gasoline prices to 97 naira a liter in
a speech e-mailed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
