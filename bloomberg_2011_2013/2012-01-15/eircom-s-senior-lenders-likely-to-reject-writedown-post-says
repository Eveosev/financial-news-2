A proposal from Eircom Group Ltd.’s
second-tier lenders to take a 250 million-euro ($317 million)
writedown on what they are owed isn’t likely to be accepted by
first-tier lenders, the  Sunday Business Post  reported.  The response from first-lien lenders has been “lukewarm”
and the plan will probably be rejected on the grounds it would
leave the company with too much debt, the Dublin-based paper
said today, citing unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
