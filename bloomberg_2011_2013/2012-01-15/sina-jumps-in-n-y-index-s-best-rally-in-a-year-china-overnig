Chinese stocks  in the U.S. rose for
a fourth week, the longest winning streak in a year, on
prospects  China  will take further steps to spur growth as the
threat of a global slowdown erodes the outlook for Asia’s
fastest growing economy.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index  rose 1 percent last week to
99.61 on Jan. 13 in New York, led by solar and Internet
companies.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  jumped 41 percent in the week as
China said it will double solar capacity in 2012.  Sina Corp. (SINA) 
surged 24 percent after at least eight analysts recommended
buying the stock.  China Southern Airlines Co. (ZNH)  traded at a
discount to its shares in Hong Kong for the first time this year
after the biggest slump in two months on Jan. 13.  China’s economy  probably slowed in the last quarter of
2011, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before data this week. Policy makers cut banks’
reserve-requirement ratios last month for the first time since
2008 and have kept  key interest rates  on hold since July.  Economic data in China “has actually pushed the market by
expecting further monetary easing in the form of cutting reserve
requirement ratios,”  Norman Chan , head of investment at Calibre
Asset Management Ltd. in  Hong Kong , said in a Jan. 13 interview
with Bloomberg Television. “On the valuation, China’s market
has suffered a bad year already. On a cyclical basis, there is a
good chance for them to rebound.”  European Downgrades  The Bloomberg China-US 55 index of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. dropped 0.7 percent on Jan. 13 after Standard
& Poor’s cut France’s AAA rating by one step, threatening
European policy makers efforts to recover from the region’s debt
crisis.  The ratings company also lowered the rankings of Cyprus,
 Italy , Portugal, and  Spain  by two notches and cut Austria,
Malta, Slovakia, and Slovenia by one level.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  declined 1.3 percent, the most
in a week, to 2,244.58 on Jan. 13, after climbing 3.8 percent
last week. The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  of U.S. stocks slid
0.5 percent to 1,282.74 on Jan. 13 for a gain of 0.9 percent
during the week.  The Shanghai index is trading at an  estimated price to
earnings ratio  of 9.2. That compares with a ratio of 14 for
Indian stocks, 9.3 for Brazilian shares and 5.4 for Russian
equities, the cheapest among the biggest  emerging markets .  Changzhou, China-based  Trina Solar  leaped 41 percent last
week, the most since March 2009, to $9.57. The company surged 29
percent on Jan. 11 following reports that China plans to develop
three gigawatts of solar capacity this year while  Germany 
installed three gigawatts of solar panels in December, the most
in a single month.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , China’s biggest
solar-panel maker, jumped 29 percent last week to $2.96.  Rally ‘Overdone’  The U.K. also saw installations surge in the final part of
2011 as the price of panels tumbled. Installations for the year
rose to 762 megawatts, 10 times the previous year’s total,
according to figures from the Ofgem energy regulator.  Gordon Johnson , the Axiom Capital Management Inc. analyst
who predicted “Armageddon” for the solar industry 14 months
ago, raised his recommendations for Trina, Suntech Power and
Yingli Green Energy Holdings Co. on Jan. 11.  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index  Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., advanced 4.5 percent last week
to $36.74, the most in six weeks. The yuan was little changed in
the five days to Jan. 13 at 6.3066 per dollar, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  The solar rally “feels overdone” as overcapacity remains
a major problem,  Pavel Molchanov , an analyst at Raymond James &
Associates Inc. wrote in a Jan. 13 research note.  Sina Upgrades  Sina, the Twitter-like service provider and owner of the
third-most visited website in China, climbed 24 percent to
$59.92 last week, the biggest weekly increase in three months.  Dick Wei, an analyst at JPMorgan Securities Ltd., raised
the stock to “overweight” from “neutral,” and set a 12-month
price target of $79. At least seven other analysts also
reiterated their recommendations to buy the stock last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company was the top pick among Chinese Internet firms
in 2012, C. Ming Zhao, a communications analyst at Susquehanna
International Group LLP, wrote in a Jan. 13 note.  American depositary receipts of China Southern,  Asia ’s
biggest air carrier by passenger numbers, tumbled 6.7 percent on
Jan. 13 to $27.74, the biggest drop since Oct. 31. The ADRs,
each representing 50 common shares, traded 0.3 percent lower
than the company’s Hong Kong-listed stock, the first day they’ve
offered a discount this year.  Slowing Growth  Passenger traffic for China Southern rose 5.3 percent in
2011 to 80.5 million, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Jan. 1,
citing an unidentified company spokesman. That was less than the
15.4 percent growth in 2010.  China Southern “still stands a better chance to lead its
peers in 2012 performance” even if the industry’s growth slows,
Bocom International Holdings said in a report on Jan. 13.  China, the world’s second-largest economy, expanded 9.1
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, down from 9.5
percent in the second quarter. Growth probably slowed to 8.7
percent in the last three months of 2011, according to the
median forecast of 27 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
government is scheduled to report gross domestic product figures
on Jan. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
