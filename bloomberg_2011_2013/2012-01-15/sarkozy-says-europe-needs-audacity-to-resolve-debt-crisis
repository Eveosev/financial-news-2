French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said European nations and institutions must display “courage
and audacity” in efforts to end the region’s debt crisis.  “More than ever, we need to show courage and audacity,”
Sarkozy told  Spain ’s ABC newspaper, according to a transcript of
an interview provided by his office. “That goes for all the
euro-area member states that have embarked on reform. It goes
equally for European institutions, which more than ever should
move to protect the euro.”  Sarkozy also said markets began to stabilize at the end of
December and he “hopes that the latest developments won’t add
to difficulties.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
