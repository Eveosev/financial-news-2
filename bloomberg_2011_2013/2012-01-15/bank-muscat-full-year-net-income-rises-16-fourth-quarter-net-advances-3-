BankMuscat SAOG (BKMB) , Oman’s biggest bank
by assets, said full-year profit rose 16 percent as higher
income from lending offset provisions for loan losses.  Net income advanced to 117.5 million rials ($305 million)
from 101.6 million rials a year earlier, the bank said in a
 statement  to the  Muscat Securities Market  today. The mean
estimate of 10 analysts on Bloomberg was for a profit of 116.3
million rials. Fourth-quarter profit increased 3 percent to 30.3
million rials, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
subtracting nine-month results from full-year earnings.  Net interest income rose 13 percent to 212.1 million rials
helped by an improvement in net interest margin and an increase
in lending, according to the statement. Charges for credit
losses climbed 23 percent to 56.2 million rials as the bank
boosted general provisions. Net loans increased 20 percent to
4.82 billion rials, while customer deposits grew 32 percent to
4.85 billion.  Bank Muscat’s shares dropped 0.8 percent to 0.763 rials at
10:39 a.m. in Muscat. The shares have declined 15 percent in the
past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
