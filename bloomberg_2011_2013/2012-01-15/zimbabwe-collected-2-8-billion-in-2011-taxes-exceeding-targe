Zimbabwe collected $2.8 billion in
tax in 2011, surpassing a $2.5 billion target, as the economy
strengthened, the government said.  VAT contributed $1.1 billion and individual tax $480
million, Stenford Moyo, chairman of the Zimbabwe Revenue
Authority, said in an e-mailed statement. Company tax brought in
$296.6 million against a target of $270 million.  Zimbabweâ€™s economy will probably grow by 9.4 percent in
2012, Finance Minister  Tendai Biti  said in his budget
presentation last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
