The  European Central Bank  has
stretched its mandate to the extreme due to its bond-purchase
program, the bankâ€™s former chief economist  Juergen Stark  wrote

the document.  It is an illusion to think that monetary policy can remedy
major structural and fiscal problems in the euro area, the
magazine cited Stark as writing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
