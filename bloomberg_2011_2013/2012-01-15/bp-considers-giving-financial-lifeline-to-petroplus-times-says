BP Plc (BP/)  is considering throwing a
financial lifeline to Petroplus Holdings AG, the Swiss refiner
fighting to avoid bankruptcy, the Sunday Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  “BP is one of a number of companies that takes supply from
the Coryton refinery at the mouth of the Thames, which is a
Petroplus refinery, and we’re monitoring the situation very
carefully,” David Nicholas, a London-based spokesman at BP,
told Bloomberg News by phone today. He declined to comment on
the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
