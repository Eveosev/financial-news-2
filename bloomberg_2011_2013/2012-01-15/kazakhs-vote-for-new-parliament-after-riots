Kazakh President  Nursultan
Nazarbayev ’s Nur Otan party received 81.3 percent of the vote in
yesterday’s parliamentary election, an exit poll showed.  Two more parties, Akzhol and the Communists, surpassed the
7 percent limit to win seats in the Majilis, the lower house
of parliament, Gulmira Ileulova, head of the Strategy Center for
Social and Political Research, told reporters in the capital
Astana, citing the poll.  Akzhol received 7.2 percent and the Communists 7.1 percent,
Ileulova said. The opposition National Social Democratic party
got 1.5 percent of the vote. The survey of 19,520 Kazakhs didn’t
give a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
