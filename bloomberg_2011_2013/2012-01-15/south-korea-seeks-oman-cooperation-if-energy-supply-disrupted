South Korean Prime Minister Kim Hwang Sik asked Oman to cooperate in supplying energy products
should there be an emergency need for oil, following Iranian
threats to close the  Strait of Hormuz .  Oman’s Sultan Qaboos and Deputy Prime Minister Fahd al-Said
promised “full support” without elaborating, Kim told
Bloomberg News.  “The Korean government has been prepared in case such
situation happens and we are ready to cooperate with many
countries around the world,” Kim said. “There has been
discussion about the issue of closing the Hormuz sea route and
we agreed that it is not beneficial to anyone if the sea route
is closed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
