Warba Bank, an Islamic lender based
in  Kuwait , plans to start retail operations in the first
quarter.  The  Kuwait Investment Authority , the country’s sovereign
wealth fund, holds 24 percent of the bank, while the government
distributed the rest “equally allocated among all Kuwaiti
nationals,” the company said in e-mailed statement today.  Warba Bank was established in 2009 with a capital of 100
million dinars ($358 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
