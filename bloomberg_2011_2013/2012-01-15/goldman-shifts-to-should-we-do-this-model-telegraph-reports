Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is moving
to a “should we do this” model of banking from a creed of
“can we do this,” President and Chief Operating Officer  Gary Cohn  said in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph.  “We were the best firm in the world at analyzing ‘can we
do something,’” Cohn said in the interview. “We didn’t have as
many checkpoints on ‘should we do something.’”  “My whole world now is ‘should we do something,’” said
Cohn, according to the newspaper. “Those are very difficult
issues.”  Goldman Sachs has declined to sell some high-risk products
to clients even though they’re legal and the bank has turned
away business that may be connected to sanctioned countries such
as Iran and  Sudan , the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Cohn said the banking industry faces “real consolidation”
and that Goldman Sachs will maintain its market share because
competitors are leaving the business, the Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
