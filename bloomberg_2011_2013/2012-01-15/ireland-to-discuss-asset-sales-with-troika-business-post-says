Ireland’s negotiations with the
troika this week will focus on the potential sale of Bord Gais
Energy, Coillte and the Dublin Port Authority, the Sunday
Business Post reported, citing unidentified people.  The troika, consisting of the  International Monetary Fund ,
 European Central Bank  and European Union, wants the government
to raise 5 billion euros ($6.3 billion) to service its debt
burden, the newspaper said. No deal has yet been made on the
sale of ESB, Ireland’s state-owned power company, it reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
