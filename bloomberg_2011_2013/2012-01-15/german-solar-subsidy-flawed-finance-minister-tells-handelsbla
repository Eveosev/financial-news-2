(Corrects Roesler’s title in first paragraph of story
originally published on Jan. 15.)  Germany ’s subsidies for solar energy
installations are economically unsustainable and need changing,
Economy Minister Philipp Roesler was cited by  Handelsblatt  as
saying in an article to be published tomorrow.  There is a “glaring disparity” between the level of
support photovoltaics receive and the amount of power they
contribute, he said, calling for a fundamental reform of
Germany’s renewable energy law, according to Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
