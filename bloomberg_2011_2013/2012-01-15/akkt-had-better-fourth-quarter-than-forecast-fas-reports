Takkt AG (TTK)  had a better fourth quarter
than forecast as companies used healthy balance sheets to
improve their facilities, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung
reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Felix Zimmermann.  The office-equipment retailer will exceed targets of 6
percent revenue growth and a profit margin of 14 percent and may
therefore pay a special dividend in May, FAS cited Zimmermann as
saying.  The company has a 100 million-euro ($127 million)  credit
line  that it intends to use for takeovers, Zimmermann told FAS.
Completing purchases may take some time as many of the targets
are family-owned businesses, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
