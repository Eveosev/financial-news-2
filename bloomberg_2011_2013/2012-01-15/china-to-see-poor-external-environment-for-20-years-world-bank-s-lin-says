China  will have a relatively poor
external environment for its development in the next 20 years,
Justin Lin, the World Bank’s chief economist, said in Beijing.  Euro-area economies, the U.S. and  Japan  will remain
“sluggish” in the next 5 to 10 years and their fiscal deficits
will continue to build up in the next decade or even longer, he
said at a forum.  These economies are likely to adopt loose monetary policies
to tackle their problems and some of the funds will flow to
other countries including China, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
