Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G)  and  RSA
Insurance group Plc (RSA)  are among a dozen insurers involved in the
coverage of the Costa Concordia cruise ship that ran aground
after hitting rocks off the Italian coast on Jan. 13, il Sole 24
Ore reported, without saying where it got the information.  Aon Corp. (AON) ,  Carnival Corp (CCL) ’s insurance broker, may have to
arrange payment for the total loss of 450 million euros if damages
exceed the insured amount of the ship, Sole said. Costa Concordia’s
protection and indemnity insurance for damages to passengers and
crew should cover as much as $3 billion, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
