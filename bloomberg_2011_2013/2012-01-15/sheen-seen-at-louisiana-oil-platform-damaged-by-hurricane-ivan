A sheen was reported near a
production platform operated by Taylor Energy Co. in  Louisiana 
that was damaged by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, according to a
filing with National Response Center.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
Bloomberg News couldnâ€™t immediately verify that the information
in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
