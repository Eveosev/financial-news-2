Israel ’s benchmark bonds fell for
the first time in five days before an inflation report today and
a government debt auction tomorrow.  The yield on the 5.5 Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2022
increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.48
percent, at the close of Tel Aviv trading. Inflation probably
declined to an annual  rate  of 2.4 percent in December from 2.6
percent the prior month, according to the median estimate of 12
economists compiled by Bloomberg. Prices probably rose 0.2
percent in the month after declining 0.1 percent in November,
according to the survey. The data is scheduled to be released at
6:30 p.m. local time.  “Investors were sitting on the fence at the end of the
trading day ahead of the inflation data coming out later and
ahead of the bond auction tomorrow,” Sagie Poznerson, head of
trading at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by
telephone. “Some investors were selling today to buy at better
prices at the auction tomorrow.”  The  Finance Ministry  is planning to sell 1.5 billion
shekels ($390 million) of debt tomorrow, including 300 million
shekels of the benchmark bonds due 2022 and 200 million shekels
of the 5.5 percent bonds due 2042.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bond and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, fell seven basis points to 195. That implies
an average annual inflation rate of 1.95 percent. The yield on
the CPI-linked bonds due June 2013 was little changed at 0.45
percent. The rate has dropped 35 basis points this year.  Fund Flows  Israeli funds raised a net 349 million shekels from
investors in the week ended Jan. 12, Meitav Investment House
Ltd. said today. Corporate-bond funds drew investments for the
first week since October, pulling in 34 million shekels, while
government bond funds raised 226 million shekels and stock funds
drew investments of 32 million shekels, according to Tel Aviv-
based Meitav.  The  Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index , a measure of inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, fell for the first time in seven
days, dropping 0.2 percent. Israel Electric Corp. said its board
approved a bond sale of as much as $500 million to institutional
investors, according to a Jan. 12 filing.  The shekel, which weakened 7.5 percent in the past 12
months, lost 0.4 percent to 3.8473 a dollar on Jan. 13. Two-year
 interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for
rates over the period, rose two basis points to 2.50 percent on
Jan. 13. The central bank last month held the benchmark  interest
rate  at 2.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
