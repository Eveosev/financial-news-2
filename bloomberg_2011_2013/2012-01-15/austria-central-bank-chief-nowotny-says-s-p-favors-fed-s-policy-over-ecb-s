European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said  Standard & Poor’s  downgrades
of euro members was based on the ratings company’s favoring the
 Federal Reserve ’s policy of buying  government bonds  over the
ECB’s “restrictive” policy.  S&P has “general doubts regarding our strategy of
combining consolidation measures with the very restrictive
policy of the ECB,” Nowotny said in a panel discussion
broadcast live on Austrian state television yesterday. “Their
model is the American or the English one, where the central bank
itself massively buys bonds,” he said, adding that “this is a
fundamental political discussion, which one has to lead.”  The rating company on Jan. 13 lowered the top ratings of
France and Austria one level to AA+, with “negative” outlooks,
while affirming the ratings of countries that included Germany,
Belgium and the Netherlands. The company also downgraded Italy,
Portugal, Spain and Cyprus by two steps and cut Malta, Slovakia
and Slovenia by one level.  S&P analysts, outlining the decision to downgrade the
sovereign credit ratings of nine of the euro area’s 17 members,
said the challenges posed by the crisis were rising.  “The explanation of S&P is fundamentally a political one
-- they are unhappy with the developments in  Europe ,” said
Nowotny, who also heads  Austria ’s central bank. “Frankly there
are a lot of reasons to be unhappy, things are going too
slowly.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
