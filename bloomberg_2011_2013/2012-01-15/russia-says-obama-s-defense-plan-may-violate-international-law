The $662 billion U.S. defense
spending plan for 2012 may violate international law, the
Russian Foreign Ministry said on its  website .  The bill strengthens the application of U.S criminal and
anti-terrorism legislation in respect of non-American citizens,
the ministry said. It also violates U.S obligations under
international law, including the Geneva Convention on the
protection of civilians and the 1966 Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, it said.  President  Barack Obama  signed the bill into law Dec. 31. It
includes sanctions requiring suspected members of al-Qaeda to be
kept in military custody.  To contact the reporter on this story:
