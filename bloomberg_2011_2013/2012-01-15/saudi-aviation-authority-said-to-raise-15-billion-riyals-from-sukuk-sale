Saudi Arabia ’s General Authority of
Civil Aviation raised 15 billion riyals ($4 billion) from the
sale of Islamic bonds, said a banker familiar with the
transaction.  The 10-year notes will pay a profit rate of 2.5 percent,
said the banker, who declined to be identified because the
details are private. The authority plans to use funds from the
sale to build a 27 billion-riyal ($7.2 billion) airport in
Jeddah. HSBC Holdings Plc’s unit in Saudi Arabia managed the
transaction.  The world’s largest oil exporter, which expects to post a
12 billion-riyal  budget surplus  this year, is undertaking a $384
billion plan to develop housing, education and transportation.
Companies controlled by the government have turned to Islamic
debt, which pays asset returns to comply with the religion’s ban
on interest, to help finance projects.  Saudi Aramco  Total Refining & Petrochemical Co., a joint
venture between state-run Saudi Aramco and  France ’s Total SA
known as Satorp, issued 3.75 billion riyals of Islamic bonds in
2011, the nation’s biggest sukuk sale that year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The issue helped boost borrowings in the six-
nation Gulf Cooperation Council last year by 62 percent to $7.35
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
