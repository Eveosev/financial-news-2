Financial firms and investors in
complex cross-country disputes can turn to a new tribunal in  The
Hague , the latest of six international courts in the
Netherlands.  “National courts and ad hoc arbitration until now haven’t
succeeded in unambiguous, authoritative jurisprudence,” Jeffrey Golden, chairman of the management board for the new Panel of
Recognized International Market Experts in Finance, said in a
statement. The arbitration and mediation service, known as  Prime
Finance , will officially open today.  The credit crunch and the collapse of  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  led to an increase in lawsuits between banks and
other financial institutions. Regulators are concerned that
national courts lack the time and expertise to properly
adjudicate the disputes.  “This court can be used by large financial institutions,
such as banks and large asset managers, and eventually also by
states that have a dispute with financial institutions,”
 Bernard Verbunt , a lawyer at  Simmons & Simmons  in Amsterdam who
specializes in banking and financial services disputes, said by
telephone.  The tribunal, at the Peace Palace in The Hague, can call
upon almost 100 experts to arbitrate or mediate in cases
involving derivatives and structured financial products.  The panel was set up by the  World Legal Forum  following a
meeting of lawyers, financial experts, regulators and central
bank representatives from the U.S.,  Europe , and  Asia  in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
