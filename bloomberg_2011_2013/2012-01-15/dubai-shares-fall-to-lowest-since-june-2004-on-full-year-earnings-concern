Dubai’s  benchmark stock index 
retreated to the lowest level in more than seven years on
concern that full-year earnings may disappoint and after France
and Austria were stripped of top credit ratings.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
tower, fell 2.4 percent.  Emirates Integrated Telecommunications
Co. (DU)  dropped to the lowest level in more than a month. The  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  lost 1 percent to 1,314.47, the lowest since June
2004, at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The  Bloomberg GCC 200
Index  slipped 0.1 percent. In Egypt, the  EGX30 Index (EGX30) , down 49
percent last year, climbed 1.7 percent.  “There’s some concern over earnings and momentum is very
negative at the moment in United Arab Emirates markets,” said
Ahmed Talhaoui, the Abu Dhabi-based head of investment and asset
management at Royal Capital PJSC. “There’s no positive
catalyst, so it’s difficult to see buyers coming into this
environment” as European debt woes worsen sentiment, he said.  Emaar  may report on Feb. 9 report  a 27 percent drop in
full-year earnings to 1.8 billion dirhams ($490 million),
according to the mean estimate of 13 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The company’s  third-quarter profit  fell 34 percent as
revenue declined and property deliveries slowed. Income of
developers in Dubai and  Abu Dhabi  suffered after real-estate
prices tumbled by more than half since their peak in 2008. Emaar
fell to 2.44 dirhams, the lowest since March 7.  Oil Declines  Standard & Poor’s cut  France  and Austria one level to AA+
from AAA last week and said they face the risk of further
reductions. Spain and Italy were also among nine nations
downgraded, while Finland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg kept
their AAA ratings and were put on negative outlook.  Crude oil for February delivery declined 0.4 percent to
$98.70 a barrel in  New York  on Jan. 13, the lowest settlement
since Dec. 21, after two European Union officials said an
embargo on Iranian crude imports may be postponed for six
months. The contracts dropped 2.8 percent last week. Gulf Arab
oil exporters, including the U.A.E. and Qatar, supply about a
fifth of the world’s oil.  Emirates Integrated retreated 1.4 percent to 2.85 dirhams,
the lowest since Dec. 13. The U.A.E. phone company known as Du
may report a  69 percent drop  in fourth-quarter profit to 284
million dirhams, according to the median estimate of three
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  IMF Loan  In North Africa, Egypt’s benchmark index rose to 3,840.05,
the highest since Dec. 15. A delegation from the  International
Monetary Fund  will arrive in Egypt today to resume talks on a
$3.2-billion loan, state-run Al Ahram newspaper reported Jan. 8,
citing Finance Minister Momtaz El-Saieed.  “The market is up amid speculation the talks will lead to
an agreement,” said Wafik Dawood, director of institutional
sales at Cairo-based Mega Investments Securities.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  and Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  dropped
0.7 percent. Oman’s benchmark stock  index  declined 0.8 percent
and Saudi Arabia’s measure was little changed. Bahrain’s  measure 
gained 0.2 percent and Kuwait’s  gauge  rose 0.3 percent.  The  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  dropped 1.9 percent, the most this year, to
1,107.26. The yield on the 5.5 percent government bond due in
January 2022 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
4.48 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
