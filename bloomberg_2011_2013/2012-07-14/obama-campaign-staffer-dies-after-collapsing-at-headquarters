A 29-year-old staffer working for
President  Barack Obama ’s re-election died today after collapsing
at the campaign’s Chicago headquarters, according to a campaign
official.  Alex Okrent had worked for Obama since 2004, according to
the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. During a
campaign tour through Virginia today, Obama called Okrent’s
family and later consoled other campaign staffers on a
conference call, the official said.  The Chicago Sun-Times earlier reported that Okrent had
collapsed at the campaign’s headquarters and was taken to
Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was pronounced dead at the
hospital, the paper said.  Okrent is a native of Evanston, Illinois, and graduated
from Wesleyan University in Connecticut, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
