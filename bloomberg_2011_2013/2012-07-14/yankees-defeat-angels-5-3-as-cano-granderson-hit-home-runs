Robinson Cano and  Curtis Granderson 
hit two-run homers as the Major League Baseball-leading New York
Yankees defeated the Los Angeles Angels 5-3.  Cano’s 21st home run in the bottom of the first inning at
Yankee Stadium tied the game 2-2 and Granderson’s 24th homer in
the third gave New York the lead.  Cano added a run-scoring single in the sixth when he drove
in  Alex Rodriguez .  “I think this team is playing almost about as well as it
can,” manager  Joe Girardi  told reporters yesterday. “Could
some individual numbers be better? Yes, but the contribution
we’re getting from all 25 guys has been really good this year.”  Alberto Callaspo drove in two runs for the Angels in the
first inning and Howard Kendrick scored on Bobby Wilson’s
ground-out to the shortstop in the fourth.  Yankees starter  Freddy Garcia  gave up three runs in five
innings for the win and  Rafael Soriano  pitched a perfect ninth
for his 22nd save.  “That was nice, to give up two in the first and then get
it back,” Garcia told reporters. “The next inning, I was able
to shut it down, and it’s good when that happens. I was able to
go five and give up three. And the bullpen did a great job.”  Angels starter Jerome Williams (6-6) took the loss,
allowing five runs on seven hits in six innings.  New York improved its MLB-best record to 54-33. The Yankees
are eight games ahead of the Baltimore Orioles in the American
League Eastern Division.  To contact the reporters on this story:
