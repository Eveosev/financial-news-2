European Aeronautic, Defence and
Space Co.  is considering setting up a bank for its cash reserve
of about 10 billion euros ($12.2 billion) as protection against
the euro-area debt crisis,  Welt am Sonntag  reported, citing
Airbus SAS Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier.  The euroâ€™s decline against the dollar has a positive side
for Airbus because the plane maker, while based in  Europe , does
most of its business in dollars, the Berlin-based newspaper
citing Bregier as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
