Manchester United is ready to make a
10 million-pound ($16 million) bid for Everton’s  Leighton
Baines , the Times said.  Everton values the 27-year-old defender at 15 million
pounds, the Times said. United manager  Alex Ferguson  would
likely balk at that, but is confident of working out a deal, the
newspaper said.  Baines would be just the second player over the age of 26
that Ferguson signed for a fee in the past 15 years, the Times
said. The Scot prefers buying younger players that he can
develop, according to the Times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
