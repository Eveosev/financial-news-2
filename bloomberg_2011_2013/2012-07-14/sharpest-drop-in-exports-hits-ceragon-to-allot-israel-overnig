global recovery caused the nation’s exports to fall at the
fastest rate this year.  The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the most traded
Israeli companies in New York tumbled 4.6 percent to 78.22 last
week, the largest five-day decline since May 18.  Allot

about 40 percent of its gross domestic product from exports,
posted the widest trade deficit in five months in June as
products sent to other nations dropped 11.9 percent to $3.3
billion, the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of Statistics  said
on its website July 12.  “Investors have been watching the global slowdown
cautiously to see how it would impact Israel,” Chaim Fromowitz,
executive vice president of Bank Leumi USA, said by phone from
New York on July 13. “Now we’ve seen it’s hurting exports and
that’s caused concern for companies exposed to more China
slowdown and Europe issues. The U.S. numbers aren’t good either.
It’s all impacting the mood.”  Deficit  Israel’s  TA-25 (TA-25)  Index lost 0.8 percent today, to close at

exports, excluding diamonds in May, the U.S. 22 percent and Asia
21 percent, according to a June 18  statement . Israeli growth is
expected to slow to 3.1 percent this year, from 4.8 percent in
2011, according to the  Bank of Israel .  Confidence among U.S. consumers dropped to 72 this month
from June’s 73.2 reading, the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan index of consumer sentiment showed on July 13. The
gauge was projected to rise to 73.5, according to the median
forecast of 69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  China GDP  China’s gross domestic product expanded 7.6 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics
said yesterday from Beijing. The pace, a three-year low,

or $38.4 million, of its revenue from Europe in 2011. It

million in same period last year, according to the mean  estimate 
of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Ceragon, the Tel Aviv-based maker of wireless networks,

week to $32.26. Before today, the shares traded at a discount of
$1.66 versus the Tel Aviv stock. They declined 4.3 percent to
128.5 shekels, or $32.48, in Israel today.  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
to  Switzerland ’s, has about 60 companies traded on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, the most of any country outside the U.S. after
