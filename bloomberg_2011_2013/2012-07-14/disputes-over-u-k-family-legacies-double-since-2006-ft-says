The number of High Court cases by
claimants contesting trusts, wills and probates have doubled
since 2006 to 663 last year, the Financial Times newspaper
reported today, citing law firm Hugh James.  Many family estates have been hurt by the financial crisis,
leaving less money for beneficiaries, the report cited Matthew
Evans, partner at Hugh James, as saying. That sometimes prompts
family members to go to court in an attempt to increase their
share of the estate, Evans told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
