Alaska  sued the Obama administration
to block the Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast Guard
from extending the North American Emissions Control Area to the
state.  The regulations, set to be enforced Aug. 1, require marine
cargo carriers and cruise lines to use costly and difficult-to-
obtain low-sulfur fuel, Alaska Attorney General Michael Geraghty
said in an e-mail yesterday. The rules will greatly increase
shipping costs to Alaska and harm the state’s tourism industry,
he said.  The state alleges the decision to include Alaska in the
enforcement zone was based on flawed or incomplete data.  Marianne Holsman, an EPA spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment about the lawsuit
left after regular business hours yesterday.  The case is Alaska v. Clinton, 12-142, U.S. District Court,
District of Alaska (Anchorage).  Editor  To contact the reporter on this story:
