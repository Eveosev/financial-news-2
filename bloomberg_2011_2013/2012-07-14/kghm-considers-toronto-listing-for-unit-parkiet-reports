KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper
producer with the biggest European mine output, may list its
international operations unit on the Toronto stock exchange in a
few years, Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Wirth  said in an
interview with Parkiet.  The unit includes mining projects in Chile and Canada that
Lubin, Poland-based KGHM acquired with its March purchase for
more than 9 billion zloty ($2.63 billion) of Canada’s Quadra FNX
Mining Ltd., the daily cited Wirth as saying. He said the second
quarter was “very good,” declining to elaborate, Parkiet
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
