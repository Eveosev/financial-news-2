Losses in  Banco Cruzeiro do Sul  SA
may amount to 2.5 billion reais ($1.23 billion) as an audit
found irregularities in the bank’s loan portfolio, O Estado de
S.Paulo reported, citing an audit.  Cruzeiro do Sul, which was seized by  Brazil ’s central bank
in June amid “serious financial violations,” didn’t have
proper documentation for 1.6 billion reais in loans and
overestimated some assets by 900 million reais, the newspaper
said, citing the audit report from the central bank, Brazil’s
deposit-insurance fund, known as FGC, and PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP.  The central bank, the FGC, PwC and Cruzeiro do Sul declined
to comment, O Estado said. Cruzeiro do Sul’s press official told
Bloomberg News that she couldn’t immediately comment on the
report; the central bank declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
