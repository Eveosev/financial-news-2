Germany’s Andre Greipel won his
third stage of this year’s Tour de France as Britain’s Bradley Wiggins maintained the race leader’s yellow jersey.  Greipel, of the Lotto-Belisol team, beat Liquigas’s Peter
Sagan in a sprint to the finish of the 217-kilometer (135-mile)
13th-stage ride from Saint-Paul-Trois-Chateaux to Le Cap d’Agde.  “I think we deserve this win because we were working for
it,” Greipel said in an interview with EuroSport.  Team Sky’s Wiggins finished 12th after leading a late
sprint out and keeps his 2-minute, 5-second advantage over
teammate and countryman Christopher Froome. Italy’s Vincenzo Nibali of Liquigas is 18 seconds farther back, followed by BMC
Racing’s  Cadel Evans , the defending champion from  Australia , who
is 3:19 behind Wiggins.  Wiggins led the peleton as it caught leaders Alexandre Vinokourov and Michael Albasini with about 2.5 kilometers
remaining.  Rabobank’s Luis-Leon Sanchez broke away to take the lead
before being overtaken by Wiggins, who moved aside to give
teammate Edvald Boasson Hagen a chance for the victory. Greipel
and Sagan then burst from behind, with the German winning the
sprint across the finish line.  The 20-stage race heads into the Pyrenees Mountains
tomorrow for a 191-kilometer ride from Limoux to Foix featuring
two climbs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
