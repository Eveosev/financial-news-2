U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will hold a meeting next week of the COBRA emergency response
committee to discuss security issues related to the Olympics
Games in  London , the Times reported, without citing anyone.  The July 16 meeting will be the first of several overseen
by Cameron after concerns arose as to whether private guards
could adequately secure the Olympics, the newspaper said.  Officials mobilized 3,500 additional troops this week to
help protect the games. London 2012 committee Chairman Sebastian
Coe wouldn’t rule out the need for more military personnel, the
Times said. The Olympics committee will have to pay the
government for the deployment of additional soldiers, the Times
reported, citing government officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
