French President  Francois Hollande 
called on African countries to organize a military intervention
in Mali.  “In the north of Mali there is organized terrorism” and a
group that “wants to engage in terrorism not only locally but
on the African and possibly European level,” Hollande said
today on national television. “It’s up to the Africans to do
this intervention with the support of the  United Nations .”  Hollande also said that pressure must be maintained on the
Syrian government of Bashar Al-Assad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
