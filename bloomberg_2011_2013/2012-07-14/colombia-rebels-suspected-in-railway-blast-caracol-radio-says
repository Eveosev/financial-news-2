Colombia’s biggest rebel group is
suspected in an explosion at a railway that carries coal for
units of  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP) ,
 Caracol Radio  reported.  About eight meters of track was destroyed today in Guajira
Province at the railroad that serves Cerrejon, the world’s
largest open-pit coal mine for export, Caracol  said  on its
website.  The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, was
suspected of being responsible for the dynamite attack, Caracol
said, citing comments from Elver Velasco, a commander with the
Guajira police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
