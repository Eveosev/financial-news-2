Dutch homeowners who have an
existing mortgage should have to pay down debt to get a tax
rebate, like new buyers will be forced to do starting next year,
newspaper AD reported today, citing an interview with ABN Amro
Group NV Chief Executive Officer Gerrit Zalm.  People who buy a house in coming years shouldnâ€™t be at a
disadvantage, the newspaper cited Zalm as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
