     July 14 (Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co., a unit
of Saudi Basic Industries Corp., posted a 1 percent decline in
second-quarter profit, missing analysts’ estimates.  Net income dropped to 784 million riyals from 790 million
riyals a year earlier, the  company said in a statement  to the
Saudi stock market today. The mean estimate of 10 analysts was
for a profit of 961 million riyals, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The drop was because of “lower of sales volume due to
lower production volumes as a result of turnaround of some
plants,” the Jubail-based company said.  Saudi Arabian Fertilizer, also known as Safco, is the
second unit of Saudi Basic Industries to report a drop in
profit.  Yanbu National Petrochemical Co. (YANSAB)  posted a 33 percent
decline in second-quarter profit last week.  Saudi Basic
Industries (SABIC) , also known as Sabic, is the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker.   To contact the reporter on this story:
