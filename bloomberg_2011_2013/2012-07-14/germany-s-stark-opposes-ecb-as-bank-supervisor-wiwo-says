Former European Central Bank
Executive Board member Juergen Stark said the ECB would risk the
independence of its monetary policy if it became  Europe ’s bank
regulator, Wirtschaftswoche  reported , citing an interview to be
published tomorrow.  The euro area’s central bank would face conflicts of
interest, for instance if a liquidity crisis at a major bank
influenced ECB interest-rate decisions, the magazine quoted
Stark as saying, in a summary of his comments e-mailed by the
magazine today. While Stark backs creating a European banking
regulator, he doesn’t want the ECB to take on the task,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
