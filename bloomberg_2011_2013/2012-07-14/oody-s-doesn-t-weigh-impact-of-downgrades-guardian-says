Moody’s Investors Service’s ratings
are based on financial changes and don’t specifically consider
whether a downgrade will make a country’s situation worse by
prompting investors to sell bonds, the U.K.’s Guardian  reported ,
citing Moody’s European head Frederic Drevon.  Regulators are partly to blame for herd selling after a
downgrade, because ratings have been written into rules
governing what bonds can be held by certain investors, the
newspaper said, citing Drevon. Drevon said he doesn’t think
Moody’s ratings have lost credibility with investors, the
Guardian reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
