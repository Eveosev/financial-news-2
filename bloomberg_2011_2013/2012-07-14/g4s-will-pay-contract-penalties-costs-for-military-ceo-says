G4S Plc (GFS) , the company awarded the
contract to protect London’s Olympic Games, said the “biggest
chunk” of its expected losses after failing to provide enough
staff will be penalty payments to the U.K. government.  In a statement late yesterday, the company said it expects
to lose up to 50 million pounds ($77.9 million) on its contract
after the government said it will deploy 3,500 extra soldiers to
provide security to meet the G4S staffing shortfall.  G4S underestimated the task of supplying staff for the
Olympics, Chief Executive Officer Nick Buckles said today in an
interview with  Sky News .  He said most of the expected losses would comprise
penalties to the government and others expenses, including
military costs.  “We expect to get paid for the part of the contract
fulfilled,” Buckles told Sky. He said G4S had “failed to
deliver” on the task it was given and apologised.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
