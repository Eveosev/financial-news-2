Egypt’s highest appeals court
rebuffed parliament’s request to examine a constitutional court
ruling that dissolved the Islamist-led assembly.  The Court of Cassation unanimously ruled today it has no
jurisdiction over the implementation of last month’s ruling, the
state-run Middle East  News Agency  reported. The verdict had
prompted the military to dissolve parliament and retain
legislative powers before Mohamed Mursi won the country’s
presidential election.  After his election to succeed  Hosni Mubarak , who was ousted
in last year’s uprising, Mursi issued a decree reinstating
parliament. He backed down July 11 after criticism from the
judiciary, saying he would respect the ruling of the
constitutional court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
