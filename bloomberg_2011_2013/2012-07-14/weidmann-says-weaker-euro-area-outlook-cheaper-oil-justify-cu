The worsening of the euro area’s
economic prospects and the decline in  oil prices  justify this
month’s interest-rate cut by the  European Central Bank ,
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, who is also an ECB Governing
Council member, was cited as saying in an interview published
today in Het Financieele Dagblad.  The outcome of the last summit of European leaders left
room for interpretation and was damaging because it gave the
impression the meeting was about only a collective-liability
arrangement for banks, the Amsterdam-based newspaper cited
Weidmann as saying.  Euro-area nations “should discuss giving up sovereignty
with the same openness as the question of how to resolve the
debt problem collectively,” he told the paper.  The involvement of non-European Union organizations in
trying to resolve the  euro-zone  crisis can help because it
brings a neutral party to the table, but it can also be a
concern because they don’t fully grasp the complexity of the
issue, Weidmann said in response to a question about the role of
the  International Monetary Fund , according to the newspaper.  Euro nations should consider further integration with
shared liability, preferably in the form of a fiscal federation,
the newspaper cited him as saying. A eurozone with fewer members
would have “huge financial consequences,” he told the paper.  The restructuring programs for nations that have received
aid are working and results have been achieved in Ireland and
 Portugal  while the divergence of economies within the euro zone
has narrowed, Weidmann was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
