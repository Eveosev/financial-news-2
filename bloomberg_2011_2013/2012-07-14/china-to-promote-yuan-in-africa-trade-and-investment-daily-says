China will promote its currency for
settling trade and investment with Africa, the  China Daily 
 reported  today, citing Li Dongrong, the assistant governor of
the People’s Bank of China.  China’s central bank will encourage the use of the yuan,
also known as the  renminbi , as demand for the currency in Africa
increases and the continent’s economy expands, Li said at a
forum in Beijing yesterday, according to the report. More
African nations will include the yuan in their foreign-reserve
portfolios, the newspaper said, citing unidentified central-bank
governors at the forum.  Bank of Ghana  decided to use the renminbi as part of its
settlement and reserve currency in January, China Daily reported,
citing Millison Narh, the bank’s second deputy governor. The
Bank of Zambia has yet to decide on including the Chinese
currency in its reserves but does expect increased use of it for
trade settlements with China, the article cited Michael Gondwe,
the bank’s governor, as saying.  An economic rebound in Europe or the U.S. would curb use of
the  yuan , as central banks would prefer to hold euros and
dollars as their exchange rates strengthen, Narh said, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
