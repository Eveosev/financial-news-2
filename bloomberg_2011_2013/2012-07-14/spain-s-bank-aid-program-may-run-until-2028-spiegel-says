Europe ’s rescue program for Spanish
banks could run until 2028,  Der Spiegel  said, citing an
unpublished proposal by the European Financial Stability
Facility, the euro area’s temporary rescue fund.  The EFSF plans for as much as 100 billion euros ($122.5
billion) in loans to flow in four installments through next
June, plus the creation in November of a so-called bad bank
capitalized with as much as 25 billion euros that are part of
the total, the German magazine said today in an advance copy of
an article for its next edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
