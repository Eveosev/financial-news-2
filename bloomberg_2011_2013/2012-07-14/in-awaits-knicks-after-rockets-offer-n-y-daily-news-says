Jeremy Lin is waiting for the  New
York  Knicks to decide if they will match the $25.1 million offer
from the  Houston Rockets , the New York Daily News reported.  The Harvard University point guard yesterday signed the
Rockets’ offer sheet that will pay him $25.1 million over three
years in the National Basketball Association, including $14.9
million in the final year, the newspaper reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  The Knicks have three days from the time they receive the
paperwork from the Rockets to match the offer. The Rockets
altered their original deal, which was $28.8 million over four
years with a $9.3 million team option in the final year, the
Daily News said.  Lin became a scoring sensation for the Knicks in February,
when he was moved from the bench to the starting line after
being dumped by the  Golden State Warriors  and the Rockets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
