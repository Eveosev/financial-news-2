Paris Saint-Germain signed Brazilian
national soccer team defender  Thiago Silva  from AC Milan.  Silva, 27, received a five-year contract, PSG said on its
website without disclosing financial terms. He’d spent the past
three seasons with Milan.  Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi said earlier this week he’d
agreed to sell Silva and Zlatan Ibrahimovic to PSG. Nino Raiola,
Ibrahimovic’s agent, told Agence France-Presse the striker has
yet to reach agreement with PSG.  PSG finished second in France’s Ligue 1 last season, three
points behind champion Montpellier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
