Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, may raise gasoline prices for a
second time this year as it seeks to boost revenue to fund its
investment plan, Energy Minister Edison Lobao said in an
interview to cable news channel Globonews.  Lobao didn’t say when the increase may be announced or by
how much prices may rise. Petrobras lifted gasoline prices in
Brazil by 7.8 percent in June, while Brazil removed a tax on
fuel to prevent an increase for consumers. Lobao  said  that such
compensation won’t happen again in the next price increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
