Most Greeks say the main priority of
 Greece ’s new coalition government lead by Antonis Samaras should
be to boost the economy, a poll by Kapa Research SA showed.  Of 1,003 people surveyed between July 11 and July 12, 57
percent said the most important target of the government should
be economic development, according to the poll for the Sunday
edition of  To Vima  newspaper, pre-published today.  Samaras, the leader of the New Democracy party, formed a
coalition government with the socialist Pasok party and
Democratic Left after an election on June 17. The vote followed
an inconclusive May 6 election that underlined concern Greece
might have to abandon the euro.  Some 41 percent of those questioned said reducing
unemployment must be the first goal of the new administration
compared with 35 percent who said the main priority should be to
renegotiate Greece’s international loan agreement and 35 percent
who said they believe keeping Greece in the euro area should be
the first priority, according to the poll.  Almost all of those surveyed, or 97 percent, said there
should be no further wages cuts and no more tax increases, while
68 percent favored state asset sales as a way to avoid further
austerity measures, the poll showed.  The margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
