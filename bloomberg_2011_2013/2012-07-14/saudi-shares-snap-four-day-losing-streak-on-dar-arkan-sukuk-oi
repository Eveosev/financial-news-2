Saudi Arabian shares snapped a four-
day losing streak after  oil prices  gained and  Dar Al Arkan Real
Estate Development Co. (ALARKAN)  said holders of its $1 billion Islamic
bonds will be repaid July 16.  Dar Al Arkan, which plunged 20 percent last week, advanced
the most since March 24.  Mobile Telecommunications Co. Saudi
Arabia (ZAINKSA) , the mobile-phone company known as Zain Saudi, surged 5.2
percent. The benchmark  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 0.6 percent,
the most since July 3, to 6,701.09 at the close in Riyadh.  U.S. stocks rose for the week and oil prices advanced 3.1
percent last week to $87.10 a barrel amid investor speculation
China, the world’s second-largest economy, may take more
measures to stimulate growth. Saudi Arabia is the world’s
biggest exporter of crude oil.  “Globally there is some recovery in oil prices and some of
the sentiment from these international events is reflected in
today’s activity,” said Asim Bukhtiar, a head of research at
Riyad Capital.  Dar Al Arkan surged 9.8 percent to 8.95 riyals. The
company,  Saudi Arabia ’s largest publicly traded property
developer, said it transferred the money to Deutsche Bank AG and
sukuk holders will receive the funds on July 16, according to a
regulatory filing today.  Zain Saudi jumped as much as 8.9 percent to 13.5 riyals
before trimming gains to close at 13.05 riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
