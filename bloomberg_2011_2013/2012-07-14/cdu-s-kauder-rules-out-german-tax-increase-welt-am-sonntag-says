Volker Kauder , the parliamentary
leader of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democrats, said
his party bloc won’t raise German taxes to pay for euro-area
sovereign rescues, Welt am Sonntag  said , citing an interview.  Kauder was reacting to a  proposal  by the Berlin-based DIW
economic institute to boost revenue with a levy on individual
personal wealth of more than 250,000 euros ($306,000), including
the possibility of forcing taxpayers to buy German government
bonds, the newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
