Europe ’s highest-rated government
bonds rose this week, pushing German two-year note yields down
to a record minus 0.052 percent, as investors sought havens from
the euro-area’s financial turmoil.  Austrian, French, Belgian and Finnish two-year yields fell
to all-time lows this week and those on similar-maturity Dutch
debt dropped below zero for the first time. The  European Central
Bank  said  overnight deposits  from financial firms slid to the
lowest since December as it ended paying interest on excess cash
after cutting  interest rates . Italian notes rose this week even
after Moody’s Investors Service cut the nation’s credit rating.  “With no credible end in sight to the euro-zone debt
crisis, bund yields continue to trend lower with the short-end
trading in negative territory,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at
Investec Bank Plc in London. “Despite remaining largely risk
averse, investors who need to pick up yield are increasing
exposure to the semi-core sovereigns that have maintained their
high ratings.”  Germany ’s  two-year yield  fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, this week to minus 0.042 percent at 5 p.m.
London time yesterday. The zero percent note maturing in June
2014 gained 0.06, or 60 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,223) face
amount, to 100.08.  The  five-year  yield declined three basis points this week
to 0.31 percent after dropping to a record 0.285 percent.  ECB Deposits  Banks in the 17-nation euro region deposited 324.9 billion
euros at the ECB on July 11, down from 808.5 billion euros the
previous day, the Frankfurt-based central bank said. That’s the
least since Dec. 21. Policy makers reduced the  main refinancing
rate  to a record 0.75 percent on July 5 and cut the deposit rate
to zero to encourage financial companies to lend to other
institutions, companies and households.  The yield on  Austrian two-year  notes dropped to a record-
low 0.019 percent yesterday, while the Dutch two-year rate fell
to minus 0.008 percent. Similar-maturity Belgian yields dropped
as low as 0.265 percent, French yields reached 0.10 percent and
Finnish rates fell to 0.008 percent.  Italian two-year notes advanced this week even as Moody’s
cut the nation’s credit rating by two steps to Baa2 and
reiterated its negative outlook. The yield declined 24 basis
points to 3.62 percent.  Germany is scheduled to sell 5 billion euros of two-year
notes on July 18.  Spain  will auction securities due between 2014
and 2019 on July 19, and France plans to sell debt maturing
between 2015 and 2017 the same day.  German bonds have returned 4 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts. Italian securities gained 8.4 percent, and
Spanish bonds lost 4.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
