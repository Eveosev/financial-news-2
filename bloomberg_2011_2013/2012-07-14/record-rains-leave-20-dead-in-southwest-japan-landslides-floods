Record rains in southwestern  Japan 
triggered landslides and flooding that killed at least 22 people,
forced almost a quarter of a million to evacuate and disrupted
transportation on the southern main island of Kyushu.  A record 50.75 centimeters (20 inches) of rain fell in 24
hours in Aso city, central Kyushu, and some parts of the
island’s north may see more than 8 centimeters of rain per hour
today, the  Japan Meteorological Agency   said .  Five local railway lines on the island are stopped, while
the high-speed mainline service resumed operation at 1:31 p.m.,
according to the  website  of Kyushu Railway Co.  Rivers in the region including the Yamakuni flooded, and
people living nearby are advised to evacuate, public broadcaster
NHK reported. At least 246,000 people in Kyushu have been
ordered to evacuate, according to NHK.  Twenty-two people have been confirmed dead and eight are
missing in northern Kyushu, Yomiuri news reported.  Oita Governor Katsusada Hirose requested assistance from
Japan’s Ground Self-Defense Forces after the Kagetsu river
flooded in Hita city, Kyodo news said.  Residents should move to the second floor of their homes or
evacuate to shelters, according to an advisory on Hita’s
municipal  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
