The Spanish government plans to
split the country’s train operator Renfe into four companies
before July 2013, when it plans to liberalize railway passenger
traffic,  Cinco Dias  reported today.  The new firms will be specialized in passenger traffic,
freight, maintenance and rolling materials, the newspaper said,
citing Renfe President Julio Gomez-Pomar and Carmen Librero, the
Ministry of Development’s secretary general for transport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
