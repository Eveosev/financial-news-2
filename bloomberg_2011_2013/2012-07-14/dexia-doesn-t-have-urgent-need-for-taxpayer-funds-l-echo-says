Dexia SA (DEXB)  doesn’t have an urgent need
for additional taxpayer funds because its statutory equity still
exceeded 50 percent of the share capital at the end of June
under Belgian accounting rules,  L’Echo  reported, citing a person
familiar with the matter.  A decision about additional funds for either Dexia or its
French subsidiary Dexia Credit Local SA may have to be taken
before the end of this year, the newspaper said, citing a
Belgian government official it didn’t name. The annual cost of
the fees Dexia has to pay for government backstops on its
borrowings will reach almost 800 million euros ($980 million),
eroding  shareholders’ equity , according to L’Echo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
