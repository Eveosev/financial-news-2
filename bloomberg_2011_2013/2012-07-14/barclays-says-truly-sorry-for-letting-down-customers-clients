Barclays Plc (BARC)  has made a public
apology to customers and clients, saying they have “been let
down” by the bank.  “We are truly sorry for what has happened,” Barclays said
in a advertisement published in several British newspaper today,
including the Financial Times, the London-based Times and the
Guardian.  “You are the lifeblood of our business, and we will not
allow ourselves to be distracted from what really matters --
delivering for you, day in and day out,” the statement, signed
by Chairman Marcus Agius, says. “I also thank you for your
business. It is our responsibility to earn the right to retain
it.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
