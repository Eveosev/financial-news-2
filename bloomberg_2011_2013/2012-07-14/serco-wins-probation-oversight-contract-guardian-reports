Serco Group Plc (SRP)  has been awarded a
37 million-pound ($57.6 million) contract by the U.K. government
to supervise unpaid work done by individuals on probation, the
Guardian  reported .  The four-year contract, which involves supervising 15,000
offenders doing 1.3 million hours of labor, is the first in
which a private company will oversee individuals on probation,
the Guardian said. The Ministry of Justice, which announced
yesterday that Serco had won the contract in partnership with
London Probation Trust, said it will save the government 25
million pounds, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
