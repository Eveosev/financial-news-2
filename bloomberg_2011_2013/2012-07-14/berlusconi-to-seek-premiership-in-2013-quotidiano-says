Former Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  will lead his People of Liberty party into the next
elections,  Quotidiano Nazionale  reported, citing an interview.  Recent opinion polls showing the party struggling prompted
Berlusconi to run again in the vote due by April 2013, the
newspaper cited him as saying.  While the former premier would have rather made the
announcement later in the year, the Italian media pre-empted him
by reporting on his plans, Berlusconi was cited as saying in the
interview.  Berlusconi, 75, will probably lead his party into the
elections,  Angelino Alfano , the partyâ€™s Secretary General, said
July 11 after the daily Corriere della Sera reported that the
tycoon-turned-politician was willing to seek the top job again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
