Klaus Regling, who heads the euro
area’s bailout funds in the debt crisis, said governments could
avoid liability for bank rescues under proposals for a regional
bank supervisor, Welt am Sonntag reported, citing an interview.  If the  European Central Bank  is cleared to act as a bank
regulator in the euro area, banks can receive rescue loans
without going through governments, meaning states wouldn’t be on
the hook for the credits, the Berlin-based newspaper quoted
Regling as saying.  That contradicts German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , who said on July 9 that he expects governments to
guarantee rescue loans even if they go directly to banks, Welt
am Sonntag said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
