Azoty Tarnow (ATT) ,  Poland ’s biggest
chemical maker, gained approval from investors to increase its
share capital by 75 percent to buy state-controlled competitor
 Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy SA (ZAP) , PAP agency reported today.  Azoty owners backed management’s plans to issue stock with
a nominal value of 240.4 million zloty ($70.4 million), PAP
said, citing the result of a shareholders meeting in Tarnow,
southern Poland. The issue will be offered to shareholders of
Pulawy at a ratio of 2.5 Azoty shares for one Pulawy share, PAP
said.  Azoty announced a bid yesterday to buy 32 percent of Pulawy
at 110 zlotys a share, after a separate offer for the same
company by Poland’s  Synthos (SNS)  SA at 102.5 zlotys. Azoty sees 100
million zloty in synergies and investment savings of 200 million
zloty from the Pulawy merger, according to a presentation for
shareholders before the vote today, PAP said.  Poland’s government, which holds a 32 percent stake in
Azoty, supports the Pulawy purchase to consolidate the industry,
it said in a statement yesterday. The treasury opposes a bid by
Russia’s  OAO Acron (AKRN)  to buy Azoty. Acron’s offer ends on July 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
