The European Union has opened an in-depth investigation into state aid it says  France ’s Numericable
SAS received between 2003 and 2006 as part of a transfer of
public cable infrastructure by several French municipalities.  “As Numericable received the infrastructure for free, the
transfers gave the company a huge economic advantage over its
competitors and therefore constitute state aid,” the European
Commission said in an e-mailed statement today. “At this stage,
the commission has doubts that such aid could be found
compatible with EU rules.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
