PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the second-largest U.S. regional bank, said second-quarter
profit more than doubled, beating analysts’ estimates, as fee
revenue surged and the firm set aside less for bad loans.  Net income climbed to $1.12 billion, or $1.99 a share, from
$546 million, or 98 cents, a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-based
bank said today in a statement. The  average estimate  of 31
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings $1.63 a share.  PNC, led by Chief Executive Officer Bill Demchak since
April, has focused on boosting fee revenue by adding clients in
its asset-management business and providing more services to
customers acquired through last year’s acquisition of RBC Bank
USA.  “PNC’s second-quarter results reflect the progress we’re
making in the execution of our strategic priorities,” Demchak,
50, said in the statement.  PNC fell 0.8 percent to $74.50 yesterday in New York. The
shares have gained 28 percent this year, outpacing the 25
percent  advance  of the 24-company  KBW Bank Index. (BKX)   JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank, said last week
that second-quarter net income jumped 31 percent to $6.5 billion
as revenue from trading and investment banking outweighed a drop
in consumer and community banking. Profit at Wells Fargo & Co.,
the largest U.S. home lender, rose 19 percent to $5.52 billion
as the San Francisco-based bank trimmed expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
