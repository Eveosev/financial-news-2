SLM Corp. (SLM) , the student lender known
as Sallie Mae, reported a second-quarter profit of $543 million
as private education delinquencies fell.  Net income rose to $1.20 per share for the three months
ended June 30, compared with $292 million, or 59 cents, in the
year-earlier period, the Newark, Delaware-based company said
today in a statement distributed by Business Wire. Excluding
items such as the market gains and losses of derivatives
contracts, SLM’s core earnings were $462 million, or $1.02 a
share, the company said. That compared with an average estimate
of $1 a share by seven  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sallie Mae is remaking its  business  after legislation
passed in 2010 cut companies out of the market for government-guaranteed debt. The lender is splitting into two firms,
separating its education loan arm from its consumer lending
unit.  Both companies will initially be owned by existing
shareholders, according to a May 29 regulatory filing. Assets
under the so-called education loan management business will
consist of about $118.1 billion in debt under the government’s
Federal Family Education Loan Program, $31.6 billion in private
education loans and $7.9 billion of other holdings.  The consumer banking business, to be called Sallie Mae
Bank, is projected to have about $9.9 billion of total assets,
including private education loans and related origination and
servicing platforms, according to the filing.  Late Payments  Sallie Mae made $368 million in private education loans in
the second quarter, a 15 percent increase from the year-ago
period, according to the statement.  The charge-off rate, or the percentage of loans that have
been written off, was 2.7 percent, down from 3.1 percent a year
ago, the company said. The proportion of payments more than 90
days late fell to 3.6 percent from 4.5 percent during the same
period of 2012.  The delinquency rates are down even as student loans
balloon. U.S. education debt grew by $20 billion to $986 billion
during the first quarter of 2013, according to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. The segment was the fastest growing in
household  borrowing , outpacing an $11 billion increase in auto
debt, the New York Fed said in a May  report . Credit card
balances fell by $19 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
