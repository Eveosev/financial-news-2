While most employees use their own
mobile devices for work, only 30 percent completely trust their
employers to protect personal information and not use it against
them, according to a survey.  Among 3,000 workers in the U.S., U.K. and  Germany , 80
percent said they used their own devices, according to the
research commissioned by mobile-device management company
MobileIron Inc. and carried out by Vision Critical.  “The trust gap is real,” Ojas Rege, MobileIron’s vice
president of strategy, said in a phone interview. “Security and
information technology policies need to be adjusted to a new
mindset.”  Workers in the U.K. trusted their employers the most, with
34 percent saying personal information would be completely safe.
That compared with 31 percent in the U.S. and 24 percent in
Germany.  “Employees want their companies to be transparent and
transparency brings trust,” Rege said.  To reduce concerns, companies need to establish clear
policies and explain them to employees, including details of how
data may be monitored and how such information will be used,
 Mountain View , California-based MobileIron said.  Workers were most worried about employers seeing personal
communications, such as e-mail and texts, MobileIron said in a
statement. “Surprisingly, less than half flagged location as a
concern,” MobileIron said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
