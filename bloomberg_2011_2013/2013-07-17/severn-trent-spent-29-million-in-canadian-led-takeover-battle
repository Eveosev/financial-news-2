Severn Trent Plc (SVT) , the U.K. water
company that spurned a 5.3 billion-pound ($8 billion) offer from
a Canadian-led infrastructure group, said today that it incurred
19 million pounds in costs over the takeover approach.  LongRiver Partners, the group comprising Borealis
Infrastructure Management Inc., a Kuwaiti sovereign wealth fund
and Britain’s Universities Superannuation Scheme, walked away
from its offer last month after two attempts starting May 14 to
sweeten the bid were rejected as too low by Severn Trent.  The Coventry-based water company, Britain’s second-biggest
by market value, supplies drinking water to 7.7 million people
and sewer services to 8.7 million in the Midlands and Wales. It
said in a trading update that advisory, legal and related costs
“addressing this approach” totalled 19 million pounds.  Since the close of trading on May 13 before the takeover
approach to today, Severn Trent shares have fallen 4.2 percent
to 1,749 pence compared with a 1.5 percent decline by the FTSE
100 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
