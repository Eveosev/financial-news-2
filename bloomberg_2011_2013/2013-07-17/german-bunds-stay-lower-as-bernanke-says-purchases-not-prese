 German 10-year bonds stayed lower
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central
bank’s asset purchases “are by no means on a preset course” and
could be reduced more quickly or expanded.  The  bund  yield was three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, higher at 1.58 percent at 1:31 p.m. London time after
dropping to 1.54 percent on July 12, the lowest since June 19.
Two-year yields rose one basis point to 0.1 percent.  “If the outlook for employment were to become relatively
less favorable, if inflation did not appear to be moving back
toward 2 percent, or if financial conditions -- which have
tightened recently -- were judged to be insufficiently
accommodative to allow us to attain our mandated objectives, the
current pace of purchases could be maintained for longer,” the
59-year-old Fed chairman said today in prepared testimony before
the House Financial Services Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
