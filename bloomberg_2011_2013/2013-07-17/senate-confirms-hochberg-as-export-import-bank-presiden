The Senate confirmed  Fred Hochberg 
for a second term as president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank.  The 82-17 approval of Hochberg, 61, is a result of this
week’s agreement between Republicans and Democrats to consider
confirmation of several of President Barack Obama’s executive
appointments while avoiding a change in the Senate’s rules.  The chamber also plans this week to vote on the nominations
of  Thomas Perez  for labor secretary and Gina McCarthy to lead
the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Export-Import Bank provides assistance to purchases of
U.S. products by foreign entities. Congress last year raised its
lending limit to $140 billion through September 2014.  The Senate yesterday confirmed, on a 66-34 vote,  Richard Cordray  as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Cordray was nominated twice and waited more than 700 days
for a confirmation vote. Obama installed him in the director
post in January 2012 using a so-called recess appointment, which
bypasses Senate confirmation.  In exchange for proceeding with Cordray’s confirmation,
Obama agreed to nominate two new candidates to the  National
Labor Relations Board  to replace two he had installed as recess
appointments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
