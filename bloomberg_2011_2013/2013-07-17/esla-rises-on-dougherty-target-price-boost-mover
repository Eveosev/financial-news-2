Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  rose the most in
seven weeks after a Dougherty & Co. analyst more than doubled
her price target for the electric-car maker, a day after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said the shares may fall.  Tesla gained 10 percent to $120.25 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day increase since May 28. The Palo Alto,
California-based company’s shares have more than tripled this
year, compared with an 18 percent climb for the Russell 1000
Index.  Andrea James, an analyst for Dougherty & Co., raised her
price target for Tesla to $200 from $90 in a report today.
Goldman Sachs yesterday said the shares could decline to $84 and
$113 under a best-case scenario. That spurred a 14 percent drop.
Goldman Sachs also cut its auto sector rating to neutral.  “We ultimately believe Tesla is a $300 stock at the
factory’s maximum capacity, which we hair cut to $200 for the
execution risk,” James wrote. “We believe that Tesla is the
only firm that has figured out how to make” electric vehicle
technology “work.”  The company reported a first-quarter profit this year, its
first, on rising sales of its $69,900 Model S sedan. Tesla is
scheduled to release a sport-utility vehicle in 2014 and plans
to introduce a compact SUV and smaller sedan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
