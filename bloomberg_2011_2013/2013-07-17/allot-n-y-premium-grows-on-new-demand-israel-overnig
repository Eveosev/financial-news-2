Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) , the
Israeli maker of devices to track mobile traffic, rallied to a
five-month high in New York on speculation demand will rise as
wireless operators expand LTE networks.  The shares jumped 5.5 percent to $15.05, 2.5 percent above
the  Tel Aviv  stock for the widest premium on the Bloomberg
Israel-US Equity Index of Israeli companies traded in New York.
The gauge added 0.8 percent to the highest in almost two years,
as  Prolor Biotech Inc. (PBTH)  climbed the most in six weeks.  Allot has surged 32 percent since June 24, the day before
it announced orders from three of the world’s top 10
telecommunication operators, exceeding the gains for all seven
members of the Russell 2000 Telecommunications Equipment Index.
Global spending on so-called long-term evolution technology will
reach $24.3 billion in 2013, almost triple the $8.7 billion
estimated for 2012, according to the most recent forecast from
IHS iSuppli, a market research firm in Englewood,  Colorado .  “Customers are coming back to Allot now that they’ve
started to upgrade to LTE,” Matthew Robison, an analyst at
Wunderlich Securities Inc. in  San Francisco  who  upgraded  Allot
to buy on June 26, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “It
looks like they’re back in a positive order cycle.”  The Bloomberg Israel-US gauge advanced to 95.14, extending
this year’s gain to 10 percent. The TA-25 Index slipped 0.1
percent to 1,222.84 at 10:06 a.m. in Tel Aviv.  Allot, based in Hod Hasharon,  Israel , rallied this morning
for a sixth day in Tel Aviv to the highest price since March 14.
The stock climbed 2.7 percent to 53.94 shekels, or $15.  Exchange CEO  Prolor, an Israeli biotechnology company, rose 2.9 percent
to $6.75 in  New York . The Nes Ziona, Israel-based company’s Tel
Aviv-traded shares advanced this morning for a fourth day,
increasing 1.3 percent to 24.1 shekels, or $6.70.  Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange Chief Executive Officer Ester Levanon said yesterday that she will step down at the end of the
year, a decision that follows a drop in trading volume and the
bourse’s failed bid to join MSCI Inc.’s Europe Index.  Levanon, who oversaw the exchange’s shift to developed-market status, didn’t disclose the reason for her resignation in
an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
