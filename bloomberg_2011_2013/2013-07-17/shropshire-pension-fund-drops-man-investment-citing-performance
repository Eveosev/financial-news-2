The  Shropshire County Pension Fund ,
a 1.3 billion-pound ($2 billion) British local-government
 pension plan , pulled an investment with  Man Group Plc (EMG) , citing
the hedge fund’s fees and poor performance.  The fund terminated an investment with Man Group’s FRM
Holdings Ltd. and will next month invest 63 million pounds in
Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP’s multi-strategy fund, Justin
Bridges, Shropshire’s head of treasury and pensions, said by
telephone from Shrewsbury, England. The fund invests in other
pools overseen by Brevan Howard.  “We want to pay a reduced level of fees,” Bridges said.
The pension plan was also disappointed in the FRM fund’s “poor
performance,” he said, declining to disclose the fund’s
returns, citing confidentiality agreements.  FRM’s Absolute Return Strategies Fund invests in  hedge
funds  run by other managers and charges clients an additional
layer of fees to the 2 percent management fees and 20 percent of
profits they charge. London-based Man said in May that clients
withdrew a net $3.7 billion from its range of hedge funds in the
first quarter, the seventh consecutive quarterly outflow.  Shropshire invests 125 million pounds, or 10 percent of its
total assets, in hedge funds, now split evenly between the new
 Brevan Howard  fund and a fund-of-hedge-funds run by  BlackRock
Inc.. (BLK)  The pension plan will keep that investment, Bridges said.  Spokesmen for Man Group and Brevan Howard declined to
comment on Shropshire’s decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
