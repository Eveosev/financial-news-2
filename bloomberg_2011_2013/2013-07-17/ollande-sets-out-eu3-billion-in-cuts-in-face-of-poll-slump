President  Francois Hollande ’s
government will today set out 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in
spending cuts and close tax loopholes as he struggles to revive
a  stalled economy  and his own slumping popularity.  The savings are part of Hollande’s MAP program to modernize
government services and range from trimming consular services to
eliminating special low-tax rates on  diesel fuel  for farmers and
fisherman, according to a presentation to journalists by
officials yesterday.  For Hollande, cutting state spending is a priority as he
seeks to reduce France’s  budget deficit  after he and his
predecessor  Nicolas Sarkozy  increased taxes by 70 billion euros
over three years, helping to choke off growth in  Europe ’s
second-largest economy. Business leaders including Total Chief
Executive Christophe de Margerie this month urged the government
to shrink itself to give businesses room to grow.  “I’ll only increase taxes if it’s unavoidable,” Hollande
said July 14 of next year’s budget. “Ideally, increases will be
as little as possible.”  Hollande has promised France’s European partners that his
government will reduce its deficit to less than 3 percent of
gross domestic product by 2015 under the region’s budget pact.  For Hollande, the attempted shrinking of  government
spending  comes at a time when his popularity is at a record low.  About 31 percent of voters have a “good opinion” of the
Socialist president, down from 61 percent just after his
election a year ago and from 35 percent in May, according to a
BVA poll published June 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
