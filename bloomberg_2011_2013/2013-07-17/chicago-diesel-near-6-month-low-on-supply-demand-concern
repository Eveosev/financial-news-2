Chicago  diesel fuel hovered near the
biggest discount to futures in almost six months as  supplies
soared  and Midwest refiners sold product on lower demand.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel in Chicago gained 0.5 cent to
8 cents a gallon below futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 4:16 p.m., after touching 9 cents, the largest
discount since Jan. 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The differential widened after a government report showed
distillate stockpiles gained  1.25 million  barrels to 29.3
million in the week ended July 12, the highest seasonal level
since 2010, according to Energy Information Administration data.
Stockpiles typically build during the summer in preparation for
the heating season, the EIA said in a  summer fuels outlook 
report.  Nationwide, demand for diesel and heating oil slid 26,000
barrels to 3.82 million barrels a day, the lowest level since
May 31, data showed.  “Two Chicago refiners are selling into the low demand,”
saidEd Malloy, president of Danaher Oil Co. in Fairfield,  Iowa .  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in Chicago
gained 1.5 cents to 9 cents a gallon under futures after earlier
weakening to a 12-cent discount.  Inventories of  motor fuel  in the region, referred to as
PADD 2, climbed 257,000 barrels to 48 million, the first
increase in three weeks, EIA data showed. The fuel traded at a
premium of 16.25 cents to CBOB on the  Gulf Coast .  ‘Sky High’  The  3-2-1 crack spread  for Chicago refiners, a rough
measure of refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on
West Texas Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , fell 24 cents
to $20.05 a barrel.  The discount for Gulf Coast CBOB widened for a sixth day to
26.25 cents a gallon below futures.  Gasoline stockpiles  along
the Gulf surged 2.06 million barrels to 78.2 million barrels as
area refineries operated around 95 percent of capacity for a
third consecutive week, according to EIA data.  “We’re running refineries sky high,” said Carl Larry,
president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the Gulf slipped 0.13 cent to a
discount of 3.13 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack  spread on the Gulf, also based on WTI,
slipped $1.12 to $16.24 a gallon. The  same spread  based on Light
Louisiana Sweet oil retreated $1.77 to $9.69 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
