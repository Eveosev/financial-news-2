German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  will offer as much as 100 million euros ($132 million)
as  Germany ’s contribution to a fund to lend to Greek small and
medium-sized businesses, a government official said.  The money would be contingent upon  Greece  meeting certain
terms, the official told reporters in Berlin today on condition
of anonymity because the matter is still subject to discussion
between the two governments.  Schaeuble, who is stopping off in Athens tomorrow on his
way to a meeting in Moscow of finance chiefs from the Group of
20 nations, is visiting Greece at the invitation of Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras’s government. He will use the trip to
express confidence in the government’s resolve to implement the
economic reforms it has pledged to tackle and to offer the
government his encouragement, the official said.  While in  Athens , Schaeuble will discuss ways to help Greece
by means of technical cooperation, the official said. That
includes exploring if and how Germany can contribute to a Greek
financing institution that would lend to companies.  At a meeting with members of the German-Greek trade
chamber, Schaeuble plans to learn about investment opportunities
in Greece and obstacles to doing business there, according to
the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
