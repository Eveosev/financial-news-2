Spain  has covered 63.2 percent of
its  issuance target  for 2013 including short-term bills after a
debt sale yesterday and is open to other forms of funding, an
Economy Ministry official said.  The Treasury in  Madrid  will consider ways of diversifying
its funding methods with instruments such as longer-dated bonds,
inflation-linked bonds or dollar bonds if positive  market
sentiment  continues, said the official, who asked not to be
named in line with government policy.  The yield on Spain’s  benchmark 10-year bond  has fallen
about 300 basis points since European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  pledged to support the euro in July 2012. Still,
with the economy shrinking, the government is struggling to deal
with its fiscal burden. The European Commission forecasts that
debt will rise to 97 percent of output next year from 84 percent
in 2012.  Spain’s public-debt target continues to be 91.4 percent of
gross domestic product at the end of 2013, even after the ratio
rose to 89.6 percent in May, the Economy Ministry said today.  Spain’s 10-year yield rose three basis points to 4.72
percent at 11:37 a.m. in Madrid. The Treasury has sold 85.3
billion euros ($112 billion) of medium- and long-term debt and
59.9 billion euros of bills this year, according to the
official. That compares with a maximum 2013 target of 230
billion euros, the official said.  Excluding short-term bills, Spain has completed 70.3
percent of planned medium- and long-term funding, according to
the  Economy Ministry .  The Treasury is due to hold an auction of three-year, five-year and 10-year bonds tomorrow. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said yesterday he expects a good result from the sale.
He also said the euro region’s fourth-largest economy is
beginning to  recover  and there are signs domestic demand is
stabilizing.  The Treasury’s borrowing costs rose in a sale of six and
12-month bills yesterday. That auction came less than a week
after Spain sold a 15-year bond through banks, the longest-dated
syndicated security since 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
