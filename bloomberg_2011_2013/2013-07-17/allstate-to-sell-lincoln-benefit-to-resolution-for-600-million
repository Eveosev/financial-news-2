Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. auto and home insurer, agreed to sell Lincoln
Benefit Life Co. and will stop issuing fixed annuities at the
end of this year as it seeks to limit risk at its life unit.  Resolution Life Holdings Inc. will buy Lincoln Benefit for
$600 million, Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate said today in
a statement. The deal will reduce the amount of capital Allstate
Financial, the insurer’s life unit, will have to hold by about
$1 billion and generate cash proceeds of approximately $785
million, including tax benefits.  “This will sharpen Allstate Financial’s focus on the
Allstate agency channel,” Chief Executive Officer  Thomas Wilson 
said in the statement. “This action also advances Allstate’s
key priorities, including reducing exposure to spread-based
business and interest rates.”  Insurers have sought to sell life and annuities assets as
low interest rates pressure returns.  Axa SA (CS)  agreed in April to
sell a U.S. life unit to  Protective Life Corp. (PL)  as part of a
$1.06 billion transaction. Sun Life Financial Inc. announced a
deal last year to sell its U.S. annuity business for $1.35
billion.  Normal after-tax returns had averaged about 1 percent of
transaction reserves at Lincoln Benefit, Allstate said in the
statement. The unit had $341 million of premiums and contract
charges, or 15 percent of Allstate Financial’s 2012 total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
