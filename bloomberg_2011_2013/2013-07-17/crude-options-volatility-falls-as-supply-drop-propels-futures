Crude options volatility fell below
21 percent for the first time in 10 days as a drop in crude
inventories propelled futures higher.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options value, was 20.69 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 2:50 p.m., down from 21.68 yesterday.
It was the third consecutive decline and the first time
volatility has dipped below 21 percent since July 2.  West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery
advanced 66 cents to settle at $106.35 a barrel on the Nymex.
The front-month August contract gained 48 cents to $106.48.  Prices rose as the Energy Information Administration
reported that  crude stockpiles  dropped 6.9 million barrels last
week to 367 million, the lowest level since Jan. 18.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
September $95 puts, which slipped 2 cents to 31 cents a barrel
on volume of 7,672 lots traded at 2:54 p.m. September $125 calls
were the second-most active, falling 1 cent to 7 cents on volume
of 5,884 contracts.  Puts accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the prior session, bearish options made up 56 percent of
173,510 contracts exchanged.  September $100 puts were the most-active options yesterday,
with 12,156 contracts changing hands as they gained 7 cents to
87 cents a barrel. August $110 calls dropped 6 cents to 3 cents
on 6,354 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
39,014 contracts. Next were September $90 puts with 37,294 lots
and December $90 puts with 36,617.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
