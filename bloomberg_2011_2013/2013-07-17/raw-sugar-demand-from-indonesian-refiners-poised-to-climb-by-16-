Private refiners in Indonesia, the
world’s largest sugar buyer, may import 16 percent more of the
raw variety this year to meet rising consumption in the domestic
 food industry  and as new processors start production.  Demand may reach 3 million tons, said Faiz Achmad, food
industry director at the Industry Ministry. That compares with
2.58 million tons last year, according to data from the
Indonesian Sugar Council. Total raw imports may rise about 6
percent to 3.6 million tons in the year through April, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates.  Sugar slumped 18 percent in  New York  this year, touching a
three-year low yesterday, after a millers group forecast a
record harvest in  Thailand , the second-biggest exporter. The
crop in  India , the second-largest grower, will top demand after
the best start to the monsoon in more than a decade, according
to a Bloomberg survey. Consumption in  Indonesia  has surged 51
percent in the past decade to 5.1 million tons, spurred by
demand from food and beverages, according to USDA data.  “Economic growth has led to an increase in demand,”
Bachrul Chairi, director general of foreign trade at the Trade
Ministry, said today in Jakarta. “Consumption for food and
beverages is rising, therefore we need more imports.”  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy grew 6.02 percent in the
first three months of 2013 from a year ago, after expanding 6.11
percent in the previous quarter. National GDP rose at an average
annual pace of 5.7 percent in the decade through 2012.  The government issued permits last week to import 585,000
tons of raw sugar, including 110,000 tons for three new
refineries, Achmad said by phone yesterday. That brings the
total amount allowed so far to 2.85 million tons, he said.  Raw sugar futures for delivery in October dropped 1 percent
to 16 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. yesterday, after
touching 15.93 cents, the lowest for a most-active contract
since July 1, 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
