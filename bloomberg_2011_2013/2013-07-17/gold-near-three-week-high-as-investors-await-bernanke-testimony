Gold futures fell the most in more
than a week after the dollar rebounded, curbing demand for the
metal as an alternative investment.  The  greenback  climbed as much as 0.4 percent against a
basket of 10 major currencies. The dollar and gold swung between
gains and losses as investors dissected testimony today from
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke for clues to the
central bank’s plans for monetary stimulus. Earlier, the metal
topped $1,300 an ounce for the first time in three weeks.  “The guessing game about the wrapping up of the stimulus
continues, and that has made people nervous, and pushed them
toward cash,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at
Archer Financial Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“Also, the gold market faced some resistance at 1,300.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1 percent to settle
at $1,278.80 at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex, the biggest drop for a
most-active contract since July 5. Earlier, the price reached
$1,301.10, the highest since June 21. Trading was 36 percent
above the average in the past 100 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  If the economy gains more than expected and inflation
accelerates “decisively” toward a 2 percent target, “the pace
of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly,”
Bernanke said. The Fed would also be prepared to increase the
pace “for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in
a context of price stability,” he said.  ETP Plunge  Gold has tumbled 24 percent this year, erasing $60.3
billion from the  value  of exchange-traded products backed by the
metal. Some investors lost faith in the commodity as a store of
value amid an equity rally and muted inflation.  Silver futures for September delivery fell 2.6 percent to
$19.42 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest drop since July 5.  On the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
October delivery dropped 1 percent to $1,411 an ounce. Palladium
futures for September delivery fell less than 0.1 percent to
$735.45 an ounce, ending a seven-session rally, the longest in
10 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
