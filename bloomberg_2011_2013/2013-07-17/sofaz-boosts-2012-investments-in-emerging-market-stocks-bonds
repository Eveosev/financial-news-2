Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund
increased investment in  emerging markets  and lower-rated bonds
last year to boost returns as the Caspian Sea nation cut crude
production for a third year.  The fund raised its emerging-markets holdings to about 14
percent in 2012 from 9.5 percent the year before, the Baku-based
Sofaz, as it’s known, said today on its  website . The European
Union remained the largest destination for its investments at
the end of the year, it said.  Purchases of Turkish and Russian bonds contributed to a
“significant rise” in debt holdings rated A or lower, Sofaz
said. Investments in bonds with the highest AAA rating accounted
for almost 33 percent of Sofaz’s holdings, down from 36 percent
the previous year, and AA-rated notes fell to 11 percent from
14.3 percent in 2011, it said.  Sofaz, established in 1999 to manage income from the sale
of oil and natural gas, had $34.3 billion of assets as of April
1, an increase of 0.6 percent from the end of last year and
equivalent to almost 50 percent of the national economy. It
started investing in gold, real estate, Australian dollars,
Russian rubles and Turkish lira last year to diversify its
holdings.  The third-largest oil producer in the former  Soviet Union 
has cut production since 2010 when output peaked at 51 million
metric tons. Azerbaijan pumped 43 million tons of oil last year,
down from 46 million tons in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
