Corn advanced for a second day on
concern that hot weather in the U.S. may hurt the outlook for a
record crop in the largest grower and exporter. Wheat rose.  Corn for December delivery advanced as much as 0.7 percent
to $5.145 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after climbing
1.4 percent yesterday. It traded at $5.1425 at 11:08 a.m. in
 Singapore  on volume that was 37 percent below for the 100-day
average for that time of day.  Hot temperatures may hit the Midwest in the next three days,
with little rainfall, DTN said in a report yesterday. About 16
percent of corn reached the silking stage, behind a five-year
average of 35 percent, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
July 15. Silking is part of the pollination stage when drought
and high-temperature stress can hurt the yield potential,
according to the  Ohio State  University Extension website.  “Market participants are concerned about a pollination
problem,” Makiko Tsugata, an analyst at Market Risk Advisory Co.
in  Tokyo , said in an e-mail today.  Futures slid 26 percent this year as farmers planted a
record crop, estimated by the USDA at 13.95 billion bushels.  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
$12.905 a bushel, while wheat for September delivery rose 0.3
percent to $6.715 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
