Brazil’s real rose the most among
major currencies as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s
comments and a decline in U.S. housing starts damped speculation
that the central bank will taper stimulus.  The currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 2.24 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:22 a.m. in Sao Paulo after dropping 0.5 percent
earlier today. Swap rates on contracts maturing in January 2015
fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 9.39
percent, the lowest level on a closing basis since June 7.  “The details of Bernanke’s comments were more dovish,”
Marco Antonio Caruso, an economist at Banco Pine SA, said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “Here in Brazil, we have a
stronger real. It’s a risk-on movement.”  Bernanke said in prepared congressional testimony that the
central bank’s asset purchases “are by no means on a preset
course” and could be reduced more quickly or expanded as
economic conditions warrant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
