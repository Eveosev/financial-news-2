St. Jude Medical (STJ)  Inc., the  St. Paul ,
Minnesota-based maker of heart-rhythm devices, surged the most
in 20 months after second-quarter revenue fell less than
analysts had estimated.  St. Jude climbed 5.2 percent to $51 at 4 p.m.  New York  time
for its biggest advance since November 2011. The stock has
increased 41 percent this year.  Second-quarter revenue declined less than 1 percent to $1.4
billion from $1.41 billion a year earlier, St. Jude said today
in a statement. The sales topped the $1.36 billion average of 20
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company  forecast 
full-year profit of $3.70 to $3.73 a share, compared with a
previous projection of at least $3.68.  “Revenues outpaced expectations in every category,”
Brooks West, an analyst with  Piper Jaffray (PJC) , wrote in a research
note today, citing cardiac rhythm management as particularly
strong. “St. Jude also continues to speak to acquisition
criteria which we believe will be used to supplement its growth
strategy.”  Earnings, excluding restructuring costs and other one-time
items, were $275 million, or 96 cents a share. Net income fell
53 percent to $115 million, or 40 cents, from $244 million, or
78 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
