Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) , the
private-equity firm led by Leon Black, told regulators that
capital committed by its Athene insurance unit to the takeover
of Aviva Plc’s U.S. business will provide stable funding.  “Not one dollar of private equity is invested in Athene,”
Grant Kvalheim, president of the unit, said today at a hearing,
held in Des Moines by the Iowa Insurance Division, which
regulates the Aviva unit. “The money invested in Athene is
permanent capital.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Zachary Tracer in  New York  at
