Indian (SENSEX)  stocks rebounded from the
biggest decline in two weeks after the government approved plans
to liberalize foreign investment rules to boost growth.  The S&P BSE Sensex advanced 0.4 percent to 19,926.55 at
9:29 a.m. in Mumbai, after falling the most since July 3
yesterday. Engineering company  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT)  advanced 1.3
percent. Cigarette maker  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , which has the highest
weightage on the index, surged to a record.  Reforms approved yesterday will allow overseas investors to
own all of an Indian telephone company, and increase the 26
percent limit in defense production on a case-by-case basis. The
government has been reviewing caps on foreign investment as it
strives to lure funds to help spur a struggling economy and
finance a current-account deficit that helped push the rupee to
a record low this month.  Indian stocks slumped yesterday after the  Reserve Bank of
India  on July 15 raised two interest rates to try and steady a
currency that has weakened 7.3 percent against the dollar this
year. The rupee’s plunge threatens to spur gains in consumer
prices and prompted the central bank to leave interest rates
unchanged last month, ending a run of three reductions.  Global investors  sold $29.5 million of domestic shares on
July 15, paring this year’s inflows to $12.4 billion, data from
the regulator show. They have sold $929 million worth of Indian
stocks this month, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, extending July’s $1.8 billion sell-off.  To contact the reporter on this story:
