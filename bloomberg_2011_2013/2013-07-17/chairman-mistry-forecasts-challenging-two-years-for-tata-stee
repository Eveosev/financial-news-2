Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ,  India ’s biggest
producer, forecast the next two years to be “challenging”
because of a slowing local economy and a global supply glut.  “The overhang of the economic crisis and significant
overcapacity in regions like  Europe  and  China  continues to
stress global capacity utilization and the demand supply
balance,” Chairman Cyrus Mistry said in the company’s annual
report published today. “The Indian economy has slowed down in
the last 12 months and some of the sectors including the
automotive and capital goods have been faced with a demand
slowdown that is unlikely to turn around quickly.”  Tata Steel, whose European unit accounts for two-thirds of
its total output, and other European steelmakers such as
 ArcelorMittal (MT)  and  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  reported a quarterly loss in
three months ended March 31 as Europe’s economic crisis sapped
demand and slower Chinese growth weighed on commodity prices.
Tata Steel wrote down $1.6 billion of mostly overseas asset
values, including $1.35 billion for Europe, in the period.  Europe has about 210 million metric tons of annual
steelmaking capacity, while demand in a “normal market” is 150
million to 160 million tons, according to industry lobby group
Eurofer.  Steel use in the European Union fell 9.3 percent in 2012
and is expected to contract a further 0.5 percent this year,
Tata Steel said in its annual report. Demand may increase 3.3
percent in 2014 to 144.1 million tons, it said.  Steel Demand  Tata Steel shares fell as much as 1.4 percent to 248.05
rupees in Mumbai, the lowest since April 29, 2009. They traded
at 249 rupees as of 10:52 a.m. local time. The benchmark
Sensitive Index climbed 0.6 percent.  Steel demand is 30 percent lower than the pre-2008
financial crisis levels and the outlook for the euro area
continues to be depressed, Mistry said. Hot-rolled steel coil, a
benchmark product used in automobiles and buildings, declined 11
percent to an average price of 477 euros ($627) a ton this year
from the previous 12 months, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on data from Metal Bulletin.  European car sales slumped to a two-decade low in June,
while a report yesterday showed investor confidence in  Germany ,
Europe’s largest economy, unexpectedly declined in July, adding
to signs the region is struggling to emerge from recession.  In the last fiscal year, Tata Steel added 2.9 million tons
of capacity to its main plant in India, enhancing its total
capacity by almost a third to 9.7 million tons. The company is
in the process of building a 6 million ton-factory in the
eastern state of Odisha, with half the capacity planned for the
first phase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
