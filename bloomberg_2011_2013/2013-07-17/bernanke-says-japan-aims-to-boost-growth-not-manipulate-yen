Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Japan doesn’t manipulate the yen to gain an edge
for the nation’s exports, calling its recent monetary policy
part of a wider strategy aimed at boosting the world’s third-largest economy.  Responding to questions from the House Financial Services
Committee today, Bernanke drew a distinction between the
currency policies of Japan and China, which he said manages the
value of the  yuan  to keep it below its market value.  “The Japanese approach is different. They’re not
manipulating their exchange rate, they’re not directly trying to
set their exchange rate at a given level,” Bernanke said.  “It’s in our interest to see Japan strengthen,” he said.
“Japan is trying to expand its overall economy and therefore
there is a benefit as well as a cost. That benefit is a stronger
Japanese economy and a stronger Asian market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
