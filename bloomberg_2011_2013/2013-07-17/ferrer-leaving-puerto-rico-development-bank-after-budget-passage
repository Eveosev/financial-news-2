Javier Ferrer, president of Puerto
Rico’s Government Development Bank and the commonwealth’s top
financial manager, will leave the bank this month.  Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla appointed Ferrer to head
the bank, which handles the island’s capital-markets
transactions and advises on budget and fiscal issues, after
taking office in January.  Ferrer will leave July 19, Jesus Manuel Ortiz, spokesman
for the governor, said in an e-mail. Jose Pagan, the bank’s
executive vice president for financing, will serve as interim
president, Ortiz said.  The governor is trying to keep Puerto Rico’s credit rating
from falling below investment grade. The three major credit-rating companies grade the commonwealth one step above junk,
with a negative outlook.  The administration of Garcia Padilla, a member of the
Popular Democratic Party, has passed pension changes that boost
the retirement age and increase employee contributions. The
governor last month signed a budget for the fiscal year that
began July 1 that reduces Puerto Rico’s recurring deficit by
increasing taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
