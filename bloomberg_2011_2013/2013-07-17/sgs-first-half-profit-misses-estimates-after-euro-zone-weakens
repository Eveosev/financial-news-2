SGS SA (SGSN) , the world’s largest product
inspector, reported lower-than-expected first-half profit after
restructuring costs in Europe and a slowdown in parts of its
minerals business.  Net income rose 10 percent to 265 million francs ($281
million), the Geneva-based company said in a  statement  today.
That missed the average 296 million-franc estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales increased 7.2 percent to
2.9 billion francs excluding currencies.  “Economies in the Eurozone continued to weaken during the
semester necessitating further restructuring of our operations
there,” said SGS. Restructuring resulted in one-time costs of
12 million francs, it said.  SGS is a gauge of the broader economy as it sells
verification and testing services for industries from
agriculture to finance. The company reiterated an earlier
forecast for “solid” top- and bottom-line growth in 2013. The
company announced four acquisitions this year in China,  South
Africa  and the U.S. as it seeks to reach a sales target of 8
billion francs by the end of 2014.  Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA (GBLB)  became an SGS shareholder last
month after paying 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) for a 15
percent stake owned by  Exor SpA (EXO) , the Agnelli family holding
company which controls  Fiat SpA. (F)  Billionaire August Von Finck
and members of his family own 14.97 percent of the company,
which started in 1878 as a grain inspection house.  To contact the reporter on this story:
