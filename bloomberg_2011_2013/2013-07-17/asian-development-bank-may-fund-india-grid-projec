The Asian Development Bank plans to
give a second loan to upgrade state power grids in  India  to help
solar plants sell electricity.  The Manila-based lender approved a  $100 million loan  to
western Gujarat state in 2011 to build transmission lines and
equipment for the nation’s largest solar park. That encouraged
private developers to build plants quickly as it saved them the
cost of connecting to the grid individually.  The ADB is planning a similar investment in neighboring
Rajasthan state, Yongping Zhai, director of the energy division
at the bank’s South Asia department, said by phone from  Manila .  The investment will be co-financed by the $5.2 billion
 Clean Technology Fund , which is backed by five development
banks, he said. The lender may approve the loan by the end of
the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
