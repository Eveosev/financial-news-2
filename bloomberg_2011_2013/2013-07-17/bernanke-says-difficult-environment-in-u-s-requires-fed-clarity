The U.S. faces a “difficult
environment” economically and financially, increasing the
importance of the central bank’s ability to communicate its
policies, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said.  “I think markets are beginning to understand our message,
and the volatility has obviously moderated,” Bernanke said in
response to questions from the House Financial Services
Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
