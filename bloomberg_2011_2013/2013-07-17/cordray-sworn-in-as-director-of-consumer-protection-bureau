President  Barack Obama  said the
confirmation of  Richard Cordray  as director of the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau will make a “positive difference”
in the lives of U.S. consumers.  “Americans everywhere are better off” because of the
protections middle-income families are afforded by the
operations of the bureau, Obama said today at a White House
ceremony shortly after Cordray was sworn in. The agency will
help keep in check the “strain of irresponsibility” in the
financial sector that led to the financial crisis, he said.  Cordray said the bureau will help provide certainty for
financial service providers as well as for consumers.  Cordray was confirmed by the Senate yesterday. The 66-34
vote ended a battle between the Obama administration and Senate
Republicans over the structure of the agency and the use of
presidential appointment powers that created uncertainty over
the legality of agency’s rulings and enforcement actions.  Obama appeared with Cordray in the State Dining Room. Among
those in the audience was Democratic Senator  Elizabeth Warren  of
Massachusetts. Warren helped set up the bureau as an aide to
Obama and recruited Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general, to
be its first director.  The president thanked the Democratic and Republican leaders
in the Senate and  Arizona  Senator  John McCain  for brokering the
agreement that cleared the way for the confirmation of Cordray
and other key nominations that had been held up by Republican
objections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
