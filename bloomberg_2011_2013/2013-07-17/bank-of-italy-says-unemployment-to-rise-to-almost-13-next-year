The  Bank of Italy  said the recession
in the euro-area’s third-biggest economy is worse than expected
and unemployment, already at a record high, is set to climb next
year even after activity starts to improve.  Joblessness will probably rise to almost 13 percent before
“demonstrating a timid recovery” in the second half of 2014,
the central bank said today in its mid-year economic bulletin.
Unemployment advanced to 12.2 percent in May, the highest since
the data series began in 1977.  Italy is struggling through its longest recession in more
than two decades as banks curb lending to companies and
joblessness hurts  consumer spending . Prime Minister Enrico
Letta, in his third month on the job, is trying to enforce
budget rigor while seeking to stimulate the economy by paying
public administration debts owed to private-sector suppliers. He
has also pressed the European Union for funds to boost
employment.  “Downside risks, principally tied to the global economic
outlook, liquidity conditions for companies and the supply of
credit, threaten the economic recovery at the end of 2013 and
the beginning of 2014,” the Bank of  Italy  said.  Italian gross domestic product is expected to decline 1.9
percent this year, the central bank said. That’s down from its
January forecast of a 1 percent contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
