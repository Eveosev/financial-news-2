Chris Froome won the final Tour de
France time trial by 9 seconds over  Alberto Contador  to extend
his race lead.  Froome recovered from a slower start than Contador in a  20-mile stage over two climbs  between Embrun and Chorges to boost
his lead to 4 minutes, 34 seconds. Joaquim Rodriguez was a
second further back in third today.  Two-time champion Contador  rose to second  and Roman
Kreuziger third overall, both Team Saxo Bank riders overtaking
Bauke Mollema who bashed into a guardrail on a bend about a mile
from the end of the stage.  Mollema managed to stay on his bike, pushing himself away
from the rail with his hand.  AG2R-La Mondiale’s Jean Christophe Peraud, the top-ranked
French rider at ninth before today’s 17th stage, abandoned the
race after crashing on the same turn.  Peraud was already riding with a broken collarbone after an
accident on a warm-up ride earlier today.  Descending for many of the riders was made trickier after
rain began falling during the stage.  Riders climb the Alpe d’Huez twice tomorrow, finishing a
107-mile stage atop the mountain. The race ends July 21 in
Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
