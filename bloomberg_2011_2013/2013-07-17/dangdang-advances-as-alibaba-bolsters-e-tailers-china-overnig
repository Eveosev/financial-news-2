Chinese stocks climbed in  New York ,
as  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  soared, after a jump in profit
at Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. bolstered the outlook for online
retailers.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded

the highest close since June 7. Dangdang, the country’s biggest

percent to $1.4 billion as it prepares for a possible initial
public offering. China’s State Council said this month that it
will boost financial support for industries including
 information technology  as the nation reduces its reliance on
exports and heavy industries for growth.  “Alibaba’s top revenue suggests extremely strong growth in
the e-commerce business,” Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at
Oberweis Asset Management Inc., which holds Dangdang and
clothing retailer  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  among its $700 million
of assets, said in a phone interview from Lisle, Illinois. “The
market is huge. There’s potential for continued growth.”  The iShares China Large-Cap ETF, the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., gained 0.6 percent to $33.83.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.3 percent as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s testimony to Congress eased
concern that the central bank was planning to curtail stimulus.  Dangdang Jumps  Dangdang climbed 9.1 percent to $7.64, while Vipshop, based
in  Guangzhou , added 8.2 percent to a two-month high of $35.78.  Online retailing in China more than doubled each year from
2003 to 2011 and is projected to more than triple to $395
billion from 2011 to 2015, according to a McKinsey & Co. report
in March. China’s Internet users rose to 591 million in June,
from 564 million in December, according to the China Internet
Network Information Center website.  The State Council pledged in a statement on July 5 to
improve financial support for growth industries including
information technology and environmental protection.  American depositary receipts of  Yanzhou Coal Mining Ltd. (YZC) 
gained 3.5 percent to $7.46. The ADRs traded 2.8 percent above
equivalent shares in  Hong Kong , the highest premium in four
days.  Baidu Gains  SouFun fell to $31.80, after rallying 19 percent to a
record on July 16. Trading volume yesterday was three times the
daily average of the past three months. The company said in a
statement that it’s “not aware of any particular reason for the
unusual market activity in the company’s stock and is operating
as usual.”  LightInTheBox Holding Co. (LITB) , the first Chinese company to go

percent since its initial public offering on June 6 when it
raised $79 million.  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of China’s biggest online search engine,

Baidu said July 16 that it agreed to buy mobile application
store 91 Wireless for $1.9 billion, its biggest announced
acquisition, to gain a greater share of the wireless user
market.  Moody’s Investors Service Ltd. said yesterday that the
purchase would have no immediate impact on Baidu’s A3 credit
rating as the company has “sufficient cash” to fund the deal.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in Hong Kong climbed
0.7 percent to 9,480.85, while the Shanghai Composite Index
dropped 1 percent to 2,044.92.  To contact the reporter on this story:
