BP Plc (BP/)  asked a federal judge to
temporarily halt payments from the court-supervised settlement
program set up after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill while
 Louis Freeh  investigates possible misconduct.  BP filed its request for an emergency halt to the
distributions today in federal court in New Orleans.  “A temporary pause of all claims payments is prudent and
necessary during Judge Freeh’s investigation into allegations of
corruption within the claims program,” BP spokesman  Geoff Morrell  said in a statement. “Already two of the three senior
attorneys at the program have been terminated, and there is a
material risk that payments going out the door have been and
continue to be tainted.”  U.S. District Judge  Carl Barbier  ordered the investigation
by Freeh, a former federal judge and director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, on July 2, after a staff attorney at
the program was suspended for allegedly taking fees from law
firms while processing their clients’ claims from the oil spill
settlement.  The case is In Re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).  To contact the reporter on this story:
