The American League ended a three-game losing streak in Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game with
a 3-0 victory at New York’s Citi Field.  Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees and nine other AL
pitchers combined to hold the NL team to three hits. Rivera, who
is retiring after this season as baseball’s career saves leader,
was named Most Valuable Player.  The win gives the AL champion home-field advantage in the
World Series. Since MLB decided in 2003 that its All-Star Game
would determine home field advantage, the winning league is 7-3
in the World Series. That includes the last four champions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
