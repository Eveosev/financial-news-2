Greenhill & Co. (GHL) , the advisory firm
founded by Robert Greenhill, said second-quarter profit rose
seven-fold as advisory revenue almost doubled.  Net income climbed to $15.5 million, or 52 cents a share,
from $2.2 million, or 7 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based firm said today in a statement. The  average estimate  of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings of 53
cents a share.  Greenhill Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok, 54, said last
month in a Bloomberg Television interview that companies’ desire
to expand geographically and add new products will drive mergers
and acquisitions. Global announced deal volume climbed 6.1
percent in the second quarter from the first period of this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We particularly benefited in the first half from a
larger number of lead roles on major transactions, resulting in
more large fees compared to last year,” Greenhill said in
today’s statement.  Greenhill rose 0.3 percent to close at $46.21 in  New York .
The shares have slid 11 percent this year, compared with the 23
percent advance of the  Russell 2000 Index. (RTY)   To contact the reporter on this story:
