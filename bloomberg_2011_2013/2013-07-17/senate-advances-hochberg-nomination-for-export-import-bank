The Senate advanced the nomination
of  Fred Hochberg  for a second term as president of the U.S.
Export-Import Bank.  The 82-18 vote clears the way for debate and a final
confirmation vote, probably later today. The action is a result
of this week’s agreement between Senate Republicans and
Democrats to consider confirmation of several of President
 Barack Obama ’s executive appointments while avoiding a change in
the chamber’s rules.  The Senate also plans this week to vote on the nominations
of  Thomas Perez  for labor secretary and Gina McCarthy to lead
the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Export-Import Bank provides assistance to purchases of
U.S. products by foreign entities. Congress last year raised its
lending limit to $140 billion through September 2014.  The Senate yesterday confirmed, on a 66-34 vote,  Richard
Cordray  as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Cordray was nominated twice and waited more than 700 days
for a confirmation vote. Obama installed him in the director
post in January 2012 using a so-called recess appointment, which
bypasses Senate confirmation.  In exchange for proceeding with Cordray’s confirmation,
Obama agreed to nominate two new candidates to the National
Labor Relations Board to replace two he had installed as recess
appointments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
