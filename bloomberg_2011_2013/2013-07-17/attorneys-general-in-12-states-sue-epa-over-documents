The  attorneys general  of 12 states
sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, alleging it
unfairly denied a freedom of information request seeking
documents on settlements.  The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City
yesterday, seeks an order requiring the agency to immediately
turn over documents related to settlements of claims brought by
non-government environmental organizations.  The attorneys general of Oklahoma, Michigan and 10 other
states also asked the federal court to order the EPA to waive
the fee for producing the material.  Alisha Johnson, an EPA spokeswoman, didnâ€™t immediately
respond to a call for comment on the suit.  The case is Pruitt v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
13-cv-00726, U.S. District Court, Western District of Oklahoma
(Oklahoma City).  To contact the reporter on this story:
