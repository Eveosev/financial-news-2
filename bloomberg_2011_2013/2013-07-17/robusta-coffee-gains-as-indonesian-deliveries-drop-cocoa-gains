Robusta coffee climbed for a third
day in  London  as slow deliveries from farms in Indonesia, the
world’s third-biggest producer, combined with farmers in leading
grower  Vietnam  holding onto beans. Cocoa rose as sugar slid.  Coffee deliveries in Indonesia fell 28 percent from last
year as wet weather delayed bean-drying, according to Amsterdam-based trader Nedcoffee BV. Deliveries to Bandar Lampung, where
the country’s main coffee export port is located, amounted to
77,719 metric tons from the start of the season through July 5,
compared with 108,342 tons a year earlier, the trader said in a
monthly report e-mailed yesterday. Farmers and middlemen in
Vietnam still hold 21 percent of the crop, it said.  “The difficulty moving production in  Indonesia  is
compounding the problem caused by slow Vietnamese movements,”
said Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in
 Chicago , in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Robusta coffee for September delivery gained 0.4 percent to
$1,953 a ton by 11:10 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London, after rising
to $1,965 a ton yesterday, the highest for a most-active
contract since May 24. Arabica coffee for delivery in September
was 0.3 percent higher at $1.2635 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . It rose 2.2 percent yesterday. Futures trading volumes
were 65 percent higher than the average for the past 100 days
for this time of day.  Farmers in Indonesia’s main growing region of southern
Sumatra harvested 137,350 tons of coffee since the start of the
season, estimates Nedcoffee. That compares with 140,450 tons a
year earlier. Growers and middlemen in Vietnam held 314,892 tons
as of July 1, the trader said. While Indonesia is harvesting its
2013-14 crop, Vietnam’s 2012-13 season will end in September.  Cold Weather  Brazil , the world’s top producer of coffee and leading
arabica grower, will get cold weather next week, Somar
Meteorologia said in a report e-mailed yesterday. While
temperatures will decline sharply in coffee areas of  Sao Paulo 
and Minas Gerais states, there is no risk of frost, said Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agronomist at the company.  “While it is going to be colder in Brazil July 23 to July
25, we are not of the opinion that it will go below freezing,
and the area affected is rather small,” Citigroup’s Smith said.  Cocoa for September delivery gained 0.9 percent to 1,597
pounds ($2,428) a ton in London, the highest for this contract
since Dec. 4. Cocoa for September delivery advanced 1.1 percent
to $2,315 a ton in New York.  Cocoa processing in Asia rose 2 percent in the second
quarter to 153,792 tons from the same period a year earlier, the
Singapore-based Cocoa Association of  Asia  said by e-mail today.
Grindings in the first quarter were revised up to 153,932 to
take into account new members of the organization, it said.  White sugar for October delivery was down 0.4 percent at
$458.80 a ton on NYSE Liffe, and touched $458.40, the lowest
price for a most-active contract since June 2010. Raw sugar for
delivery in October fell 0.2 percent to 15.97 cents a pound on
ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
