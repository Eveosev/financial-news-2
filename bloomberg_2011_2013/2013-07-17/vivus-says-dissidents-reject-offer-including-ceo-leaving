Vivus Inc. (VVUS) , the drugmaker battling
its largest shareholder for control of the company, said the
dissident investor rejected a settlement offer that included
four of nine board seats and the chief executive officer’s
retirement.  Vivus proposed equal representation on its board to First
 Manhattan  Co., with each side getting four seats and an
independent investor representative getting the ninth, the
 Mountain View , California-based company said today in a
statement. Leland Wilson offered to resign from the board and
retire as CEO when the company hired a successor.  The proposal is at least the second that Vivus, which makes
the obesity drug Qsymia, has offered First Manhattan; on July
13, Vivus said it invited three dissident nominees to join the
board in an attempt to reach a compromise. The next day, Vivus
said it delayed its annual meeting by three days, to July 18.  Yesterday, First Manhattan, which owns 9.9 percent of
Vivus’s outstanding shares, sued the company and claimed it had
enough votes on the eve of the meeting to win the proxy fight.  “It is our desire to end this closely contested proxy
battle without handing the company over to Mr. Colin ahead of
the vote,” Wilson said in the statement today, referring to Sam Colin, senior managing director at First Manhattan. “We believe
our proposal, which included my stepping down as CEO of Vivus,
was extremely fair and balanced.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
