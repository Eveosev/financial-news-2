Brazil ’s securities regulator
started an investigation into billionaire  Eike Batista ’s OGX
Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA after a minority investor lodged
a complaint over alleged insider trading.  The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission, known as
CVM, opened the review after a request by OGX individual
investor Rafael Ferri, according to a statement on the
regulator’s  website  dated today. The complaint relates to
Batista’s sale of 126.7 million OGX shares between May and June
before the company scrapped projects and warned it may stop
pumping crude next year, Ferri said in an e-mailed statement.  Batista’s six publicly traded ventures have lost about $10
billion in value this year, led by an 88 percent drop in OGX.
The shares  slumped  a record 29 percent on July 1 when the
company said it may shut its only crude oil producing wells next
year after output reached a fraction of original targets.  EBX Group Co., the holding for most of Batista’s assets,
declined to comment on the CVM’s review. OGX’s press office in
Rio didn’t immediately have a comment when contacted by
 Bloomberg News  today. An official at CVM said the regulator
doesn’t comment on individual cases.  Batista sold 56.2 million shares of OGX in June after
divesting 70.5 million shares in late May as he seeks to raise
cash to pay back debts. OGX shares  gained  4.1 percent to 51
centavos in  Sao Paulo  trading today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
