German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  will push fellow Group of 20 countries to set debt-reduction targets for the period after 2016 as a follow-up to
commitments made in Toronto in 2010, a government official said.  Schaeuble wants to bolster the  Russian G-20 presidency ’s
goal to seek consensus on country-specific medium- and long-term
public debt targets and develop strategies to achieve them, the
German official told reporters in Berlin today on condition of
anonymity because the negotiations are private. G-20 finance
chiefs are scheduled to meet in Moscow on July 19-20.  While it’s unrealistic to expect agreement on debt limits
of 60 percent of gross domestic product, which would mirror the
rules governing the 17-nation euro region, concrete country-specific targets that don’t diverge too widely are realistic,
the German official said.  Germany  will continue to push for debt stabilization by
2016 in line with the Toronto commitments and that medium-term
goals and debt-reduction trajectories be set for the years from
2017, the official said. No concrete targets or trajectories are
likely to be discussed in Moscow this week, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
