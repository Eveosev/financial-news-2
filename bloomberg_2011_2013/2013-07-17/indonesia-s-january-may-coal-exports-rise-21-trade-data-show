Indonesia , the world’s largest
exporter of coal used in power stations, shipped 21 percent more
of the fuel in the first five months of this year, Trade
Ministry data show.  The country exported 163.69 million metric tons from
January to May, according to the data distributed by e-mail
today. That’s up from 134.98 million in the same period in 2012.
The ministry didn’t provide a reason for the gain in exports.  Rising supply from new and existing mines has put pressure
on prices amid increased demand for thermal coal, according to
Supriatna Suhala, the  executive director  at the Indonesian Coal
Mining Association in Jakarta.  “Supply is still abundant because countries, not only
Indonesia, are stepping up their production,” he said in a
phone interview today.  Coal prices  have dropped by more than half since mid-2008
amid slowing Chinese imports and rising output from producers
including Indonesia and  Colombia . Thermal coal at the Australian
port of Newcastle, a benchmark grade for  Asia , was $76.40 a ton
in the week ended July 12, according to IHS McCloskey, a
Petersfield, U.K.-based provider of coal data. The price reached
a record $192.50 in July 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
