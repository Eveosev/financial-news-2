British spies didn’t break the law
when they used data collected by the U.S. National Security
Agency’s Prism program, a panel of lawmakers concluded.  Campaign groups including Privacy International said
General Communications Headquarters, the U.K.’s signals-intelligence agency, had breached the rules after the extent of
U.S. surveillance programs was exposed by whistle-blower Edward Snowden.  In a statement today, Parliament’s Intelligence and
Security Committee, which oversees GCHQ, described such
allegations as “unfounded.” “In each case where GCHQ sought
information from the U.S., a warrant for interception, signed by
a minister, was already in place, in accordance with the legal
safeguards,” the panel said.  The ISC did suggest that the laws governing interception of
communications, which were most recently changed in 2000, should
be re-examined.  Snowden, a U.S. security contractor, leaked details of NSA
programs that collect telephone and Internet data. American
prosecutors are seeking his return from  Russia , where he sought
asylum from theft and espionage charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
