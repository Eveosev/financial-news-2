The  Crown Estate , which manages the
seabed in British waters, invited bids from developers for
offshore wind projects that don’t require grid connection in a
effort to reduce costs of the technology.  It called for expressions of interest on projects that
allow for the test and demonstration of offshore equipment such
as new foundations for turbines and cable-laying, the Crown
Estate said today in a statement. Novel technologies for
operations and maintenance of turbines at sea may also apply.  The authority called for developers with a specific project
that don’t have a defined test site, or those with existing
rights to the seabed that are seeking permission for a
demonstration project, to apply to collaborate on joint
ventures. The deadline for bids is Sept. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
