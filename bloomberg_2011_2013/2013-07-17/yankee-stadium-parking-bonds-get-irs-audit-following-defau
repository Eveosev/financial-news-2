The  Internal Revenue Service  is
reviewing $237.6 million of tax-exempt debt used to finance
parking garages at New York’s Yankee Stadium, according to a
securities filing.  It’s the latest hurdle for the project after Bronx Parking
Development Co. in April missed a payment to bondholders,
defaulting on the debt. A month earlier, the company hired the
law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher as bankruptcy counsel.  The IRS is examining the revenue bonds “to determine
compliance with the federal tax requirements,” according to the
filing today.  Bronx Parking issued tax-exempt bonds in 2007 through  New
York City ’s Industrial Development Agency to build three garages
and renovate two others. The structures haven’t generated enough
revenue as more fans take public transportation to the Major
League Baseball stadium. It costs $35 to park at the facility.  Holders of the debt in May said they wouldn’t sue Bronx
Parking to enforce their claims on revenue or seek an
acceleration of payments, which prevented an immediate
bankruptcy filing.  The next scheduled payment is $8.1 million on Oct. 1.
Steven Polivy, an attorney at Akerman Senterfitt LLP who
represents Bronx Parking, and Edward Moran, its financial
adviser, didn’t immediately respond to e-mails requesting
comment on the filing.  The IRS is prohibited from commenting by law, Bruce Friedland, a spokesman for the agency, said by telephone.  Bonds due October 2037 traded as low as 44.19 cents on the
dollar July 2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
