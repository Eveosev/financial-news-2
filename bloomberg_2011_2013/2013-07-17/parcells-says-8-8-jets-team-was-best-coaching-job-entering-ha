Bill Parcells  said his best
performance during a 22-year National Football League coaching
career might have been with an 8-8 New York Jets team, not his
two Super Bowl-champion New York Giants squads.  Parcells, who will be inducted into the  Pro Football Hall
of Fame  on Aug. 3, said his best coaching was in 1999, with a
Jets’ team that lost starting quarterback Vinny Testaverde for
the season in its opening game and was 1-6 before rallying to a
.500 finish.  “Holding that team together to accomplish that was
probably one of the better things,” Parcells, 71, said on a
media conference call. “Most coaches will tell you, when you
start 1-6 it’s tough to maintain the things you need to be
successful.”  Parcells’s successes included  Super Bowl  titles after the
1986 and 1990 seasons, and another trip to the championship game
with the  New England Patriots  after the 1996 campaign.  Parcells, who played football at Colgate University,
coached in college from 1964 until becoming the Giants’
defensive coordinator in 1979.  He took over as coach in 1983 and stepped down after
winning his second Super Bowl in his 11th season leading the
franchise. He coached the Patriots from 1993 to 1996, then moved
to the Jets in 1997, staying for three years. He finished his
career with the  Dallas Cowboys  from 2003 to 2006, retiring with
a 172-130-1 record.  Memorable Moment  Parcells said his most memorable moment was the January
1991 National Football Conference championship in  San Francisco ,
which the Giants won 15-13 with a team that included quarterback
Jeff Hostetler, tight end Mark Bavaro, running back Dave Meggett
and linebacker Lawrence Taylor. On the losing side were future
Hall of Fame players Joe Montana and  Jerry Rice .  “There were so many great players playing in that game,”
Parcells said. “That’s what makes it memorable to me.”  Former Giants defensive end George Martin will present
Parcells at the induction ceremony in Canton,  Ohio . The others
to be enshrined are  Larry Allen , Cris Carter, Curley Culp,
Jonathan Ogden, Dave Robinson and Warren Sapp.  The Giants had one winning season in the 10 years before
Parcells took over. He led the Patriots to 10-6 from 2-14 in two
years, and in the same amount of time took the Jets to 12-4 from
1-15.  Often combative with players and media members, Parcells
said his reputation as a great motivator was “very, very much
overrated.”  “I think it’s impossible, as a matter of fact, to motivate
someone who’s not a self-starter in that regard,” he said. “I
viewed myself as a teacher. I grew up in a family that was
confrontational, so I think I carried some of that with me.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
