Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  advanced for a sixth day, trading near the highest in
almost three months, as  iron ore  rallied and on expectations
that China will boost economic growth.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed as much as 0.5 percent to 3,695  yuan  ($601)
before trading at 3,689 yuan at 10:42 a.m. local time. The
contract rose to 3,700 yuan on July 11, the highest price for a
most-active contract since April 22.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port advanced
for a sixth day yesterday, adding 1.7 percent to $129 a dry ton,
the highest since May 13, according to The Steel Index Ltd.
Premier Li Keqiang yesterday said the government will seek to
keep economic growth, employment and inflation within limits,
avoiding “wide fluctuations.”  “Higher raw-material costs and policy expectations have
kept the market quite strong, despite a lean-demand season in
China,” said Dang Man, an analyst at Maike Futures Co. in Xi’an.  The average spot price for rebar in China climbed 0.7
percent to 3,437 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
