Macau gaming receipts are expected
to see a “visible” slowdown in the second half of the year as
high-stake gamblers contribute a smaller percentage of casino
revenue, the city’s monetary authority said.  The VIP gaming segment, which caters to gamblers playing
for high stakes, has been losing market share to the mass
market, slowing overall industry growth, the Macau’s Monetary
Authority  said  in a July research bulletin on its website.  While Macau counts on high-stakes bettors for two thirds of
its revenue, the mass market is growing faster. The share of VIP
in gaming revenue dropped to 68 percent in the first quarter of
this year, from a peak of 74 percent in the second quarter of
2011, it said.  Casinos have sought to add more entertainment and family
shows to draw the middle-class Chinese tourists who make up the
mass market. While amateur gamblers play for smaller amounts,
they offer operators fatter margins. Casinos typically pay
commissions to middlemen who bring in the high rollers.  In the first quarter, Sands took the top spot in Macau’s
mass-market casino business, overtaking  SJM Holdings (880) , whose
founder, Stanley Ho, built Asia’s largest gambling empire by
catering to high rollers. Sands’ mass gambling revenue in Macau
jumped 63 percent to a record $863 million for the quarter,
while SJM’s rose 5 percent to about HK$6.22 billion ($802
million), earnings statements show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
