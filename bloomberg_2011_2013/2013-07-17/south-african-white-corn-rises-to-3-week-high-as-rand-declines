South African white corn futures
rose to the highest level in more than three weeks as the rand
weakened against the dollar, making imports of the grain more
expensive.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, rose 1.1 percent to 2,398 rand ($3,151) a metric ton,
the highest since June 21, by the midday close in Johannesburg.
The yellow variety for delivery in September, gained 0.7 percent
to 2,234 rand a ton.  The rand declined for the first time in four days amid
expectations that the South African Reserve Bank will leave
borrowing costs unchanged tomorrow as growth in  Africa ’s biggest
economy slows.  “With the rand having weakened, prices went up today,”
Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based
Senwes, said by phone.  South Africa, which is the continent’s largest producer of
corn, exported 86,946 tons of the yellow variety, including
84,537 tons to  Japan  in the week to July 12. It didn’t import
any of the grain during that time. Meal made from the white
variety is a staple food, while yellow corn is mainly used as
animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in December declined 0.3 percent to
3,360 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
