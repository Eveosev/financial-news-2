Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) , the third-biggest independent U.S. custody bank, fell the most in three
months after reporting second-quarter earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates.  Northern Trust, which is based in Chicago, declined 2.2
percent, the most since April 15, after reporting a 6.2 percent
increase in net income to $187.9 million, or 78 cents a share.
Results missed the 83-cent average estimate of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Higher-than-anticipated expenses, including compensation,
“lowered earnings per share by about 4 cents compared to the
market expectation,”  Marty Mosby , an analyst at Guggenheim
Securities LLC in Memphis, Tennessee, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Northern Trust, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Frederick H. Waddell, has trailed larger rivals Bank of New York
Mellon Corp. and  State Street Corp. (STT)  in cutting jobs amid record-low interest rates, announcing measures last year aimed at
lifting annual pretax income by $250 million by the end of this
year. The industry has suffered as the Federal Reserve kept its
benchmark lending rate near zero since December 2008, eroding
earnings from investments and securities lending.  Northern Trust fell $1.34 to close at $59.41 in New York
trading. The company had risen 21 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with the 27 percent gain by the Standard &
Poor’s 20-member  index  of asset managers and custody banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
