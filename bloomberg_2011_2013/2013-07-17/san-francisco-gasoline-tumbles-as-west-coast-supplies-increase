Gasoline on the spot market in San
Francisco fell to the lowest level against futures in four
months as supplies of the fuel on the West Coast rose.  Gasoline  inventories  in PADD 5 grew by 818,000 barrels to
29.1 million, the highest level since June 21, Energy
Information Administration data show. It was the first supply
increase in three weeks.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
weakened by 20.5 cents to a discount of 16 cents a gallon to
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 3:53 p.m. East
Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the
lowest level since March 12.  The fuel in Los Angeles weakened by 17.5 cents to a 6-cent
discount, the lowest level since March 21.  “The price tumble is in reaction to building stock
levels,” said Dave Hackett, president of energy consulting firm
Stillwater Associates in  Irvine , California.  California-blend diesel in San Francisco weakened by 2
cents to a premium of 1.5 cents a gallon above ultra-low-sulfur
diesel futures on the Nymex. The fuel in Los Angeles weakened by
2.63 cents to a 1-cent premium to futures.  Conventional, 84-octane gasoline  in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
weakened by 6 cents to a premium of 6 cents a gallon above Nymex
futures.  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP)  expects to resume
operations of its Trans Mountain pipeline at full capacity after
repairs on the line are finished at the end of the month.  The line, which can carry as much as 300,000 barrels of
crude and products a day from  Edmonton ,  Alberta , to  Vancouver 
and the Puget Sound area in Washington state, has been running
at 80 percent of its operating pressure since restarting
following a June 26 spill.  Low-sulfur diesel  in Portland weakened by 1 cent to 2.5
cents a gallon below ULSD futures on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
