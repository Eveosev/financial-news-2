Spot wholesale electricity prices
for  New York City  surged as air conditioner use increased during
a heat wave and supplies fell.  Hot and humid weather on the East Coast buoyed power prices
for a third day, topping $2,000 a megawatt-hour in afternoon
trading as imports from Ontario slowed. The supply drop came as
demand in the city headed toward a two-year high. The high
temperature in Manhattan rose to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35
Celsius), 11 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc.  Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED) , which owns the New York City
utility, put crews and spare transformers on standby to brace
for possible power failures this week. The state grid operator
activated demand-curtailment programs for a third day for New
York City and nearby regions.  “The air conditioners are cranked up high, and Con Ed in
New York has participating customers on reduced electrical
supplies due to near-record demand,”  John Kilduff , partner at
Again Capital LLC and editor of the Energy OverView newsletter
in New York, wrote today. “So far, so good on the grid holding
up.”  Spot electricity  for New York surged to $2,327.96 a
megawatt-hour after the hourly average had more than doubled to
$668.64 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 4 p.m. from a
day earlier, and traded at $518.06 in the 5 p.m. hour, grid data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. The day-ahead price for the hour
was $205. The  on-peak average  is up 91 percent at $324.96 from
yesterday’s full-day average, the most since Jan. 23.  Canadian Power  The state grid became a net exporter to Ontario as demand
ramped up with the afternoon heat, according to data from the
 New York  Independent System Operator Inc. The state grid was
exporting a net 84 megawatts of power to the Canadian province
at 3:50 p.m. after importing more than 1,000 megawatts from the
region at the start of the day.  New York City households and businesses may  consume  as much
as 11,178 megawatts during the 4 p.m. hour, the highest hourly
average since July 22, 2011. The New York ISO expects demand
statewide to peak at 33,400 megawatts, topping the 2013 high of
32,703 megawatts, according to an e-mailed statement.  The New York Power Authority, the largest U.S. public power
organization, activated a demand-reduction program for the
second straight day, asking the  Metropolitan Transportation
Authority  and other public units to reduce usage.  “We can’t do anything about the weather, but we can all do
something on the demand side to alleviate stress on the  power
grid  during these hot summer days,” Gil Quiniones, chief
executive officer of NYPA, said in an e-mailed statement.  PJM Prices  Spot power on the PJM Interconnection LLC network, from  New
Jersey  into  North Carolina  and  Illinois , and the six-state  New
England  grid reversed earlier losses as demand climbed. Supply
shortfalls in some areas and transmission bottlenecks had
contributed to higher prices at times yesterday.  PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which includes deliveries to
 Washington , gained $38.26, or 45 percent, to $123.72 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 4 p.m. from the same hour
yesterday. Power in the 5 p.m. hour rose 39 percent to $161.80.
Boston prices rose $30.74, or 21 percent, to $178.06 a megawatt-hour in the hour ended at 5 p.m..  The premium for New York City on-peak power versus the
Boston average widened to $204.10 a megawatt-hour from $66.23
yesterday. New York’s premium to  Public Service Enterprise Group
Inc. (PEG) ’s northern New Jersey territory on the neighboring PJM
grid, widened to $190.67 from $73 yesterday.  New England  ISO New England Inc. issued an alert for a third day,
warning of existing or potential abnormal conditions on the
grid. The grid operator predicted peak demand will increase to
27,000 megawatts from yesterday’s high of 26,210 megawatts.  PJM cut its peak-demand outlook for today to 154,187
megawatts for the hour ended at 4 p.m. from the previous
estimate of 155,743 megawatts during the 5 p.m. hour. Demand
rose to 152,761 yesterday.  Spot electricity in  Texas  slumped for the fourth time in
five days as demand fell below yesterday’s forecasts. Houston
power dropped $11.71, or 24 percent, to $37.30 a megawatt-hour
during the hour ended at 4 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
