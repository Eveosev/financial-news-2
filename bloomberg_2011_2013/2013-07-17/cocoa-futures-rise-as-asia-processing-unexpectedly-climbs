Cocoa rose to a four-week high as
bean processing in  Asia  unexpectedly increased in the second
quarter, signaling higher demand for the chocolate ingredient.
Coffee, orange juice and sugar advanced, while cotton fell.  The Singapore-based Cocoa Association of Asia said today
that processing rose 2 percent to 153,792 metric tons from a
year earlier. Analysts and traders expected a decrease. The
European Cocoa Association said on July 15 that grindings rose
6.1 percent in the second quarter.  “What’s driving this market now is the supply-and-demand
news,”  Boyd Cruel , Cruel, a senior analyst at Vision Financial
Markets in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “It’s moving
because of this morning’s report on processing in Asia.”  Cocoa for September delivery increased 0.8 percent to
$2,308 a metric ton at 11:28 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Earlier, the price reached $2,327, the highest for a most-active contract since June 13. Yesterday, the commodity jumped
3.1 percent, the most since Sept. 5.  Dry weather in the  Ivory Coast , the world’s top producer,
is also driving prices higher, Cruel said. The country is
entering its “mini dry season”, according to David Streit, a
meteorologist from Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda,
 Maryland .  Rain Shortfall  Most rainfall will be north of crop regions over the next
week, and growers are faced with a moisture deficit because of
low precipitation in the past few weeks, Streit said.
Temperatures may be as high as 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33
Celsius).  Exports from the Ivorian port of  San Pedro  tumbled 37
percent in June to 26,921 tons from a year earlier, according to
harbor data today.  North American processing figures will be released tomorrow
from the Washington-based  National Confectioners Association .  Arabica-coffee for September delivery climbed 1.2 percent
to $1.275 a pound on ICE. Earlier, the price reached $1.292, the
highest since June 12.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 1.7
percent to $1.45 a pound, the highest since June 20. The price
headed for the fourth straight increase.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery gained 0.9 percent
to 16.14 cents a pound. Yesterday, the price touched a three-year low of 15.93 cents. Through yesterday, the commodity
slumped 18 percent this year.  Cotton futures for December delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
84.09 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
