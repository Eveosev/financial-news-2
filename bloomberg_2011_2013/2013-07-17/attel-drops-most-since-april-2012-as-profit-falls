Mattel Inc. (MAT) , the largest U.S.
toymaker, dropped the most in 15 months after declining demand
for the aging Barbie doll line and increased costs to expand the
American Girl chain hurt second-quarter profit.  The shares fell 6.8 percent to $43.16 at the close in  New
York  for the biggest one-day decline since April 2012.  Chief Executive Officer Bryan G. Stockton has been spending
to expand the American Girl chain, which boosted sales 14
percent in the quarter, to help make up for declining interest
in the 54-year-old Barbie doll line. Barbie sales slid 12
percent in the quarter.  Second-quarter net income fell 24 percent to $73.3 million,
or 21 cents a share, from $96.2 million, or 28 cents, a year
earlier, the El Segundo, California-based company said today in
a statement. The average of 12 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was 32 cents. Sales rose 0.9 percent to $1.17 billion,
trailing the $1.22 billion average estimate.  Sales also dropped in the Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price
divisions and gained in the Other Girls business, which includes
the Monster High toys.  Other selling and administrative expenses in the period
rose 12 percent to $391.8 million as the company spent on the
American Girl expansion and upgrading its e-commerce technology.  Mattel has gained 18 percent this year, while the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Consumer Discretionary Index added 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
