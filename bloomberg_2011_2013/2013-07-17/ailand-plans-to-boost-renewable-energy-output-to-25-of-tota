Thailand  plans to increase
production of electricity from renewable sources to 25 percent
of total output over the next 10 years to reduce imports and
boost energy security, the Ministry of Energy said.  Power generation from renewables will jump by 51 percent to
13,927 megawatts by 2021, from a current target of 9,201
megawatts, the ministry said in a statement yesterday.  Under the new goal, approved by the National Energy Policy
Committee, output from biomass will be 4,800 megawatts; biogas
3,600 megawatts; solar 3,000 megawatts; wind 1,800 megawatts and
the balance will come from hydropower and waste, it said.  Thailand is providing incentives for renewable energy
projects to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, which account
for more than 80 percent of the nation’s energy consumption, the
 U.S. Energy Information Administration  said on its website.  Demco Pcl (DEMCO) , a builder of electricity networks, rose 7.1
percent to 9.05 in Bangkok as of 3:50 p.m. local time, poised
for its highest close in almost three weeks.  Gunkul Engineering (GUNKUL) 
Pcl, a power producer and engineering company, gained 4.6
percent. Both companies will benefit from the government’s plan
to diversify Thailand’s energy sources,  Maybank Kim Eng
