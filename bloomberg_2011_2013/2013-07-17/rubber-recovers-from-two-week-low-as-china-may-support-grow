Rubber rebounded from a two-week low
amid speculation  China  may take measures to support economic
growth, bolstering demand from the world’s largest consumer of
the commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in December on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange rose 4.3 percent to end at 244.7 yen a kilogram ($2,457
a metric ton) after falling to 234.6 yen yesterday, the lowest
settlement since June 27. The most-active contract has lost 19
percent this year.  Premier  Li Keqiang  told a forum of advisers and executives
yesterday that China will seek to keep economic growth,
employment and inflation within limits, signaling he won’t let
the rate of expansion slow too much. Gross domestic product rose
7.5 percent last quarter from a year earlier, putting at risk
the official full-year target for the same pace.  “The market corrected higher because it was oversold on
excessive concern about China slowing,” said Hideshi Matsunaga,
an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co. in Tokyo.  The International Rubber Study Group forecast a surplus
between 92,000 tons to 284,000 tons this year from a previous
forecast of 179,000 tons, according to senior economist Dock No.
Production may drop 0.1 percent to 11.3 million tons or increase
as much as 4.3 percent to 11.8 million tons, while demand may
grow around 2 percent to 5 percent to 11.2 million to 11.6
million tons, he said.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 3.6 percent to close at 18,260  yuan  ($2,977) a ton,
the highest level since June 19.  Thai rubber free-on-board remained unchanged at 78.85 baht
($2.54) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
