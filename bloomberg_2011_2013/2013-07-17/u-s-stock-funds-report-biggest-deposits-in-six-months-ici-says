Customers added the most cash to
American equity mutual funds since January after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s pledge to sustain monetary stimulus
sent  stocks  to record highs.  Mutual funds that invest in U.S. shares had $4.55 billion
of inflows during the week through July 10, ending seven
consecutive weeks of withdrawals, according to data from the
Washington-based  Investment Company Institute  released today.
About $8.1 billion was pulled from bond funds during the period,
marking a sixth week of outflows, the longest stretch since
December 2008.  Investors are returning to U.S. equities after an
unprecedented three rounds of government monetary stimulus
helped extend the  bull market  to a fifth year. They had favored
bonds in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis that erased
$11 trillion in American equity value. Bernanke said today that
the pace of bond purchases was not on a preset course and Bank
of America Corp. and Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. shares
advanced after earnings topped forecasts.  About $4.72 billion has been added to U.S. stock funds
since the end of 2012 after $426 billion in withdrawals from
2009 to 2012, ICI data show. At the same time, deposits to bond
funds totaled more than $1 trillion, including $30 billion this
year.  Benchmark 10-year Treasury  yields  posted the biggest drop
since June 2012 last week as Bernanke called for “highly
accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future.”
Treasuries have lost 2.6 percent this year, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes, amid speculation that the Fed may
begin to slow asset buying.  Individual investors usually own stocks through mutual
funds, with 44 percent of households holding assets in the funds
last year, according to the 2013 ICI Fact book.  To contact the reporter on this story:
