The cost of insuring Japanese
corporate bonds from non-payment increased, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index gained 1 basis point to 92
basis points as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The index is on track for its highest close since July 12,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 137.5 basis points
as of 8:32 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge has ranged from 136.6 basis
points to 163 basis points this month, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 126 basis points as of 10:29 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The index has ranged from 125.5 to
139.8 this month, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
