Palm oil advanced for the first time
in six days after a drop to a seven-month low yesterday
attracted buyers of the world’s most consumed cooking oil.  The contract for October delivery, with the biggest volume,
gained as much as 2 percent to 2,273 ringgit ($713) a metric ton
on the Bursa  Malaysia  Derivatives, and was at 2,270 ringgit at
12:19 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur . The September-delivery contract fell
yesterday to the lowest price at close for most-active futures
since Dec. 13. Palm for local physical delivery in August was at
2,285 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Concerns over  China ’s economic slowdown and a bumper U.S.
soybean harvest have led to speculation demand for palm would
slow, driving prices down about 6.5 percent in the past five
days. Palm oil fundamentals have improved and prices are poised
to trade higher in the coming months, wrote Ong Chee Ting,
analyst at Maybank Investment Bank Bhd., in a report today.  “Low prices may attract demand again,” said Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. “The
drop has factored in almost all of the negative news, which
includes the higher soybean production estimate by the USDA and
weak exports for the first 15 days. It’s a technical rebound
because it’s oversold, the RSI is below 30.”  Palm oil ’s 14-day relative strength index fell below 30 on
July 15 and yesterday, a technical signal to some analysts that
an asset’s price has fallen too fast and is poised to increase.  Exports from Malaysia, the largest producer after
 Indonesia , fell 24 percent to 536,391 tons in the first 15 days
of July from the same period in June, surveyor SGS (Malaysia)
Sdn. said on July 15.  Refined palm oil for January delivery climbed 0.2 percent
to 5,648 yuan ($921) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
after closing at the lowest price for the most-active contract
since July 2009 yesterday, while  soybean oil  for delivery in the
same month advanced 1.1 percent to 7,284  yuan .  Soybean oil for delivery in December climbed 0.7 percent to
45.59 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while
soybeans for delivery in November gained 0.3 percent to $12.905
a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
