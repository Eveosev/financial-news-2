Property transactions in  Japan 
jumped 50 percent in the first half of 2013, heading for the
most in five years, amid efforts by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to
boost the economy, according to  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)   Sales of offices, warehouses and retail space rose to $20.9
billion in the first six months from the same period a year
earlier, according to an e-mailed statement from the broker.
That compares with a 20 percent drop in sales in China, a 10
percent increase in Australia and 43 percent gain in  Germany , it
said.  Abe’s pledge to end 15 years of deflation and the Bank of
Japan’s unprecedented monetary easing policy have lifted
business and  consumer confidence  in the world’s third-largest
economy. The approach, dubbed Abenomics, has helped boost
property transactions in Japan.  Deals in Japan will rise to as much as 3.5 trillion yen
($35 billion) this year, the most since 2008, according to
Takeshi Akagi, a director in Tokyo for the Chicago-based broker.  Elsewhere in the world, transactions in the U.K. rose 4
percent in the first half, while property deals in France gained
6 percent, the statement showed.  J-REITs alone will probably acquire a record 2.5 trillion
yen of properties this year by raising about 900 billion yen
through public offerings, said  Yoji Otani , a Tokyo-based analyst
at Deutsche Bank AG.  The Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index has gained 25 percent
so far this year, extending its 34 percent gain in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
