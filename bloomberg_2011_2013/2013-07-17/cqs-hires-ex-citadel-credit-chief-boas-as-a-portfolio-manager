Chris Boas, a former global head of
credit in Citadel LLC’s securities unit, joined hedge-fund firm
CQS U.K. LLP after he canceled plans for his own hedge fund.  He will be a senior portfolio manager at London-based CQS,
the $12.2 billion firm founded by  Michael Hintze , Michael Rummel, a spokesman, said by telephone today. Boas will manage
investments that bet on rising and falling prices in credit
instruments such as bonds and derivatives. He didn’t respond to
two e-mails seeking comment.  Boas, 41, left Chicago-based Citadel in 2011 and intended
to start trading in his Longwood Credit Partners LLP hedge fund
in the first quarter of this year. He canceled those plans after
struggling to raise adequate capital for the fund, Andrew Honnor, a spokesman for the firm, said on June 11.  He started at CQS on July 11, according to filings with the
U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. His hiring was reported
earlier today by eFinancialNews.  To contact the reporter on this story:
