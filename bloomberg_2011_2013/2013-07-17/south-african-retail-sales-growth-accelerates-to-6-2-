South African  retail-sales  growth
accelerated to a nine-month high of 6.2 percent in May, as
consumers bought more clothing, shoes and textiles, the
statistics office said.  The figure compared with a revised 2 percent in April,
Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said on its website
today. The  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of 10
economists was for expansion of 2.4 percent. Sales rose 2.2
percent in the month.  “We saw the same spike in May last year,” Merina
Willemse, an economist at Efficient Group, a Pretoria-based
advisory company, said in a phone interview. “There could be a
little bit of seasonality coming into play. If you take the
cumulative average for the year, we are still growing slower
than last year. Consumers are still not out of the woods.”  South Africa ’s central bank will tomorrow keep its
benchmark  lending  rate at 5 percent, the lowest level in more
than 30 years, according to all 18 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The bank is caught between the threat of a weak rand
driving up inflation and poor economic growth. The economy grew
at its slowest pace since a 2009 recession in the first quarter.  Sales of clothing, footwear, textiles and leather goods
rose an annual 13 percent, while sales at general dealers
advanced 5.9 percent the statistics office said.  The rand traded at 9.9064 per dollar at 1:42 p.m. in
Johannesburg, little changed from before the release of the
data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
