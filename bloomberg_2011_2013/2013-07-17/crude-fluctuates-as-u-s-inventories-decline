West  Texas  Intermediate crude gained
after a government report showed U.S. inventories decreased more
than expected as refineries boosted fuel production.  Prices rose 0.5 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said  stockpiles  dropped 6.9 million barrels to
367 million in the seven days ended July 12. Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg forecast a decline of 2 million. Stockpiles of
gasoline and diesel increased as refineries operated at the
highest rate in a year.  “The report is supportive for crude prices,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. “You’ll see more crude being refined
into product. The data may dampen gasoline prices.”  WTI for August delivery climbed 48 cents to settle at
$106.48 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The volume
of all futures traded was 11 percent above the 100-day average
at 2:52 p.m. The futures have rallied 10 percent in July, headed
for the biggest monthly gain since October 2011.  Brent for September settlement advanced 47 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $108.61 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Volume was 26 percent below the 100-day average.
Brent’s premium over WTI narrowed to $2.26.  Biggest Decrease  Crude stockpiles decreased for a third week to the lowest
level since Jan. 18, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm. Stockpiles surged to 397.6 million
on May 24, the most since 1931.  “There was such a high level of crude oil inventories that
we can actually draw down inventories to much lower levels
without having an impact on day-to-day refining operations,”
said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in
New York. “Nobody is going to be cutting crude runs because
they draw inventories too much.”  The refinery operation  rate  increased to 92.8 percent, up
0.4 percentage point from the prior week and the highest level
since July 20. Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for WTI futures, dropped 882,000 barrels to 46.1 million, the
lowest level since Nov. 30.  “Because demand from refiners is so strong, they are just
not putting a lot of crude in storage,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gasoline Demand  Gasoline consumption decreased 570,000 barrels a day, or
6.1 percent, to 8.73 million, the biggest decline since Jan. 7,
2005. Supplies rose 3.06 million barrels to 224.1 million. They
were expected to fall 1.5 million.  Distillate fuels, which include diesel and heating oil,
rose 3.87 million barrels to 127.7 million. Analysts expected a
gain of 1.5 million. Demand slipped 0.7 percent to 3.82 million
barrels a day, the least since May 31.  “Demand is still weak,” Evans said. “Product inventories
rose firmly.”  Gasoline futures dropped 2.42 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$3.1101 a gallon on the Nymex. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel rose 2.43
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.0712.  Gains in domestic crude production and imports helped boost
inventories. Output climbed for a fourth week to 7.49 million
barrels a day on July 12, the most since December 1990. Crude
imports climbed 180,000 barrels a day to 7.71 million.  “We are going to continue to see increases in production
but the rate of increase in general is likely to slow,”
Schenker said.  Rising Production  A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies in shale
formations in states including  North Dakota , Oklahoma and Texas.
Rising oil production helped the U.S. meet 89 percent of its own
energy needs in March, the highest monthly rate since April
1986, according to the EIA.  Oil fluctuated most of the day after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told the House Financial Services
Committee that the central bank’s asset purchases “are by no
means on a preset course.” He said they could be reduced more
quickly or expanded as economic conditions warrant.  “The big fear in the market is that the Fed pulls back on
its stimulus,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “If there is any
kind of indication that the Fed will begin to cut back on their
stimulus, that will create quite a headwind in the market.”  The Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against six
other major currencies, rose as much as 0.5 percent. A stronger
dollar reduces the appeal of investing in oil.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
September was 20.7 percent, compared with 21.7 percent
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 594,126
contracts as of 2:57 p.m. It totaled 634,093 contracts
yesterday, 3.4 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.88 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
