Krishna Guha, the top spokesman for
the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York  and for its president
William C. Dudley, will step down from his post today and leave
the bank Sept. 6, the bank said today in a release.  “He will step down from his current position immediately,
and serve as a senior adviser to President Dudley until his last
day in the bank,” the  New York  Fed said today in a statement.
Guha was an executive vice president at the regional bank.  The New York Fed didn’t provide a reason for his departure.
The search process for Guha’s replacement will include a review
of internal and external candidates, according to the statement.  -- Editors: Brendan Murray, James Tyson  To contact the reporter on this story:
