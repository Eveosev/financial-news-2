Apple Inc. (AAPL)  may delay the
introduction of the iPhone 5S until the end of the year after
the design was changed to feature a bigger 4.3-inch retina
display screen, the Commercial Times reported.  The company previously scheduled the release for September
or October, the Taiwanese newspaper reported, citing
unidentified people in the semiconductor industry. Takashi Takebayashi, a spokesman for Apple in Tokyo, wasn’t immediately
available to comment to  Bloomberg News .  Apple, the world’s largest technology company, hasn’t
released a new handset since last year’s iPhone 5. While the
Cupertino, California-based company’s device is the top-selling
smartphone,  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  has become the leading
provider overall with a variety of products at different prices.  A cheaper version of the Apple iPhone is expected by the
end of the third quarter after chips for the new model started
shipment in June, the newspaper said.  Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (2330)  may deliver chips for the iPhone 5S in August,
according the the report.  Suppliers to Apple fell after the report, with  Pegatron
Corp. (4938)  slumping 7 percent to NT$47.55 as of 12:33 p.m. in Taipei.
TPK Holding Co. dropped 3.2 percent to NT$399.  Elizabeth Sun, a spokeswoman for TSMC, didn’t immediately
return two calls seeking comment on the report. Pegatron Chief
Financial Officer Charles Lin and TPK CFO Freddie Liu didn’t
immediately return calls from Bloomberg News  To contact the reporter on this story:
