Eugene Island crude produced in the
 Gulf of Mexico  strengthened after Royal Dutch Shell Plc said it
is doing work that will shut in production at the nearby Auger
platform until the fourth quarter of 2013.  Eugene Island crude’s premium widened by $1.25 to $5 a
barrel over West Texas Intermediate at 12:22 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Work to shut in the
Auger platform, which produces 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent
a day, began this week, said Kayla Macke, a Shell spokeswoman,
by phone today.  “Besides the platform, you’re probably seeing some
attendant short-covering,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice
president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “There’s probably
got to be some correction on some of these offshore crudes,
because their differentials to WTI have really come off.”  The premiums for Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana
Sweet over WTI each gained 50 cents to $6.40 a barrel and $5.40
a barrel, respectively. Bonito Sour strengthened by 45 cents to
$5 over WTI.  Poseidon strengthened against WTI, narrowing its discount
70 cents to 90 cents a barrel, and Mars Blend strengthened 30
cents, to a 30-cent-a-barrel discount to WTI. Southern Green
Canyon rose 30 cents a barrel to a $1.50 discount.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, rose $1 a
barrel to $5 over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
