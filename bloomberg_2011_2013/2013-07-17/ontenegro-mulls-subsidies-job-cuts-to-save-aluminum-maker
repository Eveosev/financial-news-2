Montenegro may try to save its sole
aluminum maker Kombinat Aluminijuma Podgorica AD, or KAP, by
cutting its workforce by 58 percent and subsidizing a third of
the electricity costs of the unprofitable plant, the Balkan
country’s Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said.  The plan, which needs to be approved by parliament, would
allow KAP to keep output at 50,000 tons a year, or less than
half its capacity, Djukanovic said in a statement on the
government’s website.  A  court  in the capital, Podgorica, started bankruptcy
proceedings against KAP on July 8, after it failed to pay 61
million euros ($80 million) in electricity bills, while  VTB Bank
OJSC (VTBR)  and OTP Bank Plc activated state guarantees on KAP loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
