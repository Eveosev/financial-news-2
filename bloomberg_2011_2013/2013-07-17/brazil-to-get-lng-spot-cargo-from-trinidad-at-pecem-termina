Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a spot
cargo from Trinidad & Tobago, shipping data show.  The Bilbao Knutsen, with a capacity of about 135,000 cubic
meters, is on its way to Pecem, according to transmissions
captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. Rio de Janeiro-based
Petroleo Brasileiro, known as Petrobras, has a floating
regasification terminal at the port in northeastern Brazil.  The vessel sailed from Atlantic LNG Co.’s Point Fortin
terminal, where it loaded the supercooled natural gas and
departed on July 3.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts with
Trinidad & Tobago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Petrobras will import as many as 60 cargoes this year, up from
56 in 2012, the company said June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
