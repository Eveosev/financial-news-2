Ibovespa  futures  advanced, reversing
an earlier decline, after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said bond purchases that bolstered emerging-market
assets “are by no means on a preset course.”  Localiza Rent a Car SA ,  Latin America ’s biggest car-rental
company, may move after posting second-quarter earnings that
exceeded analysts’ estimates. Consumer-health products
manufacturer  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3)  may be active after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. raised its recommendation to buy.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August rose 1
percent to 47,195 at 9:51 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real rose 0.9
percent to 2.2345 per dollar.  Bernanke said today in prepared testimony before the House
Financial Services Committee that asset purchases could be
reduced more quickly or expanded as economic conditions warrant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
