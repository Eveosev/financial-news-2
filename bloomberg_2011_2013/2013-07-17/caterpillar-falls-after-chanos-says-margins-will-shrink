Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the largest maker
of construction and mining equipment, fell after short seller
 Jim Chanos  said the company is being hurt by the slowdown in
commodities demand.  The shares  dropped  2.2 percent to $86.26 at 12:47 p.m. in
New York. Earlier they declined 2.6 percent, the most intraday
since June 24.  Caterpillar “is tied to the wrong products at the wrong
time in the cycle,” Chanos said today in a speech at the CNBC
Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference in New York.
“Profit margins will revert with viciousness in the next 10
years.”  Chanos, the president and founder of Kynikos Associates
Ltd., said he’s shorting the stock and the company is “being
aggressive with their acquisitional accounting.”  Jim Dugan , a spokesman for Peoria, Illinois-based
Caterpillar, declined to comment on Chanos’s statements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
