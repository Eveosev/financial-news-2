Greek police banned public
gatherings and marches in much of central  Athens  tomorrow when
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is due to visit the
city.  The ban will run from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. for security reasons
and to regulate traffic, according to a  statement  on the police
force website. A similar ban will be imposed on the route from
the Athens International Airport to the city center.  Similar restrictions were imposed during a visit by German
Chancellor Angela Merkel in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
