  Beijing Enterprises Water Group
Ltd. (371) , a developer of water-treatment systems, plans to buy two
project units from Standard Water Ltd. for 1.35 billion  yuan 
($220 million) to expand further in China.  The agreement involves 36 water projects in China, Beijing
Enterprises said today in a Hong Kong exchange filing. Forty to
60 percent of the deal will be paid by issuing shares at HK$2.82
apiece, and the remainder in cash.  Standard Water, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, is
mainly engaged in sewage treatment. Beijing Enterprises rose 0.7
percent to close at HK$3.10 in Hong Kong trading today, boosting
gains this year to 55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
