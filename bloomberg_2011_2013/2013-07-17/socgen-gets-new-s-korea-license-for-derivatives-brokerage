Societe Generale SA (GLE)  said it won
regulatory approval in South Korea to begin operations at a new
local unit as it seeks to expand its derivatives and brokerage
businesses in the country.  The Paris-based bank obtained a license from the country’s
financial regulator to trade securities including over-the-counter derivatives and offer financial-investment brokerage
services under SG Securities Korea Co., Societe Generale said in
a statement today. Currently, the Seoul branch of the lender’s
Hong Kong unit is allowed to operate some of the businesses in
the country, according to the statement.  Societe Generale, which said it has invested 200 billion
won ($178 million) in South Korea since 2011, is reorganizing
its operations in the country, as local sales of structured
notes for individual investors have surged. The new unit will
take over the bank’s existing businesses in the nation, and new
resources will be added, according to the statement.  Revamped local operations will allow the bank to be a
“fully fledged provider of financial services for its Korean
clients” including structured products, Inhwan Oh, head of SG
Securities Korea, said in the statement.  Issuance of structured notes for individual investors
soared 54 percent to a record 70 trillion won last year,
according to data from Korea Financial Investment Association.
Such securities are created by bundling derivatives with debt
instruments to generate returns tied to the underlying assets,
from equities to currencies to commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
