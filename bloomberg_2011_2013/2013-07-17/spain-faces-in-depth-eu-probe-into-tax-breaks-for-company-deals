Spain  faces an in-depth
investigation by the European Union into whether changes made to
a tax-break system for companies acquiring shares in foreign
companies is in line with EU rules.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive agency, said it
opened an in-depth probe after its preliminary view that the
changed system involves state aid, because “Spain is unduly
enlarging the application of an illegal and incompatible
scheme,” according to a statement in Brussels today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
