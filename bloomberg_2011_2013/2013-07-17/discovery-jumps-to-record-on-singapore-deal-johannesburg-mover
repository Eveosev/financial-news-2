Discovery Ltd. (DSY) , South Africa’s
largest medical-insurance provider, rose to a record after
saying its wellness-based life-insurance model Vitality started
in Singapore through a joint venture with  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)   The stock jumped 6.6 percent, the most since Sept. 2008, to
92 rand at the close in Johannesburg, the highest since at least
October 1999, when Bloomberg began compiling the data. About 1.6
million shares were traded, or 111 percent of the three-month
daily average. Discovery was the second-best performer on the
166-member FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share Index today.  “With the way the stock is trading today, up 6 percent, it
shows at least some investors are optimistic about the Vitality
model roll-out in Singapore,” Ryan Wibberley, the head of
equity dealing for frontier and emerging markets at Investec
Asset Management, said by phone from  Cape Town .  Discovery, 25 percent owned by investment holding company
 RMI Holdings Ltd. (RMI) , expects to invest the equivalent of less than
5 percent of pretax profit into the venture, the company said in
a regulatory filing today. The model, called AIA Vitality,
provides rewards for participating in wellness programs such as
increasing fitness and healthy eating.  The venture provides an opportunity for Discovery to expand
its footprint in the Asia-Pacific market, Chief Executive
Officer Adrian Gore said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
