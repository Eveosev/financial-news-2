Gasoline retreated from a four-month
high as U.S. inventories increased unexpectedly and demand for
the motor fuel declined.  Futures retreated as the Energy Information Administration
reported that  gasoline supplies  rose 3.06 million barrels last
week to 224.1 million. A Bloomberg survey projected a drop of
1.5 million barrels. Demand sank 6.1 percent from a week
earlier, while over the past four weeks it was 2.3 percent above
a year ago.  “A big product build in early July is not positive,” said
David Pursell, a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
LLC in Houston. “The four-week demand numbers are still
positive but the leading-edge numbers are down.”  August-delivery gasoline fell 2.42 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to settle at $3.1101 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Trading volume was 28 percent above the 100-day
average at 3:31 p.m.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI fell $1.50 to $24.14 a
barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent fell $1.10 to $18.99.  Supplies on the Gulf Coast, home to 45 percent of U.S.
refining capacity, rose 2.06 million barrels to 78.2 million,
the highest level in five months, according to EIA data.  The total inventory increase came as  refiners processed  a
seasonal record amount of crude and other feedstocks last week.
 Gasoline output  fell 5.6 percent to 9.05 million barrels a day,
the lowest rate in seven weeks, as refiners shut process units
for unplanned outages. Valero Energy Corp. shut a fluid
catalytic cracker last week at its refinery in Port Arthur,
 Texas , and the unit remains closed for repairs.  Refinery Outages  Before today, gasoline futures had jumped 14 percent in
July as refineries from Philadelphia to Texas shut units and as
West Texas Intermediate crude surged above $100 a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose a ninth consecutive
time, gaining 2.2 cents to $3.657 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website. That’s the highest level
since May 22.  “Most of us were looking for draws in gasoline,” said
 Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in
New York. “I think that next week you will see a sharp draw.
Wholesalers and consumers are going to want to get ahead of
these price increases.”  Ultra-low sulfur diesel rose as Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke in prepared testimony to the House Financial
Services Committee said the central bank’s asset purchases “are
by no means on a present course” and could be reduced or
expanded as economic conditions warrant. His statements eased
concern that central-bank stimulus would be tapered off soon.  No Timetable  “There is no timetable,” Pursell said.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for August delivery rose 2.43
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.0712 a gallon, the highest
settlement since April 2. Trading volume was 3.3 percent above
the 100-day average.  Distillate  inventories  rose 3.87 million barrels to 127.7
million, the highest level since Feb. 1, the EIA said.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
widened 54 cents to $22.51 a barrel. The  premium over Brent 
increased 55 cents to $20.36.  To contact the reporter on this story:
