Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said about 2 percentage points of the unemployment rate
is related to weak demand in the economy, in response to a
question during his semiannual testimony before the House
Financial Services Committee.  “Probably about 2 percentage points or so -- say the
difference between 7.6 and 5.6 is cyclical,” Bernanke said in
response to a question from  Spencer Bachus , an Alabama
Republican. The jobless rate last month was 7.6 percent.  “We don’t see much evidence that the structural component
of unemployment has increased very much during this period,”
Bernanke said. “It is something we have been worried about
because with people unemployed for a year, two years, or three
years, they lose their skills, they lose their attachment to the
labor market, and the concern is they will become
unemployable.”  “So far it still appears to us that we, the country, can
obtain an  unemployment rate  somewhere in the” 5 percent range,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
