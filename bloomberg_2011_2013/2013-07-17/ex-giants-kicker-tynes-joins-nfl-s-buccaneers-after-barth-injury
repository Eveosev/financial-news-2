The  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  signed
former New York Giants kicker  Lawrence Tynes  to replace Connor Barth, who will miss the National Football League season with a
torn right Achilles tendon.  Tynes, 35, spent the past six seasons with the Giants and
won two  Super Bowl  titles. He’s made 81.5 percent of his field
goal attempts over his nine-year NFL career and hit overtime
kicks that won conference championship games ahead of the Super
Bowl following the 2007 and 2011 seasons.  Tynes wasn’t re-signed by the Giants as an unrestricted
free agent even though his 145 points last season ranked second
in the NFL and his 33 field goals-made were tied for second-most
in the league. Both were career highs.  “We are disappointed to lose a productive player like
Connor, but are very fortunate to be able to sign an experienced
kicker at this time of year,” Buccaneers General Manager Mark
Dominik said in an e-mailed statement.  The Buccaneers didn’t disclose financial terms of Tynes’s
one-year contract. Dominik said Tynes had “standing
opportunities” with other NFL teams, without being specific.  The 27-year-old Barth, who made 84.3 percent of his field
goals for  Tampa Bay  over the past four seasons, had surgery to
repair his Achilles two days ago after suffering the injury last
week in his hometown of Wilmington, North Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
