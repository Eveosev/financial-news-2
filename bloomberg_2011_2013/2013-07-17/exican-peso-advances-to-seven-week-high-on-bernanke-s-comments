Mexico ’s peso rose to its highest
level in seven weeks as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
damped investor concern that a reduction in stimulus was
imminent and after U.S. housing starts fell.  The currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 12.5491 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:21 a.m. in Mexico City, the strongest level on a
closing basis since May 27. The peso extended its advance this
year to 2.4 percent, the only gain among 16 major dollar
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. Peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on the securities maturing in 2024 down four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.72 percent.  Mexico’s peso reversed earlier losses and rallied as
Bernanke said in comments prepared for congressional testimony
that the central bank’s asset purchases “are by no means on a
preset course” and could be reduced more quickly or expanded as
economic conditions warrant.  “It’s all about Bernanke’s testimony,” Roberto Galvan, a
currency trader at Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA. “All the data
came out very bad so this indicates that they aren’t going to
withdraw stimulus.”  Work began in the U.S. on 836,000 houses at an annualized
rate last month, the least since August 2012 and down 9.9
percent from a revised 928,000 pace in May, figures from the
Commerce Department showed today in  Washington . Mexico’s
northern neighbor is its biggest trading partner.  Mexico’s currency tumbled 2.6 percent on June 19, when
Bernanke said the U.S. central bank may begin to slow its
$85 billion in monthly bond purchases this year and end them in
2014 if economic growth meets policy makers’ goals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
