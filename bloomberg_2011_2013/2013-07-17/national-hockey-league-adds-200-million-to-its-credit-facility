The National Hockey League increased
its credit facility to $600 million, up $200 million from the
previous amount, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The league also received a better rate on the agreement
with  Citigroup Inc. (C) , which was completed last month. The new
facility is priced at the London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, plus 250 basis points. The previous facility was $400
million at Libor plus 300 basis points.  Professional sports leagues create loan pools by using
collateral such as national broadcast contracts to secure credit
at better terms than most teams could individually. The NHL
locked out players at the start of last season in a collective
bargaining dispute and played a 48-game campaign starting in
January.  NHL spokesman Frank Brown declined in an e-mail to comment
on whether the league increased its credit facility. Anthony Di
Santi, managing director at Citi’s sports finance and advisory
group, in a statement said the facility was “well received by
the market, which is a reflection of the overall financial
strength of the league.”  Libor is the rate banks say they charge on loans to each
other.  To contact the reporters on this story:
