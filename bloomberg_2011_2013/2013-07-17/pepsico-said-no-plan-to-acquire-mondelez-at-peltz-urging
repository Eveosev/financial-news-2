PepsiCo Inc. doesn’t plan to heed a
proposal by Trian Fund Management LP’s  Nelson Peltz , who is
urging the soft-drink maker to purchase  Mondelez International
Inc. (MDLZ) , according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  PepsiCo also is unlikely to split its global beverage
business from its global snacks business, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the company’s dealmaking is
handled privately.  Buying Mondelez would be risky for PepsiCo shareholders
because of Mondelez’s underperformance and reliance on slow
growth Western European markets, this person said. PepsiCo,
based in Purchase, New York, earlier had said, “we have a
strong growth strategy and structure in place, and our results
to date and returns to our shareholders prove that we are a high
performing company and our strategy is working. We continue to
make significant progress against our strategic priorities and
are focused on delivering results and driving long-term
 shareholder value .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
