AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.’s (ANG)  bond yields
rose to a record after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the third-biggest
bullion producer’s rating to junk because of a record three-month drop in the price of the metal in the second quarter.  Yields on the Johannesburg-based company’s dollar bonds due
in April 2020 surged 31 basis points to 7.63 percent by 5:05
p.m. in the city. Rates on AngloGold’s debt maturing in August
2022, also denominated in the U.S. currency, climbed 40 basis
points, or 0.40 percentage point, to 7.75 percent.  The company’s long-term issuer credit assessment was cut
one step to BB+, S&P’s highest non-investment grade, with a
stable outlook, the ratings company said in an e-mailed
statement. The downgrade follows Moody’s Investors Service
Ltd.’s decision on July 12 to reduce  AngloGold’s rating  by one
level to its lowest investment grade.  “The recent severe drop in the gold price exposes South
African gold miner  AngloGold Ashanti ,” S&P said in the
statement. “We have revised downward our assessment of
AngloGold’s financial risk profile.”  AngloGold on July 15 said it plans to write down its assets
and stockpiles by as much as $2.6 billion, spurred by gold’s 23
percent plunge this year. The company, which seeks to sell
dollar bonds this year, is also facing demands by South African
unions for wages to be more than doubled for entry-level
workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
