Trian Fund Management LP’s Nelson
Peltz said he wants  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  to buy Mondelez International
Inc. for $35 to $38 a share in an all-stock deal.  “Pepsi is at a crossroads at this time,” with a cash
business and a growth business, Peltz, Trian’s chief executive
officer, said today at the CNBC Institutional Investor
Delivering Alpha Conference in New York. Pepsi's CEO “inherited a
structure that we don’t think works anymore,” he said.  If Pepsi isn’t interested in buying Mondelez, plan B should
be to separate beverages from the Frito business, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
