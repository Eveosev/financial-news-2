Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,  Australia â€™s
second-biggest oil producer, said second-quarter sales declined
6 percent after an unplanned shutdown at its Pluto liquefied
natural gas project.  Revenue fell to $1.35 billion from $1.43 billion a year
earlier, the Perth-based company said today in a statement. That
compares with a median estimate of $1.38 billion from three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Production was 20 million barrels of oil equivalent,
compared with 20.1 million barrels a year earlier. The median
estimate from three analysts was 21.2 million barrels.  Woodside earlier this month cut its full-year production
forecast after the shutdown caused a temporary interruption at
the A$15 billion ($13.9 billion) Pluto project in  Western
Australia . Output for 2013 is expected at 85 million barrels of
oil equivalent to 89 million barrels, down from a previous
forecast of 88 million barrels to 94 million barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
