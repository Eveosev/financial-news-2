The German government dismissed a
Bild newspaper report that it may have known about the Prism
program, saying that a NATO network used in  Afghanistan  was
“not identical” with the National Security Agency’s program.  Bild earlier said the German military knew about the
activities, citing field-intelligence documents that revealed a
program called Prism.  The network cited by Bild and the recently disclosed NSA
data gathering operation aren’t the same, said government
spokesman Steffen Seibert, citing the head of  Germany ’s BND
foreign intelligence agency.  “This is a NATO/ISAF program, not identical with the Prism
program of the NSA,” Seibert said today in Berlin. He
reiterated that Germany has asked the U.S. for information about
the NSA program.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government has been criticized
for its handling of the U.S. surveillance scandal, with the
opposition saying the administration should have known more
about the NSA’s activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
