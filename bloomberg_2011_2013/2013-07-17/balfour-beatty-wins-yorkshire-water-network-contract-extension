Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY) , the biggest
construction company in Britain, was awarded a five-year
extension to its water-network contract with Yorkshire Water
that’s valued at 70 million pounds ($107 million).  The London-based infrastructure group, which last week said
a newly created venture will begin working in  Australia  with
that country’s largest water utility, Sydney Water, generates
half of its revenue in Britain. Today’s contract is to upgrade
the clean-water network in South and West Yorkshire, including
replacing mains and re-lining older ones, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
