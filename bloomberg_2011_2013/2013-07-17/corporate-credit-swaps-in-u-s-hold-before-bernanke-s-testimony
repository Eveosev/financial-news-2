A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk was little changed as investors await Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s semi-annual testimony to Congress on
monetary policy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
0.2 basis point to a mid-price of 78.1 basis points at 7:52 a.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are looking for indications from the central-bank
chairman about when policy makers will begin reducing $85
billion of monthly bond purchases. Bernanke’s statement to the
House Financial Services Committee is set for release at 8:30
a.m. in Washington and the hearing begins at 10 a.m.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
