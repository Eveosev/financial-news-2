Members of Italy’s Ligresti family,
who once controlled insurer  Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA) , were arrested
today on charges of false accounting and market manipulation,
police said.  The family’s patriarch, Salvatore Ligresti, and his two
daughters, were among seven people taken into custody by Italy’s
financial police, according to an e-mailed statement from its
Turin office. They are accused of misleading at least 12,000
investors by concealing 600 million euros ($789 million) of
losses at Fondiaria-SAI in its 2010 accounts.  Ligresti is under house arrest, while his daughters Giulia
Maria and Jonella are being detained at an undisclosed jail,
police said. Three former Fondiaria executives, Emanuele
Erbetta, Antonio Talarico and Fausto Marchionni also have been
charged. An arrest warrant was issued for Gioacchino Paolo
Ligresti, one of Salvatore Ligresti’s sons, is in  Switzerland ,
police said.  Gian Luigi Tizzoni, a defense attorney for the Ligrestis,
wasn’t immediately available to comment on the case.  According to the police statement, the Ligrestis
underestimated the company’s reserves for outstanding insurance
claims, allowing it to distribute 253 million euros of earnings
to the family holding company  Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF) , instead
of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
