Copper declined after large
producers reported higher-than-expected output, raising the
possibility of excess supply.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.4 percent to $6,967.75 a metric ton,
and was at $6,982 as of 10:07 a.m. in  Shanghai . Aluminum, lead,
nickel and zinc also retreated.  BHP Billiton Ltd., world’s third largest producer of the
metal, said copper output for the three months ended June was
333,200 tons, beating the median estimate of 322,000 tons. Rio
Tinto Group said the mined copper output gained 10 percent in
the quarter to 146,200 tons. That compared with a median
estimate of 115,000 tons.  “Because the general expectation is rising supplies and a
surplus market this year, copper prices will continue to be
weighed down unless there’s unexpected strong positive news,”
said Wang Na, an analyst at Guolian Futures Co. “Bernanke’s
comments today may offer short-term direction.”  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is scheduled to
testify before a congressional committee, after saying last week
that “highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable
future is what’s needed.”  Copper for delivery in September on the Comex dropped 0.5
percent to $3.1695 a pound. Metal for delivery in November on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange was little changed at 50,230  yuan 
($8,191) a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
