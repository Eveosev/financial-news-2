Threshold Power Trust is seeking
about C$145 million ($140 million) in a Canadian initial public
offering to invest in U.S. wind projects, according to two
people with direct knowledge of the transaction.  Threshold Power will sell trust units for C$10 each and use
the money to buy stakes in nine wind-power projects from a
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  affiliate, KEF Equity Investment Corp. and
 Energias de Portugal SA ’s EDP Renewables North America unit for
$120 million, according to a July 4 regulatory filing. The sale
will be priced in the first week of August, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because terms aren’t public.  The trust will trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange after
the sale is completed, according to the filing. A telephone
message left with Threshold Power Chief Executive Officer Susan Nickey at her Chicago office to confirm the price wasn’t
immediately returned.  Threshold Power adopted a corporate structure known as a
foreign-asset income trust, which distributes most of its  cash
flow  to investors in monthly payouts and has all of its assets
outside Canada. Other companies that used this structure include
Argent Energy Trust, the Calgary-based firm that raised C$212.3
million in an IPO last year, as well as Parallel Energy Trust
and Eagle Energy Trust.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of  Nova Scotia ,
 National Bank of Canada  and Stifel Nicolaus Canada Inc. are
leading the sale, the Toronto-based trust said in a July 5
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
