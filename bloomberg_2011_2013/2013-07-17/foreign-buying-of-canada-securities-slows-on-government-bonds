Foreigners bought Canadian
securities at a reduced pace in May from a month earlier as they
sold government bonds and curbed demand for stocks and company
debt.  Purchases totaled C$6.74 billion ($6.49 billion) during the
month, from C$14.91 billion in April, Statistics Canada said
today in Ottawa. Purchases of money market instruments and bonds
fell to C$5.54 billion, from C$12.75 billion the previous month,
as non-resident investors shed C3.50 billion of federal and
provincial bonds.  Foreign investors bought C$1.20 billion of equities, down
from C$2.15 billion in April.  The May buying increased the year-to-date total to C$30.62
billion, down 28 percent from C$42.28 billion for the same
period last year.  Canadians repatriated investments from abroad in May,
 selling  C$1.65 billion of foreign securities, as the sale of
C$2.17 billion worth of equities outweighed net purchases of
international debt securities.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said investment in
non-residential building construction decreased 3.4 percent to
C$12.48 billion in the second quarter from the prior period, in
part due to a strike in  Quebec . The drop ended five straight
quarters of increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
