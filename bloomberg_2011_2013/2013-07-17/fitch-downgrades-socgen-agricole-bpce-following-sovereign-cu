Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,  Credit Agricole (ACA) 
SA and Groupe BPCE had their credit grades cut at  Fitch Ratings 
following last week’s decision to strip France of its top
rating.  Societe Generale , Credit Agricole and BPCE, three of
France’s four biggest banks by assets, had their long-term
issuer default rating cut to A from A+, with stable outlook,
Fitch said in a statement today.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , France’s
largest bank, saw its long-term credit grade A+ unchanged with a
stable outlook unaffected, Fitch said.  France on July 12 was cut by one level to AA+ from AAA by
Fitch, which highlighted concern about lack of growth and a
buildup of debt in Europe’s second-largest economy. Fitch joined
Moody’s Investors Service and  Standard & Poor’s  in removing
France from the shrinking club of top rated nations.  “The downgrade of the French state to AA+ means that Fitch
considers its ability to support French banks has decreased
slightly,” the ratings agency said  Fitch also cut the rating of  Dexia SA (DEXB)  and Dexia Credit
Local to A from A+ with stable outlook and downgraded state-owned La Banque Postale’s long-term credit grade to A+ from AA-with stable outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
