German stocks  rose, rebounding from
yesterdayâ€™s decline, as investors awaited a testimony by Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke before Congress.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  climbed 2.4 percent.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  dropped
2.3 percent for the worst performance on the benchmark  DAX (DAX) 
Index.  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , a maker of polysilicon, slipped 1.3
percent.  The DAX Index added 0.3 percent to 8,221.83 at 10:04 a.m.
in Frankfurt. The measure slumped 9.8 percent since May 22
through June 24 after Bernanke signaled the Fed may pare bond
purchases this year if the economy strengthens in line with
forecasts. The DAX has rebounded 6.9 percent since then as
central banks pledged to continue supporting economic recovery.
The broader HDAX Index rose 0.2 percent today.  Bernanke begins his two-day semi-annual report on monetary
policy to Congress today. His prepared testimony to the House
Financial Services Committee will be released at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington  and the hearing will begin 90 minutes later.  A Commerce Department report at 8:30 a.m. in Washington may
show U.S.  housing starts  increased at a 960,000 annual pace in
June, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. They rose at a 914,000 rate in May.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the DAX was 43 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
