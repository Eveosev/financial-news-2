Swiss  investor confidence  increased
only slightly in July, signaling the economy may struggle to
gain further momentum amid a slump in the neighboring euro area.  An index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance, rose to
4.8 points in July from 2.2 in June, the ZEW Center for European
Economic Research in  Mannheim , Germany, and Zurich-based  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said in a statement today.  The “indicator suggests that analysts’ are still cautious
in their expectations for economic growth,” Credit Suisse’s
Maxime Botteron and Lena Jaroszek of the ZEW said.  To shield the economy from the turmoil in the 17-nation
currency bloc, its biggest trading partner, the Swiss National
Bank has a limit of 1.20 per euro on the franc to reduce the
risk of deflation and recession.  The SNB is expected to keep the euro-franc floor for 1–2
years, Botteron and Jaroszek also said, adding that the majority
of survey participants now forecast no change in the franc’s
rate versus the euro over the next six months.  The euro-area economy has contracted the past six quarters,
its longest recession on record. Swiss growth for the first
quarter outpaced that even of neighboring  Germany , and the SNB
expects growth as much as 1.5 percent this year.  In Germany, investor confidence unexpectedly dropped in
July, falling to 36.3 from 38.5 in June, compared to a median
economist estimate of 40, ZEW said yesterday.  The Swiss survey of 44 analysts was conducted between July
1 and 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
