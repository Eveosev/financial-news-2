Natural gas futures declined in  New
York , snapping a three-day increase.  Gas for August delivery fell as much as 1 percent to $3.640
per million British thermal units in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $3.671 at 11 a.m.
Singapore time. The contract rose 0.1 percent to $3.677
yesterday on speculation that U.S. government data will show a
smaller-than-normal gain in stockpiles of the power-plant fuel
as hot weather boosted demand.  An Energy Information Administration report tomorrow may
show inventories climbed 60 billion cubic feet in the week ended
July 12, according to the median estimate of seven analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The five-year average gain is 70
billion. The weather was warmer than normal in most of the U.S.
last week, MDA Weather Services data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
