West Texas Intermediate traded near
the highest price in a week after U.S. crude inventories dropped
to the lowest level since January, shrinking the grade’s
discount to North Sea Brent to the least in five trading
sessions.  Futures were little changed in  New York  after rising 0.5
percent yesterday. Stockpiles fell by 6.9 million barrels to 367
million in their third weekly decrease, the longest run of
declines this year, as refiners processed the most crude in
almost eight years, the Energy Information Administration said
yesterday. Gasoline and diesel demand typically increases during
the peak vacation season in summer.  “U.S. demand is fairly stable,” said Andy Sommer, a
senior oil analyst at Axpo Trading AG in Dietikon,  Switzerland ,
who predicts Brent will trade from $110 to $112 a barrel this
year. “It looks like U.S. refiners are preparing for a pick-up
in demand from export markets in  Latin America .”  WTI for August delivery was at $106.75 a barrel, up 27
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:53 p.m. London time. The volume of all futures traded was
about 18 percent below the 100-day average. The contract climbed
48 cents to $106.48 yesterday, the highest close since July 10.  Brent for September settlement slid 43 cents to $108.18 a
barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European
benchmark grade’s premium to WTI contracted to as little as
$1.70 a barrel, the least since July 11, from $2.26 yesterday.  Fuel Supplies  U.S. refineries operated at an average 92.8 percent of
capacity last week, the highest rate in a year, and processed
16.2 million barrels a day, the most since August 2005, said the
EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm. The nation’s crude
output surged to the highest since December 1990. Gasoline
inventories rose by 3.1 million barrels compared with a 1.5
million decline predicted in the Bloomberg survey.  “Refineries are ramping up because of the traditional
period,” said  Jonathan Barratt , the chief executive officer of
Barratt’s Bulletin in Sydney, who predicts investors may sell
WTI at about $107.30 a barrel. “Consumption is seasonal. The
market is certainly reacting” to the data, he said.  Crude stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for futures traded in New York and the biggest U.S. oil-storage
hub, fell by 882,000 barrels to 46.1 million, according to the
EIA. That’s the lowest level since November.  China  pumped crude at the fastest pace in more than two and
a half years as the nation’s explorers sought to profit from
rising prices. The world’s second-biggest oil consumer produced
17.44 million metric tons last month, figures from the National
Bureau of Statistics in Beijing show. That’s equivalent to 4.26
million barrels a day, the highest rate since November 2010,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on the data.  Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest crude exporter, shipped
7.79 million barrels a day in May, the Joint Organizations Data
Initiative said on its website yesterday. That’s the most since
June last year, when it sold 7.84 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
