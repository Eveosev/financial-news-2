Syrian Kurdish fighters have
expelled a group linked to al-Qaeda from their border town after
clashes that left 11 people dead, the Syrian Observatory for
 Human Rights  said today.  The fighting pitted combatants from the Kurdish Defense
Units against radical Islamists attached to the al-Nusra Front
and the Islamic State of  Iraq  and the Levant, which are both al-Qaeda affiliates, Rami Abdurrahman, founder of the U.K.-based
Observatory, said in a phone interview. The confrontation began
yesterday in Ras al-Ain, al-Hasaka Province, he said.  According to the Observatory, the conflict was sparked by
an Islamist attack on a women’s patrol belonging to the Kurdish
group. The Kurdish fighters forced the Islamists from the town
today and the exchanges are continuing close to a checkpoint on
the Turkish border, Abdurrahman said. At least nine Islamists
died along with Kurdish fighters. Abdurrahman said the Kurds
were trying to keep both Islamists and forces loyal to  Syria ’s
President Bashar al-Assad from their town.  Fighters from al-Nusra and the Islamic State of Iraq and
the Levant, which seek to impose their extreme version of Islam
in areas under their control, have been targeting other rebels,
mostly the Free Syrian Army, the main rebel group fighting
Assad. On July 11, they killed senior FSA commander Kamal Hamami
at a checkpoint in the Turkmen mountains near the northern city
of Latakia. Iraqi al-Qaeda and al-Nusra merged in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
