Iran  agreed with Pakistan to import
wheat valued at $9 million from its eastern neighbor in exchange
for electricity it exported, Iranian Deputy Energy Minister
Mohammad Behzad said.  Iran supplied electricity valued at $51 million in total to
Pakistan for which the Persian Gulf country hasn’t been able to
secure payment, according to the state-run  Mehr  news agency
Mehr, as international sanctions restrict its financial
transactions. The prohibitions are designed to curb Iran’s
disputed nuclear program.  “We agreed on barter of goods in exchange for electricity
supplies,” Mehr cited Behzad as saying. Iran’s Ministry of
Industry, Mines and Trade decided on the nature of goods to be
received, he said. The two nations agreed for  Pakistan  to
provide rice as well as the wheat, according to Mehr.  A new set of U.S. sanctions came into force in February
designed to restrict buyers of Iranian oil to making payments in
local currencies rather than dollars or euros, with the funds
kept in escrow accounts that Iran can use only to buy locally
sourced goods and services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
