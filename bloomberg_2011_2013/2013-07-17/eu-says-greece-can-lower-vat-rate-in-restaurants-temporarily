The European Commission signaled the
Greek government is free temporarily to reduce value-added tax
in restaurants, saying the step wouldn’t undermine public
finances.  “A reduction in the VAT rate for the restaurant sector
would be possible without running any budgetary risks, so long
as it was just a temporary measure,” Simon O’Connor, a
spokesman at the commission, the 28-nation European Union’s
executive arm, told reporters today in Brussels. “We’ve been
working on this for the last few days.”  The government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras wants to
lower the VAT rate in restaurants to 13 percent from 23 percent
while remaining eligible for emergency aid granted by the euro
area and the  International Monetary Fund  in return for narrowing
the country’s budget deficit.  “As far as I know, it’s the government’s intention to
start reducing the VAT rate as from August until the end of the
year,” O’Connor said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
