Luxury cars are some of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced machines out there, incorporating everything from new alloys to computing power. One thing, however, hasn't changed: the animal pelts that line our car interiors.  So why have interior materials lagged so far behind? Is leather still the best upholstery, or is it purely a way for car companies to make an extra few thousand dollars without trying very hard? Turns out, the problem isn't with car companies. It's with consumer demand. There are some extremely sophisticated synthetic alternatives out there that customers just don't want. "There are a lot of tech materials being developed for the automotive industry," says Sandy McGill, a  BMW Design Works  lead designer based in Los Angeles. "You can get different functionality from the textiles, with ceramic impregnated in them with cooling and warming benefits."  There's material technology, in other words, that's outpaced leather by a mile, but it's hard to shake the perception of natural hides being synonymous with luxury. "There is this traditional mentality," says McGill. "People want leather in their cars." Why have people been so quick to adopt new technology (touchscreen navigation controls, for example), but so hesitant to try alternative fabrics? McGill sites the breakneck speed of development as precisely the reason that people still gravitate to leather. "We're living in the world of digital media," she says. "Leather is associated with sensuality and nature. That's why it will still be desirable in the future." Skip Horween, the president of  Horween Leathers , a Chicago leather tannery that supplies the leather to the NFL, along with John Lobb USA, Timberland, and Alden shoes, agrees. "The concept that you have something that looks like you took the time to break it in is very comforting," says Horween.  So together with its role as a status object, consumers seem to gravitate towards leather based on a nostalgia for a simpler time. McGill thinks the catalyst for change will come from the top of the luxury market and work its way down. "Alcantara is a synthetic suede from Italy. It's very fine, it's very consistent in its texture, and we originally thought it would be used in seats for race cars, because it grips you and holds you in your seat," she says. "I see Alcantara as breaking into the leather barrier," she continues. "Once something aside from leather is acceptable on the seat, then other things will be too."  But until that happens, consumers will maintain their paradox of choice: Jetsons on the outside, Flintstones on the inside.
