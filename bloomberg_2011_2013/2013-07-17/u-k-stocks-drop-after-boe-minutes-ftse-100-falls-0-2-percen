U.K. stocks declined, erasing an
earlier rally, after Bank of England minutes showed Governor
Mark Carney united officials to vote unanimously in favor of
holding bond purchases.  The FTSE 100 Index fell 14.25 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,542.1 at 9:46 a.m. in  London  after earlier rising as much as
0.5 percent. The FTSE All-Share Index also lost 0.2 percent.  At Carneyâ€™s first meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee
voted 9-0 to keep the target of its bond-purchase program at 375
billion pounds ($566 billion). All nine also voted to keep the
key interest rate at a record-low 0.5 percent, according to the
minutes of their July 3-4 meeting published today in London.  BOE officials Paul Fisher and David Miles had previously
called for more stimulus to support growth.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
