Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO)  dropped as
Citigroup Inc. forecast Colombia’s largest retailer will report
an 18 percent decline in profit this year, challenging analysts’
consensus view that earnings will rebound.  Shares declined 0.3 percent to 32,500 pesos at 11:53 a.m.
in Bogota, after earlier dropping as much as 1 percent. The
benchmark Colcap index gained 1 percent.  Exito’s earnings decline will accelerate to 18 percent by
year-end from a 4.7 percent drop in the first quarter as
competition picks up in the industry, Citigroup analysts Julio Zamora and Marcela Munoz wrote in a report today.  Citigroup’s call for a decline compares with a median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of four analysts for a 7 percent
gain in the company’s profit to 507 billion pesos this year.  “We are looking for margin pressure from new competitors
and a lower margin sales mix to further the impact on net
income,” the Citigroup analysts wrote. “The level of
competition in  Colombia  will become more intense in the coming
years.”  Citigroup initiated coverage of Exito, which is based in
Medellin, with a “sell” rating and a twelve-month target price
of 30,400 pesos, which would mean a 5.5 percent loss from
current levels, including dividends, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
