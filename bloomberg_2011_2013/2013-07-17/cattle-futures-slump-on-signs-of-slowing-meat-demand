Cattle futures fell for the second
straight day on speculation that hot weather across the U.S. is
reducing meat demand as fewer people grill outdoors. Hogs fell.  Temperatures soared into the 90s Fahrenheit (30s Celsius)
this week, and humidity increased along the East Coast, Midwest
and southern  Canada , according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland . Wholesale  beef  fell for the eighth straight
session, the longest slump since late March, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  “Heat waves are never good for meat demand,” Lawrence Kane, a senior market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group, said in
a telephone interview from  Yates City ,  Illinois . “We had a
lousy start to grilling season because of rainy weather. Now, if
we have an extended heat weave, it’s going to keep some people
in.”  Cattle futures for October delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$1.26 a pound at 10:53 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slipped 0.5
percent to $1.51725 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.1 percent to
85.225 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
