Canadian  stocks  rose to the highest
in six weeks after lenders rallied as the central bank raised
its 2013 growth forecast and investors analyzed testimony from
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke.  Royal Bank of Canada, the nation’s largest lender, climbed
to a seven-week high. Pengrowth Energy Corp. surged 8.3 percent
as at least two analysts upgraded the company.  Cineplex Inc. (CGX) 
advanced to a record high after offering to acquire a digital
signage company. B2Gold Corp. and Torex Gold Resources Inc. sank
at least 7.8 percent as the price of gold slumped.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 51.88
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,568.77 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
highest close since June 4. Trading was 5.6 percent lower than
the 30-day average.  “The banks are up off of U.S. banks, like Goldman Sachs,
whose results so far are pretty good,” said John Goldsmith,
deputy head of equities with Montrusco Bolton Investments in
Toronto. The firm manages about C$5.6 billion. “Until the end
of the month when  Canada  earnestly kicks off its earnings
season, a lot of it will be led by earnings from the States.”  The Fed’s Bernanke said in prepared testimony to Congress
this morning that the central bank’s asset purchases “are by no
means on a preset course” and could be either reduced or
expanded as conditions warrant.  Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz kept his main
interest rate unchanged at 1 percent in his first policy
decision since taking over the job in June. He said there will
be a “gradual normalization” of borrowing costs over time as
slack in the economy disappears and inflation picks up.  Economic Forecast  The central bank raised its economic growth forecast for
this year to 1.8 percent from an April prediction of 1.5
percent, while lowering the 2014 prediction to 2.7 percent from
2.8 percent.  Poloz is counting on exports and business investment to
accelerate growth in the world’s 11th largest economy. Expansion
has been slowed by weak foreign demand, leading to the longest
streak of trade deficits in a quarter century.  More than 60 Canadian companies on the TSX are  scheduled  to
report second-quarter earnings in the next two weeks. Bank of
America Corp. beat analysts estimates today, posting a 63
percent gain in second-quarter profit. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said yesterday it doubled its earnings, beating forecasts.  Eight of 10  groups  in the S&P/TSX advanced, with financial
stocks rising 1 percent as a group.  Royal Bank added 2 percent to C$63.80, the highest close
since May 29. Bank of Nova Scotia gained 1.6 percent to C$58.04
and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce added 1.5 percent to
C$77.12.  Pengrowth Energy  Pengrowth Energy surged 8.3 percent to C$5.88, the biggest
gain since March 2009, after the oil producer said yesterday it
has agreed to sell C$700 million of non-core assets that will be
used to fund the first phase of its Lindbergh oil-sands project.
Jeremy Kaliel, analyst with CIBC World Markets, and Jonathan Fleming, analyst with Cormark Securities Inc., each raised their
ratings for the stock.  Cineplex, Canada’s largest movie theater chain, added 1.4
percent to C$38.22, the highest close since its initial offering
in 2003. The Toronto-based company said today it has offered to
acquire  London , Ontario-based EK3 Technologies Inc. for an
initial price of C$40 million. That figure could rise to C$78
million if certain operating targets are achieved in 2015.  Torex Gold retreated 7.8 percent to C$1.30 and B2Gold lost
7.9 percent to C$2.55 as gold futures for December delivery fell
1 percent to settle at $1,278.80, the biggest loss since July 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
