Portugal’s borrowing costs increased
to the highest since October at an auction of 1.2 billion euros
($1.58 billion) of 12-month bills.  The securities due in July 2014 were allotted at an average
yield of 1.72 percent, the debt management agency said. That
compares with 1.232 percent at a previous auction of 12-month
bills on May 15, and is the highest since Portugal sold the
securities at a rate of 2.1 percent on Oct. 17. The auction
attracted bids for 1.77 times the amount offered, compared with
a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.22 in May.  Today’s sale was Portugal’s first in four weeks, a period
during which the finance minister resigned and a rift in the
governing coalition emerged. The two coalition parties are
holding a fourth day of talks with the main opposition party
today as they seek an agreement on how to meet the conditions of
the country’s bailout program.  “The internal political deadlock may have weighed a little
on the 12-month bill yield,” Filipe Silva, director of asset
management at Banco Carregosa SA in Oporto, northern Portugal,
said in an e-mailed note.  The two-year note yield was little changed at 5.44 percent
as of 2 p.m. London time.  Ten-year (GSPT10YR)  bond yields rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.20 percent, up from 6.39
percent on July 1, the day before the rift in the coalition
emerged. The 10-year rate breached a seven-month high of more
than 8 percent on July 3. The country pays 3.2 percent on its
bailout loans.  Bond Issuance  The debt agency also sold 300 million euros of bills due in
December at 1.045 percent, attracting bids for 4.4 times the
amount offered. The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, said on
July 12 that the total indicative amount for today’s auctions
was between 1.25 billion euros and 1.5 billion euros.  Portugal sold 10-year bonds on May 7, the first such sale
in more than two years. The nation had stopped selling bonds
until this year after requesting a 78 billion-euro bailout from
the European Union and International Monetary Fund in April 2011
following a surge in debt levels and borrowing costs. Portugal
is ranked below investment grade by Fitch Ratings, Moody’s
Investors Services and Standard & Poor’s.  The debt agency also said on July 12 that it plans to
resume “regular issuance” of bonds “only if market conditions
are conducive.” Financing needs for 2013 are “fully covered”
and in the second quarter the debt agency started to “pre-fund” for borrowing needs in 2014, according to the IGCP.  Aid Program  The eighth review of Portugal’s progress on meeting the
terms of its aid program has been pushed back to the end of
August or the start of September due to the political situation,
the Finance Ministry said on July 11. The review had been due to
start on July 15.  On March 15, the government announced less ambitious
targets for narrowing its budget deficit as it forecast the
economy will shrink twice as much as previously estimated this
year. It targets a deficit of 5.5 percent of gross domestic
product in 2013, 4 percent in 2014 and below the EU’s 3 percent
limit in 2015, when it aims for a 2.5 percent gap. Portugal
forecasts debt will peak at 123.7 percent of GDP in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
