Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index climbing for a third day, as the yen weakened against the
dollar and investors awaited testimony by Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  starting today.  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)  surged 11 percent after the Nikkei
newspaper said the automaker will pay a dividend for the first
time in 16 years. NEC Corp. advanced 4.8 percent on a report the
electronics manufacturer may exit its smartphone business.
Carmaker Toyota Motor Corp. reversed earlier losses to close 0.6
percent higher as the yen weakened. Furuno Electric Co., which
makes sonar and radar equipment, tumbled 9.8 percent after
cutting its profit forecast.  The Topix added 0.2 percent to 1,213.24 at the close of
trading in  Tokyo , after swinging between gains and losses in the
afternoon. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.1 percent to
14,615.04. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined yesterday as
Coca-Cola Co.’s profit dropped and Fed Bank of Kansas City
President Esther George called for stimulus cuts.  “We’re now waiting for what Bernanke is going to say, and
for him to answer what would warrant cuts to stimulus,” said
 Ayako Sera , a strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd.,
which manages the equivalent of $163 billion in corporate
pensions. “Investors are now looking for a catalyst for further
gains.”  Economic Reforms  After  plunging  as much as 18 percent from a May 22 high,
the Topix has rebounded amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
will push through economic reforms following elections on July
21. The gauge added 14 percent in the past four weeks, the
biggest such advance since April 2009.  Futures on the S&P 500 were little changed today. Bernanke
is scheduled to deliver his semi-annual monetary policy report
to Congress this week, starting today at the House Financial
Services Committee. The Fed chairman has said any reduction in
stimulus will be tied to sustained improvement in the labor
market or an increase in the rate of inflation.  Japan ’s currency weakened 0.3 percent to 99.37 per dollar
today, after climbing 0.8 percent yesterday. The yen is the
worst-performing major currency since mid-November.  Toyota, which counts  North America  as its biggest market
for sales, rose 0.6 percent to 6,500 yen, the  second-biggest 
boost to the Topix. Honda Motor Co., which gets 83 percent of
sales outside of Japan, climbed 0.9 percent to 3,845 yen.
Panasonic Corp., the maker of Viera televisions, added 2.7
percent to 881 yen.  Great Expectations  There are “big expectations” for corporate earnings,
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust’s Sera said. “Especially within the
exporter sector, expectations are quite high. However, we want
to keep an eye on which companies benefit from a weaker yen and
which ones have a negative impact.”  Earnings at Topix companies will surge 95 percent to 22.70
yen per share, compared with 11.67 yen per share last quarter,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings
are projected to grow 56 percent for the year, the data show.
Quarterly profits on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index are
projected to rise 5.9 percent, according to Bloomberg data.  Among other stocks that rose, Mitsubishi Motors jumped 11
percent to 160 yen. The automaker will pay out 30 to 40 percent
of its profit to shareholders in dividends this fiscal year, the
Nikkei newspaper reported, without citing anyone. The carmaker
is projecting net income of 50 billion yen and annual dividends
are likely to exceed 10 yen per share, Nikkei said. Mitsubishi
Motors is not the source of the report, it said.  Nintendo Co. (7974)  jumped 6.5 percent to 13,540 yen, its highest
level since July 2011, after Mizuho Financial Group Inc. raised
its price target for the maker of video-game consoles. Sales of
new software titles will increase later this year, Mizuho said.  NEC Jumps  NEC climbed 4.8 percent to 242 yen, its biggest gain since
June 28. The company plans to close its smartphone operations,
the Nikkei reported without citing anyone. The mobile-phone unit
has liabilities exceeding assets by about 60 billion yen, the
newspaper said. NEC said it’s not the source of the report.  Among stocks that fell, Furuno Electric tumbled 9.8 percent
to 749 yen, its biggest decline since March 2011. The Hyogo,
western Japan-based company cut its half-year net-income
forecast by 64 percent after posting a quarterly loss of 407
million yen.  The Topix traded at 1.29 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.47 for the  S&P 500  and 1.66 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday. The gauge’s 30-day  historic volatility  was at
30.55 today, retreating from its July 2 high of 43.22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
