China  will lend as much as $10
billion during the next six years at below-market rates to fund
infrastructure projects in the  Ivory Coast , according to the
West African nation’s planning minister.  The majority of the concessional loans will come from the
Export-Import Bank of China, Albert Mabri Toikeusse said in a
July 10 interview from Paris. Lu Pang, the economic and
commercial counselor at the Chinese embassy in Ivory Coast,
declined to comment.  Ivory Coast’s economy will expand 9 percent this year as
the government seeks to lure investment back after five months
of post-election crisis in 2010 and 2011 that spooked investors,
led to violence that killed about 3,000 and forced the country
to miss payments on its international debt.  “Our partner China will help us a lot, through flexible
loans to fund development and infrastructures,” Toikeusse said.  The funds will be used to finance a $2.5 billion expansion
of the port of Abidjan, which is the nation’s largest and is
used by landlocked neighbors Burkina Faso and  Mali . About $2
billion will be used to build a railroad between the western
town of Man and  San Pedro , the country’s second largest port.  Sinohydro Corp. began construction on a 275-megawatt
hydroelectric power plant in western town of Soubre this year
financed by a $500 million loan from the bank  To contact the reporters on this story:
