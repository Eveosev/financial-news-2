Daimler AG  plans to cut car-
production costs by 10 percent annually in 2012 and 2013,
 Reuters reported , citing Wolfgang Nieke, a works council member.  The efficiency drive was started by the Mercedes-Benz Cars
unit’s head of production, Wolfgang Bernhard, two weeks ago and
is also targeted at reducing the time needed to build a vehicle,
in an attempt to close the profitability gap with Volkswagen
AG’s Audi brand and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , Reuters cited
Nieke as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
