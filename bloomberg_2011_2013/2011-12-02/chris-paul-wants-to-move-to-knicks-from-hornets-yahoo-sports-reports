Chris Paul  wants to join his close
friend  Carmelo Anthony  on the  New York Knicks , Yahoo Sports
reported, citing National Basketball Association people familiar
with the decision who requested anonymity.  Paul’s agent told New Orleans Hornets officials his client,
who will make $17.7 million next season, won’t sign a contract
extension with the team, the sports website said.  As a free agent next year, Paul could sign a maximum four-
year, $74 million contract with another team, Yahoo said. The
Knicks will be able to offer the point guard a four-year, $55.5
million deal with a starting salary of $13 million, it reported.  Paul, the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2006 and a four-time
All-Star, has averaged 18.7 points in 425 career games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
