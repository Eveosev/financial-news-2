Spain’s  Rafael Nadal  and  David Ferrer 
both won singles matches to open the country’s best-of-five
Davis Cup final against Argentina.  Ferrer, No. 5 in the ATP World Tour rankings, came back to
beat 11th-ranked Juan Martin del Potro 6-2, 6-7 (2-7), 3-6, 6-4,
6-3 in a 4 hour, 43-minute match on indoor clay courts in
Seville.  Ferrer is now 17-4 in Davis Cup matches, including a 12-0
record on clay. Del Potro’s record dropped to 9-3 at the Davis
Cup, the largest annual international men’s tennis tournament.  In the first match, Spain’s Nadal, ranked No. 2, won 6-1,
6-1, 6-2 over  Juan Monaco , who is ranked 26th by the men’s
tennis tour. Nadal is now 19-1 in singles for  Spain , with his
only loss coming as a 17-year-old in 2004.  Spain’s Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco will take on
Argentina’s David Nalbandian and Eduardo Schwank in a doubles
match tomorrow, while Nadal will play Del Potro and Ferrer will
face Monaco in two days.  Spain has won the Davis Cup four times in the last decade:
2000, 2004, 2008 and 2009. Argentina, which was runner-up in
1981, 2006 and 2008, has never won the trophy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
