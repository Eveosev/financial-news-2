Gold may drop as a better-than-
expected U.S. manufacturing report outweighed concern that
 Europe ’s debt crisis will slow global growth, curbing demand for
a haven. Palladium headed for its biggest weekly gain in a year.  Bullion for immediate-delivery fell as much as 0.4 percent
to $1,738.05 an ounce and traded little changed at $1,743.28 at
3:22 p.m. in  Singapore . Gold is set for a 3.6 percent increase
this week, the best performance since Oct. 28. Palladium
increased 0.9 percent to $636.75 an ounce, poised for a 12
percent five-day gain, the most since December last year.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index
increased to 52.7 last month from 50.8 in October, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said yesterday. Readings above 50 indicate
expansion and economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a
gain to 51.8. Payrolls may have climbed by 125,000 workers in
November, after rising 80,000 the prior month, a Bloomberg
survey showed ahead of a Labor Department report due today.  “Anything positive that comes out of the U.S. is good and
will probably take pressure off the price of gold,” said
Alexandra Knight, an economist at National Australia Bank Ltd.
Prices may also drop after declines in the  U.S. dollar , she said.  The dollar traded at $1.3462 per euro, set for a 1.7
percent decline since Nov. 25, the first weekly drop in five.  Gold Holdings  The Bank of  Korea , which controls the world’s eighth-
biggest  foreign-exchange reserves , boosted gold holdings for the
second time this year as investors sought safer assets amid
Europe’s debt crisis.  The central bank bought 15 metric tons last month, boosting
holdings to 54.4 tons, which is equivalent to 0.7 percent of its
total reserves, Lee Jung, head of the investment strategy team
at the bank’s Reserve Management Group, told reporters in  Seoul .  Bullion has climbed 23 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6 and beating equities, Treasuries
and other commodities. Central banks are expanding reserves for
the first time in a generation as the precious metal is in the
11th year of a  bull market .  Holdings  in exchange-traded products backed by gold were at
2,355.504 tons yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
That’s down from a record 2,356.002 tons reached on Nov. 30.  Cash silver gained 0.4 percent to $32.8613 an ounce. Spot
platinum fell 0.2 percent to 1,556.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
