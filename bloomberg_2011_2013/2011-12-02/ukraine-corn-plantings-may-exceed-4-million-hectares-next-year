Ukraine’s farmers may plant more than
4 million hectares (9.88 million acres) of corn for next year’s
harvest after record production, according to Oleksandr Demidov,
head of the crop department at the  Agriculture Ministry .  Total grain plantings next year will be 15 million
hectares, Demidov said at a press conference in Kiev today. The
corn crop for the 2011 harvest is already an all-time high of 21
million metric tons, with about 150,000 hectares yet to be
collected, he said. Plantings for this crop were 3.57 million
hectares, according to state statistics office data.  “Corn guarantees more or less stable revenues,” said
Volodymyr Lapa, an analyst at the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club,
at the same meeting.  Chicago corn futures have climbed 8.5 percent in the past
year while wheat is down 18 percent and soybeans declined 11
percent. About 32 percent of 1.6 million hectares of wheat
plantings are “weak and thinned,” Demidov said. About 28
percent is in “good” condition and 40 percent is
“satisfactory,” he said.  Ukraine’s 2011 grain harvest was 57 million tons as of
yesterday, Demidov said. Wheat made up about 22 million tons and
barley 9.1 million tons, he said.  Winter barley has emerged on 65 percent of the 1.2 million
hectares of plantings, Demidov said. Some 18 percent of the
emerged crop was in good condition, 38 percent was satisfactory
and 43 percent was weak, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
