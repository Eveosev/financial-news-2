Newman-Haas Racing, co-founded by the
late actor  Paul Newman , is pulling out of the 2012 IndyCar
Series after 29 seasons of competition.  “The economic climate no longer enables Newman-Haas Racing
to participate in open-wheel racing at this time,” co-founder
Carl Haas said last night on the team’s website.  Last season, the team finished fourth in the IndyCar Series
with Oriol Servia. Driver James Hinchcliffe was chosen Rookie of
the Year.  From 1983-2011, Newman-Haas drivers earned eight
championships, 107 race wins and 109 pole positions.  The Lincolnshire, Illinois-based team never won the
Indianapolis 500, although it employed some of the most notable
drivers in race history, including Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell, Paul Tracy and Christian Fittipaldi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
