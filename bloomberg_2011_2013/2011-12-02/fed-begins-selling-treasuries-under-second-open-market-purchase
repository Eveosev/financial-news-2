The  Federal Reserve  began selling as
much as $8.75 billion of Treasuries in a second permanent open-
market transaction today as part of a program to lower borrowing
costs.  The Fed Bank of New York is considering Treasuries due from
April 2013 to October 2013 for sale in this operation, according
to its  website .  The central bank bought $2.512 billion of securities
earlier today maturing from February 2036 through August 2041.  The Fed is replacing $400 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term securities through June. The program
has come to be known as Operation Twist, after a similar plan in
the 1960s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
