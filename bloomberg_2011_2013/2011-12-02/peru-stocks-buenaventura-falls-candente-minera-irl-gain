The following companies are having
unusual price changes in  Peru  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 11.24 a.m.  Lima  time.  The  Lima General Index (IGBVL)  rose 0.1 percent to 19,827.02. The
 MSCI All Peru Capped Index  fell 0.4 percent to 2,550.48.  Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SAA (BVN)  , the country’s
biggest precious-metals miner, fell 2.2 percent to $37.42.
Buenaventura earlier slumped 12 percent, the most since June
2010, after anti-mining protests forced the company and partner
Newmont Mining Corp. to suspend work on the Minas Conga gold and
copper project, said Sebastian Blondet, a trader at Celfin
Capital in Lima.  Candente Copper Corp. (DNT)   climbed the most in three
weeks after the metal rose in  New York  as the U.S. jobless rate
fell, boosting the outlook for demand in the world’s second-
largest copper consumer. Candente rose 9.1 percent to $1.32.  Minera IRL Ltd. (MIRL)  , a U.K. minerals explorer with a
gold mine in Peru, added 2.7 percent to $1.15, a two-week high.
Gold advanced in New York on speculation that central banks may
increase holdings after  South Korea  bought bullion to diversify
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
