Asian stocks rose, with the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index set for its biggest weekly gain since August 2007,
ahead of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s speech to lawmakers
on  Europe ’s debt crisis and after U.S. manufacturing expanded
more than forecast.  DeNA Co., a social-network website operator, jumped 8.1
percent in  Tokyo  after Credit Suisse Group AG rated the shares
“outperform” in new coverage. Japanese shares gained after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG said
they’ll rebound.  Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) , a maker of
surfwear that counts the Americas as its biggest market, rose 4
percent in Sydney.  Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) , a Chinese
retailer of women’s shoes, sank 6.6 percent after an investor
was said to have sold HK$1 billion ($129 million) of shares.  “The U.S. manufacturing data was taken positively, when
pessimism on the global economy was weighing over investors’
minds,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , a senior fund manager in Tokyo
at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees $6 billion.
“It’s too early to be at ease about Europe’s debt crisis. At
the moment, Europe is trying to stack up sandbags to prevent
financial system turmoil from spilling over.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.5 percent to 117.70 as
of 7:36 p.m. in Tokyo, after falling as much as 0.4 percent. The
Asia-Pacific gauge is headed for an 8 percent gain for the week,
the biggest weekly gain since the period ended Aug. 24, 2007.
All but one of the 10 industry groups on the measure rose, with
almost twice as many stocks gaining as declining.  Japan  Rebound?  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.5 percent, and the
broader Topix Index gained 0.6 percent to 744.14. Goldman Sachs
said the Topix is likely to rise to 800 by the end of 2012 as
corporate profits rebound, while UBS said the gauge may rise to
about 930 in the year ending March 2013. Deutsche Bank said
signs of a recovery in the nation’s shares will likely emerge as
early as March next year, buoyed by renewed confidence in the
 U.S. economy .  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index advanced 1.4 percent, capping
its biggest weekly increase since November 2008. Hong Kong’s
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 0.2 percent after dropping as much as 0.7
percent.  China ’s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index slid
1.1 percent, while South Korea’s Kospi Index was little changed.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 15 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 1 percent drop by the  S&P 500 
and a 14 percent slump by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Stocks (MXAPJ)  in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.9 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 12.6 times for the S&P 500 and 10.5
times for the Stoxx 600.  Exporters Gain  Gauges of volatility across the region fell to their lowest
levels since July. The  HSI Volatility Index  plunged 23 percent
this week to 27.7 in Hong Kong, suggesting options traders see a
swing of 8 percent in the Hang Seng Index in the next 30 days.
The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index dropped 20 percent to
23.42 and the Kospi 200 Volatility Index fell 18 percent this
week.  Billabong rose 4 percent to A$3.86 in Sydney.  James Hardie
Industries SE (JHX) , a building-materials supplier that gets more than
half of its sales from the U.S., gained 1.6 percent to A$6.95.
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker by market
value, gained 1.1 percent to 2,594 yen.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 1.1 percent
today. The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
increased to 52.7 last month from 50.8 in October, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said today. Readings above 50 indicate
expansion, and economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a
gain to 51.8. Construction spending climbed for a third month in
October and jobless claims increased, other data showed.  Merkel Speech  “The U.S. economy isn’t as weak as investors feared,”
said Kenji Sekiguchi, general manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset
Management Co. “The focus has shifted temporarily away from
Europe and toward the U.S., while investors wait for Europe to
come up with policies.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , who will use a speech to
lawmakers in Berlin today to outline her stance before a Dec. 9
European Union summit, has repeated her push to rework EU rules
to lock in budget monitoring and seal off the  European Central
Bank  from political pressure. French President Nicolas Sarkozy
late yesterday called for “more discipline” and automatic
penalties for nations that break fiscal rules.  DeNA  surged 8.1 percent to 2,519 yen in Tokyo, its biggest
gain since Oct. 5 after Credit Suisse began coverage on the
shares and after JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its rating to
“overweight” from “underweight.”  Belle Slides  Belle International sank 6.6 percent to HK$14.22 after
people familiar with the transaction said an investor sold HK$1
billion ($129 million) of shares. The shareholder sold 70
million shares at HK$14.60 each, the high end of the proposed
price range, said the people, who declined to be identified as
the transaction is private.  Samsung Electronics Co., a smartphone maker, slumped 2.2
percent to 1,050,000 won in Seoul, the biggest drag on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index after Apple Inc. won a one-week extension of
a ban on Samsung’s sales of its latest tablet computer in
Australia, delaying pre-Christmas sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
