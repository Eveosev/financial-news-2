Olympic gold medalist  Lindsey Vonn 
won a downhill skiing race by almost two seconds today in Lake
Louise,  Canada , her 43rd career victory on the  World Cup 
circuit.  Vonn, a 27-year-old American who won the downhill title at
the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, captured her second World Cup win
of the season with a time of 1 minute, 53.19 seconds. Her
previous victory this season was in a giant slalom in Solden,
Austria.  Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein came from the 40th starting
position to capture second place in Lake Louise in 1:55.14 and
Dominique Gisin of Switzerland was third in 1:55.25 in the first
World Cup downhill of the season.  The almost two-second gap between Vonn and the rest of the
field is unusual in World Cup downhills, which often are decided
by hundredths of seconds.  “Skiing is the thing that is working in my life,” Vonn,
who announced last weekend that she is getting divorced, said in
a television interview. “It is a dream for me to have a victory
at this moment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
