Cyprus’s budget deficit will be
“significantly” below 2.8 percent of gross domestic product in
2012, Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias said.  Kazamias, who spoke to reporters in Nicosia today, said he
is “optimistic” the eastern Mediterranean island can avoid
seeking bailout funds after parties agreed on a fiscal
consolidation package with an unspecified budget impact.  “With these measures we are giving a convincing answer
that public expenditure will not increase in the next two
years,” the finance minister of the euro area’s third-smallest
economy said. “This will allow us to turn our efforts to
supporting economic growth and clamping down on  tax evasion ”.  Stefanos Stefanou, a spokesman for the government, said
earlier that the parties’ consensus on fiscal consolidation
includes a two-year freeze on public-sector wages, the
introduction of a levy on private-sector workers’ income, an
increase in the  tax rate  on dividends to 20 percent and an
increase in the value-added tax rate to 17 percent.  Today’s agreement also includes tax incentives for
investment in large development projects and a commitment for
additional budget cuts, Stefanou said. The government is
committed to a ratio of spending cuts to revenue increases of 2
to 1, he added.  Cyprus’s credit rating was lowered two levels Nov. 4 to
Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service after  Standard & Poor’s  cut it
on Oct. 27 to BBB from BBB+. Both cited fiscal concerns and
Cypriot banks’ holdings of Greek debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
