U.S. stocks were little changed,
wiping out gains spurred by a decrease in the jobless rate,
while Treasuries and the dollar rose amid concern next week’s
summit of European leaders will fail to stem the debt crisis.  The  S&P 500  dropped less than 0.1 percent to 1,244.28 at 4
p.m. New York time, erasing a 1.3 percent gain. Yields on 10-
year Treasuries fell five basis points to 2.04 percent and the
Dollar Index added 0.4 percent as the euro lost 0.5 percent to
$1.3391. Italy’s 10-year bond yield  climbed  three basis points
after losing 23 basis points. Oil rose to a two-week high amid
concern over tensions between  Iran  and the West.  The stocks rally started to  fizzle (SPX)  an hour after exchanges
opened, when the S&P 500 had extended its advance since Nov. 24
to 8.8 percent. The index finished with a weekly rally of 7.4
percent, the most since March 2009. Equities dropped as the euro
and Italian bonds reversed gains, with health-care companies
posting the biggest slump in the S&P 500. The Labor Department
said the U.S. jobless rate dropped to 8.6 percent, while
economists expected a 9 percent rate.  “The market should probably take this one in stride,”
Brian Jacobsen of Wells Fargo Advantage Funds said of today’s
U.S. jobs report. He helps oversee about $209 billion as chief
portfolio strategist at the firm in  Menomonee Falls ,  Wisconsin .
“More people are going to be focused on what’s going on in
 Europe ,” he said.  Meeting Next Week  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  dismissed suggestions for
quick solutions for dealing with the crisis. Speaking to
lawmakers in Berlin before next week’s European summit, she
rejected joint euro-area bonds or trying to make the European
Central Bank the lender of last resort.  Tenet Healthcare Corp. led S&P 500 losses, dropping 11
percent, after a Wells Fargo & Co. analyst said that Medicare
won’t pay for hospital stays in 11 states for heart and
orthopedic procedures until the treatment is reviewed and deemed
necessary. The S&P 500 Healthcare Equipment & Services index
dropped 1.8 percent, the most among 24 industries, following the
report from Wells Fargo.  Almost three stocks rose for  every  two that fell as the
Russell 2000 Index, a measure of the smallest U.S. companies,
advanced 0.6 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slumped
0.61 point, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,019.42.  Stocks surged this week after the  Federal Reserve  and five
other central banks lowered the cost of dollar funding and  China 
cut the proportion that banks need to hold as reserve capital.
The  stock index  is down 1.1 percent in 2011 after rising 13
percent since Oct. 3. Improving U.S. economic data alleviated
concern the world’s largest economy will contract as Europe’s
debt crisis threatens to derail the recovery.  Economic Surprises  The  Citigroup Economic Surprise Index  for the U.S. has
risen to the highest level since March 9. The gauge, which
measures the rate at which data is beating or missing economist
forecasts in Bloomberg surveys, reached 85.7 today and has
rebounded from a more-than two-year low of minus 117.2 in June.  Today’s jobs data showed payrolls climbed 120,000, with
more than half the hiring coming from retailers and temporary
help agencies, after a revised 100,000 rise in October that was
more than initially estimated. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey called for a gain of 125,000.  The euro had surged 1.7 percent versus the dollar during
the first four days of the week, rebounding from a seven-week
low on Nov. 25.  “We’ve priced in quite a bit of optimism in the last three
or four days,” said  Jens Nordvig , a managing director of
currency research in  New York  at Nomura Holdings Inc. “I’m
inclined to be very cautious in terms of risk positions going
into next week’s events.”  Spanish 10-year  government bonds  rose for a fifth day,
sending yields down more than 100 basis points in the week, the
most since the euro-region was created in 1999. German 10-year
bund yields slipped four basis points to 2.14 percent.  The S&P GSCI Index of 24  commodities  climbed 0.6 percent.
Crude oil futures rallied 0.8 percent, settling above $100 a
barrel for a third straight day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
