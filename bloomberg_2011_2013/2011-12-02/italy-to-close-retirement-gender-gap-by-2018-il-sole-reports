Italyâ€™s new measures to overhaul the
economy likely include increasing the pension age of women to
match that of men, and higher property taxes, newspaper  Il Sole
24 Ore  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The  retirement age  for women will be moved up to 63 from 60
immediately and increased to 66 or 67 by 2018 to align it with
men, the newspaper said.  Other moves may include discouraging early retirement, a
temporary halt to inflation-linked pension increases and higher
property taxes, Il Sole said. Steps to boost economic growth may
include broadening the scope of a credit fund for small and
medium-sized businesses and measures to help women and young
people join the workforce, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
