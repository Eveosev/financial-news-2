The euro rose against the yen as U.S.
unemployment dropped in November and on optimism the
 International Monetary Fund  will channel European Central Bank
loans to the region’s debt-strapped nations.  The 17-nation currency erased gains versus the dollar after
growth in U.S. payrolls fell short of economists’ forecasts. The
greenback headed for its first weekly loss versus the euro since
October as stocks rose. A plan to funnel ECB loans through the
IMF may deliver up to 200 billion euros ($271 billion) to fight
the debt crisis, two people familiar with the negotiations said.  “The fact that we had an outcome that wasn’t exceptionally
better than thought has brought in a little bit of profit
taking,” said Ray Attrill, a senior currency strategist at BNP
Paribas SA in New York, referring to the employment report. “We
had a decent run-up, the euro had gone up, so there was a little
bit of ‘buy the rumor, sell the fact.’”  The euro gained 0.1 percent to 104.74 yen at 10:43 a.m. New
York time. It declined 0.2 percent to $1.3438, after rising
earlier as much as 0.7 percent. The shared currency has advanced
1.5 percent this week versus the dollar. The yen weakened 0.3
percent to 77.95 per dollar.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners including the euro and yen, rose 0.2 percent to
78.442 after falling earlier as much as 0.4 percent. It reached
a seven-week high of 79.702 on Nov. 25.  Jobless Rate  The U.S. unemployment rate declined to 8.6 percent, the
lowest since March 2009, from 9 percent in October, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington .  Payrolls climbed by 120,000, compared with a forecast of a
125,000 gain in a Bloomberg News survey. More than half the
hiring came from retailers and temporary-help agencies. There
was a revised 100,000-job increase in October that was more than
initially estimated.  Euro-area finance ministers gave the go-ahead for work on
the IMF plan at a Nov. 29 meeting attended by ECB President
 Mario Draghi , said the two people, who declined to be named
because talks are at an early stage. The need for a new crisis-
containment tool emerged as the effort to boost the region’s 440
billion-euro rescue fund to 1 trillion euros fell short.  ‘More Meaningful Step’  “This goes to the heart of the day-to-day financing of
these nations,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at
the online currency trader GFT Forex in New York. “It’s a much
more meaningful step than a lot of the monetary intervention
that they had been doing.”  Spanish 10-year  government bonds  rose for a fifth day,
sending  yields  down more than 100 basis points in the week, the
most since the euro-region was created in 1999, to 5.55 percent.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Italian 10-year bond
 yields  dropped to 6.57 percent, trading below 7 percent for the
first time in a week.  The yen dropped versus most of its major peers as Japanese
Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  said he’ll take action on speculative
currency moves.  The yen climbed to a postwar record of 75.35 per dollar on
Oct. 31, prompting  Japan  to intervene in markets for the third
time this year to stem gains that endangered an export-led
economic recovery. The nation sold 9.09 trillion yen from Oct.
28 to Nov. 28, the Ministry of Finance said this week, the most
on a monthly basis in data going back to 1991.  U.S. Momentum  The U.S. economic recovery may be gaining momentum, data
earlier this week signaled. American manufacturing expanded in
November at the fastest pace in five months, an Institute for
Supply Management index showed yesterday. The Conference Board’s
index of  consumer confidence  increased to a reading of 56 last
month from 40.9 in October, the biggest jump since April 2003, a
report from the private research group showed on Nov. 29.  “With the strong consumer confidence and the decent ISM
yesterday, the expectations for today’s payrolls were
amplified,” said  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York. “It’s broadly
in line with expectations, but it’s not as good as widely hoped
for, hence the minor reaction so far in risk.”  Canada ’s dollar slipped 0.1 percent to C$1.0153. It
fluctuated earlier after data showed the nation’s employers
unexpectedly eliminated 18,600 jobs last month as U.S. payrolls
increased. The U.S. is Canada’s biggest trading partner.  South Africa ’s rand was the biggest winner among the
dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts. It appreciated 1 percent
to 8.0042, bringing its weekly gain to 6.7 percent, the most
since October 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
