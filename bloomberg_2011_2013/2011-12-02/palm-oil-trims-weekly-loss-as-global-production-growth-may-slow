Palm oil  gained, erasing earlier
losses, on concern that slowing production growth in  Indonesia 
and Malaysia, the biggest growers, may pare global cooking oil
stockpiles and on a prediction for higher prices.  The February-delivery contract rose 0.1 percent to close at
3,062 ringgit ($979) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. It fell 0.8 percent earlier. Futures dropped 0.2
percent this week, for a second weekly decline.  Global production growth may start to slow down and “turn
negative” by the middle of 2012, said James Fry, chairman of
LMC International Ltd. The slowdown in output will cut
stockpiles, he said at a conference in Bali, Indonesia.  Futures in Malaysia may advance to 3,300 ringgit a ton by
January and “gradually” climb to 4,000 ringgit by June, said
 Dorab Mistry , director of Godrej International Ltd., keeping a
forecast made in July. Malaysian production may be “flat” in
2012, between 18.6 million and 19 million tons, while output in
Indonesia may reach 26.5 million tons on new acreage, he said at
the same conference.  “With growth in CPO production decelerating and demand
remaining buoyant, prices must rise,” said Mistry, referring to
crude palm oil by its initials. “In years when palm oil
production growth is so low and demand growth is normal, we see
bull markets.”  January-delivery soybeans increased as much as 0.7 percent
to $11.3625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil 
for delivery in the same month gained as much as 0.5 percent to
49.95 cents per pound.  Palm oil for May dropped 0.2 percent to close at 7,958 yuan
($1,251) per ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and soybean
oil for the same month shed 0.2 percent to 8,820 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
