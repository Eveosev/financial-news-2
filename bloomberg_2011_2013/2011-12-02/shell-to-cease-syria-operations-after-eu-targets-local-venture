Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest oil company, will cease operations in Syria to comply
with the latest European Union sanctions against President
Bashar al-Assad’s government.  The EU said today it added three  oil companies  to the list
of those targeted by an asset freeze and travel ban: Syria
Trading Oil Co., General Petroleum Corp. and  Al Furat Petroleum
Co . Shell, China National Petroleum Corp. and Oil & Natural Gas
Corp. of India are partners in Al Furat, which produced about
100,000 barrels of oil a day, according to its website.  “We will cease activities in line with the sanctions and
our priority is the safety of our staff,”  David Williams , a
Shell spokesman, said by phone from  London . He declined to
comment further, saying that the company’s lawyers are still
working on the new sanctions requirements.  More than 4,000 people have been killed since protests
against Assad’s government started in March and more than 14,000
are in detention, United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights
Navi Pillay said today. The country risks falling into civil war
unless the government ends the crackdown, she said.
Demonstrations against al-Assad’s leadership were inspired by
the so-called Arab Spring movements that toppled leaders in
Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.  The U.S., Turkey and the Arab league have also applied
sanctions to Syria, while Russia on Oct. 4 blocked a UN
resolution calling for al-Assad to soften his actions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
