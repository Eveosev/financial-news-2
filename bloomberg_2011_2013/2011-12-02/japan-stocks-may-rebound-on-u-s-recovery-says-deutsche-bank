Signs of a recovery in  Japanese
stocks  will likely emerge as early as March next year, buoyed by
renewed confidence in the  U.S. economy , Deutsche Bank AG said.  The  Topix (TPX)  Index of the largest companies listed in Tokyo
will likely fluctuate in a range of between 700 and 750 at the
start of next year, Deutsche Bank strategists led by Naoki Kamiyama, said. The range will likely rise around April to June
and return the 850-890 seen around July 2011 if fears of a
recession subside, according to the report.  The Topix rose 0.6 percent to 744.14 as of the 3 p.m. close
in Tokyo trading. The benchmark has tumbled 17 percent this year
as signs emerged that Europeâ€™s debt crisis is spreading to major
economies.  -- Editor: Nick Gentle  To contact the reporter on this story:
