Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s  Germany  manager, Rene Schuster, predicts roaming fees will eventually be eliminated,
the  Berliner Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  Schuster said the fees will continue to fall over the next
two to three years because of strong competition, the newspaper
reported, according to an e-mailed preview of the interview that
