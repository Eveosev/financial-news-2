Centro Properties Group (CNP) , whose debt-
fueled U.S. buying spree backfired with the global financial
crisis, won final court approval for a plan to wipe out debt and
hand assets to creditors.  The  Supreme Court  of New South Wales approved the
reorganization, Centro Properties said in a statement to the
stock exchange today. The A$2.7 billion ($2.76 billion) of
senior debt that matures on Dec. 15 will be canceled and senior
lenders will receive the company’s Australian assets and
interests, it said.  Centro first announced a planned restructuring in 2009
after the financial crisis caused property values to plummet and
borrowing costs to soar. Share and debt holders of Centro
Properties and listed unit Centro Retail Trust approved the
proposal last week, which will give lenders control of the new
Centro Retail Australia trust in exchange for forgiving debt.  “This is a major achievement for Centro and its
stakeholders,” Centro Properties Chairman  Paul Cooper  said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
