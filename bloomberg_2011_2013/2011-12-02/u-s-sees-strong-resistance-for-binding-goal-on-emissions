The U.S. said there’s “strong
resistance” from some developing nations for measures at UN
climate talks that would require them to sign up to mandatory
targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Jonathan Pershing , the lead environment envoy for the U.S.
at the talks in Durban,  South Africa , this week was responding
to a question about whether a European Union proposal to broaden
participation in the cuts was gaining traction.  “My own sense is that while some want it others do not,”
Pershing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
