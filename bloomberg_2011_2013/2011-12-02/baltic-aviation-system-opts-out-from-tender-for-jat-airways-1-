Baltic Aviation Systems , the only
potential bidder for JAT Airways, withdrew from a tender for
 Serbia ’s state-owned flag carrier.  Baltic Aviation Systems gave no reason for its withdrawal
and the Serbian government is now working on a proposal on what
to do with the unprofitable company, the Infrastructure Ministry
said in an e-mailed statement. This was the third attempt to
sell the airline that flies to 29 destinations with 14 aircraft
whose average age exceeds 15 years.  The government said earlier it would try to restructure the
company to create a smaller, leaner carrier with a renewed fleet
and free from liabilities worth more than 19 billion dinars
($247.8 million). JAT’s net loss widened to 2.5 billion dinars
in 2010 from 1.1 billion dinars in the previous year.  The announcement came a day after Latvia bought out Baltic
Aviation System’s minority stake in AirBaltic AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
