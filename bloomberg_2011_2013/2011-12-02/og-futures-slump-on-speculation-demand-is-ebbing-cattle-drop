Hog futures fell, capping the first
weekly decline since October, on speculation that demand is
slowing as U.S. retailers may already have filled holiday pork
orders. Cattle also dropped.  Spot-market  hogs slumped 1.3 percent to 83.9 cents a pound
yesterday, the first decline since Nov. 18, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. That’s down 19 percent from $1.0408 on
Aug. 4, the highest since at least 2003, government data show.
Wholesale  pork  fell to 88.21 cents a pound on Nov. 30, the
lowest since June 6, USDA data show.  “The seasonal tendency is to possibly get a little weaker
on pork cutouts from here through the holiday season,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.
in  Minneapolis , said by telephone. “The ham buying may very
well be done to fill up for Christmas and New Year’s.”  Hog futures for February settlement fell 1.2 percent to
settle at 89.225 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Prices dropped 2.8 percent this week, the
first decline since Oct. 28, paring this year’s gain to 12
percent.  Cattle futures for February delivery slipped 0.4 percent to
$1.2325 a pound in Chicago. Earlier, prices reached $1.24675,
the highest since Nov. 17. The commodity has advanced 14 percent
this year.  At midday, wholesale  beef  lost 0.8 percent to $1.9171 a
pound, a three-week low and the sixth straight decline, USDA
data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.7
percent to $1.47075 a pound in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
