Russian oil production slipped 0.1
percent in November from October’s post-Soviet record, failing
to climb for the first time in five months.  Output in the world’s largest crude-producing nation fell
to 10.34 million barrels a day last month, according to
preliminary data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. That
is a 1 percent increase from November last year.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , who may return as president
in the March election, has called for oil output, Russia’s
largest source of tax income, to remain above 10 million barrels
for at least the next decade. Putin lowered the  tax  rate on
crude exports on Oct. 1 to spur investment. Production reached
10.35 million barrels a day that month. That is the highest
since Soviet-era output peaked at 11.48 million barrels a day in
1987, according to BP Plc data.  Exports rose to 5.57 million barrels a day in November, an
increase of 5.1 percent from the previous month and 4.3 percent
from a year earlier.  OAO Lukoil  extended declines at Russian fields to 1.69
million barrels a day, the lowest monthly level in seven years,
while remaining the country’s second-biggest producer, according
to CDU-TEK data. That is 0.4 percent less than the previous
month and 5.1 percent down from a year earlier.  OAO TNK-BP, BP Plc’s venture with a group of billionaires,
missed catching up with Lukoil as output fell 0.5 percent from
the previous month to 1.66 million barrels a day. That includes
its half of the OAO Slavneft venture with OAO Gazprom Neft.  Natural-gas output grew 1.7 percent from a year earlier to
2.02 billion cubic meters a day as non-state producers boosted
output.  OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s exporter of the fuel, produced 1.52
billion cubic meters a day, 2.8 percent less than a year
earlier. OAO Novatek, Russia’s second-largest producer, boosted
output 24 percent to 155 million cubic meters a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
