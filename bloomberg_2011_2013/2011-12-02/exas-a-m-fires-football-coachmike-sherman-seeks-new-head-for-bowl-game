Texas A&M University  fired football
coach Mike Sherman seven months before the Aggies move to the
 Southeastern Conference  from the Big 12.  Sherman, 56, took over on Nov. 26, 2007. Previously coach
of the  Green Bay Packers  and an assistant for the Houston Texans
of the National Football League, he led the Aggies to a 6-6
record this season for a 25-25 mark in four seasons.  “He is truly one of the great offensive minds in football,
both collegiate and professional, and I know that he has much to
offer the game of football in the future,” A&M Athletic
Director Bill Byrne said in a statement.  Byrne will talk with assistant coaches today before
deciding on an interim coach for A&M’s bowl game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
