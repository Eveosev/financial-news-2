Turkey  is “sitting on dynamite” in
terms of its consumer loans, Akbank chief executive Ziya Akkurt
said.  Akbank expects “trouble” in consumer loans for the
banking industry, Akkurt said at a meeting of chief executives
in Istanbul today.  Banks should stay liquid, Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS chief
executive Ergun Ozen and Serra Akcaoglu, chief executive of
Citigroup’s Turkish unit, said at the same meeting.  Akbank will continue financing to industry, Akkurt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
