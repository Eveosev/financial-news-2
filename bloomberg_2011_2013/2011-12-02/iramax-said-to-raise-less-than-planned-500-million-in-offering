Miramax, the producer of films such
as “Shakespeare in Love,” raised a less-than-planned $500
million from securities backed by its library of more than 700
films and 14 television series and paid more in the offering
than initially proposed.  Miramax was attempting to raise about $550 million to pay a
dividend of $142 million to owners and to refinance debt taken
on when  Colony Capital LLC  and investor Ron Tutor bought the
 Santa Monica , California-based studio from  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  last
year for $660 million, two people with knowledge of the
situation said last month.  The asset-backed bond offering by Miramax Film NY LLC,
which priced yesterday, included $350 million of BBB rated debt
that yielded 6.3 percent, according to a person familiar with
the deal who declined to be identified without authorization to
discuss the sale. That slice was cut from a planned $400
million, with the yield being raised from guidance of about 6
percent.  The BB rated, $150 million class of the offering was
priced to yield 13 percent, compared with guidance of 10 percent
to 11 percent, the person said.  Barclays Capital  and Jefferies
Group Inc. managed the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
