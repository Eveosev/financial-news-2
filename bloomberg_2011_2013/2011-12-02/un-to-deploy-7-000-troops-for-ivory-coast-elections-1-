The  United Nations mission  in  Ivory
Coast  will deploy about 7,000 troops to ensure security during
parliamentary elections scheduled for Dec. 11, a UN official
said.  Each of the country’s 205 electoral districts will have
voting certified by the organization, Albert Gerard Koenders,
the special representative for the UN secretary-general in Ivory
Coast, told reporters in Abidjan today.  “The parliamentary elections have to be an element of the
reconciliation” in the country, Koenders said. The opposition’s
refusal to participate in the elections is a “sovereign
right,” though some opposition candidates will still run as
independents, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
