South African vehicle sales growth
slowed in November and exports plunged as the debt crisis in
 Europe  threatened to stall the continent’s largest economy.  Sales  climbed 12 percent to 49,499 vehicles from 44,318 in
the same month a year ago, the National Association of
Automobile Manufacturers of  South Africa  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Vehicle sales expanded 19 percent in October
and 30 percent in September.  “The slowdown in the rate of growth in the new vehicle
sales cycle was consistent with the slower economic growth
recorded in the general economy,” it said. “Prospects of
slower global growth, particularly in developed economies, could
impact on industry export sales going forward.”  The economy expanded less than economists estimated in the
third quarter, as government officials slashed forecasts for
growth on increasing concern the European debt crisis may push
the global economy toward another recession.  Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  cut the growth forecast for
2011 to 3.1 percent on Oct. 25 from a previous estimate of 3.4
percent. Gross domestic product expanded 1.4 percent in the
third quarter, little changed from the 1.3 percent annualized
rate in the three months before, the slowest pace in about two
years.  The debt crisis in Europe, which purchases about 30 percent
of the nation’s manufactured goods, may push the regional
economy into a “mild recession,” said European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi .  Exports Slashed  The  Reserve Bank ’s decision to keep the  repurchase rate  at
a 30-year low of 5.5 percent all year has helped support vehicle
sales, the association said.  Passenger-car sales jumped 12 percent to 33,074 in
November, while purchases of light commercial vehicles, such as
pick-up trucks and minivans, also gained 12 percent to 14,125,
Naamsa said.  Exports declined 28 percent to 20,480 vehicles in November
from a year earlier, it said. The association last month reduced
its estimate for shipments this year to 280,000 from a previous
forecast of 300,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
