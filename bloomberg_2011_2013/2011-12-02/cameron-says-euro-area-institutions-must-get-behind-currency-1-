U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said European institutions need to convince markets they will
“defend and protect and promote” the single currency.  “We need the institutions of the  euro zone  to get behind
the currency,” Cameron told reporters after meeting French
President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris today. European Union
countries must begin “grappling with the lack of
competitiveness that some of those economies have got.”  The leaders spent about 75 minutes together in a lunch
discussion that according to Cameron also covered relations with
 Iran  and  Syria  and the handling of Somali pirates. Sarkozy
declined to comment after the talks.  Cameron said yesterday that Britain’s economy would see a
“very steep decline” if the single currency broke up. Having
pledged not to spend money to help troubled euro-area
governments, he has little leverage beyond urging a solution to
the crisis. If that requires a change to EU treaties, he will
come under pressure from his own Conservative lawmakers to
secure the repatriation of powers in return for his cooperation.  The prime minister said while neither of the moves he is
urging require a treaty amendment, “if there is a treaty
change, then I will make sure we further protect and enhance
British interests.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
