Nickel prices had the biggest gain in
almost six weeks as investor optimism on the European and U.S.
economies bolstered prospects for industrial-metal demand.  The  International Monetary Fund  may play a larger role in
solving  Europe ’s debt crisis, and the U.S. unemployment rate in
November unexpectedly dropped to a 32-month low. A gauge of
industrial metals climbed this week after a November slump.  “Nickel’s move today reflects general macroeconomic
trends,”  John Stephenson , who helps manage $2.6 billion at
First Asset Management Inc. in Toronto, said in an e-mail.
Purchases to close out bearish bets also boosted prices, he
said.  Nickel for delivery in three months jumped 5.9 percent to
close at $17,740 a metric ton at 6:56 p.m. on the London Metal
Exchange, the biggest gain since Oct. 24. The price climbed 4.7
percent this week after tumbling 11 percent in November.  The metal has dropped 28 percent this year as global
economic woes eroded demand, while supplies increased.  “The market for nickel is expected to move into surplus
from deficit this quarter, so I am slightly bearish,”
Stephenson said.  An LME  index (LMEX)  of nickel, copper, aluminum, lead, zinc and
tin climbed 7.4 percent this week after slumping 11 percent in
the previous four weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
