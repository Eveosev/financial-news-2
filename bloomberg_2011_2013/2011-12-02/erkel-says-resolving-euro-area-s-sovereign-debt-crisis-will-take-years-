German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
overcoming the euro region’s sovereign debt crisis “is a
process and this process will take years.”  “The government has always made it clear that the debt
crisis can’t be solved at a single stroke and there are no easy
and fast solutions,” Merkel said in a speech in the lower house
of parliament today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
