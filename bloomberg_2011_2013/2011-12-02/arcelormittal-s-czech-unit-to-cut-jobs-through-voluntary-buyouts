ArcelorMittal (MT)  Ostrava, the Czech unit
of the world’s largest steelmaker, said it will cut jobs through
voluntary buyouts and attrition to increase productivity as the
market is going through a “period of uncertainty.”  Employees who choose to leave will receive as many as 24
monthly salaries and access to job counseling, the Ostrava,
Czech Republic-based company said in an e-mailed press release.
The company’s Czech facilities, which employ as many as 9,000,
will continue to operate normally as long as there is market
demand, it said.  The company will reduce staff by as much as 10 percent, or
600 positions, company representative Jan Rafaj told news agency
CTK today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
