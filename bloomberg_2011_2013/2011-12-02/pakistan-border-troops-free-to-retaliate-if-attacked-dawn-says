Pakistan â€™s army chief, General Parvez Ashfaq Kayani, has told his troops they can respond to any
future attacks by NATO or U.S. forces without waiting for orders
from senior officers, the Dawn newspaper  reported .  Kayani directed his soldiers to retaliate against any act
of aggression with full force regardless of the cost and
consequences, the report said, citing a message drafted by
Kayani for troops. NATO helicopters based in  Afghanistan  killed
24 Pakistani soldiers in an attack on border posts Nov. 25. The
U.S.-led force is investigating the incident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
