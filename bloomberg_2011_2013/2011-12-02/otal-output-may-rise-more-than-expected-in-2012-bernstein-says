Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-largest oil
producer, may have higher-than-expected output growth of 4.5
percent next year even without counting oil from  Libya  because
of projects in Angola and  Nigeria , Bernstein Research said.  “Since 2005 Total has consistently missed production
growth targets,” Bernstein analysts said in a report published
today. “We see reasons why growth targets can be met.”  Production growth of 4.5 percent is more than the French
company is targeting. Chief Financial Officer Patrick de la
Chevardiere said last month he is “very confident” output will
be more than 3 percent next year as the Usan project in Nigeria
and Angola LNG start in the first half of the year.  Total has targeted average output growth of 2.5 percent a
year from 2012 to 2015, driven by projects in  Angola  and
Nigeria. The explorer has said it may raise investment to about
$23 billion a year from about $21 billion to pay for new
ventures and that it will drill five frontier exploration wells
in 2011 and the same number in 2012, more than twice last year’s
count in a bid to make discoveries.  “Total can deliver some of the best upstream growth of the
super majors over the next five years but also in 2012,”
according to Bernstein. “This is going to be profitable
production with higher  cash flow  per barrel than the existing
portfolio and 45 percent higher operating profit per barrel.”  Additional output next year will come from Pazflor in
Angola, which will have a plateau of 220,000 barrels a day,
Trinidad and the Islay gas field in the  North Sea , de la
Chevardiere has said. Total has also said the acquisition of a
12 percent stake in OAO Novatek earlier this year will add about
120,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.  Total is expected to add about 30,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day next year from Libya, output that was lost
during the country’s civil war.  Increasingly successful exploration and “exposure to a
tightening LNG market” means that Total could outperform peers
in 2012, said Bernstein.  To contact the reporter on this story:
