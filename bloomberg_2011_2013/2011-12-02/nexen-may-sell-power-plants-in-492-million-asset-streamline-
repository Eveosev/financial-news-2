Nexen Inc. (NXY)  may sell as much as C$500
million ($492 million) of assets, including power plants, to
“streamline” the company’s portfolio, Chief Executive Officer
Marvin Romanow said.  The Canadian oil producer, which has declined 28 percent
this year, is considering asset sales after experiencing
setbacks with oil-sands projects, Romanow said in an interview
today at Bloomberg headquarters in  New York . The company, based
in Calgary, has had slower-than-expected growth from its Long
Lake project in Alberta, he said.  “We have a number of power plants just as a result of them
being attached to facilities that we process oil and gas
through,” he said. “We don’t have to be owners of power plants
given the rest of our opportunities.”  Nexen owns a cogeneration plant that supplies power to its
Long Lake oil-sands project. It co-owns the 120-megawatt,
natural-gas-fueled Balzac power plant with Encana Corp. on the
outskirts of Calgary, Pierre Alvarez, vice president of
corporate relations, said in a phone interview. It also co-owns
the 70.5-megawatt Soderglen wind farm in southwestern Alberta
with Transalta Corp.  Romanow said the company will reduce debt with  cash flow 
from  Inpex Corp. (1605)  and  JGC Corp., (1963)  Tokyo-based energy companies
that agreed to pay more than C$350 million for a stake in
Nexen’s British Columbia gas fields.  Nexen fell 0.6 percent to C$16.08 at the close in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
