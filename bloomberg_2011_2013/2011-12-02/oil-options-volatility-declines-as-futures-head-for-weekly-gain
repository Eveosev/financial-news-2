Oil options volatility dropped as the
underlying futures swung between gains and losses after a U.S.
government report showed U.S. unemployment dropped to a two-year
low in the world’s largest crude-consuming country.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, fell to 33.3 at noon in  New York , from 33.6
yesterday.  Futures headed for a weekly gain as U.S. unemployment
declined to 8.6 percent, the lowest level since March 2009, from
9 percent, the Labor Department said today. Light-vehicle sales
in the U.S. reached their highest pace in more than two years.  “It’s been a good week for economic data here in the U.S.,
everything from car sales to today’s numbers,”  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy, said in a telephone interview.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
