Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s
largest lender, said fourth-quarter profit rose 43 percent,
topping analysts’ estimates, on record earnings from consumer
banking and insurance.  Profit for the period ended Oct. 31 rose to C$1.6 billion
($1.58 billion), or C$1.07 a share, from C$1.12 billion, or 74
cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said today in a
statement. Revenue was little changed at C$6.8 billion.  Royal Bank is the third Canadian lender to beat estimates
as gains from  consumer lending , asset management and insurance
offset a slowdown in investment banking. Canada’s economy
rebounded 3.5 percent in the third quarter on the biggest jump
in exports since 2004.  “Their domestic bank has always been their foundation of
profitability,”  Craig Fehr , an analyst with Edward Jones & Co.
in  St. Louis , said in an interview before earnings. “That’s not
going to change.”  The company said it earned C$1.11 a share from continuing
operations. The bank was expected to earn 97 cents a share
before one-time items, based on the average estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Royal Bank fell 0.5 percent to C$47.03 yesterday in Toronto
trading. The stock has fallen 10 percent this year, compared
with a 6.7 percent decline for the eight-company  S&P/TSX
Commercial Banks Index .  Beat Estimates  Canadian banking profit rose 18 percent to C$904 million as
home-equity loans, personal and business deposits and business
loans grew. Overall loan-loss provisions fell 17 percent.  Wealth-management earnings rose 8 percent to C$189 million,
while insurance profit surged 58 percent to C$196 million from a
year earlier, when profit was pared by a C$116 million loss on
the sale of the bank’s Liberty Life Insurance Co. business.  Profit from the RBC Capital Markets  investment-banking 
business fell 25 percent to C$278 million, on lower fixed-income
trading due to “challenging” market conditions.  “The thumb of  Europe  has really been pressing on Royal
Bank the hardest, largely because they are so sensitive to the
capital markets businesses and trading more so than other
banks,” said Fehr.  Trading revenue across the bank fell by more than half to
C$279 million, led by a decline in trading of interest rate and
credit.  Global Banking  International banking profit, including Caribbean banking
and its RBC Dexia partnership and excluding the U.S. RBC Bank
that’s being sold, was C$12 million, compared with a C$7 million
loss a year earlier.  Royal Bank said profit from continuing operations, which
excludes the U.S. consumer bank, rose 19 percent to C$1.63
billion, or C$1.09 a share, from a year earlier.  For the year, Royal Bank said it earned C$4.85 billion, or
C$3.19 a share, down from C$5.22 billion, or C$3.46, in fiscal
2010.  Bank of  Nova Scotia  is also scheduled to report today.  Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce posted earnings yesterday that beat analysts’
estimates.  (Royal Bank will hold a conference call to discuss fourth-
