Manroland AG, the German printing-
machinery maker that filed for insolvency on Nov. 25, secured a
so-called mass credit for 55 million euros ($74 million) to
continue operations.  “The company can continue to do business with customers
and suppliers, and we are sending a very positive signal to the
market,” Werner Schneider, the manufacturer’s provisional
insolvency administrator, said in a  statement  today.  The move is the second step to help Manroland stay in
business following an agreement for  Germany ’s Federal Labor
Agency to pay the company’s wages, Thomas Hauser, a spokesman at
the Offenbach-based printing-machine maker, said by telephone.
The transfer is expected to take place today, he said.  Manroland, majority-owned by insurance company  Allianz SE (ALV) ,
employs 6,500 people, including 5,000 in Germany, the
manufacturer said when it  announced  the insolvency filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
