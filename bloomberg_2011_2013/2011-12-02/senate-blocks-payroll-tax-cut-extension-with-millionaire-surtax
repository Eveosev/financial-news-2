The  U.S. Senate  rejected a Democratic
proposal to extend a payroll  tax cut  to 2012 for workers and
cover the cost by imposing a 3.25 percent surtax on individual
income exceeding $1 million a year.  Tonight’s 51-49 vote fell short of the 60 votes that were
needed to advance the legislation. The tax cut, which lowered a
worker’s share of the Social Security payroll tax from 6.2
percent to 4.2 percent for 2011, is slated to expire Dec. 31
unless Congress acts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
