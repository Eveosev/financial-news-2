Societe Generale SA (GLE) ’s Serbian unit
will provide loans of about 200 million euros ($270 million)
next year to local households and businesses, said Antoine
Toussaint, the chief executive of the Serbian unit.  The 2012 lending plan is a 15 percent increase in
credit activity from this year, pushing the bank’s total loan
portfolio in the Balkan nation to 1.5 billion euros, he said
today at a news conference in Belgrade. A 70 million-euro
capital boost at the unit has begun, he said.  Societe Generale’s Serbian unit saw a 15 percent increase
in corporate lending in the first nine months of this year and a
20 percent increase in lending to households, Toussaint said.
