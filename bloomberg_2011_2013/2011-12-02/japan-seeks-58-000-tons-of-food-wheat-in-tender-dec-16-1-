Japan  is seeking 58,000 metric tons
of food wheat and 46,000 tons of barley Dec. 16 through a tender
system introduced to loosen government grain-import controls,
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Shipment must be made by Feb. 10, Masafumi Otsuka at the
ministryâ€™s grain-trade division said today by phone. Of the
total barley, 10,000 tons is for beer production and the
remaining volume is for  food production , he said.  The tender will be held under the so-called simultaneous
buy-and-sell system, in which food makers and trading companies
jointly bid for grains of any origin and quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
