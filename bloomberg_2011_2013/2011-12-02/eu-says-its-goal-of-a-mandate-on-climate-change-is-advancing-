The European Union’s request for a
mandate to work on a legally binding treaty on  climate change  is
gaining support at United Nations talks, said Tomasz Chruszczow,
the minister from Poland whose nation holds the bloc’s rotating
presidency.  “This goal is advancing,” he said at a press conference
today in Durban,  South Africa . “Many countries see the goal of
keeping the warming to 2 degrees requires a good action. Many
parties can see that waiting until 2015 or longer to start
discussing the next steps will simply be too late. This process
takes time.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
