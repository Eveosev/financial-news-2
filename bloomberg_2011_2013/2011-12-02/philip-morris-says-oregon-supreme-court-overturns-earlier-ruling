Altria Group Inc. (MO) ’s Philip Morris USA
must pay $47.7 million to Oregon, the state’s Supreme Court
ruled, rejecting arguments from the biggest U.S. cigarette maker
that the tobacco industry’s landmark 1998 settlement with 46
states barred the recovery.  The Oregon Supreme Court decided yesterday that Philip
Morris, a unit of Richmond, Virginia-based Altria, must pay the
state 60 percent of a $79.5 million punitive damages award, plus
interest, in a smoking-related wrongful death claim.  A jury in 1999 awarded that amount, in addition to
compensatory damages, to the estate of Jesse Williams, a smoker
who had died of  lung cancer . An Oregon law cited in the court’s
ruling requires that 60 percent of punitive damages awards go to
the state.  Philip Morris  claimed the state released its claim by
signing the $206 billion multistate settlement agreement
resolving health care cost-recovery lawsuits against U.S.
cigarette makers.  “We believe that the Oregon Supreme Court misapplied the
law and reached an erroneous result,” said  Murray Garnick ,
Altria Client Services senior vice president and associate
general counsel. “As the lower court recognized, the state
released its claims to any punitive damages when it signed the
Master Settlement Agreement.”  The case is Williams v. R.J. Reynolds, SC S059014, Oregon
Supreme Court (Salem).  To contact the reporter on this story:
