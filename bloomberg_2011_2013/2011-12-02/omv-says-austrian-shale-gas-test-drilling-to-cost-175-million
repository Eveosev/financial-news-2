OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest oil
company, said that two test drillings for shale gas in  Austria 
would cost about 130 million euros ($175 million), according to
Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss.  The company, based in Vienna, plans to carry out the
drilling in the next 12 to 24 months, Roiss told reporters in
the Austrian capital today.  OMV announced last month that a recent geological study has
show shale gas reserves in the Province of Lower Austria. The
study suggests that the reserves are big enough to cover
Austria’s annual natural-gas needs for 20 to 30 years, Roiss
said today, adding that Austria requires 8 billion cubic meters
a year.  The likelihood of drilling success is a 20 percent, Roiss
said, adding that that the company wants to pursue “clean shale
gas.”  “Only if we are able to go an ecologically sensible,
justifiable way, that is economically viable, will we go into
production,” the CEO said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
