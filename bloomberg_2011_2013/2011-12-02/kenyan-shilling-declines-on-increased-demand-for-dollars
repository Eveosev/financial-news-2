Kenya ’s shilling, the world’s best-
performing currency against the dollar over the past month,
depreciated today on increased demand for dollars.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy declined as
much as 0.5 percent to 90.20 before trading 0.2 percent lower at
89.90 at 2:13 p.m. in Nairobi, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has added 10 percent since Nov. 1,
making it the best performer worldwide against the dollar among
more than 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The Kenyan central bank raised its benchmark  interest rate 
by 1.5 percentage points to 18 percent to contain inflation
after prices surged more than double the government’s target.
The worst regional drought in 60 years and higher fuel prices
helped spurr inflation to 19.7 percent in November from 18.9
percent in the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics
said Nov.29.  “The weakening is largely due to the fact that there is
demand for dollars by businesses and the market had already
factored in a potential rise of the benchmark by the central
bank,” Wilson Mutai a dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking
Corp., said in a phone interview today.  The Tanzanian shilling strengthened for the second day in
three, gaining 0.6 percent to trade at 1,671 per dollar while
the  Uganda ’s currency gained for the fifth day, rising 0.4
percent to 2,525 per dollar.  Editors: Ana Monteiro, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
