Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , Canada’s largest oil
pipeline operator, has signed agreements with some of the native
groups living along the route of its proposed Northern Gateway
bitumen pipeline, Vice President Janet Holder said.  Enbridge is negotiating with 50 groups along the route to
Kitimat, British Columbia, on the Pacific coast, from  Alberta ,
Holder said today during a conference call. She declined to
identify the native groups or say how many have given their
consent.  Enbridge, based in Calgary, is proposing to build a twin
pipeline system between Alberta and the coast of British Columbia
to transport crude from oil-sands projects. The pipeline, which
would be mostly underground, would carry 525,000 barrels a day of
crude to  Canada ’s West Coast and bring back liquids to dilute
petroleum products for shipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
