Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
producer of the sweetener, dropped to its 2 1/2-year low on
capacity concerns.  The stock fell 5.2 percent to 4.60 shillings by the 3:00
p.m. close, retreating for a fifth day. That’s the weakest since
June 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We have seen cane supply dwindling so much, the company’s
operating capacity may drop from 75 percent now to even 60
percent before the end of the financial year in June,” Deris
Mogoi, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
