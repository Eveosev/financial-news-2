Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  and  Japan ’s
trade and industry ministry considered exiting planned nuclear
fuel reprocessing operations at the Rokkasho plant because of
cost overruns, the Mainichi newspaper reported.  Officials from Tokyo Electric and the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry met in 2002 to discuss shutting down
operations at Rokkasho in northern Honshu after construction
costs were projected to be more than 2 trillion yen ($25.7
billion), the newspaper reported, citing a memo on the meeting.  Further meetings on proposals to abandon reprocessing
weren’t held because Tokyo Electric Chairman Hiroshi Araki and
President Nobuya Minami stepped down to take responsibility for
fake safety reports at the company’s plants later in 2002.  The revelation that recycling at the Rokkasho plant was
targeted for closure may affect a debate on the future of the
Monju fast-breeder reactor northwest of  Tokyo , the Mainichi
said. The Rokkasho site is also a storage facility for waste
from nuclear plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
