Italy’s state-backed lender Cassa
Depositi e Prestiti SpA may guarantee banking foundations in
renegotiating their loans,  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti  is working on the proposal which
may be discussed by the Cabinet next week, the newspaper said.
The move aims to help the foundations, among the main investors
in Italian lenders, in renegotiating loans contracted to back
share sales by banks, according to Il Sole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
