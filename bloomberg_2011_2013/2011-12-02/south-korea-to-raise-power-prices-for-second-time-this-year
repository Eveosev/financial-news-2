South Korea  will raise electricity
prices by an average 4.5 percent this month, the second increase
this year, to help the country’s monopoly power distributor
cover higher fuel costs.  The price increases by  Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  will take
effect from Dec. 5, the Knowledge Economy  ministry  said today in
an e-mailed statement. The state-controlled utility known as
Kepco advanced 1.4 percent at 12:10 p.m. in Seoul trading,
before the ministry’s statement.  Power tariffs for industrial plants and buildings will
increase 6.5 percent, while those for households and farms will
be unchanged, the ministry said. The cost for education
facilities will climb 4.5 percent.  The rise, which follows a 4.9 percent increase in August,
will enable  Kepco (015760)  to cover 87 percent of power generating costs,
the ministry said. Kepco posted a 1.94 trillion won ($1.7
billion) net loss in the first nine months of this year.  South Korea’s government plans to impose progressive
tariffs on winter peak times, asking large factories and
buildings to reduce electricity use by 10 percent in the period,
according to another statement from the ministry.  Electricity consumption increased 31 percent in the six
years to 2010, compared with declines of 1.9 percent in  Japan 
and 5.1 percent in the U.K., according to the ministry.  The higher tariffs will add 0.116 percentage point a year
to the producer price index, and boost costs by 0.0076
percentage point at manufacturers, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
