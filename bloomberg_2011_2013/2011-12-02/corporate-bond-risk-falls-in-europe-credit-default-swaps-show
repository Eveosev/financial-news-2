The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and financial debt fell, heading for the
biggest-ever weekly decline and the first drop in five weeks.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell seven basis points to 327
at 9:30 a.m. in London. The gauge is down from 385 basis points
Nov. 25, signaling improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The  Markit iTraxx Financial Index  linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell for a fifth day, declining eight
basis points today to 288.5, compared with 358 basis points last
week. The subordinated gauge fell 14 basis points today to 501,
and was 615 last week.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 18 basis
points to 737.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Markit
iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade
ratings was down five basis points at 178.25.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
