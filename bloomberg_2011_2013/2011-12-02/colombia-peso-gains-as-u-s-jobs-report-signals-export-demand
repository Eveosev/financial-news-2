Colombia ’s peso gained after the U.S.
jobless rate dropped, a sign that growth in the world’s biggest
economy is picking up and will bolster demand for the South
American country’s exports.  The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 1,939.2 per dollar at 9:56
a.m. in Bogota, from 1,946.3 yesterday. It has gained 1 percent
over the past five days, its first weekly advance in three.  “The U.S. unemployment rate will help Colombia maintain
its export takeoff,” said Wilson Tovar, analyst at Acciones y
Valores SA. “Together with the holiday sales, it creates some
calm that allows investors to take more risks.”  Payroll gains in the U.S. picked up last month and the
jobless rate unexpectedly fell to the lowest level since March
2009, a decline augmented by the departure of Americans from the
 labor force .  Colombian sales in the U.S., which account for 42 percent
of the country’s exports, grew 29 percent this year through
September compared to the same period last year, according to
Colombia’s statistics agency.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 rose 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.59
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
