U.S.-listed Chinese stocks headed
toward their biggest weekly gain in two years after  China 
reduced its reserve requirements for banks and policy makers
moved to contain the  European debt crisis .  The Bloomberg China-US 55  Index (HSCEI)  fell 0.5 percent to 100.54

percent, still the biggest since October 2009.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , the
nation’s largest offshore oil producer, jumped 12 percent this
week to $193.12.  Baidu Inc., (BIDU)  the owner of China’s most popular
online search engine, also advanced 12 percent to $134.40.  China’s central bank on Nov. 30 reduced the amount of cash
that banks must set aside as reserves for the first time since
2008. The same day, the Federal Reserve and five other central
banks cut the costs of emergency dollar funding to European
lenders to alleviate a credit crunch. The U.S. Labor Department
said the jobless rate unexpectedly fell last month to the lowest
level since March 2009.  “Policy easing is bullish for all Chinese companies,”
Eric M. Jackson, president and founder of Ironfire Capital, said
in a telephone interview. “It is particularly good for property
developers and trickles down to the rest of the economy. There’s
gradual improvement in the U.S. economy.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.8 percent this week to
2,360.664, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises  Index (SPX)  rallied
10 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has jumped 7.9

week to 9.2 percent. Deutsche Bank AG raised its rating for Sina

$94.80.  China’s policy makers acted to provide more liquidity to
the system to shore up economic growth as the property market
cooled and the European crisis eroded exports. A report this
week showed manufacturing contracted last month for the first
time since February 2009.  Chinese financial companies and commodity producers will
benefit most from a potential cyclical rebound in the economy,
