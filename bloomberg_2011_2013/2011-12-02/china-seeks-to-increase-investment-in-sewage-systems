China  seeks to increase public and
private investment into its city sewage and drainage systems,
and has proposed rules to improve wastewater sanitation, the
State Council said in a statement on its website today.  Individuals and companies will have to have suitable
drainage facilities, the State Council said in a draft proposal
of rules. Restaurants, construction sites and hospitals will
have to have government sewage-emission permits, it said.  Rules are needed because problems in Chinaâ€™s waste
treatment and drainage systems persist, even after major
improvements in recent years, the Cabinet said. Violators of the
rules will face fines of as much as 3 million yuan ($472,000),
the official Xinhua News Agency reported today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
