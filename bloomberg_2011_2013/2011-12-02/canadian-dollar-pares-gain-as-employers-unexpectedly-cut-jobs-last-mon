The Canadian dollar dropped for the
first time in seven days after a government report showed
employers unexpectedly reduced jobs in November.  The nation’s currency still registered its biggest five-day
gain since October on a European proposal to channel loans
through the  International Monetary Fund  and as central banks
including the Bank of  Canada  acted Nov. 30 to make it cheaper
for lenders to borrow in dollars.  “Jobs data disappointed in terms of the headline figure,”
 Stewart Hall , senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada, said in a telephone interview from Toronto. “We’re left
with the residue of earlier events from this week that put a bid
into the risk story and by extension into the Canadian dollar.”  The loonie, as the currency is also known, depreciated 0.6
percent to C$1.0195 per  U.S. dollar  by 5 p.m. Toronto time after
earlier gaining 0.6 percent. One Canadian dollar buys 98.09 U.S.
cents.  The Canadian currency advanced 2.7 percent this week
against the greenback, the most since a 2.9 percent climb in the
five days ended Oct. 14. The loonie rose earlier today to
C$1.0080, the strongest level since Nov. 14.  Canadian  jobs  fell by a net 18,600 last month, following
October’s drop of 54,000,  Statistics Canada  said today in
Ottawa. The  unemployment rate  rose for a second straight month,
increasing to 7.4 percent from 7.3 percent.  October Jobs Report  The loonie slid 1.2 percent on Nov. 4 after the statistics
agency reported that Canada’s economy lost the most jobs in
October since the 2009 recession.  Yields  on 10-year Government of Canada bonds dropped two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.11 percent. The
price of the 3.25 percent securities maturing in June 2021
increased 18 cents to C$109.73.  The U.S. jobless rate fell to 8.6 percent, the lowest level
since March 2009, from 9 percent, Labor Department figures
showed today. Payrolls climbed by 120,000, with more than half
the hiring coming from retailers and temporary-help agencies,
and a revised 100,000 advance in October was more than initially
estimated. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a gain of 125,000.  A European proposal to channel central bank loans through
the IMF may deliver as much as 200 billion euros ($270 billion)
to fight the debt crisis, two people familiar with the
negotiations said.  At a Nov. 29 meeting attended by European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi , euro-area finance ministers gave the go-
ahead for work on the plan, said the people, who declined to be
named because the talks are at an early stage.  “There’s a little bit of optimism on  Europe ,” Kit Juckes,
head of foreign-exchange strategy at Societe Generale SA in
 London , said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
