Indonesia ’s  inflation  may accelerate
to as much as 5 percent next year as Southeast Asia’s largest
economy expands, according to Deputy Governor  Bank Indonesia 
Halim Alamsyah.  Consumer prices may climb 4.5 percent to 5 percent in 2012
from a possible 4 percent or less this year, Alamsyah said in an
interview in Nusa Dua, Bali, today. The economy may be supported
by a return of capital flows, and investors from Japan and China
relocating some of their industries into Indonesia, he said.  The estimate doesn’t take into account the impact of any
“policy to increase the price of administered prices, like
fuel,” he said. “Although, if those happen we’ve already
counted that the impact won’t be significant.”  Slowing inflation in recent months allowed  Bank Indonesia 
to cut  interest rates  by half a percentage point to 6 percent on
Nov. 10, as Asian nations from Thailand to the Philippines try
to shield their economies from the impact of the European debt
crisis. Still, a falling currency, which has lost more than 5
percent in the past three months, may push up imported inflation.  The rupiah’s decline has been a “healthy correction” as
it hasn’t been too strong or too weak among Asian currencies,
Alamsyah said.  Indonesia’s foreign reserves may gain to $130 billion next
year, after missing a previous target of $116 billion for the
end of this year, he said. “With the latest prolonged crisis in
 Europe , I think it won’t meet our previous prediction,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
