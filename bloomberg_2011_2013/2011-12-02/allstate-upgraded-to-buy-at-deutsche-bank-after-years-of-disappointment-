Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the auto and home
insurer whose stock has dropped by almost half since the end of
2007, was recommended to investors by Josh Shanker of  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) , who said “the bar is exceedingly low” for gains.  “The last four years have been extremely challenging for
Allstate,” Shanker said today in a research report. “These
difficult years are weighing on the stock, having now brought it
to a valuation --- both intrinsic as well as relative to its
peers -- where it can be viewed as attractive.” Shanker raised
his rating on the Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer to “buy”
from “hold.”  Allstate is the  second-worst (S5PROP)  performing stock in the eight-
company Standard & Poor’s 500 Property & Casualty Insurance
Index over the last four years, falling 48 percent. XL Group Plc
has dropped 65 percent. Allstate, led by Chief Executive Officer
 Thomas Wilson , 54, posted investment losses during the 2008
credit crunch and has faced costs this year tied to natural
disasters.  “The outlook and share price for the company’s stock looks
to have reached a bottom and seems overdone,” said Shanker, who
titled one section of his report “Looking at the Past: Four
Years of Disappointment.”  Allstate rose 12 cents to $26.68 at 4 p.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
