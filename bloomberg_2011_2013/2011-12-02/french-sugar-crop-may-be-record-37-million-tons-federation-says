The French sugar crop may be a record
37 million metric tons in 2012-12, assuming beets contain 16
percent sugar, the country’s beet-growers federation CGB said.  Sugar produced from each hectare (2.47 acres) will increase
11 percent to 14 metric tons from 12.6 tons a year earlier,
Alain Jeanroy, the CGB’s director general, said at a press
conference in Paris today. Last year’s crop was estimated at 33
million tons.  France  is the largest grower of sugar beets.  An early start to harvesting means French sugar factories
will be able to operate a record 110 days before they run out
of beets, boosting profitability, Jeanroy said. Two-thirds of
this year’s beet harvest has been processed to date, he said.  The trend for world sugar prices in the first quarter will
be “down or stable,” according to Jeanroy. White sugar should
continue to trade in a range of 400 to 500 euros ($540 to $675)
a ton in the first half, he said.  White sugar futures have declined 15 percent in  London  in
the past 12 months to $614.80 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
