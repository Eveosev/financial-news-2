Hong Kong   stocks (HSI)  rose, reversing
earlier losses, as Chinese financial companies extended gains,
offsetting declines among exporters.  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  and Ping An Insurance Group Co. led the
advance among Chinese financial companies on speculation the
industry will benefit from government moves to ease lending
curbs and stimulate the economy.  Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings
Ltd. (551) , a Nike Inc. shoe supplier that gets about 30 percent of
sales from the U.S., fell 1.3 percent after an unexpected rise
in the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits.  “A lot of the potential downside has been priced in,”
said  Andrew Sullivan , principal sales trader at Piper Jaffray
Asia Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Its hard to tell whether
valuations have reached the trough until we know what’s going on
in  Europe .”  The Hang Seng Index gained 0.2 percent to 19,040.39 as of
the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong, erasing losses of as much as 0.7
percent. The measure advanced 7.6 percent this week as  China 
lowered  reserve requirements  and the  Federal Reserve  led five
other central banks in cutting the cost of emergency funding for
European lenders. The gauge plunged 9.4 percent in November.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
listed in Hong Kong advanced 0.7 percent to 10,350.51 after
surging yesterday by the most since December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
