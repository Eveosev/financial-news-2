Peruvian benchmark bonds headed for
their longest winning streak since October as an unexpected drop
in the U.S. jobless rate fueled optimism the world’s biggest
economy will avoid recession.  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due August 2020 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 5.64 percent at 10:50 a.m. Lima time, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The yield has fallen for six
straight days, the longest streak since the period ending Oct.
14. The security’s price rose 0.2 centimo to 114.87 centimos per
sol.  Payroll gains in the U.S. rose last month and the jobless
rate unexpectedly fell to the lowest level since March 2009,
allaying concern the U.S. deficit and  Europe ’s debt crisis may
lead the economy to stall.  “The better economic data and the fact there hasn’t been
any bad news out of Europe has boosted demand for risk,” said
Diego Alvarez, a fixed-income trader at Banco Internacional del
 Peru . Bets the Peruvian sol will extend gains spurred purchases
of sol-denominated bonds by overseas investors, he said.  The central bank bought $326 million in the  spot market 
yesterday to slow the sol’s advance after the currency touched
its highest level since April 2008.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6990 per dollar in trading
today, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
