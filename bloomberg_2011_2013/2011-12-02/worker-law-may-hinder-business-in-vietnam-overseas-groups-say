A new Vietnamese law on foreign
workers may hurt investment and fail to meet trade agreements
signed by the Southeast Asian nation, including its pact with
the  World Trade Organization , overseas business groups said.  The legislation, known as Decree 46, outlines stricter
measures, including a provision that in order for a foreigner’s
work permit to be extended, overseas companies must nominate a
local apprentice who’s expected to replace that foreign worker.
It should come into effect Dec. 18, according to a copy of the
circular implementing the law posted on a government website.  The law may “constitute a violation of Vietnam’s WTO
schedule of Specific Commitments in Services” the European
Chamber of Commerce said in a paper distributed at a forum with
ministers in  Hanoi  today.  Pledged foreign direct investment in Vietnam fell 16
percent through November from a year ago, according to the
Foreign Investment Agency. Le Quang Trung, deputy head of the
employment department at the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and
Social Affairs, told the forum that the business groups’
concerns were acknowledged and the law may be clarified.  “Few investors disagree that  Vietnam  has huge potential,”
the American Chamber of Commerce said in the conclusion of its
position paper at the forum. “However, the country is
struggling to live up to its full potential, hindered by slow
progress on a list of perennial barriers to investment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
