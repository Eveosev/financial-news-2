Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  said
 Commercial Metals Co. (CMC)  has until 9 a.m. New York time on Dec. 5
to respond to his unsolicited $1.73 billion takeover offer
before  Icahn Enterprises (IEP)  LP will “take matters into our own
hands.”  “Shareholders deserve an answer,” Icahn wrote in a letter
released today. “It is incumbent on this board to respond to
our offer.”  Icahn Enterprises, which holds a 10 percent stake in the
company, offered $15 apiece for the rest of the shares without
any financing or due diligence conditions, according to a Nov.
28 letter to Commercial Metals’ board. The offer is 31 percent
more than the stock closing price on Nov. 25, the last trading
day before the bid was announced.  Icahn didn’t immediately respond to a telephone message
seeking comment. Chris Kittredge, a Commercial Metals spokesman
who works for Sard Verbinnen & Co., also wasn’t immediately
available.  Commercial Metals, based in Irving,  Texas , collects scrap
that it melts to make products such as steel rebar used in
construction. The company, which also distributes steel, has
operations in the U.S., Poland and  Croatia . Icahn has said he
would sell “non-core” assets, appoint a new management team
and combine Commercial Metals with his existing metals-recycling
assets.  Board Members  Icahn plans to nominate three board members at CMC’s next
annual shareholder meeting on Feb. 3, challenging the chief
executive officer’s position on the board. Icahn, 75, who often
buys distressed companies, started his metals business through
the acquisition of Philip Services Corp., a bankrupt Canadian
scrap metals and industrial services company, in 2004.  Commercial Metals said on Nov. 28 that Icahn’s initial
letter proposing the takeover didn’t “constitute a formal
offer.”  Commercial Metals rose 0.6 percent to $13.99 at the close
in  New York . The shares have gained 22 percent since Icahn’s bid
was announced.  Icahn Capital LP, the financier’s hedge fund, disclosed in
July that it paid almost $101 million to acquire a 10 percent
stake comprised of shares and options in Commercial Metals.  The value of the CMC deal is calculated based on the 115.5
million shares that are outstanding according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
