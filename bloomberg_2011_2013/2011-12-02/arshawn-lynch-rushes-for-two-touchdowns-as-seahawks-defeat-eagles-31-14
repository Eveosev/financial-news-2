Marshawn Lynch rushed for two
touchdowns and David Hawthorne returned an interception 77 yards
for a score as the  Seattle Seahawks  beat the Philadelphia Eagles
31-14.  The Seahawks improved to 5-7 with their third win in four
games, while the Eagles, playing without starting quarterback
 Michael Vick , fell to 4-8 with their fourth defeat in five
National Football League starts.  Lynch carried 22 times for 148 yards, his best performance
since he ran for a career high 153 yards on Nov. 4, 2007. His
touchdown runs of 15 yards and 40 yards gave the Seahawks a 14-0
lead 10 seconds into the second quarter last night at
CenturyLink Field in Seattle.  “He’s so aggressive on the field,” Seahawks coach  Pete Carroll  said in a televised interview. “He’s so much of the
attack. He’s been on fire.”  LeSean McCoy scored the first of his two touchdowns three
minutes later for the Eagles before Steven Hauschka kicked a 49-
yard field goal to make it 17-7 to  Seattle  at halftime.  “I take my hat off to the offensive line; they got it
done,” Seattle quarterback  Tarvaris Jackson  said in a televised
interview. “We ran the ball well, the defense was great. We
didn’t turn over the ball.”  Jackson fired an 11-yard pass to Golden Tate to give the
Seahawks a 24-7 lead in the third quarter. The quarterback
completed 13 of 16 passing attempts for 190 yards and one
touchdown.  McCoy scored his second touchdown two minutes into the
fourth quarter on a 2-yard pass from  Vince Young  as the Eagles
narrowed the gap to 24-14.  Four Interceptions  Hawthorne completed the scoring with 4:24 left in the game
when Young gave up the third of a career-high four interceptions.
The Seahawks converted the turnovers into 21 points, while Young
completed 17 of 29 passing attempts for 208 yards.  “We’re pros, things happen,” Young said. “We don’t point
fingers at anybody. We still have a season going on. Anything
can happen.”  Vick has missed three Eagles games with two broken ribs.  “I can’t complain about the effort or work ethic they put
forth,” Philadelphia coach  Andy Reid  said in a televised news
conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
