Union Pacific Corp. (UNP) , the largest U.S.
carrier by revenue, righted five derailed railway cars carrying
crude oil in  Louisiana .  No oil spilled after the incident on a side track south of
Monroe at 3:22 p.m. local time yesterday, Raquel Espinoza, a
spokeswoman for Union Pacific, said in an e-mail. There were no
injuries and the cause is being investigated, she said.  The train of two locomotives and 65 crude cars was bound
for the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve terminal in St. James,
Louisiana, she said.  The train was originally run by  Burlington Northern Santa
Fe LLC . Espinoza couldnâ€™t immediately say where the train began
its trip.  To contact the reporter on this story:
