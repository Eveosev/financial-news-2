Following is the text of
 Canada 's labor force survey released by Statistics 
Canada.  Following a notable decrease the previous month,
employment edged down 19,000 in November, and the
unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points to 7.4%.
Despite the recent declines, employment was up 1.2%
(+212,000) from 12 months earlier.  Employment  A decline of 53,000 in part-time work was partially
offset by an increase of 35,000 in full-time. Compared
with a year earlier, the number of part-time workers was
down 1.9% (-62,000), while full-time employment grew by
2.0% (+274,000). Over the same period, the total number of
hours worked increased at the same rate as total
employment (+1.2%).  Employment declined in  Quebec  and Saskatchewan in
November, while it increased in  Nova Scotia . There was
little change in the other provinces.  In November, there were employment losses in retail and
wholesale trade, as well as business, building and other
support services. These losses were partially offset by
increases in "other services" (such as personal services
and repair and maintenance), as well as in construction;
natural resources; and utilities.  There were fewer self-employed workers in November 
(-28,000). Compared with a year earlier, most of the
employment growth was among private sector employees
(+1.9%), as employment was little changed among public
sector employees (+0.4%) and the self-employed (-0.3%).  Employment declined among core-aged men and youths,
while there were gains among women aged 55 and over.  Unemployment  Losses in services partly offset by increases in goods
sector  Employment in the service sector declined in November,
with decreases in retail and wholesale trade (-34,000) as
well as in business, building and other support services 
(-29,000). At the same time, there were employment gains of
36,000 in "other services" such as personal services and
repair and maintenance.  Despite the decline in November, employment in the
service sector rose by 1.3% over the past 12 months, with
steady increases in accommodation and food services
(+6.5%) as well as professional, scientific and technical
services (+5.1%).  In November, there were more workers in the goods
sector, with gains in construction (+20,000); natural
resources (+10,000); and utilities (+8,000).  In the 12 months to November, employment in the goods
sector increased 0.8%. Over the period, there was notable
growth in natural resources (+8.3%) and construction
(+2.2%). In manufacturing, employment was slightly below
its level of 12 months earlier (-0.8%).  Employment declines in Quebec and Saskatchewan  Employment in Quebec fell by 31,000 in November,
pushing the  unemployment rate  up 0.3 percentage points to
8.0%. The bulk of the decline was in wholesale and retail
trade. This month's decrease leaves employment in the
province at about the same level as November 2010.  The only other province with a notable employment
decrease in November was Saskatchewan (-4,200). This
pushed the unemployment rate in the province up by a full
percentage point to 5.1%. With this month's decline,
employment in Saskatchewan was similar to its level one
year earlier.  In November, employment increased by 4,400 in Nova
Scotia. Despite this increase, the unemployment rate in
the province was unchanged at 8.6%, as more people were
participating in the labour market.  Following a large decline in October, employment in
Ontario edged up by 17,000 in November. At the same time,
the unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage points to
7.9%. Over the past 12 months, employment in the province
has grown by 1.5% (+97,000), slightly higher than the
national average of 1.2%.  Employment in Alberta edged up in November, and the
unemployment rate was 5.0%. Compared with November 2010,
employment grew faster in Alberta than in any other
province, at 4.8%.  Employment declines among core-aged men and youths  In November, employment declined by 20,000 among core-
aged men (25 to 54), leaving employment for this group
slightly above its level of 12 months earlier (+0.5%).
Among core-aged women, while little changed in November,
employment grew 1.3% over the past 12 months.  Employment also fell in November among youths aged 15
to 24 (-18,000). Compared with one year earlier, however,
youth employment was up 1.3%.  There were more women aged 55 and over working in
November (+20,000), bringing total growth for this group
to 2.1% over the past 12 months. For men in the same age
group, despite little change in November, employment
increased by 2.9% over the past 12 months.  Note to readers  Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample, and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will
have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates, and how to use standard errors
to assess this variability, consult the "Data quality"
section of the publication Labour Force Information (71-
001-X, free).  Statistics Canada  is moving to one release time, 8:30
a.m., for all data releases in The Daily. This will mean a
change in the release time for the LFS, which is currently
7:00 a.m. This change will be implemented with the release
of LFS data on April 5, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
