Bonds of  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  climbed
for the fourth day this week as confidence in the broker-dealer
recovers from a selloff sparked by the October collapse of MF
Global Holdings Ltd.  The $550 million of 6.875 percent notes due in April 2021
rose 2.25 cents to 87.25 cents on the dollar as of 10:30 a.m. in
New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities have
climbed from 75 cents on Nov. 17, after a 25-cent drop over
three weeks. The debt, which yields 8.9 percent, is trading at
the highest price since Nov. 14, Trace data show.  Its debt has recovered from distressed levels as Chief
Executive Officer  Richard Handler  seeks to reassure investors
that the New York-based firm doesn’t face the types of leveraged
and concentrated risks that forced MF Global into bankruptcy.
That firm failed when investors lost confidence in its ability
to manage a $6.3 billion bet on European sovereign debt.  Jefferies said twice last month that it cut its gross
exposure to  Greece , Ireland,  Italy , Portugal and  Spain  and said,
when accounting for hedges, it was net short $134 million,
meaning overall it would gain as the debt deteriorated.  Its debt and equity also rose this week after an
Oppenheimer & Co. analyst said that a report from Egan-Jones
Ratings Co. that noted Jefferies should raise $1 billion in
equity and reduce leverage contained errors.  Kohlberg, Miramax Deals  “Our report stands on its own,”  Sean Egan , president of
Egan-Jones, said Nov. 28 on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness
with Margaret Brennan” in response to comments from Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer.  Jefferies was the most active manager of speculative-grade
debt sold this week, arranging $290 million of the $1.04 billion
issued. That included a $175 million bond offering by Optima
Specialty Steel Inc., the steel producer buying Kohlberg & Co.
LLC’s Niagara LaSalle Corp.  Jefferies also helped manage with  Barclays Capital  a debt
sale by film producer Miramax that raised $500 million from
securities backed by its library of more than 700 films and 14
television series.  It rose $1.10, or 9.7 percent, to $12.40 at 4:15 p.m.  New
York  time, after climbing from $10.65 on Nov. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
