Nice Systems Ltd., (NICE)  an Israeli company
that provides analytical tools for recording service
transactions, agreed to buy Merced Systems Inc. for about $150
million to expand its offerings.  The acquisition of Redwood Shores, California-based Merced
gives Nice access to the U.S. company’s customer list, which
includes Coca-Cola Co., Bell  Canada  and Dell Inc., Nice Chief
Financial Officer Dafna Gruber said by phone.  “This was a relatively small company selling at $60
million a year with a very impressive list of customers and this
was an opportunity for us,” Gruber said. “This was an
aggregation move.”  Merced’s performance management product will be blended
into Nice’s enterprise offering, which includes tools for fraud
detection. The enterprise business accounted for about 60
percent of Ra’anana, Israel-based Nice’s revenue in 2010, with
most sales coming from the U.S. and  Europe . The acquisition will
add about $55 million to revenue and 10 cents to earnings per
share in 2012 under non-GAAP reporting standards, Nice said.  Nice’s shares have jumped 13 percent in the past 12 months
in Tel Aviv trading compared with a 14 percent drop for the
benchmark TA-25 index.  The company is seeking additional acquisitions and will
have at least $350 million available after the Merced deal
closes around February, Gruber said.  “We’ve done four acquisitions in the customer interaction
business and still have plenty of ideas of what to do,” she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
