Stephen Colbert ponders ‘truthiness”
and shows satirical bits from recent episodes he will probably
riff on before a live audience tonight at the Wellmont Theatre.  We’re hoping to hear more about the “deranged women”
trying to derail the Cain campaign all the way to Uzbekistan.  Buy a premium ticket and join him for a drink, while
supporting the Montclair International Film Festival.  Wellmont Theatre, 5 Seymour St., Montclair, N.J.
Information:  http://www.wellmonttheatre.com/event/72709 .  Saturday  Follow the sun over the course of an afternoon in the
luminous photographs of Uta Barth, at Bonakdar gallery.  The Los Angeles-based artist explores the impact of time on
perception in subtle images.  Runs through Dec. 22 at 521 W. 21st St. Information: +1-
212-414-4144;  http://www.tanyabonakdargallery.com .  Then stop by The Red Cat for a tangerine whiskey sour and
some grilled shrimp tacos. Top it all off with chocolate
raspberry parfait.  At 227 10th Ave. Information: +1-212-242-1122.  Saturday Matinee  George Balanchine ’s “The Nutcracker” is back for its
seasonal outing, a New York City Ballet tradition since the
premiere in 1954.  Sugar Plums, battling toy soldiers, fierce mice and that
telescoping Christmas tree that hits the ceiling and just keeps
on going. This show never gets corny.  Can’t get to Lincoln Center? Check out the Dec. 13 live HD
broadcast in movie theaters.  Runs through Dec. 31 at the David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln
Center. Information: +1-212-870-5656;  http://www.nycballet.com .  Saturday Night  Go hear two of the greatest male singers on the planet in
the  Metropolitan Opera ’s new production of Gounod’s “Faust,”
starring  Jonas Kaufmann  and Rene Pape.  They don’t get all that much to do in this dark, stylized
staging by theater man and opera newbie Des McAnuff. His idea to
update the medieval myth into a lab for atomic bombs is neither
preposterous -- nor probably as exciting as he hoped it might
be.  Excellent actress Marina Poplavskaya is Marguerite, while
Yannick Nezet-Seguin makes Gounod’s endlessly melodic score flow
beautifully.  The live HD broadcast to theaters is Dec. 10; runs through
Jan. 19 at  Lincoln Center . Information: +1-212-362-2000;
 http://www.metopera.org .  Sunday  A fancifully dressed guitarist and a little gray dog stare
as a blond woman is swept up in a passionate embrace.  Watteau’s “La Surprise” (c. 1718) was presumed lost for
two centuries. Then it turned up in an English drawing room in
2007.  It’s now on loan to the Frick, where you can see it
installed in the North Hall together with the artist’s “The
Portal at Valenciennes.”  The Frick Collection is at 1 E. 70th St. Information: +1-
212-288-0700;  http://www.frick.org .  Sunday Matinee  Shen Wei Dance Arts  takes over the 55,000-square-foot drill
hall of the Park Avenue Armory for a new piece, “Undivided,
Divided.”  Combining digital projection and other elements, the work
features dancers moving in wet paint -- partial nudity alert --
to create giant paintings.  Also on the program: Shen Wei’s reimagining of “The Rite
of Spring,” and “Folding,” set to the music of John Tavener
and Tibetan Buddhist chants.  At 643 Park Avenue. Information: +1-212-933-5812;
 http://www.armoryonpark.org .  Sunday Evening  No one does uptight better than David Hyde Pierce, now back
onstage in the world premiere of “Close Up Space” by Molly
Smith Metzler.  He’s an overwrought book editor juggling a diva author,
played by Rosie Perez, a hot-blooded daughter and looming
deadlines.  In previews at the Manhattan Theatre Club’s City Center
Stage 1, 131 W. 55th St., for a Dec. 19 opening. Information:
+1-212-581-1212;  http://www.closeupspacetheplay.com .  Looking Ahead  On Monday night,  Snoop Dogg  and Wiz Khalifa blaze the stage
at Terminal 5.  On tour to support their new joint album, the soundtrack to
their film “Mac and Devin Go To High School,” the duo performs
together, toe to toe.  Snoop, an elder statesman, and hot upstart Wiz are united
in laconic flow and love of trees.  Terminal 5 is at 610 W. 56th St.  Information:  http://www.terminal5nyc.com/event/77441 .  (With assistance from Lili Rosboch. Zinta Lundborg is an
