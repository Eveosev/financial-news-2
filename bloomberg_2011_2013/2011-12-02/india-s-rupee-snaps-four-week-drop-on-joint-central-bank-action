India ’s rupee completed its first
weekly advance since October after joint efforts by central
banks to tackle  Europe ’s debt crisis bolstered sentiment toward
emerging-market assets.  The currency rebounded from last week’s record low as six
monetary authorities led by the U.S. Federal Reserve agreed this
week to lower the  interest rate  on dollar-liquidity swap lines.
The rupee gained for a second day after global investors bought
$27 million  more  Indian shares than they sold on Nov. 30,
according to exchange data.  “Sentiment has improved slightly after the central banks’
actions,” said Vikas Babu, a Mumbai-based currency trader at
state-owned  Andhra Bank . “This is unlikely to last long as only
the symptoms of the crisis are being tackled, and I expect
dollar-buying to resume soon.”  The rupee advanced 2.1 percent this week and 0.5 percent
today to 51.2063 per dollar in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency slumped to a record 52.73 on
Nov. 22.  The premium banks pay to borrow dollars overnight from
central banks will fall by half a percentage point to 50 basis
points, the Fed said. It coordinated the move with the  European
Central Bank  and monetary authorities in Canada, Switzerland,
Japan and the U.K.  Three-month offshore rupee forwards traded at 52.16 to the
dollar, compared with 52.29 yesterday. Forwards are agreements
to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
