Turkish  bonds  gained for a fifth day
after reports the  International Monetary Fund  is considering
contributing to the European rescue package. The lira advanced
against the dollar.  Yields fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
10.28 percent, extending their decline this week to 61 basis
points, the biggest weekly drop since May 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The lira rose 0.1 percent to 1.8262
per dollar at 5:53 p.m., its strongest since Nov. 16.    “It’s a pretty solid rally for us,” Murat Yardimci, head
of trading at ING Bank AS in Istanbul, said in an e-mail. The
currency movement is also supportive of bonds in the short-term
and low liquidity as trading books close is “helping rates to
come down sharply,” Yardimci said.  A European proposal to channel central bank loans through
the IMF may deliver as much as 200 billion euros ($270 billion)
to fight the debt crisis, two people familiar with the
negotiations said.  Turkish bonds are rallying after an increase in yields to
10.9 percent on Nov. 29, up from 8.4 percent in September, the
fastest rise in the price of debt in any emerging market
country. The central bank’s policy of dual  interest rates 
ranging from 5.75 percent to 12.5 percent is “undermining”
sentiment in the  bond market , Citigroup Inc. said in a report
published today.  “The marked decline in trading volume in the bond market
since the central bank’s move at the October monetary policy
committee meeting is one of the early signals of the
distortionary aspects of the bank’s present approach,”
Citigroup said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
