U.S. stock futures extended gains
after unemployment in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped in November
to a two-year low of 8.6 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring this
month advanced 1.3 percent to 1,260.1 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York .  Futures extended gains earlier following a Bloomberg News
report that as much as 200 billion euros ($270 billion) of
national central bank loans may be channeled through the
International Monetary Fund.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 7.4 percent this week and the
market value of global equities increased by more than $3
trillion as the Federal Reserve and five other central banks
lowered the cost of dollar funding and China cut the proportion
that banks need to hold as reserve capital.  The S&P 500 has trimmed its 2011 loss to 1 percent after
rebounding 13 percent from its low for the year on Oct. 3.
Improving U.S. economic data has helped alleviate concern that
the world’s largest economy will relapse into a recession as
 Europe ’s debt crisis threatens to derail the recovery.  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S. has
risen to the highest level since March 18. The gauge, which
measures the rate at which data is beating or missing economist
forecasts, reached 61.9 yesterday and has rebounded from a more-
than two-year low of minus 117.2 in June.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
