A collapse of the euro would wipe 12
percent off the region’s gross domestic product in the following
two years, according to a report by ING Bank NV.  In an attempt to quantify the possible fallout from the end
of economic and monetary union, Mark Cliffe, ING’s London-based
global head of financial markets, calculated the loss in output
would be greater than that following the demise of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.  Financial and trade links mean the economy of the 17
nations now in the euro could drop 9 percent in the first year
of a split, he said. The dollar would surge to the equivalent of
0.85 euros and the price of oil would slide to $55 a barrel,
threatening deflation in the U.S.  Peripheral economies such as  Spain  would suffer from
inflation accelerating toward double digits, while  Germany  and
other core economies would suffer a deflationary shock, said
Cliffe. The exit of  Greece  alone would wipe 10 percent off its
GDP with neighbors losing as much as 5 percent, he said.  The costs suggest to Cliffe that it would be “far
costlier” for Greece to leave the euro area than to sustain the
currency bloc in its current form. Leaders convene in Brussels
next week in an effort to craft another rescue plan for the
region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
