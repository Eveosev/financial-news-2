The Senate today approved a $644.3
billion fiscal 2012 defense budget bill that seeks better cost-
control of the Pentagon’s most expensive weapons program, the
 Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.  The bill also would hold defense contractors responsible
for fake parts in weapons and calls for sanctions on foreign
financial institutions that do business with the Central Bank of
 Iran .  The defense authorization bill, which sets military policy
and spending targets, cuts about $27 billion from the Pentagon’s
request for the fiscal year that started Oct.1. It passed by a
vote of 93-7.  The bill also includes about $18 billion for Department of
Energy program’s under Senate Armed Services Committee
jurisdiction, for a total of $662 billion.  The bill includes a provision that requires the Pentagon to
sign a fixed-price contract with Lockheed Martin for a future
lot of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.  The measure requires the Defense Department to use a fixed-
price contract with an incentive fee for low-rate initial
production of the fifth F-35 lot. The provision requires
Lockheed to absorb 100 percent of costs “above the target cost
specified in the contract.”  -- Editor: Terry Atlas  To contact the reporter on this story:
