Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-
income trader at Cathay United Bank Co., comments on  Taiwan ’s
bond market in a phone interview today.  The yield on the government’s 2 percent notes due July 2016
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.992
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. That was the
biggest fall for benchmark five-year rates since Sept. 5. The
yield on the 1.25 percent securities due September 2021 dropped
three basis points to 1.296 percent.  “Trading volume got significantly bigger today as some
foreign banks entered the swap market, which in turn dragged
down bond yields a lot.  “Since  China  and western central banks are taking steps to
boost their economies, investors are speculating Taiwan may cut
 interest rates  this month as well. That is pretty much the theme
that’s going to dominate the market this month.  “The recent manufacturing data from China was quite
worrying. People are thinking there might really be a recession
coming.”  “Some market players have been doing a bull steepener trade
by longing five-year bonds and shorting 10-year ones.  “Five-year rates could test 0.93 percent by year-end. The
10-year yield is harder to predict, as there’s a re-issuance
coming and that will add to uncertainties in the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
