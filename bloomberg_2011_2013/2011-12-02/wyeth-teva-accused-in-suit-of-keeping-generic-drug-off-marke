Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Wyeth unit and Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. were accused by a group of prescription
drug retailers of illegally keeping a generic version of the
Effexor XR antidepressant off the market.  “Wyeth engaged in an overarching anticompetitive scheme to
prevent and delay the approval and marketing of generic versions
of Effexor XR,” the retailers, including  Walgreen Co. (WAG)  and
 Kroger Co. (KR) , said in a complaint filed Nov. 30 in federal court
in Trenton, New Jersey.  The retailers allege that Wyeth fraudulently obtained
patents and engaged in “sham litigation” to delay generic
versions of the extended release drug. They also alleged that
Wyeth and the U.S. unit of Israel-based Teva Pharmaceuticals
Industries Ltd. colluded to keep  Teva (TEVA) ’s generic version off the
market until June 2010.  Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer, and
Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Teva North America, didn’t
immediately return calls seeking comment on the lawsuit after
regular business hours yesterday.  The case is Walgreen v. Wyeth, 11-6985, U.S. District
Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
