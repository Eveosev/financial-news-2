Lone Star Funds , plagued by legal
disputes in  South Korea  since investing there eight years ago,
is set to reap as much as $4 billion after agreeing to cut the
price on its Korea Exchange Bank stake for a second time.  Lone Star reduced the price to 3.9 trillion won ($3.5
billion), or 11,900 won a share,  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) , the
Seoul-based buyer, said in a regulatory filing yesterday. That’s
11 percent less than the 13,390 won-a-share announced in July
and a  42 percent premium (004940)  over the stock’s closing price.  The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, would be
South Korea’s biggest banking takeover. It paves the way for
 Lone Star  to exit an investment that has embroiled the U.S. fund
in wrangling with courts, regulators and lawmakers amid a
backlash over its profits. The price cut gives Hana control of
Korea Exchange Bank for less than its Sept. 30 book value of
13,148 won a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The new price looks cheap, given that it’s less than
KEB’s valuation,” said Choi Jung Wook, an analyst at Seoul-
based Daishin Securities Co. “There’ll be no more excuses for
the regulator to delay approving the deal.”  Shares of Korea Exchange Bank closed 1.3 percent higher at
8,400 won yesterday in  Seoul  before the announcement. The stock
has lost 31 percent since Lone Star agreed to sell its holding
to Hana more than a year ago. Shares of Hana dropped 3.2 percent
to 40,700 won yesterday.  The takeover will give Hana access to more than 7 million
clients from Korea Exchange Bank’s 382 branches at home and
abroad. The purchase will also boost Hana’s assets to 311
trillion won from 224 trillion won as of the end of September,
helping it narrow the gap with bigger rivals  Woori Finance
Holdings Co. (053000)  and KB Financial Group Inc.  Two Failed Attempts  South Korea’s financial regulator last month said Dallas-
based Lone Star should sell most of its stake after the fund was
convicted of stock-price manipulation by a Seoul court. That
cleared the way for Lone Star, whose two earlier attempts to
sell the stake had been derailed by legal disputes, to proceed
with the sale.  Lone Star, which had invested 2.15 trillion won in Korea
Exchange Bank since 2003, has already recouped 2.53 trillion won
in after-tax profit through dividends and a sale of some shares,
according to data from Korea Exchange Bank.  Hana and the buyout firm agreed in July to extend the
deadline on the pending transaction to Nov. 30 and cut the price
by 6 percent as they awaited the court ruling. The latest
purchase agreement is in effect until Feb. 29, and will be valid
beyond that deadline if neither party terminates it, according
to the filing.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  dropped a $6 billion bid for the holding
in September 2008 after authorities left its proposed
transaction in limbo for more than a year because of legal
disputes.  Standard Chartered Plc’s purchase of Korea First Bank in
2005 for $3.2 billion and Citigroup Inc.’s acquisition of KorAm
Bank for $2.7 billion in 2004 are among the biggest banking
takeovers so far in South Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
