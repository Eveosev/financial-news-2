OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe ’s biggest oil
company, said its Libyan production now is at about 17,000
barrels a day, or 50 percent of prewar levels.  A return to pre-crisis levels may take another 12 to 15
months, Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss told reporters in
Vienna today.  Libya accounted for 33,000 barrels a day, or 10 percent, of
OMV’s total output last year. Producers such as OMV, Eni SpA,
Marathon Oil Corp. and ConocoPhillips shut down operations in
Libya earlier this year as rebel forces took up arms against
supporters of Muammar Qaddafi. The country’s output fell to
60,000 barrels a day in July from 1.7 million barrels a day in
January, according to the  International Energy Agency .  The February closures led OMV to forecast a decline in 2011
production from 2010. The company reported a slump in second-and
third-quarter earnings as the Libyan shutdown cut revenue.  Output in Yemen, which was responsible for about 2 percent
of OMV’s 2010 production, remains at a standstill because of a
damaged export pipeline, Roiss said, adding that it was
unpredictable when production may restart.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
