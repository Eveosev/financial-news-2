Yukon-Nevada Gold Corp. (YNG) , a mining
company with operations in Nevada, fell 8 percent after its
Jerritt Canyon Mill property was put on a safety watch list by
the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration.  “MSHA has initially concluded that a potential pattern of
violations exists at Jerritt Canyon,” Yukon-Nevada said in a
statement today. Yukon-Nevada disagrees with the regulator’s
assessment, Robert Baldock, chief executive officer of the
Vancouver-based company, said in the statement. Jerritt Canyon
is located 50 miles north of Elko, Nevada.  The finding was based mostly on alleged violations that the
company has contested as invalid, the company said. “Most of
the alleged violations have not yet been reviewed and
adjudicated and therefore are not final,” the company said.  Yukon- Nevada  declined to 33 Canadian cents at the close in
Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
