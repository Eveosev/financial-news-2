Barton Biggs , who trimmed bullish
bets in September before U.S. stocks posted the biggest monthly
gain since 1991, said that while he doesn’t want to be fully
invested in equities, “it’s hard to get really bearish.”  “Except for  Europe , the rest of the world economy is doing
pretty well,” the hedge-fund manager said today during an
interview on Bloomberg Radio’s “Surveillance” with Tom Keene
and Ken Prewitt. “There’s too much bearishness, and equities --
particularly U.S. equities and emerging-market equities -- are
very cheap relative to fixed income, Treasury bonds, high yield,
other financial assets.”  His Traxis Global Equity Macro Fund’s net long position, a
gauge of bullish versus bearish investments, is about 60 percent,
Biggs said. During a Nov. 21 interview, Biggs said he cut the
figure to less than 40 percent and might reduce it another 15
percentage points.  The money manager’s optimism on U.S. stocks has shifted
along with the market. He raised the Traxis Global fund’s long
equity position to 65 percent after slashing it to 40 percent in
September, he said in an Oct. 17 interview. Biggs then boosted
the figure to 80 percent, he said two weeks later. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index dropped five straight months through
September before surging 11 percent in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
