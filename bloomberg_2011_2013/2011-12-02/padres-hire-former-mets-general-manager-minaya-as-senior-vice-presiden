Former New York Mets general manager
 Omar Minaya  is returning to  Major League Baseball  with the San
Diego Padres.  Minaya, 53, will serve as senior vice president of baseball
operations, Padres general manager Josh Byrnes said in a
statement released today by the team. Minaya was fired by the
Mets following the 2010 season, after the team’s second
consecutive fourth-place finish in the National League East
division.  “We’re excited to add Omar to our staff,” Byrnes said.
“His experience, knowledge, evaluative skills and connections
throughout the industry will be invaluable for us.”  The Padres were 71-97 last season, finishing 23 games
behind the  Arizona Diamondbacks  in the NL West. San Diego has
not made the playoffs since 2006.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
