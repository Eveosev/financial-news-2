Georgian businesses must seek
listings on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange  to draw additional
“portfolio investments,” Prime Minister Nika Gilauri said.  “The Warsaw Stock Exchange is the place where several
hundreds of millions can be made,” Gilauri said in an interview
today. “I know several Georgian businesses are wishing to be
there.”  Foreign investment in Georgian companies was $256 million
in the third quarter and is expected to reach $1 billion for the
year, he said.  Poland’s Deputy Treasury Minister Krzysztof Walenczak said
in an interview in Tbilisi today that he was heading a small
delegation to  Georgia  to promote the Warsaw Stock Exchange and
attract Georgian businesses seeking funding and expansion
opportunities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
