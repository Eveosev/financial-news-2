Citigroup Inc.’s (C)  Southeast Asia head
of mergers and acquisitions advisory, Giles Ong, has left after
seven years with the bank, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  Ong, 42, joined Citigroup in 2004 from Merrill Lynch & Co.
and assumed his most recent position two years later. His last
day at the bank was yesterday, one person said. Four vice
presidents in Citigroup’s Asian investment banking team also
left this week, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the information is private.  The departures follow an expansion that saw Citigroup hire
more than 40 directors for its Asian investment banking business
this year. More than 200,000 jobs in the global financial-
services industry have been eliminated in 2011, eclipsing the
174,000 positions lost in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  James Griffiths , a spokesman at the New York-based firm in
 Hong Kong , declined to comment on the departures. “We continue
to hire in critical positions to support our clients,” he said.  Citigroup ranks first among advisers on mergers in
Southeast Asia this year and sixth in the Asia-Pacific region
outside  Japan , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank
is No. 7 in equity underwriting in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan,
the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
