Thailand ’s baht had its biggest
weekly advance since July after regional central banks took
measures to boost economic growth.  The currency touched a two-week high after international
investors bought $72 million more local equities than they sold
this week through yesterday, according to exchange data. The
Bank of Thailand cut its one-day bond repurchase  rate  for the
first time in more than two years on Nov. 30, hours before the
People’s Bank of  China  slashed lenders’ reserve-requirement
ratios for the first time since 2008.  “Market players have welcomed moves by the central banks,
which is improving sentiment,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “With this sentiment,
we are seeing some fund inflows into the region, supporting the
currencies.”  The baht climbed 1.9 percent this week and 0.2 percent
today to 30.84 per dollar as of 3:14 p.m. in Bangkok, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency may trade in a range
of 30.60 and 31 next week, Hasegawa said.  The Bank of Thailand cut its benchmark  interest rate  by a
quarter percentage point to 3.25 percent on Nov. 30 and said it
may ease policy further if the nation struggles to recover from
its worst floods in 70 years that disrupted factory production.  The baht’s strength may be short-lived because of
uncertainties in the global economy, Bank of Thailand Director
Singhachai Boonyayotin said today.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 slumped 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 3.13
percent this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rate declined one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
