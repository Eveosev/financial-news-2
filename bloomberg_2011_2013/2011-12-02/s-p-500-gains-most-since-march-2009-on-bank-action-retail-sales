U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its biggest weekly rally since
March 2009, after central banks took action to ease Europe’s
debt crisis and American Thanksgiving retail sales set a record.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  was little changed in the week’s final trading
session after erasing a 1.3 percent gain following an
unexpected drop in the U.S. jobless rate.  Boeing Co. (BA) ,  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  jumped more than 11 percent to
lead the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) ’s weekly advance. Energy
producers and financial companies led a surge by all 10
industries in the S&P 500 and added at least 9.4 percent.
 Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  jumped 7.5 percent after record Black Friday
sales of its Kindle products.  The S&P 500 climbed 7.4 percent to 1,244.28 since Nov. 25,
snapping a two-week decline to trim its 2011 loss to 1.1
percent. The Dow added 787.64 points, or 7 percent, to 12,019.42
this week and is up 3.8 percent for the year.  “This week’s move was sparked by the global coordinated
efforts by central banks and the greater clarity provided by
European policy makers on plans to stabilize the debt
situation,” Chad Morganlander, a Florham Park, New Jersey-based
money manager at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which oversees more than
$116 billion in client assets, said in a telephone interview.
“U.S. retail sales reports provided greater confirmation of
stability within the  U.S. economy .”  The  S&P 500  surged after the  Federal Reserve  and five other
central banks lowered the cost of dollar funding and  China  cut
the proportion that banks need to hold as reserve capital.
Germany and France are leading a push for tougher enforcement of
euro-area budget rules to counter the debt crisis now in its
third year.  13% Rebound  The stock index has rebounded more than 13 percent from its
2011 low on Oct. 3. Improving U.S. economic data has helped
alleviate concern that the world’s largest economy will relapse
into a recession as Europe’s debt crisis threatens to derail the
recovery.  The S&P 500 jumped 2.9 percent on Nov. 28 after U.S. retail
sales during the Thanksgiving weekend increased 16 percent to
$52.4 billion, the  National Retail Federation  said, citing a
survey conducted by BIGresearch. The average shopper spent
$398.62, up from $365.34 a year earlier. A Nov. 29 report showed
that consumer confidence snapped back more than forecast in
November as Americans turned less pessimistic on the outlook for
jobs.  Improving Data  Jobs data released by the Labor Department Dec. 2 showed
that payrolls climbed 120,000, with more than half the hiring
coming from retailers and temporary help agencies, after a
revised 100,000 rise in October that was more than initially
estimated. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called
for a gain of 125,000. The jobless rate declined to 8.6 percent,
the lowest since March 2009, from 9 percent.  The  Citigroup Economic Surprise Index  for the U.S. has
risen to the highest level since March 9. The gauge, which
measures the rate at which data is beating or missing economist
forecasts in Bloomberg surveys, reached 85.7 and has rebounded
from a more-than two-year low of minus 117.2 in June.  Barton Biggs , who trimmed bullish bets in September before
U.S. stocks posted the biggest monthly gain since 1991, said
that while he doesn’t want to be fully invested in equities,
“it’s hard to get really bearish.”  ‘Too Much Bearishness’  “Except for  Europe , the rest of the world economy is doing
pretty well,” the hedge-fund manager said Dec. 2 during an
interview on Bloomberg Radio’s “Surveillance” with Tom Keene
and Ken Prewitt. “There’s too much bearishness, and equities --
particularly U.S. equities and emerging-market equities -- are
very cheap relative to fixed income, Treasury bonds, high yield,
other financial assets.”  All 10 groups in the S&P 500 rose this week, led by a 10
percent rally in energy producers as crude oil had its first
gain in three weeks. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index surged
9.6 percent amid easing concern about global economic growth.  Boeing, the world’s largest aerospace and defense company,
added 14 percent to $71.30. Caterpillar, the world’s largest
construction and mining-equipment maker, rose 11 percent to
$96.29.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  jumped the most in the S&P
500, adding 28 percent to $24.11, while  U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  rallied
25 percent, the third-most in the index, to $27.81.  Financial shares rose 9.5 percent, the second-most among 10
industries in the S&P 500. JPMorgan jumped 14 percent to $32.33.
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  surged 9.6 percent to $97.25. A gauge
of European banking shares climbed 14 percent, the second-best
performance among 19 groups in the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  VIX Retreats  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, tumbled 20 percent to 27.52, the lowest level in
a month.  Amazon.com rose 7.5 percent to $196.03. The world’s largest
Internet retailer said it sold four times more Kindle products
on Black Friday compared with last year.  Western Digital Corp. (WDC)  climbed 26 percent, the second-most
in the S&P 500, to $31.44. The U.S. maker of disk drives and
networking products raised its quarterly revenue forecast to at
least $1.8 billion from at most $1.25 billion after rebounding
from a flood in Thailand that devastated factories and
constrained supplies.  Hospira Inc. (HSP)  fell the most in the S&P 500, slipping 8.1
percent to $27.64. The maker of generic injectable drugs may
face “widespread” production breakdowns that could take two to
three years to correct, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC
said. Hospira’s depressed valuation may attract takeover
interest from competitors, said Capstone Investments.  To contact the reporters on this story:
