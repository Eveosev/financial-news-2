Saba Capital Management LP, the hedge
fund run by Boaz Weinstein, has bought Italian  government bonds 
and is hedging with debt from the region’s banks.  “As much as  Italy  has challenges, the market has in our
view suffered way too much, taken yield to basically junk levels
for Italian sovereign debt,” Weinstein said today at the
Bloomberg Link Hedge Funds Summit in New York. “We’re buying
Italian sovereign bonds, and where we’re finding hedges is,
surprisingly even as late as month or two ago, you could find
Italian banks that are not particularly large or structurally
important banks, whose yields were trading at lower levels than
Italian sovereign even though the riskiness is much greater.”  Saba said in January it had bought Greek government bonds
in a bet the country could resolve its fiscal crisis, purchasing
“deeply discounted” securities while selling derivatives that
protect against a low recovery should the securities default.  Europe ’s banks will have to divest $1 trillion in assets
and the region’s high-yield default rate will jump to as high as
12 percent in the second half of 2012, according toBruce Richards, co-founder and chief executive officer of Marathon
Asset Management LP.  While a coordinated move yesterday by central banks to
lower dollar funding costs helps, Europe’s debt crisis will
worsen and likely lead to a fiscal union before improving,
according to Mark Okada, chief investment officer of Highland
Capital Management LP.  “It’s got to get a lot worse before it gets better,” he
said at the conference. “You’ve got to have some sort of flash
point moment where we have a real crisis before you get
eventually, someday down the road, the United States of
Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
