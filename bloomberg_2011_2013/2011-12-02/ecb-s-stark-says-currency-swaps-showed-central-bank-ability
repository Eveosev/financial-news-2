European Central Bank Executive Board
member Juergen Stark said this week’s decision to make it
cheaper for banks to borrow in dollars showed central banks’
ability to provide liquidity in a crisis.  “Central banks have again demonstrated in a critical
moment” their ability to manage a crisis, Stark said in
response to audience questions at an event in  New York . There
was an “issue” with dollar funding of both “shortage” and
“price,” he said.  Stark said there is “no lack of liquidity in euros,”
though there might have been a “misperception” by other
countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
