Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.07 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.06 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.12 percent and averaging 0.08 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will carry out two separate operations
today. It will buy $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion worth of
Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to November 2041 at its
customary 10:15 a.m. New York time. In the afternoon, the Fed
will sell $8 billion to $8.75 billion in Treasuries maturing
from April 2013 to October 2013.  The transactions are part of the Fed’s program to replace
$400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-
term Treasuries to reduce borrowing costs further and counter
rising risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
