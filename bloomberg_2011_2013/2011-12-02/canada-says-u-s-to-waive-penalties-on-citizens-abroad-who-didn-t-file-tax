The U.S. has agreed to waive
penalties it planned to enforce against some Americans living in
 Canada  who failed to file  tax returns  in both countries, the
parliamentary secretary to Canada’s revenue minister said.  “The U.S. has agreed to show leniency, including waiving
penalties for many and allowing potential refunds of penalties
already paid,” Cathy McLeod said in the House of Commons in
Ottawa today.  The  Internal Revenue Service  will soon publish a
clarification of existing requirements for filing tax returns
and declarations of investments held abroad, said Susan Crystal,
a spokeswoman at the U.S. embassy in Ottawa. U.S. Ambassador to
Canada David Jacobson said in an Oct. 18 speech he was
sympathetic because many of the estimated 1 million dual Canada-
U.S. citizens hadn’t met the requirements for years.  There should be no penalty for late filings where no taxes
are owed, and Americans can earn tax credits for levies paid in
Canada, Crystal said. On foreign investments, citizens can also
make a late disclosure and may avoid any penalties depending on
the explanation given, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
