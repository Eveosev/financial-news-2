Cocoa fell to a 32-month low on signs
of rising supplies in  Ivory Coast  and  Ghana , the world’s biggest
producers. Sugar and coffee also dropped.  For the season that started Oct. 1, cocoa deliveries to
ports in Ivory Coast, the top grower, rose 6 percent through
Nov. 27, a document from the industry’s regulator showed.
Purchases from farmers in Ghana climbed 21 percent in the first
five weeks of the harvest, according to Kwabena Asante Poku, the
deputy chief executive officer of the Ghana Cocoa Board.  “The market is well supplied,” Sterling Smith, an analyst
with Country Hedging in  St. Paul ,  Minnesota , said in a telephone
interview. Cocoa is trading at a “discount in the cash
market,” signaling ample production, he said.  Cocoa for March delivery dropped 2.6 percent to settle at
$2,228 a metric ton at 12:12 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , after touching $2,218, the lowest for a most-active
contract since March 2009. Prices have slumped for seven
straight sessions.  The chocolate ingredient retreated 6.4 percent this week,
the most since September, and has plunged 27 percent this year.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery slipped 0.6 percent to
23.45 cents a pound in New York. For the week, the sweetener
rose 2.4 percent, paring this year’s decline to 27 percent.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery fell 2.6 percent
to $2.2955 a pound. The price, which slid 1.3 percent this week,
is down 4.6 percent in 2011.  Prices also fell today as the dollar gained as much as 0.6
percent against a basket of six major currencies, reducing the
appeal of raw materials as alternative assets, said Hernando de la Roche, the director of futures with INTL FCStone in Miami.  In London futures trading, cocoa, refined sugar and robusta
coffee declined on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
