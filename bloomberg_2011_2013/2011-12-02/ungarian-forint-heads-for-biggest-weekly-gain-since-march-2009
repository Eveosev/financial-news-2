The forint strengthened, extending
its biggest weekly advance in almost 2 1/2 years, as the
government prepares to begin aid talks with the  International
Monetary Fund .  Hungary’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 304.3 per
euro, bringing its jump this week to 3.4 percent, the most on a
closing basis since July 2009. The benchmark BUX  index (BUX)  of stocks
rallied 1.7 percent to 17,447.64 by the close in Budapest,
bringing the five-day advance to 6 percent.  Hungary raised its benchmark  interest rate  on Nov. 29 to
stem the forint’s depreciation, which central bank President
Andras Simor yesterday said bought time for the government to
reach an agreement with the IMF on a safety net. Development
Minister Tamas Fellegi will lead talks with the IMF and not
Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy , who had earlier opposed
seeking international assistance.  “It may count as a positive turn in Hungarian economic
policy that Tamas Fellegi and not Gyorgy Matolcsy will represent
the country at the IMF negotiations,” Peter Deaki and Zsigmond
Gelencser, analysts at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., a Budapest-
based brokerage, wrote in a research report today. “That could
please investors.”  A European proposal to channel central bank loans through
the IMF may deliver as much as 200 billion euros ($270 billion)
to fight the debt crisis, two people familiar with the
negotiations said.  Hungary’s benchmark 10-year government bonds rallied, with
the yield down four basis points to 8.75 percent.  Payroll gains in the U.S. picked up last month and the
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to the lowest level since
March 2009, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
