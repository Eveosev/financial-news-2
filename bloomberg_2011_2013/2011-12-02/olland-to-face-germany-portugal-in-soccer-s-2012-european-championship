Defending champion Spain will face
Italy, Ireland and  Croatia  in its group matches of soccer’s
European Championship next year, while the Netherlands will play
Portugal,  Germany  and Denmark in its opening games.  The 16 teams will play in Poland and Ukraine in the event,
which runs June 8 to July 1. European soccer’s governing body,
UEFA, made Spain and the Netherlands the top seeds in the event.
The Spanish defeated Holland 1-0 in last year’s World Cup final.  The tournament is the most-watched sporting event after the
World Cup and Summer Olympics. It’s the first time the event has
been held in Eastern Europe and the last featuring 16 teams.
France will play host to an expanded 24-team version in 2016.  Spain  is the 9-4 favorites with English bookmaker William
Hill Plc, meaning a successful $4 bet brings in $9 plus the
original stake. Germany is 7-2, while  England  and Holland are a
joint third at 7-1.  Highlights of the opening pool games include a match
between the Netherlands, champion in 1988, and record three-time
winner Germany, as well as England’s meeting with France.  When planning in 2009, Poland forecast spending about 20
billion euros ($27 billion) on building and upgrading roads,
stadiums, hotels and airports. Ukrainian officials said in
December 2008 that the country planned to spend 6 billion
hryvnias ($750 million) on the tournament.  The countries beat out Italy and a joint bid from Hungary
and Croatia to win rights to host next year’s event.  Matchups  Portugal  defeated the Netherlands in the semifinals of the
2004 European Championship as well as in the last 16 match of
the 2006 World Cup.  England beat Sweden 1-0 in an exhibition match at Wembley
in  London  last month, the first time in 43 years it had beaten
the visitors in 12 matches since 1968. England will also play
Ukraine in qualifying for the 2014 World Cup. France hasn’t lost
to England the last five times they’ve met.  Spain beat Ireland in a penalty shoot out in their last
competitive match, in the last 16 at the 2002 World Cup.  *T GROUPS FOR EURO 2012  GROUP A
