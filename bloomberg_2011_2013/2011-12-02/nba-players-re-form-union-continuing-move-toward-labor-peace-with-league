National Basketball Association
players voted to re-form their union, allowing the group to
begin final negotiations with the league on a new labor deal.  More than 300 of the approximately 450 NBA players sent in
cards re-authorizing the National Basketball Players Association
to handle collective bargaining, union spokesman  Dan Wasserman 
said yesterday.  The NBA and its players agreed in principle on a new deal
on Nov. 26, setting up a process by which a five-month-old
lockout would end. Ratifying an agreement will allow training
camps and free agency to begin on Dec. 9 and an abbreviated 66-
game season to start on Dec. 25.  Among the first steps was for the NBPA, which dissolved on
Nov. 14 prior to the filing of antitrust lawsuits against the
league, to re-form so that it could serve as the collective
bargaining representative with the NBA. Re-forming required a
majority vote of the NBPA’s players.  The two sides can now begin addressing settlement terms as
well as secondary issues such as drug testing, the NBA
commissioner’s disciplinary powers and workplace rules.  Team facilities are open for player workouts as of today.
Conditioning and weight training may only be supervised by
athletic trainers and strength coaches, and no staff members may
oversee on-court activity until the deal is completed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
