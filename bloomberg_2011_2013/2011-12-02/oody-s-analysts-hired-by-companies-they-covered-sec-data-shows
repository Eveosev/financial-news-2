Analysts from the three largest debt-
grading firms took jobs at companies they ranked, according to
data released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Companies hired 82 credit-rating analysts from Moody’s
Investors Service and 23 from Standard & Poor’s since 2010,
according to a  list  on the SEC website. Twenty-four analysts
were hired from  Fitch Ratings  in the past five years, the list
shows. The agency was ordered to collect the information by the
Dodd-Frank Act.  “We have had a longstanding policy that predates the Dodd-
Frank Act to review the work of analysts when they leave to work
for an issuer or arranger,”  Ed Sweeney , a spokesman for McGraw-
Hill Cos.’s New York-based S&P unit, said in an e-mail.  Michael Adler, a spokesman for New York-based Moody’s, and
Daniel Noonan of Fitch declined to comment. The Wall Street
Journal reported on the data earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
