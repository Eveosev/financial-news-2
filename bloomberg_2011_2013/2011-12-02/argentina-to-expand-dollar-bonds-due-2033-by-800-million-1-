Argentina  plans to expand its dollar-
denominated local law bonds due in 2033 by $800 million,
according to a statement published in the  official gazette 
today.  The bonds, which were first issued in 2005 under local
legislation as part of the restructuring of the country’s
defaulted debt, have a coupon of 8.28 percent. The statement
didn’t say when the sale will take place.  Argentina hasn’t tapped international credit markets since
its record $95 billion default in late 2001. President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  held a second swap last year, resulting in
a total of 93 percent of private bondholders accepting the
offer. Holders of about $4.5 billion who didn’t accept the
country’s offers are pursuing litigation.  Blocked from international markets, the government used
$6.6 billion in central bank reserves last year to pay debt and
$7.5 billion this year. It plans to use $5.7 billion in 2012 for
the same purpose, according to the budget bill. Central bank
reserves fell to $46.1 billion yesterday from a record $52.6
billion in January.  “This doesn’t mean that this is a return to monetary
markets, but it’s a good move,” said  Boris Segura , a senior
Latin America strategist at Nomura Securities International in
New York. “Authorities are recognizing that they can’t continue
to drain its international reserves to service debt.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
