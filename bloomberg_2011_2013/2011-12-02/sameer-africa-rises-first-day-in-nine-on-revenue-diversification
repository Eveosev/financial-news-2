Sameer Africa Ltd. (SAME) , a Kenyan tire
maker, rose for the first day in nine after the company said it
is diversifying its revenue base.  The stock rose 1.3 percent, to 3.9 shillings at the 3:00
p.m. close in Nairobi, the biggest day gain since Nov. 21. The
company’s shares have fallen 49 percent this year, making it the
eighth worst-performing stock on the Nairobi Securities
Exchange.  “The revenue diversification story is something good,”
Rufus Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based Canaan Capital
Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Sameer completed construction of new office blocks on 8.8
acres in the capital, Nairobi, the company said on its  website .
The complex is being inaugurated today by President Mwai Kibaki,
the presidency said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
