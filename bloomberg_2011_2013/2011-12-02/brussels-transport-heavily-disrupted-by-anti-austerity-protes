Public transport in Brussels will be
“heavily disrupted” today as trade unions in Belgium stage a
protest demonstration in the capital, the city’s metro, tram and
bus operator, STIB, said in a statement on its website.  Services will operate “in function of the available
drivers,” STIB said. “The metro, tram and bus lines as well as
our sales network will be heavily disrupted, due to the
participation of part of our staff in this demonstration.”  As many as 50,000 trade-union members are expected to
gather in the city centre to protest against austerity measures
being introduced in response to the euro-area’s fiscal crisis,
Belga news agency reported, citing union announcements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
