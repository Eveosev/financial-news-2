Gasoline rose to a two-week high on
speculation that supplies will decline after  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  halted
production yesterday at one of its two Pennsylvania refineries.  Futures gained 2.3 percent, capping the largest weekly gain
since July 1, after Sunoco said it’s idling the 194,000-barrel-
a-day Marcus Hook refinery. The company is trying to sell that
facility and the 335,000-barrel-a-day Philadelphia plant.  “The shutdown of the Sunoco refinery has really boosted
gasoline values since the industry is going to have to make up
the shortfall in other locations,” said  Andy Lipow , president
of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for January delivery gained 5.83 cents to settle
at $2.6162 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
highest settlement since Nov. 16. Prices rose 6.8 percent this
week, the first increase in seven weeks, and are up 6.6 percent
this year.  The contract reflects reformulated gasoline blendstock, or
RBOB, delivered in  New York  Harbor. Reduced supplies along the
East Coast typically boost futures prices.  “Sunoco closing their main processing units at Marcus Hook
reinforces the fact that some of the East Coast refining
capacity seems to be going offline,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Refinery Closures  ConocoPhillips (COP)  shut the 190,000-barrel-a-day Trainer,
Pennsylvania, refinery Sept. 30 while it seeks a buyer. Sunoco
has said it will shut the Philadelphia plant by July if it’s not
sold. The closing of the three refineries would trim East Coast
 operating capacity  by 739,000 barrels a day, or 46 percent, by
the middle of 2012.  U.S. refiners used 84.6 percent of capacity in the week
ended Nov. 25, while those on the East Coast operated at 66.6
percent, according to Energy Department data.  Gasoline
production  fell 3 percent to 9.19 million barrels a day.  “Trainer and  Marcus Hook  are two big gasoline producers
and that’s going to be a big hit for Padd 1,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Wakefield, Massachusetts. “That’s about 180,000 barrels a day
of gasoline disappeared if you assumed they were running at full
capacity.”  U.S.  gasoline inventories  rose 213,000 barrels last week to
an eight-week high of 209.8 million, according to department
data. Stockpiles in Padd 1 were 54.6 million barrels, the most
since the week ended Sept. 30.  Less Demand  Demand, or  deliveries  to wholesalers, was 2.9 percent below
a year earlier, measured on a four-week average.  Gasoline’s gains today “are supply-related,” said Ray
Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York and a
broker at the  New York Mercantile Exchange . “I don’t think it’s
demand-related.”  The Labor Department reported that the November  jobless
rate  fell 0.4 percentage point to 8.6 percent, the lowest since
March 2009. Payrolls climbed 120,000, with more than half the
hiring coming from retailers and temporary help agencies. The
lower jobless rate reflected a 278,000 gain in employment at the
same time 315,000 Americans left the  labor force .  “Maybe the drop in the  unemployment rate  is helping the
market, but we didn’t get near enough new jobs created,”
McGillian said.  January-delivery heating oil rose 2.05 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $2.99 a gallon on the exchange. Prices
gained 2.1 percent this week, the first increase in three weeks,
and are up 18 percent for the year.  Heating oil’s premium to gasoline narrowed 3.78 cents to
37.38 cents a gallon, the smallest since Nov. 2. The spread
reached 62.69 cents on Nov. 14.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.6
cent to $3.286 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
