Tocqueville Finance SA, a Paris-based
portfolio management company, and one of its executives were
fined by  France ’s financial markets regulator for manipulating
share prices.  Tocqueville and Marc Tournier, a  fund manager , bought
shares in June 2009 to drive up the price, the Autorite des
Marches Financiers said today in an e-mailed statement, without
identifying the shares.  Tocqueville was fined 150,000 euros ($201,000) and Tournier
250,000 euros. Both disputed the accusations at an October
hearing.  Tocqueville Finance “will take the time to reflect on the
decision and think about a potential appeal,” a spokeswoman,
who declined to be identified, said today. The company “always
acted in the best interests of its clients.”  Calls to Tournier were referred to the Tocqueville
spokeswoman.  The AMF inflicted a heavier fine than was recommended at
the hearing, calling the violation “particularly serious" given
that Tournier and Tocqueville Finance had previously been
sanctioned by the regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
