JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  sold $375
million of bonds tied to the Palisades Center shopping mall in
New York, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  A $242.9 million portion of top-ranked debt with a
projected life of 4.9 years yields 195 basis points more than
benchmark swap rates, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the deal was private. The issuer initially
proposed paying a spread of about 215 basis points, or 2.15
percentage points.  Developer Pyramid Management Group LLC owns the property
and J.C. Penney Co., Home Depot Inc. and  Target Corp. (TGT)  are the
largest tenants of the 1.9-million square-foot shopping center
in West Nyack, New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Wall Street banks have arranged about $26 billion of
commercial-mortgage backed securities this year. While thatâ€™s up
from $11.5 billion in 2010, issuance totaled more than $200
billion in 2007 when commercial-real estate prices peaked, the
data show.  The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries fell yesterday
to 2.77 percentage points from 2.88 percentage points in the
prior week, according to the Barclays Capital CMBS AAA Super
Duper Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
