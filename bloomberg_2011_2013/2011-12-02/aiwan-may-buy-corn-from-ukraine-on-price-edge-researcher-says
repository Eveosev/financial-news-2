Taiwan is likely to buy corn exported
from Ukraine because itâ€™s cheaper than U.S.-grown grain,
UkrAgroConsult said.  Ukrainian corn is being offered at prices between $13 and
$25 a metric ton lower than U.S.-origin grain, the Kiev-based
agricultural researcher said by e-mail today. Taiwan imported
500 tons of Ukrainian corn in the season that ran through June,
UkrAgroConsult said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
