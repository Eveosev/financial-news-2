United Co. Rusal (486) , holder of 25
percent of OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, asked the nickel producer’s
board to call a shareholder meeting to approve compensation for
independent directors.  Rusal proposes the base payment for each independent
director be $62,500 a quarter, plus $31,250 in each quarter that
the director is the head a board committee, Maxim Sokov, the
aluminum company’s deputy chief executive officer, said in a
letter to Norilsk’s board, a copy of which was obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Norilsk received Sokov’s letter, said Alisa Fialko, a
spokeswoman for the Moscow-based mining company, the world’s
largest producer of nickel.  Rusal, controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska, will need
support to pass the measure from other shareholders, including
billionaire  Vladimir Potanin ’s Interros Holding Co., with which
the aluminum producer is battling for control of the nickel
producer. Norilsk failed to gain sufficient shareholder approval
for a compensation plan at the annual meeting in June.  Rusal also wants approval for an option plan for
independent directors, linking payments to Norilsk’s share
price. The directors may also claim as much as 2 million rubles
($65,000) in expenses a year under the proposal.  “Management agrees that independent directors’ work should
be paid and is now working on setting standards for whom should
be considered an independent director,” Fialko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
