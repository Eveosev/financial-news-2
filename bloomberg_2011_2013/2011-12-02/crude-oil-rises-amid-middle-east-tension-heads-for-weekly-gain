Oil rose, heading for its first
weekly gain in three, as concern deepened that tension between
 Iran  and the west will disrupt Middle East exports.  Futures jumped as much as 1.4 percent after the Labor
Department said U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly declined to
8.6 percent from 9 percent, before paring their advance.
European governments tightened sanctions on Iran, the second-
biggest crude producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, in a clampdown over the Persian Gulf
nation’s nuclear program. Bank of America Corp. today cut its
2012 Brent forecast.  “The oil market is strongly supported by the geopolitical
risks over Iran, and a physical market that’s already very
tight,” said James Zhang, a strategist at Standard Bank Plc in
 London  who forecasts prices will remain at current levels for
the rest of the year. “Oil will be range-bound without a crisis
in Iran or blow-up in the  euro zone .”  Crude for January delivery climbed as much as $1.36 to
$101.56 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and was $100.62 at 1:47 p.m. London time.
The contract gained 4 percent this week.  Brent oil for January settlement was at $109.39 a barrel,
up 40 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.
The contract slid $1.53, or 1.4 percent, to $108.99 yesterday.  The European contract’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
crude traded in  New York  widened 24 cents to $9.03 a barrel. The
spread surged to a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Jobless Rate  The  jobless rate  dropped to the lowest since March 2009,
according to the Labor Department. Payrolls climbed 120,000,
with more than half the hiring coming from retailers and
temporary help agencies, after a revised 100,000 rise in October
that was more than initially estimated. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey called for a gain of 125,000.  Futures may fall next week, a separate Bloomberg News
survey showed. Eleven of 24 analysts, or 46 percent, forecast
oil will fall through Dec. 9. Nine, or 38 percent, predicted a
gain, and four said there will be little change. Last week, 57
percent projected a drop.  “The world economy faces a binary outcome -- bad or
ugly,”  Francisco Blanch , Bank of America’s New York-based head
of  commodities research, wrote in a report today. “A mild
recession in Europe is probably inevitable. On the other side,
the supply picture is steadily improving.”  Bank of America today trimmed its Brent oil-price forecast
for next year to $108 a barrel from $114. It raised its 2013
estimate to $118 a barrel.  West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark contract, will
average $101 next year and $111 in 2013, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
