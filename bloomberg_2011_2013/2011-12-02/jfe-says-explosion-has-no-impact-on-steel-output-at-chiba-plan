JFE Holdings Inc. ,  Japan ’s second-
largest steelmaker, said its steel mill in Chiba, near  Tokyo , is
operating normally after four workers were injured by an
explosion at JFE Chemical Co.’s sulfuric acid tank.  The explosion, which occurred within the site of JFE’s
steel works at 9:55 a.m., Japan time, didn’t cause a fire and
hasn’t impacted steel production, spokesman Seiji Iwashita said
today by telephone.  JFE is investigating the cause of the accident, he said.
JFE Chemical is a wholly owned unit of JFE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
