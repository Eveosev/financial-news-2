U.S. stocks were little changed,
erasing an earlier rally, as losses in health-care and utility
shares offset an unexpected drop in the  unemployment rate .  The S&P 500 dropped 0.1 percent to 1,243.76 at 3:50 p.m.
New York time, after rising as much as 1.3 percent. The index
has gained 7.8 this week, heading for its biggest weekly rally
since March 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
