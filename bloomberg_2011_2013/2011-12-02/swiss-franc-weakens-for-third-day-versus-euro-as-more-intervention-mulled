The  franc  fell against all its major
counterparts after  Switzerland  said yesterday it may consider
additional steps to support the central bank in its fight
against the currency’s appreciation.  The franc dropped for a third day versus the euro after the
government said it was willing to “examine the feasibility of
supporting measures.” The steps, which may include negative
interest rates, would help prop up the Swiss National Bank’s
defense of a 1.20-franc ceiling versus the euro imposed on Sept.
6. The Swiss currency also fell against the euro after French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  signaled more would be done to counter
the region’s debt crisis.  “We believe that the speculation is going to continue to
drive the euro higher against the Swiss franc,” said Peter Rosenstreich, chief currency analyst at Swissquote Bank SA in
Geneva. “Negative  interest rates  are an interesting idea but
it’s most likely that the SNB are going to use foreign-exchange
intervention.”  The franc dropped 0.1 percent to 1.2340 per euro at 4:56
p.m. in London, extending this week’s decline to 0.2 percent.
The currency dropped 0.7 percent to 92.22 centimes per dollar.  Rosenstreich said the franc may weaken to 1.25 per euro.  The Swiss currency has depreciated 10 percent in the past
three months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes, the worst performer of 10 developed-nation currencies.  The SNB has said it would sell “unlimited quantities” of
the currency to maintain the franc’s cap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
