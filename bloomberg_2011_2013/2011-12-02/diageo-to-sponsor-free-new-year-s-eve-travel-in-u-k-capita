Diageo Plc (DGE) , the maker of Smirnoff
vodka and Johnnie Walker whisky, will sponsor free travel in
 London  over the New Year as part of a three-year agreement to
promote responsible drinking during the holiday season.  Diageo’s partnership with  Transport for London , the U.K.
capital’s transport authority, will allow customers to travel
for free from 11:45 p.m. on Dec. 31 through 4:30 a.m. on Jan. 1,
the London-based distiller said today in an e-mailed statement.  Transport for London has provided free travel on New Year’s
Eve for about a decade, and Diageo will sponsor the initiative
for three years, it said today.  The maker of Guinness stout will promote  responsible
drinking  during the holiday through advertising on tube trains,
buses, and in subway stations, and will distribute free bottles
of water at some stations. It introduced the festive campaign
today alongside racing driver  Lewis Hamilton .  “Responsible drinking is at the heart of everything we do
and is never more important during the festive season,” Andrew
Cowan, director of Diageo Great Britain, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
