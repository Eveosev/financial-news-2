German stocks (DAX)  climbed, with the
benchmark DAX Index posting its biggest weekly advance in three
years, after a report showed unemployment in the U.S.
unexpectedly dropped in November.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , the country’s largest
lenders, led gains, rising more than 5 percent.  Daimler AG 
climbed 3.1 percent, while  Salzgitter AG (SZG) , Germany’s second-
largest steelmaker, rose 1.4 percent.  The DAX Index added 0.7 percent to 6,080.68 in  Frankfurt ,
for an 11 percent weekly jump, its biggest rally since November
2008. The gauge rose this week as the  European Central Bank  and
five other central banks lowered the cost of dollar funding,
 China  cut its  reserve-requirement ratio  for banks and U.S.
consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in November. The broader
HDAX Index climbed 0.8 percent today.  “It’s very good news and it’s encouraging,” Yves Marcais,
a sales trader at Global Equities in Paris, said on the U.S.
jobs report. “We have the feeling the  U.S. economy  is more
solid than expected.”  The jobless rate declined to 8.6 percent, the lowest since
March 2009, from 9 percent, a Labor Department release showed
today. Payrolls climbed 120,000, with more than half of the
hiring coming from retailers and temporary-help agencies, after
a revised 100,000 gain in October. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey called for an increase of 125,000.  Closer Fiscal Union  In  Europe ,  Germany  and  France  are pushing for closer
economic ties among euro-area nations and tougher enforcement of
budget rules to counter the debt crisis.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  repeated her wish to rework
European Union rules to lock in budget monitoring and seal off
the European Central Bank from political interference. French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  late yesterday called for “more
discipline” and automatic penalties for nations that break
fiscal rules.  Merkel told the lower house of parliament today that
overcoming the euro region’s sovereign-debt crisis “is a
process and this process will take years.”  “The government has always made it clear that the debt
crisis can’t be solved at a single stroke and there are no easy
and fast solutions,” Merkel said. She also said issuance of
common euro bonds is “unthinkable” while governments retain
national control over budgets.  Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank  Financial shares  paced gains, with Deutsche Bank rising 5.1
percent to 30.08 euros and  Allianz SE (ALV) ,  Europe’s biggest insurer ,
gaining 3.2 percent to 78.72 euros.  Munich Re , the world’s
largest reinsurer, added 1.9 percent to 94.82 euros.  Commerzbank  jumped 11 percent to 1.50 euros. The bank will
introduce a plan to shore up its capital without state aid, Die
Welt newspaper said, citing banking officials.  Frankfurt-based Commerzbank could generate 1 billion euros
($1.4 billion) by retaining profit through June 30 and boosting
its core capital by 3 billion euros by selling 30 billion euros
in risk-weighted assets, the newspaper said, citing options that
the supervisory board will discuss today.  Daimler climbed 1.7 percent to 34.93 euros. The carmaker
plans to cut production costs by 10 percent annually in 2012 and
2013, Reuters reported, citing Wolfgang Nieke, a works council
member.  Salzgitter  rose 1.4 percent to 39.89 euros after WestLB
raised the company’s shares to “buy” from “add.”  Celesio AG  surged 5.5 percent to 12.10 euros. The stock was
raised to “equal weight” from “underweight” at Morgan
Stanley.  Vossloh AG  gained 2.3 percent to 77.09 euros after the
company confirmed its forecast for 2011.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  dropped 6.4 percent to 17.80 euros after
Germany’s largest steelmaker posted a fiscal full-year loss
because of 2.9 billion euros of impairments charges, mostly
after the construction of a plant in  Brazil  was delayed.
ThyssenKrupp posted a loss before interest and taxes of 988
million euros in the year ended Sept. 30, compared with a 1.4
billion-euro profit a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
