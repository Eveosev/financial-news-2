The  U.S. Senate  rejected a Republican
proposal that would extend a payroll  tax cut  to 2012 for
employees, covering the cost by reducing the federal workforce
by 10 percent and freezing pay for federal workers.  Tonight’s 20-78 vote fell short of the 60 votes that were
needed to advance the legislation. The tax cut, which lowered an
employee’s share of the Social Security payroll tax from 6.2
percent to 4.2 percent for 2011, is slated to expire on Dec. 31
unless Congress acts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
