U.S. stocks (SPX)  were little changed,
after wiping out an early rally, as a drop in the jobless rate
to a two-year low wasn’t enough to extend the biggest weekly
advance since March 2009 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Equities headed lower as the largest U.S. companies
including  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  reversed their gains.  Tenet
Healthcare Corp. (THC)  and  Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX)  lost at least 6.8
percent, leading declines in health-care companies. JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  climbed at least 6.1 percent, as
 financial companies (SPXL1)  had the biggest rise among  S&P 500  groups.  The S&P 500 dropped less than 0.1 percent to 1,244.28 as of
4 p.m. New York time, after rising as much as 1.3 percent. The
index rallied 7.4 this week. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
lost 0.61 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,019.42. The
Russell 2000 Index, a measure of the smallest U.S. companies,
jumped 0.6 percent to 735.02.  “It’s another incremental step in the right direction for
the labor market, but we’re still not out of the rut we’ve been
in,” John Canally, who helps oversee about $340 billion as an
economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial Corp. in
 Boston , said in a telephone interview. “More than anything this
is still about Europe.”  The benchmark index for American equities has trimmed its
decline for 2011 to 1.1 percent after rebounding 13 percent from
its low for the year on Oct. 3. Improving U.S. economic data has
helped alleviate concern that the world’s largest economy will
relapse into a recession as Europe’s debt crisis threatens to
derail the recovery.  Economic Surprise  The  Citigroup Economic Surprise Index  for the U.S. has
risen to the highest level since March 9. The gauge, which
measures the rate at which data is beating or missing economist
forecasts, reached 85.7 today and has rebounded from a more-than
two-year low of minus 117.2 in June.  Today’s jobs data showed that payrolls climbed 120,000,
with more than half the hiring coming from retailers and
temporary help agencies, after a revised 100,000 rise in October
that was more than initially estimated. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey called for a gain of 125,000. The jobless
rate declined to 8.6 percent, the lowest since March 2009, from
9 percent, Labor Department figures showed.  “The market anticipated stronger-than-expected data and it
was already discounted,” said Barry Knapp, the New York-based
head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays Plc, said in a
telephone interview. “What typically happens with these macro
surprises is they get to a point where expectations have moved
up and you’re no longer surprising the market.”  More Resources  The  International Monetary Fund  said today it will need
more resources to fight  Europe ’s debt crisis if market
conditions worsen. The S&P 500 has rallied this week as the
 Federal Reserve  and five other central banks lowered the cost of
dollar funding and China cut the proportion that banks need to
hold as  reserve  capital.  Equity futures rose earlier following a report that as much
as 200 billion euros ($270 billion) of national central bank
loans may be channeled through the IMF. Germany and France are
pushing for closer economic ties among euro-area nations and
tougher enforcement of budget rules to counter the region’s debt
crisis.  Financial stocks posted the largest gains out of 10 groups
in the S&P 500, climbing 1.4 percent.  JPMorgan (JPM)  surged 6.1
percent, the biggest rise in the Dow, to $32.33, while Morgan
Stanley rallied 7 percent to $15.52.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  jumped 4.4
percent to $28.17 and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  added 3 percent
to $97.25.  Reversing Gains  Caterpillar, the world’s largest construction and mining-
equipment maker, slid 0.6 percent to $96.29, after rallying as
much as 1.2 percent.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  slumped 0.1 percent to
$101.69, after rising as much as 1.3 percent.  Western Digital  jumped 7.5 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $31.44. The disk-drive maker raised its quarterly
revenue  forecast (WDC)  after sales rebounded from a flood in Thailand
that devastated factories and constrained supplies.  Hospital and medical device stocks tumbled after a report
that insurers who handle Medicare payments in 11 states will
perform audits on hospital stays related to heart and orthopedic
procedures. Hospitals will have to wait 30 to 60 days while
hospital records are reviewed to determine whether procedures
performed during the stay were medically necessary, the Wells
Fargo Securities note said today.  Health-care companies posted the biggest losses as a group
today, falling 1.3 percent. Tenet Healthcare plunged 11 percent
to $4.18. Boston Scientific erased 6.8 percent to $5.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
