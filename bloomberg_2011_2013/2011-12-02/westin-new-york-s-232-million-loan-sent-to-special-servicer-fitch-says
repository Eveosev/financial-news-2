A $232 million loan backed by the
 Westin New York at Times Square , an 863-room hotel in midtown
 Manhattan , was sent to a special servicer today, according to
 Fitch Ratings .  Special servicers often perform workouts for loans that
have become troubled after being sold as commercial mortgage-
backed securities. The Westin loan has a final maturity date of
March 11, 2012, after the hotel’s owner, Tishman Hotel & Realty
LP, exercised three one-year extension options, Fitch said in a
September report.  “We’ve voluntarily opted to have the Westin New York’s
loan transferred into special servicing in order to allow us to
have discussions with the lender about possible refinancing
options,”  John Gallagher , a Tishman spokesman, said in an e-
mail.  The hotel, built in 2002, has 34,000 square feet (3,200
square meters) of meeting space, a fitness center and spa, and a
restaurant, Shula’s Steakhouse, according to the report. The
average occupancy in the year ended in March was 89 percent, and
the average daily rate were $302, according to the report.  Fitch cited imminent default as the reason for today’s
transfer. That generally means “the borrower has requested some
form of relief and expressed hardship,” Adam Fox, a senior
director at the debt-rating company, said in an e-mail.  The master servicer is Bank of America Corp. and the
special servicer is CWCapital Asset Management LLC, according to
Fitch. The Westin brand is owned by  Starwood Hotels & Resorts
Worldwide Inc. (HOT)   To contact the reporter on this story:
