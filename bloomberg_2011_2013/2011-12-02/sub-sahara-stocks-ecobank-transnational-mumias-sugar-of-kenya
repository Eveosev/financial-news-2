than 30 countries, rose for the first day in four, gaining 3.4
percent to 10.65 naira, after it announced getting a $285
million loan to help it finance the acquisition of Oceanic Bank
International Plc, a Nigerian lender bailed out in 2009.  Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG)  , Kenya’s biggest producer of the
sweetener, slumped for a fifth day, tumbling 5.2 percent to 4.60
shillings, the lowest close since June 2009, on concern that it
may have to operate at lower capacity as cane supply falls.  “We have seen cane supply dwindling so much, the company’s
operating capacity may drop from 75 percent now to even 60
percent before the end of the financial year in June,” Deris
Mogoi, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  Sameer Africa Ltd. (SAME)  , a Kenyan tire maker, rose for
the first day in nine, advancing 1.3 percent to 3.9 shillings,
the biggest gain since Nov. 21, after the company said it is
diversifying its revenue base.  To contact the reporter on this story:
