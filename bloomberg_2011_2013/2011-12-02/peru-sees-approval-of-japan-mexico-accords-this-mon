(Corrects expected timing of approval in headline.)  Peru  expects Japanese and Mexican
legislators to approve free-trade agreements this month,
spurring the Andean country’s agricultural and textile exports,
Foreign Trade Minister Jose Silva said.  Speaking in an interview, Silva said he aims to sign an
accord next year with the nine-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership,
or TPP, which includes Australia. Peru, which has agreements in
place with the U.S., the European Union and  China , is also
studying a trade deal with India, he said yesterday from Cuzco,
Peru.  “Agreements cover 94 percent of our trade so we aim to
become Asia’s gateway to South America,” Silva said. “There’s
a will to reach a TPP agreement in 2012.”  Peru, the world’s third-largest copper and zinc exporter
and No. 2 in silver, is seeking to boost exports of cotton
garments, coffee and asparagus to offset sagging commodities
prices. Copper dropped 18 percent to $7,890 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange this year, heading for the first annual
decline since 2008, while zinc slid 16 percent.  The TPP includes the U.S., Australia, Brunei, Chile,
Malaysia,  New Zealand , Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
