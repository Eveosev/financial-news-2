Syria  may be heading for civil war as
the government of President Bashar al-Assad continues a
crackdown on opposition protesters, the  United Nations ’ top
human-rights official said.  “The Syrian authorities’ continual ruthless oppression, if
not stopped now, can drive the country into a full-fledged civil
war,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said
today at a special session of the UN Human Rights Council in
Geneva.  “In light of the manifest failure of the Syrian
authorities to protect their citizens, the international
community needs to take urgent and effective measures to protect
the Syrian people,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
