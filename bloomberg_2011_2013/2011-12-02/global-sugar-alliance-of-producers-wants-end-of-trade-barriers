The European Union and U.S. should
drop trade barriers on sugar and ethanol because they have
caused “price instability,” a sugar producer group said.  Demand for sugar and ethanol is climbing due to  population
growth  and increased wealth, especially in  developing
countries , the Brisbane, Australia-based Global Sugar Alliance
said in a statement today. It represents producers in countries
including Brazil, Thailand and  Australia , the biggest exporters.  “Market restrictions constraining domestic supply are
failing both consumers and sugar users, limiting their ability
to access sugar produced by the world’s most efficient and
lowest cost producers,” Ian Glasson, chairman of the alliance,
said in the statement. Glasson is also chief executive officer
of Sucrogen Ltd., Australia’s biggest raw sugar producer,
according to the company’s website. “The EU continues to
produce and export surplus sugar despite clear evidence of the
negative impact to world market prices of export subsidies.”  The EU has limited the amount of sugar that
local producers can sell within the domestic market after the
bloc’s sugar reform of 2006. Some imports are also limited due
to duties. In the U.S., sugar imports are limited.  “Interventionist sugar policies continue to create price
instability,” the alliance said. “Reform is essential to
ensure that the most efficient producers can increase investment
and production to keep pace with rising global demand and
changing consumer needs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
