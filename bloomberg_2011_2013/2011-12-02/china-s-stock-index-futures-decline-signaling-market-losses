China’s stocks (SHCOMP)  fell, capping a fourth
week of losses for the benchmark index, as sliding property
prices and the slump in manufacturing added to concern the
economic slowdown is deepening.  China Shenhua Energy Co. (601088)  and  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362)  led losses
for energy and material producers, the biggest decliners among
10 industry groups in the CSI 300 Index after utilities.  China
Southern Airlines Co. the largest domestic carrier (600029) , plunged 3.2
percent after the China Securities Journal said the government
raised wholesale jet fuel prices.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, slid 26.20 points, or 1.1 percent, to
2,360.66 at the close. It fell 0.8 percent this week. The CSI
300 lost 1 percent to 2,557.31 today.  The Bloomberg China-US 55
Index  was little changed at 101.09 at the close in  New York .  “Investors remain concerned about the weak economy after
yesterday’s one-day rally,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West
China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “There’s nothing spectacular
that will really push stocks up and there’s the PMI data that
wasn’t reflected yesterday because everyone was focusing on the
reserve ratio cut.”  The Shanghai Composite rose 2.3 percent yesterday, as the
first cut in lenders’ reserve requirements since 2008
overshadowed a report showing the  Purchasing Managers’ Index 
contracted for the first time in two years.  The stocks measure fell 0.8 percent this week, adding to
this year’s 16 percent slump, after the central bank raised
interest rates three times and lifted the reserve-requirement
ratio six times to curb inflation that reached a three-year high
of 6.5 percent in July. The index is valued at 11.2 times
estimated earnings, compared with a four-year average of 17.3
times, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg.  Commodity Stocks  Gauges (SHSZ300)  of energy and material stocks in the CSI 300 lost
more at least 1.8 percent. Jiangxi Copper, the biggest copper
producer, decreased 2.9 percent to 25.59 yuan, while Yanzhou
Coal Mining Co. retreated 2.5 percent to 25.58 yuan. China
Shenhua Energy, the largest coal producer, fell 1.7 percent to
25.61 yuan.  China’s challenge in loosening monetary policy is to
sustain the expansion of the world’s second-largest economy
without spurring price gains, fueling bad loans or reigniting a
real estate boom that has started to deflate. The  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index fell to 49.0 in November from 50.4 in October,
the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said yesterday.
A level below 50 shows contraction.  China  Southern Airlines dropped 3.2 percent to 5.5 yuan.
Rival China Eastern Airlines Corp. retreated 2.3 percent to 4.25
yuan. China raised wholesale jet fuel prices by 376 yuan per ton
to 7,653 yuan per ton in December, the China Securities Journal
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Property Slump  China’s home prices fell for a third month in November as
developers started to cut prices to boost sales amid the
government’s housing curbs, according to SouFun Holdings Ltd.
Home prices dropped 0.28 percent last month from October, when
they retreated 0.23 percent, SouFun, the nation’s biggest real
estate website owner, said yesterday.  Shanghai home transactions by area slumped 53 percent last
month from a year earlier,  Shanghai  Securities News reported
today, citing data from Shanghai Deovolente Realty.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  has said the government won’t relax
property curbs after raising down-payment and mortgage
requirements and imposing home purchase restrictions in about 40
cities this year to avert a bubble.  Rate Outlook  “China does have scope to cushion the downturn through
fiscal and selective monetary easing,” said Masha Gordon, the
head of  emerging markets  equity portfolio management at Pacific
Investment Management Co., which oversees about $1.35 trillion
worldwide. “The key, as always, is whether policy makers manage
to stay ahead of the market. This may prove to challenging.”  Eleven economists of 19 in a Bloomberg News survey
conducted yesterday say  interest rates  will stay unchanged
through next year and another three predict increases. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc are among five that see
cuts.  China, the world’s second-largest economy,  expanded  9.1
percent in the third quarter from a year ago, the least in two
years. The growth will slow to 8.5 percent next year, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a
Nov. 29 report, down from its May forecast of 9.2 percent.  Citigroup Inc. forecast Chinese stocks to be “range-
bound” for most of 2012, with A shares to trade from 2,400 to
2,800 and reaching as high as 3,200. H shares may trade between
10,700 and 12,000 next year and reach a high of 14,000,
according to a report yesterday by Minggao Shen, head of Chinese
research at Citigroup.  B Shares  The Shanghai SE B Share Index, whose shares are traded in
U.S. dollars, dropped 3.5 percent today. The measure slid 8.4
percent this week, the most in almost six months on fund
outflows, concerns about the introduction of the Shanghai
International Board and speculation yuan appreciation will slow.  Emerging-market equity funds had withdrawals of $500
million, Citigroup Inc. analyst  Markus Rosgen  wrote in a
report dated today. China was the “hardest hit” among Asian
countries with outflows of $300 million, the report said.  Strategists predict the yuan will be the worst performer of
currencies in the biggest emerging markets over the next four
months as sluggish exports curb appreciation. China’s currency
will advance 1.6 percent to 6.27 per dollar by the end of March,
based on the median of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg
as of Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
