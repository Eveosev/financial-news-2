Indianapolis Colts quarterback  Peyton Manning  will be allowed to increase the intensity of his
workouts as he recovers from neck surgery.  The Colts, winless this season in 11 games, have kept
Manning on the active roster in case the four-time National
Football League Most Valuable Player can return.  “Examination of the surgical area shows that the fusion
performed in September has achieved firm fixation,” Dr. Robert
Watkins said yesterday in a statement released by the team.
“Peyton will now be allowed to increase the intensity and
breadth of his workouts as tolerated.”  Watkins declined to establish a timetable for when Manning,
35, can return to practice with the team.  “I am encouraged with what Doc had to say,” Manning said
in a statement on the Colts’ website. “I am hopeful for
continued progress in this next phase of my rehab.”  Manning, who had three neck surgeries in nine months,
hasn’t played this season.  The  New England Patriots  (8-3) host the Colts on Dec. 4.
The Patriots are 21-point favorites to win, the NFL’s biggest
point spread since 2007 and the 10th time in 33 years that a
team has been favored by oddsmakers by more than 20 points,
according to Las Vegas-based handicapping information website
