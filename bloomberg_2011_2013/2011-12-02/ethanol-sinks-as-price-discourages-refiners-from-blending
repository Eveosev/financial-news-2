Ethanol futures sank in  Chicago  as
its price compared to gasoline reduced blending demand and as
corn declined.  Futures fell two days after the Energy Department reported
 production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol  plunged
the most in six months last week. The additive averaged a 3.6-
cent premium to gasoline in November, versus a 22-cent discount
over the past year that refiners were able to pocket in addition
to a 45-cent credit for each gallon mixed with the motor fuel.  “You’ve got everything kind of pressed against you and I
think you can see that in the last EIA report,” said Jerrod
Kitt, an analyst at the Linn Group in Chicago. “On the West
Coast, you were probably paying money to blend ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 2.4 cents, or
1 percent, to $2.503 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 5.3 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago slid 3 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.68 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel
dropped 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.795, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf decreased 1.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.805 and on the West Coast the additive increased
1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.805.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
tumbled 3.7 percent to 4.94 million barrels a day, the biggest
drop and lowest amount since May 6.  Ethanol prices have fallen 10 percent since Nov. 2 when its
premium to gasoline rose to 15.88 cents, the highest level since
November 2010. Ethanol’s discount to gasoline widened to 11.32
cents today, the most since Oct. 14.  Corn for March delivery tumbled 6.25 cents, or 1 percent,
to $5.9525 a bushel in Chicago. The grain is the primary input
for making ethanol in the U.S.  Prices for the feedstock fell on speculation global demand
for U.S. supply will wane, Kitt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
