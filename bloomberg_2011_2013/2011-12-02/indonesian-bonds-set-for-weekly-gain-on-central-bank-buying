Indonesia ’s bonds advanced, snapping
a two-week decline, after the  central bank  said it would buy the
securities in the secondary market to help stem losses in the
rupiah. The currency snapped four weeks of losses.  Bank Indonesia  is committed to buying  government bonds  in
the secondary market Perry Warjiyo, director for economic
research and monetary policy, said Nov. 29. The monetary
authority plans to boost “intervention” to support the rupiah,
Governor Darmin Nasution said Nov. 30, a day after the currency
sank to a 17-month low. The rupiah strengthened 0.5 percent
yesterday, its best performance since October.  “To restore stability, Bank Indonesia is intervening in
the market whenever necessary,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a
Singapore-based currency strategist at Malayan Banking
Bhd. “That is giving a lot of confidence to investors.”  The yield on the government’s benchmark 8.25 percent notes
due July 2021 fell 60 basis points, or 0.60 percentage point,
this week to 6.21 percent today, according to the midday prices
by Inter-Dealer Market Association. The rate dropped 36 basis
points today.  The rupiah advanced 0.2 percent this week to 9,038 per
dollar this week as of 3:44 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency reached
9,240 on Nov. 29, the weakest level since June 2010. It gained
0.6 percent today.  Bank Indonesia unexpectedly cut its benchmark  interest rate 
by 50 basis points to 6 percent on Nov. 10. The next central
bank policy meeting is due Dec. 8.  Consumer prices in Indonesia rose 4.15 percent from a year
earlier, from a gain of 4.42 percent in October, according to a
report by the Central Bureau of Statistics. The median estimate
of 18 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 4.2
percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
