The ruble weakened for a second day,
the biggest drop in more than a week, against the dollar as
hopes diminished that coordinated action by central banks would
bring a solution to  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 30.851 at
the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest fall since Nov. 23, and
pared its weekly appreciation to 2.1 percent. The ruble was 0.3
percent weaker at 41.61 per euro, leaving it also down 0.3
percent at 35.6926 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said yesterday that the
euro area would risk “exploding” if members fail to converge
on fiscal policies, while German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
today the European currency needs a “firm foundation” as the
region’s economic growth slows. The EU is Russia’s largest
trading partner.  “External dynamics are driving the ruble,” Peter
Rosenstreich, chief currency analyst at Swissquote Bank SA in
Geneva, said in an e-mail. “I don’t see much changing, or that
the coordinated action was a game-changer. Europe will still be
struggling with deteriorating growth.”  The U.S. Federal Reserve and five other central banks cut
the European lenders’ cost of borrowing dollars for emergency
funding on Nov. 30.  Swissquote expects the ruble to depreciate as much as 3.5
percent to about 37 against the basket by the end of this year.
Investors increased bets the ruble would weaken today, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.3215 per dollar
in three months.  The yield on  Russia ’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2020
declined 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 4.284
percent today. On the country’s only ruble Eurobond due 2018, it
fell four basis points to 7.192 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
