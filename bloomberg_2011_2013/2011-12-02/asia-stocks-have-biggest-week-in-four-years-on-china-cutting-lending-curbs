Asian stocks rose, with a regional
index recording its biggest weekly advance since August 2007, as
 China  reduced curbs on lending and the  Federal Reserve  led
central banks in cutting funding costs for European lenders.  Shanghai-based  China Shipping Container Lines Co. (2866)  gained
the most this week, surging 32 percent in  Hong Kong  trading.

its reserve requirements. Samsung Electronics Co., South Korea’s
biggest exporter of consumer electronics, rallied 11 percent

data is still supportive of the scenario,” said Ng Soo Nam,
Singapore-based chief investment officer at Nikko Asset
Management Asia Ltd., which oversees about $165 billion.
“Market volatility will continue because problems in Europe
cannot be resolved easily. The coordination from central banks
was a very big attempt to stabilize the market and that should
help moderate the volatility.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 8 percent to 117.66, the
biggest weekly advance since Aug. 24, 2007. The index nearly
erased the month of losses, rising to its highest level since

levels since July. The  HSI Volatility Index  plunged 23 percent
this week to 27.7 in Hong Kong, suggesting options traders see a
swing of 8 percent in the Hang Seng Index in the next 30 days.
The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index dropped 20 percent to
23.42 and the Kospi 200 Volatility Index fell 18 percent this
week.  China Manufacturing Slows  China’s  Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SHCOMP)  was the
only decliner of the major Asian indexes, falling 0.8 percent as
China’s manufacturing recorded the weakest performance since the
global recession eased in 2009.  Australia’s benchmark  S&P/ASX 200  surged 7.6 percent, the
biggest weekly advance since Nov. 28, 2008. Hong Kong’s Hang

percent. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 5.9 percent this
week while the broader Topix Index increased 5.3 percent.  China Shipping Container Lines surged 32 percent to

largest mainland developer listed in Hong Kong, jumped 20
percent to HK$14.7.  “There’s an increased appetite toward risks,” said John Woods, Hong Kong-based chief Asian strategist at Citigroup

bring some relief to liquidity-starved developers in the
mainland.”  Exporters advanced after Thanksgiving weekend sales in the
