Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K.’s largest homebuilder by market value, said first-half
profit jumped 67 percent as the company sold more homes and
raised money from the sale of a student residence project in
London. The shares rose to the highest in about five months.  Net income climbed to 74.3 million pounds ($117 million),
or 53.7 pence a share, in the six months through October from
44.5 million pounds, or 32.8 pence, a year earlier, the Cobham,
England-based company said in a statement today. The project’s
sale means full-year earnings per share will probably beat
analysts’ estimates, Managing Director Rob Perrins said in the
statement.  Berkeley, the best-performing U.K. homebuilder this year,
has benefited by concentrating on  London  and southeast  England ,
where  house prices  have been the most resilient as the  economy 
falters. Values in London will fall 0.5 percent next year,
beating a 2 percent drop for the rest of the U.K., real estate
broker Savills Plc predicted last month.  Profit was boosted by a 30.7 million-pound gain on
September’s sale of a 51 percent stake in a student
accommodation project near London’s Clapham Junction railroad
station.  Berkeley gained 21 pence, or 1.7 percent, to 1,288 pence at
8:32 a.m. in London trading, the highest since July 4. Before
today, the shares had risen 42 percent this year compared with a
16 percent increase for the seven members of the  Bloomberg EMEA
Homebuilders Index. (BEUHBLD)   Prices Fall  The company sold 1,506 homes, 21 percent more than a year
earlier. The average price of 254,000 pounds was 3 percent
lower, although this will rise in the second half and through
next year because of the company’s more expensive projects in
central London, Perrins said in an interview.  Forward sales rose by 15 percent to 937.2 million pounds.
The company’s first-half operating margin of 18.9 percent
compared with 17.4 percent a year earlier.  “Our forward sales give us confidence about the outlook
over the next 18 months,” Perrins said, adding that outside
London visitor numbers to its sales sites were 40 percent lower
than in 2007 at the height of the housing market boom.  Berkeley acquired 1,271 plots of land in the first half,
taking its land holdings to 26,404 plots valued at 2.46 billion
pounds. Its St. George Central London Ltd. division is one of
three companies shortlisted to redevelop Silvertown Quays in the
U.K. capital’s East End.  “We see a further margin improvement as the lower cost
land, acquired during the recession, starts to come into
production,” said Simon Brown, an analyst at Northland Capital
Partners, in a note to investors. Brown has a “buy” rating on
the stock.  The homebuilder had net cash of 13.9 million pounds at the
end of October, down from 42 million pounds on April 30. The
construction company expects to be “modestly geared” in the
second half of the fiscal year as it acquires more land,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
