The  German car market ,  Europe ’s
largest, probably won’t grow next year as the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis saps  consumer confidence .  Sales in 2012 will probably hold steady at 3.1 million
vehicles after rising about 8 percent this year, the German
auto-industry association VDA said today at a press conference
in Berlin. Production by the country’s carmakers is projected
also to be flat at 5.9 million vehicles.  “We are expecting more headwinds,” VDA President Matthias Wissmann said. “2012 will be a hard year.”  German car manufacturers are bracing for a slowdown in
demand, while the DIW research institute has predicted the
economy may slide into recession over the next two quarters.
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  said on Oct. 28 that it’s prepared
to reduce production by as much as 30 percent.  Daimler AG  said
Oct. 27 that production flexibility enables it to “react
quickly to future developments.”  The western European car market will remain unchanged at
12.8 million vehicles next year as long as the economy remains
stable, the VDA said. If tensions on financial markets don’t
ease, a “slight” decline is possible, Wissmann said.  “We’re confident overall for 2012, if financial markets
are stabilized and the European debt crisis gets under
control,” he said.  China ’s car market may rise 8 percent to 13.2 million
vehicles in 2012, slowing from growth of 30 percent to 40
percent in recent years, Wissmann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
