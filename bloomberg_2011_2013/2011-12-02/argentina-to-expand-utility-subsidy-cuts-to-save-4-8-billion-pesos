Argentina ’s government will expand
the scope of reductions to utility subsidies announced last
month to bring its total savings to 4.8 billion pesos ($1.1
billion).  The government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
will use those savings to boost public works and not to lower
 spending , said Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  in a news
conference in Buenos Aires.  “This is not a fiscal issue, this means a re-directing of
subsidies to a higher volume of public works and public
services,” said Boudou.  The South American country began a policy of subsidies and
freezing utility rates after the government’s 2001 default on
$95 billion in bonds and its decision to drop the peso’s one-to-
one peg that led Argentina’s currency to lose about two-thirds
of its value in 2002.  Last month, the government announced the elimination of
subsidies used by the country’s largest oil refining, natural
gas processing, agrochemical and bio-fuel companies, as well as
to the wealthiest neighborhoods.  “Subsidies were a result of the catastrophe that Argentina
suffered in 2001,” said Planning Minister Julio De Vido, who
detailed the new round of subsidy cuts that take effect Jan. 1.  The 4.8 billion pesos savings include the elimination of
subsidies to buildings owned by the city of  Buenos Aires  as well
as for street lighting, De Vido said.  Consumers in other neighborhoods will be able to fill out a
questionnaire in order to show they need to continue receiving
the subsidies, De Vido said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
