OAO Lukoil ,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, plans to build a fluid catalytic cracker at its
Nizhny Novgorod refinery that is a duplicate of one that started
last year, a company official said.  “The project has been fast-tracked and is expected to be
complete in 2014 or 2015,” Mikhail Antonov, director of
refining for Lukoil’s Litasco subsidiary, said yesterday at the
World Refining Association conference in Geneva.  The catalytic cracker will have a capacity of 2 million
metric tons a year, or 40,000 barrels a day. “We are focusing
on production of motor fuels,” Antonov said.  Russia, the world’s largest crude oil producer, experienced
gasoline shortages earlier this year, which led to the
government raising the export duty on the fuel from May.  The catalytic cracker at the Nizhny Novgorod refinery
opened last year, allowing it to produce so-called Euro-5
standard gasoline in May. The refinery, east of Moscow,
makes only Euro-4 and Euro-5 grade.  Euro-4 standard gasoline contains no more than 50 parts per
million of sulfur. Euro-5 has a 10-ppm limit. A lower sulfur
content reduces pollution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
