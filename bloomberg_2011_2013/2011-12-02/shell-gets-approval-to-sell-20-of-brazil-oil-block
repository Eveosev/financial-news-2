Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil company by market value, received approval to sell a
20 percent stake in the BM-S-8 oil license in deep waters off
the coast of Brazil.  Shell is selling 10 percent of the license to Barra Energia
Petroleo e Gas and another 10 percent to  QGEP Participacoes SA ,
the country’s oil regulator said today on its website. The
regulator didn’t give the value of the transaction.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state controlled producer
which operates the exploration area, announced a discovery of
“good quality” oil in the area on Nov. 30 and said it shortly
plans to drill a third well. The block holds the Bem-Te-Vi
discovery.  Mergers and acquisitions in  Brazil ’s oil industry have
accelerated over the past two years with companies including BP
Plc, Sinochem Group and China Petrochemical Corp. buying assets.  The country, home to the largest discovery in the Western
Hemisphere in the past three decades, plans to more than double
crude production by 2020.  Shell announced plans to sell the stake on July 5.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
