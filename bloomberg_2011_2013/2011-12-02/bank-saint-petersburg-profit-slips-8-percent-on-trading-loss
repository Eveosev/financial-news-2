Bank Saint Petersburg , a regional
Russian lender, said third-quarter profit fell 8 percent because
of trading losses.  Net income dropped to 1.1 billion rubles ($36 million) from
1.2 billion rubles a year earlier, the company said in a
statement today. The firm posted a 661.8 billion-ruble trading
loss in the period.  “The third quarter was not an easy one both for the
economy and the bank,” Alexander Savelyev, chairman of the
lender’s management board, said in the statement. “The
financial markets were significantly affected by the situation
in  Europe  and our customers started to feel the environment
getting worse.”  The bank plans to refinance $75 million in subordinated
debt due at the end of January, Deputy Chief Executive
Konstantin Balandin said on a conference call.  Net income for nine months increased to 5.6 billion rubles
from 2.3 billion in the year-earlier period.  Bank Saint Petersburg rose 0.6 percent to 85 rubles by 4:30
p.m. in Moscow trading, paring an earlier gain of as much as 5.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
