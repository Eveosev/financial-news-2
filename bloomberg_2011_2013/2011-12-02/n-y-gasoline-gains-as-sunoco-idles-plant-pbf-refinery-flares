New York gasoline strengthened for
the first time in four days after  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  said it plans to
idle the 194,000-barrel-a-day Marcus Hook refinery and PBF
Energy Partners LP reported emissions at its  Delaware  City
refinery in Delaware.  Sunoco will increase operating rates at its Philadelphia
refinery as the Marcus Hook plant is idled, the Philadelphia-
based company said in a statement yesterday. PBF reported an
electrical failure on a motor that resulted in flaring,
according to filing with state regulators today.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in  New York  rose
0.37 cent to a premium of 0.75 cent a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:16 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained
5.67 cents a gallon.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel versus heating
oil futures rose 0.13 cent to 1.88 cents a gallon at the hub.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  released emissions at its Corpus
Christi West refinery in Texas yesterday because of an equipment
malfunction at Complex Four, according to a filing to state
regulators.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  narrowed 0.75 cent to 5.75 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
