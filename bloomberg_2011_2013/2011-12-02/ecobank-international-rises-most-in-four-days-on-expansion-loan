Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , which
operates in more than 30 countries, rose the most in four days
after it obtained a loan to pave the way for a share swap with
 South Africa ’s  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  and help finance the purchase
of  Oceanic Bank International Plc. (OCEANIC)   The stock gained 3 percent at 10.65 naira by the 2:30 p.m.
close in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital.  Nedbank , controlled by Old Mutual Plc, provided the $285
million loan, the two lenders said in a joint e-mailed statement
yesterday. Oceanic is a Nigerian lender bailed out by the
central bank in 2009.  The agreement allows Nedbank to acquire a 20 percent stake
in Lome, Togo-based Ecobank over the next two to three years.
Ecobank would take a “reciprocal” stake in Nedbank, the two
lenders said.  Ecobank shares have lost 32 percent of their value this
year, compared with a 20.5 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange  All-Share Index (NGSEINDX)  over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
