Oil tankers able to haul a combined
8.78 million barrels a day went to  Saudi Arabia ’s  Ras Tanura ,
the world’s largest crude-export terminal, ship-tracking data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Vessels with a total capacity of 8.38 million deadweight
tons were at Ras Tanura from Nov. 20 to Nov. 26, 8.1 percent
less than the previous seven-day period, the data show. To
estimate that tonnage in terms of barrels a day, the figure was
multiplied by 7.33 to calculate the total barrels and then
divided by seven, the number of days in the period.  China will get the largest share of shipments, with five
loadings during the period. Very large crude carriers with a
combined capacity of 1.5 million tons, or 11 million barrels,
are heading for the country after loading at the terminal. Two
cargoes are bound for  South Korea  and one for  Japan .  Following are the ships that loaded at Ras Tanura, the
companies that hired them and estimated times of arrival, where
data are available. Drafts are expressed as a percentage of
maximum sailing depth and are an indication of cargo size.  To contact the reporter on this story:
