The Canadian dollar fell for the
first time in seven days on speculation its rally this week will
be hard to sustain after a report showed employers unexpectedly
reduced jobs in November.  The loonie, as the currency is also known, depreciated 0.2
percent to C$1.0158 per  U.S. dollar  in Toronto, paring its
weekly increase to 3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
