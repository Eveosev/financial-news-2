China ZhengTong Auto Services
Holdings Ltd. (1728)  fell to the lowest in more than five weeks in Hong
Kong trading on speculation the company may have to raise funds
after its proposed acquisition of a luxury-car distributor.  ZhengTong, a distributor of BMW and Porsche cars in  China ,
declined 5.6 percent to HK$7.49, the lowest close since Oct. 24.
The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.2 percent.  The Hong Kong-based company will acquire Top Globe Ltd., a
luxury car dealer in China, for 5.5 billion yuan ($867 million),
according to a statement to the stock exchange yesterday. The
deal is subject to board approval, it said.  ZhengTong may have to sell new shares to raise 1.5 billion
yuan for “short-term liquidity requirements,” Steve Man, a
Hong Kong-based analyst at Samsung Securities Co., wrote in a
report dated yesterday. “The market continues to be concerned
about the company’s raising capital,” which is “dilutive,” he
wrote.  Kelly Fung, an external public relations representative for
ZhengTong, said the company declined to comment on speculation
about fundraising and the drop in the share price.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
