A congressman leading an
investigation into a law enforcement program that allowed
illegal gun purchases in the U.S. said he may recommend moving
the government’s firearms enforcement agency into the FBI.  U.S. Representative  Darrell Issa , chairman of the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said today that
Congress must reorganize the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives, which ran the operation called “Fast
and Furious.” The program was created in an effort to link the
illegally purchased weapons to Mexican drug cartels.  “ATF, perhaps, should be molded completely into the FBI
and be done with it,” Issa, a California Republican, told
reporters at a breakfast in Washington sponsored by the
Christian Science Monitor. “There is no reason you can’t have a
special unit under the FBI” that investigates federal firearms
laws.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and ATF are both part
of the  Justice Department . Attorney General Eric Holder has said
that the operation was “flawed” and that its tactics shouldn’t
be used again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
