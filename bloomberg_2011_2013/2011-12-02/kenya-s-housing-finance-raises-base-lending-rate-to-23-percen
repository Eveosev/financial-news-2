Housing Finance Ltd. (HFCL) , Kenya’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, has raised its base lending
rate to 23 percent for new customers, while existing customers
will pay 16.5 percent, up from 14 percent.  “Despite Central Bank increasing its lending rate by 11
percent over the last three months, we have decided to only
increase our rate for existing customers by a small margin since
we are in a long-term relationship,” Managing Director, Frank Ireri said in an emailed statement today.  Kenya’s central bank yesterday raised its benchmark
 interest rate  for a fourth consecutive time by 1.5 percentage
points to 18 percent to help curb inflation that’s more than
double the government’s target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
