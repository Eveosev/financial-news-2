Early in the morning on Nov. 25,  Ren Zhiqiang  -- one of  China ’s wealthiest, most famous and arguably  most detested  real estate developers -- posted a question to his 5 million followers on Sina Weibo, China’s most popular microblog. He  asked : “Is there any country in history that has managed to grow its economy stably after a property bust?” This was no philosophical inquiry. Over the course of the last two months, government officials have tried to turn China’s heated property market into something more equitable for middle-class home buyers. As a result, they have  forced  home prices  down in at least 33 cities. That would be bad enough for Ren Zhiqiang -- and the many  Chinese homeowners  who now find themselves with negative equity. But for Ren, what makes it considerably worse is that this crash is, in large part, a bureaucrat’s bet that the long-term health of the Chinese economy is best served by purposely tanking the real estate market now, rather than waiting for it to tank on its own. He  took obvious exception  to this on Weibo: One could be excused for thinking the macroeconomic adjustments were to lower property prices, but the intention is unquestionably to help stabilize economic development and slow inflation. It’s a bold gamble by China's leaders -- and it suggests an almost unfathomable confidence that the Chinese economy can sustain a significant blow to its property sector, which accounts for  12 percent  of GDP. This is quite the shift: Only months ago, newspaper writers, bloggers and microbloggers were questioning if China had a property bubble. Today, everyone's talking of breathtaking declines in property values as if they’re talking about the declining fortunes of the  Chinese national soccer team . Take, for example, the long  Nov. 29 article , “Will Housing Prices Fall 40%? Predictions by Real Estate Industry Leaders and Public Officials,” in China Economic Weekly, one of the country’s oldest news weeklies (published by  People’s Daily , the self-proclaimed Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece). The story featured industry and government experts' predictions on just how far China’s residential real-estate market could fall. In the article, a “senior official” with the Real Estate Association of China first predicted a modest 10 percent tumble for China's major cities -- Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen -- by the end of 2011. Other experts later offered predictions that housing prices would drop about 25 percent. But then Cao Jinhai, an economist with the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , arrived to represent the “more than 40 percent” camp. He  said : Anywhere else in the world, a government-mediated 40 percent decline in property values would, presumably, not be spoken of with such a dispassionate tone. But on editorial pages across China, the tone is not only dispassionate, it is almost universally affirmative. On Nov. 29, Beijing Youth Daily, the official newspaper of the powerful Communist Youth League, published “A Minimum Price Drop of 50% Is Acceptable.” It  read : New Century Weekly, an independent publication that enjoys considerable autonomy to criticize government policy making,  celebrated and endorsed  the policies responsible for much of the current decline in property prices in an unsigned editorial on Nov. 18. But unlike publications more closely tied to the government, it managed to avoid recommending acceptable decline rates: What’s so striking about editorials like these is the extreme confidence in the Chinese economy that underlies them, but there are plenty of reasons to believe that such confidence is warranted. Terry Ng is a director of  Ding Fung Limited , a rapidly expanding, family-owned scrap metal import and processing company in Foshan, a booming southern city of 3.5 million. On Nov. 21, Ng drove me to his newest facility through a tangle of construction cranes, delivery trucks and new high-rises in the city’s Nanhai district. The pace of construction there had recently accelerated, despite tight credit controls and other efforts to strangle China’s real estate market. He told me, with a rueful smile, that the price of residential property per square meter in this part of town had declined to $1,560 from $2,340 in just a few months. Ng’s business is tightly connected to the global and local markets for aluminum and copper, metals that play a key role in building modern apartments. But when I asked if he was concerned, he shrugged. “It’s okay," he said. "It just means that people who couldn’t afford a house can buy one now.” To many like Ng, mass urbanization combined with cultural drivers -- such as a  long-standing belief  that homeownership should be a prerequisite to any marriage -- will support the market once the speculators are gone. Not everyone in China is so sanguine. Many believe that the government’s policies will cause real damage to China’s economy and society in the short- and long-term. Qiu Zhenhai, a commentator on Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV, a station with close ties to Beijing,  tweeted  on Sina Weibo: To the government's dismay, new home owners, confronted with a sharp decline in the value of their properties,  have taken to protesting  against property developers who have adjusted prices downward. These protests show  no signs of letting up . They may also have been one reason why, on Nov. 30, China’s central bank surprised many with a  technical measure  that should spur bank lending. Observers like Xu Xianan, a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, are deeply concerned that Beijing's continued market interventions will only exacerbate social tensions. Xu  tweeted  on Sina Weibo: As Chinese bureaucrats attempt to regulate a more equitable distribution of housing in China, this might be the important lesson yet to be learned.
