The yuan halted a three-week loss as
the dollar weakened following the move by global central banks
to cut interbank-funding rates in the U.S. currency.  The People’s Bank of  China  raised the reference rate for
the yuan by 0.07 percent to 6.3310 per dollar, the strongest
level since Nov. 14. China lowered the amount of cash banks must
set aside as reserves this week for the first time in three
years to prop up growth, a day before a purchasing managers’
index showed manufacturing in  Asia ’s biggest economy contracted.  “Stronger fixings by the PBOC reflect more on the
weakening of the dollar than any faster appreciation pace,”
said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB. “China has less reason to appreciate the currency
with a big slowdown in export growth and the yuan is getting
close to fair value.”  The yuan advanced 0.24 percent this week and 0.06 percent
today to close at 6.3597 per dollar in  Shanghai , according to
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency may gain
to 6.2 next year, Kowalczyk said, trimming an earlier forecast
of 6.05.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks the greenback against
currencies of six major trading partners, declined 1.8 percent
this week, the biggest drop in almost two months. China set its
daily yuan fixing stronger for a third day today, with the
currency reaching 6.3627 earlier, the lower end of the 0.5
percent range in which it’s allowed to trade.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.01 percent
to 6.3838, paring gains this week to 0.2 percent. Twelve-month
non-deliverable forwards gained 0.02 percent today to 6.3810, a
0.3 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  Reserve ratios for China’s biggest banks will drop 0.5
percentage point to 21 percent effective Dec. 5. China may cut
them further by as much as three percentage points in the next
12 months, Masha Gordon, the head of emerging-markets equity
portfolio management at Pacific Investment Management Co., said
in an interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
