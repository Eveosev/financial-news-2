Pakistan  has taken measures to
prepare for a possible attack by U.S. forces, Germany’s  Bild-
Zeitung  reported, citing a classified document by the U.S.
government’s Combined Joint Intelligence Operations Center.  Pakistan has set up defensive positions in the border
region with Afghanistan in response to an attack the country’s
military sees as potentially imminent, Bild cited the document
as saying.  Numerous anti-aircraft radar installations are in place to
track low-flying vehicles, increasing Pakistan’s capability to
spot helicopters and drones, Bild said.  Afghanistan will suffer a civil war once the  International
Security Assistance Force  leaves the country, Bild also
reported, citing U.S. military intelligence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
