Aimed at reclaiming  Jerusalem  for
Christians, the First Crusade (1096-1099) was a long, tough
march. By the time they reached Ma’arra, in northwestern  Syria ,
some of the hungry European troops resorted to cannibalism.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  A crusader from Chartres wrote of the many men who “cut
pieces from the buttocks of the Saracens.” He continued: “Even
if they were barely warmed over they savagely filled their
mouths and devoured them.”  Proud of their exploits, some Crusaders boasted about
putting adults to boil in the stewpot, while impaling children
on spits to roast over the fire.  To back them up, they had the Old Testament, where
cannibalism was a useful combat tool. The prophet Isaiah says,
“I will feed your enemies with their own flesh, and like new
wine, they shall be drunk with their own blood.”  I spoke with Jay Rubenstein, author of “Armies of Heaven:
The First Crusade and the Quest for Apocalypse,” on the
following topics:  1. Christianizing Jerusalem  2. Apocalyptic Battles  3. Siege of Antioch  4. Final Conquest  5. West vs. East  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
