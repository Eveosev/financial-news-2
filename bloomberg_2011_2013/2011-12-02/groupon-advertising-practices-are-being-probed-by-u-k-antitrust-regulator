Groupon Inc ., the largest Internet
daily-deal site, is being investigated by Britain’s competition
regulator over concerns including unfair promotions and
exaggerated savings.  The U.K.  Office of Fair Trading  has been investigating
Groupon’s British unit since July and expanded the probe after
receiving a complaint from the country’s advertising watchdog.  “Given Groupon’s track record, we have serious concerns
about its ability to adhere to the advertising code,” the
Advertising Standards Authority said in a statement. “It is in
the public interest that we refer the matter to the OFT.”  Groupon, based in  Chicago , raised $700 million selling 35
million shares at $20 each on Nov. 3, the biggest IPO by a U.S.
Internet company since Google Inc. first sold shares in 2004.
Groupon rose 8.3 percent yesterday to $18.95 in New York
trading.  “We are constantly evolving business process to ensure
customers receive the best possible experience at the highest
standards,” a Groupon spokesperson said in an e-mailed
statement. “We are cooperating fully with the OFT to ensure
that the rights of consumers are protected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
