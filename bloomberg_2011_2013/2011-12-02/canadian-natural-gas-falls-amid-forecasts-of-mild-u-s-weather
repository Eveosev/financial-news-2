Canadian natural gas declined amid
speculation that mild U.S. weather will pare consumption.  Alberta  gas fell 1.5 percent after forecasters including
Weather Derivatives predicted lower-than-normal heating needs.
Demand for heat across the U.S. will trail normal by 5 percent
through Dec. 9, the Belton, Missouri-based forecaster said.
Chicago’s high will touch 46 degrees Fahrenheit (8 Celsius) Dec.
4, 7 degrees warmer than normal, AccuWeather Inc. forecast.  “There’s no weather and production has been growing,”
said Ron Denhardt, vice president of natural gas services for
Strategic Energy & Economic Research Inc. in Winchester,
 Massachusetts .  Alberta gas for January delivery fell 4.75 cents to C$3.205
per gigajoule ($2.99 per million British thermal units) as of
3:35 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for January delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 6.4 cents, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $3.584 per
million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
declined 7.23 cents, or 2 percent, to $3.5082 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 6.32 cents to $3.4549, according to ICE. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas was down 0.35 cent to $3.4935 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was at 16.5 billion
cubic feet, 5 million under its target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.79 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.97 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 754 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.97 billion cubic feet today, about 72 percent of its
capacity of 2.72 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.81
billion cubic feet at 12:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
