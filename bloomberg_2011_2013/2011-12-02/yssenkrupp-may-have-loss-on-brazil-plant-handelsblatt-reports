ThyssenKrupp AG  may lose more than
500 million euros ($673 million) because of faulty construction
at its steel plant in  Brazil ,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
unidentified people close to the company.  A new coke oven built by  China ’s Citic Group probably won’t
reach full capacity because of the problem, the newspaper said.  ThyssenKrupp, based in Essen,  Germany , has asked Citic for
compensation and although the Chinese company has in principle
agreed to shoulder part of the costs, the two companies haven’t
yet agreed on the amount, Handelsblatt reported.  Two calls to ThyssenKrupp’s press office by Bloomberg News
weren’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
