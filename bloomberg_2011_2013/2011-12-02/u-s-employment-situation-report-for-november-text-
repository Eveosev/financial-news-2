Following is the text of the
November
employment report from the Labor Department.  The  unemployment rate  fell by 0.4 percentage point to
8.6 percent in November, and nonfarm payroll employment rose
by 120,000, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported
today. Employment continued to trend up in retail trade,
leisure and hospitality, professional and business services,
and health care. Government employment continued to trend
down.  Household Survey Data  In November, the unemployment rate declined by 0.4
percentage point to 8.6 percent. From April through October,
the rate held in a narrow range from 9.0 to 9.2 percent. The
number of unemployed persons, at 13.3 million, was down by
594,000 in November. The labor force, which is the sum of
the unemployed and employed, was down by a little more than
half that amount.  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate
for adult men fell by 0.5 percentage point to 8.3 percent in
November. The jobless rate for whites (7.6 percent) also
declined, while the rates for adult women (7.8 percent),
teenagers (23.7 percent), blacks (15.5 percent), and
Hispanics (11.4 percent) showed little or no change. The
jobless rate for Asians was 6.5 percent, not seasonally
adjusted.  In November, the number of job losers and persons who
completed temporary jobs declined by 432,000 to 7.6 million.
The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27
weeks and over) was little changed at 5.7 million and
accounted for 43.0 percent of the unemployed.  The civilian  labor force  participation rate declined by
0.2 percentage point to 64.0 percent. The employment-
population ratio, at 58.5 percent, changed little.  The number of persons employed part time for economic
reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time
workers) dropped by 378,000 over the month to 8.5 million.
These individuals were working part time because their hours
had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-
time job.  In November, 2.6 million persons were marginally
attached to the labor force, about the same as a year
earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These
individuals were not in the labor force, wanted and were
available for work, and had looked for a job sometime in the
prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because
they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the
survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 1.1 million
discouraged workers in November, a decrease of 186,000 from
a year earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.)
Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for
work because they believe no jobs are available for them.
The remaining 1.5 million persons marginally attached to the
labor force in November had not searched for work in the 4
weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school
attendance or family responsibilities.  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 120,000
in November, in line with the average gain for the prior 12
months (+131,000). The private sector added 140,000 jobs, as
employment rose in a number of service-providing industries.
Government employment continued to trend down.  Employment in retail trade rose by 50,000 in November,
with much of the increase occurring in clothing and clothing
accessories stores (+27,000) and in electronics and
appliance stores (+5,000). Since reaching an employment
trough in December 2009, retailers have added an average of
14,000 jobs per month.  Employment in leisure and hospitality continued to
trend up in November (+22,000). Within the industry, food
services and drinking places added 33,000 jobs. This gain
more than offset a loss of 12,000 jobs in the accommodation
industry. In the last 12 months, leisure and hospitality
added 253,000 jobs, largely driven by employment increases
in food services and drinking places.  Employment in professional and business services
continued to trend up in November (+33,000). Modest job
gains continued in temporary help services.  Health care employment continued to rise in November
(+17,000). Within the industry, hospitals added 9,000 jobs.
Over the past 12 months, health care has added an average of
27,000 jobs per month.  Manufacturing employment changed little over the month
and has remained essentially unchanged since July. In
November, fabricated metal products added 8,000 jobs, while
electronic instruments lost 2,000 jobs.  Construction employment showed little movement in
November. Employment in the industry has shown little
change, on net, since early 2010.  Government employment continued to trend down in
November, with a decline in the U.S. Postal Service (-
5,000). Employment in both state government and local
government has been trending down since the second half of
2008.  The average workweek for all employees on private
nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.3 hours in November.
The manufacturing workweek was down by 0.2 hour to 40.3
hours, offsetting a 0.2 hour gain in the previous month.
Factory overtime remained at 3.2 hours in November. The
average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees
on private nonfarm payrolls edged down by 0.1 hour to 33.6
hours.  Average hourly earnings for all employees on private
nonfarm payrolls decreased in November by 2 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $23.18. This decline followed a gain of 7 cents
in October. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings
have increased by 1.8 percent. In November, average hourly
earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory
employees increased by 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $19.54.  The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for
September was revised from +158,000 to +210,000, and the
change for October was revised from +80,000 to +100,000.  The Employment Situation for December is scheduled to be
released on Friday, January 6, 2012, at 8:30 a.m. (EST).  Upcoming changes to the Household Survey  In accordance with usual practice, The Employment
Situation release for December 2011, scheduled for January
6, 2012, will incorporate annual revisions in seasonally
adjusted unemployment and other labor force series from the
household survey. Seasonally adjusted data for the most
recent 5 years are subject to revision.  Effective with the release of The Employment Situation
for January 2012, scheduled for February 3, 2012, population
controls that reflect the results of Census 2010 will be
used in the monthly household survey estimation process.
Historical data will not be revised to incorporate the new
controls; consequently, household survey data for January
2012 will not be directly comparable with that for December
2011 or earlier periods. A table showing the effects of the
new controls on the major labor force series will be
included in the January 2012 release.  Also effective with the release of The Employment
Situation for January 2012, the questions on race and
Hispanic or Latino ethnicity in the household survey will be
modified. The minor wording changes in the questions are not
expected to affect the estimates.  In January 2012, the Census Bureau, which conducts the
household survey, will begin a year-long process of
reorganizing its regional office structure. For more
information on these Census Bureau changes, see
www.census.gov/newsroom/pdf/General_QAs_FINAL2.pdf. Both the
Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics will
monitor survey operations during the transition period. No
impact on the employment and unemployment estimates from the
survey is anticipated from this organizational change.  Update to 2012 North American Industry Classification System  With the release of January 2012 data on February 3,
2012, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey will
revise the basis for industry classification from the 2007
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to the
2012 NAICS. The conversion to 2012 NAICS will result in
minor revisions reflecting content changes within the
Construction, Manufacturing, and Retail trade sectors, as
well as minor coding changes within the Utilities and
Leisure and hospitality sectors.  Several industry titles and descriptions also will be
updated. Approximately 1 percent of employment will be
reclassified into different industries as a result of the
revision. Details of new, discontinued, and collapsed
industries due to the 2012 NAICS update, as well as changes
due to the annual benchmarking process, will be available on
January 6, 2012.  For more information on the 2012 NAICS update, visit
