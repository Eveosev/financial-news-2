What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that dry weather
will hinder crop development in parts of South America,
bolstering demand for U.S. supplies,  Don Roose , the president of
U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa, said in a
telephone interview. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.1 cent to 0.15 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures
may open 20 cents to 50 cents higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Corn futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on speculation that demand will improve after an
unexpected drop in the U.S. jobless rate, Roose said. Forecasts
for record production in China will limit gains, he said.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent a bushel lower to 1 cent higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as U.S. winter crops may benefit from a
protective snow cover while excessive rains threaten the harvest
in Australia, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
