Italian and Spanish bonds rose, with
two-year notes headed for a record week, on optimism European
policy makers will agree on measures to pave the way for crisis-
fighting assistance from the  European Central Bank .  Italian bonds advanced for a third day as people familiar
said the ECB may channel bailout loans via the  International
Monetary Fund . Spanish debt climbed for a fifth session after
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said the euro area must
converge economically and German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
the bloc needs a fiscal union. Bonds of  Europe ’s most-indebted
nations also rose as stocks gained and a U.S. report showed the
jobless rate unexpectedly declined last month.  “Sarkozy is moving closer to Merkel and with the ECB
willing to do its part, that’s helping  market sentiment ,” said
Elwin de Groot, an economist at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht,
 Netherlands . “If the euro-zone leaders come up with a strong
commitment then we will go higher with bund yields for sure.”  Italy’s  two-year yield fell 33 basis points to 5.99 percent
at 1:40 p.m. London time. The rate has dropped from 7.66 percent
on Nov. 25, the biggest weekly decline since Bloomberg started
collecting the data in 1993. The 2.25 percent note due in
November 2013 rose 0.55, or 5.50 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,352)
face amount, to 93.515.  Spanish two-year yields dropped 39 basis points, or 0.39
percentage point, to 4.39 percent, having tumbled 170 basis
points this week. Volatility on Spanish debt was the highest in
the euro area today, according to measures of 10-year bonds,
two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  German bunds were little changed with 10-year yields at
2.18 percent.  IMF Assistance  A European proposal to channel central bank loans through
the IMF may deliver as much as 200 billion euros to fight the
sovereign-debt crisis, the two people familiar with the
negotiations said. European finance ministers gave the go-ahead
for work on the plan at a Nov. 29 meeting attended by ECB
President  Mario Draghi , said the people, who declined to be
named because the talks were at an early stage.  European heads of government meet on Dec. 9 in Brussels as
they seek a remedy for the debt crisis that drove yields on
Spanish and Italian debt to euro-era records last month.  Spain ’s
bonds rose yesterday, and French yields fell the most in 20
years, as demand increased at debt auctions and Draghi signaled
the central bank could do more to fight the crisis in return for
closer fiscal union.  Stocks Gain  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index  gained 1.1 percent, heading for
the biggest weekly advance since November 2008. The cost of
insuring against default on European sovereign debt fell, set
for its steepest weekly decline.  The U.S. jobless rate declined to 8.6 percent in November,
the lowest since March 2009, from 9 percent, the Labor
Department said in  Washington . Payrolls climbed 120,000 after a
revised 100,000 increase in October that was larger than
initially estimated.  French  bonds  fell for the first time in six days, with the
10-year yield rising seven basis points to 3.17 percent. The
rate has still fallen 52 basis points this week.  German bonds have returned 7.2 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds gained 2.6 percent
and Italian debt lost 8.4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
