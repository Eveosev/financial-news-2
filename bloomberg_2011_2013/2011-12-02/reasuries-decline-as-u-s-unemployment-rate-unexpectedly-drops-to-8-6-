Treasuries gained amid concern about
the resolve of European officials in their efforts to contain
the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  U.S. 30-year bond  rose  one point as German ChancellorAngela Merkel rejected a plan for joint euro-area bonds or
making the European Central Bank the lender of last resort as
quick fixes of the two-year-old crisis. A European proposal to
channel central-bank loans through the  International Monetary
Fund  may deliver as much as 200 billion euros ($270 billion) to
fight the debt crisis, two people familiar with the negotiations
said. Treasuries fell earlier after a report showed the U.S.
unemployment rate declined to 8.6 percent in November.  “They’re moving at a glacial pace to resolve the
situation” in Europe, said Richard Schlanger, who helps invest
$20 billion in fixed-income securities as vice president at
Pioneer Investments in  Boston . “Eventually, they’re going to
have to ramp up and come out with a more forceful resolution to
calm the markets.”  The benchmark 10-year note  yield  fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.03 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note
due November 2021 rose 15/32, or $4.69 per $1,000 face amount,
to 99 22/32. The yield reached as high as 2.16 percent, the most
since Oct. 31. The yield is up seven basis points in the first
five-day increase in three weeks.  The yield on the 30-year bond dropped seven basis points to
3.02 percent and is up 11 basis points this week.  Fed Buys  The  Federal Reserve  purchased $2.5 billion of securities
due from 2036 to 2041 today as part of a plan announced in
September to replace $400 billion of shorter maturities in its
holdings with longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs. The
central bank also sold $8.63 billion of Treasuries due in 2013.  Treasuries have returned 8.5 percent in 2011, set for the
best annual return since a 14 percent gain in 2008, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data show. Investors bought the U.S.
securities as a haven as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened to
infect the region’s larger economies.  The U.S. 10-year yield traded in a 28-basis-point range
during November, with a high of 2.15 percent and a low of 1.87
percent. That compares with a 70-basis-point range the month
before, with a high of 2.42 percent and a low of 1.72 percent.  Yield Forecast  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
from a net-short position to a net-long position in 10-year note
futures in the week ending Nov. 29, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 17,301 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Last week, traders were net-short 15,291
contracts.  At a Nov. 29 meeting attended by ECB President  Mario Draghi , euro-area finance ministers gave the go-ahead for work
on the plan, said the people, who declined to be named because
the talks are at an early stage. The need for a new crisis-
containment tool emerged as the effort to boost the 440 billion-
euro rescue fund to 1 trillion euros fell short.  “There is a report about Republicans trying to block the
IMF from getting involved in the bailout as the IMF is supported
very heavily by the U.S. That is not comforting, and giving
Treasuries a bid,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in
New York of government and agency debt trading at R.W.
Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and dealer for
institutional investors.  Employment Gains  The two-year swap spread, an indicator of risk in the
financial system, rose two basis points to 45 basis points. The
spread, which equals the difference between two-year swap rates
and comparable maturity Treasury yields,  fell as low as 39  basis
points on Nov. 30 after the Fed, the ECB and four other central
banks agreed to a coordinated reduction in the cost of emergency
dollar funding for the European banks.  Payroll gains in the U.S. picked up last month and the
jobless rate unexpectedly fell to the lowest level since March
2009, a decline augmented by the departure of Americans from the
 labor force .  Payrolls climbed 120,000, after a revised 100,000 increase
in October, with more than half the hiring coming from retailers
and temporary help agencies, Labor Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey called for a 125,000 gain.  Jobs Outlook  The  unemployment rate , derived from a separate survey of
households, was forecast to hold at 9 percent. The decrease in
the jobless rate reflected a 278,000 gain in employment at the
same time 315,000 Americans left the labor force.  “This is not a game changer at all,” said  Ajay Rajadhyaksha , co-head of fixed-income strategy in New York at
Barclays Plc, one of the 21 primary government securities
dealers that traded with the Fed. “The Treasury market would
care if the jobs data was strong enough that it seemed it would
change Fed policy.”  The 10-year yield will rise to 2.20 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of financial companies,
with the most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.
The yield will reach 2.25 percent by the end of March 2012, the
surveys show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
