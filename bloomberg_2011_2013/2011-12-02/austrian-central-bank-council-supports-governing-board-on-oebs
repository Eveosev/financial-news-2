The General Council of
Oesterreichische Nationalbank said it sees no reason to recall
the Austrian central bank’s governing board in connection with a
criminal investigation at its money-printing unit, according to
an e-mailed statement today.  The central bank said on Nov. 28 that the Vienna prosecutor
is investigating the supervisory board at its money-printing
unit Oesterreichische Banknoten- und Sicherheitsdruck GmbH in
connection with its probe into the alleged payment of bribes.  The supervisory board, which said at the that it is
“interested in a complete cleanup of the matter and will fully
cooperate with the investigation,” denied that it had been
informed of the bribes. The supervisory board is headed by
Austrian central bank deputy governor Wolfgang Duchatczek and
also includes governor Ewald Nowotny and fellow board member
Peter Zoellner, according to the company register.  Austrian authorities are investigating the former
management of the money printer on suspicion that the company
paid bribes to get new business and that executives received
kickbacks. The ex-managers have denied any wrongdoing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
