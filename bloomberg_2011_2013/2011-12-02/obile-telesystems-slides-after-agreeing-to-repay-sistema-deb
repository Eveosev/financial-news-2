OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT)  fell the most
in three weeks in New York after agreeing to take on debt of the
telecommunications holding company it bought yesterday almost
equal to the cost of the acquisition.  American depositary receipts of the Russian mobile-phone
provider known as MTS fell 3.8 percent to $16 in New York, the
biggest drop since Nov. 9.  MTS said in a  statement  on its website yesterday that it
had acquired CJSC Sistema-Inventure, which owns 29 percent of
Moscow City Telephone Network, for 10.6 billion rubles ($342
million). The Moscow-based company also agreed to repay 10.4
billion rubles of CJSC Sistema debt owed to  AFK Sistema , CJSC
Sistema’s former owner and the controlling  shareholder  in MTS,
by the end of the year, the statement said.  “While the price of the acquisition seems adequate, MTS
had to take on a debt load equal to the purchase price, and this
is concerning the investors,” said Kirill Bakhtin, an analyst
at Moscow brokerage TKB Capital. “Sistema was faced with this
debt load and through this sale is taking off that debt load and
transferring it to MTS.”  MTS  declined 1.9 percent to close at 209.02 rubles, or the
equivalent of $6.76, on  Russia ’s Micex index. One ADR is equal
to two ordinary shares.  AFK Sistema is Russian billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov ’s
holding company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
