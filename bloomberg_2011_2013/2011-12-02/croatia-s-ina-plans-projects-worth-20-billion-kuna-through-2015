INA Industrija Nafte d.d. (INARA) , Croatia’s
biggest refinery controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , wants to
invest 20 billion kuna ($3.6 billion) in capital projects
through 2015, subject to securing financing.  Two-thirds of the planned investment projects will be in
Croatia, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  INA will keep reserves at the current level and maintain
production at a level of at least 70,000 barrels per day by
developing existing assets. It also expects a return of more
than 10 percent of the invested capital in its retail network,
which is currently being overhauled, it said.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
