GKN Plc (GKN) , the U.K. maker of aircraft
components for Airbus SAS, fell the most in three months on
concern an explosion and other incidents at a U.S. plant will
result in liabilities and charges.  GKN fell as much as 10.8 pence, or 5.2 percent, to 197.7
pence in London trading, the biggest drop since March 15,
valuing the company at 3.1 billion pounds ($5 billion).  Four people died and several got injured in a series of
separate incidents, including a fire, at GKN’s iron-powder plant
in Gallatin,  Tennessee  this year.  “There will be direct financial impacts from the resulting
temporary plant closure such that the company may take a
charge” in the second quarter, said Jason Adams, an analyst at
Nomura International, with a “reduce” rating on GKN. “But the
markets are more concerned about the tail risk of the total
potential financial liabilities related to these incidents and
that may be difficult for the company to quantify in the near
term.”  GKN spokesman Guy Stainer was not available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
