Spain  sold 2.84 billion euros ($4
billion) of bonds, missing the Treasury’s maximum target, and
its borrowing costs rose as  Greece ’s political crisis boosted
expectations of the euro region’s first sovereign default.  The Treasury in Madrid said it sold 1.51 billion euros of
15-year bonds at an average yield of 6.027 percent. That
compares with 6.068 percent on the secondary market before the
sale and 5.953 percent when similar maturity bonds were sold on
Dec. 16. Spain also sold 1.33 billion euros of eight-year debt
at an average yield of 5.352 percent.  Demand for the 15-year debt was 2.57 times the amount sold,
compared with 2.52 times at the December auction. The bid-to-
cover ratio for the eight-year securities was 2.13. The Treasury
aimed to sell a maximum of 3.5 billion euros in total.  Spain sold debt as its 10-year borrowing costs surged to
the highest since Ireland requested a European Union bailout in
November and the cost of insuring Greek debt against default
rose to a record. Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said
yesterday he’d call a confidence vote to try to get allies to
back a new package of austerity measures demanded in return for
a new EU-led rescue 13 months after the 110 billion-euro bailout
that failed to stem the region’s debt crisis.  Risk Premium  The yield on Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond rose after the
sale to 5.65 percent, widening the gap between Spanish and
German borrowing costs to 271 basis points compared with 266
basis points before the sale. That’s down from a euro-era record
of 298 basis points on Nov. 30. That spread averaged 15 basis
points in the first decade of monetary union.  Papandreou’s decision came after EU talks on forming a new
Greek bailout to prevent the first euro-area default stalled.
The impasse over the aid formula and speculation that a
government shakeup would disrupt passage of budget cuts and
asset sales sent Greek bond yields to euro-era highs and knocked
the euro down by more than 2 percent against the dollar in the
past two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
