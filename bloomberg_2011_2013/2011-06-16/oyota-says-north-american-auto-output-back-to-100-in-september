Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , slowed by tight
parts supplies since Japan’s record earthquake in March, said
vehicle production at its plants in North America is recovering
faster than planned and will return to normal in September.  Camry, Avalon and Corolla car, Venza wagon, Sienna minivan
and Highlander and Sequoia sport-utility vehicle output returned
to full production on June 6, and assembly of Tundra and Tacoma
pickup trucks and RAV4 and Lexus RX SUVs will be fully restored
by September, Bob Carter, group vice president of U.S. sales,
said in an interview today.  Toyota’s U.S. sales unit is based in Torrance, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
