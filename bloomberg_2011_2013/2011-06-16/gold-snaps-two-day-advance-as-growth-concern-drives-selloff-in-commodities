Gold gained in  New York  as central
bank buying may support demand.  Central banks will be net buyers of gold this year and
probably next year, World Gold Council Managing Director Marcus
Grubb said at a conference in  London  today. They have already
bought 129 metric tons this year through April, exceeding last
year’s total of 90 tons, he said.  “I wouldn’t be surprised if this is contributing to the
slight price  move up today,” said Mark O’Byrne, executive
director of Goldcore Ltd. in Dublin. “This could be the
beginnings of the eurozone central banks buying gold as a
monetary asset in order to protect the euro,” he wrote in a
report on Goldcore’s website today.  Gold for August delivery rose $4.30, or 0.3 percent, to
$1,530.50 an ounce by 9:03 a.m. an ounce on the Comex in New
York. Gold for immediate delivery was little changed at
$1,529.30 an ounce.  The euro fell for a second day against the dollar as
speculation the Greek debt crisis is deteriorating damped demand
for the region’s assets. Gold traded at a record in British
pounds.  Greece ’s Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said he will
reshuffle his cabinet and seek a confidence vote. He sought to
reassert his authority in a televised address last night hours
after police used tear gas to break up protests in central
 Athens  and media reported he was in talks to step down in favor
of a unity government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
