Sri Lanka  was on 23-1 in its first
innings when rain halted play in the third cricket Test with
England at Southampton.  James Anderson took the wicket of Lahiru Thirimanne, who
was caught on 10 by  Andrew Strauss  two balls before play was
halted. Tharanga Paranavitana, on 11, and Kumar Sangakkara, on
0, were batting when lunch was taken early.  The start of play was delayed for an hour by rain this
morning, and England won the toss and put the visitors in to
bat.  England leads the three-Test series 1-0, after winning the
first match in Cardiff. The second Test, at Lordâ€™s in London,
was drawn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
