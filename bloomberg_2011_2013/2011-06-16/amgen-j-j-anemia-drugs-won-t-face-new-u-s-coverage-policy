Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  and  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) 
won’t face new reimbursement limits for their anemia medicines
after U.S. regulators decided against issuing a national
coverage policy.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed in
March to maintain current standards for using Amgen’s Aranesp
and Epogen and J&J’s Procrit, leaving coverage determination to
regional Medicare contractors that process reimbursement claims.
The agency made the proposal final today.  “Given the totality of the currently available evidence,
CMS will not issue a national coverage determination at this
time,” the agency said on its website.  The decision removes an “overhang” on shares of Thousand
Oaks, California-based Amgen, said Michael Yee, an analyst with
RBC Capital Markets, in a research note last week. Maintaining
the coverage policy won’t affect revenue at the company, the
world’s largest biotechnology firm, he said.  “There simply, and rationally, isn’t enough info at this
time to change current treatment guidelines,” Yee, based in  San
Francisco , wrote in a June 9 note to clients.  J&J, the world’s second-biggest seller of health-care
products after New York-based Pfizer Inc., is based in  New
Brunswick , New Jersey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
