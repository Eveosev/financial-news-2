Amer Group Holding (AMER)  headed for the
highest close in more than two months after first-quarter profit
was little changed from the fourth quarter before popular unrest
overthrew the Egyptian government.  Shares of the Cairo-based real-estate and resorts developer
gained as much as 4.3 percent before trading 2.9 percent higher
at 1.43 Egyptian pounds, heading for the highest close since
April 3. The benchmark EGX 30 Index fell 0.5 percent at 12 p.m.
in Cairo.  Amer said profit for the three months ended March 31 was
133.9 million Egyptian pounds ($22.5 million). The company had a
profit of 135.3 million pounds in the fourth-quarter of 2010,
according to Bloomberg data.  Egypt ’s anti-government protests
started on Jan. 25, forcing tourists to leave, the country’s
financial markets to close and halting construction and
manufacturing.  The company didn’t provide a comparative figure for the
first-quarter of 2010 because it said it didn’t have audited
results for that period. Amer offered its shares to the public
for the first time last November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
