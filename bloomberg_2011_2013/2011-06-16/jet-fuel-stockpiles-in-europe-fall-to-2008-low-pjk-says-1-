Jet fuel stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, fell to the lowest since August 2008, according to PJK
International BV.  Jet fuel inventories declined 16 percent to 419,000 metric
tons in the week to today, according to PJK, a researcher based
in the Netherlands. That’s the lowest level since Aug. 21, 2008,
when stockpiles were at 393,000 tons, said Pieter Kulsen,
founder of PJK.  “There are no problems with availability so there is no
incentive to store product,” Kulsen said by phone from
Oosterhout, where the company is based. An increase in demand
during the holiday season means the aviation industry has
incentive to use the oil straight away, he said.  Gasoil inventories decreased 3.4 percent to 2.82 million
tons as the fuel was sent to  Brazil  and West Africa, according
to PJK data. Supplies of the fuel, which include heating oil and
diesel, arrived from  Russia .  Fuel oil dropped 11 percent to 846,000 tons as product was
taken out of storage to load vessels to  Singapore . Supplies
arrived from France, Poland, Russia and the U.K.  Gasoline stockpiles rose 4.6 percent to 612,000 tons, the
highest level since May 19, according to PJK. The motor fuel
arrived from Denmark, France, Russia and the U.K., while cargoes
were sent to Canada, Mexico, Nigeria and the U.S.  Naphtha stores more than doubled to 87,000 tons to the
highest level in two weeks as cargoes arrived from Russia, PJK
data showed.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
