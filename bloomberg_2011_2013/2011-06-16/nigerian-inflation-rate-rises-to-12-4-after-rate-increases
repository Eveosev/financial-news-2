Nigeria ’s inflation accelerated to
12.4 percent in May as three consecutive interest rate increases
failed to bring it into line with the central bank’s 10 percent
target.  The inflation rate climbed from 11.3 percent the month
before, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said today in a
statement in the capital, Abuja.  The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by half
a percentage point to 8 percent on May 24 and doubled the
reserve requirement for banks as it tried to stabilize the naira
and counter the impact on prices of increased  government
spending .  Central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said on May 24 that
monetary policy will have “to bear the burden of adjustment
through further tightening in order to rein in inflation.”  Nigeria’s economy, the third-biggest on the continent after
 South Africa  and Egypt, grew 7.4 percent in the first quarter,
according to the statistics office. The economy is projected to
grow 8 percent this year, compared with 7.8 percent in 2010, the
institute says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
