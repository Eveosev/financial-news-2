Indonesia’s rupiah fell to a three-
week low as the deepening debt crisis in Greece heightened  risk
aversion , damping demand for emerging-market assets.  Government
bonds  dropped.  The currency declined the most in five weeks as the MSCI
Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares slumped 2.1 percent. Greek
Prime Minister George Papandreou will reshuffle his Cabinet and
hold a confidence vote today after failing to gather support
from the opposition for austerity measures.  “There’s some risk aversion because of uncertainties about
the Europe debt crisis,” said Eric Alexander Sugandi, a
Jakarta-based economist at Standard Chartered Plc. “I expect
the weakness in the rupiah to be temporary because the country’s
fundamentals are still strong.”  The rupiah declined 0.7 percent to 8,606 per dollar as of
4:26 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the weakest level since May 26.  The currency has gained 4.3 percent this year, the second-
best performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies after
the  Taiwan dollar , as global funds boosted holdings of
government bonds by 21 percent to 236.56 trillion rupiah ($27.5
billion) through June 14, according to data from the debt
management office.  The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 climbed 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 7.51 percent,
according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
