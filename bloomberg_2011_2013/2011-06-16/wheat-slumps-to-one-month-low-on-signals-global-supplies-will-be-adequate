Wheat futures fell to a three-month
low on speculation that global supplies will be ample as  Russia 
resumes exports next month, while rains improve crop prospects
in Ukraine.  Russia, once the world’s second-largest shipper, plans to
remove a ban on exports July 1. Ukraine’s Hydrometeorology
Center said weekend rains across most of the country improved
the harvest outlook. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  on June
9 raised its estimate for global inventories to 184.26 million
metric tons, up 1.7 percent from a month earlier.  “You’ve got the prospects of a big Russian crop, with them
back out exporting again,” said  Tomm Pfitzenmaier , a partner at
Summit Commodity Brokerage in  Des Moines , Iowa. “The whole
thing looks pretty negative.”  Wheat futures for September delivery plunged 31 cents, or
4.2 percent, to settle at $7.0825 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, after touching $7.0325, the lowest for a
most-active contract since March 17.  While the commodity has slumped 9.5 percent this month,
prices are up 49 percent from a year ago, after a drought in
Russia last year and a dry spell that threatened crops in the
U.S. Great Plains and  Europe  in 2011. The U.S. is the leading
exporter.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
