Hungary’s 10-year bonds extended
their slump, lifting the yield the most this year.  The yield on the notes maturing in June 2022 rose 23 basis
points, or 0.23 percentage point, to 7.351 percent. That’s the
biggest increase since the securities started trading in January
and the highest yield since March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
