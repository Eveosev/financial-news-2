The number of condominiums offered
for sale in greater  Tokyo  area rose less-than-expected in May as
some developers delayed plans to sell following the March
earthquake, said  the Real Estate Economic Research Institute .  A total of 3,914 units went on sale last month, 3.6 percent
higher from a year earlier, according to a report by the Tokyo-
based institute. That compares with 5,500 units that were
predicted to be sold last month, it said. A total of 5,500 units
are expected to be sold in June, the report said.  Developers held back sales on concerns that demand will
decline after a magnitude-9 earthquake and ensuing tsunami on
March 11 crippled a nuclear plant in Fukushima Prefecture, about
220 kilometers (135 miles) north of Tokyo.  Consumer confidence 
remained near a two-year low in May, a government report showed
following the catastrophe that left more than 23,000 people dead
or missing.  “Some developers have delayed their sales plans as they
had to close their model rooms following the disaster,” said
Akio Fukuda, a manager, at the institute. “That trend may be
changing, but we need to see how things go next month to make
any definite calls.”  The  Topix Real Estate Index (TPREAL) , measuring 44 property-related
stocks, accelerated declines following the report, falling 2.5
percent as of 2:08 p.m. in Tokyo, compared with the 1.3 percent
in the benchmark index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
