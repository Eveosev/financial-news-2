Russian producer prices, an early
indicator of inflation, rose in May faster than economists
predicted, led by the mining sector and manufacturers.  Prices of goods leaving factories and mines jumped an
annual 19.2 percent, growing for a 19th consecutive month, after
a 20.2 percent advance a month earlier, the  Federal Statistics
Service  in Moscow said in an e-mailed statement today. The
median forecast of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for
an increase of 19 percent.  Factory-gate prices climbed 1.2 percent in May from the
previous month after a 2 percent monthly rise in April, the
service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
