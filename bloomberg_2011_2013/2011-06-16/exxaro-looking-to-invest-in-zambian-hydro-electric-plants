partnerships with Zambian companies, Kazunga said in an
interview at a mining conference in the capital, Lusaka,
yesterday, without giving details of how much they may invest.  “We are bullish right now and we are looking for
opportunities to invest in clean hydro-energy in Zambia,” he
said. “We also want to explore opportunities of selling the
energy we generate in Zambia to South Africa.”  Zambia, Africa’s top copper producer, is targeting output
of 2 million metric tons by 2015, Finance and Planning Minister
