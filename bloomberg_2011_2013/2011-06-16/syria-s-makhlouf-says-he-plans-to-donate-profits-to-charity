Syrian businessman Rami Makhlouf, a
cousin of President Bashar Al-Assad, said he plans to donate
profits from his investments to charity and will no longer be a
“burden” on the country.  “I announce that I will not allow myself to be a burden on
 Syria , its people and president from now on,” Makhlouf said in
a press conference in the capital, Damascus, yesterday.  Makhlouf, who holds stakes in businesses including Syriatel
Mobile Telecom SA, was one of 13 Syrian officials subject to
European Union sanctions last month. In 2008, the U.S. Treasury
Department sanctioned Syriatel for its connection to the
businessman and, in a statement, accused Makhlouf of using
access to “high-level” officials to enrich himself.  A total of 1,289 civilians and 332 security forces have
been killed in Syria since protests broke out in the country
three months ago, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said
on June 12. The uprising, which has prompted as many at 10,000
Syrians to flee to  Turkey , threatens to undermine the Assad
family’s 40-year rule of the Middle Eastern country.  Makhlouf linked  Israel ’s stability to Syria’s in an
interview with the New York Times, the newspaper reported May
10. Syria’s ruling elite will fight to the end, he told the
newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
