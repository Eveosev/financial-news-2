Ukrainian grains were in improved
condition after weekend rains across most of the country
bolstered the harvest outlook, according to the national
Hydrometeorology Center.  “Luxurious and favored rains” covered most of the
country, with some areas receiving a month of rainfall in days,
Tetiana Adamenko, head of the center’s agricultural department,
said by telephone today. Prospects for the harvest are much more
favorable than a week ago, she said.  Ukraine has removed quotas on exports of wheat, barley and
corn imposed last year after drought reduced the grain crop by 6
million metric tons. Outbound shipments are to be taxed from
next month through December.  Air and soil moisture has improved, helping to boost yields
from plant heads, according to the center. Conditions are very
good for corn, Adamenko said, calling current temperatures of 25
degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) to 27 degrees “super”
for the grain.  Spring barley, the crop that was most hurt by heat and dry
weather in May and June, will have no further losses after
humidity improved, according to the meteorologist. Spring barley
yields probably will be 5 percent to 15 percent below average
this year, she said.  Weather conditions are very good for wheat quality,
Adamenko said, adding that more than half of Ukraine’s crop will
be suitable for milling.  There are no signs temperatures may rebound before the end
of the month, and the weather may turn cooler around June 20,
Adamenko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
