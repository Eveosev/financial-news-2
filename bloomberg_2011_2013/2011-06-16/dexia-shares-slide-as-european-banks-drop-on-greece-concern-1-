Dexia SA (DEXB) , the bank that took the
most Federal Reserve discount-window help in October 2008, fell
as much as 10 percent in Brussels trading on concern that Greek
political turmoil will worsen  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The shares fell as low as 2.23 euros, and traded at 2.16
euros, down 4.3 percent, at 10:17 a.m. local time. Dexia led
declines today among European banking stocks.  Moody’s Investors Service yesterday placed France’s biggest
banks on review for a possible rating downgrade and said
“exposures to  Greece ” are to be included within the
“ongoing” review opened by Moody’s on March 28 for possible
downgrade of Dexia’s core operating banks. Brussels-based Dexia
has 5.4 billion euros ($7.6 billion) outstanding in Greece,
according to CreditSights.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will reshuffle his
cabinet today and seek a confidence vote as he strives to
control a shrinking majority and pass austerity measures
demanded by international lenders.  “We see the direct impact of a Greek restructuring as
manageable for Dexia,” Tom van Kempen, an analyst at ING Groep
NV in Amsterdam, wrote in a note today. “We are however more
worried about contagion effects as the Belgian lender’s exposure
to Portugal is also rather important. A potential downgrade will
have a clear negative impact on the company’s funding costs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
