Canadian stocks fell, completing a
third-straight weekly decline, after  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  cut
its earnings forecasts and oil futures dropped to the lowest
level in almost four months.  RIM, the BlackBerry maker, plunged 22 percent.  Royal Bank
of Canada (RY) ,  Canada ’s biggest lender by assets, increased 1.2
percent after people familiar with the situation said it is in
advanced talks to sell its U.S. retail unit to PNC Financial
Services Group Inc.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s biggest oil and
gas producer, declined 0.9 percent as oil slumped after the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its estimate of U.S. growth.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 63.18
points, or 0.5 percent, to a seven-month low of 12,789.95,
extending its weekly retreat to 2.3 percent.  “The U.S. has slowed down dramatically,” said Blair Falconer, a  money manager  who oversees about C$800 million ($816
million) for HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc. in Toronto. “It
looks like we’re going to have an extended slow-growth period.”  The S&P/TSX sank 6.9 percent this month through yesterday
as the risk of a default on Greek government debt climbed and
data on employment and manufacturing trailed economists’
forecasts. The stock benchmark has tumbled 10 percent since
April 5, meeting the common definition of a correction.  RIM sank 22 percent, the most since September 2008, to
C$27.24. The company forecast 2012 earnings of $5.25 a share to
$6 a share, excluding certain items, after estimating $7.50 a
share in April. At least five analysts cut their ratings on the
stock.  Electronics Maker  Celestica Inc. (CLS) , which makes electronics for companies
including RIM, slumped 7.5 percent, the most in two years, to
C$7.91. Jim Suva, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., lowered his
rating on Celestica to “sell” from “hold,” citing RIM’s
outlook in a note to clients.  Royal Bank rallied 1.2 percent to C$54.33 after people who
spoke on condition of anonymity said PNC is likely to prevail
over a rival bid from BB&T Corp. The business may fetch as much
as $3.7 billion,  Peter Routledge , an analyst at National Bank
Financial, said in April.  The S&P/TSX Energy Index fell to a six-month low as oil
futures extended their weekly drop to 6.3 percent. Suncor
declined 0.9 percent to C$37.17.  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , Canada’s
fifth-largest energy company, lost 1.5 percent to C$32.65.  Magna International Inc. (MG) , Canada’s biggest auto-parts
maker, rose 5.1 percent to C$47.47 for a fifth-straight gain as
lower fuel prices boosted world transportation-equipment stocks.  Fertilizer producers dropped for a second day a day after
the  U.S. Senate  voted to eliminate a tax credit for ethanol.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, decreased 2.8 percent to
C$49.55.  Agrium Inc. (AGU)  lost 2.6 percent to C$78.01.  Share Split  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-biggest
publicly traded copper producer, advanced 3.2 percent to
C$119.01 after saying it split its shares five-to-one effective
Aug 9, pending shareholder approval.  Bridgewater Systems Corp. (BWC) , which makes software for
wireless carriers, soared 28 percent, the most in three years,
to C$8.10 after agreeing to be bought by Amdocs Ltd. for C$8.20.  Mosaid Technologies Inc. (MSD) , a semiconductor developer, sank
14 percent, the most since 2005, to C$26.97 after forecasting
2012 earnings below analysts’ estimates. Brian J. Piccioni, an
analyst at  Bank of Montreal (BMO) , and Sean Peasgood, an analyst at
Wellington West Capital Inc., cut their ratings on the shares to
“market perform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
