Zimbabwe ’s inflation rate fell to
2.5 percent in May from 2.7 percent a month earlier, said Moffat Nyoni, director of the country’s statistics agency.  Prices in the month increased 0.1 percent, he said by phone
from Harare, the capital, today.  An IMF  report  released in  Washington  on June 14 said
Zimbabwe may miss its 4 percent inflation target this year
because of high fuel costs and rising wages.  “Twelve-month inflation is forecast to reach about 7
percent by December 2011 on account of higher food and fuel
prices as well as wage-driven increases in prices for non-
tradeables, for example rents and services,” the IMF said in
the e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
