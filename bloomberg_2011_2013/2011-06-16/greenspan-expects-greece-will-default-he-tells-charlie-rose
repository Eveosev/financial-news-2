Alan Greenspan , former U.S. Federal
Reserve chairman, said the probability of a default by Greece is
“so high that you almost have to say there’s no way out” and
some U.S. banks may be left “up against the wall.”  “The chances of Greece not defaulting are very small,”
Greenspan, 85, said in an interview today with  Charlie Rose  in
New York. “The problem you have is that it’s extremely unlikely
the political system will work in such a manner as to create” a
solution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
