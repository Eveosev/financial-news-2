California Governor  Jerry Brown  said
he hopes to persuade Republican lawmakers to support his tax-
extension plan after vetoing a budget the Democrat-controlled
Legislature sent to him yesterday that lacked the proposal.  “I’m going to talk to each of those Republicans for the
10th time, for the 15th time,” Brown said today at a news
conference at his office in  Los Angeles .  To contact the reporter on this story:
