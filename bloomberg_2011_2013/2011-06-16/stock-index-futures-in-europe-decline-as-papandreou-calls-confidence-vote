European stocks fell to a three-
month low as Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said he will
reshuffle his cabinet and seek a confidence vote.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  led basic-resource shares lower as
metal prices fell.  Lenzing AG (LNZ)  dropped 2.7 percent as the
Austrian maker of textile fibers and its majority shareholder
B&C Industrieholding GmbH sold about 619 million euros ($877
million) of shares.  Carrefour SA (CA)  tumbled 3.5 percent as UBS AG
recommended selling shares of the French retailer.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.5 percent to
266.73 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , its lowest level since
March, as all but three industry groups slid. The gauge has lost
8.4 percent since this year’s high on Feb. 17 as a slowdown in
U.S. job creation suggested the economic recovery is faltering
and speculation grew that  Greece  will default on its debt.  “The situation is very terrible at the moment because
there are so many stories about the debt crisis out there and
nobody knows what the solution is,” said  Markus Wallner , a
senior equity strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “The
equity market will only turn around when we finally agree on a
solution. Economic data showing no sign that the U.S. is in
recovery mode are not helping either.”  Papandreou Address  Papandreou sought to reassert his authority in a televised
address last night hours after police used tear gas to break up
protests in central  Athens . Thousands remained outside
Parliament late into the evening, with police estimating the
crowd at 8,000 people at 10:20 p.m. local time.  European Union talks to forge a new bailout to prevent the
first euro-area default stalled. The impasse over the aid
formula and speculation that a government shakeup would disrupt
the passage of budget cuts and asset sales sent Greek bonds and
the euro plunging yesterday.  The  International Monetary Fund  today said it is ready to
continue supporting Greece if the economic measures agreed upon
as part of a bailout package with the European Union are
adopted.  European stocks maintained declines today even after
reports showed that housing starts in the U.S. increased more
than forecast in May and fewer Americans than predicted filed
applications for  unemployment benefits  last week.  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 18 western
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX Index slipped 0.1 percent, the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index lost 0.8 percent and France’s CAC 40 Index
retreated 0.4 percent.  Vedanta Resources, Antofagasta  Vedanta Resources lost 2.4 percent to 1,935 pence,  Anglo
American Plc (AAL)  declined 1.8 percent to 2,811 pence, while
 Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  dropped 2 percent to 1,215 pence. Aluminum,
copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc all fell on the London Metal
Exchange.  Lenzing dropped 2.7 percent to 89.49 euros after the
company sold 825,000 new shares generating gross proceeds of 76
million euros. The shares were sold at 92 euros apiece, the
bottom end of a 92-euro-to-108-euro range set on May 29, and
will will start trading in Vienna on June 17.  Societe Generale SA lost 1.7 percent to 38.14 euros, while
Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl retreated 2.8 percent to 1.57
euros and Dexia SA, the lender to local governments that was
rescued by France and Belgium in 2008, fell 3.2 percent to 2.19
euros, its lowest price in more than two years. Brussels-based
Dexia has 5.4 billion euros outstanding in Greece, according to
CreditSights.  The ECB said yesterday that the threat of the Greek debt
crisis spilling over into the banking sector is the biggest risk
to the region’s financial stability.  Greek Banks  Alpha Bank SA, Greece’s third-biggest lender, dropped 4.3
percent to 3.12 euros, while National Bank of Greece SA, the
country’s largest lender, declined 4.2 percent to 4.38 euros.
 EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  lost 3.3 percent to 2.90 euros.  Alcatel-Lucent SA, France’s largest telecommunications
equipment maker, led technology stocks lower, falling 1.5
percent to 3.63 euros. U.S.-based  Finisar Corp. (FNSR) , a maker of
fiber-optic transmission gear, reported fourth-quarter revenue
of $236.95 million, missing the average analyst estimate of $243
million.  Carrefour tumbled 3.5 percent to 27.75 euros as UBS
downgraded the world’s second-largest retailer to “sell” from
“neutral.”  Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) , a French operator of
hypermarkets and supermarkets, fell 3.3 percent to 66.77 euros
as it was cut to “equal weight” from “overweight” at Morgan
Stanley.  U.K. Retail Sales  A report today showed U.K. retail sales dropped more than
economists forecast in May. Sales fell 1.4 percent from April,
when they rose 1.1 percent, boosted by warm weather and an extra
public holiday, the Office for National Statistics said in
London.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  fell 1.7 percent to 397.4 pence, while Next
Plc retreated 1.6 percent to 2,196 pence.  Demag Cranes AG gained 2.3 percent to 45.30 euros, the
first advance this week, after Terex Corp. agreed to buy the
German company. Terex first raised its offer price for Demag to
45.50 euros a share from an earlier 41.75 euros a share. The
price is 25 percent higher than Demag’s close on April 29, the
last day of trading before the Westport, Connecticut-based
company’s first proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
