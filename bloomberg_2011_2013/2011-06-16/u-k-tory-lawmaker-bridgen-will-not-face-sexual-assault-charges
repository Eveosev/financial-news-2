Andrew Bridgen , a member of the
House of Commons from Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
 Conservative Party , won’t face charges after he was arrested on
suspicion of sexual assault, London’s Metropolitan Police said.  The 46-year-old lawmaker, who was elected last year, was
arrested in the early hours of June 9 on suspicion of an offense
against a 29-year-old woman at an address in central London. He
was later released on bail and cleared by a police
investigation.  “A 46-year-old man arrested on June 9 was today released
from bail with no further action following a police inquiry,” a
spokesman for the police said by telephone today when asked
about Bridgen. The spokesman didn’t give his name, in line with
police policy.  “From the outset, I said the allegation was without
foundation, demonstrably and provably false, and I was wholly
confident that the outcome of the police investigation would see
me exonerated,” Bridgen said in a statement on his  website . “I
remain hurt and angry that such a ludicrous, false
and unsubstantiated allegation should have been given the
attention it has.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
