Europe ’s leveraged buyout debt
market faces “material refinancing challenges” through 2015 as
181 billion euros ($255 billion) of unrated loans and bonds come
due, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report.  The amount in need of refinancing has declined by 40
billion euros since Moody’s published a similar study in May
last year, according to the  report . Debt “primarily” maturing
in 2013 and 2014 was refinanced largely through high-yield
bonds, Moody’s said. Smaller companies have also pushed out
their maturities to 2016 or later by amending and extending
existing bank loans, according to the report.  Moody’s said that the move of issuance to the high yield
bond market from leveraged loans was “structural,” and
predicted that 2011 will be another record year for European
high-yield issuance.  More than $51.5 billion of high-yield bonds have been
issued in Europe year to date, already close to the record $66.3
billion issued in all of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
