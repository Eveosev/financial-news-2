Olympic Group Financial Investments (OLGR) ,
an Egyptian appliances manufacturer, said  Electrolux AB (ELUXB)  has
extended its due diligence into the company by 15 days, the
third such delay following political unrest in  Egypt .  The Cairo-based company did not give a reason for the
extension. Electrolux, the world’s second-largest appliance
maker, had suspended the acquisition for more than a month on
Feb. 2 after the start of anti-government demonstrations in the
Arab country.  “It’s not a surprise in light of the events in Egypt,”
said Ahmed Khalil, an analyst at Cairo-based investment bank
Beltone Financial Holding SAE. “Electrolux is being extra
careful considering the increased political risk.”  Stockholm-based Electrolux agreed last October to purchase
52 percent of Olympic from Paradise Capital in a transaction
valued at $246 million, part of its bid to acquire up to 100
percent of the company.  Olympic Group shares rose 0.5 percent to 35.99 Egyptian
pounds at 1:50 p.m. in Cairo, valuing the company at 2.16
billion pounds ($363 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
