Sri Lanka  collapsed to 29-3 at tea
of the first day of the third cricket Test with  England  in
Southampton.  The visitors lost two wickets and gained 6 runs in the five
overs after lunch, which was taken early because of rain.
 James Anderson  returned to England’s squad and took the wickets
of Lahiru Thirimanne, who was caught on 10, and Kumar
Sangakkara, who was caught on 2. Tharanga Paranavitana was out
leg-before-wicket on 11.  The start of play was delayed for an hour by rain this
morning, and England won the toss and put the visitors in to
bat.  England leads the three-Test series 1-0, after winning the
first match in Cardiff. The second Test, at Lord’s in  London ,
was drawn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
