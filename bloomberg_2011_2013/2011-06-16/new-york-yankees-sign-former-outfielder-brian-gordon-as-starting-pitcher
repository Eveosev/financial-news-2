Brian Gordon was signed as a
starting pitcher by the  New York Yankees , four years after
switching positions from outfielder.  Gordon, who had an opt-out clause in his contract with the
 Philadelphia Phillies , was released yesterday and signed with
the Yankees, New York said on its website last night.  Manager Joe Girardi named Gordon to start today’s
Major League Baseball home game against the  Texas Rangers .
Girardi said before last night’s 12-4 win over the Rangers that
either Gordon or Hector Noesi would get the call.  Gordon was 5-0 with a  1.14 earned run average  this season
in 12 games, including nine starts, for the Lehigh Valley
IronPigs, the Phillies’ Triple-A affiliate. His only major
league experience came with the Rangers in 2008. In four relief
appearances, he gave up one run on four hits in four innings.  The 32-year-old right-hander from West Point,  New York ,
left the outfield following the 2006 season. He signed with the
Phillies in January 2010.  The Yankees also signed Cory Wade to a major league
contract yesterday, two days after signing the right-hander to a
minor league deal.  Reliever Kevin Whelan was optioned to Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to make room for Wade on the major league
roster, and Rafael Soriano was transferred to the 60-day
disabled list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
