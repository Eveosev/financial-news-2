European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said financial markets have made
“certain misreadings” on EU leaders’ intentions in the Greek
debt crisis.  “There is a certain misreading of the intentions and
future actions of the European leaders,” Rehn said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview in Brussels. “We will not let
the euro area face any kind of catastrophe.”  “We have always been concerned of contagion,” Rehn said.
“One of the achievements over the past one-and-a-half years has
been that we have been able to prevent a financial meltdown in
 Europe . We have been able to avoid a Lehman Brothers kind of
catastrophe on the European soil. And moreover, we have been
able to contain the crisis to the three countries now under the
program,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
