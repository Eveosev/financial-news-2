The Kenya shilling weakened to the
lowest level in 17 years as demand for the dollar rose amid
speculation companies will need to pay for more imported fuel.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy declined as
much as 2.9 percent to the lowest level since March 1994, and
traded 1.6 percent weaker at 89.80 per dollar at 3:52 p.m. in
the capital, Nairobi.  “The weakening of the shilling is due to a demand and
supply mismatch with speculation of an increase in imports of
fuel for thermal generation,” Chris Muiga, a senior dealer at
Nairobi based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  Rain between March and May, the nation’s long wet season,
was “highly depressed” in most parts of the country, curbing
hydropower output and damaging crops, the Kenya Meteorological
Department said on May 26. Kenya Electricity Generating Co., the
largest power producer in the country, boosted output from its
oil-fired plants because of the weather, Mike Njeru, corporate
affairs manager at the company, said in an e-mailed response to
questions on June 14.  “We are keeping our hydro generation below maximum while
increasing thermal generation,” Njeru said.  Policy makers received bids worth 2 billion shillings ($22
million) and rejected all of the bids for the 1 billion
shillings worth of  repurchase agreements  it offered, according
to central bank data on Bloomberg.  In a repurchase agreement an investor agrees to sell a
security to another trader, while at the same time arranging to
buy it back at a future date and at a pre-determined price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
