North America  will become the
fastest growing oil-producing region outside OPEC during the
next five years, with output estimated to jump 11 percent,
according to the  International Energy Agency .  The region is likely to see output climb 1.5 million
barrels a day to 15.6 million by 2016 mostly because of
increased output from Canadian oil sands and U.S. onshore shale
formations, the Paris-based adviser to oil-consuming nations
said today in its Medium-Term Oil and Gas Markets report.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Canadian unit is investing C$10 billion
($10.2 billion) on the Kearl oil sands project in  Canada , and
companies including  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG) ,  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) 
and  SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD)  have committed about $1 billion each
in the past two years to produce oil from U.S. geological
formations such as the Bakken Shale in  North Dakota .  “North America is now seen as the strongest-growing non-
OPEC region,” the report said, citing “upward revisions to
U.S. onshore crude from tight oil formations” and higher
projections from Canadian natural gas liquids and oil sands.  Total production from Canada was forecast to rise by 1.3
million barrels a day to 4.7 million.  In the IEA’s last medium-term outlook in December, the
largest downward revision to production outside the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries came from the Canadian oil
sands. The Dec. 10 report cut almost 400,000 barrels a day from
previously forecast output saying “a degree of slippage is
evident.” Today’s report says projections “are seen higher.”  U.S. Production  The IEA also said U.S. production is forecast to grow a
“healthy” 500,000 barrels a day to 8.3 million barrels a day
by 2016. U.S. production of “light tight” oil, also known as
shale oil, is likely to grow by 1 million barrels a day to 1.36
million by 2016 from estimated output of 370,000 barrels a day
in 2010, the report said.  U.S. shale formations such as the Bakken, Eagle Ford in
Texas and Marcellus in  Pennsylvania  require a mix of horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing to produce oil and natural gas
from dense rock formations.  Rising output from shale formations may trim U.S. imports
of low-sulfur crude oil by 500,000 barrels a day within five
years as new pipelines carry the oil to refineries along the
 Gulf of Mexico , according to a study released yesterday by
analysts at Purvin & Gertz Inc.  Shale production should rise to about 900,000 barrels a day
by 2015 and to more than 1.3 million barrels a day by 2020,
displacing imports, Geoff Houlton, a vice president at the
Houston-based energy company, said yesterday in an interview.  The IEA also said Mexican production would be slightly
higher than previously forecast, though it’s still estimated to
decline by 400,000 barrels a day to 2.6 million by 2016 because
“ Mexico  so far lacks substantial new projects in the pipeline
to boost production.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
