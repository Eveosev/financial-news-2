Turkey ’s potential increase to home
downpayments may hurt real estate investment trusts, Ekspres
Invest and Tera Brokers said in reports today.  A possible increase in deposit requirements means home
sales could reach 350,000 to 400,000 this year, less than the
previous estimate of as much as 500,000, the Aksam newspaper
reported today, citing Real Estate Investment Trust Association
President Isik Gokkaya. The banking regulator may lift required
down payments to 40 percent from 25 percent, Bloomberg Haberturk
television reported yesterday.  “This will lead to deterioration in their cash flows,”
Istanbul-based Tera Brokers said in a research note.  REITs that may be hurt include  Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul
Yatirim Ortakligi AS (EKGYO)  and  Sinpas Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi
AS (SNGYO) , according to Ekspres’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
