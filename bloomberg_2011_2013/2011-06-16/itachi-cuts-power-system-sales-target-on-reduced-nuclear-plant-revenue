Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  lowered its target for
power-system sales next fiscal year by 3.3 percent as the
company expects less revenue from the nuclear energy business
than previously estimated.  Japan’s second-largest maker of nuclear reactors reduced
its sales target for the power-system business to 870 billion
yen ($11 billion) in the 12 months ending March 2013 from a
previous goal of 900 billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said
today in a statement. Hitachi also cut its goal for fiscal year
2015 to 1.1 trillion yen from 1.2 trillion yen.  The company said last week its nuclear business may
generate sales of 360 billion yen in the year ending March 2021,
5 percent less than its previous goal. Net income may drop 16
percent this fiscal year as  Japan ’s record earthquake and
tsunami on March 11 crippled Hitachi’s factories, the company
said on June 9.  Hitachi, which also makes solar plants and wind-power
facilities, aims to generate 280 billion yen in revenue from
renewable energy operations and power distribution in the year
ending March 2016, it said today.  Hitachi fell 1.1 percent to 469 yen as of 9:45 a.m. in
Tokyo trading, narrowing its gain this year to 8.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
