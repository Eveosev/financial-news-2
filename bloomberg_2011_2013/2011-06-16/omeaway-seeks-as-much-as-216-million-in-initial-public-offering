HomeAway Inc., a vacation-rental
website, set the price range for its initial public offering at
$24 to $27 a share, a market value of as much as $2.16 billion.  The Austin, Texas-based company will offer 8 million
shares, and is seeking to raise as much as $216 million,
according to a regulatory filing today.  HomeAway is the latest  Internet company  this year to make
about 10 percent of shares available to the public, after
online-radio service Pandora Media Inc. and professional-
networking website LinkedIn Corp. offered slightly smaller
stakes. Surging demand for new Internet companies, combined with
a dearth of available shares, can help boost valuations.  Property owners and managers pay annual fees to list
vacation rentals on HomeAway.com, which travelers use at no
charge. The site gets an average of 9.5 million unique visitors
a month, and had 560,000 listings worldwide as of March 31,
according to the filing.  HomeAway competes with online travel companies such as
 Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  and  Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , the filing said. While
these and other travel websites have traditionally focused on
hotel and airfare bookings, some are expanding into vacation
rentals, HomeAway said.  Expedia currently trades at about 2.2 times the past year’s
sales, while Priceline’s revenue multiple is about 6.9. At the
top of the proposed range, HomeAway would be valued at about
12.8 times 2010 sales.  Proceeds  HomeAway may use proceeds from its IPO for unpaid
dividends, acquisitions and new product lines. The company said
in March it expected to raise as much as $230 million in an IPO.  LinkedIn more than doubled on its first trading day May 19,
after selling 7.84 million shares at $45 apiece. The company had
raised the proposed range for the share sale on May 17, to $42
to $45, from $32 to $35.  Pandora raised $234.9 million in its IPO, selling 14.7
million shares at $16 each, topping the proposed range of $10 to
$12. The stock climbed 8.9 percent yesterday for its debut on
the New York Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
