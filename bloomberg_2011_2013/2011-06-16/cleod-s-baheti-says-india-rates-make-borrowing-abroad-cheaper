     June 16 (Bloomberg) --- Kamal Baheti, director of finance
at  McLeod Russel India Ltd. (MCLR) , the world’s biggest tea-grower,
comments after the  Reserve Bank  of India today raised its
benchmark repurchase rate to 7.5 percent from 7.25 percent, the
10th increase since the start of 2010.  “ Interest rates  are substantially elevated and from a
consumer perspective it will definitely have a negative impact
after increasing 10 times.  ‘‘With interest rate hikes, the capital expenditure of many
companies will be postponed and the slow down will continue as
long as interest rates are at such a high level.  ‘‘The kind of interest differential that has now come in,
companies that are into exports or otherwise can go overseas,
will increasingly look at borrowing abroad. In  India  the base
rate for borrowing will be about 9.5 percent while overseas,
even at fully hedged currency rate, it will be lower by 1
percent to 2 percent. If not hedged, it will be 3 percent to 4
percent lower than Indian borrowing costs. So, it is obviously
cheaper now to borrow overseas.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
