Natural gas futures dropped the most
in six weeks on speculation that U.S. supplies are adequate to
meet summer demand from  power plants .  Gas fell for a fourth day after the Energy Department said
stockpiles rose 69 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 10
to 2.256 trillion, matching estimates made by analysts before
the report was released. Gas reached a 10-month high on June 9
on forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather.  “It’s a seasonally low number, but we’ve had the heat and
these last two reports priced into the market, and now that
buying interest has gotten priced out,” said  Stephen Schork ,
president of Schork Group Inc., a consulting company in
Villanova, Pennsylvania. “The next couple of reports are
probably going to be more bearish.”  Natural gas for July delivery fell 16.5 cents, or 3.6
percent, to settle at $4.412 per million British thermal units
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the biggest percentage loss
since May 5. Prices have dropped 11 percent from a year ago.  Gas fell as low as $4.408, nearing the 200-day moving
average of $4.403.  “Breaking the moving average will cause some shorts to
enter the market,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for
IAF Advisors in Houston. “If we break the $4.40 mark, it’s
going to look further down to the $4.35 area.”  The five-year average storage change for the week is an
increase of 87 billion cubic feet, department data showed.  The stockpile increase “was supportive relative to an 87-
bcf five-year average, but that much had already been discounted
into the price and we think the market will quickly pivot to
looking ahead to near-average builds in the next few weeks,”
 Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York, said in an e-mail.  Gas Storage  Storage levels were 3.3 percent below the five-year average
for the week, wider than a deficit of 2.6 percent in the
previous report. Inventories were 10.9 percent below levels a
year earlier, compared with 10.4 percent reported last week.  Temperatures in  Washington  tied an 1874 record of 102
degrees Fahrenheit (39 Celsius) on June 9. The weather in the
East returned to normal this week.  A sample of scheduled gas deliveries to power plants in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 1 percent to 17 million
dekatherms (16.6 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg as of 2:55 p.m.  U.S. nuclear-power production rose to the highest level in
more than three months after reactors started in  Illinois ,
 Virginia  and Wisconsin, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
reported.  Hot Weather  Power generation increased 159 megawatts from yesterday to
92,172 megawatts, or 91 percent of capacity, according to the
NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the most
since March 3.  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  The weather will be hotter than normal across the U.S. East
and Midwest through June 30, according to Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The high temperature in New York will be 86 degrees on June
19, 6 degrees above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College , Pennsylvania.  The South and mid-Atlantic may be warmer than normal in
July and August, according to the latest 30- to 60-day forecast
from  MDA EarthSat Weather .  The most intense heat will build across  Texas  in July,
Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MDA predicts. The East Coast as far
north as  Connecticut  may be warmer than the 30-year average in
the same period.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
265,530 as of 2:40 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 319,000. Volume was a 245,590 yesterday. Open interest was
1,012,430 contracts, down from a record 1,013,660 yesterday. The
three-month average open interest is 947,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
