Japan ’s nuclear crisis will lead to
changes in U.S. reactor regulations, said William Magwood, a
member of the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission .  “I believe we will need to make some changes in a variety
of areas,” Magwood said today at a U.S. Senate hearing in
 Washington . He said the NRC is still “quite confident” that
U.S. nuclear plants are safe.  Lawmakers and regulators are taking a closer look at U.S.
reactors after a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on March 11
knocked out  power lines  and backup generators at  Tokyo  Electric
Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, about 135 miles (217
kilometers) north of Tokyo.  The disaster deprived the plant’s cooling systems of
electricity and some of its fuel rods overheated. The fires,
explosions and radiation leaks that followed triggered the worst
nuclear incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  The NRC, which is governed by a five-member panel, started
a 90-day review of U.S. reactor safety on March 23, which was
prompted by the accident in Japan. The  task force  leading the
review is scheduled to release a report next month.  NRC Commissioner George Apostolakis said the disaster in
Japan is a “lesson in humility” for nuclear regulators and he
agreed that changes are likely.  “We were pretty confident that there would be no new
surprises,” Apostolakis said at the hearing of the Senate
Environment and Public Works committee. “Fukushima has
questioned that belief.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
