Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA, the state
oil company, and the country’s central bank will create a
satellite account to measure the impact of oil on the economy,
Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said, according to  Agencia
Venezolana de Noticias .  The account will measure crude beyond what the central bank
calls oil gross domestic product by better gauging the
“behavior of volume,” AVN said, citing Ramirez. Ramirez also
said Venezuela has no plans to increase production unless the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries approves a change
to output quotas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
