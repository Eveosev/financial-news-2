Freezing the European Union’s budget
is not an option and risks hampering the region’s integration,
budget commissioner Janusz Lewandowski told  Germany ’s
 Handelsblatt newspaper  in an interview.  “We wouldn’t be able to meet our obligations, which the
member countries also agreed to, and challenges we’ve identified
for the future,” Lewandowski was quoted as saying. “Freezing
the budget is not an option because a freeze would mean a
significant nominal decline over the years, up to 30 percent
until the year 2020.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
