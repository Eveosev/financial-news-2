Chile ’s peso fell for a second day
as concern about Europe’s debt crisis and lower commodity prices
reduced demand for riskier, emerging-market assets.  The peso lost 0.6 percent to 471.50 per  U.S. dollar  at 1:29
p.m. New York time from 468.75 yesterday, the weakest close in
three weeks.  “The peso fell today because of the situation in Greece
and lower copper prices,” said Flavio Magnasco, an economist at
Banco Falabella in Santiago.  European stocks and the euro fell after Greek Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  changed his cabinet and called for a
confidence vote as the European Union continues talks on
hammering out a new bailout to prevent a default. The euro fell
as much as 0.8 percent. Copper, which accounts for half of
Chile’s exports, fell as much as 1.8 percent in  New York  to
$4.065 a pound.  The central bank paid an average 471.42 per dollar for $50
million as part of a $12 billion program to slow the peso’s
gain, according to data posted on its website. The monetary
authority also sold 44 billion pesos ($93 million) in two- and
five-year peso bonds today priced to yield 6.02 percent and 6.22
percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
