European coal prices fell for a
second straight day on sufficient U.S. and Colombian supplies of
the fuel and stockpiles already held on the continent.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year fell $1.50, or 1.1 percent, to $129.50 a
metric ton by 12:22 p.m. in  London . A close at that level would
be the lowest since June 3 and is a 1.8 percent slide in its
current run.  “There are ample stocks and healthy flows from the U.S.
and  Colombia ” for  Europe , Miswin Mahesh, a London-based analyst
with  Barclays Capital , said in a report e-mailed today. “We
expect there to be little potential upside for API2 prices from
current levels for the remainder of the summer.” API2 refers to
prices for coal delivered to North-West Europe.  The Port of Rotterdam’s largest coal-storage company,
Europees Massagoed-Overslagbedrijf BV, said on June 14 that
stockpiles are at 3 million tons as low water levels in the
Rhine River impede barge transport of the commodity. That’s up
from 2.1 million tons at the beginning of April. Colombian coal
exports were worth $629 million in April, according to the
central bank. That’s the most since January and a 26 percent
increase on March.  Profit from running coal-fired power plants for the next
month, the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 5.78 euros
($8.16) a megawatt-hour, compared with 2.53 euros from burning
natural gas, Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses
electricity prices in  Germany , Europe’s biggest energy consumer,
and takes emission costs into account.  December carbon-dioxide permits under the European Union
cap-and-trade system were 0.8 percent lower at 16.12 euros a
ton. Gas for delivery in the six months through September 2012
to the U.K., Europe’s biggest consumer of the fuel, declined 1.8
percent to 66.25 pence ($1.07) a therm in London.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
