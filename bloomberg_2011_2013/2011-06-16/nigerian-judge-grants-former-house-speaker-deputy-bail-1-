The former speaker of  Nigeria ’s
House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole, and his deputy, Usman
Nafada, were granted bail at the High Court in the capital,
Abuja, in connection with a graft investigation.  High Court Judge Suleiman Belgore granted the two men bail
of 50 million naira ($320,000) and two sureties each today in a
case in which they are charged with 17 counts of fraud over a 38
billion-naira corruption probe. Belgore ordered them to submit
their travel documents to the court and fixed the trial for July
19. The two men will be remanded in the custody of the  Economic
and Financial Crimes Commission , the anti-graft agency, until
their bail conditions have been met.  Bankole, 41, is also facing a separate 16 counts of fraud
in connection with a 1 billion-naira graft investigation at the
Federal  High Court  in Abuja.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, ranks 134th on a list
of 178 nations on a corruption index compiled by Berlin-based
graft monitor,  Transparency International .  The West African country lost about $380 billion to
corruption between independence in 1960 and the end of military
rule in 1999, New York-based  Human Rights Watch  said in an
October 2007 report.  The case is Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Dimeji Bankole,
