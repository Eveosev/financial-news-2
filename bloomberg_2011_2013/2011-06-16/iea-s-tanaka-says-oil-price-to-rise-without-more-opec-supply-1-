Oil prices  may increase if OPEC
fails to bolster production and inventories decline, the head of
the International Energy Agency said.  Supplies may become “very tight” if the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries doesn’t increase production to
meet higher demand in July, Executive Director  Nobuo Tanaka  said
today in an interview with Bloomberg Television in St.
Petersburg, Russia. Saudi Arabia is likely to deliver on its
pledge to keep markets adequately supplied, he said.  Brent crude futures have advanced 20 percent this year,
trading today at $113 a barrel in London, as world consumption
increases and conflict halts exports from Libya, holder of
Africa’s largest reserves.  If prices remain at $110 to $120 for the rest of the year,
the “burden on the global economy would be as bad as 2008, when
the economy made a hard landing,” Tanaka said. The agency is
prepared to coordinate a release of emergency stockpiles if the
gap between supply and demand remains, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
