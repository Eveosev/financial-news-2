Gold rose for the third straight day
as volatility in the  currency markets  boosted demand for the
precious metal as an alternative investment.  The euro fell to a three-week low against the dollar on
speculation that Greece’s sovereign-debt crisis will worsen as
talks over another aid package stalled. The greenback has
dropped 12 percent in the past year against a basket of major
currencies. Gold priced in British pounds rose to a record
today.  “Gold is now a currency,” said  Dennis Gartman , an
economist and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman
Letter. “Gold is strong and growing stronger.”  On the Comex in  New York , gold futures for August delivery
rose $3.70, or 0.2 percent, to settle at $1,529.90 an ounce at
1:46 p.m.. The price gained 0.7 percent in the previous two
sessions. The metal has advanced 24 percent in the past 12
months.  Implied volatility for one-week Eurodollar options surged
to the highest since November. The measure signals the expected
pace of swings in the underlying currency.  Gold rose to a record $1,577.40 on May 2 as escalating
sovereign-debt woes and record-low U.S. borrowing costs
increased the appeal of the metal as an alternative to
currencies. The price denominated in euros reached an all-time
high on May 25.  ‘Roll the Dice’  “Investors don’t want to roll the dice on being caught in
one particular currency or the other,” said  Adam Klopfenstein ,
a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in  Chicago .
“There is gravitation toward the gold market to diversify away
from paper currencies.”  Silver futures for July delivery rose 14.9 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $35.559 an ounce on the Comex. The price has jumped
93 percent in the past year.  Platinum futures for July delivery fell $13.50, or 0.8
percent, to $1,760.70 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The metal dropped for the fifth straight session, the
longest slump since December. The price has gained 12 percent in
the past year.  Palladium futures for September delivery fell $12.50, or
1.6 percent, to $763.50 an ounce. The metal declined for the
fifth straight session, the longest slide since March. The price
has gained 61 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
