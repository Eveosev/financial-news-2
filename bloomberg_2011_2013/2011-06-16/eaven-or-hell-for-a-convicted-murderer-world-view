In  Russia , the open wounds of history are all too seldom treated with the balm of truth. Exhibit A: the case of a convicted killer who received a hero's funeral, and whose own murder could yet spark inter-ethnic violence. Yury Budanov, a decorated colonel and veteran of Russia's brutal war in the southern republic of Chechnya, served eight years in prison for the 2000 murder of an 18-year-old Chechen girl, Elza Kungayeva, who he said he believed to be a sniper. The verdict angered Russian nationalists, who came to idolize Budanov. Chechens and other minorities, to put it mildly, felt less charitably inclined. Last Friday, Budanov met his own end when an unidentified assailant gunned him down in central Moscow. Tom Washington of the  Moscow News  recounted the grisly deed: The murder brought the conflicting truths about Budanov back to the surface. Since the collapse of the  Soviet Union  in 1991, tensions have often run high between ethnic Russians and the country’s multitudinous Muslim minorities (including the Chechens), a good number of whom reside in the North Caucasus. As Natalya Krainova of the  Moscow Times  reported: The radio station  Ekho Moskvy  ominously reported that Russian nationalists were issuing calls online for a Saturday demonstration. Authorities stepped up security in central Moscow. Yelena Milashina, of the opposition daily  Novaya Gazeta , outlined a case for calm, writing that “Ethnic hatred ends not in blood vengeance, but in a bloody mess.” Reached in  Norway , Visa Kungayev, the father of the victim, did little to dispel fears of bloodshed, telling  Gazeta.ru  that Budanov’s murder was a “provocation,” before declaring the deceased colonel got what he deserved -- “a dog’s death for a dog.” The weekend passed without incident, but Budanov’s funeral on Monday was hardly that of a disgraced army officer, let alone a convicted murderer. The  funeral  took place at a cemetery in the Khimki district on the outskirts of Moscow. Oleg Kashin and Musa Muradov of the newspaper  Kommersant  reported that the crowd greeted the bus carrying Budanov's coffin Kashin and Muradov gathered opinions from those present. A seminary teacher said she “came to ask forgiveness of Budanov for our cowardice. We hid our children from the army, we sent them away to study, but he alone went to fight for us all, and we let him be put on trial.” A functionary of the “Russian Imperial Movement” vowed that “. . . we’ll get them all, we’ll avenge them all.” Another woman: “He did so much good for people. Even soldiers he didn’t know sent him gifts in prison.” Budanov’s imprisonment hardly entailed a regime of bread and water. The opposition blogger Yulia Latynina wrote in the  Moscow Times  that he Budanov's priest, Father Mikhail, delivered a sermon savoring more of hagiography than patriotism, according to Kashin and Muradov. In an apparent reference to a deceased hero from Russia’s past, Father Mikhail claimed that “the murdered warrior Georgi has been reborn throughout Russia. [Budanov] is a warrior of the spirit, and now more than ever is serving Russia.” Father Mikhail proceeded to beatify his former parishioner. “We’ve acquired a new saint. [Budanov] will be praying for us all in heaven, alongside [national heroes] Alexander Nevsky, Dmitry Donskoy, and Yevgeny Rodionov” – a Russian paratrooper who, captured by rebels in 1996, refused to accept Islam in return for his life and was brutally executed. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a radical nationalist member of Russia's parliament, stirred things up further, declaring from the podium that he would “make every effort to ensure that they restore the rank of colonel and his Order of Courage to him, and name a street after him in a Russian city. Yury Budanov’s murder is a challenge thrown down to the whole Russian people.” In the wake of the spectacle, the  Moscow Times  editorialized: Both Kungayeva and Budanov met bloody ends. But the climate of “legal nihilism” famously decried by President  Dmitry Medvedev  lives on, and inter-ethnic animosities smolder away, ever on the brink of eruption, threatening the very unity of the Russian state.
