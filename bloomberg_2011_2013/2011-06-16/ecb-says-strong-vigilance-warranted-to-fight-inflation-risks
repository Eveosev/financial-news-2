The  European Central Bank  said
“strong vigilance” is warranted to contain inflation,
signaling it’s ready to raise borrowing costs next month.  “Risks to the outlook for  price stability  are on the
upside,” the Frankfurt-based central bank said in its monthly
bulletin today, echoing President  Jean-Claude Trichet ’s June 9
policy statement. The ECB “will act in a firm and timely
manner” to “prevent recent price developments giving rise to
broad-based inflationary pressures,” it said.  ECB policy makers have signaled concern that oil-driven
price pressures will feed into wage demands, sparking more
persistent inflation. At the same time, governments are
struggling to contain the region’s debt crisis and restore
investor confidence. Trichet told  CNN  in an interview on June 13
that while an increase in the benchmark interest rate from 1.25
percent is “possible” next month, it’s “not certain.”  The central bank last week forecast inflation will average
about 2.6 percent in 2011 and 1.7 percent in 2012. ECB Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said June 10 that policy makers are
aiming for a “gradual and timely” monetary tightening.  “It remains of paramount importance that” faster
inflation “does not translate into second-round effects in
price and wage-setting behavior,” the ECB said. “Inflation
expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the
Governing Council’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below,
but close to, 2 percent over the medium term.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
