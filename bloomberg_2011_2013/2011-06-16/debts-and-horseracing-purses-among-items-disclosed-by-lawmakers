U.S. Representative Alcee Hastings
is still paying for his impeachment and conviction as a federal
judge, a case that began three decades ago.  Hastings, a  Florida  Democrat, owes between $2.1 million and
$7.4 million in legal fees incurred between 1981 and 1989,
according to his personal financial disclosure statement
released yesterday.  The annual financial disclosure reports allow lawmakers to
list their income and liabilities in broad ranges, making it
impossible to determine their exact amounts. The documents do
provide a glimpse into the range of wealth among members of
Congress, the ways some supplement their government checks, and
debts that some incur.  Representative  Darrell Issa , a California Republican and
chairman of the  House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ,
reported a more than $75 million business line of credit, all
secured with personal funds. Issa also had assets valued at more
than $200 million.  Freshman Republican Representative Rick Berg of  North
Dakota  reported business and real estate loans of between $1.5
million and $6 million.  Senator  Marco Rubio , a Florida Republican elected last
year, reported owing $100,000 to $250,000 in student loans.
Representative John Carter, a Texas Republican, reported debts
of between $230,004 and $600,000, including a bank loan incurred
more than 25 years ago, student loans from around 1998, and
credit card debts from around 1990.  Other Debts  Senator  Maria Cantwell , a Washington state Democrat,
carried loans of between $1 million and $5 million from her 2000
campaign. Laura Richardson, a California Democrat, reported
owing between $150,000 and $350,000 in legal fees. The  House
Ethics Committee  last year dismissed allegations that she got
special treatment from Washington Mutual Inc. in regards to some
property in  Sacramento .  Hastings, 74, was named as a U.S. District Court judge in
1979 in Florida and was indicted two years later for conspiring
to solicit bribes. Acquitted by a jury in 1983, he was impeached
by the House in 1988 and convicted and removed from office by
the Senate the following year. Hastings appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court in an unsuccessful attempt to overturn the
verdict. He won his House seat in 1992.  Track Winner  The reports disclose ways House members and senators, who
have base salaries of $174,000, supplement their income.
Representative Dennis Cardoza, a California Democrat, collected
purses between $56,007 and $177,500 from his racehorses,
including one named Unanimous Consent.  Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, won
$24,835.33 in his state’s lottery. Julie Reichert, wife of
Representative Dave Reichert, a  Washington  state Republican, won
between $201 and $1,000 at a casino. Representative Paul Tonko,
a New York Democrat, won $2,052 in gift cards at a raffle
benefitting a regional food bank in his home state.  Senator Scott Brown, the Massachusetts Republican who won
the late Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy’s seat in a special
election last year, reported receiving a $700,000 book advance
for his autobiography published earlier this year.  Representative Mary Bono Mack, a California Republican who
was married to the late singer and House member Sonny Bono,
reported music royalties of between $100,000 and $1 million.
Senator  Orrin Hatch , a Utah Republican, received $10,381 in
music and book royalties.  The reports also offer insight into the lawmakers’ stock
investments, some of which are related to the work they do on
 Capitol Hill .  House Panel  Some members of the  House Financial Services Committee ,
which last year crafted the most extensive financial regulations
since the Great Depression, held stock in institutions that come
under the panel’s oversight.  Michigan Democrat Gary Peters held between $15,000 and
$50,000 in American International Group, while Illinois
Republican Robert Dold, a freshman, held between $1,000 and
$15,000 of stock in the troubled insurer that received $67.8
billion in funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, bought
between $1,000 and $15,000 of  BP Plc (BP/)  stock on Feb. 1, and sold
it on April 27, one week after the Deepwater Horizon drilling
rig exploded. Representative Tom Petri, a Wisconsin Republican,
reported income of between $1 million and $5 million in
dividends from his holdings in Lloyd’s of  London .  Rangel’s Villa  Representative Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat,
reported selling his Punta Cana Beach Villa in December for
between $250,000 and $500,000. Rangel was censured last year by
the House for ethics violations, including failing to pay taxes
on money he earned from renting out the villa in the Dominican
Republic. As part of its censure resolution, the House voted to
require him to pay those taxes.  Representative  John Lewis , a Georgia Democrat and a leader
in the 1960s civil rights movement, was one of the few lawmakers
who reported a large number of paid trips.  Lewis divulged that he took 18 trips last year, including
to an NAACP meeting in  St. Louis . He also went on a trip to
Orlando, Florida, paid for by the International Association of
Firefighters; and made a visit, paid by  Major League Baseball ,
to the annual Civil Rights Game in Cincinnati that pitted the
hometown Reds against the  St. Louis Cardinals .  To contact the reporter on this story:
