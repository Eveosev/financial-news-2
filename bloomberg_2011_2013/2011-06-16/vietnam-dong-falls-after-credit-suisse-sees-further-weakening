Vietnam’s dong fell by the most in
three weeks after Credit Suisse Group AG said the currency’s
recent stability will likely be temporary and it will resume
weakening by year-end.  Government bonds  dropped.  The dong will decline 1.4 percent to 20,900 per dollar by
the end of 2011 and reach 21,400 by the end of next year,
according to a Credit Suisse research note released today, which
also said the currency’s recent steadiness was driven more by
administrative measures than monetary tightening.  “A combination of higher inflation, slower growth, and
signs of financial distress are likely to spark concerns among
investors in the coming months,” wrote Santitarn Sathirathai, a
Singapore-based economist at Credit Suisse.  The dong slid 0.2 percent to 20,613 per dollar as of 3:43
p.m. in Hanoi, the biggest decline since May 25, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The currency, which was devalued in February for the fourth
time since 2009, has traded between 20,346 and 20,760 per dollar
this month, a range of less than 2 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Vietnam ’s central bank said this month it
would increase the reserve-requirement ratio on U.S. dollar
deposits by a percentage point, while also cutting the interest-
rate cap on dollar deposits for individuals to 2 percent from 3
percent and that for institutions to 0.5 percent from 1 percent.  Yields on benchmark five-year bonds rose nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 12.63 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The State Bank of Vietnam set the  reference rate  at 20,618
per dollar today, unchanged from yesterday, its website showed.
The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side
of the official rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang. With assistance from Jason Folkmanis in  Ho
