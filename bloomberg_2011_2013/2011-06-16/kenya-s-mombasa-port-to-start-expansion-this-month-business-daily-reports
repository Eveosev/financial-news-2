Kenya  will start a 10 billion-
shilling ($113 million) expansion of its Mombasa port this
month, Business Daily reported, citing Kenya Ports Authority
Managing Director Gichiri Ndua.  The facility will be dredged of mud and silt to accomodate
larger ships, while construction of the new No. 19 cargo berth
will also begin, the Nairobi-based newspaper said. The dredging,
which will deepen the port to 15 meters, is expected to be
completed in 18 months, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
