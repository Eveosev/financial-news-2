KKR & Co. and Permira Advisers LLP
are seeking to amend terms of loans to allow them to cut their
stake in  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM)  without triggering a debt
repayment, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The two private-equity firms, which own 53 percent of
ProSiebenSat.1 through investment vehicle Lavena Holding, asked
lenders for permission to reduce their holding of voting shares
to as little as 35.1 percent before being required to repay debt
used to buy the German broadcaster in 2007, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the request is private.  KKR and Permira would need to raise about 2 billion euros
($2.8 billion) in an IPO to repay all of the debt, according to
one of the people. The proposed amendment would allow them to
sell just a portion of their stake and repay some of the loans,
without breaching conditions that would trigger a full
repayment. The loans to Lavena start coming due in 2015,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  KKR and Permira currently hold 88 percent of  voting rights .
At present a so-called change-of-control clause would prompt a
full debt repayment if their portion of voting share capital
fell to 50 percent or below, the people said.  The private-equity firms also asked lenders to permit
proceeds from asset sales to be used to cut ProSiebenSat.1’s
operating company debt, according to the people. At the moment,
these proceeds must be used for new acquisitions or stay as cash
on the broadcaster’s balance sheet, the people said.  UniCredit SpA is coordinating the amendment, for which
lenders are being offered a fee of 10 basis points, the people
said. The deadline for approval is June 27.  Julian Geist, a spokesman for Unterfoerhring, Germany-based
ProSiebenSat.1, a Permira spokesman in  London  and Christoph Kreileder, an external spokesman for New York-based KKR, all
declined to comment.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The news was
reported previously by Standard & Poor’s LCD and Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
