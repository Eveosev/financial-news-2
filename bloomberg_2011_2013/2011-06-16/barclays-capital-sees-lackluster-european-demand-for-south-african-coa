European demand for South African
coal will likely be “lackluster” over the next two months
because of ample supplies and imports from the U.S. and
 Colombia ,  Barclays Capital  said in a report today.  “We expect a greater pull for coal in  Europe  at the end of
the third quarter that intensifies by the beginning of the
fourth quarter,” the bank said in the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
