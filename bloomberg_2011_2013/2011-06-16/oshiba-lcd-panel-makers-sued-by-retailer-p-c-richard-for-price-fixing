(Corrects story published June 16 to say “spokesman” in
fifth paragraph.)  Toshiba Corp. (6502) , Sharp Corp. and at
least 13 other makers of liquid-crystal displays were sued by
retailer  P.C. Richard & Son Inc.  over claims they conspired to
fix prices.  Beginning about 1996, the companies “met in person or
communicated by other means to agree on LCD product prices and
the amount of LCD products each would produce,” according to
the complaint filed today in federal court in  Brooklyn ,  New York .  In addition to Farmingdale, New York-based P.C. Richard,
the suit was filed by Pontiac, Michigan-based ABC Appliance Inc.,
which runs retailer ABC Warehouse, and Marta Cooperative of
America Inc., a buying cooperative based in Scottsdale,  Arizona .  Seven of the defendants have admitted to participating in
the conspiracy and paid millions of dollars in criminal fines,
according to the lawsuit. Best Buy Co., the world’s largest
consumer-electronics retailer, sued the display makers last year.  Keisuke Oomori, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Toshiba, said
the company is checking on the matter. Miyuki Nakayama, a
spokeswoman for  Osaka , Japan-based Sharp, declined to comment.  The case is P.C. Richard & Son Long Island Corp. v. AU
Optronics Corp., 11-2903, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
