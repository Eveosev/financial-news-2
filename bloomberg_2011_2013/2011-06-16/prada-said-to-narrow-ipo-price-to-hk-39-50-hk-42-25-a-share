Prada SpA cut the maximum amount it
is seeking in an initial public offering in  Hong Kong  to $2.3
billion, from $2.6 billion previously, two people familiar with
the matter said.  Prada is now offering shares at HK$39.50 to HK$42.25
apiece, said the people who declined to be identified because
the information is private. That compares with HK$36.50 to
HK$48.00 earlier, according to the IPO prospectus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
