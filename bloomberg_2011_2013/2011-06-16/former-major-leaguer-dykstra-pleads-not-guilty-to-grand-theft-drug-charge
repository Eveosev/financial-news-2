Lenny Dykstra, the former  New York
Mets  and Philadelphia Phillies outfielder, pleaded not guilty to
charges he tried to lease cars using phony business and credit
information and drug possession charges.  Dykstra entered a not guilty plea today at an arraignment
hearing in San Fernando Superior Court, Jane Robison, a
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district attorney’s office, said
in a telephone interview. The former baseball player is due back
in court July 11 to set a date for a preliminary hearing,
Robison said.  Dykstra, 48, and two co-defendants are accused of trying to
lease cars from several dealerships with fraudulent information
starting in January. When he was arrested April 14, Los Angeles
police detectives found cocaine, ecstasy and a synthetic human
growth hormone at his home in Encino,  California , according to
the district attorney’s office.  Andrew Flier, a lawyer for Dykstra, didn’t immediately
return a call to his office.  On June 13, Dykstra pleaded not guilty in a separate
federal case to charges he stole or destroyed more than $400,000
worth of property from his bankrupt estate.  Dykstra faces as long as 12 years in prison if convicted on
the grand theft, attempted grand theft, drug and other charges,
according to the district attorney’s office. He remains in
custody on $500,000 bail.  The case is the People v. Dykstra, PA070678, Los Angeles
County Superior Court (San Fernando).  To contact the reporter on this story:
