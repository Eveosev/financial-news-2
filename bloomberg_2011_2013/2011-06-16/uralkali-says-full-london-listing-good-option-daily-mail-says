OAO  Uralkali (URKA) , the Russian potash
producer taking over OAO Silvinit, said a full London listing is
a “good option for the future,” the U.K. Daily Mail reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner. No bank
advisers have yet been appointed, the Mail said.  Uralkali (URKA)  already trades global depositary receipts in the
U.K. capital.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
