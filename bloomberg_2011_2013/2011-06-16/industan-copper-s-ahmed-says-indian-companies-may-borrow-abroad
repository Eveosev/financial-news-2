Shakeel Ahmed, chairman of  Hindustan
Copper Ltd. (HCP) , India’s monopoly miner of the ore used to extract
the metal, comments after the  Reserve Bank  of India today raised
 interest rates  for the fourth time this year.  “The rate hike may hurt sales and profitability of Indian
companies, and may also delay investment decisions. The impact
will be felt across the board, but mostly in sectors like real
estate, automobile and infrastructure.  “Companies will now expect to raise money overseas,
because the cost of raising funds is lower.  “Hindustan Copper will need about 2.07 billion rupees ($46
million) in the 12 months ending March 2014 and I will prefer to
raise it from overseas markets. The board will have to take the
final decision.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
