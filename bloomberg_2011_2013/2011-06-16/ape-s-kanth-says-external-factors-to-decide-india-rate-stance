Kislay Kanth, head of research at
MAPE Securities Pvt., comments on  India ’s interest rates.  The  Reserve Bank  of India today raised the repurchase rate
by a quarter percentage point to 7.5 percent. Nineteen of 20
economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted the decision,
while one expected no change. Kanth spoke in a phone interview
from Mumbai.  “The central bank still appears to be hawkish in its
stance, probably because it believes that some sectors still
enjoy pricing power even as industrial output and overall
economic growth is showing signs of deceleration.  ‘‘For its inflation management objective the central bank
will have to tighten policy further.  ‘‘Compared with external factors, the domestic factors are
far more predictable now. Chances of domestic factors springing
surprises are less, while on the other hand external factors
haven’t been priced in yet.  ‘‘In coming weeks and months developments abroad,
particularly relating to U.S. economic growth and the Greece
debt situation, will have a greater bearing on the central
bank’s policy actions than local factors.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
