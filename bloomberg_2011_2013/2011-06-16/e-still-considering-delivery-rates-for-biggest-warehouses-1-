The London Metal Exchange, which
handled $11.6 trillion worth of contracts last year, is still
considering a proposal to increase the amount of metal that has
to be delivered from the biggest stockpiles.  The LME increased minimum daily delivery rates from
inventory above 300,000 metric tons, the exchange said today in
a notice to members. It is still considering changing the rules
for stockpiles above 900,000 tons.  Warehouses are currently obliged to deliver a minimum of
between 800 tons to 1,500 tons daily. Global aluminum stockpiles
monitored by the exchange rose fivefold to 4.61 million tons
since the end of 2007. Withdrawing the metal from LME-approved
warehouses in  Detroit  can take as long as 7 1/2 months,
according to  Harbor Intelligence , a Laredo, Texas-based research
company.  Minimum daily delivery sizes will be 2,000 tons for sites
holding between 300,000 tons and 600,000 tons, and 2,500 tons
for sites with 600,000 tons to 900,000 tons. The change takes
effect April 1. The board “will give further consideration” to
the proposal to raise minimum delivery rates for stockpiles
above 900,000 tons.  The LME, home to the world’s biggest copper and aluminum
contracts, hired Europe Economics to study warehouse deliveries.
The exchange announced the report results in May.  Aluminum in Detroit  The issue “is specific to aluminum and to one location,”
Chief Executive Officer Martin Abbott said last month. Detroit
holds 25 percent of the LME-monitored aluminum stockpiles.  According to the proposal, warehouses storing at least
900,000 tons of metal would be required to release at least
3,000 tons a day.  Detroit is the only LME-approved site storing more than
900,000 tons of aluminum, exchange figures show. Nineteen of 23
warehouses in the city belong to Metro International Trade
Services LLC, according to the LME  website . The company was
acquired by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last year.  Inventories of the lightweight metal in the U.S. city,
known for its ties to the  auto industry , surged more than
sevenfold in 2008. That was the year the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. jolted the world economy, forcing
carmakers General Motors Co. and Chrysler Group LLC to seek
government bailouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
