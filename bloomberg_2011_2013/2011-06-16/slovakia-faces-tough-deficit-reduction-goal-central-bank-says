The Slovak government has set a
“tough” goal of reducing the public finance shortfall in the
next three years and economic recovery may provide only limited
help in narrowing the gap, the central bank said.  The government plans to cut the deficit to less than the
European Union’s limit of 3 percent of economic output by 2013,
after the gap reached 7.9 percent of gross domestic product in
2010, the Bratislava-based National Bank of Slovakia said in an
update of the Financial Stability Report published today in its
website.  “The government has set a tough target to reach a deficit
of below 3 percent of GDP in 2013,” the central bank said.  The Cabinet of Premier Iveta Radicova, in power since July,
has already cut spending and raised excise and value-added taxes
to narrow the budget gap, which widened after the economy
slipped into a recession two years ago. The four-party coalition
still needs to agree on more budget measures at a time when
austerity is causing its popularity to drop.  “The assessment of pre-crisis structural position was
overly optimistic and the public-finance deficit is to a large
extent a structural problem,” the central bank said. “This
means that a renewed revival may help narrow the deficit in a
limited way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
