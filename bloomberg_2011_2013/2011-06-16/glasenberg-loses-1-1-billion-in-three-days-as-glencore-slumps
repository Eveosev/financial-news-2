Glencore International Plc shares
gained for the first time in three days in London trading,
paring the decline in the value of Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg’s stake to about $900 million over the period.  Glasenberg, 54, owns 15.7 percent of the trader that ended
more than three decades as a closely held company last month
with an initial public offering. The stock rose 0.6 percent
today, after falling as much as 4.4 percent. His stake is worth
about $8.3 billion, compared with $9.2 billion on June 13.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and  Abu Dhabi ’s Aabar Investments PJSC are
among so-called cornerstone shareholders to have lost about $310
million of the value of their $3.1 billion investment in the
London and Hong Kong float because of the stock’s 10 percent
slump from its IPO price. Glencore reported first-quarter profit
of $1.3 billion on June 14, a result Nomura International Plc
said was disappointing.  “We expect the current quarter could also disappoint,”
Deutsche Bank AG analysts Grant Sporre, Rob Clifford and Gaetan
De Buyer, wrote in a report today. They cut their price estimate
for the stock to 620 pence from 650 pence and maintained a
“buy” rating. “A weak second quarter is likely to see share-
price performance face headwinds over the near-term.” First-
half results are due Aug. 25.  Glencore fell 5.4 percent yesterday and 4.5 percent June
14. Today’s 475.8 pence close values the Baar, Switzerland-based
company at 32.9 billion pounds ($53.1 billion).  Biggest IPO  Glencore started trading May 19 after selling stock at 530
pence apiece for $10 billion in the world’s biggest IPO this
year.  Glasenberg, an accounting graduate, has been at Glencore
since 1984 and CEO since 2002. He was part of a management-led
buyout of the business from founder and former fugitive U.S.
financier  Marc Rich  in 1994. The IPO also created billionaires
in directors Daniel Mate, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and
Alex Beard. Glasenberg is the biggest holder with 1.086 billion
shares.  The value of Glasenberg’s stake at the time of the IPO
exceeded what the founders of Google Inc. and  Blackstone Group
LP (BX)  reaped in their IPOs.  Stephen Schwarzman ’s holding in
Blackstone was $8.8 billion when the New York-based private-
equity firm went public in 2007, while Google founders  Larry Page  and  Sergey Brin  held $3.28 billion and $3.27 billion of the
Internet search company’s stock at its 2004 IPO.  ‘Overpriced’ Stock  Glencore, which buys and sells commodities such as coal,
grains and metals, employs 2,700 people at trading units in 40
nations and about 54,800 people at industrial operations in more
than 30 countries.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of commodities tumbled the
most in a month yesterday as the price of oil fell to its lowest
in almost four months. Glencore trades about 3 percent of the
world’s oil.  Glencore is “overpriced” and a range of 360 pence to 400
pence for the stock “is not unreasonable,” Ben Wedmore, an
analyst at MF Global FXA Securities Ltd. in  Tokyo , wrote today
in a report. He rated the stock a “sell” as he initiated
coverage.  Glencore’s first-quarter earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of $2 billion were 6 percent lower
than Nomura’s estimate, analyst Paul Cliff said in a June 14
note. Deutsche Bank said today Glencore’s adjusted earnings
before interest and tax missed its estimate by 8 percent.  The “key negative” from the earnings report was a 20
percent decline in profit at its metals and minerals trading
unit, Deutsche Bank said.  Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley
managed the IPO as global coordinators, along with Bank of
America Corp. and BNP Paribas SA as joint bookrunners. Barclays
Plc, Societe Generale SA and UBS AG were co-bookrunners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
