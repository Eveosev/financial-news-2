The Australian and New Zealand
dollars declined to three-week lows against their U.S.
counterpart as speculation  Greece ’s debt crisis is worsening
damped demand for higher-yielding assets.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, also weakened
after Finance Minister  Bill English  said its strength was
hurting the economy and that keeping  interest rates  low will
help growth. The kiwi fell against all of its 16 most-traded
peers.  U.S. data showed an unexpected contraction in
manufacturing in the Philadelphia region, following a factory
measure yesterday that showed an unexpected drop in New York.  “The risk-off mood is dominant in the markets because of
concerns over Greece and a slowdown in the U.S. growth, sending
stocks and commodities lower,” said Takuya Kawabata, a
researcher in  Tokyo  at Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd., a
unit of  Japan ’s largest currency margin company. “In this
environment, money wouldn’t find its way into commodity
currencies such as the Aussie and kiwi.”  Australia ’s dollar weakened 0.6 percent to $1.0512 at 3:03
p.m. in New York, from $1.0577 yesterday. It touched $1.0478,
the least since May 25. The currency dropped 1 percent to 84.80
yen, from 85.63 yen.  The New Zealand dollar depreciated 0.9 percent to 79.97
U.S. cents after earlier reaching 79.72 cents, the weakest since
May 26. It slid as much as 1.5 percent to 64.34 yen, the lowest
since May 23, before trading at 64.54 yen, down 1.2 percent.  Stock Slump  Global equities dropped, with the MSCI World Index losing
1.1 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.4 percent after
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index fell to minus 7.7 in June, the lowest since July 2009,
from 3.9 the prior month. Readings less than zero signal
contraction. The  New York  Fed’s Empire State manufacturing index
for June expectedly dropped to 7.8 yesterday.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
was down 0.6 percent after falling 2.3 percent yesterday, the
most in five weeks.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said yesterday he
would reshuffle his Cabinet and then call a confidence vote in
parliament after attempts to garner opposition support for an
austerity plan failed. Confidence debates in Greece typically
take three days with the ballot at midnight, meaning the vote
isn’t likely before the evening of June 19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
