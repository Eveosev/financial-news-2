OAO AvtoVAZ surged for a third day
after the Nikkei newspaper reported Nissan Motor Co. and Renault
SA are in talks to take a controlling stake in the Russian
automaker.  The shares jumped as much as 8.4 percent and last traded
5.4 percent higher at 27.80 rubles by 11:41 a.m. in Moscow.  Nissan is likely to pay as much as $1 billion for 25
percent, which will give the Nissan-Renault alliance slightly
more than 50 percent, according to the report, which didnâ€™t cite
anyone. Renault already owns just over 25 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
