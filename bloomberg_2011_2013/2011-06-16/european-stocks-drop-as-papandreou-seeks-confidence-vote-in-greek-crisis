European stocks fell for a second
day as Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said he will
reshuffle his cabinet and seek a confidence vote. U.S. futures
and Asian shares also dropped.  Rio Tinto Group led declines in basic-resource shares as
metal prices fell.  Lenzing AG (LNZ)  dropped 5.2 percent as the
Austrian maker of textile fibers is raising capital.  Carrefour
SA (CA)  slipped 1.7 percent as UBS AG recommended selling shares of
the French retailer. Demag Cranes AG retreated 0.6 percent even
as the company said  Terex Corp. (TEX)  raised its offer for the
company.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.5 percent to
266.49 as of 8:05 a.m. in London. The gauge has fallen 8.5
percent from this year’s high on Feb. 17 as a slowdown in U.S.
job creation suggested the economic recovery may be faltering
and speculation grew that  Greece  might default on its debt.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures fell 0.1 percent today,
while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
