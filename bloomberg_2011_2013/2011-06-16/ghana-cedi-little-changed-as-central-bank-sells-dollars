Ghana’s  currency, the cedi was
little changed against the  U.S. dollar  after the country’s
central bank sold enough foreign exchange to meet demand.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
traded at 1.5155 per dollar as of 1:25 p.m. in Accra, the
capital, unchanged from yesterday’s close.  “The central bank sold between $15 million and $20
million,” Chris Nettey, a currency trader at Stanbic Bank Ghana
Ltd., said by phone today. “The sales helped to match demand on
the market, from traders and manufacturers.”  Adams Nyinaku, the head of treasury at the  Bank of Ghana ,
was not available to comment, said a man who answered the phone
at Nyinaku’s office and declined to give his name.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
