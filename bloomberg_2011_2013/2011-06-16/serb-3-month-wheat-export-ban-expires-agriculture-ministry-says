The Serbian government won’t extend
a three-month ban on wheat and flour exports that expires today,
an  Agriculture Ministry  official said today.  “The ban expires today as it was only a temporary
measure,” Goran Djakovic, an adviser to the agriculture
minister, said in an interview. No other new restrictions are
planned, he said.  The government introduced the ban on March 17, after three-
month exports exceeded plans and threatened to turn Serbia into
a wheat importer. The measure was also aimed at  imposing
controls over food prices, largely blamed for Serbia’s double-
digit inflation. Annual price growth slowed to 13.4 percent in
May from 14.7 percent in April.  The share of wheat and other grains was around 5 percent of
total exports in 2009 and 2010. Agriculture generates a quarter
of  Serbia ’s exports.  The ban expired weeks before Serbian farmers harvest new
wheat. The central bank hopes for a better agricultural season
to ease pressure on food prices.  Wheat prices rose 6.9 percent this week so far to trade at
27.22 dinars per kilogram today, or the equivalent of 269.5
euros per ton at the Novi Sad Commodity Exchange.  “Global, regional and even developments at the Novi Sad
Stock Exchange, definitely prove that we are in a year of
expensive food,” the bourse based in the capital of Serbia’s
bread-basket Vojvodina, said in weekly market comments posted on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
