Germany  will drop a solar subsidy
cut planned for July because of weak demand for photovoltaic
panels, the Financial Times Deutschland reported today, citing
an interview with a government official.  Based on installations this spring, the government expects
2,800 megawatts of solar panels to be added this year, compared
with the full-year target of 3,500 megawatts, Katherina Reiche,
a state secretary in the Environment Ministry, said in the
report.  "That’s why there won’t be a reduction of the feed-in-
tariff in July,’’ Reiche told the newspaper.  Germany,  Europe ’s biggest electricity market, led the world
in 2010 by adding 7,450 megawatts of solar power, as developers
were spurred by its subsidized rate for clean energy know as a
feed-in-tariff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
