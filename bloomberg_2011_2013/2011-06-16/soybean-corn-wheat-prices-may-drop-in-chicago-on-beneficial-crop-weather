What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 12 cents to 14 cents a bushel lower
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade as warm, wet weather aids early
U.S. crop development, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open 0.6 cent to 0.7 cent a pound lower,
and soybean-meal futures may open down $3 to $4 for 2,000
pounds.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago on speculation that beneficial weather forecast
for the next two weeks in the Midwest will boost crop prospects,
Schultz said.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as dry weather aids U.S. harvesting of winter
grain and rain boosts development of spring crops in Russia,
Ukraine and other parts of  Europe , Schultz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
