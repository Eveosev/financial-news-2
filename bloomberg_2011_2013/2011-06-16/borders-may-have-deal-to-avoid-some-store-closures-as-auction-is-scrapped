Borders Group Inc., the bankrupt
bookstore chain, said it may have a deal with lenders and
creditors to avoid closing as many as 51 stores, and it canceled
an auction scheduled for today, according to a bankruptcy court
filing.  Borders has held extensive negotiations with its lenders
and the committee of unsecured creditors about an amendment to
its financing that would avoid closing the stores, according to
filings yesterday and June 8.  “The debtors believe that the parties have reached an
agreement in principle, subject to documentation, and hope to
finalize an agreement, subject to court approval, in the very
near term,” yesterday’s filing said.  Mary Davis , a Borders spokeswoman, declined to comment.  Borders said June 9 it would close 51 stores. The company,
the second-largest book chain after Barnes & Noble Inc., had 642
stores in February when it filed for court protection and, after
closing 237 of them, has 405 still operating. Under Chapter 11
of the  bankruptcy code , the company would hold an auction to
sell itself and find the best deal to repay its creditors.  The case is In re Borders Group Inc., 11-10614,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
