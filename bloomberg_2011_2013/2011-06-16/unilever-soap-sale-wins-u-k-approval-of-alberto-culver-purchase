Unilever’s offer to sell its newly
acquired bar-soap business to win U.K. competition approval for
its $3.7 billion takeover of  Alberto-Culver Co. (ACV)  was accepted by
Britain’s antitrust regulator.  The Dutch manufacturer will sell Alberto-Culver’s bar soaps
unit, including the Cidal and Wright’s products, to a brand-
acquisition company called Lornamead, the U.K. Office of Fair
Trading said today in a statement. Unilever made the divestment
offer in March.  “We are satisfied that this divestment will ensure there
continues to be effective competition in this market,” Ali
Nikpay, a senior director at the OFT , said in the statement.  The takeover, which avoided a referral to the U.K.’s
Competition Commission, will be Unilever’s biggest purchase in a
decade. It’s part of the Rotterdam- and London-based company’s
effort to double sales by expanding its range of products. The
OFT initially said the deal could hurt consumers by reducing
competition for Unilever’s Dove brand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
