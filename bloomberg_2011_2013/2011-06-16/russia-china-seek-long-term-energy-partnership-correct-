(Corrects location of statement in second paragraph.)  Russia and China are seeking to form
a “long-term” energy partnership as they pursue bilateral
trade of $200 billion a year by 2020, according to a joint
statement by Presidents  Dmitry Medvedev  and  Hu Jintao .  The two countries are seeking to form “strategic long-term
relations in energy,” including oil, natural gas, coal and
electricity, according to the statement, released today in
Moscow.  Deals signed today include a $5 billion agreement between
Russia’s EN+ and China’s Import Export Bank to finance energy
projects such as coal production in east Siberia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
