South Korea’s won fell to a three-
week low as  Europe ’s deepening debt crisis cooled demand for
emerging-market assets.  Government bonds  gained.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will reshuffle his
Cabinet and seek a confidence vote today, battling to control a
shrinking majority and push through austerity measures demanded
by international lenders. The political turmoil came as European
Union talks on forging a new bailout to prevent the first euro-
area default stalled.  “Investors are concerned about the Greek debt crisis which
doesn’t seem like it’ll be resolved any time soon,” said Han
Sung Min, currency dealer at Busan Bank in  Seoul . “That’s
prompting investors to favor safer assets and dump riskier
assets, including the won.”  The won dropped 0.6 percent to close at 1,089.73 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,091.53,
the weakest level since May 26.  Five-year bonds advanced for the first time in three days.
The yield on  South Korea ’s 4 percent notes due March 2016
dropped nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.88
percent, according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc. That was
the biggest drop in the yield since June 2.  A government report showed sales at major South Korean
department stores expanded at the slowest pace in three months
in May, rising 8.7 percent, as frequent rain and cool weather
damped demand for summer clothes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
