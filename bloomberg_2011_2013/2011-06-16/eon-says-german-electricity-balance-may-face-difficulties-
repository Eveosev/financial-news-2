EON AG,  Germany ’s biggest utility,
said the forced March halt of the country’s seven oldest nuclear
reactors may lead to strains in the balance of supply and demand
in Europe’s biggest power market in the next quarter.  “A warm summer, little water, no wind, a lot of sun,”
Jorgen Kildahl, EON’s board member responsible for generation
and trading, said yesterday in an interview in  London . “Yes,
you can actually foresee scenarios when it could be difficult.”  Seven of Germany’s oldest reactors were shut in the second
half of March after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  ordered the
halts following the nuclear disaster in  Japan . That removed more
than 25 percent of the country’s nuclear power capacity.  “It’s a complex analysis to do, but you could see
scenarios that could be strained, no doubt about that,” Kildahl
said. “We had one in 2003 and it was a very, very hot summer
and then we didn’t have the current issues ongoing.”  Temperatures will be warmer than average in July and August
across Northern and Southern  Europe , forecaster WSI Corp. in
Andover,  Massachusetts  said on May 23. Next-quarter power fell
0.3 percent today to trade at 56.80 euros ($80.32) a megawatt
hour, according to broker prices on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
