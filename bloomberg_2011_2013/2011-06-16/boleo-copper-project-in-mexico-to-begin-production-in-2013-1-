Korea Resources Corp., a state-owned
minerals explorer, said its Boleo copper project in Mexico will
begin production in 2013, supplying  South Korea  with about 30
percent of the mine’s output.  The mine on Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula is expected
to produce 38,000 metric tons of copper annually for 23 years
starting in the second half of 2013, the Seoul-based company,
which owns 10 percent of the project, said in an e-mailed
statement today. South Korea will import about 12,000 tons
anually from the project, it said.  Canada’s  Baja Mining Corp. (BAJ)  holds 70 percent of the mine,
while the Korean group including Korea Resources, LS-Nikko
Copper Inc., steelmaker  Hyundai Hysco (010520)  and trader SK Networks Co.
own a combined 30 percent, the statement said.  South Korea is Asia’s third-biggest user of refined copper
after China and  Japan , according to figures by London-based
metals research company CRU. Last year, Korea consumed about
940,000 tons of the metal used in wires, pipes and cables, Korea
Resources said.  Copper on the London Metal Exchange has jumped about 36
percent in the past year as supply trails demand, reaching a
record $10,190 a ton in February. The metal for three-month
delivery fell 0.6 percent to $9,097 a ton at 5:36 p.m.  Seoul 
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
