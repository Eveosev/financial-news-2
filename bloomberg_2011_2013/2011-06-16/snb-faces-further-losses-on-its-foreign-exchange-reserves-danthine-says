Switzerland ’s central bank may face
further losses on its foreign-exchange reserves,  Swiss National
Bank  governing board member Jean-Pierre Danthine said.  The SNB’s foreign-currency holdings, built up last year as
it tried to contain the Swiss franc’s gains, cause “increased
financial risk” and “hold the potential for further losses,”
Danthine said today in a speech in the Swiss capital, Bern.  The Swiss currency has gained 16 percent against the euro
since April 29, when the SNB reported a profit of 1.86 billion
francs ($2.2 billion) in the first quarter. That followed a loss
of 19.2 billion francs in 2010, the biggest in the Zurich-based
central bank’s 103-year history, as it bought euros and dollars
to keep a lid on the franc.  “Selling our foreign-exchange reserves (and buying Swiss
francs) is not an option at the moment,” Danthine said. “The
only option for the SNB is therefore to diversify its risks.”  The central bank’s reserves include as much as 10 percent
in equities and 5 percent in corporate bonds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
