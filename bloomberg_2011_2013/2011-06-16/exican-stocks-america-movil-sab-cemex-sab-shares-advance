controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , gained for a fourth day,
rising 0.3 percent to 29.63 pesos. America Movil bought back
shares at a daily average of 25.8 million during the three
sessions before today, up from a year-to-date average of 5.5

Americas, advanced 1.7 percent to 9.36 pesos. Work began on
560,000 houses at an annual pace, up 3.5 percent from the prior

increased. Cemex gets about 18 percent of its revenue from the
U.S. and 24 percent from  Mexico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
