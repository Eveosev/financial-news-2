Joe Torre  and Bernie Williams, the
manager and center fielder on four World Series championship
teams for the  New York Yankees  before leaving the club under
strained circumstances, will take part in their first Old-
Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium this month.  More than 50 former Yankees are set to participate in the
June 26 event, the Major League Baseball franchise said today in
an e-mailed statement. The day will include a ceremony and a
short old-timers’ game before the Yankees meet the  Colorado
Rockies .  Torre, 70, managed the Yankees from 1996 to 2007, winning
World Series titles in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The American
League Manager of the Year in 1996 and 1998, Torre made the
playoffs in all 12 seasons on the Yankees’ bench.  A former player and manager with the  New York Mets , Torre
left the Yankees in 2007 after rejecting a one-year, $5 million
offer, which he called insulting. A 2009 book about Torre’s
tenure with the team made references to teammates calling third
baseman  Alex Rodriguez , “A-Fraud,” and detailed a tenuous
relationship between Torre and the team’s front office,
including General Manager Brian Cashman and President Randy Levine.  Torre managed the  Los Angeles Dodgers  for three seasons and
is now MLB’s executive vice president of baseball operations.  Williams, 42, batted .297 with 287 home runs in his 16-year
career, spent entirely with the Yankees. A five-time All-Star
and four-time Gold Glove Award winner, he led the AL with a .339
batting average in 1998.  Williams ended his playing career after rejecting the
Yankees’ offer of a minor-league contract and an invitation to
spring training to try to make the major-league club in 2007.  Others scheduled to take part in the day include Hall of
Fame players  Yogi Berra , Rich “Goose” Gossage, Reggie Jackson,
and Whitey Ford, according to the statement. The team also will
hold a special tribute to trainer Gene Monahan, who is retiring
after 49 years with the organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
