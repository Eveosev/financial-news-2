Brazilian homebuilder  Brookfield
Incorporacoes SA (BISA3)  fell as concern interest rates will rise more
than previously estimated overshadowed the government’s plan to
boost spending on its low-income housing program.  Brookfield,  Brazil ’s fourth-largest real-estate company by
revenue, dropped 1.8 percent to 7.64 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo at 4:15 p.m. New York time. The stock had
gained as much as 2.7 percent earlier, leading an industry rally
that sputtered as traders pushed up yields on interest-rate
futures. The yield on the contracts due in January 2013 climbed
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.47 percent,
hurting the outlook for domestic demand.  Brazil will spend 125.7 billion reais ($78.4 billion)
through 2014 on the second phase of the low-income housing
program known as “My House, My Life,” building 2 million
homes, the government said in a report distributed today in
Brasilia. The details were already expected by the market, said
Armando Halfeld, a real-estate analyst at Rio de Janeiro-based
brokerage Ativa Corretora.  “I didn’t see anything surprising,” he said. “The sector
is lagging on macro questions.”  The initial phase of the government’s program, which began
in 2009, called for 1 million homes to be built. Homebuilders
had gained earlier as its continuation indicated “the
government is committed to keeping the program rolling,”
Halfeld said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
