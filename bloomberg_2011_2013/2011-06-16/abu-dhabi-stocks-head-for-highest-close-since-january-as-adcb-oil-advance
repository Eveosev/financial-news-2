Abu Dhabi’s benchmark index climbed
to the highest level in more than five months, led by Abu Dhabi
Commercial Bank and higher  oil prices .  ADCB surged to the highest in more than two years after the
Star reported the emirate’s second-biggest bank by assets may be
selling its stake in Malaysia’s RHB Capital Bhd. for 10.80
ringgit a share (13 dirhams). First Gulf Bank PJSC rose for a
second day. The benchmark  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  advanced 0.7 percent
to 2,761.48, the highest since Jan. 9 at the 2:00 p.m. close in
the emirate, extending its gain this week to 2.2 percent. The
 Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) , which tracks the top 200 companies in
the  Persian Gulf , fell 0.2 percent.  The market is buoyed by “news that ADCB is selling its
stake in RHB at around 13 dirhams a share, which is 2 dirhams
higher than we expected,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu
Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “The market is holding steady
after a big run up in prices,” he said, referring to a gain of
1.2 percent yesterday. Oil is also helping, he said.  Abu Dhabi  holds about 7 percent of the world’s proven oil
reserves. Oil prices gained as much as 1 percent to $95.75 a
barrel in  New York . Shares in the  United Arab Emirates  advanced
yesterday on optimism the country will secure an upgrade to
emerging markets at index provider MSCI Inc.  RHB Stake Sale  ADCB gained 2.2 percent to 3.23 dirhams, the highest close
since October 2008, after the Star quoted an unidentified person
as saying the lender is selling its 25 percent stake in RHB to
Aabar Investments PJSC at 2.25 times book value. An ADCB
spokesman, who didn’t want to be identified in line with company
policy, declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.
First Gulf Bank climbed 1.7 percent to 18.05 dirhams.  “Investors are cautiously optimistic about better second-
quarter earnings, particularly banks and some real-estate
companies,” Farhat said.  Sorouh may report a profit of 106.5 million dirhams in the
second quarter after 30.8 million dirhams a year earlier,
according to the average of two estimates on Bloomberg. The
shares rose 0.7 percent to 1.36 dirhams.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  and Bahrain’s BB All Share Index
fell less than 0.1 percent. Qatar’s measure retreated 0.8
percent, Oman’s benchmark declined 0.5 percent and Kuwait’s
gauge lost 0.1 percent. Saudi Arabia’s market was closed for the
weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
