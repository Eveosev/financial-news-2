Longman Nigeria Plc (LONGMAN) , which publishes
and markets educational materials, fell to the lowest in 10
months after saying its foreign partner,  Pearson Plc (PSON) , plans to
sell its 51 percent stake in the company.  The stock lost 33 kobo, or the maximum daily limit of 5
percent, to 6.27 naira by 1:32 p.m. in Lagos, the lowest level
since August 2010.  Pearson will sell its stake over a period of 18 months
beginning this month, Longman Nigeria’s Chairman Emmanuel
Ijewere said in statement published in the Punch newspaper
yesterday.  “Pearson has contributed to the stability of Longman
Nigeria,” Eugene Ezenwa, chief operating officer of Sterling
Stockbrokers Ltd., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone today.
“Now that the foreign partners are leaving, this could lead to
some investors losing confidence in the company and shareholders
might want to sell.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
