First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , which
plans to build the $1 billion Trident copper mine in  Zambia ,
expects regulators in the southern African country to approve
its environmental impact study “soon,” a company official said.  A decision may come after the environmental authority
completes a transition, Tristan Pascall, project coordinator at
the company, said in an interview yesterday on the sidelines of
a mining conference in Lusaka, the capital. Last year, Zambia’s
government introduced  legislation  giving the regulator increased
authority and changing its name to the Zambia Environmental
Management Agency, or ZEMA, from the Environmental Council of
Zambia, or ECZ.  “First Quantum feels confident that the transition from the
old ECZ to the new ZEMA will occur in a timely manner so as not
to impact on the development schedules of the pipeline of
development projects currently being executed in Zambia,”
Pascall said.  The Trident project involves the development of three open-
pit mines, a smelter and an airstrip at Kalumbila, in Zambia’s
so-called copperbelt, the richest source of the metal in the
country, which is  Africa ’s largest producer. Trident may create
2,000 jobs, Chairman Philip Pascal said in April.  First Quantum, based in  Vancouver , on May 28 told Zambia’s
closely held Post newspaper it hadn’t started mining at
Kalumbila because it hadn’t been given approval by the ECZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
