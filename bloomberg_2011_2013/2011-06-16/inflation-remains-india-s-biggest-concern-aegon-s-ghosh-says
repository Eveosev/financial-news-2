Saibal Ghosh, chief investment
officer at Aegon Religare Life Insurance Co., comments on the
outlook for Indian equities. Ghosh spoke in a phone interview
from Mumbai today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
103.97, or 0.6 percent, to 18,028.27 at 1:02 p.m. in Mumbai.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
7.50 percent from 7.25 percent, according to an e-mailed
statement today. Nineteen of 20 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey predicted the decision, while one expected no change.  On  interest rates :  “The rate hike is expected but more importantly is that
uncertainty in policy still remains high as inflation is the
biggest concern. We can see further rate hikes unless we see
global commodity and energy prices moderate significantly from
current levels.”  Advice to investors:  “The long term looks good. So if some investors are
already invested then they should stay invested but if some are
planning to put money in now, they should wait because the
market will definitely not go anywhere in a big way in the next
one to two months.”  Ghosh recommends fast-moving  consumer goods  and
pharmaceutical stocks and advises against banking and real-
estate shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
