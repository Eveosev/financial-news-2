The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the
way for two West Virginians to seek class-action status in a
suit against a  Bayer AG (BAYN)  unit over its withdrawn cholesterol drug
Baycol.  The justices today unanimously overturned a decision that
said the pair was bound by a ruling rejecting a West Virginia
class-action bid in an earlier Baycol suit.  Keith Smith and Shirley Sperlazza are seeking to sue Bayer
Corp. on behalf of all West Virginians who took Baycol. They
said they shouldn’t be bound by the earlier ruling because they
weren’t involved in that case.  Bayer said in a statement that it “will continue to defend
this case, including on the issue of class certification, should
it move forward at the state level.”  Bayer withdrew Baycol from the market in August 2001. The
U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  said Baycol was linked to
rhabdomyolysis, a sometimes-fatal muscle breakdown disorder.  The case is Smith v. Bayer, 09-1205.  To contact the reporter on this story:
