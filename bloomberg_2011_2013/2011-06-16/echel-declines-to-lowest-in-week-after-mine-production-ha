OAO Mechel dropped to its lowest
level in a week after the Russian coal and steel producer
yesterday reported the temporary halt of operations at its
Sibirginskaya mine.  The shares fell 1.3 percent to 737 rubles by 11:02 a.m. in
Moscow, its lowest intraday level since June 9.  The company said a “heightened level” of fire gases was
detected, prompting the suspension of operations at the site
owned by Southern Kuzbass Coal Co., part of Mechel, according to
a regulatory statement.  The closure may lead to a “3 percent hit” to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,  Luis
Saenz , the London-based director of international sales at
brokerage Otkritie Securities Ltd. said in e-mailed comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
