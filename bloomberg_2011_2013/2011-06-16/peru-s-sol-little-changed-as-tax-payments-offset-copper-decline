Peru’s sol was little changed as
exporters paying domestic taxes offset a decline in prices for
the country’s copper amid concern  Greece ’s debt crisis may damp
global growth and curb demand for industrial metals.  The sol traded at 2.7625 per U.S. dollar at 2:29 p.m. New
York time, from 2.7623 yesterday.  Peruvian companies are buying soles to pay income taxes
before a monthly deadline expires June 24, said  Mario Guerrero ,
an economist at Scotiabank Peru.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.48 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
