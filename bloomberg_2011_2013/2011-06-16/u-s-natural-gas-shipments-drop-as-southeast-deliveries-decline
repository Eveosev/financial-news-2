Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators declined for a second day as
shipments to the Southeast dropped.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 1 percent to 17 million
dekatherms (16.6 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in the Southeast
fell 9.5 percent to 3.45 million dekatherms.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 17 percent to
22.5 million dekatherms.  Wholesale gas at the Sonat-T1 hub, where gas is delivered
from Texas and Louisiana to the Southeast, climbed 7.93 cents,
or 1.8 percent, to $4.575 per million British thermal units on
the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
rose 2.77 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $4.5525 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
