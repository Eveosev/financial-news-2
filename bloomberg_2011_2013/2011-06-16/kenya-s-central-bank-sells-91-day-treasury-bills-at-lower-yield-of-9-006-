Kenya ’s three-month borrowing costs
fell for the first time since February at a central bank auction
where demand was more than six times the amount on offer.  The yield on 91-day Treasury bills fell to 9.006 percent
from 9.016 percent on June 9, the Central Bank of Kenya said in
an e-mailed statement today. The last time the rate dropped was
at a sale on Feb. 17. Since then, yields have surged more than 6
percentage points from 2.592 percent, according to the central
bank’s website.  The bank, which had offered 2 billion shillings ($22.2
million) of the debt, received 13.7 billion shillings of bids
and accepted 6.7 billion shillings at today’s sale.  “The central bank is determined to cap the yield below
double digits as such a rise will have implications on the short
end of the yield curve, potentially eroding gains on the
benchmark two-year Treasury bonds,” Ann Musyoka, a fixed-income
trader at Tsavo Securities Ltd., said in a phone interview.  Faster inflation and persistent fiscal deficits have pushed
up borrowing costs in Kenya, East Africa’s biggest economy.
Price growth accelerated for the past seven months to a 25-month
high in May of 13 percent, as food and fuel prices surged.  The country’s budget gap has widened every year since at
least 2005, the  International Monetary Fund  said in April, with
the overall debt rising to 48 percent of GDP from 39 percent in
2007-2008, according to the government.  Spending Boost  Kenya will boost spending by 15 percent to 1.15 trillion
shillings in the year through June 2012, increasing expenditure
on roads and energy, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said in his
budget speech on June 8. The  budget deficit  will widen to 8.8
percent of gross domestic project excluding grants in the year
through June 2012, Henry Rotich, the Treasury’s deputy director
of economic affairs, said today.  “Our debt sustainability plan shows it’s still in a
manageable position,” Geoffrey Mwau, economic secretary in the
 Finance Ministry , said by phone yesterday.  Kenya’s central bank may raise its benchmark rate as much
as 1.25 percentage points by the end of the year to curb
inflation and support the shilling, which hit the weakest in 17
years on June 13,  Renaissance Capital  said.  The country’s monetary policy committee last month raised
the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 6.25 percent
and the  cash reserve ratio  by the same amount to 4.75 percent.  Six-month debt yields fell to 9.906 percent at an auction
yesterday, from 9.949 percent at a previous sale. The rate is
within four basis points of a nine-year high.  To contact the reporters on this story:
