Five-time Wimbledon champion  Venus Williams ’ comeback to professional tennis in Eastbourne,
England, was ended by Daniela Hantuchova in the quarterfinals.  Hantuchova of Slovakia beat the American, playing in her
first event after a five-month injury lay-off, 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 at
the Aegon International grass-court tournament on England’s
south coast.  Yesterday, Venus’ younger sister and defending Wimbledon
champion  Serena Williams  lost in three sets to second-ranked
Vera Zvonareva. It was Serena’s first event since she won her
fourth Wimbledon title against Zvonareva almost a year ago and
then got sidelined by a foot injury and treatment for blood
clots in both lungs.  Wimbledon starts June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
