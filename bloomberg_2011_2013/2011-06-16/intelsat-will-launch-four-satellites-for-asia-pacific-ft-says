Intelsat SA, the world’s biggest
commercial satellite operator, plans to invest $1.3 billion in
four communications satellite launches in the next 18 months, to
serve the Asia-Pacific region, the Financial Times reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Dave McGlade.  The plan, which McGlade will announce today, is in response
to demand in the region’s rapidly growing economies for pay-
television, broadband access and mobile communications, the
newspaper said.  McGlade said Intelsat has presold much of the new capacity
to customers that include Tata Communications Ltd. and Sony
Pictures Television, the FT reported.  Intelsat is owned by a private-equity group including BC
Partners Ltd. and Silverlake Partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
