Calisolar Inc. was awarded a $275
million conditional loan guarantee by the U.S. Energy Department
to build a factory that produces silicon for solar cells at half
the cost of existing production facilities.  The plant will be able to produce 16,000 metric tons of
silicon a year, the agency said today in a statement. Calisolar,
of Sunnyvale,  California , will build it in three phases, each
with production capacity of 5,333 tons, at a former  General
Motors Co. (GM)  facility in Ontario, Ohio.  Calisolar’s low-cost manufacturing process “offers
significant competitive advantages that will help the U.S. to
out-innovate and out-compete our global competitors,” Energy
Secretary Steven Chu said in the statement. The company also
makes solar cells.  The Energy Department has issued loans, guarantees and
conditional loan guarantees totaling more than $33 billion to
support 34 clean energy projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
