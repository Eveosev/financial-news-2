Strauss Group Ltd. (STRS)  headed for the
lowest close since November 2009 after Israeli Interior Minister
Eli Yishai asked the attorney general to open a probe into
possible price fixing of  milk products .  Yishaiâ€™s decision followed comments by Finance Minister
Yuval Steinitz yesterday who said he may allow the import of
more dairy products to boost competition in the market.  Strauss fell 3 percent to 50.13 shekels at 2:48 p.m. in Tel
Aviv, bringing the two-day decline to 4.5 percent, the biggest
such drop in a month.  Consumer prices rose in May as fuel and food prices
climbed, the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics said,
adding further pressure to the dairy market. A fifth of Strauss
revenue in 2010 came from sales of dairy products, according to
Bloomberg data.  Strauss shares are underperforming the benchmark TA-25
index, falling 6 percent in the past 12 months, while the index
rose 8 percent. Its Israeli peer,  Osem Investments Ltd. (OSEM) , dropped
1.9 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
