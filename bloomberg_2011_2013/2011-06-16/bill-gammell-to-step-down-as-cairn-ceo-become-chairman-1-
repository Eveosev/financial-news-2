Bill Gammell will step down as chief
executive officer of  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  at the end of this month
to become non-executive chairman.  Simon Thomson, currently legal and commercial director at
the company, will become CEO. Mike Watts will continue as deputy
chief executive and Jann Brown will become managing director,
reporting to Thomson, Cairn said in a statement in  London  today.  Gammell, a former international rugby player for Scotland,
led the company as it discovered oil and gas in India, building
up to the proposed sale of the majority of its India business
for $9.4 billion to  Vedanta Resources Plc. (VED)  Under Watts, who
leads Cairn’s exploration team, the company is now focusing on
finding oil in the Arctic waters off the coast of Greenland.  “Bill will now become the roving ambassador for Cairn
rather than a day-to-day executive,” said  Richard Rose , an
analyst at Oriel Securities Ltd. in London. “Simon’s a strong
individual and he’ll make a good CEO. Mike’s the driving force
on exploration and I don’t think there will be a change in
strategy.”  Malcolm Thoms, chief operating officer, and Philip Tracy,
group engineering and operations director, will step down from
the board, as will current chairman Norman Murray. The changes
take effect on July 1, Cairn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
