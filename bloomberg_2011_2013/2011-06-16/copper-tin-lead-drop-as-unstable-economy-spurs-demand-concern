Copper declined for a second day in
London on concern about the stability of the global economy as
 China  may extend credit tightening measures,  Europe ’s debt
crisis remains unresolved and the U.S. shows signs of slowing.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell as
much as 1.1 percent to $9,058 a metric ton, and traded at $9,070
by 2:54 p.m. in  Singapore . All six LME metals dropped as the
Economic Information Daily said in a front-page editorial that
an interest rate increase by China isn’t “far away”.  “Demand is not great but it is steady,” Ren An, an
analyst at China International Futures Co., said from Wuxi.
“We’ll have to see if that’s enough to withstand the pressures
from the macro-economic environment, which is filled with
uncertainty at the moment.”  China announced a half percentage point boost in the
reserve requirement ratio for banks on June 14, adding to its 11
reserve-requirement and four interest-rate increases since early
2010 to cool inflation, which climbed to 5.5 percent in May, the
fastest pace in almost three years.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  may be forced out of
office amid escalating protests over budget cuts, as European
Union failed to reach an agreement on a new bailout to prevent
the first euro-area default, sparking a global rout in equities
and sending the euro to a three-week low against the dollar.  In the U.S., industrial production trailed estimates and
manufacturers in the New York region unexpectedly turned
pessimistic in June. China and the U.S. are the world’s largest
users of copper.  China Aluminum  Aluminum prices in China have moved into so-called
backwardation, where near-term supplies are more expensive than
longer-dated contracts, a sign demand may be improving or supply
may be tightening. Prices in Changjiang,  Shanghai ’s biggest cash
market, traded around 17,070 yuan ($2,632) a ton today, while
futures were at 16,975 yuan.  “Physical sellers are unwilling to let go below 17,000
yuan but it’s too soon to draw the conclusion that Chinese
demand is so strong that the market is pricing in a shortage,”
Zhang Yan, a trader at Jin Yuan Futures Co., said from Shanghai.
“We’ll have to wait a few days to see if the backwardation
persists as it could just have to do with the contract expiry.”  China’s output of aluminum products jumped 34 percent from
a year ago to 2.45 million tons in May, the statistics bureau
said on June 14. It climbed from 2.43 million tons in April.  Aluminum in  London  fell 1 percent to $2,565 a ton, zinc
lost 0.6 percent to $2,232 a ton and lead shed 1.1 percent to
$2,490.25 a ton. Nickel decreased 0.8 percent to $21,850 a ton
and tin dropped 1.4 percent to $24,800 a ton.  To contact the reporter for this story:
