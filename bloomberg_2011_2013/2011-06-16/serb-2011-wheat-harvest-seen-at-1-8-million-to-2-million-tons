Serbia  should harvest at least 1.8
million tons of wheat this year, with the price of new grain
likely to be at least 25 percent cheaper in local markets one
month from now, the head of the Serbian Grains Fund said.  “The harvest is only 15 to 20 days away and it will
apparently be a lot better than last year,” Vukosav Sakovic
of Zita Srbije said in a phone interview today. Seeds look
much better and we expect higher yields. We can probably
expect to harvest between 1.8 million and 2.0 million tons of
wheat.”  According to official statistics, Serbia harvested 1.63
million tons of wheat in 2010, with average yields of 3.36
tons per hectare.  The landlocked Balkan nation of 7.5 million people
typically consumes 1.6 million tons of wheat a year. The new
harvest, coupled with 300,000 tons of the stockpiled
commodity, means a “plentiful” surplus for exports, Sakovic
said.  A three-month ban on wheat and flour exports expired
today and the government plans no further trade restrictions.  “Wheat is no longer that attractive as  Russia  is lifting
its own export ban,” said Sakovic. “Also, there is no longer
fear that we can export enormous quantities because buyers are
again selective about quality.”  The better harvest and the expired export ban are
expected to bring about lower domestic prices, which rose 6.9
percent this week for the last year’s crop to trade at 27.22
dinars per kilogram today, or the equivalent of 269.5 euros
per ton at the Novi Sad Commodity Exchange.  “While much depends on global prices, the starting price
of new crop in Serbia is likely to range between 18 dinars and
20 dinars per kilogram of new wheat,” Sakovic said.  Wheat and other grains, mainly corn, generate around 5
percent of Serbia’s annual exports, while the whole
agriculture accounts for 11 percent of the nation’s economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
