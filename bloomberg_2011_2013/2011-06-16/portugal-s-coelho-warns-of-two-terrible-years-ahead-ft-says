Portugal ’s incoming Social Democrat
Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said the country faces two
“terrible years” of recession and joblessness, with a return
to growth only possible if it follows “a very rigorous program
of austerity and structural reforms,” the FT reported, citing
an interview. The austerity and reform plan “cannot fail” as
failure would mean Portugal is unable to return to the financial
markets in 2013, Coelho said, according to the FT.  Coelho plans to speed up the rate at which Portugal sells
off its state-owned companies, such as the broadcasting media
and up to 49 percent of the water utilities, the FT said, citing
the interview. Coelho said he is aiming to meet deficit-
reduction targets early, the FT also reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
