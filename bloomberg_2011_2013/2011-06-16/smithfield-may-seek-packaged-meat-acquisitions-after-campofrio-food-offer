Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , the world’s
largest pork processor, may seek acquisitions in the packaged-
meats industry after canceling plans to buy the remaining shares
of  Spain ’s Campofrio Food Group SA earlier this month.  “We would be interested and routinely look at potential
opportunities to do something particularly on the packaged-meats
side,” C. Larry Pope, Smithfield’s chief executive officer,
said in a telephone interview today.  “We would look at something if it made sense,” Pope said.
“The fact that we backed away from Campofrio, that has a lot of
potential, should give you comfort we are not going to do
something silly.”  Smithfield said today it will spend as much as $150 million
buying back shares over 24 months. That shows the Smithfield,
Virginia-based company isn’t interested in issuing equity to
fund any potential acquisitions at the current share price
level, Pope said.  Shares of Smithfield rose $1.14, or 5.6 percent, to $21.53
as of 12:30 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The company said earlier today fiscal fourth-quarter profit was
85 cents a share on an adjusted basis. The average of 12
analysts’ estimated compiled by Bloomberg was for earnings of 82
cents.  Smithfield, which has a 37 percent stake in Campofrio, said
in a June 2 letter to the Spanish company that it dropped talks
to purchase the remaining shares due to “adverse” economic
conditions in  Europe  and the recent decline in its stock price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
