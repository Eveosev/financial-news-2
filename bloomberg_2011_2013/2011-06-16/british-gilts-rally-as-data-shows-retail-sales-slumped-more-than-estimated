The pound dropped against the dollar
and euro after data showed U.K. retail sales slumped more than
economists forecast in May, restrained by higher fuel costs and
concern over job losses.  Sterling fell 0.4 percent to $1.6127 as of 9:32 a.m. in
 London  and slipped 0.2 percent to 87.73 pence per euro.  U.K. government bonds advanced, pushing the 10-year yield
two basis points lower to 3.22 percent. The two-year note yield
also declined two basis points to 0.77 percent.  Short-sterling futures rose, signaling traders were cutting
bets on an increase in U.K. borrowing costs. The implied yield
on the June 2012 contract fell four basis points to 1.17
percent.  Retail sales fell 1.4 percent from April, when they rose
1.1 percent on warm weather and an extra public holiday,
according to the  Office for National Statistics . The median
forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.6
percent decline.  Investors pushed back bets on the month that the central
bank will next increase rates beyond May of next year, forward
contracts on the sterling overnight interbank average show. As
recently as February, traders were betting on an increase as
soon as May of this year, data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
