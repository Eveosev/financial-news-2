Georgian lawmakers may impose
restrictions on public protests after two people were killed at
an anti-government rally last month.  Legal changes under discussion include setting out rules
for organizing protests, restricting rallies from encroaching on
government buildings, preventing small demonstrations from
blocking roads and prohibiting possession of dangerous objects
and the consumption of alcohol, Akaki Minashvili,  chairman of
the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs , said by phone in
Tbilisi today.  The changes follow a May 26 rally in Tbilisi where a
demonstrator and a police officer were killed and at least 19
people were injured. They wouldnâ€™t violate the rights of
protesters and address a Constitutional Court ruling that
existing regulations governing rallies violate the constitution,
Minashvili said.  President Mikheil Saakashvili, who came to power after the
so-called Rose Revolution in 2003, has repeatedly faced
challenges from former allies calling for his resignation. In
November 2007, he declared emergency rule for nine days after a
week of demonstrations culminated in violent clashes between
police and protesters, events that were condemned by the west.  To contact the reporter on this story:
