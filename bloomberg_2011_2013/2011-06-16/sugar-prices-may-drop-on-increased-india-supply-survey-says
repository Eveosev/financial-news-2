Sugar may fall next week as output
increases in  India , the world’s second-largest producer.  Five of eight traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar in New York may fall. Three said
it will gain. Before today, futures for October delivery added
1.6 percent this week to 24.93 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S.  Four of eight respondents said refined sugar on  London ’s
NYSE Liffe will drop. Three said it may rise. One was neutral.
Futures for August delivery lost 2.5 percent this week through
yesterday.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener will narrow next
week, five respondents said. Two said it may widen, and one said
it will be little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
