Total power generation in developed
nations rose 3.7 percent last year, after sliding 3.8 percent in
2009, as demand recovered after the global recession, according
to the  International Energy Agency .  South Korea’s and Turkey’s supplies rose the most within
the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  last
year, gaining 8.7 percent and 8 percent respectively, according
to the Paris-based group’s Medium-Term Oil and Gas Markets 2011
report, published today.  Power generation remains “below pre-crisis level” in
countries including Italy, Spain and  Greece  because of slower
rates of economic recovery, the organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
