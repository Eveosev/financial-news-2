Saskatchewan farmers planted 82
percent of their crops as of June 13, trailing the five-year
average of 92 percent, the provincial government said today in a
 report  on its website. A year earlier, 73 percent was complete
because of wet weather.  West-central and northern regions of the province have
nearly completed planting, while wet weather has been “very
challenging” in the south, the Saskatchewan Ministry of
Agriculture said. About 67 percent of spring grains, 65 percent
of oilseeds and 66 percent of pulse crops are behind normal in
development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
