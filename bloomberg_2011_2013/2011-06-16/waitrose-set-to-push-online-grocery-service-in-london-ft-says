Waitrose Ltd. will announce today
that it is to begin a marketing campaign for its online grocery
service, Waitrose.com, at the end of June as it prepares to
compete with  Ocado Group Plc (OCDO)  in the London area, the Financial
Times reported, without saying where it got the information. On
July 1, an agreement between the two companies that prevented
Waitrose from expanding its online business in the area around
the U.K. capital ends, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
