Property prices in the Lithuanian
capital, Vilnius, fell 2.1 percent in the second quarter from
the previous three months, according to preliminary figures from
the nation’s  registry office .  Outside of Vilnius, real-estate prices fell 0.2 percent,
the office said today in an e-mailed statement.  Prices rose 1 percent from a year earlier in Vilnius and
increased 6 percent elsewhere, the office reported.  The Baltic nation’s property market is “stagnating” after
the global financial crisis in 2009, the registry office said in
the statement. Lithuanian real-estate prices fell an average of
13 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
