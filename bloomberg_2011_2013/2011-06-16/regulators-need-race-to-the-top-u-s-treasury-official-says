Global regulators must lead a “race
to the top” on bank capital standards and derivatives rules, a
U.S. Treasury Department official said.  “The right answer is to level the playing field up -- not
to sacrifice safety and soundness at home,”  Lael Brainard , the
Treasury’s undersecretary for international affairs, said in
testimony prepared for a hearing today before the House
Financial Services Committee.  Brainard and U.S. regulators, including Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair and Federal Reserve Board
Governor Daniel Tarullo, are testifying today as banks such as
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  push back against
proposals to raise capital standards at global banks deemed
systemically important.  “It is critical that additional capital consists first and
foremost of high quality and loss-absorbing common equity,”
Brainard said. “Common equity is the strongest defense against
financial stress. Shareholders, not taxpayers, must absorb
losses that a bank incurs.”  On wind-down plans for failing banks, Brainard said that
“we must lay a foundation for an international framework that
requires countries to adopt strong national resolution
authorities as a prerequisite for effective cross-border
resolution.”  International “convergence” is needed across derivatives
markets, Brainard said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
