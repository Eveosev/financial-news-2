The  Swiss franc  strengthened through
1.20 per euro for the first time as investors sought the safest
European assets amid mounting concern that European officials
will fail to contain Greece’s debt crisis.  The franc extended its run as the best-performing of 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg for the year to date. The
 Swiss National Bank  will keep its benchmark interest rate at
0.25 percent today, according to all 26 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said
yesterday he would call a vote of confidence in Parliament,
while Moody’s Investors Service said it may downgrade French
banks because of their investments in Greece.  “The political developments in Greece have triggered
stress across financial markets,” said  Ray Farris , chief
strategist for Asia-Pacific fixed income and global head of
foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Suisse Group AG in Singapore.
“There’s also some use of the franc as a hedge on euro-area
risk.”  The franc appreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 1.19956
against the euro, before trading 0.4 percent stronger at 1.20478
as of 7:13 a.m. in London. The currency was little changed
against the dollar at 85.31 centimes.  “The SNB, given what’s happening with the currency, will
probably go out of its way to be irrelevant,” Farris said.
“They’ll want to give the market nothing to add to the
currency’s strength.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
