Egyptian Deputy Justice Minister
Assem el-Gohary banned the two grandchildren and two daughters-
in-law of former President  Hosni Mubarak  from traveling abroad,
state-run Nile News television reported.  Egypt ’s public prosecutor ordered on May 24 that Mubarak
and his two sons, Gamal and Alaa, be tried in a criminal court
on charges of killing demonstrators and abusing public office.  Mubarak’s three-decade rule ended in February when he ceded
interim power to Egypt’s Supreme Council of the Armed Forces
after 18 days of mass protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
