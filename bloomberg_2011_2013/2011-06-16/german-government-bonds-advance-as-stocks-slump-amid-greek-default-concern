Greek  government bonds  slumped,
pushing the yield on the two-year note above 30 percent for the
first time, as Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s failure to win
support for more austerity fueled speculation of a default.  Portuguese and Irish two-year yields also climbed to the
most since the euro’s 1999 debut, while the 10-year Spanish
yield jumped to the highest since 2000 as the country’s
borrowing costs rose at a debt sale. The cost of insuring
against default on Greek, Irish and Portuguese government debt
surged to records. Papandreou will reshuffle his Cabinet and
seek a confidence vote today. German government bonds gained,
pushing the 10-year yield to a five-month low.  “The Greek drama is firmly catching everything under its
wings and there’s no way around that story,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London .
“Implementation risk is highly elevated. It’s completely risk-
off mode and for a country like Spain to come to the market in
this environment, it’s challenging.”  The yield on Greece’s two-year notes jumped 128 basis
points to 29.30 percent as of 4:35 p.m. in London, after being
as high as 30.32 percent. Ireland’s two-year yield increased 86
basis points to 12.96 percent. The Portuguese two-year yield
surged 58 basis points to 13.02 percent.  Greek government bonds have lost investors 19 percent this
year, while Portuguese debt declined 17 percent, according to
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. German debt, perceived to be
the safest in the region, returned 0.5 percent, while Treasuries
made 3.2 percent, the indexes show.  Confidence Vote  Papandreou needs a parliamentary vote on a 78 billion-euro
($110 billion) five-year package of budget cuts and asset sales
by next month to ensure the country receives a new EU aid
package to avoid the euro-area’s first default.  Standard &
Poor’s  slashed Greece’s credit earlier this week to CCC from B,
handing it the world’s lowest sovereign credit rating.  Gains by German bonds pushed the 10-year yield down by as
much as five basis points to 2.91 percent, the lowest since Jan.
11. The 3.25 percent security due July 2021 rose 0.260, or 2.60
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.795. Yields on two-year
notes fell six basis points to 1.45 percent.  Athens  Protest  More than 20,000 people protested yesterday in Athens
against wage reductions and tax increases as lawmakers debated
budget cuts and asset sales that are conditions of the new aid.
Ports, banks, hospitals and state-run companies were paralyzed
by strikes and police used tear gas to disperse crowds.  Greece ’s
unemployment rate rose to a record in the first quarter, the
 Hellenic Statistical Service  said today.  Papandreou told his party lawmakers today that his
government had a duty to push ahead with reforms.  “I ask all Greeks to reject the logic that someone else is
at fault,” he said at a meeting in Athens today. “This will
lead to inaction and to a dependence on our creditors, which we
have now. It is in our hands to decide to continue this
effort.”  Spanish 10-year bonds yielded 273 basis points more than
similar-maturity bunds, the most since Dec. 1. The spread has
widened more than 100 basis points since declining to its 2010
low on April 12. The Irish spread over bunds jumped to 864 basis
points, after reaching the most since the euro’s debut, while
 Portugal ’s securities yielded 800 points more than their German
peers for the first time, before settling at 798 basis points.  Spanish Auction  French bonds also declined relative to bunds, pushing the
spread over their German counterparts to 42 basis points, the
most since January. The yield spread between Austrian and German
10-year securities widened by four basis points to 51 basis
points, also the most in five months.  Spain sold 2.84 billion euros of bonds, missing the maximum
target. The Treasury in  Madrid  said it sold 1.51 billion euros
of 15-year bonds at an average yield of 6.027 percent, compared
with 6.068 percent on the secondary market before the sale and
5.953 percent when similar-maturity bonds were sold on Dec. 16.
 Spain  also sold 1.33 billion euros of eight-year debt at an
average yield of 5.352 percent.  “The results were merely okay, not a ringing success,”
 Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-rate strategy at Credit
Agricole CIB in London, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Credit-default swaps on Greece soared 280 basis points to
2,050, while those on Ireland rose 36 to 802 and Portugal
climbed 17 to 814, according to CMA prices. The Markit iTraxx
SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments jumped 14
basis points to a record 239.5. An increase signals worsening
perceptions of  credit quality .  To contact the reporter on this story:
