Blackstone Group LP and SEB AB will
help  Latvia  restructure state-owned mortgage lender Hipoteku un
Zemes Banka AS, which was forced to accept government aid during
the global financial crisis.  SEB Enskilda, the corporate finance arm of SEB AB, and
Blackstone Group International Partners LLP will advise Latvia’s
government on the restructuring process, the  Finance Ministry 
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Latvia turned to a group led by the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  in 2008 for a 7.5 billion-euro
($10.6 billion) bailout after rescuing Parex Banka AS, the
Baltic country’s second-biggest lender. The government also
pumped capital into Hipoteku as investors pulled money out of
emerging markets during the first global recession since World
War II.  The government plans to break up the bank and will “either
sell assets or put some non-performing assets in a workout”
sometime this year, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis said in a
May 31 interview. Latvia submitted a restructuring plan to the
EU in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
