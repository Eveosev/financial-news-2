Suntech Power Holdings, the world’s
largest maker of solar panels, rose to the highest level in more
than two weeks after  Germany  said it won’t cut aid for solar
panels in July.  The American depositary receipts of the Wuxi, China-based
company gained 2.2 percent to $7.91 at 11:25 a.m. New York time.
They earlier gained 5.7 percent to $8.18, the highest intraday
price since June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
