Germany  is easing its stance on the
timeframe for participation of private bondholders in any new
bailout plans for Greece after the  International Monetary Fund 
indicated it was ready to support the payment of the next 12
billion-euro ($17 billion) portion of Greece’s current rescue
package next month, the Financial Times said, citing unnamed
German officials. The country still insists that bondholders
must make a “substantial and quantifiable contribution,” the
FT said, citing the officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
