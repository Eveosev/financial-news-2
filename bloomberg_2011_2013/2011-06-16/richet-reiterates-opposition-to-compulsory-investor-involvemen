European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  reiterated his opposition to any Greek
bailout that forces private investors to participate.  “To embark in a compulsory way of dealing with this issue
is not advisable,” Trichet said told The  Times newspaper  in an
interview conducted on June 13, according to a transcript
published by the Frankfurt-based ECB. It’s up to governments to
deal with the problem and the ECB is “telling them that doing
anything that would create a credit event or selective default
or default is not advisable,” Trichet said.  Trichet also said a withdrawal from the euro area by  Greece ,
Portugal or Ireland “is not a working assumption that anybody
considers.”  Trichet said he has “no plan” for the time after his
eight-year term as ECB president ends on Oct. 31.  “I will see after the end of my mandate,” he said. “At
the present moment I still have close to five months ahead of me
and quite a lot of challenges obviously.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
