Carrefour SA (CA) , the world’s second-
largest retailer, named Noel Prioux executive director for
France and tasked him with turning around the unit after its
first-half results were below management expectations.  Chief Executive Officer Lars Olofsson, who took direct
control of the French business in May, will continue to oversee
the unit’s operations, the Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based
retailer said today in a statement. He has asked Prioux to
implement a recovery plan, the company said.  The grocer also named Thomas Hubner, 53, as head of  Europe ,
succeeding Prioux, who had been appointed to the role in April.
Prioux, 51, replaces James McCann, who left the company in May
after little more than a year in charge of the domestic unit,
Carrefour’s biggest.  Olofsson, who joined Carrefour in 2009 after a decade in
which sales barely rose in  France , is pinning the company’s
turnaround on a 1.5 billion-euro ($2.12 billion) revamp of 500
superstores, or hypermarkets, in western Europe. He’s betting
the new format, dubbed Carrefour Planet, with lower prices and
more own label products will boost sales and profit through
2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
