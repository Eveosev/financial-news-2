David Einhorn , the hedge-fund
manager who obtained a minority stake in the  New York Mets ,
obtained a $1 option to take control of the team in three years,
Forbes reported, citing a banker familiar with the agreement.  The agreement, which would allow Einhorn to boost his stake
from 33 percent to 60 percent, isnâ€™t final and is subject to the
approval of MLB, the magazine reported in its online edition.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
