Banks led an increase in the cost of
protecting European corporate bonds from default amid concern
 Greece  may reject austerity measures demanded for a bailout.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on the subordinated debt of 25 banks and insurers jumped 8.5
basis points to 298, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 9 a.m.
in London. Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 9 basis
points to 419.  European finance ministers this weekend failed to agree on
releasing a loan payment to spare Greece from default, saying
further aid depends on more budget cuts as the country’s
Parliament meets for a confidence vote. This added to concerns
that Irish bank senior bondholders will have to join junior
creditors in shouldering losses at two of the country’s stricken
lenders, as mooted by Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  June 15.  “There only seem to be two stories in town right now,”
CreditSights Inc. analysts led by  Simon Adamson  wrote in a note
today. “Greek sovereign debt restructuring -- or not -- and
Irish banks’ debt haircuts -- maybe.”  The  Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index  gained, rising
6.2 to 228.5. Default swaps on Greece jumped 40 basis points to
1,967 and contracts on Italian government debt climbed 12 basis
points to 182.5, the highest since March 10, according to CMA.  Moody’s Investors Service put  Italy ’s Aa2 rating on review
for possible downgrade citing “challenges” to economic growth
and the risks associated with the country reducing and funding
its debt, the ratings firm said June 17.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2.5 basis points to 113.5 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers climbed 3.25 basis points to 167.24.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
