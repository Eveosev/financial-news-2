European Union Energy Commissioner
Guenther Oettinger is seeking to force electricity providers to
cut energy use in the region by 1.5 percent annually,  Die Welt 
reported, citing the draft of a directive that Oettinger will
present on June 22 in Brussels.  The savings should be achieved by making consumers use less
electricity, Die Welt said.  The commission also wants to force companies to issue bills
to customers more frequently, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
