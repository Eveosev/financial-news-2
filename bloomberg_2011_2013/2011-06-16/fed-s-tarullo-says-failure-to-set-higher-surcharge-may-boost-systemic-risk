Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said failure to set a capital surcharge above
requirements under the Basel III agreement may expose the
financial system to excessive risk.  “What is important is not to lose sight of the costs of
not acting,” Tarullo said today in testimony to the House
Financial Services Committee. The surcharge based on some
studies may range as high as 7 percentage points above the Basel
capital requirement, Tarullo said, adding that the final figure,
now under consideration by regulators, may not be 7 percentage
points.  Tarullo said he sees a need to “calibrate” the number
based on risks of the assets held by the biggest banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
