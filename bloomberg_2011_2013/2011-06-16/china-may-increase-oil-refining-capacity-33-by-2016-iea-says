China , the world’s second-largest
oil user, may increase its refining capacity 33 percent by 2016
from this year, the  International Energy Agency  said.  A total of 3.3 million barrels a day of net crude
distillation unit capacity may be added to the 10 million
barrels a day of capacity in early 2011, the Paris-based agency
said in its medium-term oil and gas report today.  Global oil demand may rise 1.2 million barrels a day
annually through 2016, with China accounting for more than 40
percent of the increase, IEA said. China will add about 2
million barrels a day of refining capacity in the five years
through 2015, the official Xinhua News Agency said in January,
citing  Zhang Guobao , head of the National Energy Administration
at that time.  “In the end, the pace of expansion will probably depend on
oil demand growth,” IEA said. The government will control the
speed at which more domestic refinery capacity is brought on-
line to avoid surplus capacity, it said.  Both light and middle distillates, namely naphtha, gasoline,
diesel and kerosene, will remain mostly balanced by 2016, while
fuel oil imports will be steady at about 200,000 to 300,000
barrels a day currently, IEA said.  For Related News and Information:
