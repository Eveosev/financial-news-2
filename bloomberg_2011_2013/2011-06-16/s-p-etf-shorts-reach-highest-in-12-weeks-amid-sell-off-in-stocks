Investor bets against the exchange-
traded fund that invests in Standard & Poor’s 500 stocks climbed
to the highest in 12 weeks, after the benchmark equity gauge
posted its longest weekly decline since 2008.  Short positions on the  SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) , known as the
SPY, rose to 125.3 million shares on June 15, the highest level
since March 21, according to New York-based research firm Data
Explorers. Investors created new shares of the fund this week to
protect against further losses in the equity market, according
to Eric Lichtenstein of Knight Capital Group.  “As the market has sold off since the end of April, a lot
of people are using the SPY ETF to hedge their portfolios, to
mitigate some of their risk” said Lichtenstein, the  Jersey
City , New Jersey-based managing director of ETF trading at
Knight. “To satisfy this new short demand, you’re seeing the
shares outstanding increase quite substantially.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has erased 7.2 percent
since its 2011 peak of 1,363.61 on April 29, while the SPY ETF
attracted the biggest inflows in the past week and month,
according to XTF Inc. in  New York . The number of SPY shares
outstanding jumped 12 percent since June 13 to 741 million
shares as concern of a slowing economy caused investors to lose
confidence equity markets will rebound and bet against the U.S.
stock ETF.  “If you look at the marketplace, the real move has
happened in the last two weeks,” Lichtenstein said.  The benchmark equity measure has posted six straight weeks
of declines, the longest streak since 2008, falling 2.2 percent
and 2.3 percent in the last two consecutive weeks.  In March, the earthquake in  Japan  and fears of a nuclear
crisis spurred the number of short positions to climb 59 percent
over two days. Shares on loan plunged 50 percent five trading
days after. In the last four weeks, shorts have risen more than
87 percent to the current level.  “SPY is by far the largest and most liquid ETF and while
the price has declined since mid-May, the value on loan has
reached almost $15 billion,” said Will Duff Gordon, a senior
research analyst at  Data Explorers . “Many investors tend to use
ETFs as a hedge against bullish long positions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
