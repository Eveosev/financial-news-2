Airbus SAS won 102 orders for
revamped A320-family planes from Go Airlines ( India ) Ltd. and
Philippine budget carrier Cebu Pacific, moving it closer to
reaching a target of 500 commitments by the end of next week.  GoAir agreed to a deal for 72 A320neos, Managing Director
Jeh Wadia told reporters in Mumbai today. Cebu Pacific signed a
memorandum of understanding for 30 A321neos as well as
exercising options for seven existing A320s, President Lance Gokongwei said in Manila.  “We chose the neo because we felt that it’s the best
aircraft of the decade,” Wadia said. It will offer
“substantial amount of savings, especially in India where fuel
is so expensive,” he said.  Toulouse, France-based Airbus expects to have more than 500
A320neo orders by the end of the  Paris Air Show , which starts
June 20, reaching the milestone about seven months after
committing to building the plane.  Boeing Co. (BA)  also plans to
decide this year between fitting new engines to its rival 737
and developing a new single-aisle aircraft as carriers seek to
pare fuel usage amid rising oil prices.  The A320neo, due to enter service in 2015, will be 15
percent more fuel-efficient than current planes, according to
Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. It
will have a choice of engines from United Technologies Corp.’s
Pratt & Whitney and from CFM International, a venture between
 General Electric Co. (GE)  and Safran SA.  Cebu Pacific, a unit of Cebu City, the Philippines-based
 Cebu Air Inc. (CEB) , and GoAir are both existing operators of A320s.
Airbus may announce it first order from an airline flying the
Boeing 737 this month, Christopher Buckley, Airbus’s executive
vice president for  Europe ,  Asia  and Pacific, said in a June 6
interview. The planemaker had won 332 orders and commitments by
that point, he said.  IndiGo, India’s biggest budget carrier, agreed to order 150
A320neos in January as part of the world’s biggest plane deal.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Virgin America Inc. and Brazilian carrier
Tam SA have also made orders or commitments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
