Libya  won’t be able to raise oil
production to pre-conflict levels of about 1.6 million barrels a
day until 2014, according to the  International Energy Agency .  Output in the North African country has fallen to less than
200,000 barrels a day amid the uprising against leader
 Muammar Qaddafi , the Paris-based IEA said today in its Medium
Term Oil and Gas Market report.  “Libyan production capacity is assumed to recover slowly
after the ongoing civil war, regaining pre-war levels near 1.6
million barrels a day only in 2014,” according to the report.
“Hopes that a quick end to the unrest would leave the oil
sector relatively unscathed have faded now. A long, protracted
stoppage is looking increasingly likely.”  The rebel organization known as the National Transitional
Council may be able to export “some” crude in the next few
months with protection from the forces of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
