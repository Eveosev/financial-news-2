The  Boston Bruins  lead the Vancouver
Canucks 1-0 after the first period in the deciding game of the
National Hockey Leagueâ€™s Stanley Cup Final.  Patrice Bergeron  scored after 14 minutes, 37 seconds at
Rogers Arena in Vancouver.  The team that scored first won each of the previous six
games in the series. The host team has won 12 of 15 previous
Stanley Cup Final deciders.  The Canucks lost on their previous trips to the
championship series in 1982 and 1994. The Bruins have been
beaten five times in the Stanley Cup Final, most recently in
1990, since they collected the last of their five NHL titles in
1972.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
