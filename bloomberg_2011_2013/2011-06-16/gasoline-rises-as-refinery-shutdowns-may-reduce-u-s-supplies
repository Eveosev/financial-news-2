Gasoline rose as shutdowns at
refineries serving the  New York  Harbor market reduced
inventories of the motor fuel.  Futures advanced 0.9 percent as refineries in New Jersey
and  Canada  with a total capacity of about 550,000 barrels a day
had unplanned shutdowns this month. New York Harbor is the
delivery point for New York Mercantile Exchange futures.  “Prompt barrels in the Harbor are very tight,” said  Tom Knight , vice president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold
Cos. in Texarkana,  Texas .  Gasoline for July delivery gained 2.59 cents to settle at
2.9494 a gallon on the Nymex, after touching $2.9879. The
premium for July over August futures widened to 5.2 cents from
4.64 cents yesterday. It’s the widest spread between the
contracts closest to expiration since May 31.  Gasoline was the third-best performer, behind sugar and
live cattle, on the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19
commodities. The index retreated a second day, losing 0.6
percent as of 2:59 p.m. in New York as 13 of 19 commodities
declined.  Gasoline stockpiles in Padd 1, which includes East Coast
refineries, were 4.7 percent below year-earlier levels in the
week ended June 10, according to Energy Department data.  Reformulated Gasoline  Stockpiles of reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, were 20
percent lower than a year earlier, department data showed. The
Nymex futures contract covers reformulated gasoline blendstock,
or RBOB, delivered to New York Harbor.  “RBOB is the commodity that’s tight in New York Harbor,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston.  The premium over futures for prompt-delivery RBOB in the
New York Harbor spot market increased 3.37 cents to 15 cents a
gallon as of 1:51 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the largest gap since May 9. RBOB was 27 cents over
conventional gasoline, the most since at least November 2003.  Production units at Irving Oil Corp.’s 300,000-barrel-a-day
refinery in Saint John,  New Brunswick , were shut after a  power
failure  June 14. The refinery was operating “as usual” as of
yesterday, Leslie MacLeod, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail. The refinery ships more than half of its fuel production
to the U.S. Northeast.  A crude unit at ConocoPhillips’s 250,000-barrel-a-day
Bayway refinery in Linden,  New Jersey , operated at reduced rates
from June 1 to June 14 after a fire.  Delaware  City  PBF Energy Partners LP reported a unit shutdown this week
at its 182,200-barrel-a-day refinery in Delaware City, Delaware.
The plant is in the process of being started for the first time
since November 2009 when then-owner Valero Energy Corp. shut it
because of lack of demand.  “The market was expecting they would have finished
gasoline by June 15,” Lipow said.  Regular gasoline at the pump declined 0.4 cent to $3.685
yesterday, according to AAA data on its website.  Heating oil for July delivery added 1.9 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $3.0038 a gallon on the Nymex. Heating
oil’s premium to July gasoline narrowed to 5.44 cents, the
smallest margin since June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
