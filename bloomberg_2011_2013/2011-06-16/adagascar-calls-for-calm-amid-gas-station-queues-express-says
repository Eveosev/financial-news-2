Madagascar’s mines and hydrocarbons
minister, Mamy Rakotoarivelo, called for calm as queues formed
at gas stations across the country for a third day amid
speculation of a fuel shortage,  l’Express  reported.  Some outlets in the capital, Antananarivo, closed yesterday
as gasoline supplies were depleted, while there was panic buying
in the port of Toamasina, the inland cities of Antsirabe and
Fianarantsoa, and the west-coast town of Morondava, the
newspaper said.  Jovenna, an oil retailer, assured consumers that there were
no fuel shortages in the country, the newspaper said.  The security authorities are investigating whether stocks
of fuel haven’t been distributed properly, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
