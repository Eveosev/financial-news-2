DG FastChannel Inc. (DGIT) , the network
operator that links advertisers with radio and television
stations, is weighing a sale and working with  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  to find buyers, according to three people with
knowledge of the situation.  The Irving, Texas-based company, which has a market value
of about $755 million, may seek $1 billion, or about 10 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the plans
aren’t public. The company has started soliciting bids and most
of the potential buyers are private-equity firms, they said.  DG FastChannel fell 68 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $28.21 as
of 3:25 p.m.  New York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It
has dropped 29 percent in the past year.  The company tried to sell itself twice before, according to
the people. One attempt failed as buyers balked at the price,
while the company halted the process another time, these people
said. The current effort also may not lead to a deal.  JoAnn Horne, a spokeswoman for DG FastChannel, couldn’t be
reached for comment.  Andrea Rachman , a spokeswoman for Goldman,
declined to comment.  DG FastChannel said today it agreed to buy MediaMind
Technologies Inc., a New York-based provider of integrated
digital advertising solutions, for $517 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
