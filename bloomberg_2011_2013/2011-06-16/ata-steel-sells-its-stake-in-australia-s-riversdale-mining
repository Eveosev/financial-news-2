Rio Tinto  Group, the world’s second
largest mining company, gained almost full control of  Riversdale
Mining Ltd. (RIV)  as  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  agreed to sell its stake in the
Australian coal producer for A$1.06 billion ($1.12 billion.)  Tata’s 26.27 percent of Sydney-based Riversdale has almost
doubled in value in less than four years, India’s biggest steel
producer said in a statement to the Bombay stock exchange
yesterday. The transaction takes Rio’s holding to 99.47 percent.  Rio’s acquisition of Riversdale gives the world’s second-
largest mining company reserves of coking coal in Mozambique as
prices for the steelmaking ingredient increase. Tata said as
recently as April 25 that it would continue to hold its stake in
the Australian mining company. Rio’s offer of A$16.50 a share is
due to close June 17.  Tata Steel will retain a 35 percent stake in Riversdale
Energy (Mauritius) Ltd., a unit that owns coal assets in
 Mozambique , according to its statement.  Tata Steel shares fell 1.5 percent to 553.25 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. Rio dropped 0.8 percent to 4.080
pence in  London .  “Gaining full ownership of Riversdale is a great outcome
for Rio Tinto and we will work to accelerate the development of
the excellent tier-one coking coal resources in Mozambique,”
Rio said in an e-mailed statement.  Rio said in April it will seek to de-list Riversdale from
the Australian stock exchange once the takeover is completed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
