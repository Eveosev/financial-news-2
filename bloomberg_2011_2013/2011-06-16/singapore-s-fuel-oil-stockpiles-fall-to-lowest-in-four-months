Singapore’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , fell to the lowest in four months, data from a unit
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, dropped 13
percent to 18 million barrels in the seven days to June 15,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Stockpiles are at the lowest since Feb. 16.  Supplies of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, fell 2.9 percent to 14.7 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline dropped 2.2
percent to 9.3 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
