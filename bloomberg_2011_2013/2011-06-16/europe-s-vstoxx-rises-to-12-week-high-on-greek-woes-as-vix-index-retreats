The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options climbed to a three-month high on concern that the
 Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening and that regulators will
require large banks to increase reserves. Europe’s  VStoxx Index (V2X) 
also rose.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, rose 6.6 percent to 22.73 at 4:15 p.m. in  New
York . The index measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which
gained 0.2 percent. The VIX and the S&P 500 move in opposite
directions 81 percent of the time. The VStoxx Index, which
measures the cost of protecting against a decline in shares on
the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, added 5.9 percent to close at 24.43.  The MSCI All-Country World Index slid 0.7 percent to a
three-month low, and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.5 percent
to 266.73. The euro slumped and European government default risk
climbed to a record as Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
battled to keep his job and pass austerity measures.  “It’s something that’s becoming increasingly alarming from
our perspective,” Dean Curnutt, president of New York-based
Macro Risk Advisors LLC, which advises institutions on
derivatives, said in an interview with Erik Schatzker on
Bloomberg Television’s “Inside Track.” “Everyone’s looking at
 Greece .”  July VIX futures rose 4.8 percent to 21.95, while August’s
increased 4.9 percent to 22.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
