McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR)  lost 1,374
feet (419 meters) of drillpipe after “mechanical issues”
halted drilling of a well that’s seeking to tap several billion
barrels of crude in the  Gulf of Mexico .  McMoRan, which operates the well, is searching for the
missing pipe and drilling tools in the Blackbeard East well,
Energy XXI (Bermuda) Ltd. said in a statement. Energy XXI owns
an 18 percent stake in the project. Billionaire wildcatter
William “Tex” Moncrief is also an investor in the $190 million
well.  McMoRan Co-Chairman James “Jim Bob” Moffett estimated in
October 2008 that the prospect, located in 70 feet of water off
the coast of  Louisiana , holds “several billion” barrels of
oil. The well reached a depth of 32,559 feet below the surface
of the Gulf “before encountering mechanical issues,” Energy
XXI said.  McMoRan obtained control of the Blackbeard field in 2007 as
part of its $1.1 billion purchase of offshore assets from
Newfield Exploration Co. The previous operator,  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) , abandoned the prospect in 2006 after encountering
pressure surges and temperatures high enough to melt drill bits
in the first well drilled at that location, known as Blackbeard
West.  “We are continuing to address the mechanical issue that
was encountered in drilling the Blackbeard East well,” David Joint, a McMoRan spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement.
The explorer plans to deepen the well after the mechanical
issues have been resolved and wants to evaluate rock formations
deeper than 32,500 feet, he said.  Missing Pipe  McMoRan, based in  New Orleans , rose 2 cents to $15.56 at
4:00 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has fallen 9.2 percent this year. Energy XXI fell 17 cents
to $29.08 on the NASDAQ Stock Market.  McMoRan has recovered 1,866 feet of drillpipe that was
stuck in the well, Energy XXI said. McMoRan’s engineers have yet
to locate the remaining 1,374 feet of drillpipe and tools,
Energy XXI said.  Energy XXI and the other partners on the project still hope
to drill the well to the 34,000-foot depth allowed for in their
federal permit, Energy XXI said. John D. Schiller, chairman and
chief executive officer at Energy XXI, in April estimated the
total cost of the well would reach $190 million.  The missing drillpipe is equivalent to the length of four-
and-a-half American football fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
