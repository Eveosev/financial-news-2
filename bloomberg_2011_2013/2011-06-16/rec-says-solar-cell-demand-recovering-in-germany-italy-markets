Renewable Energy Corporation ASA
said demand for its solar energy components has risen in Germany
and  Italy  in the past few weeks after its competitors cut
production capacity.  The recovery in the two markets has been “quite good
during the last few weeks,” Chief Financial Officer Bjoern Brenna said in an interview in Oslo.  The company based in Sandvika,  Norway  announced last month
that it will halt output of solar wafers and cells at its
Heroeya and Narvik plants from July 1 following a drop in demand
in Italy. Brenna said the plants in Norway may resume production
by the end of the third quarter. A decision has yet to be made.  The price of solar cells, the main component of
photovoltaic panels, dropped in May as supply hit the market and
demand was curbed by cuts to subsidies for the technology across
 Europe , Bloomberg New Energy Finance said. The price of
multicrystalline cells fell 8 percent to $1.09 per watt in May,
according to data compiled by the London-based researcher.  Brenna said the company has kept inventory levels low, so
there won’t be a large writedown on unsold stock. REC had
forecast in its first quarter results  presentation  that
inventory levels may build in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
