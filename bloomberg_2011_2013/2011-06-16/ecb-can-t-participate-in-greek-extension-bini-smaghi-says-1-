European Central Bank Executive
Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the ECB couldn’t
participate in an extension of Greek debt maturities because it
would violate the bank’s rulebook.  Asking the ECB “to extend the maturities of the  government
bonds  it holds or to accept as collateral bonds from a state
that is considered to have defaulted for the refinancing
operations of the banking system is a violation” of rules, Bini
Smaghi said in a speech at the Vatican in Rome today. “Any
pressure whatsoever of this kind flouts the regulations on
independence that protect the ECB.”  European lawmakers are struggling to find a solution to
avert a Greek default. While German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said last week that Europe’s biggest economy insists
on the participation of the private sector, his French
counterpart  Christine Lagarde  has ruled out any action that
constitutes a “credit event,” backing the ECB’s view.  “Greece could have a contagion effect,” ECB Vice
President  Vitor Constancio  said yesterday. “That’s the reason
we are against any sort of default with haircuts and any form of
private-sector event that could lead to a  credit event  or a
rating event.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
