Layoffs are coming for Wall Street’s
fixed-income managing directors, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., as trading revenue and interest-rate
volatility have plummeted.  The percent of managing directors on staff at investment
banks are going to drop to about 10 percent from 15 percent at
well-run firms and from 20 percent at badly run firms, Hintz said
in a television interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance Midday” with
 Tom Keene .  “You don’t have to fire lots of people, you just need to
fire expensive people,” said New York-based Hintz, adding the
40 percent of compensation that goes to managing directors isn’t
sustainable. “You are going to change the shape of the
pyramid.”  This comes as fixed-income trading revenue at the five
biggest Wall Street banks -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., and Morgan
Stanley -- fell 25 percent in the first quarter, compared with
the first three months of 2010.  Volatility in the interest rates market has fallen to
almost pre-crisis levels as the Merrill Option Volatility
Estimate, or MOVE, has averaged 89.43 basis points so far this
year, headed for the lowest since it averaged 85 basis points in
2007. The index is at 85.9 basis points, down from a 12-month
high of 125.2 on Dec. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
