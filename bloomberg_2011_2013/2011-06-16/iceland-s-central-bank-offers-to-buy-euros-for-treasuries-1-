Iceland’s central bank offered to
buy 64 million euros ($91 million) in exchange for Treasury
bonds as part of its strategy to ease  capital controls .  “The aim of these measures is to recoup foreign currency
that the central bank of Iceland used to purchase offshore
kronur in the previous auction and sell kronur to buyers that
are prepared to hold them for at least five years,” the bank
said. “This is done by offering parties that own foreign
currency, not subject to repatriation requirements, the
opportunity to purchase long-term Treasury bonds.”  The central bank is inviting primary dealers to act as
intermediaries in the transactions, it said. Offers must be
submitted by June 28, it said.  Iceland imposed capital restrictions at the end of 2008 to
stem a sell-off of the krona triggered by the failure of the
island’s three biggest banks. The bank on June 7 said it
accepted offers to purchase 13.4 billion kronur ($115 million)
in offshore krona assets in exchange for foreign currency. The
measure is designed to ease pressure on the krona as the bank
eases its currency restrictions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
