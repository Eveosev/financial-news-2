U.S. stocks pared gains as people
familiar with the matter said international financial supervisors
are considering capital surcharges of as much as 3.5 percentage
points on the largest banks if they grow bigger.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,266.90 at 1:40 p.m. in  New York  after rallying as much as 0.7
percent earlier. Financial shares in the index were little
changed, erasing a gain of as much as 1.1 percent.  Draft plans circulated before a meeting next week of the
 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  would subject banks to a
sliding scale depending on their size and links to other
lenders, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the proposals aren’t public. Banks wouldn’t initially face the
highest surcharge, which is intended as a deterrent to
expansion, one person said. The largest banks may face a 3
percentage point levy at their current sizes, the
person said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
