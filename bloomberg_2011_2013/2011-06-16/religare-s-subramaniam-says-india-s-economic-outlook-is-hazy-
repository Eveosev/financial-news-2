Vetri Subramaniam, head of equities
at Religare Asset Management Co., comments on the outlook for
 India ’s stocks after the central bank raised  interest rates  for
the 10th time since the start of 2010.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
7.50 percent from 7.25 percent extending the longest streak of
monetary tightening in a decade after inflation accelerated.
Nineteen of 20 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predicted
the decision, while one expected no change.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
lost 0.4 percent to 18,051.98 at 12:13 p.m. in Mumbai, set for
its lowest close in three weeks.  Religare Asset had $2.6 billion in assets under management
at the end of March. Subramaniam spoke in a phone interview
today.  On rate increase:  “The only disappointment might be that there is no, very
explicit signal in terms of whether RBI believes we are getting
anywhere close to the end of the rate cycle.”  On market outlook:  “The concerns are still there. The bigger challenge is now
really on the fiscal side because our fiscal policy is way too
stimulative and it’s there that we need to get things under
control.  ‘‘Valuations are at reasonable levels.’’  On investment strategy:  Subramaniam said he is not altering his investment
strategy. Religare Asset continues to be overweight the domestic
consumption theme, he said.  ‘‘We are seeing a lot more opportunities for stock-picking,
but the macro outlook is still a bit hazy.  ‘‘We are happy to be stock-pickers in this environment.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
