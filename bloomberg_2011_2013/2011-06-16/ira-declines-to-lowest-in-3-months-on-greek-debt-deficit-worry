The lira weakened for a fifth day
against the dollar, the longest losing streak in five months, on
speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening and Turkey will
fail to contain a widening current-account deficit.  The lira dropped 0.6 percent 1.6175 per dollar at 2:54 p.m.
in Istanbul. The five-day retreat is the longest slump since
Jan. 11. Two-year benchmark bond yields gained 12 basis points
to 9.07 percent, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  is seeking to win a
confidence vote as violence erupted over budget cuts and
austerity measures needed for international aid. Turkey’s
current-account deficit ballooned to $7.7 billion in April, the
second-biggest gap since records began in 1984, even after the
central bank raised  reserve requirements  for banks four times
since December.  “Nobody knows what the central bank is going to do and it
is unknown what the government will do about the current-account
deficit,” Isik Okte, a trader at Finans Invest in Istanbul,
said in e-mailed comments. “Uncertainty on the behalf of the
government and the central bank is killing us.”  The  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  of stocks declined for a fourth
day, losing 0.5 percent at 60,626.04.  To contact the reporter on this story:
