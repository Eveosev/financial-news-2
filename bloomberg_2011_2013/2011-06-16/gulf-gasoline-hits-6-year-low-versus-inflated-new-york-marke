Gulf Coast  gasoline slipped to its
lowest level in six years versus futures contracts that have
been boosted by lower inventories of reformulated fuel in  New
York  Harbor.  The cash markets largely trade conventional gasoline and
the New York Mercantile Exchange grade is reformulated gasoline,
or RBOB, said Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply
consultant in  Kansas City . East Coast refinery outages this
month have curbed supplies of the latter fuel.  “This inflated value of the products in the New York
exchange has resulted in record low basis values for
conventional gasoline,” Lewis said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 2.25 cents to 19 cents versus futures traded
on the Nymex at 10:57 a.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prices haven’t dropped to such a level since February
2005. Prompt delivery fell 1.79 cents to $2.7567 a gallon.  Gasoline stockpiles in Padd 1, or the U.S. East Coast, were
4.7 percent below year-earlier levels in the week ended June 10,
according to Energy Department data. Stockpiles of reformulated
gasoline, or RBOB, were 20 percent lower than a year earlier,
department data showed.  Historically, the Gulf Coast spread has been minus 2 to
minus 8 cents, Lewis said. “The money is in the RBOB as some
refiners still cannot make the RBOB spec and so flood the market
with conventional gasoline.”  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in New York Harbor rose 3.25 cents to 14.88 cents a gallon, the
highest level since May 9.  A crude unit at  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s 250,000-barrel-a-day
Bayway refinery in Linden,  New Jersey , operated at reduced rates
from June 1 to June 14 after a fire.  Production units at Irving Oil Corp.’s 300,000-barrel-a-day
refinery in Saint John,  New Brunswick , were shut after a  power
failure  June 14. The refinery was operating “as usual” as of
yesterday, Leslie MacLeod, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail. The refinery ships more than half of its fuel production
to the U.S. Northeast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
