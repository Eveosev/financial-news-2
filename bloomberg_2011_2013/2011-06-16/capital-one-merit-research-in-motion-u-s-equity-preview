Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in U.S. trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 4 p.m. in  New York .  Credit-rating companies declined after the Wall Street
Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is considering laying civil fraud charges against
some of the firms for their actions on mortgage-backed bonds,
which helped trigger the financial crisis.  Moody’s Corp. (MCO)   fell 5 percent to $36.35 for the
biggest loss in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. McGraw-Hill
Cos. (MHP US), which owns S&P, retreated 3.6 percent to $39.61.  BPZ Resources Inc. (BPZ)   soared 17 percent, the most
since March 2009, to $3.53. The oil and gas company with
operations in  Peru  said its offshore Block Z-1 exploration has
best estimates of 981 million barrels of prospective oil
resources and 8.1 trillion cubic feet of gas resources.  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH)   advanced 3.2
percent to $67.65 for its biggest gain since April 20. Concerns
that the information-technology company’s suspension from an
accelerated visa processing program would hurt growth were
“overblown,” Kaufman Bros. said in a note to clients.  Flowserve Corp. (FLS)   rose 4.6 percent to $105.69 for
the third-biggest increase in the  S&P 500 . Shares of the pumps
and valves maker present a “compelling long term buying
opportunity” because concerns over project delays and lower
margins were “overblown,” Hamzah Mazari, an analyst with
Credit Suisse Group AG said in a note to clients.  Lender Processing Services Inc. (LPS)   slumped 13
percent, the biggest retreat in the Russell 1000 Index, to
$20.42. The provider of mortgage processing and default
management services cut its earnings forecast for the second
quarter to no more than 56 cents a share, below a previous
estimate of at least 79 cents and below the average analyst
prediction of 80 cents.  Merit Medical Systems Inc. (MMSI)   dropped 3.1 percent
to $18 for the biggest decline since May 23. The maker of
medical devices said it will sell shares in a public offering.
Proceeds will be used to repay debt, expand manufacturing
facilities and fund potential acquisitions.  Newcastle Investment Corp. (NCT)   rose the most in the
Russell 2000 Index, rallying 27 percent to $5.59. The New York-
based real estate investment trust announced a quarterly
dividend of 10 cents a share. The company had discontinued
dividends in December 2008.  Primo Water Corp. (PRMW)   surged 17 percent, the most
since March 11, to $13.14. The provider of bottled water and
water dispensers said it priced 6 million shares at $11.26 each,
raising money to repay debt.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)   tumbled 21 percent, the
most since September 2008, to $27.75. The maker of the
Blackberry smartphone forecast second-quarter revenue and profit
that missed analysts’ estimates and said it will cut jobs as a
lack of new models prompts consumers to buy rival devices.  Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. (SNI)   jumped 5.9
percent, the most in the S&P 500, to $47.14. The owner of Food
Channel may be seen as a more viable acquisition target after a
probate court petition by its biggest shareholder, a trust for
the Scripps family. The filing may be viewed as a positive for
the stock because the market may read it removing an obstacle to
an acquisition, Nomura Securities analyst Michael Nathanson said
today in an e-mail.  Seabridge Gold Inc. (SA)   rallied 4.8 percent, the most
since Feb. 23, to $26.32. Royal Gold Inc. (RGLD US) agreed to
buy a C$30 million ($30.6 million) stake in the mining company.  Zoran Corp. (ZRAN)   rose 15 percent, the most since Feb.
22, to $8.29. The maker of chips for digital audio and video
products accepted a lower price in the agreed merger with CSR
Plc (CSR LN). The transaction values Zoran at $9.19 per share or
about $484 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
