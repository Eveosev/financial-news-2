Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) , a metals
recycler, forecast second-quarter profit that is less than
analysts estimated as rising scrap-metal costs outpace the
company’s price increases.  Profit will rise to 35 cents to 40 cents a share this
quarter from 22 cents a year earlier, the  Fort Wayne , Indiana-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts had predicted
58 cents, the average of 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Steel Dynamics fell as much as 5.5 percent in after-hours
trading.  Profit margins from metal recycling narrowed because of
rising costs for copper and steel scrap, according to the
statement. The company also said structural steel orders fell
unexpectedly as the construction markets “remain a challenge.”  April orders for flat-rolled steel declined about 25
percent from the first quarter and then rebounded starting in
May, the company said. An unrealized hedging loss will reduce
profit by 3 cents a share this quarter, the company said.  Steel Dynamics fell to $14.50 at 6:15 p.m. New York time
after dropping 60 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $15.35 at the close
of regular Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have tumbled
16 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
