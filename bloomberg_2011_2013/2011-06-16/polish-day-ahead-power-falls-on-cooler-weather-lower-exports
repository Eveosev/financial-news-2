Polish day-ahead electricity
decreased in the past week as cooler weather damped demand and
power exports declined.  Next-day baseload power fell 2.3 percent to 210.73 zloty
($74.93) a megawatt-hour in the week ending today, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Polish Power Exchange data.  Daily demand for electricity was as high as 20,353
megawatts, down 3 percent from a week earlier, according to
 system load data .  Poland  planned to export 1,045 megawatts of
electricity at 1 p.m. tomorrow, when daily demand peaks,
according to the data from the grid operator. That compares with
a net import of 25 megawatts on June 13, when consumption in the
region was lower as  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest power market,
celebrated a public holiday.  Maximum temperatures in Warsaw may fall to 18 degrees
Celsius (64 Fahrenheit) on June 20 from today’s 27 degrees,
according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. Hot weather
boosts power demand for air conditioning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
