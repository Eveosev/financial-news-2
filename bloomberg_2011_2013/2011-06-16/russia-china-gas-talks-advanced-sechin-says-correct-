(Corrects location in second paragraph.)  Talks between  Russia  and China over
a gas-supply agreement are “considerably advanced,” Russian
Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin said.  Russian negotiators were instructed to speed up the talks,
Sechin said today in Moscow after meetings between Presidents
Dmitry Medvedev and  Hu Jintao .  The deal would give China “stability and the opportunity
to plan,” Medvedev said. For Russia, the agreement would
provide access to a growing market and long-term, stable prices,
which are “beneficial to our state,” he added.  Natural gas “is an important component of Russia-China
cooperation,” Hu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
