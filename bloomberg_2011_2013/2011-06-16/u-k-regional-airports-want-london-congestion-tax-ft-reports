U.K. regional airports urged the
government to impose a congestion tax on passengers and airlines
flying out of  London â€™s Heathrow and Gatwick, the Financial Times
reported.  A group of 10 airports, including Manchester, Newcastle,
Birmingham and Bristol, said the current air passenger duty of
as much as 170 pounds ($275) per person on long-haul flights at
all airports makes it difficult for those away from London to
attract airlines to start new services, the newspaper reported.  A congestion tax on Heathrow and Gatwick, they said, would
help to rebalance the economy and promote  job creation  and
investment in the regions by encouraging carriers and passengers
to make more use of capacity elsewhere, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
