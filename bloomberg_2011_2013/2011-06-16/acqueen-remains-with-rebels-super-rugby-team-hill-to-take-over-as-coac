Rod Macqueen,  Australia ’s 1999 World
Cup-winning coach, will remain with the Melbourne Rebels Super
Rugby team through the 2013 season as director of coaching.  Macqueen agreed to continue in the role, and will be
replaced as head coach by Damien Hill, his current assistant, on
a two-year contract, the Rebels said today.  “When selecting the coaching staff we always had
succession planning in place,” Macqueen, 61, said in a
statement. “Damien is very respected by peers and players
alike, and he strongly reflects the culture that we are
endeavoring to build at the Rebels.”  Macqueen, who will also join the Rebels’ board, has guided
the team to three wins in its first season in the southern
hemisphere’s top provincial rugby competition. The Rebels finish
their campaign tomorrow with a home match against Australian
rival Western Force.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
