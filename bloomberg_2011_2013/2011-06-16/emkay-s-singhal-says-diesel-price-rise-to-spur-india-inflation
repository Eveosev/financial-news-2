Sandeep Singhal, co-head of
institutional equity at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.,
comments on the outlook for Indian stocks after the central bank
raised  interest rates  for the 10th time since the beginning of
2010.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
7.50 percent from 7.25 percent today, extending the longest
streak of monetary tightening in a decade after inflation
accelerated. Nineteen of 20 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey predicted the decision, while one expected no change.  “We expect a further 50 basis points increase this year.
Inflation has not moderated as much as RBI wished, which is a
concern. RBI can’t afford to not increase rates.  ‘‘An anticipated increase in diesel prices will spur
inflation. A 4 rupees per liter increase in diesel price may
increase inflation by 40 basis points. A cascading effect will
lead to a 1.3 percent jump in overall inflation.  ‘‘We don’t expect the rate action to have a major impact on
stocks. We expect infrastructure financiers like Rural
Electrification Corp. and Power Finance Corp. to gain as there
was no harsh measure to restrict bank lending to non-banking
finance companies. Markets will watch out for the impact of
ending of QE2 in the U.S. on overseas fund flows.’’  QE2 refers to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s second round of
asset purchases, known as quantitative easing. It ends this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
