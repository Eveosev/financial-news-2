The cost of insuring against default
on Greek, Irish and Portuguese government debt surged to
records, driving a gauge of sovereign bond risk to an all-time
high, on concern  Europe ’s deficit crisis is worsening.  Credit-default swaps on Greece soared 435 basis points to
2,189, while Ireland rose 37 to 799 and Portugal climbed 21 to
806, according to CMA prices at 5 p.m. in London. The Markit
iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments
jumped 9 basis points to 235. An increase signals deteriorating
perceptions of  credit quality .  Investors are betting Greece will default if it’s unable to
pass the austerity measures needed to qualify for the next
installment of international aid. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was set to shuffle his Cabinet and seek to win a
confidence vote today as protests over budget cuts fueled
speculation the measures will be put in jeopardy.  “A failure to reach a political agreement in  Greece  risks
the next tranche of funds, due to be paid at the end of this
month, to be withheld,” said  Gary Jenkins , co-head of fixed
income at Evolution Securities in London. “If unresolved then
this could potentially result in a default by the middle of
July.”  Investor confidence was also hurt by comments from Irish
Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  that senior bondholders should
share in the losses of Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and Irish
 Nationwide Building Society , reversing a policy of protecting
owners of senior securities.  Spain, Italy  Swaps on Spain climbed 15 basis points to 301, the highest
since January, Italy rose 8 to 183 and Belgium was 8 higher at
159.  The cost of insuring European corporate debt also rose. The
Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings increased 1 basis point to 112.75 basis points,
the highest since Jan. 10, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 5 basis points to 418. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers fell 8.5 basis points to 171.5 and the subordinated
index was 8 lower at 300.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
