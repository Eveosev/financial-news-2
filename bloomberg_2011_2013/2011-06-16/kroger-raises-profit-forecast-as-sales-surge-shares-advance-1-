Kroger Co. (KR) , the largest U.S. grocery
chain, raised its full-year profit forecast after sales surged
last quarter, pushing the shares up the most since October 2009.  Earnings will be as much as $1.95 a share, Cincinnati-based
Kroger said today in a statement. That compares with a previous
forecast of up to $1.92. Analysts on average anticipate $1.90,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Total sales surged 11 percent to $27.5 billion in the first
quarter, bolstered by fuel sales. Kroger, led by Chief Executive
Officer David Dillon, is raising prices to help compensate for
increasing costs for food and gas. The grocer is vying with
discount chains such as  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  and  Target Corp. (TGT) 
for budget-wary shoppers.  The shares advanced $1.04, or 4.5 percent, to $23.99 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The gain was
the largest since Oct. 15, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
