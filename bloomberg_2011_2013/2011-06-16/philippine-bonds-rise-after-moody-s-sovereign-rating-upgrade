Philippine three-year bonds rose,
halting a three-day decline, after Moody’s Investors Service
raised the nation’s  credit rating  yesterday to two steps below
investment grade.  The upgrade will attract more funds from abroad, helping to
create jobs and spur economic growth, Finance Secretary Cesar
Purisima said in a Bloomberg TV interview today. Moody’s lifted
the sovereign by one step to Ba2, on par with Standard & Poor’s
and Fitch Ratings. Ten of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
predict the central bank will increase the benchmark interest
rate today by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75 percent, while the
rest forecast no change.  “The outlook for a better credit rating is positive for
the market,” said Yvette Marquez-Carlos, who helps manage the
equivalent of $11 billion at BPI Asset Management in  Manila .
“For today, the market is still preoccupied with the central
bank rate decision.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.85 percent as
of 11:52 a.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial
Services. The peso dropped 0.2 percent to 43.46 per dollar,
prices from Tullett Prebon Plc show.  The central bank must ensure  price stability , Purisima said
today, adding that inflation has been primarily driven by oil.
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas raised its benchmark rate by a
quarter of a percentage point at meetings in March and May,
taking it to 4.5 percent.  Budget Surplus   Consumer prices rose 4.5 percent in May from a year earlier,
the fastest pace in 13 months, official data showed on June 7.
The central bank will assess the impact of the two interest-rate
increases, Governor Amando Tetangco said June 10. Policy makers
have a “number of instruments” to deal with inflation, he said
June 12.  The  Philippines  is due to issue data on the budget balance
next week. The government reported a surplus of 26.3 billion
pesos ($605 million) for April as revenue rose and spending fell.
The surplus was 61 million pesos in the first four months of the
year, compared with a deficit of 131.80 billion pesos in the
same period in 2010. The shortfall was a record 314 billion
pesos last year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
