The  Boston Bruins  lead the  Vancouver 
Canucks 3-0 after the second period in the deciding game of the
National Hockey League’s Stanley Cup Final.  Boston’s  Patrice Bergeron  redirected Brad Marchand’s center
off goal tender Roberto Luongo’s right-hand post and into the
net after 14 minutes, 37 seconds of the game at Rogers Arena in
Vancouver.  Rookie Marchand got his 10th goal of the playoffs 12:13
into the second period when he took the puck behind the Canucks’
net before slipping it past the sprawling Luongo into the net.  Bergeron made it 3-0 with a short-handed goal with 2:35
remaining in the second period after Boston’s Zdeno Chara got a
two-minute penalty for interference.   The team that scored first won each of the previous six
games in the series. The host team has won 12 of 15 previous
 Stanley Cup  Final deciders.  The Canucks lost on their previous trips to the
championship series in 1982 and 1994. The Bruins have been
beaten five times in the Stanley Cup Final, most recently in
1990, since they collected the last of their five NHL titles in
1972.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
