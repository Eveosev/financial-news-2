Mosaid Technologies Inc. (MSD) ’s patent-
infringement claims against  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the world’s
largest maker of networking equipment, will be reviewed by the
U.S. International Trade Commission, the agency said.  Mosaid’s complaint claims certain Cisco routers and modems
made overseas and sold in the U.S. infringe six patents related
to power-over-Ethernet products, which carry electrical current
over data cables rather than power cords. The ITC, which
announced the institution of the investigation  today , said it
hasn’t made any decision on the merits of the case.  Mosaid is an Ontario-based designer of semiconductors that
received all of its C$71 million ($72 million) in revenue last
fiscal year from patent licensing, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  San Jose , California-based Cisco said May 18 that
Mosaid was seeking to evade a case pending in federal court in
Delaware in which Cisco is challenging Mosaid patents.  The Washington-based ITC can block imports of products
found to violate U.S. patents. The agency’s reviews typically
take 15 to 18 months.  The case is In the Matter of Communications Networks,
including Switches, Routers, Gateways, Bridges, Wireless Access
Points, Cable Modems, IP Phones, 337-778, U.S. International
Trade Commission ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
