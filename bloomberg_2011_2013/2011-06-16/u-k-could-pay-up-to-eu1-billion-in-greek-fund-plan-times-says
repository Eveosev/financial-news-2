The U.K. may have to contribute
between 700 million euros ($993 million) and 1 billion euros to
a second rescue fund for  Greece  if  Germany  succeeds in
persuading other European Union nations to include an emergency
fund of 6 billion euros to 8 billion euros in the new bailout,
the Times reported, citing unidentified officials in Brussels.  The U.K. would be obliged to participate despite not being
in the euro area because of an agreement signed by the previous
Labour government, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
