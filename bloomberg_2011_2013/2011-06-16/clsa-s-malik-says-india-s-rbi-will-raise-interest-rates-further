Rajeev Malik, a senior economist at
CLSA Asia Pacific Markets in Singapore, comments on today’s
decision by the  Reserve Bank  of India to raise  interest rates 
for the fourth time this year.  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao increased the repurchase rate to
7.50 percent from 7.25 percent, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  “Inflation still remains above RBI’s comfort level, while
monetary transmission has strengthened. The key operative
element is while the Reserve Bank will continue with its anti-
inflationary stance, the extent of policy action needs to
balance the adverse movements in inflation with recent global
developments and their impact on growth.  “From here on, the pace of increases is likely to be
slower. They aren’t done with the tightening.  “There’s nothing in this policy that will prompt me to
change our expectation of 8 percent on repo rate for this
year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
