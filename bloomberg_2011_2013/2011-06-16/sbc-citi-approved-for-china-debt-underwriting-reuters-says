HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
received initial approval for their Chinese units to underwrite
corporate debt in the country, Reuters reported, citing two
unidentified people with direct knowledge of the situation.  The National Association of Financial Market Institutional
Investors, an industry association that supervises China’s debt
market under the central bank, made the approval, the report
said. The banks still have to register with the People’s Bank of
China before beginning operations, it said.  --Eva Woo, Editor: Russell Ward  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
