The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  against non-payment rose to the highest
in more than six months, according to traders of credit-default
swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 2.5 basis points to 117.5 as of
8:31 a.m. in Beijing, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc prices. The index is on course for its highest level since
Nov. 30, according to data from CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 4 basis points to
118.5 as of 10:40 a.m. in Sydney, Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. Thatâ€™s on course for its highest
level since Sept. 28, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 3.5 basis points to
132.5 as of 9:34 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  --Henry Sanderson. Editor: Ed Johnson  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
