Barcelona President Sandro Rosell
says the European soccer champion will end institutional
relations with Real Madrid next season should its archrival
continues to be unsporting.  Rosell said Real coach  Jose Mourinho  “passed all the
boundaries of sporting rivalry” when he said after the first
part of their  Champions League  semifinal in April that
counterpart Josep Guardiola should be ashamed of Barcelona’s
success because it’s favored by referees.  Tension between the clubs increased as they faced off four
times at the climax of last season. Barcelona came out on top on
the field, taking the Spanish league and Champions League. Real
won the Copa del Rey.  “The rivalry will continue next season but we won’t allow
them to pass the limits of sportsmanlike behavior,” Rosell said
in comments on Barcelona’s website.  As part of institutional relations, directors of both clubs
have lunch or dinner together before their teams play in what’s
known as ‘El Clasico.’ The presidents of both clubs sit
alongside during the game.  Mourinho, who made the comments after Real had defender
Pepe ejected in a 3-1 loss, got a five-game ban and was fined
50,000 euros ($71,000) by European soccer ruling body UEFA for
the outburst. Real is appealing the decision.  Rosell also said Real  Madrid  was the source of a report on
radio station Cadena Cope in March that linked Barcelona’s team
with doping. Barcelona is suing the Spanish broadcaster.  To contact the reporters on this story:
