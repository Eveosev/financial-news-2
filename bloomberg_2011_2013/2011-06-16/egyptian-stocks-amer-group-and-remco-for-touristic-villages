Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
retreated for a second day, declining 0.3 percent to 5,541.64 at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The measure has gained 0.7 percent
this week.  The following shares rose or fell in Cairo. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Amer Group Holding (AMER)   climbed 3.6 percent to 1.44
Egyptian pounds, the highest close in more than two months. The
Cairo-based real-estate and resorts developer said first-quarter
profit was 133.9 million Egyptian pounds ($23 million), little
changed from the fourth quarter, before popular unrest overthrew
the country’s government.  The company didn’t provide a comparative figure for the
first quarter of 2010 because it said it didn’t have audited
figures for that period.  Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services (EMOB EY) fell as much as
1.3 percent before closing 0.6 percent lower at 138.98 pounds.
The Cairo-based mobile-network operator expects to start mobile-
phone banking services by the end of the year, Chief Executive
Officer Hassan Kabbani said today.  Egypt ’s central bank said in October it planned to approve
the regulation for mobile-phone banking “in the next few
months,” but has since delayed taking action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
