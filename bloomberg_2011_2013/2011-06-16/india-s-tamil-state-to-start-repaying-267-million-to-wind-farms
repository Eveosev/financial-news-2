The southern Indian state of  Tamil
Nadu , home to 40 percent of the nation’s wind capacity, agreed
to make the first payment this week on part of the 12 billion
rupees ($267 million) it owes wind farms for power supplies.  The state-run utility Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution
Corp. hasn’t paid wind farm owners for electricity they’ve
supplied to the grid since last July, said K. Kasthoorirangian,
who chairs the Indian Wind Power Association, the country’s
largest industry group for the sector.  The newly elected state government promised to settle the
arrears beginning with a 3.5 billion-rupee payment this week,
Kasthoorirangian said today by phone.  Companies that own operating wind farms in the state
include  Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZ) , a unit of billionaire Anil
Agrawal’s  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , the local unit of  CLP Holdings
Ltd. (2) , Hong Kong’s biggest electricity producer, and Tata Power
Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
