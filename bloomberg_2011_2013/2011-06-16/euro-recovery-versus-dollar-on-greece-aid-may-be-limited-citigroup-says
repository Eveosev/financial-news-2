A rebound in the euro if the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  agree to give
Greece an installment of aid will be limited and temporary,
according to Citigroup Inc.  “The uncertainty that has been generated by the process is
going to continue to weigh on the euro,” said Steven Englander,
head of Group of 10 currency strategy at Citigroup in  New York ,
in a telephone interview. “The process itself and the degree to
which this process is unsatisfactory become a part of the
determination of asset prices.”  The euro today gained 0.2 percent to $1.4204, after
touching $1.4074, the lowest level since May 26. The 17-nation
currency tumbled 1.8 percent yesterday, the most in six weeks.  Englander didn’t specify how much the euro would fall or
bounce back.  “In the near term, the euro still faces challenges,” he
said. “If it does bounce, the bounce would be temporary.”  The euro has depreciated 0.3 percent in the past week
against nine other developed-nation currencies, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The dollar has
rallied 0.8 percent.  Greece ’s immediate concern is to obtain 8.7 billion euros
($12.4 billion) from  Europe  and 3.3 billion euros from the IMF
in July, promised as part of last year’s precedent-setting aid
package to stave off the euro area’s first default.  European finance ministers will meet on June 19 after an
emergency session two days ago broke up without an accord on the
next loan disbursement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
