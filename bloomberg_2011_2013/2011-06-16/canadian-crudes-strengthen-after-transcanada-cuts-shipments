Syncrude and Western Canada Select
strengthened after  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  said it would restrict June
and July oil shipments on the 591,000-barrel-a-day Keystone
pipeline.  The Calgary-based company said yesterday it would curtail
shipments by 12 percent, moving 400,000 to 450,000 barrels a day
while fittings were modified and replaced. The line, which
transports crude from  Alberta  to  Oklahoma , was shut twice last
month after leaks at pump stations in  North Dakota  and  Kansas .  “We have discovered a number of areas in the course of our
thorough investigation into the Ludden and Severance releases
that we wish to be proactive in addressing,” Terry Cunha, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday.  The premium for Syncrude widened 55 cents to $9.35 a barrel
over West Texas Intermediate at 1:50 p.m. in  New York , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur
synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.
The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 85 cents to
$18.30.  The gap between WTI and the Brent August contract widened
96 cents to $18.71 a barrel as of 2:40 p.m. in New York. When
Brent rises versus WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur
U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced against
the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium over WTI gained $1.10 to
$18.25 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 90 cents to $18.35
over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 65 cents to $12.65 a barrel. Poseidon was unchanged.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained $1 to $17 a barrel, while
Southern Green Canyon’s premium added 40 cents to $10.75. West
Texas Sour’s discount widened 5 cents to $1.60 a barrel.  The premium for Bakken crude, a light, sweet oil grade, was
unchanged at $5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
