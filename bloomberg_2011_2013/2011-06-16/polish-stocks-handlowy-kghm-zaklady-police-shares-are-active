Poland ’s WIG20 Index fell 2.81, or
0.1 percent, to 2,863.81 at 2:46 p.m. in Warsaw, retreating for
a second day.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Bank Handlowy SA (BHW PW), majority-owned by Citigroup
Inc., snapped two days of declines, climbing 1.75 zloty, or 2
percent, to 90.65 zloty. Its 14-day relative strength index,
which shows how rapidly prices advanced or dropped during a
specified time period, was at 26.7 yesterday. A reading of 30 or
below signals to some technical analysts that shares are set to
rise.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, lost 0.4 zloty, or 0.2 percent, to
187.2 zloty, falling for the first time in three days. Copper
dropped on concern  Greece ’s debt crisis may slow economic
growth, curbing demand for industrial metals.  Zaklady Chemiczne Police (PCE PW), the fertilizer maker
majority-owned by the Polish government, fell 0.6 percent, or
0.08 zloty to 13.7 zloty.  Azoty Tarnow, also controlled by the
government, offered to buy 66 percent of Chemiczne Police for
11.5 zloty a share, according to a regulatory statement late
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
