Individual investors and newsletter
writers are the most bearish on U.S. stocks since at least
August, a sign the six-week slump may be nearing an end,
according to analysts who use charts to predict markets.  The 7.2 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
since its April high through yesterday has turned more investors
pessimistic as economic reports stoked concern the economy is
slowing. A survey from the  American Association  of Individual
Investors showed bears outnumbering bulls by the biggest margin
since August. The ratio of bullish-to-bearish publications in
Investors Intelligence’s survey was the lowest since September.  “We have some fear in the market,”  Katie Stockton , MKM
Partners’ chief market technician, said in an interview from
Greenwich,  Connecticut . “It’s a good thing from a contrarian
perspective in that a market low typically is established when
there is fear in the market.”  More pessimism suggests shares are likely to rise because
bearish investors may have sold their holdings and would have to
buy to get back in. The  S&P 500  posted its longest losing weekly
streak since 2008 as reports on jobs and manufacturing missed
economists’ estimates and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. recovery was “frustratingly slow.”  The AAII’s weekly survey showed 43 percent of the
respondents were pessimistic, the ninth consecutive week that
bearish sentiment stayed above its historic average of 30
percent. Bulls accounted for 29 percent, down from a peak of 63
percent on Dec. 23. The ratio of bears to bulls was 1.47, the
second-highest reading  since Aug. 26 after last week’s 1.95.
The last time bears outnumbered bulls by a wider margin, the S&P
500 rallied in five of the seven following months.  Bearish Writers  Bears also grew among newsletter writers. The proportion of
bears in  Investors Intelligence’s  latest weekly survey rose to
26 percent, the highest since October, from 23 percent.
Optimistic newsletters amounted to 37 percent, down from 41
percent. The ratio of bullish-to-bearish publications of 1.42-
to-1 was the lowest since September.  The options market also showed signs of rising pessimism.
The ratio of puts to calls on U.S. equities rose to 1.11
yesterday, the highest since November 2008, Bloomberg data show.  Christopher Verrone , head of  technical analysis  at New
York-based Strategas Research Partners, said that before last
week, there had been 11 other occasions when the put/call ratio
exceeded 1 and at the same time the S&P 500 was trading above a
rising 200-day moving average. In all the circumstances, the
market posted gains in the next 12 months, with returns
averaging 11 percent. Calls convey the right, without the
obligation, to buy a security at a set price by a given date,
while puts give investors the right to sell.  Rally Tempered  The S&P 500’s slump since the end of April cost the
benchmark index the biggest rally in more than five decades. The
measure gained 102 percent between March 9, 2009, and April 29
of this year, the largest advance over the same period of time
since 1955, according to  Howard Silverblatt  at S&P. Through last
week, it was up 88 percent, the most since 1999.  Stockton said she expects the S&P 500 to fall below 1,250,
a level close to the benchmark’s 2011 low and its 200-day moving
average of 1,256.80, before resuming its advance.  “You get a move below it, it spooks a lot of people and
you get even greater spikes in the sentiment data, and that’s
when we get a real low,” Stockton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
