Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.,  Southeast
Asia ’s largest container-shipping line, rose the most in a month
in  Singapore  trading after it announced $1.54 billion in ship
orders and upgrades.  Its shares climbed as much as 2 percent to S$1.56 from
yesterday’s one-year low of S$1.53 after UBS downgraded its
outlook for the Asian container-shipping sector.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
