(Corrects number of lawmakers in second paragraph.)  A multi-party group of Japanese
lawmakers, representing about a third of parliament, favor
the central bank buying more  government bonds  to pay for
rebuilding from the March earthquake and nuclear crisis.  The Bank of  Japan  should agree “to buy all the
government bonds for reconstruction through purchase
operations,” according to a statement released to today in
 Tokyo  by 211 legislators from the  Democratic Party of Japan 
and five other parties. There are 722 legislators in the
upper and lower houses of the Diet.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  won lower house approval last
week for legislation authorizing the sale of bonds to pay for
rebuilding from the disaster. A June 11  draft proposal  from
the government’s reconstruction panel said future generations
shouldn’t have to bear the burden of paying for the recovery,
signaling that taxes may have to be increased.  The legislative group has increased its membership since
forming in April. Today’s meeting was attended by former
prime minister Shinzo Abe of the  Liberal Democratic Party 
government, and Akiko Kamei, policy chief for Kan’s coalition
partner People’s New Party.  The  Bank of Japan  two days ago limited its extra
assistance for the earthquake-hit economy to a $6 billion
lending program to help companies without real estate
collateral. The bank will make 500 billion yen in funds
available to banks to make equity investments and to lend to
companies, the bank said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
