The  International Monetary Fund  said
it is ready to continue supporting Greece if the economic
measures agreed upon as part of a bailout package with the
European Union are adopted.  “We stand ready to continue our support for Greece subject
to adoption of the economic policy reforms agreed with the Greek
authorities,”  Caroline Atkinson , the director of IMF external
relations, said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Progress is being made in the discussions to ensure the
full financing of the program, and we anticipate a positive
outcome on this at the next Eurogroup meeting,” she said.  She also said that the IMF board will still have to approve
the “conclusions of the pending program review.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
