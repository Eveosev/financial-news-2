Gold prices will likely drop further
on so-called seasonality after reaching a record in May,
according to  technical analysis  by Commerzbank AG.  “We will hold onto this bearish outlook as long as the
current June high of $1,554.10 isn’t being exceeded on a daily
closing basis,” analyst  Karen Jones  said in a report yesterday.
“Otherwise we will most likely be proved wrong with the May
all-time high around $1,577 then being back in the picture.”  Gold climbed to a record $1,577.57 an ounce on May 2 and
advanced 7.4 percent this year as investors sought protection
against sovereign-debt turmoil in Europe and accelerating global
inflation. The  European Central Bank  said yesterday the threat
of the Greek debt crisis spilling over into the banking sector
was the biggest risk to financial stability. Bullion traded at
$1,526.25 an ounce at 12:47 p.m. in  Tokyo .  “For now we expect the 2011 uptrend line at $1,515 to be
breached,” Jones said. This view is reinforced by seasonality,
which points to a decline in prices in the first half of June
and during July, Commerzbank analyst  Axel Rudolph  said in a note
on June 14.  The bank puts support between $1,513.90 and $1,501.70 and
then as low as $1,442.70, the 50 percent retracement of the 2011
advance, according to Jones. A support level is an area where
analysts anticipate buy orders.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Some analysts and traders use a
combination of indicators and levels to form both short- and
long-term forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
