Housing starts in the U.S. increased
more than forecast in May, led by a jump in the West as other
parts of the country languished.  Work began on 560,000 houses at an annual pace, up 3.5
percent from the prior month and exceeding the 545,000 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, figures from
the Commerce Department showed today in  Washington . Building
permits, a sign of future construction, also increased.  Falling real estate values and the threat that foreclosures
will push prices even lower mean the  construction industry  will
continue to lag behind other parts of the economy. Joblessness
exceeding 9 percent indicates that a rebound in housing will take
years to develop.  “Builders just aren’t making profits and so they aren’t
putting out homes,” said  Patrick Newport , an economist at IHS
Global Insight in Lexington,  Massachusetts . “There’s just
general uncertainty about the economy and housing prices, and
that’s what’s keeping housing from improving.”  Another Commerce Department report today showed the current-
account deficit in the U.S. increased less than forecast in the
first quarter as the country’s income surplus climbed to a
record. The gap, the broadest measure of international trade
because it includes income payments and government transfers,
widened to $119.3 billion from a $112.2 billion shortfall in the
fourth quarter.  Fewer Firings  Fewer Americans than forecast filed applications for
 unemployment benefits  last week, indicating the pickup in firings
that began in April is abating, figures from the Labor Department
also showed. Jobless claims declined by 16,000 to 414,000 in the
week ended June 11. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected
420,000 filings, according to the median forecast.  Stock-index futures trimmed earlier losses after the
reports. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing
in September fell 0.2 percent to 1,257.7 at 8:46 a.m. in  New York 
after being down as much as 0.5 percent.  Treasury securities 
rose, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to
2.91 percent from 2.97 percent late yesterday.  Housing starts estimates ranged from 493,000 to 585,000 in
the Bloomberg survey of 78 economists.  The Commerce Department revised April’s total to a 541,000
pace, up from a previously estimated 523,000.  More Permits  Building permits climbed 8.7 percent to a 612,000 annual
pace in May, the most this year. The increase was led by a 23
percent jump in applications for work on multifamily units. They
were projected to drop 1.1 percent to a 557,000 level, according
to the survey median.  Construction of single-family houses increased 3.7 percent
to a 419,000 rate in May from the prior month. Work on
multifamily homes, such as townhouses and apartments, rose 2.9
percent to an annual rate of 141,000.  Starts climbed in two of the four regions, led by an 18
percent jump in the West that took construction in that area to
the highest level since August.  Work began on 1.5 percent more houses in the South, failing
to make up for the 21 percent plunge the prior month when
flooding and tornadoes closed work sites. Starts dropped 4.1
percent in the Midwest and 3.3 percent in the Northeast.  Growing Pessimism  Confidence among U.S. homebuilders plunged in June, led by a
decline in the outlook for sales. The National Association of
Home Builders/Wells Fargo sentiment index declined to 13 this
month from 16 in May, data from the Washington-based group showed
yesterday. A measure of sales expectations for the next six
months matched the lowest level on record.  Firms like  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV)  are still struggling
to turn a profit in the U.S. housing market. The largest
homebuilder in  New Jersey  reported a net loss for the three
months ended April 30 that was wider than analysts estimated.  Sales of existing homes, which make up more than 90 percent
of the market, fell 4 percent to a 4.85 million annual pace in
May, economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the National
Association of Realtors may report on June 21. Existing home
sales have been gaining market share from new homes due to
growing demand for lower-priced distressed homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
