Workers at  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ’s
South Korean banking unit plan to strike from June 27 to protest
the company’s plan to change its salary system, leaving the bank
with about half its workforce.  About 3,000 union members at  Standard Chartered  First Bank
Korea Ltd. plan to walk off the job “indefinitely,” Bae Kwang
Jin, a spokesman for the workers’ union, said by phone today.
The unit’s total workforce was about 6,500 as of March 31,
according to the lender’s regulatory filing.  London-based Standard Chartered operates five affiliates in
South Korea under holding company Standard Chartered Korea Ltd.,
which was formed after the U.K. lender purchased Korea First
Bank for $3.3 billion in 2005. The bank will continue resolution
talks with the union and a strike decision is “regrettable,”
Standard Chartered First Bank said in an e-mailed statement.  Workers will strike until the company agrees not to adopt
an incentive-based salary system that the union says will create
excessive competition among workers and may cut salaries by as
much as 46 percent, according to Bae.  Standard Chartered has prepared measures to minimize the
impact a strike would have on its customers, it said in the
statement.  South Korea  accounted for about 11 percent of the
lender’s total $16 billion in revenue last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
