A European Union proposal to make
serial numbers of carbon allowances confidential may worsen
trader concerns about potential liabilities arising from
handling stolen permits, said a lobby group.  A plan seeking to protect transfers and remove serial
numbers “does not provide enough certainty” and is opposed by
“many” unspecified member states, Miles Austin, director of
the Carbon Markets & Investors’ Association, said today in an e-
mailed statement. “The underlying risk of potentially facing
legal consequences when unknowingly handling stolen allowances
or credits is not appropriately addressed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
