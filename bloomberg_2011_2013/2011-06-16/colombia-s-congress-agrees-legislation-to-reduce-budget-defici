Colombia ’s Senate and lower house of
congress reconciled two versions of legislation that will allow
the Andean nation to capitalize on its oil and mining riches,
cut its deficit and create a fund to cushion the economy during
crises.  The so-called fiscal rule, which was approved June 14 in
the  Senate  and in the  lower house  on May 4, targets a central
government  budget deficit  of no more than 2.3 percent of gross
domestic product in 2014 and 1.9 percent of GDP in 2018. It
seeks to narrow the gap to no more than 1 percent by 2022.  The legislation also creates a dollar-denominated rainy day
fund that will maintain excess mining and energy revenue
overseas, limiting gains by the peso.  The bill now goes to President  Juan Manuel Santos  to be
signed into law.  Colombia’s central government will have a deficit this year
of 4 percent of GDP and the consolidated  budget  deficit, which
includes provinces, municipalities and state-run companies, is
forecast at 3.4 percent, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
