The following is the text of
the U.S. international transactions report from the
Commerce Department.  Current Account  The U.S. current-account  deficitùthe combined
balances on trade in goods and services,  income, and net
unilateral current transfersùincreased to $119.3 billion
(preliminary) in the first quarter of 2011, from $112.2
billion (revised) in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The
increase was more than accounted for by an increase in the
deficit on goods.  Increases in the surplus on income and
the surplus on services and a decrease in net unilateral
current transfers were partly offsetting.  Goods and services  The deficit on goods and services increased to
$140.8 billion in the first quarter from $118.7 billion in
the fourth.  Goods  The deficit on goods increased to $182.5 billion in
the first quarter from $159.2 billion in the fourth.  Goods exports increased to $361.3 billion from
$342.7 billion.  Most major end-use categories increased;
industrial supplies and materials accounted for nearly 80
percent of the increase. The increase in industrial
supplies and materials mainly reflected growth in
petroleum and products and in nonferrous metals.
Automotive vehicles, parts, and engines also increased
strongly.  (See Table 2a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=20&area_id=3) for the latest available
statistics.)  Goods imports increased to $543.8 billion from
$501.9 billion.  Most major end-use categories increased;
two-thirds of the increase was accounted for by gains in
industrial supplies and materials.  Gains in automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines also contributed. Industrial
supplies and materials increased substantially as a result
of strong growth in petroleum and products.  Automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines increased mostly as a result
of increases in passenger cars and in other parts and
accessories. (See Table 2a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=20&area_id=3) for the latest available
statistics.)  Services  The surplus on services increased to $41.7 billion
in the first quarter from $40.5 billion in the fourth.  Services receipts increased to $144.9 billion from
$142.1 billion.  The largest increases were in other
private services and in travel.  Services payments increased to $103.2 billion from
$101.6 billion.  The largest increases were in other
transportation and in other private services.  Income  The surplus on income increased to $54.8 billion in
the first quarter from $39.9 billion in the fourth.  Investment income  Income receipts on U.S.-owned assets abroad
increased to $176.7 billion from $170.9 billion.  Most of
the increase was accounted for by direct investment
receipts.  Other private receipts (which consists of
interest and dividends) also increased.  Income payments on foreign-owned assets in the
 United States  decreased to $119.6 billion from $128.7
billion.  The decrease was more than accounted for by a
decrease in direct investment payments.  An increase in
other private payments (which consists of interest and
dividends) was partly offsetting.  Compensation of employees  Receipts for compensation of U.S. workers abroad
increased slightly to $1.4 billion in the first quarter
from $1.3 billion in the fourth.  Payments for
compensation of foreign workers in the United States
remained at $3.6 billion.  Unilateral current transfers  Net unilateral current transfers to foreigners were
$33.2 billion in the first quarter, down from $33.4
billion in the fourth.  The decrease was more than
accounted for by U.S. government grants; an increase in
private remittances and other transfers was partly
offsetting.  Capital Account  Net capital account payments remained close to zero
in the first quarter.  Financial Account  Net financial inflows were $181.9 billion in the
first quarter, up from $29.3 billion in the fourth.
Growth in both foreign-owned assets in the United States
and U.S.-owned assets abroad increased from that of the
fourth quarter; however, the increase in foreign-owned
assets was greater than that of U.S.-owned assets.  U.S.-owned assets abroad  U.S.-owned assets abroad increased $325.2 billion in
the first quarter, following an increase of $236.8 billion
in the fourth.  U.S. claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks and
securities brokers increased $89.3 billion in the first
quarter, following an increase of $94.6 billion in the
fourth.  (Examples of these claims are U.S.
banksüEdeposits at foreign banks and U.S. banksüEloans to
foreigners.)  Net U.S. purchases of foreign securities were $58.5
billion in the first quarter following net U.S. purchases
of $43.4 billion in the fourth.  Net U.S. purchases of
foreign stocks picked up to $49.0 billion from $28.7
billion, their strongest level since the third quarter of
2007. Net purchases of foreign bonds slowed to $9.5
billion from $14.7 billion.  (See Table 8a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=17) for the latest available statistics.)  U.S. direct investment abroad was $86.5 billion in
the first quarter, down from $93.0 billion in the fourth.
The decrease resulted from decreases in reinvested
earnings and in net intercompany debt investment.  A
decrease in equity inflows was partly offsetting.  (See
Table 7a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=9 
0730&table_id=18&area_id=3) for the latest available
statistics.)  U.S. claims on unaffiliated foreigners reported by
U.S. nonbanking concerns increased $86.8 billion in the
first quarter, following an increase of $5.7 billion in
the fourth.  U.S. official reserve assets increased $3.6 billion
in the first quarter, following a decrease of $0.2 billion
in the fourth. The first quarter increase resulted from an
increase in the U.S. reserve position in the  International
Monetary Fund .  U.S. government assets other than official reserve
assets increased $0.6 billion in the first quarter,
following an increase of $0.2 billion in the fourth.  Foreign-owned assets in the United States  Foreign-owned assets in the United States increased
$507.1 billion in the first quarter, following an increase
of $266.6 billion in the fourth.  U.S. liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S.
banks and securities brokers (other than foreign official
assets) increased $363.7 billion in the first quarter,
following an increase of $30.2 billion in the fourth.
(Examples of these liabilities are deposits of foreign
residents at banks in the United States and loans by banks
abroad to banks in the United States.) Most of the
increase was due to a pickup in liabilities for own
accounts. (See Table 11a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=14) for the latest available statistics.)  Net private foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury
securities were $3.5 billion in the first quarter, down
from $29.5 billion in the fourth.  Net private foreign sales of U.S. securities other
than U.S. Treasury securities were $7.2 billion in the
first quarter, a shift from net purchases of $48.4 billion
in the fourth. Net foreign sales of U.S. federally
sponsored agency bonds were $36.6 billion in the first
quarter, a shift from net purchases of $3.2 billion in the
fourth.  Net foreign sales of U.S. corporate bonds were
$4.6 billion, also a shift from net purchases of $8.2
billion.  Net foreign purchases of U.S. stocks decreased
to $33.9 billion from $37.1 billion.  (See Table 8a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=17) for the latest available statistics.)  Foreign direct investment in the United States was
$25.3 billion in the first quarter, following investment
of $70.6 billion in the fourth.  The largest contributors
to the decrease were a shift from inflows to outflows of
intercompany debt investment in the United States and a
slowing of equity inflows. Lower reinvested earnings also
contributed to the decrease.  (See Table 7a
( http://www.bea.gov/international/bp_web/simple.cfm?anon=7 
1&table_id=18&area_id=3) for the latest available
statistics.)  U.S. liabilities to unaffiliated foreigners reported
by U.S. nonbanking concerns increased $38.4 billion in the
first quarter, following an increase of $16.8 billion in
the fourth.  Foreign official assets in the United States
increased $70.9 billion in the first quarter, following an
increase of $57.8 billion in the fourth.  Net shipments of U.S. currency to foreign countries
were $12.6 billion in the first quarter, down from $13.4
billion in the fourth.  The statistical discrepancyùnet errors and omissions
in recorded transactionsùwas -$62.6 billion in the first
quarter compared with $82.8 billion in the fourth.  In the first quarter, the  U.S. dollar  depreciated
1.4 percent on a trade-weighted quarterly average basis
against a group of 7 major currencies.  (Data are based on
Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.10.)  Revisions  Statistics from the U.S. international transactions
accounts have been revised to incorporate several changes
in definitions and classifications, most of which result
from a multiyear effort to modernize and enhance BEA's
international economic accounts.  In addition, the
revisions reflect newly available source data and improved
estimating methodologies.  An article
( http://www.bea.gov/scb/toc/0511cont.htm ) in the May 2011
issue of the SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS describing this
effort is available on BEA's Web site.  Key changes
introduced in this annual revision are summarized below.  Definitions and classifications  * Receipts and payments for cruise fares are
reclassified within services from passenger  fares to travel beginning with statistics for 1999.
This change aligns the treatment of cruise  fares with that of similar expenditures related to
land travel, such as accommodations, meals,  and entertainment.  * Receipts and payments for the distribution rights
for film and television recordings are  reclassified within services from ôotherüEprivate
services to royalties and license fees  beginning with statistics   for 1999 to more closely
align with international guidelines.  * Receipts and payments for postal services are
reclassified within services from U.S.  government miscellaneous services to
ôotherüEtransportation beginning with statistics for  1999. This change is consistent with the
classification of government services transactions  according to the type of service performed.  * The recording of U.S. government income on holdings
and allocations of special drawing rights  (SDRs) is changed from a net basis to a gross basis
beginning with statistics for 2003.  Previously, income flows associated with U.S.
government holdings and allocations of SDRs were  included in ôU.S. government receiptsüEon a net
basis; that is, the amount recorded equaled  interest receipts on SDR holdings net of interest
payments on SDR allocations.  Interest receipts  are now recorded in ôU.S. government receipts,üEand
interest payments are now recorded in ôU.S.  government payments.üE  Source data and methodologies  * Exports and imports of goods on a balance of
payments basis are revised beginning with quarterly  statistics for 1999 to introduce new seasonally
adjusted balance of payments adjustmentsüE  adjustments that BEA applies to goods on a Census
basis to convert them to a balance of payments  basis.  Adjustments to low-value goods are
introduced for 1999-2006 and are revised for 2007-2009.  Adjustments for goods procured in ports by carriers
are revised for exports beginning with  statistics for 2007 and for imports beginning with
statistics for 2004.  Other significant  revisions to the adjustments, resulting from updated
source data, begin with statistics for 2008.  * Services receipts are revised beginning with
statistics for 1999 to implement an improved method  for measuring expenditures in the United States of
foreign residents who work in the United  States for less than one year and to exclude
expenditures of foreign nationals who work for  international organizations located in the United
States.  Services payments are revised  beginning with statistics for 2004 to incorporate an
improved method for measuring non-fuel  expenditures of U.S. air carriers in foreign ports.
Services receipts and payments are also  revised to incorporate updated source data,
including newly available data from BEAs quarterly  services surveys beginning with statistics for 2008
and initial results of BEAs benchmark  survey of international financial services
transactions beginning with statistics for 2007.  * For foreign securities, financial flows and interest
receipts for foreign bonds and dividend  receipts for foreign stocks are revised for 2009-
2010 to incorporate results of the U.S.  Treasury Departments annual survey of securities
claims for December 2009 and other new  source data.  * For U.S. securities, financial flows and interest
payments for U.S. corporate bonds, U.S.  Treasury bonds, and U.S. agency bonds and dividend
payments for U.S. stocks are revised for  2009-2010 to incorporate results of the U.S.
Treasury Departments annual survey of securities  liabilities for June 2010 and other new source data.  * Financial flows and related income payments are
revised for 2007-2010 to incorporate the  results of BEAs 2007 benchmark survey of foreign
direct investment in the United States  along with updated and revised quarterly and annual
data from BEAs surveys of foreign direct  investment in the United States.? Similarly,
financial flows and related income receipts are  revised for 2008-2010 to incorporate updated and
revised data from BEAs quarterly and annual  surveys of U.S. direct investment abroad.  The U.S. net international investment position
preliminary statistics for 2010 and revised statistics for
earlier years will be released on June 28.  The fourth-quarter 2010 international transactions
are revised from previously published statistics.  The
current-account deficit was revised down to $112.2 billion
from $113.3 billion. The goods deficit was revised up to
$159.2 billion from $156.2 billion; the services surplus
was revised up to $40.5 billion from $39.5 billion; the
income surplus was revised up to $39.9 billion from $38.6
billion; and unilateral current transfers were revised to
net outflows of $33.4 billion from $35.2 billion.  Net
financial inflows were revised to $29.3 billion from $32.4
billion.  *          *          *  Release dates in 2011:  Fourth quarter and year 2010.March 16, 2011 (Wednesday)
First quarter 2011..........June 16, 2011 (Thursday)
Second quarter 2011.........September 15, 2011 (Thursday)
Third quarter 2011..........December 15, 2011 (Thursday)  The statistics of the U. S. international transactions
accounts released today have been revised through the
fourth quarter of 2010.  The revisions reflect several
changes in definitions and classifications, part of a
multiyear effort to align the international transactions
accounts with new international statistical standards. For
example, cruise fares, previously classified in the
passenger fares category, have been reclassified to the
travel category.  (See the section on "Revisions" in this
release.)  The July SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS will contain tables
and an article describing revisions to the international
transactions accounts.  On June 28, BEA will release U.S.
net international investment position preliminary
statistics for 2010 and revised statistics for 2007-2009.
The release will also include a discussion of revisions to
those accounts.  A more detailed discussion of the U.S.
international investment position and the revisions of
those accounts will appear in the July SURVEY OF CURRENT
BUSINESS.  NOTE: This news release is available on BEAs Web site
