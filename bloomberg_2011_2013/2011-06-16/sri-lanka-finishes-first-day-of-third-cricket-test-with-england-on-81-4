Sri Lanka  was on 81-4 at the end  of
the first day of the rain-shortened third cricket Test with
England after losing several wickets in the early sessions.  Thilan Samaraweera was not out on 24 runs, and Prasanna
Jayawardene was on 10 after 38 overs in Southampton, England.
James Anderson and Chris Tremlett each took two wickets for the
hosts.  Sri Lanka lost two wickets and gained 6 runs in the five
overs after lunch, which was taken early because of rain.
Anderson, who just returned to England’s squad, took the wickets
of Lahiru Thirimanne, who was caught on 10, and  Kumar
Sangakkara , who was caught on 2. Tremlett got Tharanga
Paranavitana leg-before-wicket on 11, and Mahela Jayawardene was
caught on 4.  The start of play was delayed for an hour by rain this
morning, and England won the toss and put the visitors in to
bat.  England leads the three-Test series 1-0, after winning the
first match in Cardiff. The second Test, at Lord’s in  London ,
was drawn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
