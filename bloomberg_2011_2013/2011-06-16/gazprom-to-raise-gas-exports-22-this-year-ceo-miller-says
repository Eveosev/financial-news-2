(Corrects period after Gazprom press service says Miller
misspoke in headline, first paragraph of report published June
16.)  OAO Gazprom plans to boost gas
exports this year, after deliveries rose 22 percent in the first
five months, said Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Miller .  The Russian gas export monopoly increased total exports by
24 billion cubic meters in January through May, Miller said
today, while presenting Gazprom’s pipeline-management center to
Chinese President  Hu Jintao  and Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  in
Moscow. The company shipped 140 billion cubic meters of fuel to
 Europe  last year.  Gazprom, which supplies about a quarter of Europe’s gas,
benefited from unrest in  Libya  and  Japan ’s nuclear crisis.
Demand for Russian fuel has been climbing this year at an
increasing pace compared with a year earlier, Miller said last
month.  Exports to Europe, excluding former Soviet republics, may
reach 158 billion to 159 billion cubic meters this year, Deputy
CEO Alexander Medvedev told Bloomberg TV today at the St.
Petersburg International Economic Forum. “We are rather sure
exports will be more than predicted,” Medvedev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
