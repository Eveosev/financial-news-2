Israel ’s 10-year government bond
rose on speculation a below-forecast inflation rate in May will
lessen pressure on the Bank of Israel to raise  interest rates 
this month.  Annual inflation accelerated to 4.1 percent from 4 percent,
the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.
That was below the 4.2 percent median estimate of 14 analysts in
a Bloomberg poll. Central bank governor Stanley Fischer has
increased the benchmark lending rate four times this year in a
bid to curb rising prices.  “Some people thought the CPI might exceed expectations but
now that it wasn’t a surprise they’re expecting Fischer won’t
raise rates this month,” Sagie Poznerson, a bond trader at
Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by telephone.  The yield on the Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.19 percent at
the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  The shekel weakened 1.1 percent to 3.4753 per dollar at
4:52 p.m. The U.S. currency advanced against 13 of 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg as speculation the Greek debt
crisis is deteriorating damped demand for riskier assets.  Foreigners repositioning before the government cancels
their tax exemption on short-term government debt, a measure
that enters force on July 1, may be contributing to the shekel’s
decline, said  Jonathan Katz , a Jerusalem-based economist at HSBC
Holdings Plc.  The Israeli currency has dropped 1.9 percent this week,
trimming this year’s gain to 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
