Germany ’s federal and state
governments are unable to agree on common grounds for a banking
levy ahead of a parliament vote in the upper house tomorrow, the
newspaper  Handelsblatt  reported, citing unidentified officials.  Lawmakers haven’t been able to settle a dispute over
details of a subsequent-recovery period and can’t agree whether
banks’ annual losses should be allowed to offset profits in
subsequent or previous years, the newspaper said. The 16 states
are represented in the upper house.  To contact the reporter on this story:
