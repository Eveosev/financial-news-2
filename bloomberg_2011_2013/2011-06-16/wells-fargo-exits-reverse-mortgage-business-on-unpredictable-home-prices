Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, said it was exiting the business of reverse
mortgages because of the possibility that property values will
decline further, displacing as many as 1,000 employees.  “The decision was made based on today’s unpredictable
home values,” the San Francisco-based lender said today in a
statement distributed by  Business Wire .  Reverse mortgages allow retirees to create a lifetime
stream of income by tapping the equity in their homes. Lenders
are repaid from the sale of the home when the borrower dies or
moves. Bank of America Corp., the second-largest U.S. home
lender, said in February it was retreating from the business
because of “competing demands and priorities” at the
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based company.  “Why be in the reverse mortgage business if the equity that
you’re lending, your collateral, is disintegrating?” said Terry
Wakefield, a mortgage-industry consultant in Wisconsin.  Home prices  slid 3.6 percent in the first quarter to the
lowest level since 2003 in the S&P/Case-Shiller index of values
in 20 U.S. cities.  The 1,000 employees in the business are invited to apply
elsewhere in the company for jobs, according to the statement.  Wells Fargo will maintain its obligations on existing
reverse-mortgage contracts, without originating new deals. The
contracts represented about 1.2 percent of overall mortgage
volume as of 2010, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
