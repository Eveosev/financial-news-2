Sixty percent of 40 rich nations, or
parties, failed to meet a deadline for submitting a climate-
protection report, the  United Nations  said.  Twenty-four parties missed the deadline for so-called
“fifth national communications,” while 16 met it, according to
a draft document dated yesterday on the website of the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change. A climate panel overseen
by the convention “urged parties to submit their national
communications by the relevant due date in the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
