South Korea ’s Finance Minister Bahk
Jae Wan called for a “due and appropriate” process to select
the new managing director of the  International Monetary Fund .  Bahk told reporters in Seoul today that he hopes one of the
candidates from emerging countries will head the IMF someday,
according to Lee Jun Kyu, a senior adviser to the minister. The
government hasn’t decided whether to support French Finance
Minister Christine Lagarde or Mexican central bank Governor
Agustin Carstens, Bahk said, as both deserve the post given
their leadership, experience and capability.  Bahk’s predecessor Yoon Jeung Hyun said last month that he
believed that Lagarde, who contributed to the successful Group
of 20 nations summit in  Seoul  last year, was a good candidate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
