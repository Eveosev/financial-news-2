Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD) 
options prices soared to a record in the U.S. as investors
boosted bets that the Shanghai-based maker of mobile-phone chips
will extend losses.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money options expiring in 30 days has more than doubled in
the past two days to 218.20 as of 2:52 p.m. in New York. More
than 9,000 puts to sell changed hands, 5.3 times the four-week
full-day average and triple the number of calls to buy. The
shares slumped 5.3 percent to $12.77, heading for the lowest
close since October, and are down 44 percent since April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
