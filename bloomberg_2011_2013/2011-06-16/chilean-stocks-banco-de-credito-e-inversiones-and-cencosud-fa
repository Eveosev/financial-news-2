The following companies had unusual
price changes in Chilean trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:15 p.m. New York time.  The Ipsa index fell for a sixth day, down 0.9 percent to
4,530.70, its longest losing streak in almost four months.  Banco de Credito e Inversiones (BCI)  ,  Chile ’s fourth-
largest lender by assets, fell 4.5 percent to 29,037 pesos, its
lowest price in three months. Chilean banks agreed to extend
maturities on loans to  Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR)  from 30 to 90 days
if necessary, after the retailer detected consumer loan
irregularities that require additional provisions. BCI is La
Polar’s largest creditor bank, Diario Financiero wrote.  Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD CC),  Latin America ’s third-largest
retailer by sales, dropped 3.3 percent to 3,140.9 pesos, its
fifth day of losses. Chile’s government may modify retail
regulations after department store operator Empresas La Polar SA
said it may increase loan-loss provisions by up to $427 million
because of irregular credit practices, Deputy Finance Minister
Rodrigo Alvarez told reporters in Santiago today.  Other retailers also fell.  SACI Falabella (FALAB)  
retreated 4.5 percent to 4,508.3 pesos, the biggest decline in
15 weeks, while  Empresas Hites SA (HITES)   slumped 7.8 percent
to 518.07 pesos. Hites has fallen 24 percent this week, headed
for the biggest weekly decrease since its 2009 IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
