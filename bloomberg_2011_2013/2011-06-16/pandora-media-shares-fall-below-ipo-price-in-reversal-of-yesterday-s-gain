Pandora Media Inc., the online-radio
company, fell below its initial public offering price amid
concern it won’t grow fast enough to maintain the market value
gained yesterday on the first day of trading.  The Oakland, California-based company fell $1.67 to $15.75
as of 10:15 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
It earlier fell as much as 9.9 percent to $15.69.  Pandora’s increase on its debut gave it a $2.8 billion
market capitalization. That valued the unprofitable  Internet
company  at about 20 times last year’s sales, compared with about
2.7 times for  Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI) , a subscription-based
satellite-radio service that reached profitability last year.  “There’s probably froth there,” said  Jack Ablin , chief
investment officer at Chicago-based Harris  Private Bank , which
oversees about $60 billion and doesn’t hold Pandora.  Investors snapped up Pandora at its debut to take advantage
of the biggest surge in Internet share sales since the dot-com
boom a decade ago. A dozen Internet companies have gone public
this year, the most in any year since 2000, at the height of the
first wave of Web IPOs. Pandora also benefited from limiting the
number of shares available for purchase to about 9.2 percent of
those outstanding, compared with an average float of 24 percent
for U.S. technology IPOs in the past year.  “By restricting the offering, they’re creating a feeding
frenzy,” Ablin said. “That helps the buzz, whether or not those
valuations stay on the shares.”  Pandora sold 14.7 million shares at $16 apiece on June 14,
raising $234.9 million in its initial public offering. That was
above the top of the range of $10 to $12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
