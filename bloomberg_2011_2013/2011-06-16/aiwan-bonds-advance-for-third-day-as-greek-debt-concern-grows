Taiwan’s  government bonds  advanced,
pushing benchmark 10-year yields to a one-week low, as Europe’s
worsening debt crisis boosted demand for safer assets.  The debt gained for a third day and the island’s benchmark
stock index fell 2 percent after Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said he will reshuffle his Cabinet after attempts to
garner opposition support for the government’s austerity plan
failed. The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s general economic
index dropped to the lowest level since November. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg expected an increase.  “There’s a flight-to-safety bid for government bonds
because of the debt problem in Europe,” said Ivy Leung, a
Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Polaris Securities Co. “The
weak U.S. data drove a slump in stocks too, which caused money
to flow to debt.”  The yield on the 1.375 percent note due March 2021, the
most-traded security, dropped five basis points to 1.48 percent
as of the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  Taiwan ’s dollar weakened 0.5 percent to
NT$29.005 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. That’s the lowest level in three weeks.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, declined one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.33 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
