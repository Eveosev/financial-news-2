Kenya ’s budget deficit will widen to
8.8 percent of gross domestic project excluding grants in the
year through June 2012, said Henry Rotich, the Treasury’s deputy
director of economic affairs.  The  deficit  will expand from about 8.4 percent of GDP in
the current financial year, Rotich said in a phone interview
from Nairobi, the capital, today. Including grants, the
shortfall will be 7.4 percent of GDP in 2011-12, Finance
Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  in his budget speech on June 8.  Faster inflation and persistent fiscal deficits have pushed
up borrowing costs, with the yield on three-month Treasury bills
reaching a nine-year high of 9.016 percent at the last auction
on June 10. The country’s budget gap has widened every year
since at least 2005, the  International Monetary Fund  said in
April, with the overall debt rising to 48 percent of GDP from 39
percent in 2007-2008, according to the government.  “Our debt sustainability plan shows it’s still in a
manageable position,” Geoffrey Mwau, economic secretary in the
ministry of finance, said by phone yesterday.  The fiscal deficit excluding grants will narrow to 6.1
percent of GDP in 2012-2013 and 5 percent in 2013-2014,
according to the  finance ministry .  Lending Rates  The  Central Bank of Kenya  has increased the key lending
rate by a quarter of a percentage point at each of its last two
monetary policy meetings in March and May, pushing it to 6.25
percent in a bid to curb inflation.  Consumer prices  rose an
annual 13 percent in May, the fastest pace in 25 months.  “Until we bring down inflation you are going to see a
situation where the  interest rates  are high,” Mwau said from
Nairobi. “We’d like cheaper borrowing of course, including for
the government.”  The government plans to sell 83.7 billion shillings ($946
million) in Treasury bills and longer-dated bonds in 2011-2012,
down 11.5 percent from last year, and 35.9 billion shillings in
infrastructure bonds, according to a statement on the finance
ministry’s website. It sold securities to build roads and power
projects worth 30.5 billion shillings in 2010-2011.  Kenya has received commitments amounting to 35.3 billion
shillings in donations from abroad for “development projects,”
Kenyatta said on June 8, without providing a timeframe. External
grants are earmarked mainly for expansion of geothermal power
generation and road-building in Kenya, Rotich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
