The Bovespa stock index dropped for
a second day as traders raised bets for higher borrowing costs
and concern mounted that proposed international regulations  may
subject banks to capital surcharges if they grow any bigger.  The MSCI  Brazil /Financials Index fell the most in a week.
Online retailer B2W Cia. Global do Varejo slumped the most in
three months, leading losses by companies that depend on
domestic demand. Miner  Vale  SA followed metal prices lower.  The Bovespa index fell 1.2 percent to 60,880.62 at the
close of  Sao Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. Fifty-one
stocks declined on the index, while 16 advanced. The real
weakened 0.3 percent to 1.6050 per  U.S. dollar . Brazil’s
benchmark equity gauge is approaching a so-called  bear market 
after falling 17 percent from a November peak amid concern
quickening inflation will hurt economic growth.  “The markets reacted badly to the changes proposed by the
Basel committee,” said Alvaro Bandeira, a director of Rio de
Janeiro-based brokerage Ativa Corretora, in a telephone
interview.  Draft plans circulated before a meeting next week of the
 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  would subject banks to a
sliding scale depending on their size and links to other
lenders, said two people familiar with the matter, who declined
to be identified because the proposals aren’t public. Banks
wouldn’t initially face the highest surcharge, which is intended
as a deterrent to expansion, one person said. The largest banks
may face a 3 percentage point levy at their current sizes, the
person said.  Volatility Index  The CBOE Brazil ETF Volatility Index, a gauge of the cost
of using options as insurance against declines in the iShares
MSCI Brazil Index exchange-traded fund, rose 10 percent to a
record-high 31.45.  Brazil’s central bank said today it will continue with its
strategy of raising  interest rates  for a “sufficiently long”
period, even as the country’s inflation outlook shows signs of
improving, according to minutes of the June 7-8 policy meeting.  Policy makers raised the benchmark Selic target rate by a
quarter point to 12.25 percent on June 8, continuing a strategy
they began in April of tightening rates at a slower pace than
earlier in the year.  The MSCI/Brazil Financials Index fell 1.7 percent to
883.39, the biggest drop since June 6, after earlier tumbling
3.3 percent. Banco do Brasil SA fell 2 percent to 27.05 reais.  Metals prices tracked by the Bloomberg Forward Global Base
Metal Index dropped 0.5 percent to 253.54. Vale slid 1.1 percent
to 42.78 reais.  Economic Data  B2W Varejo tumbled 4.3 percent to 20.24 reais.  The Bovespa earlier gained as much as 0.7 percent after a
report showed jobless claims in the U.S. declined by 16,000 to
414,000 in the week ended June 11, Labor Department figures
showed today in  Washington . Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
projected 420,000 filings, according to the median forecast.  The Bovespa index trades at 10 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, the lowest since January 2009, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 12.5 for
the Shanghai Composite Index, 6.6 for  Russia ’s Micex and 14.8
for  India ’s Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
