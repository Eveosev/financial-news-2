Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
fell by the most in three months as the euro weakened against
the yen on mounting concern Greece will default on its debt and
after reports showed the  U.S. economy  is cooling.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, lost 1.7
percent.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s biggest commodities trader,
retreated 2.8 percent after crude and metal prices dropped.
Mitsui Fudosan Co., Japan’s largest developer by sales, slumped
3.6 percent after the supply of new condominiums offered in
Tokyo rose less-than-expected following March’s earthquake.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.7 percent to 9,411.28 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, the most since March 15, after rioting against
austerity measures in  Greece  threatened the country’s government
and fueled speculation that budget cuts needed to qualify for
international aid will be put in jeopardy. The broader Topix
index declined 1.5 percent to 812.41.  “Investors have no choice but to take a wait-and-see
stance on buying new risk assets,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a
senior strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management
Co., which oversees the equivalent of $84 billion. “There’s
concern Greece’s debt problem will eventually damage the global
financial system and the U.S. economy is slowing.”  Quake, Tsunami  The Topix has tumbled 13 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, triggering the worst nuclear accident in 25
years, disrupting supply chains, and leaving almost 24,000
people dead or missing.  Markets across Asia fell today amid concern a Greek default
will cause a freeze in credit markets worldwide, similar to the
one in 2008 when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the region’s key index, fell 2.2
percent, headed for its lowest close since March 18.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  last night sought to
reassert his authority in a televised address after police used
tear gas to break up protests in central Athens. Papandreou will
name a new government today and call a vote of confidence in
parliament as he seeks to pressure opposition lawmakers to back
an austerity plan aimed at securing a new bailout.  “Greece could have a contagion effect,” European Central
Bank Vice President  Vitor Constancio  said at a briefing in
Frankfurt yesterday, presenting the bank’s semi-annual Financial
Stability Review. “That’s the reason why we are against any
sort of default with haircuts and any form of private-sector
event that could lead to a  credit event  or a rating event.”  Debt Clash  European officials have so far failed to agree on a rescue
plan for Greece. The ECB and the German government have clashed
over how much investors should contribute to alleviating
Greece’s debt load, which reached 143 percent of gross domestic
product in 2010.  The yen appreciated to 113.95 against the euro today, a
level not seen since May 23, from 116.04 at the close of  stock
trading  in Tokyo yesterday. A stronger yen reduces the value of
repatriated sales for Japanese exporters.  Toyota declined 1.7 percent to 3,195 yen.  Advantest Corp. (6857) ,
the No. 1 maker of chip-testing equipment, fell 2.2 percent to
1,411 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets more than 80
percent of its revenue outside Japan, dropped 1.8 percent to
3,740 yen.  In the U.S., a report showed manufacturing in the  New York 
region unexpectedly shrank in June, a sign industry still faces
parts shortages following Japan’s earthquake disaster. Another
report showed confidence among U.S. homebuilders slumped this
month to the lowest level since September.  Commodities Fall  Oil and raw-material related shares dropped after crude and
metal prices fell. Mitsubishi retreated 2.8 percent to 1,936 yen.
Mitsui & Co., Japan’s second-largest trading company, slumped
3.5 percent to 1,283 yen, while  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s biggest
energy exploration company, lost 3.8 percent to 565,000 yen.  Crude oil for July delivery tumbled 4.6 percent to $94.81 a
barrel in New York yesterday, the lowest settlement since Feb.
22. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six metals,
including copper and aluminum, dropped 0.8 percent.  Real estate companies dropped after a report showed that
3,914 new condominiums went on sale in greater Tokyo last month,
fewer than the forecasted 5,500 units. Developers delayed
listings on concern consumer confidence near a two-year low and
radiation leaks from a crippled nuclear power plant 220
kilometers (135 miles) north of the capital will discourage
buyers.  Mitsui Fudosan, declined 3.6 percent to 1,297 yen.
Mitsubishi Estate Co., the second-biggest developer by sales,
lost 2.6 percent to 1,330 yen. Sumitomo Realty & Development Co.,
the No. 3, dropped 2.4 percent to 1,638 yen.  “Investors are getting defensive,” said  Mitsushige Akino ,
who oversees about $600 million at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. in  Tokyo . “We can’t be optimistic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
