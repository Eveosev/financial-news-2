Mozambique began a third
international tender for hydrocarbon blocks in the Maniamba
basin in the northwestern Niassa province, Noticias reported,
citing National Petroleum Institute Chairman Arsenio Mabote.  The Maputo-based newspaper didnâ€™t provide further details.  The Maniamba area has evidence of coal outcrops and there
may be the potential for gas in the area, according to the
website of Deloitte Petroleum Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
