Negotiations on a ceasefire in
Sudan’s Southern Kordofan state will start immediately, said
 Thabo Mbeki , a former president of South Africa and head of the
African Union’s High-Level Implementation Panel.  “I doubt we are a long way” from a ceasefire, Mbeki told
reporters in  Addis Ababa , Ethiopia’s capital, after visiting the
area. Both north and Southern Sudan agree that a halt to the
conflict is important, Mbeki said.  Talks on a ceasefire in the disputed border region of Abyei
are “almost at a point of concluding,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
