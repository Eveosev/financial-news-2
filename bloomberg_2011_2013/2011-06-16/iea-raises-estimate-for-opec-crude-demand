The  International Energy Agency 
boosted its forecast for the amount of crude that will be needed
from OPEC this year as supply growth outside the group slows.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries must
provide an average of 30.1 million barrels a day in 2011, the
IEA said today in its monthly market report, or 400,000 a day
more than it estimated last month. OPEC failed to agree an
output target when it met on June 8. Demand for the group’s oil
in the third quarter is about 1.5 million barrels a day more
than May production levels and there are “reassuring signs”
members will boost output, the IEA said.  “There is a clear need for the organization to boost
supply,” the Paris-based adviser said. “There are reassuring
signs that  Saudi Arabia  and some other producers will rise to
the challenge. Without such positive developments, there is a
risk” of “damaging implications” for the global economy.  Brent crude futures have advanced 20 percent this year,
trading today at $113 a barrel in London, as world consumption
increases and conflict halts exports from  Libya , holder of
 Africa ’s largest reserves. Saudi Arabia said June 8 that it and
three other Persian Gulf exporters will keep markets adequately
supplied in the absence of a collective OPEC pledge to do so.  The agency boosted its global oil demand forecasts for this
year and last. World crude consumption will rise by 1.3 million
barrels a day to 89.3 million a day in 2011, or 100,000 a day
more than the IEA predicted last month. It raised demand
projections for 2010 by an equivalent amount.  Call-on-OPEC  The 12 OPEC members pumped 29.18 million barrels a day last
month, or 210,000 a day more than in April, according to the
agency. The increase in May was led by Saudi Arabia, which
produced 9 million barrels a day. The so-called call-on-OPEC, or
the amount needed to balance world supply and demand, during the
third quarter is estimated at 30.7 million a day.  Disruptions in the  North Sea , North and  South America  and
Yemen prompted the IEA to reduce its forecast for non-OPEC
production in 2011 by 400,000 barrels a day to 53.3 million a
day. That means supply from outside OPEC will expand by 560,000
barrels a day this year, or about half the amount of 2010.  The IEA is an adviser on  energy policy  to 28 nations in the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Oil stockpiles held by companies in OECD nations jumped by
34.5 million barrels to 2.67 billion in April, the agency said.
That is equivalent to 59.1 days worth of consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
