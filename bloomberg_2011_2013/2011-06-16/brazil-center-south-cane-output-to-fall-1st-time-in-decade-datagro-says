Brazil ’s Center South, the world’s
largest sugar-producing region, will have declining cane output
for the first time in 10 years on lower yields, said the head of
industry researcher Datagro Ltd.  Cane is expected to drop 4 percent to 536 million tons from
a year ago, while sugar output declines to 33.7 million tons,
down from a May 18 estimate of 34.7 million tons. Brazil’s
regional output forecasts were reduced on low yields, President
Plinio Nastari told reporters in Sao Paulo today.  Brazil’s Center-South region will produce 23.24 billion
liters of ethanol this year, compared with a previous forecast
of 24.1 billion liters. It will turn 47 percent of cane into
sugar as it’s more profitable to produce sugar than ethanol, he
said.  The region produces about 90 percent of the South American
country’s sugar and ethanol.  Sugar loading backlogs at Brazil’s six main sugar ports are
expected to last an additional 20 to 30 days, Nastari said.  Datagro sees a global sugar surplus of 2.7 million tons for
October 2010-September 2011, and an excess of 6.5 million tons
in October 2011-September 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
