Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s fourth-biggest airline, returned to profit for the year
ending in March as seat capacity returned to levels seen before
a global economic crisis hindered travel to the island.  Net income rose to 10.1 million euros ($14.3 million) from
a loss of 6.2 million euros a year earlier, the Port Louis-based
airline said in a statement handed to reporters today. It
carried 14 percent more passengers during the period at 1.3
million, it said.  “These results have been obtained in spite of many
challenges,” Andre Viljoen, the carrier’s officer in charge,
told reporters. That includes higher fuel prices, natural
disasters and a “challenging” economic recovery in Europe, the
airline’s main market.  Air Mauritius stock snapped four days of gains, retreating
0.5 percent to 20.4 rupees by the 1:30 p.m. close in  Port Louis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
