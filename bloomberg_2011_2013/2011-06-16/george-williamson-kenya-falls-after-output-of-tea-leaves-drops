George Williamson Kenya Ltd. (GWKL) , a tea
grower, fell to its lowest in almost a week after tea production
slipped in  Kenya , the world’s largest grower of the black
variety of the leaves.  The stock dropped 5.2 percent to 200 shillings by 1 p.m. in
Nairobi today.  Tea production in Kenya fell 12 percent in April to 31,482
metric tons from a year earlier, the Kenya National Bureau of
Statistics said yesterday.  “The rains haven’t been as robust as they need to be, so
that is affecting the overall view of tea production for the
next few months,” Irene Muigai, an equity trader with Sterling
Investment Bank in Nairobi, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
