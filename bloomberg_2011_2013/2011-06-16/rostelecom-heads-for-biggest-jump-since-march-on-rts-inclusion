OAO Rostelecom was poised for its
strongest advance in 2 1/2 months after the shares’ inclusion in
the RTS Index came into effect.  Russia ’s dominant long-distance phone company gained 4.6
percent to 174 rubles as of 5:24 p.m. in Moscow on Russia’s
benchmark Micex Index, headed for the the biggest jump since
March 25. The Micex slid 0.8 percent to 1,665.36, its fourth day
of declines. The shares advanced 1.9 percent to $5.50 when they
last traded on the dollar-denominated RTS on June 1.  RTS included Rostelecom’s shares in its index as of today,
the exchange said in a  statement  on its website June 1.  “All passive indexers which follow the RTS Index must add
Rostelecom to their positions, driving up the share price,”
