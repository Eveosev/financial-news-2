Brent crude  will stay “well above”
$100 a barrel in the second half of this year on  China ’s oil
demand growth and reduced supply of high-quality grades,
according to Mirae Asset Securities Ltd.  China consumed more than 9 million barrels a day of fuel in
May for a seventh month and will probably delay domestic fuel-
price increases to tame inflation, said  Gordon Kwan , Mirae’s
head of regional energy research in  Hong Kong . Brent futures
have averaged more than $111 a barrel in London trading so far
this year, from $80.33 in 2010, beating the broker’s full-year
forecast of $100.  “Bullish economic headlines in China have vindicated our
conviction call for a soft economic landing, which bodes well
for sustained higher  oil prices ,” Kwan said in an e-mailed note
today. “Brisk demand persisted even though growth in the
world’s largest energy-consuming country is slowing.”  Brent has rallied more than 20 percent this year as an
uprising against Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi disrupted supply
from the country, holder of Africa’s largest crude reserves.
China on June 14 said industrial production rose 13.3 percent in
May and inflation climbed 5.5 percent, the quickest pace since
2008. Brent contracts on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, which topped $127 a barrel in April, traded today near
$114.  Asian Refiners  Brent has risen on Libya’s unrest and reduced production of
high-quality crude in the North Sea, and as Royal Dutch Shell
Plc halted shipments of Bonny Light from Nigeria, according to
Mirae. This will favor so-called “complex” refiners in South
Korea and India that can process lower-quality grades pegged to
other crude benchmarks such as Dubai, including  S-Oil Corp. (010950)  and
 GS Holdings (078930)  Corp., it said.  China, which subsidizes domestic fuel prices, will need to
raise prices by about 20 percent this year to maintain a 5
percent profit for refiners assuming Brent averages $100 a
barrel, Kwan said. The country, which was reported to have
boosted jet-fuel prices last month, is “behind the curve” in
increasing rates, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
