BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, the largest French
bank, hired Aidan Clegg from  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  as a managing
director within its investment banking unit in London, according
to three people familiar with the matter.  Clegg, who was co-head of European industrials at Nomura in
London, left the Japanese bank last week and wasn’t immediately
available for comment. A spokesman for Nomura in London
confirmed his departure without elaborating further. Officials
at BNP Paribas declined to comment.  Clegg’s co-head of European industrials, Nick Tansley, left
Nomura to become a managing director at Citigroup Inc.’s global
industrials group this month.  BNP’s corporate and investment banking unit, which has
about 20,000 employees, is expanding its advisory unit in  Europe 
and last month hired Credit Suisse Group AG’s Torsten Murke as
head of investment banking for Germany.  To contact the reporters on this story:
