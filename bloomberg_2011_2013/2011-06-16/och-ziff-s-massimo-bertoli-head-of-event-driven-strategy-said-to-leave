Massimo Bertoli, who ran event-
driven investing at Och-Ziff Capital Management Group, left the
hedge fund, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Bertoli, who was based in  London , left with colleague
Riccardo La Villa, said the person who asked not to be
identified because the information is private.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for New York-based Och-
Ziff, declined to comment on the departures, which were earlier
reported by Reuters. Bertoli couldn’t be reached on his cell
phone.  Event-driven funds invest in companies undergoing
transactions such as mergers or spinoffs. Och-Ziff manages about
$30 billion, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
