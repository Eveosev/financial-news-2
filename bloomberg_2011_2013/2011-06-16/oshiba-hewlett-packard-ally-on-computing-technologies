Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the world’s second-
largest maker of flash-memory chips, allied with  Hewlett-Packard
Co. (HPQ)  to develop cloud-computing technologies for “smart-
community” businesses.  The companies plan to jointly develop technologies that can
share data on social infrastructure including water supply,
transportation, telecommunications, medical and public-service
systems, contributing to energy conservation, Toshiba said in a
statement today.  The Tokyo-based company forecast sales in its smart-
community business, including grid and building facilities, will
triple to 900 billion yen ($11 billion) in the year ending March
2016. Toshiba said it created a business unit in October to
oversee smart-community operations.  Toshiba fell 0.3 percent to 406 yen as of 9:41 a.m. on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange and  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average retreated 0.9 percent. Hewlett-Packard, the world’s
biggest maker of personal computers, lost 1.4 percent to $34.26
at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
