European Union carbon permits fell
to their lowest price since March 11 as traders expressed
concern over plans to boost security in the market.  EU futures for December fell 0.9 percent to close at 16.10
euros ($22.81) a ton on the ICE Futures exchange. The price was
the lowest since an earthquake in  Japan  on March 11 prompted the
Fukushima nuclear disaster.  Carbon permit prices have declined since reaching 18.18
euros on May 31 as traders wait for signs that German utilities
are replacing nuclear-generated electricity with fossil-fuel
power.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said last month that eight
German nuclear plants shut in the wake of the Fukushima disaster
will remain permanently closed, and the remaining nine plants
will all close by 2022.  A European Commission plan to protect transfers of permits
and remove serial numbers “does not provide enough certainty”
and is opposed by “many” unspecified member states,  Miles Austin , director of the Carbon Markets & Investors’ Association,
said today in an e-mailed statement. “The underlying risk of
potentially facing legal consequences when unknowingly handling
stolen allowances or credits is not appropriately addressed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
