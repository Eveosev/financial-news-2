Copper fell for the sixth time in
seven sessions on concern that  Greece ’s debt crisis may damp
global economic growth, curbing demand for industrial metals.  European Union officials failed to reach agreement on a new
bailout for Greece to prevent the first euro-area default,
sparking a global rout in equities and sending the euro lower
against the dollar. Copper has dropped 11 percent from a record
$4.6575 a pound on Feb. 15 as manufacturing slowed in China, the
world’s largest metal buyer.  “It is clear that the trend is downward for the economies
and for the base metals as a result,”  Dennis Gartman , an
economist, said in his Gartman Letter. “We need to sell base
metals.”  Copper futures for September delivery dropped 0.3 cent, or
0.1 percent, to close at $4.136 a pound at 1:22 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York .  Yesterday, the dollar jumped the most since August against
a basket of major currencies, eroding the appeal of commodities
as an alternative investment.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months declined $89, or 1 percent, to $9,065 a metric ton ($4.11
a pound).  “The commodity markets will be closely watching the
goings-on in the euro zone over the next few days,”  Edward Meir , a senior analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Darien,
Connecticut, said in a report. Support at $9,000 “will
eventually give way,” Meir said.  Lead, aluminum, zinc, nickel and tin also dropped in
London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
