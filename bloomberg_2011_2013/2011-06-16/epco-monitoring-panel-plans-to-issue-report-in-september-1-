The committee set up to monitor
 Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s finances will issue a report to
 Japan ’s government in September, including a possible
recommendation to break up the company’s distribution and
generation operations.  The committee held its first meeting today and will
reconvene next week to set its agenda, after failing to agree a
schedule, the panel’s chairman, Kazuhiko Shimokobe, told
reporters in Tokyo. Committee members will also meet with Tokyo
Electric executives to investigate its finances.  The panel also plans to outsource due diligence on the
utility’s assets and will seek bidders for the assessment,
according to Shimokobe.  The Japanese government set up the panel as part of
compensation plans for those affected by the crippled Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, at the center of the worst nuclear
crisis in 25 years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
