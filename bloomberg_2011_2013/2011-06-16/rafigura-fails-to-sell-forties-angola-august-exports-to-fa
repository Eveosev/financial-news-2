Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell
North Sea Forties for the second day even after it lowered the
offer price. Royal Dutch Shell Plc sought to sell Russian Urals
in the Mediterranean without success.  Angola  will reduce daily crude exports by 6.5 percent in
August from a month earlier, according to a preliminary loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Trafigura failed to sell one cargo of Forties for July 6 to
July 8 at 28 cents a barrel above Dated Brent, compared with a
premium of 40 cents it offered yesterday, according to a survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window.  Shell didn’t manage to buy a consignment for July 2 to July
4 at a premium of 35 cents to Dated Brent or a shipment for July
6 to July 8 at 10 cents above the benchmark, the survey showed.  Reported  North Sea  market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days cost 53 cents more
than Dated Brent, compared with 60 cents yesterday, according to
Bloomberg data.  Brent for August settlement traded at $113.84 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the
window, down from $117.78 yesterday. The September contract was
at $113.45, 39 cents less than August.  Statoil ASA,  Norway ’s largest oil company, will shut part
of its Statfjord fields in the North Sea for maintenance in
August and September, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Mediterranean/Urals  Shell failed to sell 140,000 metric tons of Urals in the
Mediterranean for June 26 to June 30 delivery at $2.50 a barrel
below Dated Brent, while Vitol was unable to sell the same
amount for June 26 to June 30 at $2.70 less than Dated Brent,
according to the survey.  No bids or offers were made for Urals in northwest  Europe .
Yesterday BP bought 100,000 tons of Urals for June 25 to June 29
delivery from Shell at $2.55 a barrel below Dated Brent.  West Africa  Angola plans to ship 49.1 million barrels or 1.58 million
barrels a day in August, compared with a revised 52.5 million or
1.69 million barrels a day in July, the program showed. The
number of cargoes planned will total 51 in August versus 55 a
month earlier.  Shipping schedules for Nigerian crude are expected to be
released next week, said traders involved in the transactions of
the region’s oil.  Indian Oil Corp. is scheduled to award the second spot
tender for crude oil for loading in August tomorrow. Last week,
the company bought 4 million barrels of Nigerian grades for
