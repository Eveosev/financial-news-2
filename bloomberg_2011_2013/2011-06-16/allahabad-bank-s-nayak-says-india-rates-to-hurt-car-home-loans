     June 16 (Bloomberg) --- M.R. Nayak, executive director at
 Allahabad Bank (ALBK) , a state-run Indian lender, comments on lending
and deposit rates after the  Reserve Bank  of India today raised
its benchmark repurchase rate to 7.5 percent from 7.25 percent.  “Credit growth among retail clients is likely to slow,
especially vehicle and housing loans. Since this is repo rate
increase, the impact will be known only after 35 to 40 days.  ‘‘I don’t think there will be further increase in lending
or deposit rates as credit demand is not up to the mark. Deposit
rates may stabilize or even come down. If cash reserve ratio
rate goes up, then banks may think of increasing lending rates.  ‘‘Economic growth will stabilize at about 8.25 percent to
8.5 percent because agriculture growth was good last year. It is
likely that  agriculture sector  is driving growth for India.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
