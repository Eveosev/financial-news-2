European stocks were little changed
after Federal Reserve minutes showed U.S. policy makers are
divided over whether to maintain record stimulus past June, and
banks announced plans to raise capital. Asian shares fell and
U.S. index futures gained.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA advanced 2.8 percent as  Italy ’s second-
biggest bank said it will seek as much as 5 billion euros ($7.1
billion) to strengthen capital.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose less than 0.1 percent to
281.24 at 8:04 a.m. in  London . The benchmark has advanced 7.3
percent from this year’s low on March 16 as investors speculated
that the economic recovery will withstand Japan’s worst
earthquake on record and popular revolts in the Middle East and
north Africa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
