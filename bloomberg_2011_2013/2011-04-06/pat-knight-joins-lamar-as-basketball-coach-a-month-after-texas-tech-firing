Pat Knight was hired as the head
men’s basketball coach at Lamar University a month after being
fired by Texas Tech University.  Knight, 40, replaces Steve Roccaforte, who was fired by
Lamar after going 76-78 in five years with the Cardinals. The
Beaumont, Texas, school finished 13-17 overall and 7-9 in the
Southland Conference last season.  “After a very thorough search across the entire country,
we have found the perfect fit for Lamar University in Pat
Knight,” Lamar Athletics Director Larry Tidwell said yesterday
on the school’s website. “Pat will be extremely important to
Lamar University, not only on the court, but throughout the
community.”  Knight becomes the 10th men’s basketball coach at Lamar
since the university became a four-year institution in 1951.  “It’s an opportunity to build my own program and hopefully
establish my own legacy,” Knight said in the school’s
statement.  Knight compiled a 50-61 record with the Red Raiders in just
over three seasons as head coach and led the Lubbock-based
school to a 19-16 mark last season. He spent 10 seasons at Texas
Tech and took over as head coach from his Hall of Fame father,
 Bob Knight , at the end of the 2007-08 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
