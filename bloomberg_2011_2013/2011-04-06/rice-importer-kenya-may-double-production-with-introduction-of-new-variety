Kenya , a net rice importer, may
double production of the grain over the next seven years after
introducing a drought-resistant seed variety that thrives in
drier environments, the Agriculture Ministry said.  The government is encouraging use of the seed type, known
as New Rice for  Africa , or Nerica, which may increase output to
178,000 metric tons by 2018 from 80,000 tons, Johnson Irungu,
director of crops at the ministry, said in a phone interview
yesterday from Nairobi, the capital. So far, about 60 tons of
the seed has been distributed, he said.  “This is very low, but we hope that farmers will soon
embrace this rice variety,” he said.  Kenya, with a population of 38 million people, consumes
300,000 tons of rice a year, according to the ministry. The
shortfall is made up of imports from countries including
Pakistan, Thailand, Uganda and Tanzania. The grain is Kenya’s
third-biggest staple food, after corn and wheat.  The government has distributed Nerica seeds in the central
Mwea area, which produces 80 percent of Kenya’s rice, as well as
farmers in the eastern Coastal and western Nyanza provinces
under an 8.5 million-shilling ($100,000) program. Nerica yields
as much as 5 tons per hectare (2.5 acres), compared with 1.5 to
2 tons produced by domestic varieties on the same size of plot.  Last year, Kenya received a 12.1 billion-shilling loan from
 Japan  to build an irrigation system to boost rice production.
The funds were aimed at helping Kenya meet its target of
irrigating 30,000 hectares of farmland annually, the Water
Ministry said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
