Canadian stocks fell from a 33-month
high as banks dropped and oil producers declined on concern that
environmental rules will limit oil-sands production.  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) ,  Canada ’s fifth-biggest energy company,
lost 1.6 percent after the province of  Alberta  announced plans
to set aside land for conservation.  National Bank of Canada (NA) , the
country’s sixth-largest lender by assets, slipped 1.4 percent
after Bank of Nova Scotia cut its rating. Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest fertilizer producer by
market value, fell 2.6 percent after Monsanto Co. reported a
drop in agricultural-chemical earnings.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 85.69
points, or 0.6 percent, to 14,208.01 at 11:28 a.m. in Toronto,
after closing at the highest level since June 2008 yesterday.  “Every time when you have the market level bump up against
a previous high, people get nervous,” said Marcus Xu, who helps
manage C$1.7 billion ($1.8 billion) as director of equity
investments at Genus Capital Management in  Vancouver . “The
psychology of investors is people remember the most-recent
painful experience, so if you had a couple of stocks that went
down 5 to 6 percent, you remember that.’”  The equity benchmark had gained each of the previous six
days, advancing 2.7 percent during the period. S&P/TSX raw-
materials companies surged 6.3 percent as gold climbed on demand
for a haven from global instability and from inflation concerns,
while Minmetals Resources Ltd. launched a takeover bid for
Equinox Minerals Ltd.  Conservation Plan  Energy stocks retreated after Alberta proposed setting
aside 20 percent of its oil-sands area for conservation. The
area includes land belonging to companies including Cenovus and
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , the Globe & Mail  reported .  Cenovus decreased 1.6 percent to C$37.79. Suncor, Canada’s
largest oil and gas producer, lost 1.4 percent to C$42.98.
Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., the largest owner of the Syncrude
project, slipped 1.5 percent to C$32.62.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , which produces oil in
 Colombia , advanced 3.5 percent to C$29.11 after saying it will
buy back as much as 4.3 percent of its outstanding shares in the
12 months beginning April 8.  The S&P/TSX Banks Index fell for a second day after
climbing to the highest price in 11 months relative to earnings.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender by
assets, dropped 0.9 percent to C$59.77.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,
its biggest domestic rival, slipped 0.6 percent to C$84.74.  Rating Cut  National Bank lost 1.4 percent to C$78.04 after Kevin R. Choquette, an analyst at Scotiabank, cut his rating on the
shares to “sector underperform” from “sector perform.”  Potash Corp. fell 2.8 percent to C$57.47 after Monsanto
reaffirmed a 2011 profit forecast that trails the average
analyst estimate.  Nevsun Resources Ltd. (NSU) , which began gold production in
 Africa  in February, advanced for a sixth day, rallying 4.8
percent to C$6.33 after saying its mine now turns out 1,000
ounces a day.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest
publicly traded copper producer jumped 3.2 percent from a record
close to C$144.52. Total output from a new copper-producing
region in Zambia may reach 1 million metric tons a year by 2014.
Company President  Clive Newall  spoke today at a conference in
Santiago.  Westport Innovations Inc. (WPT) , which makes natural-gas engines,
increased 4.5 percent to C$25.77 after Laurence Alexander, an
analyst at Jefferies Group Inc., raised his rating on the stock
to “buy” from “hold.” More fleets are likely to add natural-
gas vehicles in 2012-13, Alexander wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story;
