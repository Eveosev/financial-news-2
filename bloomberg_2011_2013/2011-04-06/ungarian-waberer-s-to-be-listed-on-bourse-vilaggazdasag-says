Private-equity fund Mid Europa
Partners plans to sell its stake in the Hungarian road freight
transportation company Waberer’s Holding Zrt. on the Budapest
Stock Exchange in three to five years,  Vilaggazdasag  reported.  The fund, which last month purchased a 49.05 percent stake
in the company, plans its investments on a three- to five-year
