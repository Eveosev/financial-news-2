India ’s rupee strengthened to a
five-month high as overseas investors increased purchases of the
nation’s assets to benefit from economic growth.  Funds based abroad added $915 million to holdings of Indian
equities on April 4, the biggest single-day purchase since
November, according to data published yesterday by the
Securities & Exchange Board of India. The government forecast
Feb. 28 that the $1.3 trillion economy will expand as much as
9.25 percent in the financial year that started April 1, the
most since 2008.  “Of late, the capital inflows have been huge and that is
positive for the rupee,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager
at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “There is a global acceptance
that India is a growing economy.”  The rupee climbed 0.4 percent to 44.245 per dollar as of
9:45 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency earlier touched 44.23, the strongest level since
Nov. 8, and has appreciated 1 percent this year.  Foreign investors raised stock holdings by $1.56 billion in
March, the most in four months, according to the Securities &
Exchange Board.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.93 in
three months, compared with expectations of 45.11 yesterday.
