German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government wants to put Hamburg-registered Europaeisch-Iranische
Handelsbank AG on a list of groups subject to European Union
sanctions, Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing
government officials it didn’t name.  There’s increasing indications of “proliferation-related
activity” at EIHB and attempts to bypass sanctions, the
Hamburg-based newspaper cited the officials as saying. The
German government is also looking into possible illegal
activities by EIHB’s owners, the newspaper said.  A management board secretary at EIHB in Hamburg declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
