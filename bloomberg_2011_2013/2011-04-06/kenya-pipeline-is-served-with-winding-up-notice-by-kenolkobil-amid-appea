Kenya Pipeline Co., the state-owned
utility, said it was served with a winding-up notice by
KenolKobil Ltd. amid a dispute between the two companies over an
arbitral award.  Kenya Pipeline is “taking steps to defend what is clearly
a misconceived” course of action, the Nairobi-based company
said in a statement published in the Daily Nation newspaper
today.  Charles Njogu, a spokesman for KenolKobil, said in a phone
interview he would comment on Kenya Pipeline’s statement later
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
