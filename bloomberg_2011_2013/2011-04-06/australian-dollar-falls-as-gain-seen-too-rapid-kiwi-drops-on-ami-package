The Australian dollar fell after
reaching a record against the greenback as an earthquake shook
 Japan  less than a month after the nation’s worst temblor on
record, damping demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Aussie earlier strengthened against 10 of its 16 most-
traded peers after government data showed the jobless rate
unexpectedly dropped as employers added more jobs than forecast.
 New Zealand ’s currency fell after the government said it will
provide financial support for AMI Insurance Ltd. following the
Christchurch earthquakes.  “When we break these post-float highs, it’s hard to find a
top or resistance level in the Aussie,” said Eric Viloria,
senior currency strategist at Gain Capital LLC in  New York .
“Because we had news about the earthquake, the market had a
reason to take risk off the table.” Resistance is a level where
orders to sell a currency may be clustered.  Australia ’s dollar was little changed at $1.0446 at 12:32
p.m. in New York from $1.0441 yesterday. It earlier touched
$1.0508, the highest since it was freely floated in 1983. It
traded at 88.75 yen from 89.26 yen.  New Zealand’s currency weakened 0.4 percent to 77.65 U.S.
cents from 77.95 cents yesterday and fell 1 percent to 65.98
yen.  Quake Warning  A magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit 215 miles (345 kilometers)
northeast of  Tokyo , resulting in warnings of a possible tsunami.  The number of people employed in Australia rose by 37,800,
rebounding from a revised decline of 8,600 in February, the
statistics bureau said in Sydney today. That was higher than the
median estimate for a 24,000 increase in a Bloomberg News survey
of 25 economists. The statistics bureau said the  unemployment
rate  declined to 4.9 percent from 5 percent.  New Zealand’s government will invest up to NZ$500 million
($389 million) in AMI Insurance if the package is called upon,
and will have the right to assume control of the company if it
needs to, Finance Minister Bill English said in an e-mailed
statement.  Christchurch was struck by a magnitude-6.3 earthquake on
Feb. 22 that killed more than 170 people and wrecked much of the
business district.  To contact the reporter on this story:
