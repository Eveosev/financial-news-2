Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
Britainâ€™s biggest state-run bank, issued $6.1 billion of top-
rated bonds backed by prime U.K. residential mortgages,
according to two people with knowledge of the transaction.  The bonds were issued through the Arran Mortgage Funding
Series 2011-1 Prime U.K. RMBS vehicle, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the transaction is private.
Three unrated or lower-graded tranches were not offered to
investors and retained.  The deal includes 893 million euros ($1.3 billion) and $660
million of notes with weighted-average lives of 0.99 years
priced at 120 basis points more than interbank lending rates,
said the people.  Three portions of 3.35-year bonds -- for 644.7 million
pounds ($1.05 billion), 538 million euros and $400 million --
have a 145 basis-point spread, the people said.  The final tranche is for 1.21 billion pounds, has a WAL of
5.14 years and is priced at 155 basis points over the London
interbank offered rate, or Libor, the people said.  RBS, which arranged the deal, also retained some of the
top-rated bonds, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
