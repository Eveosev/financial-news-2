DuPont Co. said it sued USA
Performance Technology Inc., Performance Group (USA) Inc. and
two individuals for allegedly misappropriating confidential
specifications for its titanium pigment manufacturing process.  The two defendant companies, both based in Oakland,
 California , and two of its employees have, or are in the process
of providing DuPont’s trade secrets to DuPont’s competitors in
 China , according to a complaint DuPont said was filed in federal
court in California.  The manufacturing process at the company’s titanium
pigment plant in Kuan Yin,  Taiwan , “has become the target of
misappropriation,” the complaint says. DuPont’s trade secret
information was found on the company computer of one of the
defendants, the lawsuit said. The filing of the complaint
couldn’t be confirmed through electronic court records.  USA Performance Technology and Performance Group, which
have the same phone number, didn’t return a message left on
voicemail today.  “DuPont is working closely with law enforcement
authorities with information regarding this matter,” said
Thomas Sager, DuPont’s general counsel, in a statement.  The suit seeks an injunction requiring return of its trade
secret information, prohibiting use of its proprietary
information and unspecified damages, DuPont said in the
statement.  DuPont is the world’s largest manufacturer of titanium
dioxide, a white pigment commonly used in coatings, plastics and
paper, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
