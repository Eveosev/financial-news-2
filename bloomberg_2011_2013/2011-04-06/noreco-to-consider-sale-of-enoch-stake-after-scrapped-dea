Norwegian Energy Co. ASA said its
stake in the Enoch field in  Norway ’s  North Sea  may be part of a
package of assets it will consider selling, acting Chief
Executive Officer Einar Gjelsvik said.  The oil and gas explorer, based in Stavanger, last month
canceled a $43 million sale of stakes in the Enoch and Oselvar
oil and gas fields to  Marubeni Corp (8002)  after the Tokyo-based
company failed to secure the required licenses from Norway.  The company will keep the Oselvar stake because it can
create more value developing the field after  oil prices  surged
and it completed “important pieces of work” to reduce risk,
Gjelsvik said in an interview yesterday in Oslo.  “We have already decided to stay in and fund Huntington
and Oselvar development, which will give us 89,000 new barrels
next year,” he said. “However, Enoch, which is a small
producing field, could very well be part of a sales package at
the right price.”  The company last week raised 600 million-krone ($109
million) in a bond sale to fund the costs of developing Oselvar.
Norwegian Energy on March 23 announced it had abandoned a five-
month effort to find a potential buyer and that its chief
executive had resigned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
