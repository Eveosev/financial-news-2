Kuwait National Petroleum Co. signed
a 153 million-dinar ($552 million) contract with Korea’s  GS
Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360)  to build 10 storage tanks for
butane and propane gases, an official said.  The tanks will have a capacity of 723,000 cubic metres and
will be built in the Mina Al-Ahmadi refinery, Mohammed al-Ajmi,
a spokesman for the state-run refinery operator, said today in a
phone interview in  Kuwait City . The contract will be for 36
months, he said.  Mina Al-Ahmadi, located south of Kuwait City, is the
country’s largest oil-processing plant with a capacity of about
460,000 barrels a day.  Kuwait, holder of the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves
and the fifth-biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, pumped 2.4 million barrels of crude a day
in March, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
