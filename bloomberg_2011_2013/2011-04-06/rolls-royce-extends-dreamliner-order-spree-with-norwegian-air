Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/) , the world’s
second-largest engine maker, said it won its first order for
aircraft power plants from Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, beating
rival  General Electric Co. (GE)   Norwegian also signed a $450 million maintenance package
for the engines, Rolls-Royce said in a statement today. The
London-based company has now been chosen for six out of the last
seven orders for Dreamliner engines, it said.  Boeing has blamed Rolls-Royce for contributing to the
production delays of the 787, originally scheduled to enter
service in 2008. A version of the engine blew out on a Rolls-
Royce test bed in the U.K. in August, and the facility had to
close for repairs.  “The Trent 1000 has demonstrated world-class fuel burn,
and its proven Trent family performance retention delivers this
benefit longer through life,” Tore Jenssen, fleet manager for
Norwegian, said in the statement.  The Norwegian Air contract means Rolls-Royce now has 21 787
customers for its Trent 1000 engines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
