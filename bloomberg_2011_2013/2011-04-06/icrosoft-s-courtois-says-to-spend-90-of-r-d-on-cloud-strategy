(Corrects second paragraph of story that ran yesterday to
show Courtois didn’t tell Bloomberg HT television that Microsoft
will easily meet 2011 targets.)  Microsoft International President
Jean-Philippe Courtois said the company will spend 90 percent of
its $9.6 billion research and development budget on cloud
strategy this year.  Microsoft’s global growth is “balanced and healthy” with
faster growth in emerging markets, Courtois said in an interview
with Bloomberg HT television in Istanbul today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
