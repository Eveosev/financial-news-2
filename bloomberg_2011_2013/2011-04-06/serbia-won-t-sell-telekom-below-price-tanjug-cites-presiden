Serbia won’t sell Telekom Srbija AD
for less than 1.4 billion euros ($2 billion), even though the
price may be difficult to achieve as the company is regional
rather than global, Tanjug reported, citing President  Boris Tadic .  “Decisions must be made on time and now is the time for
such a decision” as the present price of Telekom Srbija may be
lower in two years or three years, the Belgrade-based newswire
quoted Tadic as saying.  On March 29, Serbia gave  Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , the sole
bidder, 15 days to improve its offer, which fell below the 1.4
billion-euro all-cash demand. Telekom Austria offered to pay 950
million euros in cash and 450 million euros in investments over
three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
