Swiss inflation accelerated more
than economists forecast to the fastest pace in almost a year in
March, led by surging energy costs.  Consumer prices increased 1 percent from a year earlier
after advancing 0.5 percent in February, the  Federal Statistics
Office  in Neuchatel said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s
the biggest gain since May 2010. Economists forecast prices to
rise 0.5 percent from a year earlier, according to the median of
11 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Surging  oil prices  are fueling inflation, adding pressure
on companies to raise prices. While the  European Central Bank 
has signaled it’s ready to raise borrowing costs this month, the
Swiss central bank last month kept its benchmark interest rate
near zero to bolster an export-led recovery.  In the month, consumer prices advanced 0.6 percent. The
inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized method, rose 1
percent from a year earlier, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
