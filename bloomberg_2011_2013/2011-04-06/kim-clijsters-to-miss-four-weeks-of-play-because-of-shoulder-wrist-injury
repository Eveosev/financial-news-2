Kim Clijsters , ranked second in the
women’s tennis tour, will miss four weeks of the season because
of shoulder and wrist injuries.  The 27-year-old will miss the semifinals of the Fed Cup
next week and a tournament in Madrid, she said on her website.
Her medical staff suggested that she rest for between four and
six weeks. She should be ready for an event in Rome, starting
May 9, and the  French Open .  “I don’t want to force anything, because I want to prevent
it from becoming chronic,” she said. “I really want to be
there at this year’s Roland Garros.”  She’s not allowed to use a tennis racket during the period,
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
