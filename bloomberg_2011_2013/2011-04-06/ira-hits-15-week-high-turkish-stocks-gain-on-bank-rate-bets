The lira climbed to the highest
level in 15 weeks and Turkish stocks gained as investors bet
that the financial outlook for lenders is improving and concern
eased that the central bank will increase rates to control
inflation.  The lira rose 0.4 percent to 1.52398 per dollar at 11:55
a.m. in Istanbul, the strongest since Dec. 17. The ISE National
100 share index increased 1,079.17, or 1.6 percent, 68,768.63,
extending an 11-week high. Bonds gained, with yields falling 7
basis points to 8.70 percent, the lowest level in two weeks.  “Strong growth numbers, controlled inflation and increasing
credibility for the central bank” are helping Turkish assets,
Serhan Yenigun, a trader at Finansbank AS in Istanbul, said by
telephone. “The Moody’s report on banks added to bank
credibility and the hope is returning that a credit rating
increase may come sooner rather than later.”  The unexpected decline in the inflation rate to 4 percent,
announced by the statistics agency two days ago, eases pressure
on the central bank to increase rates from a record low of 6.25
percent. The central bank cut the benchmark rate by 75 basis
points in December and January and raised banks’  reserve
requirements  to control credit growth as the economy grew at an
annual 9.2 percent in the fourth quarter.  Moody’s  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  led the gains in banking shares,
rising 1.8 percent to 7.98 liras.  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS, the
country’s biggest bank by assets, climbed 2.3 percent to 5.30
liras.  Moody’s Investors Service said on April 4 that increases in
reserve requirements for banks by the central bank over the past
four months were “credit positive” for the industry. The
central bank has increased the cash the industry is required to
set aside to help crimp loan growth. Loans expanded 35 percent
annually in the week to March 25, the banking regulator in
Ankara said on April 4.  Park Elektrik Uretim Madencilik Sanayi & Ticaret AS, an
energy producer and miner, rose 2.9 percent to 4.28 liras. Park
Group, the company’s parent, and partner Cengiz Insaat applied
to the energy market regulator to build the plant on the Black
Sea coast, an official of the regulator said by telephone today
on the usual condition of anonymity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
