U.K.  house prices  may rise as much
as 5 percent this year because of a shortage of new properties,
according to Tony Pidgley, the  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) 
chairman who predicted the last residential slump.  No more than about 130,000 homes will be completed in 2011,
Pidgley said. That will fail to keep pace with demand,
particularly in  London  and the southeast of  England , he said. A
total of 100,400 homes were built last year and 178,700 were
constructed at the market’s last peak in 2007,  National House-
Building Council  data show.  “If you keep supply tight in a lot of areas, prices will
rise,” Pidgley, 63, said in an interview in London yesterday.
Berkeley is the U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by market
value after  Persimmon Plc. (PSN)   The U.K. faces a housing shortfall of about 1 million by
2015, with London worst affected, according to Savills Plc. Even
so, both the property broker and Halifax, the mortgage unit of
Lloyds Banking Group Plc, see prices falling this year because
of restrictions on lending.  Halifax today reported a 3.2 percent price drop in March
from a year earlier.  Martin Ellis , an economist at the company,
forecast a 2 percent decline for this year.  Most homebuilders are more optimistic. A survey by
Zoopla.co.uk published yesterday showed that on average, they
expect prices to climb 2.9 percent in the next six months as
Britons become more confident about the outlook for the  property
market .  London Focus  Berkeley, based in the English town of Cobham, sold off
land in 1988, a year before the residential property market
slumped. Pidgley abandoned high-volume homebuilding in 2004 and
his company has benefited more than its competitors from an
increase in demand for homes in London and the southeast of
England, which started in April 2009, because of its focus on
the area.  During the first half of Berkeley’s fiscal year, which
ended on Oct. 31, the average selling price of the company’s
homes was 262,000 pounds ($427,000), down from 299,000 pounds a
year earlier. The average price for the whole of fiscal 2010 was
263,000 pounds.  “He has been very good at calling the direction of
demand,” said Robin Hardy, an analyst at Peel Hunt with a
“buy” rating on Berkeley. Even so, “everything is against a
rise of any kind of strength in house prices,” he said.  Hometrack Ltd. said last week that an increase in the
supply of homes for sale outpaced demand, causing house prices
to fall for a ninth month in March. The same day,  Nationwide
Building Society  said values unexpectedly rose for a second
month because some prospective sellers were reluctant to put
their homes on the market.  A  Bank of England  report last week showed mortgage
approvals rose to 46,967 in February, the highest level since
November. Even so, it was only about half the average level
recorded over the last decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
