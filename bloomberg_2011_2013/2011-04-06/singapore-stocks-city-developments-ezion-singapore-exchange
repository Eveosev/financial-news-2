developer, gained 1.2 percent to S$11.74. The company said it
and partners paid the government S$413.3 million ($328 million)
for a property in Bartley Road in northeastern Singapore. A
residential condominium will be built on the site, it said.  Ezion Holdings Ltd. (EZI)  , a provider of marine
logistics and support services, rose 2.2 percent to 70.5
Singapore cents. The company said its newly-formed joint venture
with Australia’s Buccaneer Energy Ltd. won a $109.5 million
contract to provide a jack-up rig in  Alaska .  Gallant Venture Ltd. (GALV)  , the owner of industrial
parks and resorts in Bintan, Indonesia, surged 18 percent to 50
Singapore cents, prompting the  Singapore Exchange  to ask the
company to explain the reason for the jump in its share price.
The company said it was not aware of any specific reason, except
that DBS Group Holdings Ltd. recommended its stock as a “buy.”  “We believe the development of Lagoi Bay as an integrated
resort will spur much investor interest and land sales in the
future,” Derek Tan, an analyst at DBS, wrote in a note to
clients today. The brokerage had a share-price forecast of 88
Singapore cents for Gallant.  Hiap Seng Engineering Ltd. (HSE)  , the provider of
engineering services in the oil and gas industry, jumped 6.9
percent to 54.5 Singapore cents. The company said it received an
$8.4 million refinery maintenance contract in  Vietnam .  OKP Holdings Ltd. (OKP)  , the road builder, climbed 4.8
percent to 65 Singapore cents after the company said it won a
S$61.7 million from the Singapore government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
