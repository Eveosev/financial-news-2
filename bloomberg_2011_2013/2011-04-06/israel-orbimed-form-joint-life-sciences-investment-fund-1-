The Israeli government and OrbiMed
Healthcare Fund Management signed an agreement today to form a
$200 million joint life sciences investment fund.  The OrbiMed  Israel  Partners fund will invest in Israeli
life science companies, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz and
OrbiMed General Partner Jonathan Silverstein said at a press
conference in Jerusalem today. OrbiMed has raised $160 million
and the government will invest the remainder.  “The decision to operate in Israel is due to our
recognition of the great potential in Israel in the area of life
sciences in the next few years,” Silverstein said.  Israel is trying to capitalize on its life sciences
industry, which includes 700 companies, to help boost growth
following the global crisis. The government is aiming to partner
with the private sector to help translate research and
development achievements into commercial successes.  OrbiMed, a U.S. based-investment firm with more than $5
billion in assets under management, invests in pharmaceutical,
biotechnology and medical device companies. The company has
invested in Israeli companies for the past decade, including
Given Imaging Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
