U.S. Defense Secretary  Robert Gates 
arrived in the Saudi capital of Riyadh today to meet with King Abdullah on the upheaval in the region, the threat from Iran and
a $60 billion U.S. arms package for  Saudi Arabia , the Associated
Press reported.  It is Gates’s third trip to the region in the past month.
The regional turmoil has included troops from Saudi Arabia and
other Arab states entering Bahrain to help quell protests in
that Persian Gulf nation. The incursion occurred within days of
a March visit by Gates to Bahrain’s capital, Manama.  Bahrain’s crackdown and the Saudi military intervention
“could turn a mass movement for democratic reform into an armed
conflict while regionalizing a genuinely internal political
struggle,” according to an analysis published today by the
 International Crisis Group . The Brussels-based organization
advocates for policies to prevent conflicts.  The U.S. defense chief, like other Obama administration
officials, has urged Arab governments to respond quickly to
peaceful protesters’ demands for reform.  Gates probably won’t raise Saudi Arabia’s own internal
political tensions during the visit, the AP reported, citing a
U.S. defense official traveling with the secretary. Relations
with Saudi Arabia have been strained because the kingdom’s
rulers saw the U.S. as abandoning a long-time ally, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, when demonstrators there successfully
called for his ouster, the AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
