Duke University guard Kyrie Irving,
who missed most of his freshman season with a foot injury, will
skip the final three years of his college eligibility to enter
the 2011 National Basketball Association draft.  Irving, 19, plans to hire an agent, Duke said yesterday on
its website, citing coach  Mike Krzyzewski . The decision comes as
the NBA prepares for a potential work stoppage at the end of its
collective bargaining agreement, which expires June 30.  In 11 games for the Blue Devils, Irving averaged 17.5
points and 4.3 assists per game, while shooting 53 percent from
the field. He missed 26 games in the middle of the season with a
right toe injury and returned to play in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament, where Duke lost in the regional
semifinals.  University of North Carolina  sophomore guard John Henson
and junior forward Tyler Zeller will return to school next year,
the Tar Heels said on their website. UNC freshman forward
Harrison Barnes is still exploring the option of entering the
draft, which will be held June 23 in  Newark ,  New Jersey .  -- Editors: Rob Gloster, Dex McLuskey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
