Comerica Inc. (CMA) ’s bullish options
volume jumped to the highest level since July 2009 as investors
bet that the bank that posted annual profits throughout the
financial crisis will pare this year’s 12 percent decline.  More than 14,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands as of
3:28 p.m. in New York, eight times the four-week average and
eight times the number of puts to sell. Almost all of today’s
call volume was concentrated in April $38 calls, which doubled
to 28 cents and had an open interest of 2,922 contracts before
today. Shares of the Dallas-based bank, which haven’t closed
above $38 since March 14, gained 1 percent to $37.36.  This month’s options expire April 15. The lender reports
quarterly results April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
