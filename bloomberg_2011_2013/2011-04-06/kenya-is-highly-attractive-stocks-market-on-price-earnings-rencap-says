Kenya, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s worst-
performing stock market in the first quarter, is a “highly
attractive” frontier market as it’s among the cheapest on
current price-earnings levels, Renaissance Capital said.  “While we remain cautious about a Kenyan macro recovery,
the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  is still on our radar,” analysts
incuding Mbithe Muema and Lagos-based Olaleye Adekeye wrote in
an e-mailed note to clients today. “The market trades 23
percent below its four-year average price-earnings multiple and
at discounts of 26 percent and 29 percent to its frontier-market
peers on a 2011 and 2012 earnings basis.”  The East African nation’s bond yields are likely to rise
further with “inflaton on the back of high  oil prices  to
continue to drive up Kenya’s borrowing costs,” they said.
Yields will need to be “commensurately high to attract
investors to longer-dated paper, with shorter-dated paper
appearing less risky and more appealing.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
