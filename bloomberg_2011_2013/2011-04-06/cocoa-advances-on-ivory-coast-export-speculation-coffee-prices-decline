Cocoa rose for the third time in
four days on speculation that  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest
producer, will be slow to resume exports disrupted by a deadly
political conflict. Sugar, coffee and orange juice fell.  Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized winner of
a disputed Nov. 28 presidential election, was on the verge of
winning the battle to control Ivory Coast. Once the conflict
ends, exporters may need a “few days or weeks” to resume
shipments, the International Cocoa Organization said.  “The challenge now is to stabilize exports from the
country,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures
in Tampa.  Cocoa for July delivery rose $21, or 0.7 percent, to settle
at $3,014 a metric ton at 12:07 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Prices touched a 32-year high of $3,775 on March 4 as the
prolonged conflict disrupted supply.  In London, cocoa futures for July delivery gained 10
pounds, or 0.5 percent, to 1,921 pounds ($3,138) a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery fell 0.65 cent, or 2.5
percent, to 24.97 cents a pound on ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery dropped 3.1 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $2.6515 a pound in New York.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery retreated 1.95 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $1.6405 a pound on ICE, declining for the
first time in five sessions.  In London, refined sugar and robusta coffee fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
