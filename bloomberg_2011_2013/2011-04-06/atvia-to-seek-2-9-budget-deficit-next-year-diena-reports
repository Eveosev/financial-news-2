Latvia will seek agreement with its
international lenders for a budget deficit of 2.9 percent of
gross domestic product next year,  Diena  reported, citing the
 Finance Ministry â€™s parliamentary secretary, Ilze Vinkele.  The deficit would require additional budget measures of
between 130 million lati ($261 million) and 150 million lati,
the newspaper reported.  The government will meet a mission from the International
Monetary Fund and the European Commission today in an effort to
unlock more of its 7.5 billion-euro loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
