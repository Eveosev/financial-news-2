DP World Ltd. (DPW)  rose to a two-month
high after the ports operator said it will seek investors’
approval to combine 20 shares into one before a dual listing in
 London .  The shares gained 2.2 percent to $0.64, the highest
intraday level since Feb. 2, at 11:12 a.m. in Dubai.  The consolidation "will better position DP World’s share
price alongside global companies," DP World said. Shareholders
will receive $2 share for every 20 existing shares of 10 cents
each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
