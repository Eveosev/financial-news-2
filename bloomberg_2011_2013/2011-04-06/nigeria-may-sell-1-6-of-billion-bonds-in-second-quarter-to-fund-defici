Nigeria  may sell as much as 245
billion naira ($1.6 billion) of bonds during the second quarter
of this year, the country’s  Debt Management Office  said.  Bond sales for the quarter will open on April 20 with
between 30 billion to 40 billion naira each of seven-year and
five-year debt on offer, according to the provisional calendar
published today on the website of the Abuja-based agency.  On May 18, 35 billion to 45 billion naira of seven-year
bonds will be on offer, along with 30 billion to 40 billion
naira of five-year notes. Sales for the quarter will conclude on
June 15 with 30 billion to 40 billion naira each of three- and
five-year debt on offer.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s biggest oil producer, plans to borrow 865
billion naira to fund its  budget deficit  this fiscal year, 38
percent less than in 2010, Finance Minister Olusegun Aganga said
on Jan. 5.  The country’s Senate increased the deficit to 1.3 trillion
naira from an initial estimate of 857 billion naira when it
passed a 4.97 trillion naira budget on March 16. That’s 17
percent more than President Goodluck Jonathan had proposed for
spending in December.  Nigeria’s budget includes 2.47 trillion naira for recurrent
spending and 1.56 trillion naira for capital projects, based on
oil output of 2.3 million barrels a day and an oil price of $75
a barrel, $10 more than originally proposed by the president,
and an exchange rate of 150 naira per dollar. Jonathan must sign
the plan before it becomes law.  The country sold 186.5 billion naira of three- and five-
year bonds in the first three months of this year, the smallest
quarterly offering the last quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
