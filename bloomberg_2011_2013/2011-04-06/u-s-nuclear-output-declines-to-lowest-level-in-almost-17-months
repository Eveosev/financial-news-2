U.S. nuclear-power output fell to
the lowest level in almost 17 months as  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  shut the
Waterford 3 reactor in Louisiana, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said.  Power generation nationwide decreased by 411 megawatts, or
0.5 percent, from yesterday to 75,774 megawatts, or 75 percent
of capacity, the smallest amount since Nov. 9, 2009, according
to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-four of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Entergy Corp. idled the 1,157-megawatt Waterford 3 reactor
about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of New Orleans. The unit was
operating at about 85 percent of capacity since Feb. 21 because
of high vibration on a feedwater pump, the NRC said.  The Tennessee Valley Authority started the 1,104-megawatt
Browns Ferry 2 reactor in Alabama. It was operating at 1 percent
of capacity.  Two other reactors at the site, the 1,065-megawatt Unit 1
and the 1,115-megawatt Unit 3, are operating at full power. The
plant is 84 miles north of Birmingham.  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  boosted the 1,100-megawatt McGuire 2 in
 North Carolina  to 55 percent of capacity from 10 percent
yesterday. The 1,100-megawatt McGuire 1, is operating at full
power at the site 15 miles north of  Charlotte .  Southern Co. (SO)  increased output from the 1,109-megawatt
Vogtle 1 reactor in Georgia to 94 percent of capacity from 87
percent yesterday. The unit is returning from an outage that
began March 7.  The plant is 26 miles southeast of Augusta. Another reactor
at the site, the 1,127-megawatt Vogtle 2, is at full capacity.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
