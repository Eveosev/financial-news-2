EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) ,
a German utility, bought a 12-megawatt wind farm in western
 Germany  and is testing the nation’s first offshore wind project
in the  Baltic Sea .  EnBW purchased the six-turbine project near the city of
Trier from Danish developer Eurowind Energy A/S, it said
yesterday in a  statement . The Karlsruhe, Germany-based company
did not give a price.  The utility is testing its 50-megawatt Baltic 1 wind farm
and expects the offshore project to go into operation on May 2,
it  said  April 4.  EnBW expects to have 10 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity
by 2020, after installing 108 megawatts last year, according to
the  German WindEnergy Association .  Germany’s first offshore wind farm, Alpha Ventus, was
developed by  E.ON AG (EOAN) , Vattenfall Europe AG and EWE AG, and went
into operation in the North Sea last year.  EnBW operates about 160 megawatts of wind capacity and
expects to invest 3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) to meet its
2020 target of generating 20 percent of its energy from
renewable sources.  EnBW is developing four other offshore wind farms with
capacity of about 1,200 megawatts. It expects to begin
construction on Baltic 2, its second offshore project, next
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
