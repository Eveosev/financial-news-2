First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) , a
Nigerian lender, increased its loans 38 percent in 2010 while
the ratio of non-performing loans fell to 5.5 percent, said Ladi
Balogun, its chief executive officer.  FCMB exceeded its loan growth target of 30 percent by
focusing on top-tier clients to “grow our share of corporate
customers,” Balogun said on a conference call today. The bank
will target 30 percent growth in loans in 2011, he said. The
non-performing loans ratio was 8.7 percent in 2009, the Lagos-
based lender said in an e-mailed presentation document.  A debt crisis almost crippled  Nigeria ’s banks in 2009
before the  Central Bank of Nigeria  recapitalized the industry
with an injection of 620 billion naira ($4 billion). The central
bank fired the chief executive officers of eight of the
country’s 24 lenders. FCMB, which wasn’t among the banks that
were bailed out, on March 30 reported full-year 2010 net income
of 7.93 billion naira, from 564 million naira in the eight
months through December 2009.  The stock fell 5 kobo, or 0.7 percent, to 7.10 naira, by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. FCMB has declined 5 percent this
year, compared with a 0.3 percent drop in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
