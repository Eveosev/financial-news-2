German government bonds fell,
narrowing the difference in yield, or spread, with Spanish
government bonds to the least since Nov. 3.  The German bond yield rose three basis points to 3.42
percent as of 1:29 p.m. in  London , while the yield on similar-
maturity Spanish securities dropped eight basis points to 5.22
percent. That narrowed the yield spread to 180 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
