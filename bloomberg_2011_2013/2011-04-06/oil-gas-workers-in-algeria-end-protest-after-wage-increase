Thousands of workers threatening to
halt production at  Algeria ’s largest oil and natural-gas
facilities ended a protest after state-run Sonatrach agreed to
boost their wages, said an official at the oil workers’ union.  The Algiers-based company will increase the salaries of
workers in places including Hassi R’Mel and Gassi Touil by 80
percent retroactively from July 1, 2008, Beldjerdi Sid Ali,
secretary-general of the union, said today by telephone.  Algeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, pumped 1.26 million barrels of crude per
day in March, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
