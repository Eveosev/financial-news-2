Rio Tinto  Group expects copper
demand in China and emerging countries to grow faster than mine
output, as more people in developing nations buy cars and homes.  A global shortage of the metal used in pipes and wires may
widen this year to between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons,
 Andrew Harding , head of Rio Tinto’s copper business, said today
in an interview in Santiago.  "You’ve got this very strong demand in the long term being
driven by China," Harding said. "And the supply side is not
going to respond with the speed to match that."  Copper rose the most in two weeks today as Freeport McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc., the world’s largest publicly traded
producer, said that demand in  China , the world’s biggest user of
industrial metals, will continue to increase.  Copper futures for May delivery gained 10.75 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $4.3720 a pound at 12:57 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, heading for the biggest gain for a most-active contract
since March 23.  “In the long run, we are very confident about the outlook
for copper demand in China,” Richard Adkerson, the chief
executive officer of Phoenix-based Freeport, said yesterday in
an interview in Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
