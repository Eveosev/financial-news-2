Ghana  National Petroleum Corp. will
spend $40 million to begin onshore oil exploration in the Volta
River basin this year, the  Daily Graphic  said.  The state-owned  oil company  hopes to gather seismic data
that will attract private exploration investment in the region,
which covers about 40 percent of the West African nation’s land
area, the newspaper said, citing Thomas Manu, the company’s
director of exploration and production.  Ghana’s offshore Jubilee field began production in 2010 and
is scheduled to reach 120,000 barrels of oil a day this year. It
holds an estimated 800 million barrels of reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
