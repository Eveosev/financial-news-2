Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  and  Talisman Energy
Inc. (TLM) ’s Colombian venture plans to begin exploratory drilling
next year for natural gas at offshore blocks in the Caribbean.  The venture, Equion Energia Ltd., may begin production in
the region in 2016, company President Maria Victoria Riano said
today in an interview in Cartagena.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  also
is a partner in the blocks off the nation’s northern coast.  Colombia has awarded drilling rights at offshore oil blocks
and in remote jungle areas as it seeks to double oil production
to 1.7 million barrels per day in 2020. Equion may consider
taking part in new auctions to boost reserves, while also
increasing oil recovery at aging fields, Riano said.  The government plans three new auctions from 2012 through
2014, the nation’s oil regulator said yesterday. State-
controlled Ecopetrol,  Colombia ’s largest oil producer, and
Talisman bought assets from BP Plc last year as the company
sought to pay for the cost of its Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  Colombian oil production hit a monthly record in March of
884,000 barrels a day, most of which is produced by Ecopetrol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
