The euro strengthened to a 14-month
high versus the dollar before a likely increase in  interest
rates  by the  European Central Bank  tomorrow while the yen sank
on speculation borrowing costs will remain near zero. Gold
climbed to a record, and European stocks fell.  The euro appreciated 0.6 percent against the dollar at
10:48 a.m. in  London . The yen weakened against its major peers.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.2 percent, and Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index futures rose 0.3 percent. A gauge of bank
creditworthiness improved to its strongest level since Oct. 28.
Portuguese two-year yields slipped four basis points after the
sale of 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of bills. Gold futures
climbed to $1,460.20 an ounce.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said last month policy
makers may raise the main refinancing rate, prompting the  Swiss
National Bank  to say today an increase would give it more leeway
on the path of borrowing costs. Federal Reserve officials
differed on whether to begin removing stimulus amid evidence the
 U.S. economy  is recovering, according to minutes of their March
meeting.  Japan ’s central bank may keep its target rate at zero
to 0.1 percent, economists said before tomorrow’s meeting.  “The rise we’re seeing in the euro is very much interest-
rate driven,” said Sarah Hewin, a senior economist at Standard
Chartered Plc in London. “Markets are increasingly shifting
from the view of a one-and-done rate hike at the next meeting,
to one that sees more rate hikes further out.”  The euro jumped 0.7 percent to 121.48 yen, the strongest
level in almost 11 months. The Japanese currency slid as much as
0.8 percent against the U.S. currency, trading at less than 85
per dollar for the first time since September. The franc rose
0.4 percent against the euro and 0.9 percent versus the dollar.  Aussie, Kiwi  The Australian dollar strengthened to a 30-month high
against the yen, advancing as much as 1.2 percent.  New Zealand ’s
dollar climbed 0.9 percent against Japan’s currency, rising for
a 10th day in the longest run of gains since 2005.  Three stocks fell for every two that gained in the Stoxx
Europe 600.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest lender,
advanced 2.8 percent and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  climbed 0.9 percent
after detailing their plans to raise capital. Other banks fell,
with  France ’s Societe Generale SA declining 2.4 percent and
Deutsche Bank AG sliding 2.2 percent.  The cost of insuring bank debt dropped to a five-month low,
with the Markit iTraxx Financial index of credit-default swaps
falling 5.5 basis points to 124 basis points. Contracts on
Commerzbank’s senior debt fell 10 basis points to 123, the
lowest since December, according to CMA.  The increase in S&P 500 futures indicated the benchmark
gauge for U.S. equities will rise for the third time in four
days. Stocks were little changed yesterday, erasing earlier
gains, on speculation the Fed will curb stimulus measures.  Inflation Outlook  The difference in yield between five-year U.S. Treasury
notes and inflation-linked debt, a gauge of investor inflation
expectations, widened to the most since July 2008, while the
German and French 10-year breakeven rates advanced to records
this week.  Gold for June delivery gained 0.3 percent to $1,456.70 an
ounce on the Comex in  New York  after rising to an all-time high
of $1,460.20. Immediate-delivery bullion increased as much as
0.2 percent to a record $1,459.07. Silver for immediate delivery
was little changed at $39.3075 an ounce after reaching $39.5013,
the highest price since Feb. 11, 1980.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced 0.6 percent,
gaining for a seventh day, its longest winning streak since Nov.
5. The Shanghai Composite Index added 1.1 percent, a day after
the People’s Bank of  China  boosted its benchmark one-year
lending rate. The central bank’s tightening cycle is nearing its
end and it may boost borrowing costs one more time this year,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report. Taiwan’s Taiex Index
rose 1.7 percent and  Turkey ’s  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  jumped 1.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
