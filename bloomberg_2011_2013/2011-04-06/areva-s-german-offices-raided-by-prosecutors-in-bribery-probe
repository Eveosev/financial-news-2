German offices of  Areva SA (CEI) , the
world’s largest supplier of nuclear equipment and services, were
raided by prosecutors in a probe over possible bribery payments.  Eight suspects, including five current and former Areva
employees are being investigated over bribery and breach of
trust allegations, prosecutors in Nuremberg,  Germany , said in an
e-mailed statement today. The suspects may have transferred
company money to slush funds abroad to “get competitive
advantages,” prosecutors said.  Prosecutors searched offices of the Areva NP unit in
Erlangen, Germany, and an archive in the town of Offenbach
yesterday, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Areva is
cooperating and the probe isn’t directed at the company, it
said. The alleged actions may have been harmful to the company,
Areva said.  Areva rivals including  Siemens AG (SIE)  and Alstom SA, have both
been caught up in European bribery probes. Siemens agreed to pay
$1.6 billion to settle bribery allegations in the U.S. and
Germany in 2008 and three U.K. Alstom executives were arrested
last year in a separate probe there.  Investigators yesterday raided 31 homes and offices in
Germany and the  Czech Republic , prosecutors said. Three suspects
are consultants who may have helped the Areva employees in the
alleged actions, prosecutors said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
