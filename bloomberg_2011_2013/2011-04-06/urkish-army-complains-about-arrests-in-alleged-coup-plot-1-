Turkey ’s military said it had
“difficulty understanding” the continued detention of 163
serving and retired officers for their involvement in an alleged
coup plot.  The army referred to a decision by a court yesterday
retaining the officers in custody for their suspected
involvement in “sledgehammer,” an alleged attempt to overthrow
Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government, according to
an e-mailed statement on its Web site today.  The army has explained the nature and content of a seminar
held by military officers where prosecutors said the plot was
hatched, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
