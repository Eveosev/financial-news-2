Japan  should form a public-private
fund of at least 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion) to help finance
clear-up work following the nation’s strongest recorded
earthquake, according to a trade group.  Finance companies, builders and equipment-makers would
likely invest or work on projects, Kazuo Ueda, president of the
Japan PFI PPP Association, told reporters today in  Tokyo . The
group represents companies involved in public-private projects.  A bidding process for the initiative may start in August,
according to the group, which plans to discuss the idea with
local governments. A magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on March
11 obliterated towns in Japan’s Tohoku region, leaving about
27,500 people dead or missing, and destroying, damaging, or
sweeping away more than 200,000 buildings, according to the
 National Police Agency .  To contact the reporters on this story:
