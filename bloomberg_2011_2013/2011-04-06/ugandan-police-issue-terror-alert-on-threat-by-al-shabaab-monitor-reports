Uganda  issued a terror alert, the
third this year, after receiving a threat from suspected al-
Shabaab militants, the Daily Monitor reported, citing Police
Chief Kale Kayihura.  All police units in the East African country have been
placed on high alert and are increasing patrols, the Kampala-
based newspaper said.  Al-Shabaab, the Somali militia accused by the U.S. of
having links to al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility for twin bomb
blasts in Kampala in July 2010 in which 76 people died. Uganda
