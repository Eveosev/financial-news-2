Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH’s family
owners want the drugmaker to remain independent and won’t sell
the company,  Die Zeit  reported, citing Christian Boehringer,
chairman of the shareholder committee.  Would-be acquirers have been and will continue to be
rejected, the newspaper quoted Boehringer as saying in a preview
of an interview to be published tomorrow. The family is planning
for the long term and wants the company to be healthy for the
next 10 years, Boehringer was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
