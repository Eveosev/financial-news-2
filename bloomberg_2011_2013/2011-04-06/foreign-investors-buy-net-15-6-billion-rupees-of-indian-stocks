Overseas investors bought a net 15.6
billion rupees ($351.6 million) of Indian stocks on April 4 and
April 5, raising total investments in equity this year to 31.5
billion rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 49.2 billion rupees of shares and sold
33.6 billion rupees on those two days, the  Securities and
Exchange Board of India  said  today . They bought a net 3 billion
rupees of bonds over the same period, taking their purchases in
debt this year to 115.3 billion rupees.  Overseas funds returned in March, after withdrawing 94
billion rupees in January and February on concern accelerating
inflation will prompt further interest rate gains. They bought a
record 1.33 trillion rupees of shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17
percent rally in the Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index,
the best performer among the world’s 10 biggest equity markets
last year. The Sensex has fallen 4.4 percent this year.  Foreign funds have placed 4.5 trillion rupees in equities
and 902 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into the
country in 1993. The previous record was in 2009 when flows
reached 834.2 billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18
years. Funds withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in
2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
