Brazil ’s real declined the most
among emerging-market currencies after the government said it
will announce additional currency measures today.  The real erased earlier gains, falling 0.3 percent to
1.6144 per dollar at 5:17 p.m. in New York, from 1.6096
yesterday. The currency earlier rose to 1.6012, the strongest
intraday level since August 2008.  The currency reversed course after the government said that
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  will announce currency measures
today at 6:30 p.m. local time (5:30 p.m. New York time) in
Brasilia. Mantega told reporters April 4 that Brazil will
continue to adopt measures seeking to reduce “excessive”
dollar inflows.  Investors’ reaction to the announcement “shows how
overbought the market is,” said Marjorie Hernandez, a currency
strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  New York . “It becomes more
sensitive to profit taking on the back of either external shocks
or in this case domestic events like these headlines.”  In October, Mantega tripled a tax on fixed-income
investments by foreigners to 6 percent to curb the real’s
appreciation. The currency has gained 44 percent since the end
of 2008, the most among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg over the period.  Yields on interest-rate futures contracts due in January
2012, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
