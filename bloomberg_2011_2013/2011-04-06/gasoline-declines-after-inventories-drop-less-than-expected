Gasoline futures declined after the
U.S. Energy Department reported inventories dropped less than
expected.  Stockpiles declined 357,000 barrels to 216.7 million, the
report showed. The median forecast of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a decline of 1.9 million barrels.  Gasoline demand was little changed at 8.85 million barrels
a day. The four-week average dropped 0.9 percent to 8.91
million.  Gasoline for May delivery fell 0.96 cent, or 0.3 percent,
to $3.1917 a gallon at 10:34 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price, which settled yesterday at $3.2013, was
$3.1957 before the report was released at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
