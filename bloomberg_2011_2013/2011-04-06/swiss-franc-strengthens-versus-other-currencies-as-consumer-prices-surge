The Swiss franc strengthened against
14 of its 16 most-actively traded counterparts as data showed
inflation accelerated more than economists forecast in March.  The currency gained most against  Japan ’s yen as Swiss
statistics showed consumer prices increased 1 percent in March
from a year earlier, above the 0.5 percent median gain of 12
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Swiss National Bank board
member Jean-Pierre Danthine told Boersen-Zeitung that an
interest-rate increase by the  European Central Bank  would give
Switzerland leeway in deciding its own policy.  The franc appreciated 0.9 percent to 91.70 centimes per
dollar as of 4:34 p.m. in  London  and strengthened 0.1 percent to
1.3149 per euro after reaching 1.3068. The Swiss currency
appreciated as much as 1.7 percent against the yen to 93.285,
the most since October 2008.  “The CPI data were a bit of a surprise, much higher than
expectations,” said  Chris Walker , a foreign-exchange strategist
at UBS AG in London. “The market wasn’t positioned for such a
strong print. That’s why we’ve seen quite a big move.”  The ECB will increase the key interest rate by 25 basis
points to 1.25 percent tomorrow, according to all 57 economists
in a separate Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
