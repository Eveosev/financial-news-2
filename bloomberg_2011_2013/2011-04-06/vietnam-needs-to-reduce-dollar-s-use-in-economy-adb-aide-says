Vietnam needs to reduce U.S. dollar
transactions in its economy and restore confidence in the dong
as faster inflation deters use of the local currency, said  Ayumi Konishi , the  Asian Development Bank ’s Vietnam director.  Dollars make up about 20 percent of money used in Vietnam,
Konishi told reporters at a conference in Hanoi today. With
inflation a concern, “people really didn’t feel comfortable to
hold onto their assets in dong, they rushed to the gold market
or the money changers, got dollars and put them under the
pillow,” he said.  The depletion of Vietnam’s foreign-exchange reserves is
also prompting locals to push down the dong, Konishi said.  Foreign reserves of Vietnam were estimated at $12.4 billion
at the end of 2010, covering about 1.9 months of imports, the
ADB said in a report released today. The  World Bank  in March 21
gave the same figures and said that fell from $14.2 billion at
the end of 2009 and $23 billion at the end of 2008.  The Southeast Asian nation has been struggling to combat
inflation at a 25-month high. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung in
February approved a resolution asking ministries to narrow a
 budget deficit  to less than 5 percent of gross domestic product
and cut credit growth to less than 20 percent from 23 percent.
He also lowered the money-supply growth target to about 15
percent to 16 percent from as much as 24 percent.  Inflation ‘High’  “Even with a successful implementation of the resolution,
it will take time for the inflation numbers to come down,”
Konishi said. “Inflation is anticipated to remain high through
2011 averaging 13.3 percent before moderating to an average 6.8
percent in 2012.”  Consumer prices increased 13.89 percent in March from a
year earlier, the fastest pace since February 2009, the
statistics office said March 24. Prices were fanned by more
expensive energy and higher import costs caused by devaluations
of the dong. The government targeted curbing inflation at no
more than 7 percent this year.  “I do think that as a medium-term goal for  Vietnam , to
really eliminate, reduce the dollarization in its economy is
certainly a necessary step,” Konishi said.  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
