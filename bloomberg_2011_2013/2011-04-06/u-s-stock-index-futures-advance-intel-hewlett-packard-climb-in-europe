U.S. stocks rose, sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  to the highest level since 2008, as
 Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  spurred a technology rally and European
lenders’ plans to raise capital lifted financial shares.  Cisco Systems  rallied 4.9 percent on speculation the maker
of networking equipment will sell or spin off its consumer
business. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. added
at least 1.8 percent.  Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)  added 3.9 percent as
Oppenheimer & Co. raised its rating for the maker of chips for
television set-top boxes.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,335.54 at 4 p.m. The benchmark gauge rose as high as 1,339.38,
near 1,343.01, its closing high for the rally since March 2009.
The Dow average advanced 32.85 points, or 0.3 percent, to
12,426.75, the highest level on a closing basis since June 2008.  “We’re beginning a period of a self-sustaining recovery,”
said  Michael Strauss , who helps oversee $27 billion as chief
investment strategist at Commonfund in Wilton,  Connecticut .
“There’s strength in economic data and corporate earnings.
Technology, in particular, is an area where the generation of
 cash flow  presents an interesting valuation play. There are a
number of companies looking to tweak their business models to
help to get that more into focus,” he said. “If we break into
new highs, we’ll certainly see new buyers into the market.”  Record Stimulus Measures  The S&P 500 yesterday snapped a two-day gain as minutes
from the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting spurred speculation
central bankers may begin removing record stimulus measures
enacted to ensure the economy recovered from recession. The
index had surged 27 percent through yesterday since Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke ’s suggested on Aug. 27 a second round of asset
purchases to stimulate the economy, a tactic known as
quantitative easing.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration is preparing for
the potential of a partial government shutdown that may come as
soon as this weekend unless the White House and congressional
Republicans can come to terms on a budget. Obama has called for
daily negotiations to settle differences. Current spending
authority for government operations is set to expire on April 8
and lawmakers remain at odds on approving a budget for the rest
of the fiscal year.  Momentum vs. Uncertainty  “It’s economic momentum versus policy uncertainty,” said
 Alan Gayle , senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Capital
Management in Richmond,  Virginia , which oversees $45 billion.
“Investors are concerned about potential headwinds related to
budget concerns, inflation fears and the impact of Fed policy
going forward. That’s weighing on the market as we approach the
highs for the  bull-market  rally.”  The  S&P 500  is trading near its bull market closing high of
1,343.01 on Feb. 18. Should the index close above that level, it
could climb to 1,381, the next stop on its recovery from a
plunge from its 1,576.09 intraday record in October 2007 to a
low of 666.79 in March 2009, according to Schaeffer’s Investment
Research’s  Ryan Detrick .  “The fundamental drivers will probably continue to pull
this market higher,” Detrick said in an interview from
Cincinnati. “After that, the next logical area would be 1,440
on the S&P 500, which is the May 2008 peak.”  Cisco had the biggest gain in the Dow average, rising 4.9
percent to $18.07. Morgan Stanley said it expects structural
changes after Chief Executive Officer John Chambers yesterday
announced plans to make a “number” of targeted moves.  Splitting Up  “We believe Cisco may be better off splitting itself into
two or more businesses with different targets for growth and
margin,” Morgan Stanley analyst  Ehud Gelblum  wrote in a note
dated yesterday, reiterating his views from a Feb. 10 report. [bn:WBTKR=BRCM:US]   Broadcom [] climbed 3.9 percent to $39.95. The biggest maker
of chips for television set-top boxes was raised to
“outperform” from “market perform” by Oppenheimer.  Monsanto declined 5.7 percent to $69.16. The company
said its fourth-quarter loss will widen because of a decline in
agricultural-chemical earnings. Profit excluding some items will
rise to $2.72 to $2.82 per share in the 2011 fiscal year, from
$2.41 a year earlier, Monsanto said, reiterating a forecast
first made in October. The average estimate of 21 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was $2.85.  The S&P 500 may climb to a record 1,600 next year as U.S.
corporate profits benefit from global economic growth, said
Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at U.S. Trust.  Profit by companies in the benchmark measure for U.S.
equities will increase about 7 percent to 8 percent next year as
the S&P 500’s valuation climbs to 16 times earnings, he said.
The index is trading at 13.7 times estimated 2011 earnings,
Bloomberg data show.  “Global growth is going to be rising 4.5 percent-plus
through this,” Hyzy, who oversees $367.7 billion in client
assets at the  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  unit, said in an interview
today on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness” with Margaret Brennan. As the global expansion has a larger impact than in the
past on the balance sheets of U.S. companies, Hyzy said, it may
also extend the bull market. “We call it a global bull
marathon, not a race,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
