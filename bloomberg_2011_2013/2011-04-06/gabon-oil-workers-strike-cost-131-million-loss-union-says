A four-day strike by oil workers in
 Gabon  cost the government and two main oil companies 60 billion
 CFA francs  ($131 million) in lost revenue, according to the
labor union that organized the walkout.  The strike, which started April 1, halted the operations of
 Total SA (FP) ’s Gabon unit and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s branch in the
central African nation, according to Guy Aurat Reteno, head of
the National Organization of Oil Employees, who spoke on
national radio today.  “The strike by ONEP recalls once again the dominance of the
oil sector in the national economy,” he said. The strike ended
yesterday after reaching a deal with the government over alleged
illegal workers in the industry. Total and Shell both said they
resumed operations after the dispute ended.  A previous strike in 2008 cost an estimated 6 billion
francs, Aurat Reteno said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
