The  Bank of England  should raise
rates a quarter percentage point today to deal with inflation
and bolster the pound,  Charles Goodhart , a former member of the
Monetary Policy Committee said, the London-based Times reported.  Goodhart, a London School of Economics professor and a
member of the Times’s “shadow” MPC, said a shift in policy is
called for following published research by the government’s
Office of Budget Responsibility indicating damage being done by
high inflation, the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
