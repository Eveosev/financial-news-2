Kenya’s Truth, Justice and
Reconciliation Commission summoned Bethuel Kiplagat, who
temporarily stepped down as its chairman last year, for a public
hearing into the Wagalla massacre, the  Daily Nation  reported.  Human rights groups estimate 3,000 people were killed in
February 1984 at the Wagalla airstrip in northeastern Wajir,
after Kenyan security forces detained ethnic Somalis from the
Degodia clan, the Nairobi-based newspaper said today.  The government says 57 people died in the execution,
according to the newspaper. Kiplagat was permanent secretary in
the foreign affairs ministry when the incident occurred, it
said.  Kiplagat stepped down from the Truth Commission in November
after a panel was appointed by the government to examine
allegations of his alleged involvement in human rights
violations going back decades. Kiplagat is among 42 former
Kenyan security officials the commission has called to appear
before it, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
