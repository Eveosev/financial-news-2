Indian imports of power-station coal
rose by 33 percent to 65.7 million metric tons in the year
ending March 2011 from 49.4 million a year earlier,  India Coal
Market Watch  said, citing estimates based on port data.  Indonesia shipped 43 million tons while  South Africa 
supplied 19 million, the coal newsletter said. Demand for the
fuel from power plants may rise to 750 million tons in 2017 from
an estimated 500 million this year, it said, citing data from
Indiaâ€™s Planning Commission.  Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. may award a tender in 30
days for supply of 1 million tons of imported coal, the
newsletter said separately, citing an unidentified official from
the state utility. The company issued a tender in March for the
supply of the fuel between June 2011 and March 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
