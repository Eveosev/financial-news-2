U.S. apartment vacancies dropped to
the lowest in almost three years in the first quarter as the
weak homebuying market fueled demand in what is usually a slow
period for rentals, according to  Reis Inc. (REIS)   The vacancy rate declined to 6.2 percent from 8 percent a
year earlier and 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, the
New York-based research firm said in a report today. The rate
was the lowest since it reached 6.1 percent in the second
quarter of 2008.  Unemployment of close to 9 percent and a surge in home
foreclosures have pushed many people to rent, driving a rebound
in multifamily properties during the past year. Construction of
apartments has climbed from a 50-year low on expectations that
rents will increase and more people will seek to lease.  “There is a bias against homeownership at this point,
especially if you feel  home prices  won’t rise and you can
wait,” Victor Calanog, chief economist at Reis, said in a
telephone interview. “Most of the applications for construction
and building loans are for multifamily buildings.”  Apartment owners had a net increase in occupied space of
more than 44,000 units, the most for a first quarter since 1999
and almost double the number from a year earlier, Reis said. The
first quarter tends to be a slow period for rentals since more
leases are signed in the warmer months, the company said.  About 6,000 units came to market during the first quarter,
the fewest since Reis began compiling data in 1999.  Rents Increase  Effective rents, or what tenants actually pay, increased in
75 of the 82 markets Reis tracks, to an average $991 a month
from $967 a year earlier and $986 in the fourth quarter.
Landlords’ asking rents also climbed, to $1,047 from $1,027 a
year earlier and $1,043 in the previous quarter, according to
the report.  San Jose ,  California , had the most growth in effective
rents during the past year, with 5.2 percent, followed by
suburban  Virginia  and  New York City , according to Reis.
Effective rents declined 1.5 percent in Las Vegas during the
year and grew the least in Orlando,  Florida ; and Colorado
Springs, Colorado.  New York had the lowest apartment vacancy rate in the first
quarter at 2.8 percent, followed by  New Haven ,  Connecticut ; and
Minneapolis, the report said. Memphis,  Tennessee , had the
highest vacancy at 11 percent, followed by Jacksonville,
Florida; and Houston.  Homeownership Declines  With the foreclosure rate at a record 4.63 percent in the
fourth quarter, thousands of homeowners have been forced into
apartments. Homeownership in the U.S. dropped from a peak of
69.2 percent in 2004 to 66.5 percent at the end of 2010, with
each percentage point representing about 1.1 million households,
according to the Census Bureau.  Developers have stepped up rental projects in anticipation
of rising demand.  AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB) , the second-biggest
publicly traded U.S. apartment owner, started 11 developments in
2010 with a combined 2,446 apartment units.  Still, new construction has been uneven. Starts on
multifamily homes, including townhouses and apartments, tumbled
46 percent in February to an annual rate of 104,000, after
reaching a two-year high in January, the Commerce Department
said March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
