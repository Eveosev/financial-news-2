Richards Bay Coal Terminal,  Africa ’s
largest export terminal for the fuel, shipped 5.2 percent less
coal in March than it did a year earlier as derailments hindered
deliveries to the port.  The terminal, on  South Africa ’s eastern coast, exported
5.36 million metric tons during the month, compared with 5.66
million tons a year ago, RBCT said in a  report  posted on its
website today.  The terminal’s owners, which include  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Total SA (FP)  among others, are
trying to boost exports to take advantage of rising prices for
the fuel. Shipments to the terminal, which can export 91 million
tons a year, have been constrained by freight rail accidents.  Rail operator Transnet Ltd. last week said that two coal
lines to the terminal were shut after a derailment. One of the
lines remains closed, Sandile Simelane, spokesman for the
company’s freight-rail unit, said by mobile phone today.  Coal shipped through RBCT rose 46 percent to an average of
$121.40 a ton in March, up from $83 a year earlier, according to
data from Hampshire-based IHS McCloskey on Bloomberg.  The terminal received 5.62 million tons of coal during the
month, 5.2 percent less than a year earlier, RBCT said.
Stockpiles rose 9.8 percent to 3.08 million tons at the end of
March from the previous month, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
