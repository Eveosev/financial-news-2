Oil traded near its highest price in
30 months for a second day as the euro rallied to a 14-month
peak against the dollar before the  European Central Bank  meets,
boosting the appeal of commodities as a hedge against inflation.  Futures pared earlier losses in  New York  as the euro
appreciated against most of its 16 major counterparts. The ECB
will increase its main rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent
tomorrow, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. An
Energy Department report today may show U.S. crude stockpiles
rose for a fifth week, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “Central bankers can have a greater influence on  oil
prices  than OPEC,” said  Olivier Jakob , managing director of
consultants Petromatrix GmbH in Zug, Switzerland. “We cannot
exclude that some of the macro-funds are positioning
themselves” for a rally sparked by a rate increase, he said.  Crude for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
was down 6 cents at $108.28 at 12:51 p.m. London time, after
falling as much as 62 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $107.72. The
contract traded at $108.78 a barrel on April 4, the highest
front-month price since Sept. 24, 2008.  Brent for May settlement on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange was 27 cents higher at $122.49 a barrel. Yesterday, the
contract rose $1.16, or 1 percent, to $122.22, the highest
settlement since Aug. 1, 2008.  Crude inventories in the U.S. probably rose 2 million
barrels in the week ended April 1, from 355.7 million
previously, according to the median estimate of 15 analysts
before the Energy Department’s report today. Yesterday, the
industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  said supplies fell
2.8 million barrels to 354.3 million.  Rebels in Libya retreated from the central oil port of
Brega under heavy artillery fire from forces loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi , as the opposition prepared to export crude for the
first time since the conflict began on Feb. 15. Libya, a member
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is
Africa’s third-largest producer.  The euro appreciated as much as 0.7 percent to $1.4317, the
strongest rate against the U.S. currency since Jan. 19, 2010,
and traded at $1.4293 as of 12:51 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
