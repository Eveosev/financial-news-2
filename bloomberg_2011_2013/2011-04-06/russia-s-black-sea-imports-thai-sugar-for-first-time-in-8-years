Russia ’s Black Sea ports are
importing raw sugar from  Thailand , the world’s second largest
exporter of the sweetener, for the first time in eight years in
order to save money, the Moscow-based Institute for Agricultural
Market Studies said today.  As much as 200,000 metric tons of raw sugar are being
shipped to the  Black Sea region  from Thailand, a “very rare”
move, according to Swiss Sugar Brokers. About 90,000 tons of
Thai sugar will be delivered to Russia in April, including
66,000 tons to the Black Sea ports, said Yevgeny Ivanov, an
analyst at the institute also known as IKAR.  The Black Sea region usually imports sugar from top
producer  Brazil . Russia accounts for about 80 percent of
deliveries to the region, IKAR said.  “The Thai premium is usually much more expensive than the
premium for sugar from Brazil, as the Far East is always in
deficit,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at the Rolle, Switzerland-
based company, said in an e-mail today. “This year the Thai
crop is huge and premiums collapsed, becoming cheaper than
Brazil.”  Ivanov said the Russian buyers need a good discount to
justify buying from Thailand.  Sugar for April loading in Brazil is 2.40 cents a pound
more expensive than the May futures in  New York , while Thai
sugar for loading until May 15 is 1.50 cents a pound more
expensive than May futures, data from the brokerage shows.  Thailand’s Production Rises  This season’s production in Thailand rose almost 12 percent
from a year earlier to 7.57 million tons through March 20,
researcher F.O. Licht said in a report. Output for the season
may still reach an all-time high, it said.  Russia will import less than 1 million tons of raw sugar in
the second quarter, according to the brokerage. The country
imported 1.14 million tons between April and June last year, and
932,000 tons in the same period in 2009, according to IKAR.  Ports in Russia’s  Far East  last year imported 16,000 tons
of Thai sugar, according to IKAR. Total raw sugar deliveries to
Russia in April and early May will be about 766,000 tons, IKAR
said.  Russia cut the raw-sugar import duty on Feb. 24 to as
little as $50 a ton from $140 a ton to the end of July, when the
rate will increase to at least $140 a ton when the domestic
sugar beet crop comes on to the market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
