Georgian authorities detained a
scrap-metal hunter for cutting a main Internet cable near
Tbilisi, the Interior Ministry said.  The break in the cable left tens of thousands of residents
and businesses without  Internet access  in Georgia and all of
 Armenia  on March 28, the ministry said.  A 75-year-old woman was arrested on evidence given by
several witnesses and was “temporarily released due to her old
age,” ministry spokesman Zurab Gvenetadze said today in a phone
interview in Tblisi.  She will be questioned again and may face
charges, Gvenetadze said.  The incident cut Armenia’s Internet access for more than 12
hours, Gvenetadze said. An unidentified spokeswoman for  Caucasus
Online , one of the largest Georgina Internet service providers,
said customers lost access to the World Wide Web for almost five
hours.  Georgian Railway Telecom LLC spokesman Giorgi
Ionatamishvili said the cable belonged to the company and
customers suffered “massive and catastrophic” damage.  Georgia 
provides 90 percent of Armenia’s Internet.  “We don’t how she found the optic cable, which was
secure,” Ionatamishvili said, adding that severe weather and
mudslides may have exposed the cable to copper hunters.  In 2008, Caucasus Online started a $76 million fiber-optic
link to Western Europe after a delay caused by the former Soviet
republic’s five-day war with  Russia  in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
