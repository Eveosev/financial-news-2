Pakistan’s budget deficit may exceed
the government’s target this year because of higher spending,
including the cost of fighting militants in tribal areas,
according to the  Asian Development Bank .  The South Asian nation revised its fiscal deficit target
for the year ending June 30 to 5.5 percent from 4 percent
because of higher food and energy costs, escalating subsidies
and reducing  tax revenue .  “That revised target is a bit unrealistic to us,” Rune
Stroem, the country director of the Manila-based lender, told
reporters in Islamabad today. “There are signals that this
target will slip further.”  Pakistan needs funds to bridge the deficit as it fights a
war against Taliban guerillas in the country’s northwest that is
taking a toll on businesses and the economy.  The country’s economic growth is likely slow to 2.5 percent
this year from 4.5 percent in the previous fiscal year as
monsoon flooding destroyed homes and crops and power shortages
hampered industrial growth, the bank said in its Asian
Development Outlook 2011 report today.  Pakistan ’s $168 billion economy is lagging behind as
emerging markets from neighboring India to  China  help lead the
global economic rebound from the deepest postwar recession.  Pakistan’s central bank kept the discount rate unchanged at
14 percent last month for a second straight meeting to support
economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
