Kuwait  is negotiating with
international  oil companies  operating in neighboring Iraq to
import gas from there,  Al-Jarida  reported, citing people
familiar with the matter.  The imports may take a maximum of a year and a half to
start, and the amount and value of gas to be imported “has not
yet been decided,” according to Al-Jarida. Kuwait is not in
talks with the Iraqi government on gas imports, the newspaper
said.  ----With assistance from Anthony DiPaola in Dubai. Editor: Chris
