The Czech benchmark  stock index  rose
to its highest in 2 1/2 months after factory orders in Germany,
the Czech Republic’s main trading partner, rose more than
expected.  The PX equity gauge climbed 0.9 percent to 1,275.4 by 4:25
p.m. in Prague, its highest close since Jan. 18. Austria’s  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS) , which accounts for 18 percent of the index’s
weighting, jumped 1.3 percent to 885 koruna, its highest close
in a week. Czech power utility  CEZ AS (CEZ)  added 0.6 percent to 893
koruna.  European equities gained for a third day after Germany said
factory orders in the continent’s biggest economy expanded more
than economists forecast. Vienna-based Erste expects provisions
for bad loans to decline to their “pre-crisis level” by 2013,
Chief Executive Officer Andreas Treichl said today.  “Erste’s rally was supported by its chief’s optimistic
outlooks,” analysts at Cyrrus brokerage in Brno,  Czech
Republic , wrote in a report today. “CEZ shares keep benefitting
from power prices above 60 euros per megawatt-hour.”  Electricity for next-year delivery in neighboring Germany,
where CEZ exports some of its surplus output, gained today to as
much as 60.35 euros per MWh. The contract, which rose to its
highest in nearly two years of 60.8 euros on April 4, last
traded at 60 euros per MWh.  Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA)  rose for a second day after
the Czech bookmaker said yesterday it will start a lottery three
months earlier than planned. The stock rose 1.4 percent to 109
koruna, its highest closing price since the Amsterdam-registered
company began trading in  Prague  on Oct. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
