Japan ’s 10-year yields may decline
to 0.5 percent by the first quarter of next year, even as the
nation sells additional debt to pay for rebuilding after its
strongest earthquake, according to Barclays Capital Japan Ltd.  Benchmark yields are projected to reach the lowest level
since June 2003 because the government of Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  will likely sell fewer additional bonds than Taro Aso’s
administration did in the wake of the global financial crisis,
said  Chotaro Morita , chief strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.  “Japan’s government has the financial resources to pay for
reconstruction, such as money in reserve for the fiscal 2011
budget,” Morita said at a forum hosted by Barclays in Tokyo
yesterday. “So additional bond issuances may be limited” to
zero to 8 trillion ($93.6 billion) yen.  Ten-year yields reached a two-month low of 1.145 percent on
March 15 after the March 11 quake and tsunami that triggered a
nuclear crisis. Yields rose to 1.305 percent yesterday as some
legislators advocated that the  Bank of Japan  buy debt directly
from the government to pay for the reconstruction.  Ten-year yields won’t likely exceed 1.35 percent reached on
Feb. 9, Morita said. The rate will decline to 0.9 percent by the
end of 2011 and to as low as 0.5 percent during the first three
months of 2012, ending the quarter at 0.7 percent, he said.  Yields will reach 1.28 percent by year-end and 1.26 percent
by March 2012, according to the weighted average forecasts of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Japan’s gross domestic product will contract in the three
months through June, before expanding in the following quarter
as relief efforts push up growth, Morita said. Still, Japan’s
yields won’t likely move in line with the domestic economy
alone, and may be pushed down by a cyclical slowdown in the
global economy in the latter half of this year, he said.  “Downward pressure on yields may be stronger than expected
once the momentum of economic expansion slows,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
