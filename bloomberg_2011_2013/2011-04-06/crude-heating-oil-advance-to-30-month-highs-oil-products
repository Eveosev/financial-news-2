Crude oil  rose to a 30-month high
and heating oil extended its 31-month high as NATO escalated its
air campaign over  Libya , bolstering concern the conflict will
spread to other energy-exporting countries in the region.

a 32-month high. Ethanol also declined.  Crude Oil  Crude oil for May delivery rose 49 cents to $108.83 a

pushing us higher,” said Sean Brodrick, a natural resource
analyst with  Weiss Research  in Jupiter,  Florida . “The situation
in Libya may be getting worse and could easily drag on for
months. There are also elections in  Nigeria , which could further
disrupt supply.”  Prices dropped as much as 0.6 percent during the session
when the U.S. Energy Department reported that crude oil
stockpiles climbed 1.95 million barrels to 357.7 million. A 2
million-barrel gain was projected, according to the median
estimate of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. Days of

million, the Energy Department reported. The decline was the
seventh in a row. Days of supply advanced for the first time in

planned work at BP Plc’s  Texas  City refinery in Texas remain
