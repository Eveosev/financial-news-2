AMAG Austria Metall AG, owned by
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s One Equity Partners LLC unit, received
orders for all the stock for sale in its initial public
offering, according to a document obtained by Bloomberg News.  The aluminum producer earlier today narrowed the price
guidance for its Vienna offer to 19 euros to 21 euros a share
from 19 euros to 24 euros announced on March 24. AMAG also
reduced the number of existing shares in the sale to 14 million,
from 16.99 million shares, according to the termsheet obtained
by Bloomberg. AMAG still plans to raise 100 million euros ($143
million) from selling primary shares, terms show.  Today’s changes mean that the company will list with a
market value of 366 million euros to 394 million euros. AMAG may
have a market value of as much as 453 million euros if investors
take up the overallotment option, according to the termsheet.  The book, which was more than 90 percent covered with more
than 70 accounts when AMAG narrowed its price range, will close
at 5 p.m. in Vienna today.  BNP Paribas SA and JPMorgan are managing the IPO, along
with Erste Group Bank AG, Raiffeisen Centrobank AG and UniCredit
Bank Austria AG. Regional lenders Raiffeisenlandesbank
Oberoesterreich AG and Oberbank AG each agreed to buy 5 percent
of AMAG via the offer.  AMAG is Vienna’s first IPO since builder Strabag SE’s offer
in October 2007. Austria’s benchmark ATX stock index has doubled
since March 2009. Isovoltaic AG, the world’s biggest maker of
backsheets for solar modules, started its IPO in the Austrian
capital on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
