President  Dennis Lockhart  said he doesn’t expect the central
bank to tighten U.S. monetary policy by the end of the year with
inflation low and the economic recovery fragile.  “I wouldn’t rule it out entirely, but at this stage I
personally am not leaning in the direction of thinking that is
absolutely required,” Lockhart said to reporters today during
an Atlanta Fed conference at Stone Mountain, Georgia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
