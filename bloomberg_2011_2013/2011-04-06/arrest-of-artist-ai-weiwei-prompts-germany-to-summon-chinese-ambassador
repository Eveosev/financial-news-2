German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  summoned Chinese ambassador Wu Hongbo to discuss the
detention of Ai Weiwei, an artist who has close links with
 Germany  and planned to open a studio in the capital.  Earlier today, China attacked western governments, media
and human-rights groups for criticizing the detention, saying in
a commentary in the state-sanctioned  Global Times  website that
the artist “will pay a price for his special choice.”  “We are very worried about the continuing detention of the
Chinese artist Ai Weiwei,” Westerwelle, who is also vice
chancellor, said today in a statement on the Foreign Ministry’s
website. The ambassador was called in “to ensure that our clear
and unambiguous message reaches the Chinese government.”  The New York Times and  Associated Press  reported that Ai
was taken into custody on April 3 as he tried to board a Hong
Kong-bound plane in Beijing. Yesterday, the European Union and
U.S. State Department voiced concern about Ai’s disappearance.  Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung on April 4 published what it
said was Ai’s last interview before his arrest. He said the
Chinese authorities had destroyed his new studio in  Shanghai  and
prevented a planned exhibition in Beijing.  “Recently they have been putting more and more people in
jail, just because they write something on Twitter or on a
blog,” he told the newspaper.  While Ai collaborated on the design of the Olympic Bird’s
Nest Stadium in Beijing, working with the Swiss architects
Herzog & de Meuron, he has never been allowed to exhibit in
 China .  His work has been displayed many times in the West,
including a carpet of 100 million hand-painted, porcelain
sunflower seeds at the Tate Modern in  London  last year.  Earthquake Protest  In October 2009, Munich’s  Haus der Kunst  showed “So
Sorry,” an exhibition that included an installation called
“Remembering,” created specially for the façade of the museum.
It consisted of 9,000 backpacks to commemorate the
schoolchildren who died in the Sichuan earthquake. The artist
traced and published the names of the dead schoolchildren.  At that time, he was recovering from a brain hemorrhage
that he said was caused by a beating from Chinese police. He was
asked why he continues to challenge the regime.  “We have to give our opinion, we have to say something, or
we are a part of it,” he said then. “As an artist I am forced
to say something.”  To contact the reporters on the story:
