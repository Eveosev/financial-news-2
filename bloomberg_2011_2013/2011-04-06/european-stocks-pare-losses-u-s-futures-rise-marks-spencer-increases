European stocks pared losses as
German factory orders rose almost five times as much as forecast
in February. Asian shares were little changed and U.S. index
futures advanced.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc surged 5.5 percent after the
retailer reported sales that beat estimates and forecast
improved profitability. Commerzbank AG climbed 2.9 percent as it
detailed plans to repay government aid and said operating profit
is “above plan.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.2 percent to 281.4 at
11:04 a.m. in  London , a day after Federal Reserve minutes showed
U.S. policy makers are divided over whether to maintain record
stimulus past June. The benchmark measure has advanced 7.2
percent from this year’s low on March 16 as investors speculated
that the economic recovery will withstand  Japan ’s worst
earthquake on record and popular revolts in the Middle East and
north  Africa .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
