The  British Olympic Association 
suspended its legal action in a funding dispute with organizers
of the  London 2012 Olympics , it said today.  The U.K. Olympic group yesterday asked the Lausanne,
Switzerland-based of Court of Arbitration for Sport to
temporarily suspend the case while it seeks an “amicable”
solution to the row, BOA spokesman Darryl Seibel said in a phone
interview today.  The BOA took action against London organizers in a wrangle
over whether the association’s share of profit from the 2012
Games should include the Paralympics. Inclusion of the cost of
the Paralympics may shrink the surplus left over for the BOA,
which is responsible for the U.K.’s participation in the  Olympic
Games .  The association took the case to the CAS, the top sports
tribunal, after the  International Olympic Committee  ruled
against the BOA in the dispute.  Denis Oswald, chairman of the IOC coordination commission,
last week questioned the jurisdiction of the CAS in the funding
row at a press conference in  London .  “It’s a good thing that people are talking again,” IOC
spokesman Mark Adams said at a press briefing at the Sport
Accord conference in London today. The IOC is holding a two-day
meeting of its executive board in the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
