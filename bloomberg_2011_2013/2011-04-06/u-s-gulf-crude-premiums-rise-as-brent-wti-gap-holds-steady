U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened versus West  Texas  Intermediate as Brent oil’s
premium to the U.S. benchmark was little changed.  The gap between futures contracts for current delivery for
WTI and for Brent, its European counterpart, narrowed 36 cents
to $13.52 at 1:32 p.m. in  New York . The differential reached a
record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 15 cents to
$17.15 a barrel at 12:22 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium was
unchanged at $16.50 a barrel.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium to WTI gained 25 cents a barrel to $10.50. Poseidon’s
premium strengthened 5 cents to $10.75.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened 15 cents to $10 a
barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium strengthened 85 cents to $15.35.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to $3.35 a
barrel. WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium strengthened $1 to $13.25 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select
widened 35 cents to $15.85 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
