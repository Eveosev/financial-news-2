A stopwatch used on the moon to time
engine burns during the Apollo 15 mission goes up for sale at
Bonhams in  New York  on May 5.  The Bulova timepiece was consigned by Commander  Dave Scott 
and has a presale estimate of $120,000 to $180,000.  “As Dave Scott explained, in space you’ve got to have
backups on backups on backups,” said Matthew Haley, specialist
in space history at Bonhams. “So he used the Bulova stopwatch
alongside the computer system.”  Bonhams’s space-history auction, which is expected to bring
in more than $1.2 million, also includes a motion-picture camera
that recorded Apollo 14’s descent to the moon’s surface 40 years
ago.  Consigned by the mission’s lunar module pilot  Edgar
Mitchell , the 16 mm Data Acquisition Camera is expected to fetch
as much as $80,000.  The camera was mounted inside the lunar module, and
Mitchell turned it on five minutes before touching down on the
moon’s surface.  A similar 16 mm  camera used during Apollo 12  in 1969 is at
the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in  Washington ,
D.C. Due to weight restrictions, most data acquisition cameras
were left behind on the moon.  Flying Ham  “In the past few years astronauts have begun consigning
things to auction and collectors love it,” said Haley.
“There’s no better provenance.”  The space memorabilia on offer is not just from human
astronauts. There’s also a tag that once adorned the creature
who would become known as Ham, the first American space
chimpanzee.  During his flight, he was known only as Number 65. NASA
officials were afraid of a public relations backlash if some
calamity were to befall the animal.  Launched on Jan. 31, 1961 aboard Mercury-Redstone 2, the
monkey flew 157 miles into space, reaching a suborbital velocity
of 5,857 miles per hour, and performed all his lever-pushing
tasks perfectly.  After his triumphant return, Number 65 was renamed “Ham,”
after the Holloman Aerospace Medical Center in  New Mexico  where
he trained.  Ham’s neck tag will be offered at the sale, with an
estimate of $2,000 to $4,000.  Ham never returned to space, spending his post-flight life
in the  National Zoo in Washington , D.C. and then at the North
Carolina Zoo. He died in 1983.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
