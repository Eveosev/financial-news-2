The U.S. is monitoring the
possibility of terrorist attacks originating in  Libya , either
from the forces of Muammar Qaddafi or rebels who may have
associated with terror groups in the past, FBI Director Robert Mueller said.  Authorities are questioning people previously affiliated
with the Libyan government and Libyans in the U.S. who may have
information on threats against Americans, Mueller said at a
House appropriations subcommittee hearing today.  The  Federal Bureau of Investigation  wants to “make certain
that we are on guard with the possibility of terrorist attacks
emanating somewhere out of Libya,” Mueller told lawmakers.  An allied assault on Qaddafi’s forces in Libya is
continuing. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization escalated its
air campaign over Libya a day after a rebel commander criticized
the alliance for not doing enough to stop Qaddafi’s artillery
attacks that pushed rebels into retreat. The U.S. and its allies
say they are seeking to enforce a United Nations-authorized
“no-fly zone” and to protect civilians from attacks by forces
loyal to Qaddafi.  The FBI is seeking interviews with those “previously
affiliated with the Libyan government who happen to be in the
 United States ” and are willing to provide information, Mueller
said.  He also described an “outreach effort” to students and
visitors from Libya with information “that may alert us to any
attempts at retaliation within the United States or elsewhere by
pro-Qaddafi individuals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
