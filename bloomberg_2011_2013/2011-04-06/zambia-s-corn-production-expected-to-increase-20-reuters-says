Zambia’s corn output for the 2010-11
season will probably increase 20 percent due to favorable
rainfall and higher yields, Reuters reported, citing Eustarckio
Kazonga, the minister of agriculture.  Preliminary figures show corn production will increase to
more than 3.3 million metric tons from 2.8 million tons a year
earlier, the news agency today cited Kazonga as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
