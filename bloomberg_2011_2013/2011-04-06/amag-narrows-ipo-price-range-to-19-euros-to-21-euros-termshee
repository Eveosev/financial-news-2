AMAG Austrian Metall AG, owned by
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s buyout arm One Equity Partners LLC,
narrowed the price guidance of its initial public offering to 19
euros to 21 euros a share, according to a termsheet obtained by
Bloomberg.  The aluminum producer on March 24 said the price range for
the Vienna offering was 19 euros to 24 euros. AMAG also reduced
the number of existing shares it is offering to sell 14 million
shares, from originally 16.99 million shares, according to the
termsheet. It still seeks to raise 100 million euros ($143
million) from selling primary shares, terms show.  Today’s changes mean that the final IPO size is 366 million
euros to 394 million euros or as much as 453 million euros given
sufficient demand for the overallotment option, according to the
termsheet.  The offering is more than 90 percent covered with more than
70 accounts in the book, the terms show. The book is to close at
5 p.m. in Vienna today.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and JPMorgan are managing the IPO, along
with  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , Raiffeisen Centrobank AG and UniCredit
Bank Austria AG. Regional lenders Raiffeisenlandesbank
Oberoesterreich AG and Oberbank AG each agreed to buy 5 percent
of AMAG via the offer.  AMAG’s is the first Vienna IPO since builder Strabag SE’s
offer in October 2007 as Austrian companies take advantage of a
doubling in the country’s key ATX stock index since March 2009
to sell shares. Isovoltaic AG, the world’s biggest maker of
backsheets for solar modules, started its initial public
offering in the Austrian capital on April 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
