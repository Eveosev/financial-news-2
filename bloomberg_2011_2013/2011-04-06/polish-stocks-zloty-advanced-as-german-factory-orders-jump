The Polish stocks and the zloty
extended gains after a report showed factory orders in  Germany ,
the countryâ€™s biggest trading partner, rose almost five times as
much as economists forecast in February.  The benchmark WIG20 Index advanced 0.9 percent to 2,911.49
as of 12:18 p.m. in Warsaw. The zloty appreciated 0.2 percent to
3.9897 per euro, its strongest level in a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
