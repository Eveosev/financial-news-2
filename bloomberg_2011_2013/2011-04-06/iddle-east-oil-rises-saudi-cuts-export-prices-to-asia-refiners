Middle East crude oils rose on
speculation demand from refiners will climb amid surging
processing profits.  Oman oil for immediate loading increased $1.66, or 1.5
percent, to $115.32 a barrel today, according to Bloomberg data.
That’s the highest since August 2008. Dubai for loading in June
was up 1.5 percent at $114.89 and Murban crude climbed 1.4
percent to $118.36.  Demand for crude has climbed as refiners are ramping up

barrel today, up from $20.61 a month ago, according to data from
broker PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. cut the official prices for its May
