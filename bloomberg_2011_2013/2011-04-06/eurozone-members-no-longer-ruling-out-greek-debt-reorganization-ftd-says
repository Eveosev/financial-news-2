Several eurozone governments no
longer rule out a reorganization of Greek debt, amid concern
that  Greece  will be unable to borrow in capital markets next

unidentified government officials.  To increase the Greek aid package would be politically
impossible and an alternative plan is therefore needed, the
newspaper cited its informants as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
