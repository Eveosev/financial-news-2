Sweden’s economy will grow 3.5
percent this year and 2 percent in 2012, requiring the central
bank to continue raising  interest rates  at all its remaining
policy meeting this year, according to Danske Bank A/S.  “We also attach a distinct risk of one or more 50 basis
point hikes from the summer onwards,” the Copenhagen-based bank
said in a report today.  Headline inflation in the largest Nordic economy will
average 3.3 percent this year and 2.6 percent in 2012, the bank
estimates. The Riksbank, which has a 2 percent inflation target,
has raised borrowing costs five times since July, bringing its
benchmark repo rate to 1.5 percent in February.  In neighboring Norway, the mainland economy -- which
adjusts for energy and shipping income -- will grow 3.5 percent
in 2011 and 3.6 percent in 2012, the bank said in the same
report.  “The Norwegian recovery is probably moving into a new
phase, in which corporate expansion will play a greater role,”
the bank said. “The solid position of households should spur
strong growth in household demand for goods and services from
here.  Norway ’s central bank will probably raise rates in May with
another two increases this year and five in 2012, Danske Bank
estimates. Oslo-based Norges Bank has left its benchmark deposit
rate on hold at 2 percent since May last year.  “With signs of capacity restraints beginning to emerge in
the economy, we expect the Norwegian krone to remain relatively
strong,” the bank said.  The economy of  Denmark , which pegs its krone to the euro,
will grow 2.1 percent in 2011 and 1.6 percent in 2012, Danske
estimates. The economy of  Finland , the only Nordic country that
uses the euro, will expand 3.2 percent this year and 2.5 percent
in 2012, Danske Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
