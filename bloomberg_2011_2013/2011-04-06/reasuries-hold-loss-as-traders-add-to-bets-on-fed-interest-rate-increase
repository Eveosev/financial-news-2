Treasuries fell for a second day,
pushing yields on the 10-year note to a four-week high, as
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will maintain stimulus measures
sent inflation expectations to almost three-year highs.  The yield gap between five-year Treasury notes and
inflation-indexed debt swelled to the widest since July 2008 as
the dollar slumped and gold and silver climbed to record levels.
The Treasury will announce tomorrow that it will auction $66
billion in notes next week, a Bloomberg News survey showed, even
if the government shuts down.  “With the doves still in control at the Fed, the idea is
that maybe the Fed could fall behind and not be aggressive
enough in fighting inflation as they should be,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of government and agency
debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and
dealer for institutional investors.  Ten-year yields increased seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 3.55 percent at 5:19 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It was the highest
level since March 9. The 3.625 percent note due in February 2021
fell 17/32, or $5.31 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 5/8.  Thirty-year bond yields climbed nine basis points to 4.59
percent and touched 4.60 percent, the highest since March 10.
Two-year yields rose two basis points to 0.83 percent.  The difference between yields on five-year notes and
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, known as the break-even
rate, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices over
the life of the debt, reached 2.41 percentage points, the widest
since July 2008. The 10-year break-even rate touched 2.59
percent after gaining to 2.60 percentage points yesterday, also
the widest since July 2008.  Treasury Auctions  The U.S. will sell $66 billion next week in 3-, 10- and 30-
year securities, the same as last month, according to a
Bloomberg survey of nine of the Fed’s 20 primary dealers. The
Treasury sold $72 billion of the three securities in February.
It will announce tomorrow the amounts to be sold.  The Treasury will conduct regular auctions even if the
government shuts down, an official told Bloomberg News on April
4. Congressional Democrats and Republicans raced to reach a
spending compromise to avert a closure on April 8, when existing
spending authority expires.  Gained in Shutdowns  U.S. government debt  rose during two shutdowns of the
federal government in 1995 and early 1996, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Treasury Master index. It gained
0.3 percent in the first closing, from Nov. 13-17, 1995, and
advanced 0.8 percent during the second, from Dec. 15, 1995, to
Jan. 5, 1996. Yields on two-year notes fell four basis points to
5.44 percent during the first shutdown, Bloomberg data show, and
slid 19 basis points to 5.17 percent in the second.  The dollar dropped today against most of its major
counterparts as the  European Central Bank  was poised to raise
interest rates at a meeting tomorrow. The ECB will boost its
main rate by 25 basis points from a record low 1 percent,
according to all 57 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Gold for June delivery reached a record $1,466.20 an ounce,
while silver for May delivery rose to $39.785 an ounce, a 31-
year high.  Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart  said he doesn’t
expect the central bank to raise interest rates by year-end. Low
inflation and a fragile economic recovery make tightening
unlikely in 2011, Lockhart told reporters today during an
Atlanta Fed conference at Stone Mountain,  Georgia .  Cut Unlikely  St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said in a Wall Street
Journal interview he’ll push at the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting this month to lower the Fed’s bond-buy program
by $100 billion. He held out little hope of being successful.  The Fed announced in November a plan to buy up to $600
billion in Treasuries through June to spur economic recovery.
Policy makers have kept the benchmark interest rate at zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008 to support the economy.  Minutes released yesterday of the FOMC’s March 15 meeting
showed a “few” among the central bank’s 17 governors and
regional bank presidents said tighter credit may be warranted
this year, while a “few others noted that exceptional policy
accommodation could be appropriate beyond 2011.”  The central bank bought $1.97 billion of securities
maturing from August 2028 to February 2041 today as part of its
asset-purchase program.  The  U.S. economy  will expand at a rate of 3.1 percent this
year, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. It will
outpace the U.K., which is forecast to expand 1.7 percent, and
the euro-region which economists predict will grow at a rate of
1.7 percent, the surveys show.  Bill Rates  Six-month bill rates slipped one basis point to 0.1302
percent after touching a record low 0.1099 percent on April 4.
Three-month rates declined to 0.0558 percent after reaching
0.0304 percent on April 4 and 5, the lowest since January 2010.  Six- and three-month bill rates have declined amid a change
in bank deposit-insurance fees and as the Treasury cut to $5
billion from $200 billion the amount of outstanding
Supplementary Financing Program bills it sells on behalf of the
Fed in a program set up in 2008 to support the financial system.
The reduction was made for reasons including the approach of the
federal debt limit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
