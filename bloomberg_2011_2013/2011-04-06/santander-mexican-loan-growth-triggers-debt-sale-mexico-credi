Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s Mexico unit may
follow  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ’s subsidiary in
selling international bonds after banks in the country borrowed
the most pesos in nine years to finance credit growth.  Grupo Financiero Santander SA may sell dollar notes to
yield 10 to 20 basis points less than the 4.337 percent on BBVA
Bancomer SA’s 5-year bonds sold in March, said Eduardo Cortes,
who helps manage $1.5 billion in debt at Gia Partners LLC in  New
York . Bancomer’s foreign sale was the first by a Mexican bank in
eight months after lenders boosted peso debt offerings 335
percent to about 70.9 billion pesos ($6 billion) in the past
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Lending growth will pick up in  Mexico  to about 20 percent
this year  from  8 percent in 2010 as the economy expands for a
second year after its worst recession since 1995, the nation’s
banking association said. The forecast tops the 13 percent loan
growth forecast by  Brazil ’s central bank for 2011. Santander’s
Mexico unit may sell foreign bonds for the first time in more
than a decade after placing 10.4 billion pesos of local debt
this year, Chief Executive Officer Marcos Martinez said.  “We’re also interested in issuing abroad,” Martinez said
in an interview yesterday at Bloomberg’s office in Mexico City.
“There are some maturities and some instruments that we think
can be attractive not only in terms of price but also so that
our institution can be known as an important, serious and good
issuer.”  Yield Falls  Santander is planning an initial public offering in Mexico
in the next two years, as part of a larger plan to sell shares
in  Argentina  and the U.K. to diversify risk after the global
financial crisis, he said.  “This is a resource to finance ourselves,” Martinez said.
“When you list in the local market, you have deeper roots.”  The yield on Santander’s 8.91 percent peso bonds maturing
in 2021 has dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point,
to 8.72 since they were sold March 16. The rate on Bancomer’s
7.83 percent peso bonds due in 2020 has dropped 3 basis points
to 8.9 percent in the same period. The government’s 8 percent
note due in 2020 yields 7.365 percent, down 8 basis points.  BBVA, based in Bilbao,  Spain , and Madrid-based Santander
are both rated AA by  Standard & Poor’s , and their Mexico City
units have Aaa ratings from Moody’s Investors Service.  Santander’s Mexico unit, the nation’s fourth-largest bank
by loans, will get cheaper financing on international markets
than Bancomer because it’s “more well known because of their
huge global presence,” said Cortes, who doesn’t hold any bonds
sold by banks in Mexico. “We may pay attention to this debt.”  Debt Swaps  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
7 basis points to 7.723 percent, according to Banco Santander.
The price rose 0.64 centavo to 119.14 centavos per peso. The
drop in yields was the most since Jan. 24 after central bank
Governor Agustin Carstens said that the 4.5 percent benchmark
lending rate is “adequate.”  Yields on the interbank rate futures contract, known as
TIIE, maturing in July fell 1 basis point to 4.97 percent.  The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years was little changed at 100, according to CMA. Credit-
default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or cash equivalent if the issuer fails to
comply with debt agreements.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Mexican dollar
bonds instead of  U.S. Treasuries  narrowed five basis points to
125, according to JPMorgan.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 11.80640 per dollar and is
up 4.6 percent this year.  Credit Growth  Total lending in Mexico rose 8.5 percent in January from a
year earlier to 2.137 trillion pesos, according to the National
Banking and Securities Commission. In Brazil, lending increased
21 percent in February from a year earlier, according to the
most recent central bank data.  Brazilian central bank President Alexandre Tombini told
lawmakers March 22 that consumer credit growth above 15 percent
needs to be monitored closely. The central bank forecasts credit
growth of 13 percent in 2011, Tulio Maciel, acting head of the
bank’s economic research department, said March 29.  Banco Santander  will probably increase lending 20 percent
in Mexico this year, Martinez said. The company’s credit-card
loans and government lending will increase less than 20 percent,
while mortgages and loans to small- and medium-sized businesses
will expand more than 30 percent, Martinez said. Loans to
private companies will grow about 20 percent, he said.  “Demand is coming back much less in credit cards
specifically,” he said. “There’s more demand in payroll
lending.”  Mexico’s economy, the second-largest in Latin America after
Brazil’s, may expand as much as 5 percent this year after 5.5
percent growth in 2010, the most in 10 years, Finance Minister
 Ernesto Cordero  said last month. Brazil’s gross domestic product
may expand 4.1 percent, after growing 7.5 percent last year, the
fastest pace in more than two decades, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  U.S. Economy  Growth in the U.S., which buys 80 percent of Mexican
exports, may accelerate to 3.1 percent this year from 2.9
percent in 2010, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 68 economists. The U.S. rebound helped drive Mexican
exports to a record $298 billion last year.  As the economy expands, faster consumer price increases
will prompt Carstens to raise the overnight lending rate about
75 basis points to 5.25 percent by year-end, trading in 28-day
TIIE indicates. The bank has kept its benchmark lending rate at
a record low 4.5 percent since July 2009 to support the
economy’s recovery.  Inflation will accelerate to 3.92 percent this year,
according to a monthly central bank survey conducted in March
and released April 1. The median forecast was 3.94 percent in
February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
