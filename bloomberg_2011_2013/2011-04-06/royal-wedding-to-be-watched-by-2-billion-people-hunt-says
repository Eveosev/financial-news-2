The wedding of  Prince William ,
second in line to the British throne, and Catherine Middleton on
April 29 will be watched by about 2 billion people worldwide,
Culture Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  said.  Arrangements for the royal wedding are going well, Hunt
told Cabinet colleagues in London today, according to an e-
mailed summary of the meeting released by Prime Minister  David Cameron â€™s office. The wedding is likely to be a major global
event, he said.  William, 28, the grandson of  Queen Elizabeth II , has been
dating Middleton, 29, since 2003 after they met while studying
at St. Andrews University in  Scotland . Their wedding day will be
a U.K. public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
