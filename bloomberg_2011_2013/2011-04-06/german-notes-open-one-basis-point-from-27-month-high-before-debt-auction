Irish government debt led a rally by
bonds from  Europe ’s high-deficit nations amid speculation that
optimism the region’s fiscal crisis will be contained is
prompting investors to exit their bets on declining prices.  Spanish and Portuguese securities also advanced as the euro
reached its strongest level in more than 14 months.  Portugal ’s
10-year bonds snapped 11 days of declines, even as borrowing
costs rose at an auction of bills.  “It is a short-covering move,” said  Marc Ostwald , a
fixed-income strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. “These are
unstable markets. You will from time to time get these enormous
short squeezes.”  The yield on 10-year Irish bonds plunged 32 basis points to
9.37 percent as of 5:10 p.m. in London. The 5 percent security
maturing in 2020 rose 1.57, or 15.70 euros per 1,000 euro
($1,434) face amount, to 73.195. The spread over similar-
maturity German debt narrowed to as low as 585 basis points, the
least since Feb. 21. The yield on two-year Irish notes dropped
42 basis points to 9.04 percent.  Short sales occur when investors sell a security, hoping to
profit on a decline and buy it back more cheaply. A short
squeeze can occur when many short-sellers try to close their
positions at once, driving the bonds higher with their bids.  The euro rose as much as 0.9 percent to $1.4349.  Irish Banks  Ten-year Irish bonds rose for a fourth straight day as the
nation’s financial regulator, Matthew Elderfield, said the
government will only seek to share losses with Anglo Irish Bank
Corp.’s senior bondholders if more capital is needed. He ruled
out forcing losses on Bank of Ireland Plc, Allied Irish Banks
Plc, EBS Building Society, and Irish Life & Permanent Plc’s
senior bondholders at a Reuters conference in  London  today.  The yield on the 10-year Spanish bond fell as much as 10
basis points to 5.20 percent, its biggest decline since March
14. The spread over similar-maturity German debt narrowed to 178
basis points, the lowest level since Nov. 2.  Portugal’s borrowing costs increased at the sale of six-and
12-month bills, the second debt offering in five days. The
securities due March 2012 were auctioned today at an average
yield of 5.902 percent, the national debt agency said, up from
4.331 percent at a sale of 12-month bills on March 16. Portugal
also sold bills due October 2011 at an average yield of 5.117
percent. It sold 550 million euros of six-month bills on March 2
at an average yield of 2.984 percent.  “Conditions have improved,” said  Sean Maloney , a fixed-
income strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “There’s been a
continuing grinding tighter in most countries’ spreads. Those
bills were placed, albeit with a significant jump in yields.”  Portugal, Germany  Portuguese two-year notes rose, pushing the yield down 27
basis points to 8.87 percent. Ten-year bonds were higher after
falling for the past 11 days, with the yield falling 22 basis
points to 8.54 percent.  German 10-year bond yields reached the highest since August
2009, climbing as high as 3.44 percent. ECB President Jean- Claude Trichet said on March 3 that policy makers may raise the
key rate from a record low of 1 percent at a meeting tomorrow.
The two-year note yielded 1.84 percent after touching 1.86
percent, matching an April 1 peak when it reached the highest
since Dec. 19, 2008.  The nation sold 4.2 billion euros of two-year securities
today.  Greek notes slid, with the two-year yield rising 15 basis
points to 16.04 percent.  Several euro-region governments no longer rule out a
reorganization of Greek debt, amid concern that  Greece  will be
unable to borrow in capital markets next year, the Financial
Times Deutschland reported today, citing unidentified government
officials.  To contact the reporters on this story:
