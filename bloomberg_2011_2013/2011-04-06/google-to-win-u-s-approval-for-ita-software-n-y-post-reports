Google Inc. (GOOG)  is about to obtain U.S.
 Justice Department  approval for its $700 million acquisition of
ITA Software, the New York Post reported, citing a person close
to the situation.  While the department hasnâ€™t yet made a recommendation, it
it is inclined to grant antitrust approval any day, the
newspaper said.  The Justice Department is concerned that Google, which
wants ITA to create its own travel search service, may direct
users to its own site, putting rivals at a disadvantage, the
Post said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
