Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened the
most in three months after a report that showed inflation
accelerated to a four-month high in March.  Consumer prices rose 1.41 percent from a year earlier,
after having jumped 1.33 percent the previous month, the
government reported a few minutes before the 4 p.m. close of
trading in Taipei. The People’s Bank of China raised borrowing
costs yesterday for the fourth time since October.  “Investors expect Taiwan will follow China in raising
 interest rates  to tame inflation,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-
based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial
Bank. “That supported the local dollar today.”  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.6 percent from April 1 to
NT$29.150 against its U.S. counterpart as of the close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. That was its biggest one-day gain
since Jan. 7. The currency was trading 1.1 percent stronger at
NT$29.000, the strongest level since Feb. 11, one minute before
the close. The island’s financial markets were shut the last two
days for a public holiday.  The Central Bank of the  Republic of China  (Taiwan) raised
the discount rate on 10-day loans to banks by 0.125 percentage
point to 1.75 percent on March 31.  Bonds were little changed from April 1. The yield on the
1.375 percent note due March 2021, the most-traded government
security, was 1.363 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market, the island’s biggest exchange for debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
