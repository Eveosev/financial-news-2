exchange-traded funds while speakers at the CRU Copper
Conference include First Quantum Minerals Ltd. President  Clive Newall  and Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  Michael Widmer .  ECONOMY:
* Chile ’s economy expanded in February at the fastest pace since
August, exceeding economists’ estimates and cementing forecasts
the central bank will raise  interest rates  by a half-point next
week. The central bank’s monthly Imacec index, a proxy for gross
domestic product, rose 7.2 percent from the previous year, the
bank said in a statement on its website yesterday.  EQUITIES:

gains. Empresas CMPC SA increased 2.8 percent to 24,790 pesos.
Chile’s second-largest pulp exporter rose as investors bet that
a stock split the company is working on, for the takeover of
unit Industrias Forestales SA, will increase trading volume,
said Camila Pindar, an analyst at Corpbanca’s brokerage unit.  MARKETS:
*Chile’s peso strengthened to a one-month high, climbing 0.3
percent to 473.31 per  U.S. dollar .
*Chile’s central bank bought $50 million at an average of 474.99
pesos per U.S. dollar, part of a $12 billion plan to weaken the
peso, according to a statement on its website.
*Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market reduced
bets that the peso would fall against the dollar for a fourth
straight day to $1.9 billion on April 1, according to central
bank data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
