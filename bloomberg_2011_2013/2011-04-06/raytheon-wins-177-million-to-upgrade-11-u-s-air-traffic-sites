Raytheon Co. (RTN) , one of the Federal
Aviation Administration’s largest contractors, was awarded $177
million to replace air-traffic control displays at 11 centers
serving some of the busiest U.S. airports, the company said.  The air-traffic centers, where controllers guide planes
within 50 miles of takeoffs and landings, include  New York ,
Chicago, Atlanta,  Los Angeles , Dallas and Washington, Raytheon
said in a statement. The work is expected to be completed by
2015, Andy Zogg, a Raytheon vice president, said in an
interview.  The contract for the Raytheon project, called the  Standard
Terminal Automation Replacement System , or Stars, upgrades
processors and displays in the centers to help controllers more
precisely locate planes and spot storms. The Stars system serves
as a platform for future FAA upgrades to a satellite-based
system, Zogg said.  Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon won a $940 million
contract in 1996 to upgrade equipment at 172 centers at or near
airports with the Stars system. In 2004, when the program fell
years behind schedule and cost estimates rose to more than $2
billion, the FAA scaled back the plan to 50 sites and said it
would incrementally add other locations in future years.  Other centers that will get Stars as part of today’s
announcement include  St. Louis , Denver, Minneapolis,  Sacramento ,
California, and Louisville, Kentucky, according to Raytheon’s
statement. Work will begin with Dallas next year, and the first
five centers will be completed by 2013, Zogg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
