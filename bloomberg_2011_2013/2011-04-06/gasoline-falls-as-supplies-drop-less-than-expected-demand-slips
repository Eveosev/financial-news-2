Gasoline futures retreated after the
Energy Department reported a drop in inventories that was
smaller than expected as demand shrank and imports surged.  Futures slipped as gasoline stockpiles lost 357,000 barrels
to 216.7 million, the smallest drop in seven straight weeks of
declines. A survey by Bloomberg projected a slide of 1.9
million. Demand fell a second consecutive week and imports
jumped to a nine-week high.  “You may be coming to an end of these big draws,” said
 Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “The demand number is pretty
discouraging and you get a sense that refiners and importers are
getting ready to put more supplies into the marketplace.”  Gasoline for May delivery dropped 0.84 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $3.1929 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Yesterday, prices settled at the highest
level since July 21, 2008.  Gasoline demand, as measured by deliveries to wholesalers,
dropped 13,000 barrels to average 8.85 million barrels a day.
Measured on a four-week average, demand is 1.2 percent below a
year earlier.  “Anytime you see a negative demand number, it’s worth
looking at and it has to raise eyebrows when retail gasoline is
above $3.70 a gallon,” said  David Pursell , a managing director
at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in Houston.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 2.2 cents to $3.707 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on
its website. That’s the highest price since Sept. 23, 2008.  14-Week Low  Gasoline supplies are at a 14-week low after shedding 24.4
million barrels, or 10 percent, since Feb. 11, when they were
the highest in almost 21 years. Gasoline imports jumped 22
percent last week to 1.08 million barrels a day, the highest
level in nine weeks.  Production of gasoline rose 1.3 percent to 8.81 million
barrels a day. Refinery utilization rose 0.3 percentage point to
84.4 percent, the highest in eight weeks.  Stockpiles of distillates, including heating oil and
diesel, gained 195,000 barrels to 153.5 million. Distillate
inventories are 5.4 percent above a year earlier, according to
the department.  Distillate demand rose 1 percent to 3.67 million barrels a
day. The four-week average is 0.9 percent above a year earlier,
according to the department.  Heating oil for May delivery gained 0.62 cent to settle at
$3.1912, after earlier touching $3.2206, the highest level for
the front-month contract since Sept. 2, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
