J. Jill Group Inc., a specialty
retailer of women’s apparel, increased the interest rate it’s
offering lenders on a $120 million term loan to refinance
existing debt and to help fund its purchase by Arcapita Bank BSC
from Golden Gate Capital, according to a person with knowledge
of the deal.  Price guidance on the $120 million six-year term loan is
now 8.5 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate, up from 5.5 percentage points over Libor, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private. The
minimum on the lending benchmark is still 1.5 percent.  The discount on the loan has been increased to 97 cents on
the dollar from 98 cents, according to the person. Commitments
from lenders are due today at 5 p.m. New York time.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the transaction, said
the person. The financing package initially included a $40
million five-year asset-based revolving line of credit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
