Greta Garbo, the reclusive Swedish
Hollywood screen legend who died in 1990, will soon adorn the
Nordic nation’s 100-krona notes.  Garbo, a Stockholm native who died in  New York , is one of
six prominent 20th century Swedes to feature on the new bills,
the central bank said today. Director  Ingmar Bergman , Astrid
Lindgren, the author of Pippi Longstocking, opera diva Birgit Nilsson, troubadour Evert Taube and former United Nations
Secretary General Dag Hammarskjoeld were also selected.  “The new motifs reflect Sweden’s cultural heritage and
different parts of our country in a positive and representative
way,” Johan Gernandt and Leif Pagrotsky, chairman and vice
chairman, respectively, of the bank’s General Council, said in a
statement. “Of course, achieving an equal balance between women
and men has also been important.”  The bank will announce a design competition for the notes
and expects to reach a decision on the final design by the start
of 2012, “if no intellectual property law problems arise.” The
new notes will be issued in 2014 or 2015.  Sweden ’s current notes feature author Selma Lagerloef,
singer Jenny Lind, botanist Carl Linnaeus, and Kings Karl XI and
Gustav Vasa.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
