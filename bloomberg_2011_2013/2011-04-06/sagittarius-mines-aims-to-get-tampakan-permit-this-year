Sagittarius Mines Inc., an  Xstrata
Plc (XTA)  unit operating the Tampakan copper-gold project in the
Philippines, wants to get a permit from the government this year
to proceed with the project, a senior executive said in
Singapore today.  “We would want to get the approval completed this year,”
General Manager  Mark Williams  said. “SMI expects to commence
operation by the end of 2016,” the company said later in a
statement.  The Philippine government has banned open-pit mining, the
method Sagittarius and its partner,  Indophil Resources NL (IRN) , plan
to use for extraction at Tampakan, the largest untapped gold and
copper deposit in southeast Asia. Xstrata has been in talks with
provincial officials on the prohibition.  The $5.9-billion mine is estimated to produce an average
340,000 metric tons of copper and 350,000 ounces of gold a year
for two decades from 2016.  --Xiao Yu. Editors: Alan Soughley, Indranil Ghosh  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
