EVN AG (EVN) , Austriaâ€™s second-biggest
utility that runs power plants in southern  Bulgaria , started
construction on a 10-million lev ($7.3 million) solar park near
the Black Sea port of Burgas.  The installation will be completed by July, EVN said in an
e-mailed statement. Last year, EVN built a 6 million-lev solar
park near Sliven in southern Bulgaria, the company said.  The new park will have a peak capacity of 2 megawatts, and
the first park has capacity of 0.84 megawatts, EVN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
