Airbus SAS, the world’s largest
maker of passenger aircraft, ended the first three months of the
year with a net order of just one jet as cancellations on
narrow- and wide-body planes shrunk its intake.  The company, based in Toulouse in southern  France , had 68
cancellations from January to March, on a gross order intake of
69 units, Airbus said in a statement today. Airbus delivered 119
jets in the quarter, including four A380s. The company aims to
hand over about 24 double-decker A380s this year.  The cancellations included 43 A320s, one A330-200, 12
A330-200 freighter planes and 12 A350 900s. Airbus said in early
March that Dubai Aerospace Enterprise had dropped plans to buy
42 aircraft, including 18 single-aisle jets, 12 A350-900s and 12
A330 freighters. The company didn’t specify the cancellations
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
