Ghana  will start fixing prices for
shea nuts by forming a development board next year, in a bid to
encourage farmers to increase collection, Vice President John Mahama told a conference in Accra, the capital, today.  While he didn’t say what the price would be, Mahama said
the move to regulate the industry, which is dominated by women
in the north of the West African nation, will give the farmers
“adequate compensation.”  Ghana , the world’s second-largest cocoa producer after
 Ivory Coast , collects just 30 percent of the shea nuts grown in
the country, or 45,000 metric tons each year, said Joseph Samuel
Annan, deputy minister of trade and industry. About 9,000 women
are involved in shea harvesting, which earned $30 million in
2010, he said.  The nuts of the shea tree, which grows across the arid
Sahel region, are picked and processed into butter that is used
in cosmetics and food. Global exports of shea nuts and butter
increased in value to more than $120 million in 2010, from a $10
million a decade earlier, the U.S. Agency for International
Development said in a statement handed to reporters at the
conference.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
