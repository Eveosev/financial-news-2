Stress tests into whether European
banks can withstand 20 percent losses on sovereign debt holdings
may be too easy and lull investors into a false sense of
security, according to Brockhouse & Cooper Inc. strategists.  Prices of Irish, Greek and Portuguese government bonds show
investors may lose 30 percent, which isn’t reflected in the
credit spreads of banks in  Europe ’s stronger nations,  Pierre Lapointe  and Alex Bellefleur wrote in a note to clients.
Sovereign defaults usually cause losses of 50 percent or more,
they wrote.  Spreads have widened “only in banks located in problematic
countries,” the Montreal-based analysts wrote. “The German,
French and U.K. banking indices have barely budged over the
period. Are the banks in these countries immune to sovereign
risk?”  German banks have $568.6 billion at risk in Portugal,
Ireland, Spain and  Greece , 22.6 percent of the total, according
to the analysts. The French have $440.4 billion outstanding to
those nations and the British have $431 billion, they said.  A 30 percent haircut on loans to the peripheral nations,
including  Spain , would imply $754 billion of losses, a third of
the  International Monetary Fund ’s estimate of $2.28 trillion as
the cost of the 2007 subprime crisis, according to the analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
