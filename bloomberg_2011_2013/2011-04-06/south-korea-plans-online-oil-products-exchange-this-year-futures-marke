South Korea , relying on imports for
almost all its oil needs, plans to open an online exchange for
fuel products by the year-end and a futures market by 2012 to
boost transparency of trades.  The government will also lower regulatory barriers to enter
the oil trading industry, the  Ministry  of  Knowledge Economy  said
in an e-mailed statement today. SK Innovation Co., GS Caltex
Corp. and two other refiners virtually control the oil imports
business in South Korea, according to the statement.  Recent state-led surveys showed the current fuel-pricing
system is “restricting competition” and sometimes results in a
gap between global and domestic prices, the ministry said.
Promoting competition will contribute to lowering prices,
according to the statement.  Oil refiners are among the companies that President  Lee
Myung Bak ’s government has pressured to cut prices to tame
inflation after consumer prices climbed to the highest in 29
months in March. This week, SK Innovation and  S-Oil Corp. (010950) 
announced plans to reduce the domestic cost of gasoline and
diesel by 100 won (9 cents) a liter. GS Caltex also said it’s
considering cutting prices of oil products.  The four refiners and the National Agricultural Cooperative
Federation control 94 percent of the nation’s gas stations,
according to the statement.  The government is considering other means of keeping oil-
product prices stable, including allowing state-run energy
developer Korea National Petrochemical Corp. to trade in the
country’s wholesale fuel market, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
