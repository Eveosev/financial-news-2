Gold, little changed near a record
in New York, may climb as concerns about European debt and
rising inflation spur demand for an alternative investment.  The  European Central Bank  lifted  interest rates  for the
first time in almost three years to quell inflation even as
 Portugal  said yesterday it will seek a bailout. Gold futures
yesterday reached a record $1,463.70 an ounce. Prices have
climbed as fighting in Libya, Japan’s nuclear crisis and
concerns about European debt boosted demand for the metal as a
protector of wealth.  “Inflation uncertainty and geopolitical risks are still
high,” said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management
in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland. “Sovereign bankruptcy in the
European periphery is also supporting gold prices.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $1.50, or 0.1 percent,
to $1,460 an ounce by 8:02 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The
metal for immediate delivery in  London  was 0.1 percent lower at
$1,458.30.  Bullion fell to $1,456.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,461.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Portugal will seek a bailout from the European Union after
the nation’s political crisis pushed borrowing costs to record
levels and forced it to become the third country in the euro
region in need of a rescue. Portugal is aiming for a package
that may be worth as much as 75 billion euros ($107 billion),
two European officials with knowledge of the situation said.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization increased the number
of warplanes over Libya. The U.S. and  Italy  discussed how
coalition countries can “do more to help the opposition make
very fast progress” against Muammar Qaddafi, U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton said after meeting her Italian counterpart
Franco Frattini.  Interest Rates  The ECB today raised the benchmark interest rate to 1.25
percent from a record low of 1 percent.  China  this week raised
rates for the fourth time since October to combat rising
consumer prices and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  this
week said inflation must be watched “extremely closely.”  Rising interest rates increase the opportunity cost of
holding non-interest-bearing commodities such as bullion.  The ECB rate increase “should be priced in to a large
extent,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said in a report to clients. “The effect on precious
metals should thus be limited.”  Gold will average $1,460 an ounce this year, up from a
previous forecast of $1,426, Standard Chartered Plc said today
in a report. Prices will average $1,650 next year, it said.  Silver for May delivery in  New York  rose 0.4 percent to
$39.53 an ounce after yesterday reaching $39.785, the highest
level since January 1980. That year, futures reached a record
$50.35.  Palladium for June delivery was little changed at $784.30
an ounce. Platinum for July delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1,792.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
