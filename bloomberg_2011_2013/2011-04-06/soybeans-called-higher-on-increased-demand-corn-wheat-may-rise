What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that rising energy
prices will boost demand for cooking oil used to make fuel, said
 Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president of the Linn Group in
Chicago. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.25 cent to
0.35 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures may open up
$2 to $3 for 2,000 pounds of the  animal feed .  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as dry weather threatens to reduce production in
the U.S., the biggest exporter, Huckabay said.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on speculation that a government report on
April 8 will show U.S. inventories before this yearâ€™s harvest
will be the lowest since before 1960, when measured as a
percentage of consumption, Huckabay said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
