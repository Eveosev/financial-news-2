Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the Persian
Gulf country’s biggest lender by assets, reported a greater-
than-estimated increase in first-quarter profit on higher income
from lending.  Net income rose 35 percent to 1.7 billion riyals ($467
million), or 3.4 riyals a share, from 1.27 billion riyals, or
2.5 riyals, a year earlier, the Doha-based bank said in a
statement today. The median estimate of three analysts was for
profit of 1.62 billion riyals, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Qatari banks are benefiting from an economy whose growth is
forecast by the  International Monetary Fund  to reach 19 percent
this year, the fastest pace in the world.  Qatar, which was awarded the right to host the soccer  World
Cup  in 2022, expects domestic investment in the five years
through 2016 to total 820 billion riyals, half of which will be
spent in the hydrocarbon industry, according to the report by
General Secretariat for Development Planning in March.  Qatar National Bank said first-quarter net interest income
and income from financing activities jumped 44 percent to 1.7
billion riyals in the quarter, while net fees and commission
income rose 1.3 percent to 285.2 million riyals.  Income from lending gained 20 percent to 140.7 billion
riyals and customer deposits advanced 36 percent to 179.9
billion riyals.  Qatar National Bank’s shares fell 4.8 percent on Feb. 6
following a central bank order for conventional lenders to shut
their Islamic-banking arms. The stock rose the most in a month
two days later after Qatar Islamic Bank SAQ said it may buy the
Islamic units of non-Shariah lenders. QNB Al Islami, Qatar
National Bank’s Shariah-complaint arm, accounted for 18 percent
of the company’s net revenue in 2009.  The lender rose 0.9 percent to 139.2 riyals in Doha trading
ahead of the results today. They have fallen 2.2 percent this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
