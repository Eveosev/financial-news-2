Ukrainian farmers planted 1.6
million hectares of spring grain as of yesterday, the
Agriculture Ministry said.  Wheat reached 137,000 hectares and barley 1.16 million
hectares, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. The
ministry sees total spring grain planting this year at 7.5
million hectares.  Sugar beet was planted across 86,000 hectares, or 15
percent of the total forecast, as of yesterday, the ministry
said. Sunflower planting reached 20,000 hectares, or 1 percent
of the entire areas planned for the crop.  Winter grain was fertilized across 6.7 million hectares,
which is 83 percent of all winter grain crops, the ministry
said. As much as 9 percent of the winter grain crop needs to be
re-sown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
