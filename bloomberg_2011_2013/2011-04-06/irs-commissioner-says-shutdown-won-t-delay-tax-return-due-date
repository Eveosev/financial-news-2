Internal Revenue Service
commissioner Douglas Shulman said the April 18 due date for
filing individual income tax returns will not change even if
other government functions shut down because of the budget
stalemate in Congress.  “File your tax returns,” he said in response to questions
today at the  National Press Club  in Washington. “We’re going to
be accepting returns. Electronically file, you’re not going to
see any delay.”  If the government shuts down, Shulman said, the IRS will
not process returns filed on paper, though it will continue to
process electronically filed returns. Other IRS operations,
including audits, will be curtailed or will cease during a
shutdown, an administration official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said earlier today.  About 70 percent of returns were electronically filed last
year, he said. E-filed returns cost 17 cents for the IRS to
process, he told a congressional committee last week, while
paper returns cost an average of $3.66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
