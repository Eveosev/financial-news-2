Kobe Steel Ltd.,  Japan ’s fourth-
largest mill, will start selling power-generation coal next
month, using its technology to turn low-quality coal into a
viable fuel.  The company is in talks with potential customers, including
a power company in Asia, to supply the fuel produced at the
coal-processing plant in Satui, South Kalimantan, Yukio Akazawa,
general manager at the Kobe, Japan-based company’s coal and
energy division, said yesterday in an interview in Singapore,
without identifying the companies.  Japan’s trade ministry and Kobe Steel opened the 8 billion
yen ($95 million) Indonesian plant in December 2008.  The plant processes lignite, or brown coal, which is used
by power companies.  Lignite’s tendency to self-combust and high-water content
make it less suitable for generating heat.  --Xiao Yu in  Singapore  and Masumi Suga in  Tokyo . Editors:
