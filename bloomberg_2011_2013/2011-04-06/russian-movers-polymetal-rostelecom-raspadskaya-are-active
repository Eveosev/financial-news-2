The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  gained 0.1
percent to 1,850.08 as of 1:07 p.m. in Moscow after losing 0.2
percent yesterday. The dollar-denominated RTS Index climbed 0.4
percent to 2,096.73.  The following are among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Polymetal (PMTL RX) advanced 2.4 percent to 573.6
rubles, its highest intraday price since Jan. 19. Gold rallied
to a record for a second day and silver reached a 31-year high.
The metals are the company’s main products.  OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)   increased 2.3 percent to 190.2
rubles after the shares dropped 1.6 percent yesterday following
an accident that halted operation at its Koksovaya mine in
Siberia. “The realization that the accident doesn’t have major
ramifications for production is mostly responsible” for today’s
rally, Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF Global
Trading on  London , wrote in an e-mail.  OAO Rostelecom (RTKM RX) jumped 3.8 percent to 177.69
rubles, the highest price since March 28. President Alexander
Provotorov told investors in a conference call today that the
company would now focus on developing fixed-line broadband
internet and subscription-funded television as well as becoming
a leading mobile-telephone operator, according to a research
note from RMG Research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
