The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 5 p.m. New York time.  The IPC index gained 0.1 percent to 37,861.81.  Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB (BOLSAA MM), the operator of
Mexico’s securities exchange, advanced 2.4 percent to 25.45
pesos. Interjet, a low-cost Mexican airline, will decide within
two weeks whether to hold an initial public offering, said
Miguel Aleman Velasco, the company’s founder and chairman. That
could mean increased revenue from fees for the exchange.  Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB (ASURB MM), the
operator of airports in southern Mexico, slipped 1.2 percent to
68.41 pesos. The company said its passenger traffic declined 2.3
percent in March from the same period a year earlier.  Vitro SAB (VITROA MM) fell 0.6 percent to 13.84 pesos. The
Mexican glassmaker that defaulted in 2009 said it will sell
assets at two U.S. units to an affiliate of Grey Mountain
Partners LLC, a private equity firm based in Boulder,  Colorado .  To contact the reporters on this story:
