Investec Plc (INVP) , the South African

embark on an initial public offering in Johannesburg next week
worth about 1.7 billion rand ($254.2 million).  “We see this fund as a platform from which we can grow and
expand,” Sam Leon, chief executive officer of the Johannesburg-
based Investec Property Fund Ltd., said in an e-mailed statement
today. It expects to report a profit of 20 million rand for the
year through March 2012, according to a separate statement sent
to Johannesburg’s stock exchange.  The unit has 29 properties in its portfolio, including
Investec’s offices in Durban and Woolworths House in  Cape Town .
The fund will continue to expand its portfolio after next week’s
listing, it said, adding that its date to go public is set for
April 14.  Investec, which maintains listings in London and
Johannesburg, rose 1 rand, or 1.9 percent, to 55.17 rand as of
3:55 p.m., its highest intraday level since Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
