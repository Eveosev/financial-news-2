Rio Tinto Group, bidding A$3.9
billion ($4.1 billion) for  Riversdale Mining Ltd. (RIV) , extended its
offer by two weeks after securing more than 47 percent of the
coal developer, triggering a higher price for the shares.  The offer rose to A$16.50 a share from A$16 as Rio’s stake
in Sydney-based Riversdale reached 49.49 percent, the London-
based company said today in a statement. The offer period was
extended to April 20, it said.  Riversdale’s next-largest shareholders, Brazil’s  Cia
Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3) , or CSN, and India’s  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ,
have also boosted their holdings since Rio bid for the company
in December, and own a combined 47 percent. Gaining control of
Riversdale’s projects in  Mozambique  would expand Rio’s reserves
of steelmaking coal as prices double.  CSN intends to remain a shareholder in Riversdale, Chief
Financial Officer Paulo Penido said on a conference call last
week with analysts. Tata’s Managing Director H.M. Nerurkar said
Feb. 21 his company wanted to retain its stake.  Riversdale advanced 0.3 percent to A$16.42 at the 4:10 p.m.
close in Sydney on the Australian stock exchange. Rio rose 0.4
percent to 4,430 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
