Colombia ’s agreement to rework  labor
laws  and protect union organizers will help the Obama
administration get Congress to pass three stalled free-trade
deals, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said.  “This gives us a pathway to now have a conversation with
Congress about when we would begin the process under trade
promotion authority for considering not only the Colombia free-
trade agreement, but Korea as well,” Kirk said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Television. “We expect to be in a good
position to wrap up Panama in the next couple weeks.”  The Colombia trade pact, signed in 2006, has languished
since President Barack Obama took office two years ago, as have
accords with  Panama  and South Korea.  To contact the reporters on this story:
