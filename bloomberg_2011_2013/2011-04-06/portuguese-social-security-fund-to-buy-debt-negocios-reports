Portugal ’s Social Security Financial
Stability Fund will take part in an auction today to buy the
country’s treasury bills, Jornal de Negocios reported, without
saying how it obtained the information.  The Social Security fund has been selling foreign assets in
the last few days to obtain liquidity to be able to take part in
today’s bill sale, the Portuguese newspaper said. The fund has
already been active in the market in the last few months helping
the Portuguese state obtain financing, according to Negocios.  The fund manages money that will ensure the payment of
retirement pensions in the future, Negocios reported. It manages
about 9.6 billion euros ($14 billion) of contributions,
according to the newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
