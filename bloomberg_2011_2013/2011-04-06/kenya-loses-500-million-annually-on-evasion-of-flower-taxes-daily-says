Kenya  may be losing 41.5 billion
shillings ($500 million) a year in unpaid taxes from
international companies involved in the flower industry,
Business Daily reported, citing a Christian Aid investigation.  The difference between the price at which flowers are
exported from the East African country and what they’re imported
for in  Europe  can’t be accounted for by transport costs alone,
the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  Kenya shipped flowers at $3.70 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) in
2009, while import prices were $8.08 and transport costs about
2.5 percent of the price per kilogram, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
