Roy Paul , deputy general manager at
Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai, comments on the outlook for India’s
rupee.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency
gained 0.4 percent to 44.94 per dollar as of 11:34 a.m. in
Singapore, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts reflect bets the rupee will weaken 1.5 percent from
the spot rate of 44.26.  “Of late, the capital inflows have been huge and that is
positive for the rupee. There is a global acceptance that India
is a growing economy so that is taking root in the minds of
investors.  “ Oil prices  at the current level are a dampener. Depending
on the Gulf region and what happens there, the high oil price is
a negative for the currency.  “The rupee will be around 45 against the dollar in three
months depending on the capital inflows and developments in the
Gulf.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
