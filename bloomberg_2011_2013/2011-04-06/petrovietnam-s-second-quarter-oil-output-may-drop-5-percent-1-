Vietnam  Oil & Gas Group’s second-
quarter crude oil production may fall 5 percent from the first
three months, the state company said.  Production, including overseas output, may drop to 3.5
million metric tons from 3.68 million in the first quarter, the
company known as PetroVietnam said in an emailed statement today.  Vietnam,  Southeast Asia ’s third-largest oil-producer, is
trying to boost crude output by developing new fields.
PetroVietnam expects to start production in July at the domestic
field of Chim Sao and at the Dana block SK305 in  Malaysia ,
according to the statement.  Second-quarter revenue may rise to 152 trillion dong ($7.3
billion) from 151 trillion dong in the first, PetroVietnam said.
Pretax profit may total 23.5 trillion dong in the April-to-June
period, the company said, without giving a comparable figure.  Natural gas output may fall to 2.17 billion cubic meters in
the second quarter from 2.3 billion cubic meters in the previous
three months, PetroVietnam said.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
