Finland ’s economy grew in January,
indicating the Nordic country’s expansion continued into 2011
helped by a recovery in exports.  Gross domestic product expanded an annual 6.1 percent in
the first month of the year, Helsinki-based  Statistics Finland 
said today, citing the trend indicator for the country’s output
data. The office revised the December growth rate down to 6.8
percent, versus a previous 7.2 percent estimate.  Finland, one of the euro area’s six AAA rated economies, is
benefiting from a resurgence in trade that’s buoying its labor
market and rekindling consumer demand. That’s fueling inflation,
which accelerated to 3.3 percent in February, the fastest pace
since December 2008.  The yield on Finland’s 10-year bond rose to 3.61 percent
today from 3.6 percent yesterday, according to data available on
Bloomberg. The Frankfurt-based  European Central Bank  will
probably raise its benchmark interest rate a quarter point to
1.25 percent at tomorrow’s meeting, according to all 57
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
