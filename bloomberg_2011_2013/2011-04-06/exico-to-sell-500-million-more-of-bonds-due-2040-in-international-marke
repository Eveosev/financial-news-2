Mexico  sold $1 billion of its 6.05
percent debt due in 2040 after doubling the initial size of the
offering.  The bonds priced to yield 5.95 percent, or 134.6 basis
points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, according to
people familiar with the offering. Bank of America Corp. and
Deutsche Bank AG arranged the sale, said the people, who
declined to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak publicly.  Mexico sold dollar debt for the second time this year after
the extra yield investors demand to own the country’s dollar
bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries declined 22 basis points, or
0.22 percentage point, from the end of last year. Mexico last
borrowed in dollars in February, when it issued $1 billion of
5.125 percent bonds due in January 2020.  “It gives them a chance to lengthen their maturity
profile, deepens the issue providing a real benchmark in that
part of the maturity spectrum, and we’ve had a concession in the
30-year Treasury,” said  Michael Roche , a New York-based
emerging-market strategist at MF Global Holdings Inc. “The
window has opened up for them.”  Mexico originally sold $1.5 billion of the 6.05 percent
securities due 2040 in 2008. The country sold $750 million in
2009 and an additional $1 billion in April of last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the dollar debt rose 8 basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 5.94 percent at 3:55 p.m. New York time.
The price fell 1.15 cent to 101.43 cents per dollar. Thirty-year
U.S. Treasuries yield 4.59 percent, down from a 10-month high of
4.7652 percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
