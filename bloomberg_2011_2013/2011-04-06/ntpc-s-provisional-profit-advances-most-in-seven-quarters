NTPC Ltd. (NATP) ,  Asia ’s biggest power
generator by value, posted the fastest profit growth in seven
quarters, according to provisional figures from the company.  Net income in the three months ended March 31 rose 24
percent to 25.1 billion rupees ($568 million), Indian state-
owned NTPC said in a statement in New Delhi today. The gain in
profit was the most since June 2009. Sales in the fourth quarter
climbed 18 percent to 144.9 billion rupees.  The state-owned utility plans to more than double
generation capacity to 75,000 megawatts by March 2017 to reduce
blackouts in Asia’s second-fastest growing major economy. The
government forecast Feb. 28 that the $1.3 trillion economy will
expand as much as 9.25 percent in the year that started April 1,
the most since 2008.  NTPC gained 2 percent to 191.80 rupees at close in Mumbai.
The stock has declined 8.6 percent in the past year compared
with a 9.3 percent increase in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  The power producer may need 162 million metric tons of coal
to fire generation plants in the year ending March 31, Chairman
Arup Roy Choudhury told reporters in  New Delhi  today. The
company may import 14 million tons of coal in this period, he
said.  NTPC plans to spend 264 billion rupees to add 4,320
megawatts of generation capacity in the current financial year,
according to the statement.  The provisional profit for the year ended March 31 rose 1.1
percent to 88.3 billion rupees, while sales grew 16 percent to
537.2 billion rupees, NTPC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
