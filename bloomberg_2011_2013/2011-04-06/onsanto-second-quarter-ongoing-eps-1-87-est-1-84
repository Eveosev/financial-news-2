Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s largest
seed company, boosted its forecast for free  cash flow  after
posting second-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ estimates
on higher sales of herbicide and genetically modified seeds.  Per-share earnings excluding discontinued operations were
$1.87 in the three months through Feb. 28, Monsanto said today
in a statement. That topped the $1.84 average estimate of 18
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The St. Louis-based company said free cash flow will be
$900 million to $1.1 billion in the current fiscal year, up from
an earlier prediction of $800 million to $900 million, because
of better working-capital management and “a strong economic
climate in agriculture.”  A “solid” sales season and Monsanto’s “disciplined
approach to spending have positioned the company to realize its
mid-teens earnings growth opportunity this year,” it said.  Chief Executive Officer  Hugh Grant  doubled gross profit
from agricultural chemicals after restructuring the unit last
year amid declining prices for Roundup, the world’s best-selling
herbicide. Profit from seeds and genetic licenses climbed 5.9
percent in the second quarter as corn and cotton prices gained,
boosting U.S. planted acres.  “Between the increased cash flow and the progress they are
making on cost controls, that’s a good sign,” Chris Shaw, a New
York-based analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. who rates the
shares “neutral,” said today in an interview.  Monsanto dropped $1, or 1.4 percent, to $72.60 as of 8.48
a.m. before the start of regular trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.  Earnings Forecast  Net income climbed 15 percent to $1.02 billion, or $1.88 a
share, in the three months ended Feb. 28, from $887 million, or
$1.60, a year earlier. Sales rose 6.1 percent to $4.13 billion,
trailing the $4.15 average analyst estimate in the Bloomberg
survey.  Profit in the crop chemicals unit was better than expected,
Shaw said.  “Seeds and traits were a little disappointing,” he said.  Profit excluding some items will rise to $2.72 to $2.82 per
share in the 2011 fiscal year, from $2.41 a year earlier,
Monsanto said, reiterating a forecast first made in October. The
average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $2.85.  Monsanto’s newest corn and soybean products were planted
last year on fewer acres than the company forecast and failed to
meet growers’ yield expectations in their debut. The company
responded by cutting prices for SmartStax corn seed, which was
developed with  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  to combat bugs and resist
herbicides, and Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans.  Market Share  The Pioneer unit of Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont took
35 percent of the U.S. corn-seed market in 2010, a 3 percentage-
point gain, to tie Monsanto, which lost 1 point, Don Carson, a
New York-based analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLC, said
this week in a report. DuPont gained 5 points in soybean seeds
for 31 percent of the market, while Monsanto fell 3 points to
25.5 percent, he said.  Monsanto’s share of the U.S. market should increase this
year to 37 percent in corn and 27 percent in soybeans, Carson
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
