AS Tallinna Kaubamaja,  Estonia ’s
biggest retailer, rose the most in more than seven months after
proposing a much higher dividend than a year earlier.  The stock jumped as much as 7.6 percent at the opening in
Tallinn, the biggest gain since Aug. 27. It traded 6.9 percent,
or 44 cents higher, at 6.89 euros at 10:45 a.m. Kaubamaja has
gained 8.7 percent this year, compared with an average 5.2
percent increase for its eastern European consumer services
peers, according to Bloomberg data.  Kaubamaja, which gets most of its revenue from Selver
supermarkets, proposed late yesterday a dividend of 28 euro
cents a share on its 2010 earnings, up from 4 cents a year ago.  The dividend “considerably exceeds our expectations” of 8
cents a share,’’ Pertti Rahnel, who heads equity research at
Swedbank AB in Tallinn, wrote in a note to investors today. The
proposed dividend “is definitely a positive for the stock,
widening the share’s appeal to different investor groups, and
the yield is also quite attractive,” he said.  The proposal, to be discussed at the annual meeting on
April 28, implies a dividend yield of 4.06 percent at the
current price, he said. Swedbank has a “reduce” recommendation
on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
