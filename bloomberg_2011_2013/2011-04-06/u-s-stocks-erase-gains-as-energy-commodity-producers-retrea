U.S. stocks erased an early rally as
energy companies slipped following an increase in oil
inventories and Monsanto Co. led commodity producers lower after
saying its fiscal fourth-quarter loss will widen.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,332.88 at 11:39 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as 0.5
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 17.14
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,411.04, wiping out most of a 57-
point advance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
