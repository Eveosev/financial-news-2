(Corrects amount of levy in story published April 5)  South Korea ’s National Assembly
passed a bill regarding a levy on banks’ foreign-currency
liabilities in a plenary session today. The South Korean
government proposed the levy late last year and may impose the
charge of as much as 0.5 percent of the banks’ foreign-currency
debt under normal circumstances and up to 1 percent during a
crisis to guard against sudden capital outflows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
