Federal prosecutors dismissed one of
four perjury counts against home run record holder  Barry Bonds ,
whose trial for allegedly lying when he told a grand jury he
never knowingly took steroids is under way in San Francisco.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nedrow informed U.S.
District Judge  Susan Illston  of the dismissal today. The count
said Bonds made a false statement when he said he didn’t take
“anything” other than vitamins given to him by his former
trainer before the 2003 baseball season.  Illston said yesterday that the charge could be construed
as meaning anything, including a “milkshake.”  The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
