Philippine three-year bonds rose the
most in more than two months after the nation reported a
smaller-than-targeted  budget deficit  for the first two months of
the year.  The shortfall was 8.1 billion pesos ($188 million),
compared with a ceiling of 52.3 billion pesos for the period,
the government said in an e-mailed statement in Manila yesterday.
The peso rose to an almost five-month high on speculation
overseas workers will send more money home ahead of this month’s
Easter holiday.  “There’s a bet on bonds,” said Marcelo Ayes, a Manila-
based senior vice president at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp.
“The budget news is positive. It’s the beginning of the
remittance season already.”  The yield on the 6.25 percent note due January 2014 slid
22.5 basis points, the most since Jan. 12, to 4.725 percent as
of 4:15 p.m. in  Manila . The rate was the lowest since Jan. 17,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  Finance Undersecretary Gil Beltran said yesterday the
deficit in the first quarter was likely below a 112 billion peso
ceiling. Remittances sent home by Philippine citizens account
for more than 10 percent of the $161 billion economy.  The peso appreciated 0.5 percent to close at 43.135 per
dollar, according to prices from inter-dealer broker Tullett
Prebon Plc. It touched 43.132, the strongest level since Nov. 9.
The currency has advanced 1.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
