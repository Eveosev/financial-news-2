Indian stocks fell the most in more
than two weeks after the central bank signaled it may increase
rates to control inflation at its meeting next month.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the third-biggest lender, dropped the most
in two weeks. The central bank’s “compulsions” to cool prices
are strong, Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said yesterday ahead of
the next monetary policy announcement on May 3.  Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the largest maker of sport-utility vehicles and
tractors, declined 1 percent, a second day of losses.  “The equity market chases growth and has inflation as a
dampener,” Kislay Kanth, head of research at Mape Securities
Pvt., said by telephone in Mumbai. “The central bank might
increase rates a bit more. This is not the best time to be
aggressive; the market is getting into a risk zone.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
105.78, or 0.5 percent, to 19,581.04, according to preliminary
closing prices 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The measure reached a three-
month high on April 4. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National
Stock Exchange dropped 0.4 percent to 5,889.65, and its April
futures settled at 5,912. The BSE 200 Index retreated 0.3
percent to 2,418.21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
