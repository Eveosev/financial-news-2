Iran  banned investors from trading
on foreign exchanges in a move the Central Bank said was aimed
at protecting Iranians from the risk of “fraud.”  “The activities of individuals or legal entities who
introduce themselves as being active in foreign exchanges and
encourage Iranians throughout the country to invest with the
claim of earning huge profits is illegal,” Iran’s Securities
and Exchange Organisation  said  on its news website. “There are
no legal foreign traders active in our country and no entity
holds a permit for activities in foreign exchanges.”  Iran, entangled in a conflict with Western countries over
its nuclear program, is under international sanctions which
restrict financial transactions with the country. This had led
Iranian private investors to seek the help of intermediaries for
trading on foreign exchanges.  Some companies and institutions seek to attract domestic
investors through setting up representations, Iran’s  Central
Bank  Governor Mahmoud Bahmani said in a report published today
by the state-run  Fars  news agency. “This sometimes leads to
fraud and considerable losses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
