(Corrects fourth paragraph of story published on April 6
to show adjusted operating ratio.)  CSX Corp. (CSX)  Chief Executive Officer
Michael Ward said the third-largest U.S. railroad will reduce
its expenses as a percentage of revenue this year and continue
that improvement in 2012.  CSX lowered costs last year as a recovering U.S. economy
and Asian demand for coal boosted volume, reducing its operating
ratio by 3.8 percentage points to 71.1 percent. The company has
forecast its operating ratio will fall to 65 percent by 2015.
Productivity improvements may save as much $140 million and the
ratio will drop to the “high 60s” this year, CSX has said.  The company’s plan is “that we’re going to continue to
grow and that we’re going to continue to invest,” Ward said
today in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in  New York .  The company’s operating ratio was 88.6 percent in 2003, the
year Ward was named CEO, after being adjusted for an accounting
change, according to CSX. Last year’s operating ratio was the
third-lowest of nine publicly traded North American railroads,
trailing only  Union Pacific Corp. (UNP) ’s 70.6 percent and Canadian
National Railway Co.’s 63.6 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  CSX, based in Jacksonville,  Florida , was unchanged at
$77.65 at 2:09 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares, which have climbed 20 percent this year,
gained 33 percent in 2010.  Through yesterday, the shares more than doubled since 2006,
compared with a 6 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index. Union Pacific, the largest publicly traded U.S. railroad,
also more than doubled, and  Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC)  climbed 37
percent.  ‘Powerful’ Improvement  CSX may reach its goal of a 65 percent or lower operating
ratio a year early, in part by boosting its pricing faster than
the rate of inflation,  Peter Nesvold , a New York-based analyst
with Jefferies & Co., said in a telephone interview.  “The rail story is about consistently getting 2 to 3
percent” increases in real rates, Nesvold said. “While it
seems modest, if you do that year-in, year-out, the compounding
effect leads to some powerful margin expansion.”  Railroads have benefited as higher oil prices widen their
fuel-saving advantage over trucking companies. Railroads can
move a ton of freight 156 miles to 512 miles on a gallon of
fuel, compared with 68 miles to 133 miles for truckers,
according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal
Railroad Administration.  Oil prices  from $80 to $120 a barrel boost diesel fuel
prices enough to make companies more likely to consider shipping
by rail instead of trucks, Ward said.  Oil ‘Drag’  Oil above $120 becomes a “drag on the economy and is bad
for everybody,” Ward said.  Crude oil for May delivery rose 39 cents to $108.73 a
barrel at 2:18 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
touched $109.15 today, the highest intraday price since Sept.
24, 2008.  Consumer spending  in the U.S. rose more than forecast in
February as incomes climbed, and the Institute for Supply
Management’s measure of the nation’s manufacturing expanded in
March at close to the fastest pace in almost seven years.  China ’s manufacturing growth accelerated for the first time
in four months, with the index rising to 53.4 in March from 52.2
in February, while  India ’s manufacturing grew for the 24th
straight month in March as the index remained at 57.9. Russia’s
factory output gauge increased to 55.6 last month, the highest
in almost five years, from 55.2 in February.  Union Pacific is the largest publicly traded U.S. railroad
by market capitalization and revenue. CSX trailed both Union
Pacific and  Warren Buffett ’s Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.
by 2010 revenue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
