     April 6 (Bloomberg) --The pound weakened against the euro
and erased its gain against the dollar after a report showed
industrial production unexpectedly declined in February. U.K.
gilts rose.  Sterling weakened by 0.6 percent to 87.77 pence per euro as
of 9:40 a.m. in  London . It was little changed at $1.6283 after
climbing to $1.6364, the strongest level since March 23.  Industrial output dropped 1.2 percent from January when it
increased by a revised 0.3 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said today in London. The median prediction of 28
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a gain of 0.4 percent.  The U.K. 10-year government bond yield dropped two basis
points to 3.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
