Pacific Fibre Ltd.  is inviting
tenders to build a fiber-optic cable linking  New Zealand ,
Australia and the U.S., and will fund the $350 million project
alone after a joint agreement expired earlier this year.  The invitation to tender was sent to “leaders in the
submarine cable system supply industry,” the Auckland-based
company said in a statement on its website today. The 8,100 mile
cable will be able to move 5.12 terabits of data a second, five-
times the capacity of the Southern Cross Cable Network part-
owned by Telecom Corp., Pacific Fibre said last year.  The lapsed partnership agreement was with Hong Kong-based
Pacnet Ltd., the National Business Review reported today,
without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
