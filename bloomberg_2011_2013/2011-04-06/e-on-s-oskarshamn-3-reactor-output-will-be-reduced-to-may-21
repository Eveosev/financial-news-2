E.ON AG (EOAN) , Germany’s biggest utility,
plans to run its 1,400-megawatt Oskarshamn-3 nuclear reactor in
southeast Sweden at reduced capacity through May 21.  “Due to a problem with a valve in turbine system the power
output will be about 950 megawatts plus or minus 100
megawatts,” the company said in a filing to the Nord Pool Spot
AS exchange late yesterday. The unit restarted on Apr. 3 after a
seven-day stoppage to deal with a problem with the valve.  The German utility owns 55 percent of the plant and  Fortum
Oyj (FUM1V)  of Finland the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
