Turkey ’s main pro-Kurdish party
warned ethnic Kurds in the southeast of the country to keep away
from Imams sent by the government to defeat Kurdish nationalism,
 Milliyet  reported.  The government has dispatched the Imams to the mainly-
Kurdish region for political reasons and Kurds “shouldn’t line
up behind them at prayer time,” said Nurettin Demirtas, head of
the main pro-Kurdish party in parliament, according to Milliyet.
The Imams belong to sects including a group run by Fethullah
Gulen, an Islamic preacher who resides in Pennsylvania, he said.  The Imams’ function is no different to the government’s
policy in the 1990’s of sending army intelligence units to deal
with Kurds seeking political autonomy, Milliyet cited Demirtas
as saying.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  accused Demirtas of
sabotaging prayer time and mixing separatism with religion, the
newspaper said.      Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
