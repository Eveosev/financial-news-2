Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
refiner, proposed using the income of its Croatian subsidiary
 INA  Industrija Nafte d.d for further investments to increase the
unit’s financial stability.  “By retaining profits, INA would be able to reinforce its
financial position by reducing indebtedness,” Mol spokesperson
Domokos Szollar said in an e-mailed statement today. “In
addition, owing to the situation on the Middle East, where
currently an elevated level of risks can be experienced, INA
needs to carefully analyze its cash generation which partially
depends on this region.”  Mol holds 47.26 percent of INA, while the Croatian
government owns 44.84 percent. Mol won the controlling rights of
 Croatia ’s leading refiner in a 2009 partnership agreement with
the government.  The Croatian company booked a net profit of 958 million
Croatian kuna ($186 million), which could be used in the
financing of investments in exploration and production
activities in the Adriatic Sea region and  Syria  as well as the
modernization of the company’s refineries, according to the
statement.  INA may hold its annual general meeting for the week
starting May 16, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
