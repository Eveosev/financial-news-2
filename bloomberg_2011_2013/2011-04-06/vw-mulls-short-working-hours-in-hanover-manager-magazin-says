Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Hanover operation is
experiencing a shortage of parts delivered from  Japan  and has
asked the German work agency about conditions for introducing
short working hours there, Manager Magazin reported today,
citing unidentified people from the industry. 
  Japan’s earthquake has not had an impact on Volkswagen’s
production so far, an unnamed company spokesman told the
magazine. French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen has cut production
by 20 percent to 60 percent due to a lack of air mass sensors
from Japan, Manager Magazin added.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
