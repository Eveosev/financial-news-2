Formula One champion Red Bull and
rival teams got a combined $658 million in prize money in 2010,
a 21 percent increase on the previous year.  The payments rose for a third straight year on improved
terms from the so-called Concorde Agreement that governs the
most-watched motor racing series, according to a filing by
Formula One Administration Ltd. at Companies House in  London .  Formula One had net income of $296 million for 2010 after
boosting sales by 2 percent to $1.08 billion by adding races in
 South Korea  and  Canada , the filing said.  After buying Formula One in 2005, CVC Capital Partners Ltd.
agreed to increase prize money to participants to head off a
breakaway series being planned by teams. The total payout to
teams in 2010 was 164 percent more than in 2007, the last year
of the previous accord, the statement said.  CVC’s loss from Formula One widened to $660 million last
year on financing costs from its acquisition of the series, its
Delta (3) U.K. Ltd. unit said in another  Companies House  filing.  Prosecutors are investigating the sale of a 48 percent
stake in Formula One to CVC by German bank  Bayerische
Landesbank , which received a government bailout following losses
on U.S. subprime mortgages. They are trying to find out whether
banker Gerhard Gribkowsky took a $50 million kickback for
engineering the sale. Gribkowsky’s lawyer, Reinhard Hoess, has
declined to comment. CVC said in a Jan. 5 statement it has no
knowledge or involvement in any such payment.  Separately, another filing at Companies House said the pay
of the top-earning executive in Formula One, whose chief
executive officer is 80-year-old  Bernie Ecclestone , rose 21
percent to 4.85 million pounds ($7.9 million) in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
