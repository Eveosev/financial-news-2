Minmetals Resources Ltd. (1208) , a unit of
China’s biggest metals trader, is seeking lenders to help
arrange a $5 billion loan to finance its acquisition of  Equinox
Minerals Ltd. (EQN) , according to a person familiar with the matter.  The company is in talks with Bank of China Ltd., China
Development Bank Corp. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China, the person said, asking not to be identified because the
details haven’t been finalized.  “It will be a consortium of Chinese banks,” said Martin
McFarlane, head of investor relations at Minmetals. “We haven’t
yet put out what the exact make up of that consortium is or what
the total amount is or the proportion amongst them,” he said.  Minmetals said April 4 it intends to make an all cash offer
to acquire Equinox for about C$6.3 billion ($6.5 billion).  -- Henry Sanderson . Editors: Hugh Chow, Ed Johnson  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
