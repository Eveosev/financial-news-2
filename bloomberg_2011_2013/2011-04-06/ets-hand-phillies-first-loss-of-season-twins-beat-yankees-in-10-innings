The  New York  Mets scored six third-
inning runs off Cole Hamels on their way to a 7-1 win against
the  Philadelphia Phillies . The  New York Yankees  gave up a 4-0
lead in a 5-4 loss to the  Minnesota Twins  in 10 innings.  David Wright  had a two-run single, Angel Pagan scored from
third base when Phillies catcher  Carlos Ruiz  let a pitch get by
him and  Ike Davis , Brad Emaus and Chris Young drove in a run
each in the third for the Mets (3-1) at Citizens Bank Park in
Philadelphia as the Phillies (3-1) fell to their first loss of
the Major League Baseball season.  Young, in his debut for New York, had two singles in the
third, making him the first Mets pitcher to have two hits in an
inning. He added another hit in his next at-bat to tie the club
record for the most hits in a game by a pitcher.  Philadelphiaâ€™s only run came in the fifth, when a Placido Polanco double to left field scored Wilson Valdez.  Young gave up five hits and a run while striking out seven
in 5 1/3 innings to get the win. Hamels took the loss after
allowing six runs on seven hits in 2 2/3 innings.  At Yankee Stadium,  Mark Teixeira  hit a three-run homer in
the first inning, his fourth home run of the season, to give the
Yankees (3-2) a 3-0 lead.  Andruw Jones homered in the second for New York and the
score remained 4-0 until the eighth inning, when the Twins tied
it. Joe Mauer walked with the bases loaded and Delmon Young
followed with a three-run double to make it 4-4.  The Twins (2-3) won it on a run-scoring single by Mauer two
innings later.  In other American League games, it was Texas 3, Seattle 2;
Toronto 7, Oakland 6 in 10 innings; Cleveland 3, Boston 1,
dropping the Red Sox to 0-4 this season; the Los Angeles Angels
5, Tampa Bay 3; and Kansas City 7, the Chicago White Sox 6 in 12
innings.  In the National League, it was St. Louis 3, Pittsburgh 2;
Colorado 3, the Los Angeles Dodgers 0; Florida 3, Washington 2
in 10 innings; Milwaukee 1, Atlanta 0; the Chicago Cubs 6,
Arizona 5; San Diego 3, San Francisco 1; and Cincinnati 8,
