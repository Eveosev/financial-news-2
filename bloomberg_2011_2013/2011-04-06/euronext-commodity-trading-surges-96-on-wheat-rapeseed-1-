Commodity trading on  NYSE Euronext (NYX) 
jumped 96 percent from a year earlier in March as buying and
selling of wheat, rapeseed and corn futures surged.  The exchange handled 2.33 million commodities contracts,
almost twice the 1.19 million traded in March 2010, according to 
monthly data  published by NYSE Liffe on its website today.  Milling-wheat futures traded in Paris on NYSE Liffe, the

second half of the month.  Average daily commodity volumes surged to 101,279 contracts
from 51,801 in March 2010, NYSE Liffe said.  Investors bought and sold 626,874 milling-wheat futures in
March, against 227,947 a year earlier. The value of wheat-
futures trading jumped to 6.76 billion euros ($9.7 billion) from
1.44 billion euros in March 2010. The grainâ€™s price averaged
about 235 euros a metric ton last month, up from about 122 euros
a year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Cocoa was the most valuable commodity traded on NYSE Liffe
last month, with futures worth 12.4 billion euros bought and
sold, up 63 percent from a year earlier. The number of contracts
traded increased 60 percent to 503,916.  Trading of NYSE Liffe corn futures more than tripled to
38,958 contracts in March from 12,138 a year earlier. The number
of rapeseed futures traded more than doubled to 218,758
contracts from 79,498.  Buying and selling of futures on white, or refined, sugar
