Diageo Plc (DGE)  offered to buy Meta Abo,
a state-owned Ethiopian brewery, as it seeks to expand in East
Africa, Business Daily reported, without citing anyone.  Any purchase may complicate plans by East Africa Breweries
Ltd., in which Diageo has a 50.03 percent stake, to enter the
Ethiopian market, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
