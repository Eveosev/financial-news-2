Danielle Adams scored 30 points to
lead  Texas A&M University  to its first national women’s college
basketball title.  Adams tallied 22 points in the second half as the Aggies
rallied from a two-point halftime deficit to beat the University
of  Notre Dame  76-70 in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association championship game.  “I knew they couldn’t stop me inside so that’s what I did,
I took it inside,” Adams said after the game at Conseco
Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.  Tyra White scored 18 and Sydney Colson added 10 for  Texas
A&M  (33-5), which eliminated Stanford to reach the title game.  Notre Dame  (31-8) trailed by as many as 12 points in the
first half before rallying to take a 35-33 halftime lead.  “We had a bad 10 minutes in the first half,” Aggies coach
Gary Blair said. “We found a way to come back and Danielle got
the ball inside.”  Notre Dame knocked out two-time defending champion
 Connecticut  to reach the final. It was the third women’s
championship in 17 years that didn’t feature Connecticut,
Tennessee or Duke, and the second title game without a top-
seeded team -- the first since 1994.  “We might not play the prettiest game in the world, but
it’s good for women’s basketball to see a Texas A&M and a Notre
Dame in this game,” Blair said.  Skylar Diggins led the Fighting Irish with 23 points,
followed by Devereaux Peters with 21 and Natalie Novosel with 14
points. Notre Dame has won the title once, in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
