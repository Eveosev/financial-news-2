Misys Plc (MSY) , a U.K. provider of
software for the financial industry, rose the most since
February in London trading after fiscal third-quarter sales
gains accelerated on new orders.  Sales climbed 7 percent to 85 million pounds ($139
million), the London-based company said in a statement on PR
Newswire today. Sales increased 2 percent in the fiscal first
half. Order intake gained 34 percent in the quarter ended Feb.
28, as Misys added banking, treasury and capital markets
business. The shares increased as much as 4.6 percent.  Last year Misys sold a majority stake in  Allscripts
Healthcare Solutions Inc. (MDRX)  to focus on financial-services
software. In February, it closed a deal to buy Sophis to expand
its operations in treasury and capital markets.  “Treasury and capital markets is as usual the star with
about 11 percent revenue growth, but banking has also grown
slightly,” wrote Roger Phillips, an analyst with Evolution
Securities who has a “neutral” recommendation on the shares.  He said third-quarter gains imply Misys is slightly ahead
of analysts’ expected 2 percent rise for the full year.  Misys advanced 9.1 pence, or 2.8 percent, to close at 335.1
pence at 4:30 p.m. in  London , after earlier gaining as much as
15 pence to 341 pence. The shares have lost 3.8 percent so far
this year, giving it a market value of 1.14 billion pounds.  Misys said it signed six customers to its new BankFusion
banking platform, giving it 19 for the year so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
