LG Chem Ltd. (051910) , South Korea’s biggest
chemicals maker, said it plans to spend 2 trillion won ($1.8
billion) by 2013 to expand its electric-car battery capacity.  The chemicals maker has finished building a plant in Ochang,
South Korea, that can supply  lithium-ion batteries  for 100,000
vehicles every year, LG Chem said in a regulatory  filing  today.
The plant is the world’s largest by capacity, the company said.  The shares rose to a record today as LG Chem said it aims
to get 2 trillion won in battery sales by 2013 and 4 trillion
won by 2015. The company has signed supply deals with carmakers
including Ford Motor Co., China-based Chongqing Changan
Automobile Co. and Renault SA, and aims to capture 25 percent of
the world’s electric-car battery market within four years.  “Its efforts are starting to bear fruit after General
Motors Corp. and other carmakers agreed to use its battery
technology,” said Hwang Kyu Won, an analyst at Tong Yang
Investment Bank in Seoul, who maintains a buy recommendation on
the stock. “Annual revenue from battery sales will increase,
with LG Chem maintaining an edge in the global battery market.”  The company is currently building a second plant in  South
Korea  and a third in the U.S., with operations slated to begin
in 2012. LG Chem said last year it may be able to supply
batteries for 350,000 vehicles annually by 2013.  The shares rose 1.9 percent to 477,500 won in Seoul trading,
compared with the 0.2 percent decline in the benchmark Kospi
Index. LG Chem advanced 91 percent in the past year.  General Motors Vice Chairman Stephen Girsky, who attended
the completion ceremony of the Ochang plant today, said the U.S.
carmaker plans to invest 4.8 trillion won in South Korea over
the next three years. He didn’t elaborate.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
