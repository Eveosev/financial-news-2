As many as 130 refugees are missing
after their boat broke up in rough seas off the coast of the
Italian island of Lampedusa, officials said.  About 200 people were reported aboard the boat that
departed  Libya  destined either for Italy or Malta, said Major
Ivan Consiglio, a spokesman for Malta’s armed forces. A distress
call by satellite phone was made by the migrants to Malta last
night, he said. The call was traced and coordinates for
assistance -- 39 miles (63 kilometers) off Lampedusa -- were
passed to the Italian Coast Guard.  When an Italian Coast Guard vessel reached the area, rough
seas had snapped the migrants’ boat in half, throwing all
passengers overboard. So far 47 people have been rescued and 15
bodies have been sighted, Commander Sandro Nicastro from Italy’s
Coast Guard Command Center, said in a phone interview. Italian
and Maltese ships are searching for survivors, Nicastro said.
Bad weather is hindering the rescue operation. “We fear many
dead,” he said.  About 2,000 Eritreans, Somalis and Sudanese have fled
Tripoli by boat to  Italy  and Malta in the last few days, the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
