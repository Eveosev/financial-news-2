Uruguay this year plans to swap part
of its foreign-currency bonds for debt denominated in pesos,
said Economy Minister Fernando Lorenzo.  The South American country will also sell peso securities
and use the proceeds to pay off bonds denominated in other
currencies, Lorenzo said without providing further details.  The South American country aims to reduce the amount of
debt that is denominated in foreign currencies to 55 percent of
the total from 65 percent at present, Lorenzo said.  “In 2011, we are going to achieve the conditions that will
enable Uruguay to deserve investment grade,” said Lorenzo. “We
are barely recognized by the rating agencies.”  Uruguay, a nation of 3.6 million, is rated Ba1, one level
below investment grade, with a stable outlook at Moody’s
Investors Service; BB+, one level below, with a stable outlook
at  Standard & Poor’s ; and BB, two levels below investment grade,
with a positive outlook by Fitch Ratings. The three companies
assigned investment-grade ratings to Uruguay in 1997 before
reducing them five years later after neighboring  Argentina 
defaulted on $95 billion of debt.  Uruguay’s peso rose 0.5 percent to 19 per dollar, the
highest in almost a year, as of 2:26 p.m. New York time. The
currency rose 4.7 percent this year, the third-best performer
among South American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The yield on Uruguay’s dollar bond due 2036 fell 2.8 basis
points to 6.073 percent. The bond’s price rose 0.4 cent to
119.81 cents on the dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The price of the government’s index-linked peso bond that
matures in 2037 rose 0.31 centavo to 100.93 centavos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
