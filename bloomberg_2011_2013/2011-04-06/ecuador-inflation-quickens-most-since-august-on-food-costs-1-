Ecuador ’s annual inflation rate rose
to the highest since August last month as increased costs of
global commodities pushed up prices for food, beverages and
clothing.  Consumer prices rose 3.57 percent in March from the same
month a year earlier and 0.34 percent from February, the
National Statistics and Census Institute reported today on its
website.  Prices in  South America ’s seventh-biggest economy are
rising as Middle East unrest and expected energy shortages in
 Japan  following an earthquake and tsunami lift the cost of
imported commodities, Hugo Jacome, an economist and professor at
Flacso University in Quito, said today.  “There is strong pressure on some products that Ecuador
imports that without a doubt will create tension on future
prices,” Jacome said in a phone interview. “This is already a
concern” that “may lead the government to adopt price
controls.”  Crude oil, Ecuador’s biggest export, rose 8.2 percent in
March to its highest since 2008 in New York trading and is
forecast to rise an additional 1.5 percent through year-end,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wheat is forecast to
rise 10.1 percent through the end of the year, data compiled by
Bloomberg data show.  Producer prices rose 4.56 percent in March from the
previous year and fell 0.79 percent from the prior month, the
agency said.  Inflation may quicken to 3.69 percent this year while the
economy is forecast to expand 5.06 percent, according to the
nation’s 2011 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
