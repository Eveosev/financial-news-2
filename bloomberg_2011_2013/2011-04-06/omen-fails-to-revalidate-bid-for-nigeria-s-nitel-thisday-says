Omen International Ltd., the second-
highest bidder for Nigerian Telecommunications Ltd., failed to
revalidate its offer for the state-owned company,  ThisDay 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Nigeria ’s privatization agency invited Omen International
to confirm its bid on March 14 after the New Generation Group
was unable to meet payments on its winning bid for the phone
company, the Lagos-based newspaper said.  Omen International had bid $956 million for Nitel, as the
company is known, in February 2010, behind New Generation
Group’s $2.5 billion offer, ThisDay reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
