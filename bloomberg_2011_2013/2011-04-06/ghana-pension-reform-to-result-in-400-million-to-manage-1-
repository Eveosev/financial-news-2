Ghana ’s equity and debt markets will
receive as much as $400 million annually beginning this year
through privately managed funds linked to a mandatory government
pension scheme, boosting efficiency and liquidity in the West
African nation’s capital markets, Renaissance Capital economist
Yvonne Mhango said.  About 25 percent of the funds will be invested in equities,
implying $1.9 million a week will enter the stock market, which
has a weekly turnover of $1.8 million now, Mhango said in an e-
mailed note to clients dated today. The bulk of the remaining
$300 million will go into cedi-denominated debt, she said.  “The entry of new institutional investors is therefore
expected to have a marked effect on the local equity market,”
Mhango said. “The new fund managers are also expected to make
markets more liquid, efficient and transparent, offer
alternative sources of financing from local commercial banks and
stimulate financial innovation.”  The change is part of a  2008 law  that created a  pension
plan  aimed at boosting savings in the world’s second-largest
cocoa producer. Under the law, employees in the so-called formal
sector will pay 13.5 percent of their earnings into a pool
managed by the government’s  Social Security and National
Insurance Trust . An additional 5 percent of earnings will be
automatically withheld and remitted to privately managed funds.  A third element of the law would create a privately managed
retirement fund funded through voluntary contributions targeted
at the more than 80 percent of Ghanaians who work in the
informal sector.  To contact the reporters on this story:
