RAB Capital Plc (RAB)  said investors will
pull about 79 percent of assets from its biggest hedge fund,
leaving the Special Situations Fund with less than $100 million.  The hedge fund will allow investors to withdraw money when
a three-year freeze on client redemptions ends on Oct. 1, the
London-based firm said in a statement today. The fund, run by
co-founder Philip Richards, had $2 billion at December 2007.  The fund slumped 73 percent in 2008, hurt by a bet on
Northern Rock Plc, the first British bank nationalized during
the credit crisis. RAB won investor approval to halt redemptions
in September 2008. The fund declined 7.6 percent in 2010.  “We made mistakes in the run-up to the crisis and that has
been a chastening experience,” Richards said. “To meet our
obligations, we have been managing the Special Situations
portfolio for liquidity at the expense of performance.”  RAB will keep the fund open and has changed its focus to
invest in natural-resource companies that are publicly traded,
according to the statement. Richards will continue to manage the
Special Situations fund. The firm’s total assets under
management have fallen 85 percent to $1.06 billion since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
