Canada ’s western and central
prairies had temperatures that were 1 degree to 5 degrees
Celsius below normal last week, while temperatures were
“slightly above normal” in Manitoba, the Canadian Wheat Board
said in a  statement  on its website.  As much as 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) of precipitation fell
in western growing areas, while central and eastern areas
received as much as to 1 centimeter, the board said. Cool, wet
weather limited snowmelt in some areas. Snow is mostly gone in
southern  Alberta  and the Red River Valley in Manitoba, the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
