Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe 
has “very little difficulties” with a decision by the Southern
African Development Community to send a team of officials to
 Zimbabwe  to ensure a power-sharing accord is fully implemented,
his spokesman said, denying a spat with the regional bloc.  “In terms of substance, the Livingstone communique
amounted to one huge step forward towards resolving problems in
Zimbabwe,” Mugabe’s spokesman, George Charamba, wrote in a
commentary published in the state-controlled Herald, referring
to SADC’s statement.  Jonathan Moyo, a lawmaker in Mugabe’s party, wrote in an
opinion article in the Sunday Mail on April 3 that SADC’s
decision opened a “treacherous window for regime change” in
Zimbabwe. The statement was “not worth the paper it is written
on,” he said.  South African President  Jacob Zuma  is the chief
facilitator appointed by SADC to oversee political and
constitutional changes in Zimbabwe before elections. A vote in
2008 failed to provide an outright presidential winner, leading
to a coalition between Mugabe’s  Zimbabwe African National Union-
Patriotic Front party  and the  Movement for Democratic Change ,
led by Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai .  To contact the reporter on this story:
