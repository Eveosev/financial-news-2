European Union authorities expect
Iceland to start the next stage of talks on becoming a member of
the 27-nation bloc in June, Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule
said.  “We expect actual negotiations to start towards the end of
the Hungarian Presidency with the opening of some chapters at
the Accession Conference scheduled for June 27,” Fule said in a
statement today after a plenary session of the European
Parliament in Strasbourg. “This is an ambitious but achievable
timetable with all sides committed to move forward.”  Iceland started EU entry talks in July, with no deadline
set for  membership . The initial “screening exercise is on
track” and “challenges in key chapters such as agriculture,
environment and fisheries” have been identified, Fule said in
the statement.  “As with any accession so far, we can expect that this
will not always be an easy task but we trust that we have
embarked with Iceland on a successful journey,” Fule said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
