Stocks may fall and Treasuries may
rally when the  Federal Reserve  concludes its $600 billion bond-
buying program in June, according to Hans Goetti at Finaport
Investment Intelligence.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that benchmark U.S. 10-year
yields, which move opposite to prices, climbed during the Fed’s
current round of bond purchases and when it scooped up
government debt in 2009. It also shows stocks advanced when the
central bank has been buying Treasuries, a policy known as
quantitative easing, or QE, that the central bank uses to spur
the economy.  The Fed purchased $300 billion of Treasuries from March
through October of 2009. It announced in November of last year
that it would buy another $600 billion of debt by this June, a
plan traders dubbed QE2. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke   wrote  Nov.
4 in the Washington Post that the benefits of the plan include
rising stock prices that will lead to increased spending.  “The idea was to raise asset prices, and the equity market
is up,” said Goetti, the Singapore-based chief investment
officer for  Asia  at Finaport, a Zurich-based money manager that
oversees the equivalent of $1.5 billion. “Once QEII expires,
the equity market might pull back. Where do people go? Into the
perceived safety of Treasuries.”  U.S. government securities handed investors a 3.7 percent
loss in 2009, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returned 26 percent, according to
figures compiled by Bloomberg.  Treasuries rebounded 5.9 percent in 2010 and the  S&P 500 ’s
gains shrank to 15 percent, while the Fed refrained from buying
until November. In 2011, Treasuries are down 0.3 percent and the
S&P 500 has climbed 6.5 percent.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
