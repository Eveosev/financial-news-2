The organizers of the 2016
Olympics in  Rio de Janeiro  said today they have surpassed a
“conservative” $700 million estimate for local sponsorships
with just two deals.  Rio, which was chosen by the  International Olympic
Committee  in October 2009 as the Games’ first South American
host, is now aiming to cap local sponsorships at $1.2 billion,
which means it won’t require government funds to run the event,
said Leonardo Gryner, chief executive officer of the Rio
organizing committee. The group won’t try to surpass that figure
because organizers aren’t motivated by profits, he said.  The 2016 Games have reached agreements with Banco Bradesco
SA,  Brazil ’s second-largest bank by market value, in a banking
category and with Embratel Participacoes SA and America Movil
SAB’s Claro, both owned by Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim , for
telecommunications. Gryner said both deals were for more than
$320 million and set records for local Olympic sponsorships,
without providing details.  “We would rather reduce the number of sponsors than
increase the overall revenue just to create profit,” Gryner
told reporters in London today. “The target we now have is not
to require any funds from the government. So we still need to
raise one-third of the target.”  The Rio Games will come two years after Brazil hosts
soccer’s  World Cup .  Brazil Economy  Brazil’s economy is among the world’s best performers with
its currency, the real, rising today to the strongest level
since 2008. Last month, the country’s central bank raised its
estimate for foreign investment for the year to $55 billion from
an earlier $45 million. The economy expanded by 7.5 percent last
year.  “We had a good competition in the market,” Grynero said.
“The Brazilian economy is booming so we have many companies
coming to bid.”  Rio has proposed investments of $11.1 billion in
preparation for the Games. Staging the event will inject $51.1
billion into Latin America’s largest economy through 2027 and
add 120,000 jobs annually through 2016, according to studies by
a Sao Paulo business school for the Sports Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
