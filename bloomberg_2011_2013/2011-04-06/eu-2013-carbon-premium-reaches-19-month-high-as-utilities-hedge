The premium of 2013 European Union
carbon permits over those for 2011 fell from a 19-month high.  The premium, traded as a separate contract, narrowed 4.3
percent to close at 2.21 euros ($3.17) a metric ton on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London. It earlier today widened to
2.36 euros, the most since Sept. 4, 2009.  The bloc’s power utilities need to buy carbon in  futures
markets  to hedge sales because EU regulators have not yet
started selling emission permits for the third phase of its cap-
and-trade program, which runs from 2013 through 2020.  While utilities seek to buy 2013 carbon to hedge forward
sales, there are few traders willing to sell it in the volumes
required, said Emmanuel Fages in Paris-based Orbeo, the carbon-
trading venture of Rhodia SA and Societe Generale SA. Power
generators wanting to hedge 2013 sales are “bumping into short
limits of intermediaries,” Fages said today by e-mail.  The volume of 2013 futures traded on ICE rose to a record
5.6 million tons on April 4 and the price fell 6 cents to 19.37
euros a ton today, still near its highest level for more than
two years. Futures for 2011 increased 4 cents to 17.16 euros.
German power for next year fell 15 cents to 59.85 euros a
megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  EU Considers Options  The EU said it’s considering options to bring forward sales
of carbon permits from a post-2012 reserve to spur clean-energy
projects.  The  European Investment Bank  is due before 2013 to sell 300
million CO2 allowances from the reserve for new installations in
the EU emissions-trading system and to disburse the revenue via
national governments to aid projects for renewable energy and
carbon capture and storage. The sales will also ensure early
supply of allowances from the next trading period of the EU
emissions program before it starts on Jan. 1, 2013.  The EIB said this week that it is “cooperating closely”
with the European Commission, the EU executive in Brussels, to
define when the  delivery  of the allowances could take place.
Sales are due to start within a month of the allowances being
made available to the EIB and can be carried out before an EU
registry to be created to track transactions and ownership of
permits in the so-called third phase is fully operational,
according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
