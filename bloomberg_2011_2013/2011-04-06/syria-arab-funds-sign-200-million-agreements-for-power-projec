The Syrian government signed loan
agreements worth more than $200 million with two Arab funds to
finance the construction of a power plant in the east of the
country.  The Saudi Fund for Development will provide 375 million
riyals ($100 million) at a 2 percent interest rate over 20
years, with a five-year grace period, Mohammad Al-Hussein,
 Syria ’s finance minister, said at a press conference in Damascus
today. The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development will
provide 30 million Kuwaiti dinars ($108 million) at a 3 percent
interest rate over 22 years, also waiving payments for the first
five years, Hussein said.  “This is the second time the AFESD is offering financing
for this project,” Hussein said. The fund offered an additional
30 million Kuwaiti dinars in October, he said. The  European
Investment Bank  also offered a loan to the project, Hussein
said, without disclosing the amount. The plant will be built by
 Metka SA (METTK)  and Ansaldo Energia SpA, a unit of Finmeccanica SpA of
 Italy .  “By securing these two loans, we will complete the
financing needed to build the power plant,” Hussein said.  The project, in the city of Deir Ez-zor, will cost 670
million euros ($954 million), Hisham Mashfej, Syria’s deputy
electricity minister, said on Feb. 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
