The  New York Mets  have received
interest from three parties who might be willing to acquire a
minority stake in the team according to terms the owners find
acceptable, the New York Post reported, citing unidentified
people close to the auction.  The three groups include one led by Steve Starker, co
founder of the trading company BTIG, and Ken Dichter, co-founder
of Marquis Jet. The two others are a group led by Anthony Scaramucci, general manager of SkyBridge Capital, and Goldman
Sachs Securities co-head David Heller with others.  The bids, if maintained, would permit  Fred Wilpon ,  Jeff
Wilpon  and Saul Katz to retain control of the team, the
newspaper said.  About six groups were pre-approved to bid on the team by
 Major League Baseball , the Post said. Bidders were skeptical of
the valuation and part of SportsNet New York may be offered to
compensate for the shortfall in the second round of the auction
due to conclude April 15, the newspaper said.  The owners have appraised the Mets at close to $1 billion,
while Forbes values the team at $747 million, the Post said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
