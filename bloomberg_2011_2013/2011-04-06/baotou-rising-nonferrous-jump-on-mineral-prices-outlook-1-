Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-
Earth Hi-Tech Co., a Chinese rare earths producer, jumped by the
maximum daily limit in  Shanghai  trading on the outlook for
prices of the metal used in radar and a range of electronics.  Inner Mongolia Baotou gained 10 percent to 97.26 yuan at
3:11 p.m. in Shanghai, the highest since the shares made their
debut in 1997. Rising Nonferrous Metals Share Co. advanced 5.8
percent to 77.93 yuan.  China  Securities Journal reported that concerns about
overexpansion of rare earth mining and environmental damage
signal an end to “cheap” rare earth supplies from China. The
paper quoted Yang Wanxi, a director of a rare earth “expert”
panel under the Baotou Municipal Committee, as saying a new
resource tax would add to price increases.  China controls more than 95 percent of the world’s supply
of rare earths, used in Blackberrys, hybrid cars and sonar
systems. The nation on March 31 extended by 12 months a ban on
exploring for the minerals and opening new mines, boosting
prices.  China has been curbing domestic output growth and exports
of rare earths and minor metals to conserve resources and
protect the environment, tightening global supplies and
prompting users such as  Japan  to seek alternative sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
