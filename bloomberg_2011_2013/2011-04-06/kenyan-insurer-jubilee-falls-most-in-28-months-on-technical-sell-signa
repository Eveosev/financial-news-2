Jubilee Holdings Ltd. (JBIC) , an insurer
with operations in five African countries, fell the most in more
than a year after its relative strength index, a technical
indicator, signaled the stock price is due to decline.  The stock tumbled 18 shillings, or 8.1 percent, to 203
shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, after its
14-day relative strength index was above the 70 mark on April 1
and April 4. A reading above 70 indicates the price may drop.  The shares gained 30 percent in the four days through April
5 after the company more than doubled its dividend as full-year
profit through December soared 84 percent.  Pretax profit increased to 2.53 billion shillings ($30
million) from 1.6 billion shillings, Chairman Nizar Juma said
April 1. The company declared a dividend of 5.5 shillings a
share and will issue a bonus share for every 10 already held, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
