Talwalkars Better Value Fitness Ltd. (TALW) 
plans to spend 1 billion rupees ($23 million) on expanding its
chain of gyms in India to tap an increase in spending on health
and well-being in the second-most populous nation.  The company, which opened its 100th  gym  on April 4, will
add 65 centers in the year to March 31, 2012, Chief Financial
Officer Anant Gawande told reporters in Mumbai today. The plan
includes opening 25 gyms targeting people in the middle-income
group in smaller towns and cities, he said.  Salaries in India may grow an average 12.9 percent this
year, the most in the Asia-Pacific region, compared with 11.7
percent in 2010, according to a survey by AON Hewitt LLC. The
nation’s economic growth may quicken to as much as 9.25 percent
in the year that began April 1, the fastest pace since 2008,
according to the finance ministry’s annual Economic Survey.  Talwalkars is “on track” to achieve revenue of 1.1
billion rupees and net income of 160 million to 180 million
rupees in the year ended March 31, Gawande said. The results are
due May 12, he said. The company has 200 million rupees in cash,
which will be used to fund the expansion, he said.  The company, which raised 774 million rupees selling 6.05
million shares at 128 rupees apiece in its initial offer in May
last year, aims to have 500 fitness centers in  India  by 2015,
Gawande said.  Talwalkars’ shares jumped 4.8 percent to 237.55 rupees at
the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the highest price since Jan. 25.
The shares have fallen 12 percent this year, compared with a 9
percent drop in the Bombay Stock Exchange Small-Cap Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
