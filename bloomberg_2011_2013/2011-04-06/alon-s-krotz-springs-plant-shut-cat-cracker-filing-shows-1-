Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  shut a fluid
catalytic cracker at its Krotz Springs refinery in Louisiana,
according to a  filing  with the National Response Center.  The cause is being investigated and workers are attempting
to “bring units back online,” according to the filing.  Joseph Israel, the chief operating officer at Alon, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail asking for additional
information before regular business hours in  New York .  U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  The refinery has a capacity of 83,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
