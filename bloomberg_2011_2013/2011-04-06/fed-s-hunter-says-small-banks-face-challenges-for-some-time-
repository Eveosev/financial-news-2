Community banks in the U.S. will
face a “challenging environment” for some time as depressed
commercial real estate weighs heavily on their holdings, a
Federal Reserve regulator told a congressional panel today.  “Although community banks have sharply reduced exposures
to commercial real estate lending -- sometimes through heavy
write-offs of problem loans -- many remain vulnerable to further
deterioration in real estate markets,” said Maryann Hunter, the
deputy director of the Fed’s division of banking supervision and
regulation, according to testimony prepared for a subcommittee
of the Senate Banking Committee.  The Fed is “consistently” being told by community banks,
defined as those banking organizations with $10 billion or less
in assets, that new regulations were a “key challenge and
concern,” she said.  The central bank regulates about 830 state member banks,
most of which are community banks, and 4,700 community bank-
holding companies with a total of more than $2 trillion in
assets, she said.  “Community banks will continue to face a challenging
environment for some time as they work through financial
difficulties brought on by the economic downturn and face
challenges that arise from a rapidly changing regulatory
environment,” Hunter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
