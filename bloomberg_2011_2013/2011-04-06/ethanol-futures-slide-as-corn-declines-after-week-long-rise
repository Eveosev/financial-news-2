Ethanol futures declined for a
second day in  Chicago  as corn dropped after a week of gains.  The grain-based gasoline additive slipped 0.7 percent while
corn fell for the first time since March 30, when the U.S.
Agriculture Department said farmers may boost acreage. Gasoline
futures fell after the Energy Department reported a drop in
inventories that was short of expectations.  “We’ve moved up so much in ethanol and corn in the last
week that people are waiting for things to stabilize before
taking in some gallons,” said Jim Damask, a manager at
BiofuelsConnect, a Heathrow, Florida-based alternative energy
broker.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery fell 1.9 cents to $2.70
a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have risen 79
percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  fell 0.5 cent
to $2.775 a gallon and in Chicago the additive lost 1.25 cents
to $2.68, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf and on the West Coast slipped 2
cents to $2.785 a gallon and $2.845, respectively.  Corn for May delivery fell 3.75 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
close at $7.63 a bushel. Prices for the grain, the main
ingredient in U.S.-made ethanol, have more than doubled in the
past year.  Gasoline for May delivery dropped 0.84 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $3.1929 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  U.S. ethanol production was little changed last week,
dropping 0.1 percent to 902,000 barrels a day, according to the
Energy Department. Stockpiles were also little changed, dipping
32,000 barrels to 20.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
