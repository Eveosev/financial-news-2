An increase in European Central Bank
interest rates, and a resulting stronger euro, are the “last
thing that  Greece , Ireland or Portugal needs,” according to
Pacific Investment Management Co.  “The ECB does need to make policy for the euro zone as a
whole, but perhaps it should consider combining a rate-hiking
cycle for the core with greater realism in terms of the approach
for the weakest peripheral countries,”  Andrew Balls , the
London-based head of European  portfolio management , said today
in a statement on the company’s  website .  “Perhaps the best thing that could happen would be
acknowledgment that Greece, Ireland and Portugal face
significant solvency challenges, and some or all of them will
need to restructure their sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed
debt,” Balls wrote. “Greece’s second review of its program
with the  International Monetary Fund  made clear that the program
is not working. It looks close to certain that Portugal will
have to call on the support of its European partners and the
IMF. The fact that its government fell last month has simply
delayed the inevitable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
