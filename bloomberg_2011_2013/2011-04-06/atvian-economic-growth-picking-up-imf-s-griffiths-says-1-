Latvian economic growth is “picking
up” after the world’s deepest recession and the country’s
outlook is “quite good,” the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The economy is “much stronger” and market interest rates
are coming down, the Washington-based lender’s Mission Chief
Mark Griffiths said in a press conference in Riga today. The
economy expanded 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter.  The government is meeting a mission from the IMF and the
European Commission today in an effort to unlock more of its 7.5
billion-euro ($10.7 billion) bailout loan. The Baltic nation
turned to a group led by the EU and the IMF for the loan after
its second-biggest bank failed in 2008.  “The outlook is really quite good,” Griffiths said,
noting the  budget deficit  must be trimmed to below 3 percent of
gross domestic product in 2012. “There is still adjustment
needed next year, but maybe less than we thought in the past.
It’s been hard work but finally results are showing.”  Latvia is seeking a budget gap of 2.9 percent of GDP next
year, the newspaper Diena reported today. The shortfall would
require additional budget measures of between 130 million lati
($261 million) and 150 million lati, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
