Portuguese two-year government notes
stayed higher after the nation sold more than 1 billion euros
($1.4 billion) of bills at an auction.  The yield on the two-year note slid four basis points to
9.10 percent as of 10:54 a.m. in  London , snapping a two-day
advance.  Portuguese government debt agency IGCP said it sold 455
million euros of bills due in March 2012 and 550 million euros
of bills due in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
