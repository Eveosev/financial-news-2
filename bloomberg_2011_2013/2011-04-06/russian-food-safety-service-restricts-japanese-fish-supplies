Russia ’s food-safety watchdog
restricted supplies of fish and marine products from 242 fish
processors in Japan, where an earthquake and tsunami damaged a
nuclear power plant last month.  The measure was applied “upon analysis of threats and
risks, which have appeared after the accident at the Fukushima-1
atomic power plant,” Rosselkhoznadzor, as the service is known,
said on its  website  today. Spokesman Alexei Alexeenko declined
to comment on the amount of seafood supplied to Russia by the
affected processors.  Fishermen in Ibaraki prefecture, Japan’s fifth-largest
seafood producer, halted operations today after tainted fish
were detected. Sergei Dankvert, head of Rosselkhoznadzor, said
Russia would ban fish deliveries from more than 200 Japanese
companies, news service Interfax reported April 1.  “This is a formal ban,” said Alexander Savelyev,
spokesman for Russia’s Federal Agency on Fisheries. “The
tsunami wave that destroyed 20 percent of  Japan ’s fishing fleet
and its infrastructure has practically destroyed these
enterprises. Whether there is a ban on deliveries or not, those
enterprises, which the ban relates to, are in fact destroyed
anyway.”  Russia imported about 59,000 metric tons of fish from Japan
last year, consisting mostly of saury, Savelyev said. Scomber
accounted for 500 tons and luxury fish products made up minor
amounts, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
