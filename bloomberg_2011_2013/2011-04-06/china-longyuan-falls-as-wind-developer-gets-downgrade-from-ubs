China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) 
fell the most in almost five months as the country’s largest
wind developer by market capitalization was downgraded to
“neutral” by  UBS AG. (UBSN)   The shares dropped 4.9 percent to HK$8.04 in Hong Kong, the
Beijing-based company’s biggest decline since Nov. 17, on a day
that the benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 0.6 percent. The stock
has risen 13 percent this year.  Radiation leaks from the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi power
station following Japan’s March 11 earthquake have prompted
countries to review nuclear plans and examine clean energy.  The effect of China’s nuclear plan is “marginal” on the
nation’s wind sector, which already has strong growth, UBS said
today in a research note. UBS has a target price of HK$9 on the
stock.  “Even if there was a change, it is impractical to replace
large-scale, baseload nuclear with small scale, intermittent
sources such as wind or solar,” the report said.  China  installed 17 gigawatts of new wind capacity in 2010,
two-thirds more than a year earlier, raising its total capacity
to 42.5 gigawatts, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance
data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
