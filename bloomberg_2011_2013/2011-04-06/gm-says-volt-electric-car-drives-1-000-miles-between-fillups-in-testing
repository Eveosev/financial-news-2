(Corrects spelling of executive’s name in ninth paragraph.)  General Motors Co. (GM) , the biggest U.S.
automaker, said drivers of its Volt electric cars were traveling
1,000 miles (1,610 kilometers) before they need to fill up,
enough to make the vehicles more practical for daily use.  GM’s $41,000 plug-in Volt runs on batteries. When the
charge dwindles, it switches to a gasoline-powered electric
generator for longer ranges. The Detroit-based manufacturer sold
1,210 units in the U.S. in the first quarter, according to
Autodata Corp. of  Woodcliff Lake ,  New Jersey .  “A sample of our early Volt customers suggest that they
drive 1,000 miles before they fill up the gas tank,” Tony Posawatz, vehicle line director for the Chevrolet Volt, said at
a conference in  New York  today.  The estimates suggest automakers’ dreams of selling viable
electric cars are getting closer to reality. President  Barack Obama ’s administration aims to have 1 million electric vehicles
on the road by 2015.  “Demand for the product is very, very high,” Posawatz
said. Consumers “can’t get enough of them.”  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has estimated the
Volt’s electric-only driving range at 35 miles. Drivers may go
another 344 miles on the gasoline generator, reaching a combined
range of 379 miles, GM said in November. Consumers who don’t
regularly drive very far can plug in the car to recharge and
won’t use much fuel.  Nissan’s Leaf  Nissan Motor Co. has sold more than 10,000 of its Leaf
electric vehicle globally, Andy Palmer, senior vice president at
the Yokohama, Japan-based company, said today at a panel
discussion with Posawatz.  The $32,780 Leaf uses only batteries and doesn’t have a
gas-powered generator. In fuel economy tests it traveled 73
miles on a fully charged battery, the EPA said in November. The
company has estimated the driving range at 62 miles to 138
miles, depending on conditions, before it must be plugged in to
recharge. The company has sold 452 Leafs in the U.S. this year,
according to Autodata.  Carlos Ghosn , chief executive officer of Yokohama, Japan-
based Nissan, has said that 95 percent of drivers travel fewer
than 100 miles a day, making the Leaf a practical fit for most
people.  Automakers plan to meet growing demand by introducing six
plug-in electric vehicles this year, either battery-only models
or those with back-up generators, and 14 more next year, said
Albert Cheung, lead analyst for energy smart technologies at
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
