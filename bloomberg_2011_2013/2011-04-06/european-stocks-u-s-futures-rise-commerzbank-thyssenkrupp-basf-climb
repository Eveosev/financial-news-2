European stocks advanced, rebounding
from earlier losses, after a report showing higher-than-forecast
German factory orders offset concern that increased interest
rates will dent profits. Asian shares were little changed and
U.S. index futures gained.  ThyssenKrupp AG and BASF SE gained at least 1.5 percent as
German factory orders rose in February at almost five times the
pace that economists had predicted. Commerzbank AG surged 4.3
percent as it detailed plans to repay government aid and said
operating profit is “above plan.” Intesa Sanpaolo SpA jumped 5
percent as  Italy ’s second-biggest bank also gave details of an
expected capital increase.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.4 percent to 281.95 at
11:51 a.m. in  London , a day after Federal Reserve minutes showed
U.S. policy makers are divided over whether to maintain their
record stimulus past June. The benchmark measure has increased
7.6 percent from this year’s low on March 16 as investors
speculated that the economic recovery will withstand  Japan ’s
worst earthquake on record and popular revolts in the Middle
East and north Africa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
