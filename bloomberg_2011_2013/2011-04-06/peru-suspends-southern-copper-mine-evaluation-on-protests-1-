Peru suspended a review of a $900
million  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO)  project after protests in the
southern Andes left one dead and 13 wounded yesterday.  The evaluation of an environmental study for the company’s
Tia Maria deposit was suspended for 180 days, the Energy & Mines
Ministry said today in a statement. Farmers have blocked roads
and battled police in the Arequipa region for two weeks, saying
the project will use water supplies needed for agriculture.  “This measure paralyzes the evaluation of the Tia Maria
environmental study in a bid to seek dialogue,” Deputy Mining
Minister Fernando Gala told Lima-based television station Canal
N. “These people must halt their protests before we can hold
talks.”  Peru, the world’s second-largest copper miner behind  Chile ,
saw output decline 2.3 percent to 1.25 million metric tons last
year as environmental protests delayed projects being developed
by companies including Southern,  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and Cia. De
Minas Buenaventura SA. Southern’s parent company, Grupo Mexico
SAB, will decide this month whether to shelve Tia Maria, Chief
Executive Officer Oscar Gonzalez Rocha said March 30.  Southern Copper fell 0.6 percent to $40.24 at 2:10 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has dropped
18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
