Poland ’s central bank posted net
income of 6.5 billion zloty ($2.3 billion) last year and will
transfer 95 percent of it to this year’s central government
budget, the bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  The budget had called for a payment of 1.7 billion zloty
from the Warsaw-based bank, the Rzeczpospolita newspaper said
earlier when it reported the figure.  The money gained by the government will be “only and
exclusively earmarked to reduce public debt and the deficit,”
PAP newswire cited Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski as saying
today. It will lower Poland’s borrowing needs by 4.5 billion
zloty this year, PAP reported, quoting Deputy Finance Minister
 Dominik Radziwill .  To contact the reporters on this story:
