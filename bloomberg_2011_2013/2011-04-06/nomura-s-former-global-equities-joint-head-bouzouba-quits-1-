Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ’s Rachid Bouzouba, former joint head of global equities, has quit the
bank less than a month after being replaced in that role by
Benoit Savoret.  In a telephone interview, Bouzouba said he resigned last
week and was “going to take his time” before deciding on what
he was going to do next. A Nomura spokeswoman confirmed his
departure. He is shown as “inactive” on the U.K.’s  Financial
Services Authority  register. Nomura said in March that Hong
Kong-based Bouzouba was looking at “alternative roles” at the
bank.  Nomura is overhauling its senior management in  Europe  two
and a half years after acquiring Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
European unit. Nomura’s investment-banking fees fell 24 percent
in the third quarter from a year earlier to 34 billion yen ($400
million). In Europe, the firm posted a 3.4 billion-yen pretax
loss.  Bouzouba became global co-head of equities in March 2010.
Last year, he helped Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed  Al
Nahyan  buy protection against a loss in value of his entire 6.3
percent stake in  Barclays Plc. (BARC)  A former co-head of European
equities at Lehman, he reported to Savoret when he was Lehman’s
chief operating officer in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
