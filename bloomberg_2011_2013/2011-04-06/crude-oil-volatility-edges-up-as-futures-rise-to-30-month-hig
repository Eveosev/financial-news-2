Oil options volatility edged up as
the underlying futures rose to a 30-month high as NATO escalated
its air campaign over  Libya , bolstering concern the conflict
will spread to other energy-exporting countries in the region.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.2 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up
from 27.9 percent yesterday.  Oil for May delivery gained 49 cents to $108.83 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since
Sept. 22, 2008. Prices are up 25 percent from a year ago.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
May $105 puts with 2,325 lots changing hands. They fell 16 cents
to 50 cents a barrel. May $100 puts, the next-most active
contract, slipped 2 cents to 10 cents a barrel with 2,100
contracts trading. One contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $125 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 7,019 lots changing hands. They slid 9 cents to
75 cents a barrel. The next most active option, June $130 calls,
