World oil markets are “adequately
supplied” and prices reflect concerns about unrest in some
producing countries and the disaster in  Japan , according to
United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Mohamed Al-Hamli.  “The surge in oil prices are a reflection of geopolitics
and natural disaster but not the fundamentals,” he said at an
oil conference in Paris. “They are in good shape.”  Oil traded near its highest price in 30 months for a second
day, pushed in part by political conflict in the Middle East and
North Africa, the world’s largest crude supply regions. Oil rose
to almost $150 a barrel in 2008.  “We have spare capacity. We can always supply to the
market,” Al-Hamli said. “The market should pay more attention
to real supply rather than imagined shortages.”  Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Hussain Al-Shahristani also
said that OPEC is meeting current demand for crude and “there
is no shortage” in the market.  Oil prices  are unlikely to rise to record 2008 levels
because markets are better regulated, he said at the same
conference. “Speculators will not be allowed” to push the
price as high, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
