The pound rose for a fourth day
against the dollar as a report showed U.K. home prices rebounded
in March, adding to signs the economy is recovering fast enough
for the Bank of England to raise  interest rates .  The pound is headed for its longest streak of gains against
its U.S. counterpart in two weeks.  House prices  increased 0.1
percent from February, when they dropped 0.9 percent, Lloyds
Banking Group Plc’s Halifax unit said today. U.K. shop prices
rose 2.4 percent last month from a year earlier, down from 2.7
percent, which was the fastest since November 2008, the  British
Retail Consortium  in London said in a report today.  The pound gained 0.4 percent to $1.6354 as of 8:17 a.m. in
London, after climbing earlier to $1.6358, the strongest level
since March 23. It hasn’t gained on four consecutive days since
the period through March 22. It traded at 87.37 pence per euro
from 87.27 pence yesterday.  Britain’s currency climbed yesterday after a report showed
service industries grew at the fastest pace in more than a year.
The  Bank of England ’s rate decision is scheduled tomorrow.  U.K. 10-year government bonds opened lower, pushing the
yield up by two basis points to 3.78 percent. The two-year yield
increased one basis point to 1.46 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
