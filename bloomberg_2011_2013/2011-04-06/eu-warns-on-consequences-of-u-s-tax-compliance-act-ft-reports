Algirdas Semeta, the European
Union’s tax commissioner, says the U.S. Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act, aimed at Americans who try to evade U.S. tax by
holding assets elsewhere, may hurt European financial services
companies, the Financial Times reported.  In a letter sent to U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner
yesterday by Semeta and by  Hungary , which holds the EU’s
rotating presidency, it’s argued that the European financial
services industry faces serious consequences in terms of
compliance costs and penalties, the newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The U.S. Act requires institutions to provide names and
account details of clients with at least $50,000 of assets to
the  Internal Revenue Service  and makes them subject to a 30
percent U.S. withholding tax unless they do so, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
