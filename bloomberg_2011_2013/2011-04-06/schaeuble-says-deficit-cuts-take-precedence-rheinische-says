German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the reduction of the government’s budget deficit
takes precedence over tax cuts, Rheinische Post  reported .  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government must create scope for
tax cuts first, a task that hasn’t been made any easier by the
decision to accelerate the phasing-out of nuclear reactors,
which will lead to shortfalls in nuclear-fuel-rod tax revenue,
Schaeuble said in an interview published in the Dusseldorf-based
newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
