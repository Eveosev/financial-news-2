Iran  plans to slash four and not
three zeros from the national currency, the rial,  Donya-e-
Eqtesad  reported, citing Central Bank Governor Mahmoud Bahmani.  The bank will present its proposal to the government in six
months, the Tehran-based newspaper said. If the cabinet and
Monetary and Credit Council approve the plan, the bank will
start withdrawing notes and printing new ones, Donya reported.  Iran’s Economic Affairs and Finance Minister Shamseddin
Hosseini said on April 2 that the government plans to remove
three zeros from the national currency this year.  The plan to redenominate the currency was requested by the
government in 2007 and delayed because of the need to ensure
 price stability  first, Hosseini said.  One dollar exchanges for about 10,400 rials. Iran’s
inflation accelerated to 12.4 percent in the 12 months through
the Iranian month of Esfand, which ended on March 20th, from
11.6 percent the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
