Bwin.party digital entertainment
Plc, the company formed by last month’s merger of Bwin
Interactive Entertainment AG and PartyGaming Plc, fell 16
percent in London trading after German states’ prime ministers
proposed a 16.67 percent tax on sports betting.  The drop was the most since the U.S. barred Internet-
gambling financial transactions in 2006, sending PartyGaming
tumbling.  Germany  plans to introduce a 16.67 percent levy on
sports bets when it opens its sports-gambling market to private
companies in 2012, the Saxony-Anhalt state government said on
its website, citing a meeting in Berlin today.  The newly merged company gets about 23 percent of its pro-
forma revenue from Germany, with half coming from sports,
according to David Jennings, an analyst with Dublin-based Davy.
Bwin and PartyGaming combined March 31 to enter European markets
as they regulate and tax online gambling.  “Clearly the proposals look a lot more severe and
restrictive than the operators and the market would have hoped
for,” said  Nick Batram , an analyst with Peel Hunt who has a
“buy” recommendation on the stock. “It would significantly
restrict the ability of bwin.party to make money in the German
market.”  Bwin.party fell 31.5 pence to 166.4 pence, giving the
company a market value of 1.4 billion pounds ($2.3 billion).  “There is still a long way to go, and we are confident in
the end Germany will comply with  European Union law  and
implement a commercially viable licensing regime,” said John Shepherd, a spokesman for bwin.party in a telephone call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
