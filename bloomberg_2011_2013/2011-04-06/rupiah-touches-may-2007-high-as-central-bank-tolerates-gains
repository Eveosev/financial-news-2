Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced to the
strongest level in almost four years on speculation the central
bank will tolerate gains to manage inflation. Benchmark bonds
declined.  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy rose
6.65 percent last month from a year earlier, after increasing
6.84 percent in February, according to official data released on
April 1.  Bank Indonesia  will allow the rupiah to strengthen to
reduce imported inflation, Perry Warjiyo, director of economic
research at the central bank, said on March 25.  “Recent statements from the central bank signal that they
are comfortable with letting the rupiah appreciate,” said  Gundy
Cahyadi , a Singapore-based economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp. “The slower inflation in March has also led to a sense of
euphoria in the market.”  The rupiah gained 0.1 percent to 8,652 per dollar as of
4:36 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency earlier reached 8,648, the strongest level since
May 2007. The rupiah has advanced 3.6 percent this year.  The Indonesian government sold all of the 7 trillion rupiah
($809 million) of debt it offered in an auction yesterday, the
 Finance Ministry ’s debt management office said. “Yesterday’s
bond auction was well-received,” Cahyadi said.  Offshore funds increased holdings of the  country’s bonds  to
212.4 trillion rupiah as of April 4, from 200.4 trillion rupiah
at the end of February, according to data from the finance
ministry.  Indonesia’s inflation may continue to ease because of the
current harvest season, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Hartadi
Sarwono said in Nusa Dua, Bali today.  Ten-year  government bonds  fell. Yields on the 8.25 percent
bond due July 2021 climbed two basis points to 7.82 percent,
according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
