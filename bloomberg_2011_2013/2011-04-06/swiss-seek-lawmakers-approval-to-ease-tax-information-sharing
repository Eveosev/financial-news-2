The Swiss government will ask
parliament to approve changes to nine double-taxation treaties
that would make it easier to share information on alleged tax
dodgers and avoid international criticism.  Under the  proposal , foreign authorities would no longer
have to give a taxpayer’s name and address to get information
about that person’s Swiss assets, provided “identification
occurs by other means,” the Federal Tax Administration said
today in an e-mailed statement from Bern. That would prevent
“formalistic and restrictive” requirements from blocking
effective cooperation against  tax evasion , it said.  Lawmakers approved the tax deals with Denmark, Finland,
France, the U.K., Qatar, Luxembourg,  Mexico , Norway and Austria
in June, and will now be asked to agree on an additional
“interpretation clause,” the administration said. Double-tax
accords still pending parliamentary approval will be changed in
talks with the countries involved.  “Even after the amendments described, administrative
assistance will be provided only in individual cases and upon
justified request,” the tax administration said. “Fishing
expeditions remain impermissible.”  The changes are needed to avoid the “risk of failure in
the peer-review process” of  Switzerland ’s tax transparency by a
 panel  of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
