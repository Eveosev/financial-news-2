The Hungarian government may acquire
the properties of financially pressed mortgage holders more than
90 days overdue on payment of their loans, the news portal  Index 
reported.  The purchases would be part of a plan to help distressed
borrowers and may not cover more than 10,000 properties that
will be transferred to local councils and used for social
housing, Index reported, citing Daniel Gyuris, head of OTP Bank
Nyrt.’s mortgage unit and board member of the Bank Association.  Debtors, whose payments are less than 90 days due, will be
offered an exchange-rate cap on foreign-currency mortgages,
Index reported. The ceiling may be set at 260 forint per euro
for euro-denominated loans, according to the newsportal. Gyuris
didn’t put a ceiling on the rate for Swiss-franc denominated
mortgages, Index reported.  Debtors more than 90 days overdue on payments who can repay
their mortgages would be offered a choice of restructuring their
loans or selling their properties, Index reported.  The government may offer interest rate subsidies and would
set quarterly quotas for forced home sales by region to prevent
falling house prices, Gyuris also told Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
