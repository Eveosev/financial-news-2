Ivory Coast ’s incumbent leader,
 Laurent Gbagbo , said he accepts his army’s request for a cease-
fire, though no political agreement has been reached in his
dispute with President-elect Alassane Ouattara.  “There’s no agreement on the political front,” Gbagbo
said in an interview conducted last night and broadcast today on
LCI, the Paris-based TV news channel. He reiterated that he
believed Ouattara didn’t win a disputed Nov. 28 election.  Gbagbo also said he may leave Ivory Coast “if my departure
brings peace to my country,” though it’s “far from proven”
that his leaving the West African nation would end conflict
there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
