Hungarian stocks extended gains,
sending the benchmark index to the highest level in 11 months,
after factory orders in  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, rose
almost five times as much as economists forecast in February.  The BUX index jumped 1.8 percent at 12:32 p.m. in Budapest,
after climbing as much as 1.9 percent to 24,029.62, the highest
intraday trading level since May 4. OTP Bank Nyrt., the
country’s largest lender, rose 2.5 percent to 6,100 forint.  German orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation,
gained 2.4 percent from January, when they jumped 3.1 percent,
the Economy Ministry in Berlin said in a statement today.
Economists had forecast a 0.5 percent increase for February,
according to the median of 33 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
