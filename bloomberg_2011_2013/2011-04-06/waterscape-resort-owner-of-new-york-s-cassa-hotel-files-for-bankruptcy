Waterscape Resort LLC, owner of the
45-story  Cassa Hotel and Residences  in Midtown  Manhattan , sought
bankruptcy court protection after defaulting on loan payments.  The company listed more than $100 million each in assets
and debt in Chapter 11 papers filed yesterday in  New York .
Waterscape is behind on payments for some of $134.4 million in
loans.  “Unfortunately, the debtor has for several months been
embroiled in litigation with numerous contractors and
subcontractors” alleging $20 million in claims on the property,
Ezak Assa, executive vice president of Waterscape, said in court
papers.  He said one lender affiliated with U.S. Bancorp filed a
foreclosure action last month, precipitating the bankruptcy and
leading to efforts at selling the property, subject to a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court judge’s approval.  The new Casa complex on West 45th Street, completed in
2010, includes 165 hotel rooms, 57 residences and a restaurant
that hasn’t opened, according to Assa’s statement. He said that
as of November, the hotel property was assessed at $128 million
in market value, and the condominium segment at a sellout value
of $86 million.  The case is In re Waterscape Resort LLC, 11-bk-11593,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  Editors: Glenn Holdcraft,  Charles Carter   To contact the reporter on this story:
