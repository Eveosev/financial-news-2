Asia naphtha climbed for a sixth
day, the longest rising streak in half a year. Royal Dutch Shell
Plc and Chevron Corp. bought  fuel-oil  cargoes in Singapore, the
region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  rose 0.5
percent to $1,022.50 a metric ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prices advanced for a sixth day, the longest rising
streak since the 10 days to Oct. 7. The premium of Japan-
delivered naphtha to Brent, or the crack spread, fell to $97.78
a ton from $110.26 at the end of Asian trading yesterday.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline climbed 1 percent to $126.05 a
barrel, also gaining for the sixth day, Bloomberg data showed.
Gasoline’s premium to naphtha rose 70 cents to $14.20 a barrel.
This reforming margin doubled in the previous quarter, signaling
that the profit from making gasoline over naphtha is increasing.  In  Singapore , Glencore International AG sold 25,000 tons of
naphtha for first-half June delivery to Cargill Inc. at $1,024 a
ton, traders said. Shell sold a similar naphtha cargo to Itochu
Corp. at $1,024 a ton.  Glencore also sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline
loading April 23 to April 27 to Trafigura Beheer BV at $126 a
barrel, traders said. The world’s biggest commodities trader
sold 50,000 barrels of the same grade loading April 21 to April
25 to Morgan Stanley at $125.90 a barrel. Glencore also sold
50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline loading April 23 to April 27
to Trafigura at $128.20 a barrel.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil rose $3, or 0.4 percent,
to $688.50 a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The price of 380-
centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, climbed $5, or
0.7 percent, to $678.50. Each variety increased for a sixth day,
the longest rally since January.  In Singapore, Shell bought a 380-centistoke fuel oil cargo
for a second day, paying $5 a ton over benchmark quotes to
Cargill Inc. for 20,000 tons, traders said. That’s the same
premium as in yesterday’s transaction. Chevron Corp. bought
40,000 tons from Kuo Oil Ltd. at $678 a ton.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened for a second day
to $8.16 a barrel, signaling continued losses from turning oil
into residual products, Bloomberg data showed. The premium of
180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade, or the
viscosity spread, narrowed to $10 a ton, meaning bunker gained
more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur rose $1.35, or 1
percent, to $138.50 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data.  Jet
fuel  climbed $1, or 0.7 percent, to $138.45. Each product
increased for a sixth day to the highest since August 2008.  In Singapore, the premium paid for 0.5 percent sulfur
gasoil rose to 60 cents a barrel from 40 cents yesterday, after
BP Plc sold 150,000 barrels to Cargill, traders said. Vitol
bought 230,000 barrels at the same price from Total SA and paid
plus 50 cents to BP for 150,000 barrels.  Total sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10 parts-per-
million of sulfur to BP at a premium of $4.10 a barrel, traders
said. Glencore sold a similar cargo to Shell at a $4 premium.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude fell 46
cents to $22.15 a barrel at 6:10 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure of
refining profit, declined for a second day.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising
yesterday to 65 cents a barrel, PVM said. This regrade has
slumped 35 percent so far in April, indicating it’s less
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Vitol sold jet fuel in Singapore for a fourth day,
receiving 30 cents a barrel over quotes from Hin Leong,
according to traders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
