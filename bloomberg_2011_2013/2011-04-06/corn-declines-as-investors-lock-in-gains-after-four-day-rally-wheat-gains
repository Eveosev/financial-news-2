Wheat gained after the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said  crop conditions  in the country,
the biggest exporter of the grain, declined to the lowest
ratings since 2002.  About 37 percent of the U.S. crop was good or excellent,
down from 65 percent a year earlier, the USDA said in a report
on April 4, the first this year measuring conditions in all
growing states. The reading was the lowest since 2002, when 31
percent got the top ratings.  “The strength in wheat is likely attributable to concerns
about the U.S.” southern Plains, said Justine White, an analyst
at VM Group in  London . “The USDA has downgraded the crop
ratings for critical growing regions following persistent dry
conditions and there are fears of production losses if
conditions do not improve in the near future.”  Wheat for July delivery, the contract with the largest open
interest, gained 1.75 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $8.245 a bushel
by 8:04 a.m. in  Chicago . May-delivery wheat, which has the most
volume, also rose 1.75 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $7.88 a bushel.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris, which has the most volume and open interest, fell 50 euro
cents, or 0.2 percent, to 219.25 euros ($313.40) a metric ton.
Prices surged in the past year on demand for varieties of the
grain to make bread and pasta.  Corn was little changed in Chicago on speculation some
investors are cashing in gains after a rally to a 33-month high.
Futures added 16 percent in four sessions through yesterday
after the USDA said domestic stockpiles on March 1 fell to 6.52
billion bushels, the lowest for the date since 2007, in its
quarterly stockpiles report last week.  ‘Think Twice’  “I would expect any weakness in the corn market to be
short-lived considering the tight supply outlook,” VM Group’s
White said. “Perhaps we reached levels which made buyers think
twice, but they are not likely to stay on the sidelines for
long. Prices may have dipped but the actual price floor seems to
be getting higher, which is a sign of ongoing strength.”  Corn for May delivery fell 0.5 cent to $7.6625 a bushel in
Chicago. The price has more than doubled in the past year on
declining stockpiles and increased demand for the grain.  Soybeans for May delivery increased for the first time in
four sessions in Chicago, adding 10 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$13.8325 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
