Brazil â€™s central bank may
continue to raise its benchmark interest rate after its
April 19-20 policy meeting,  Valor Economico  newspaper said,
without saying where it obtained the information.  Policy makers will raise rates as much as necessary to
bring inflation within target in 2012, the Sao-Paulo-based
newspaper said.  The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent,
plus or minus two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
