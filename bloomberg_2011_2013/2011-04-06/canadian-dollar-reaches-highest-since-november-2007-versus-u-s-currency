Canada ’s dollar rose to the
strongest level in more than three years against its U.S.
counterpart as global equities gained amid speculation about
faster economic growth and inflation.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, appreciated for
the seventh time in the past eight days on increased demand for
higher-yielding currencies. Gold reached the highest level on
record as rising inflation spurred demand and oil exceeded $109
a barrel. The greenback weakened against most of its peers as
the  European Central Bank  is forecast to increase its benchmark
interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent tomorrow.  “It’s generally a risk-on story,” said  John Curran , a
senior vice president in Toronto at CanadianForex Ltd., an
online foreign-exchange dealer. “This is a general  U.S. dollar 
weakening move, which was preceded by yesterday’s  Federal Open
Market Committee  minutes and Canada is riding the wave.”  The Canadian currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 96.08
cents per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 96.38 cents
yesterday. It touched 95.69 cents, the strongest since November
2007. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0410.  The loonie reached the strongest level since it was first
allowed to float in 1950, 90.58 cents, on Nov. 7, 2007, as the
collapse of the U.S. subprime-mortgage market disrupted
financial markets and weakened the greenback.  Gold Glitters  Gold for June delivery rose 1.1 percent to $1,463.30 an
ounce in New York after touching a record $1,466.20 an ounce.
The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of  raw materials  gained
for the fifth consecutive day, increasing 0.1 percent.  Crude oil for May delivery gained 0.3 percent to $108.66 a
barrel in New York. It touched $109.15 earlier, the highest
since September 24, 2008.  Raw materials, including oil and gold, account for about
half of Canada’s export revenue.  The MSCI World Index increased 0.4 percent, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2 percent.  The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against six of its major trading partners
including the Canadian dollar, fell for the second day,
declining 0.5 percent.  Two Dollars  “Canadian dollar strength is more a function of a weak
U.S. dollar,” said  Shane Enright , executive director in Toronto
at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World Markets unit.
“It’s also an interest-rate differential story, which puts more
pressure on the dollar.”  Canada’s currency fell 0.5 percent to C$1.3770 versus the
euro as ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled on March 3
that policy makers may raise the benchmark interest rate at
tomorrow’s meeting to curb consumer-price inflation, which
reached a two-year high of 2.6 percent in March.  Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart 
said he doesn’t expect the central bank to raise  interest rates 
by the end of the year with inflation low and the economic
recovery fragile. He spoke today during an Atlanta Fed
Conference at Stone Mountain,  Georgia .  Fed policy makers last month differed about whether to
begin removing record stimulus this year as they debated the
path of monetary policy after the completion of their $600
billion debt-purchase program, according to the minutes of the
March 15 meeting. The U.S. central bank, which meets April 27,
has kept its key U.S. interest rate at zero to 0.25 percent
since 2008.  ‘Apply Risk’  “It’s a green light to apply risk again and it’s impacting
the growth-sensitive currencies like the Canadian dollar,” said
 Dean Popplewell , an analyst in Toronto at the online currency-
trading firm Oanda Corp. “Fundamentals are very positive for
the Canadian dollar.”  The loonie fell 0.2 percent during the past month in the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a measure of
the 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro gained 1.2 percent,
while the greenback lost 1.6 percent.  The  Bank of Canada , which meets April 12, has kept its
benchmark at 1 percent since September after raising it three
times last year. Policy makers reiterated on March 1 that
“considerable slack” remains in the economy. Exporters face
“considerable challenges” from a  currency trading  near a
three-year high, they said.  Tight Money  “The appreciation of the Canadian dollar is another form
of monetary tightening,” Popplewell said. “The Bank of Canada,
like any other central bank, understands and is wary of
inflationary pressure.”  Government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the two-year
Treasury note up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
1.88 percent. The price of the 1.75 percent security maturing in
March 2013 fell 3 cents C$99.76. The yield on the benchmark 10-
year note rose four basis points to 3.41 percent.  Canada sold C$3.5 billion of two-year notes at an average
yield 2.042 percent, according to the Bank of Canada’s website.
The 2 percent securities, which mature in August 2013, attracted
bids of C$9.16 billion, 2.6 times the amount offered.  The country’s Ivey purchasing managers’ index was 73.2 in
March on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to a statement
on the University of Western Ontario business school’s website.
Readings of more than 50 indicate purchasing by governments and
companies advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
