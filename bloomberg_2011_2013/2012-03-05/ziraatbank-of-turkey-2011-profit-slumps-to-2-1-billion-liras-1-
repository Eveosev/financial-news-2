TC Ziraat Bankasi AS,  Turkey â€™s
second-biggest bank by assets, said full-year profit almost
halved as interest expenses surged.  Net income at Ankara-based Ziraat, wholly owned by the
government and included in a program of asset sales, fell 
43 percent last year to 2.1 billion liras ($1.2 billion), it 
said in a filing with the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.  Interest costs jumped 20 percent to 8.47 billion liras,
outpacing an 11 percent increase in revenue from interest, as
interest paid in money market operations more than doubled, the
earnings statement showed.  Commissions and charges revenue rose 23 percent last year
to 625.6 million liras, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
