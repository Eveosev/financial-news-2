New York Knicks season-ticket prices
for 2012-13 will be 4.9 percent more expensive on average as
parent company  Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG)  embarks on the second
phase of a three-part arena transformation.  Season tickets for the  National Hockey League ’s  New York
Rangers , also owned by the company, will rise an average of 9.5
percent, the teams said yesterday in a statement.  “Our top priority continues to be creating a world-class
experience for every person that visits the Garden,” Scott O’Neil, president of MSG Sports, said in the statement.  Knicks season-ticket prices rose an average of 49 percent
this season. Rangers season tickets increased by an average of
23 percent.  Season tickets will be offered in 23 price categories for
the Rangers and 22 for the Knicks, whose ratings and merchandise
sales have soared since Harvard University-educated Jeremy Lin
took over as point guard a month ago.  The Knicks are 18-19, third in the  National Basketball
Association ’s five-team Atlantic Division, while the Rangers
have a league-best 91 points.  The second phase of construction will focus on the upper
bowl of the arena, where the incline will increase 17 degrees,
moving fans seven to 10 feet closer to the playing surface, MSG
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
