Lafarge Cement Wapco Nigeria Plc (WAPCO) ,
the country’s second-biggest producer of the building material
by market value, gained the most in six weeks on speculation it
will pay a higher dividend.  The stock advanced 2.9 percent to close at 41 naira, the
biggest daily gain since Jan. 20.  “Investors are expecting a higher dividend from the
company for 2011,” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of
Kundila Finance, a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone today.
Lafarge Wapco paid a dividend of 25 kobo per share for the prior
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that amount
was constrained because of investment in an expansion project,
“this year, it has no excuse to not pay a higher dividend
having completed the project,” he said.  Lafarge Wapco took 45 billion naira ($285 million) in loans
to expand its plant in Ewekoro, in western  Nigeria . The new
 production line , which began production last September, is
expected to double the company’s output to more than 4.5 million
metric tons a year.  Wapco is a unit of  Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest cement
maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
