Platinum and palladium prices may
jump this year as a rebound in U.S. automobile sales boosts
demand for the metals used in catalytic converters, said James Steel, the chief commodities analyst at HSBC Securities USA Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows auto sales rose in five of the
past six months and are running at the highest annual rate in
four years. Platinum prices that are up 21 percent this year may
advance 15 percent further to $1,950 an ounce, the highest since
July 2008, Steel said. Palladium may reach $900 an ounce, up 26
percent from March 2 and the highest since 2001, he said.  Light-vehicles sales last month reached a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 15 million, the highest since February
2008, Autodata Corp. said March 1. General Motors Co., Chrysler
Group LLC, Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. topped
analysts’ estimates as  consumer confidence  rose and the
 unemployment rate  fell. Autocatalysts that use platinum or
palladium are fitted to 95 percent of new cars.  “An improving U.S. economy will help platinum and
palladium prices gain as we expect higher demand from the auto
industry,” Steel said in a telephone interview in  New York .  Russia, the world’s biggest palladium producer, may reduce
sales from state stockpiles by 80 percent to 150,000 ounces, the
smallest in at least eight years,  Barclays Capital  estimated in
a Jan. 17 report. Global demand will exceed supplies from mine
output and recycled scrap by 275,000 ounces in 2012, reducing
inventories, Barclays said. The market will be in deficit until
at least 2015, Credit Suisse Group AG says.  The  Federal Reserve  said on Feb. 29 that the  U.S. economy 
expanded at a “modest to moderate pace” in January and early
February, bolstered by manufacturing. Auto sales have rebounded
since the annual-average rate reached a 27-year low of 9.34
million in February 2009, according to Autodata.  To contact the reporter on this story:
