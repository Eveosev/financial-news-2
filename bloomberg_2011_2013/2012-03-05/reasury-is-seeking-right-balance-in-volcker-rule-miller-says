U.S. regulators are committed to
finding a balance in the Volcker rule ban on proprietary trading
that will keep financial markets safe while allowing market-
making activities, U.S. Treasury official  Mary Miller  said.  The Treasury is “committed to achieving the right balance
in the final rule,” Miller, the Treasury’s assistant secretary
for financial markets, said in a speech in Washington today to
the Institute of International Bankers.  Miller, who has been nominated by President  Barack Obama  to
become the Treasury’s undersecretary for domestic finance, said
she appreciates “the role of market-making” and knows the
“importance of deep, liquid markets. It is essential to have
buyers who are willing to step up and buy a position,
particularly during times of market stress.”  The Volcker rule, named for its original champion, former
Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker , is intended to reduce the
chance that banks will make risky investments with their own
capital that put their deposits at risk. The provision is part
of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.  The financial industry opposes parts of Dodd-Frank,
including the Volcker rule. The proposed regulation drew 17,000
letters, the most of any Dodd-Frank provision, during a comment
period that ended last month.  Dodd-Frank was enacted by Congress and signed into law by
Obama to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis that followed
the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
