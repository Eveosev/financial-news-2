Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW) , the online
recruiting service, hired Stone Key Partners LLC and Bank of
America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch to help it review strategic
alternatives.  Monster shares jumped 8.4 percent to $8.15 in extended
trading following the company’s statement. They had risen 1.6
percent to $7.52 at the close in  New York . At a conference on
March 1, Chief Executive Officer Salvatore Iannuzzi said he is
weighing options to boost investor value.  Iannuzzi has already said he will cut costs at Monster to
cope with the slow economic recovery and competition from sites
such as  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD)  that offer businesses less expensive ways
to recruit employees. The New York-based company said earlier
this year that it would eliminate about 400 jobs, or 7 percent
of its workforce, after the European economic crisis led users
to visit the job-search website less.  Whether Monster was serious about seeking alternatives
“was an open question in some people’s mind,” Tobey Sommer, an
analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. in Nashville,
 Tennessee , said in a telephone interview. “Now that they’ve
hired bankers, that solves it.”  Sommer said that if the company is acquired, a takeover
could generate as much as $100 million in cost savings, mostly
from general and administrative, corporate and marketing
expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
