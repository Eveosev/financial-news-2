Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s largest
drugmaker, sued a unit of Johnson & Johnson, contending it
infringes a U.S. patent for pain-relieving heat-patch
technology.  Pfizer, based in New York, is seeking unspecified damages
after a jury trial and a halt to sales of Fort Washington,
Pennsylvania-based McNeil-PPC’s  Precise-brand  patch, according
to a complaint filed in federal court in Delaware today.  “McNeil was aware of the patent” because its number “is
clearly marked on the packaging of  Thermacare , Pfizer’s
competing heat-wrap product,” Pfizer lawyers allege.  Pfizer, with $67.4 billion in sales last year, also makes
Lipitor for cholesterol control. Last month, Pfizer and  Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY)  were sued in an antitrust case in New York
alleging the drugmakers engaged in an anti-competitive scheme to
delay generic Lipitor into the market.  Seema Kumar, a  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  spokeswoman, couldn’t
immediately comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Pfizer v. McNeil-PPC, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 5,918,590.  To contact the reporter on this story:
