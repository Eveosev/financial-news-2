Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark stock index
retreated for the first time in 12 days amid speculation a rally
spurred by improved earnings at the emirate’s companies and
infrastructure spending plans was overdone.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) , the  United Arab Emirates ’
third-biggest bank, dropped 1.5 percent.  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) ,
which is controlled by Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, fell the most
in seven weeks. The  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  decreased 0.6 percent, the
first decline since Feb. 16 and the most since Jan. 17, to
2,625.42 at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The measure
advanced 6.7 percent in the eleven days through yesterday.
Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  was little changed.  “We expected there to be some profit-taking after such a
strong rally,” said Ziad Dabbas, a financial analyst at
 National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , the U.A.E.’s second-biggest
bank by assets. “We have mainly seen speculators in the market
and we do need to see some long-term investors come in, that may
happen gradually.”  Abu Dhabi’s shares have advanced since the government said
in January it plans to resume real-estate projects after
reviewing their viability and as corporate earnings improved.
The emirate’s gauge is up 9.3 percent this year, compared with
an 8.2 percent gain in the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of Persian
Gulf stocks.  Abu Dhabi Commercial, which rallied 2.8 percent yesterday,
fell the most since Jan. 30 to 3.27 dirhams. The bank said in
January  fourth-quarter profit  climbed 39 percent as it gained
from lending and reduced provisions. First Gulf retreated 1.9
percent, the most since Jan. 16, to 21.1 dirhams.  The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  fell 0.2
percent.  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  increased less
than 0.1 percent, its 13th day of gains. Bahrain’s  gauge  climbed
0.4 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  advanced 0.4 percent, its ninth
day of gains and the longest winning streak since March 2010.
Kuwait’s  gauge  climbed 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
