Zwelinzima Vavi , the general
secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, will
seek another term as head of the labor union federation when it
holds its national congress in September, Business Day reported,
citing Vavi.  Vavi has been head of Cosatu for 12 years, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said. He doesn’t plan to stand for
election to any leadership position within the ruling  African
National Congress  as it would compromise his independence,
Business Day quoted Vavi as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
