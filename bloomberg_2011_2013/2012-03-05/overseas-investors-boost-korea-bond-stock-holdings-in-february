Global funds raised their holdings
of South Korean bonds in February by the most since July and
bought more stocks than they sold for a third month, according
to the financial regulator.  The value of local-currency bonds owned by overseas
investors rose by 1.8 trillion won ($1.6 billion) to 86.4
trillion won, 7.1 percent of outstanding notes, the  Financial
Supervisory Service  said in an e-mailed statement today.
Expectations for the won to appreciate and a stable economy are
spurring global demand for investments in  South Korea , the
regulator said.  Funds based in Luxembourg were the biggest buyers of Korean
debt with their ownership increasing by 952 billion won, while
those in the U.S. boosted holdings by 882.5 billion won, FSS
data showed. Chinese investors increased their holdings by 0.1
billion won in February after net investment of 7 billion won in
January and 34 billion won in December, according to the
financial watchdog.  Overseas investors bought 3.9 trillion won more of the
nationâ€™s equities than they sold last month, according to the
FSS. Investors based in U.K. were the biggest buyers, followed
by those in the U.S. and the  Cayman Islands , it said.  The won strengthened 0.4 percent against the dollar in
February after gaining 2.6 percent in January, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Three-year government bond yields rose
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.45 percent
last month, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of
shares gained 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
