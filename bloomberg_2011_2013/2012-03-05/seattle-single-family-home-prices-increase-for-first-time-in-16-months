Single-family  home prices  in Seattle
rose in February for the first time in 16 months, suggesting the
city’s housing market may be bottoming, a brokers group said.  The median price climbed 2.8 percent to $365,000 from
$355,000 a year earlier, according to the Northwest Multiple
Listing Service, a broker-owned group in Kirkland,  Washington .
It was the first increase since October 2010, when the median
price rose 4.3 percent to $417,000, the group said today.
Completed sales jumped 7.8 percent to 316 homes, and contracts
to buy single-family houses jumped 13 percent to 639.  Including condominiums, pending sales rose 22 percent to
891 homes, and completed deals increased 10 percent to 444, the
listing service said. The median price for all  Seattle  homes
fell 5.3 percent to $329,250.  “Buyers are beginning to realize that we may have seen the
bottom of this real estate market,” Frank Wilson, managing
broker of the Poulsbo, Washington, branch of  John L. Scott  Real
Estate, said in a statement.  The market is still being held back by homes sold for less
than the debt owed on a property and sales of foreclosed homes,
said Wilson, a member of the listing service’s board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
