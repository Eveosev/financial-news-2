Corporate profits that doubled since
2009 have left the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  cheaper  than at
all 34 peaks since 1989, even as options traders push the cost
of protecting against losses to the highest in four years.  Companies in the benchmark gauge of U.S. stocks trade for
14.1 times earnings after advancing  102 percent  since March 2009
to an almost four-year high last week, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Valuations are lower than at  every 52-week peak 
since 1989. Traders have pushed the price of contracts that pay
should the S&P 500 drop 20 percent to the most since 2007
compared with ones betting on a rally of the same size.  Rising  oil prices  and concern European leaders have yet to
contain the credit crisis are keeping investors from paying more
for profits, which are  projected  to reach annual records through
2013. Bears say equities aren’t cheap because the profit
estimates are too optimistic. Bulls say shrinking price-earnings
ratios provide a margin of safety should gains in the  U.S.
economy  fail to match forecasts.  “Stocks have just gotten too cheap,” Paul Zemsky, the New
York-based head of  asset allocation  for ING Investment
Management, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees
$160 billion. “We were worrying about a Chinese hard landing
that didn’t happen. We worried about a U.S. double dip and that
didn’t happen. We worried about  Europe  disintegrating, that
didn’t happen. The worst risks have passed.”  Weekly Gain  The S&P 500 climbed 0.3 percent to 1,369.63  last week  and
closed at 1,374.09 on March 1, the highest since 2008, as
jobless claims fell to a four-year low and consumer confidence
improved. The gauge slipped 0.3 percent to 1,365.66 at 9:36 a.m.
New York time today.  The index was 6 points above its 2011 high of 1,363.61 last
week, even as its price-earnings ratio fell from 15.6. Companies
from  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  in  Abbott Park ,  Illinois , to  Memphis ,
Tennessee-based  International Paper Co. (IP)  have rallied while
valuations shrunk.  Profits grew 99 percent between the end of 2009 and 2011,
and are forecast to rise another 12 percent this year and 13
percent next,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Nine quarters of  earnings growth  have outpaced the index’s
advance, leaving valuations 14 percent below the five-decade
average of 16.4. The price-earnings ratio hasn’t been this low
while the index was at a 52-week high in 23 years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg that excludes peaks that occurred
within a month of one another.  Stay Away  Investors are shunning equities after one of the most
volatile years on record, a period when 10-year U.S. Treasury
bonds returned 9.8 percent compared with nothing for stocks.
Concern  Greece  would default on its debt,  six increases  to
lender reserve requirements by the People’s Bank of  China  and
U.S. unemployment above 9 percent sent the  S&P 500  down more
than 19 percent between April and October before recovering.  “What you’re seeing is a gigantic exercise in behavioral
finance,” Brian Barish, who helps oversee about $7 billion as
Denver-based president of Cambiar Investors LLC, said of the
multiple in a Feb. 29 phone interview. “It isn’t fair, but it
is understandable. The ability to scare the hell out of people
is much greater than the ability to attract them to equities.”  Options traders have increased bearish bets even as shares
gained and earnings  exceeded  estimates by 3.1 percent in the
fourth quarter. Six-month puts to protect against a 20 percent
decline in the S&P 500 have an implied volatility of 29.09.
That’s 2.2 times higher than calls to bet on a 20 percent gain,
Bloomberg data on the price relationship known as skew show.  Peak Margins  Low valuations and rising options costs reflect investor
concern about earnings after  profit margins  in the S&P 500 rose
nine straight quarters and reached 14 percent between October
and December, said Eric Teal, who manages $4 billion at First
Citizens Bancshares Inc. Profitability has only been higher
during five quarters in 2006 and 2007 and one in 1999. In both
cases, the S&P 500 was in a  bear market  within a year.  Margins averaged 10 percent between 1991 and 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is an underlying concern that profit margins have
peaked and will begin to contract in coming years,” Teal, the
Raleigh, North Carolina-based chief investment officer, said
Feb. 28. “Thus, investors are unwilling to pay up for earnings
that are clouded with uncertainty.”  Bearish Bets  For  Keith Wirtz , who oversees $14.6 billion as chief
investment officer for Fifth Third Asset Management in
Cincinnati, there’s little surprise in options rising after the
S&P 500 gained 25 percent in five months. The last time  bearish 
bets were this high relative to bullish ones was in May 2007.
The S&P 500 reached the highest  price-earnings ratio  in two
years the following month and a record high of 1,565.15 in
October 2007. What followed was the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression, with equity losses of 57 percent through
March 2009.  “You’ve got risk coming from everywhere,” Wirtz said in a
Feb. 29 phone interview. “That’s why the markets are skittish.
You can’t put a measurement against those risks. How do you put
probabilities on these kinds of outcomes? You just have to
discount the worst, which is what they’re doing.”  The rally that restored  more than $3.2 trillion  to U.S.
equity value since October is pushing up indicators used by
analysts who use charts to predict future prices. About two-
thirds of  New York  Stock Exchange-listed  companies  closed last
week above their 200-day moving average. The 14-day  relative
strength index  for the S&P 500, which compares the magnitude of
gains and losses, has exceeded 70 on 13 days since Jan. 25. Some
investors use that level as a signal a rally has come too far,
too fast.  Reaching Peaks  Of the 500 companies in the benchmark equity gauge, 67
reached 52-week highs last week, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That compares with 31 in the same week last year. Shares
of Abbott, the maker of nutritional drinks, heart stents and
drugs, reached the highest level in three years, even as its
earnings multiple shrunk to 12.1 from 12.6 in May, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Profits excluding some items  increased  12
percent a year since 2009 while shares rose an average 2.4
percent each year.  International Paper’s  earnings  haven’t trailed analyst
forecasts since 2008 and the stock reached its highest price
since November 2007 last week. The world’s largest pulp and
paper producer’s price-earnings ratio fell 35 percent in the
past 12 months to 10.1, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Target Earnings  Annual profit at  Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest U.S.
discount retailer, has climbed 15 percent on average since
fiscal 2010. Even after reaching an almost 14-month high on
March 1, the shares are trading at 13.5 times earnings, compared
with 13.6 in October and the average of 19 since 1990.  “A number of recent trends have emerged which should
support stronger corporate profits, including better U.S.
economic data, less-severe results in Europe, higher oil prices
and reduced financial sector stress,”  Jonathan Golub , chief
U.S. market strategist at UBS Securities LLC in New York, wrote
last week, raising his year-end estimate for the S&P 500 to
1,475 from 1,325. “Conditions support further increases in both
earnings and stock prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
