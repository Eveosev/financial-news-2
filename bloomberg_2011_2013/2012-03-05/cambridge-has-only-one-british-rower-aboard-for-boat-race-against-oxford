Cambridge will only have one British
oarsman in its boat as it takes on Oxford in the annual  Boat
Race  on the Thames next month.  Itâ€™s the first time for Cambridge -- and only the second
time in Boat Race history -- that the crew will have only one
British rower, organizers said in an e-mailed statement today.
Undergraduate Mike Thorp is the only British athlete in the
squad.  The 158th edition of the Boat Race between  Cambridge
University  and Oxford University will be held April 7. The
contest started in 1829 after a Cambridge student wrote to an
Oxford friend proposing a race. The event takes place over a
4.25-mile (6.8 kilometer) course on the River Thames in west
London, lasting about 20 minutes.  The rest of the Cambridge boat will be made up of three
Americans, two Australians, and individuals from  Germany  and  New
Zealand . The only other time only one rower was British was in
2007, when Robin Ejsmond-Frey was in the Oxford boat.  The Oxford crew consists of five Britons, two Americans,
and individuals from Germany and the Netherlands.  Oxford won the race last year, taking the lead from the
start and beating favorites Cambridge by about four boat
lengths.  Cambridge is the heavier crew this year, with its oarsmen
averaging 96.3 kilos (212 pounds) each, compared to 88.4 kilos
for Oxford. The weight difference -- 7.9 kilos -- is the second
biggest ever, with only the victorious Oxford boat of 1990
having a larger margin. The heavier crew has won 7 of the last
10 races.  To contact the reporter on this story:
