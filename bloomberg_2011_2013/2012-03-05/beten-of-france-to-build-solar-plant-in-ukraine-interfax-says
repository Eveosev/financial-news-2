Beten International , a French
engineering company, plans to build a solar-power plant in
southern Ukraine this year,  Interfax-Ukraine  reported.  Beten intends to open the first 3-megawatt unit before
2013, the newswire said, citing the head of the companyâ€™s local
division, Dmytro Paliy. The plant, to be built in the Kherson
region, will have total output of 28 megawatts to 30 megawatts,
Interfax reported, without saying when it may be completed.  The project needs about 50 million euros ($66 million) of
investments, according to the news service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
