U.S. stocks fell, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest two-day loss since
January, as China cut its economic growth target and orders to
American factories decreased for the first time in three months.  Commodity (S5MATR) , technology and industrial shares dropped the
most among 10 groups in the  S&P 500 .  Alcoa (AA)  Inc. and  Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT)  fell at least 2.1 percent.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  slumped 2.2 percent,
snapping a seven-day advance.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  dropped more than 1.2 percent. International
Business Machines Corp. closed above  $200 (IBM)  on a split-adjusted
basis for the first time, after rallying 9.1 percent in 2012.  The S&P 500 retreated 0.4 percent to 1,364.33 at 4 p.m. New
York time, dropping 0.7 percent in two days. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  decreased 14.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to
12,962.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.9 percent to
2,950.48. About 6.1 billion shares  changed hands  on U.S.
exchanges, or 9 percent below the three-month average.  “It’s wise to take a little money off the table,” said
David Joy, the Boston-based chief market strategist at
Ameriprise Financial Inc. His firm oversees $631 billion. “Some
of the easy gains have already been made. We’re back to focusing
on the economic fundamentals.  China  saying that they are
targeting 7.5 percent growth raises concern of a hard landing.”  Equities joined a global slump as China pared its growth
target to 7.5 percent from an 8 percent goal in place since
2005. In the U.S., data on orders to factories signaled
manufacturing is cooling.  Bookings (TMNOCHNG)  fell 1 percent in January
after a revised 1.4 percent gain in December that was larger
than previously estimated.  Economic Surprise  A drop in Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index for the U.S.
is one of several concerns for the market in the short-term,
according to Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at
Citigroup. The index, which measures the extent to which
economic reports beat or miss forecasts, fell to  45.10 (CESIUSD)  on March
2 from 83.70 on Feb. 3. The  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose 8.5 percent  this year 
amid better-than-estimated economic data.  “Too many data points are signaling near-term caution, and
sticking to our disciplines always trumps emotions,” Levkovich
wrote. Because the  gauge  is based on performance compared with
estimates, “one does not have to predict any bad economic data
in the months ahead to believe the surprise index will move
lower from current extended levels,” which “may put some near-
term downward pressure on stock prices.”  Companies most-tied to the economy slumped, sending the
Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index down 1.3 percent. Alcoa, the
biggest U.S. aluminum producer, lost 3.6 percent to $9.87.
Caterpillar, the largest construction and mining-equipment
maker, slid 2.1 percent to $110.09.  Banks Slump  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  declined 1.3 percent. Bank of America
slumped 2 percent to $7.97. Citigroup lost 1.2 percent to $33.68
after naming board member Michael O’Neill to be chairman to
succeed Richard Parsons, who is stepping down after overseeing
the company’s recovery from near-collapse in 2008.  Apple sank 2.2 percent to $533.16, sending its market
capitalization below  $500 billion . The stock rallied 6.3 percent
in  seven days  as investors anticipated a sales boost from the
company’s latest iPad tablet computer, due on March 7.  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  tumbled 4.9 percent to $13.97. The biggest
developer of games for social-networking sites was cut to
neutral from overweight by JPMorgan Chase & Co., meaning the
shares are expected to perform in line with the stocks the
analyst covers over the next six-to-twelve months.  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  decreased 5.7 percent to
$9.96, while  Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP)  retreated 7.5
percent to $9.76. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. cut its
 recommendation  for the shares.  CF Industries  CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF)  fell 5.5 percent to $177.98
after being  cut  to “neutral” from “buy” at Citigroup Inc.
and removed from the firm’s “Top Picks Live” list.  IBM, the world’s biggest computer-services provider, rose
for a third day. The shares added 0.9 percent to $200.66.  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  rallied 2 percent to
$30.39. The  insurer  that received a bailout after the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is selling $6 billion of AIA
Group Ltd. shares to help pay back the U.S. government.  Big Lots Inc. (BIG)  climbed 3.4 percent to $44.15. The discount
retailer was raised to “buy” from “neutral” at Northcoast
Research. The 12-month share-price estimate is $53.  Corporate profits that doubled since 2009 have left the S&P
500  cheaper  than at all 34 peaks since 1989, even as options
traders push the cost of protecting against losses to the
highest in four years.  Four-Year High  The S&P 500 rose  102 percent  since March 2009 to an almost
four-year high last week. Valuations are lower than at  every 52-
week peak  since 1989. Traders have pushed the price of contracts
that pay should the S&P 500 drop 20 percent to the most since
2007 compared with ones betting on a rally of the same size.  Rising oil prices and concern European leaders have yet to
contain the credit crisis are keeping investors from paying more
for profits, which are  projected  to reach annual records through
2013. Bears say equities aren’t cheap because the profit
estimates are too optimistic. Bulls say shrinking  price-earnings 
ratios provide a margin of safety should gains in the  U.S.
economy  fail to match forecasts.  “Stocks have just gotten too cheap,” Paul Zemsky, the New
York-based head of asset allocation for ING Investment
Management, said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees
$160 billion. “We were worrying about a Chinese hard landing
that didn’t happen. We worried about a U.S. double dip and that
didn’t happen. We worried about  Europe  disintegrating, that
didn’t happen. The worst risks have passed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
