Salzgitter AG (SZG)  (SZG), the German steelmaker
that posted a fourfold gain in full-year profit today, fell the
most in four months in Frankfurt trading after saying Europe’s
debt crisis will make it “challenging” to match 2011 results.  Salzgitter (SZG)  sank 5.4 percent to close at 42.88 euros. That’s
the steepest one-day slump since Nov. 1 and the second-biggest
decline in the seven-member  Bloomberg Europe Steel Index. (BESTEEL)  Pretax
earnings rose to 201.6 million euros ($266.7 million) in 2011
from 48.9 million euros a year earlier, it said in a statement.  “Delivering a repeat of the previous year’s results will
be challenging, as the start to the new year appears to be
marked by dampening effects on the course of business in the
Steel and Tubes divisions,” the company said. Sales will remain
“stable at the minimum” this year and “positive” earnings
before tax can be achieved, it said.  Steelmakers are battling to bolster earnings as cooling
economic growth in  China  and Europe sap demand.  ArcelorMittal (MT) ,
the biggest producer, posted its lowest quarterly profit in two
years last month and  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  said Feb. 14 it was unable
to give a “reliable” outlook given the sovereign debt crisis.  “Making reliable statements on the development of the
business situation in the coming quarters is as impossible as
giving a sound, detailed earnings forecast for the Salzgitter
Group,” the company said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
