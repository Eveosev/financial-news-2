Tanzania ’s benchmark coffee fell 0.2
percent at an auction on March 1 after supplies increased, the
Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The average price for the benchmark arabica AA grade
dropped to $233.23 per 50 kilograms (110 pounds) from $233.70 a
week earlier, the board said today by e-mail from Moshi, in
northern Tanzania. Supplies of the grade jumped 31 percent to
2,623 bags, it said.  Overall prices at the auction eased $13.40 per 50 kilograms
for mild arabicas and $4.15 for robustas because of declining
quality of the beans as the nation draws closer to the end of
the season, it said. The board won’t hold an auction this week
because of a drop in supplies, it said.  Supplies of the beans retreated 11 percent to 9,779 bags
from a week earlier, while sales fell 48 percent to 4,670 bags,
it said. The board supplies and sells the beans in 60-kilogram
bags, but costs the beans in 50-kilogram sacks.   Production for this marketing season, which started July 1
and closes June 30, may fall to 37,000 metric tons from the July
14 forecast of 45,000 tons, Adolph Kumburu, the board’s director
general, said Jan. 30.  The following are details of the March 1 auction in U.S.
dollars for a 50-kilogram bag for higher-quality grades:
