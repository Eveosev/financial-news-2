Wheb Group added a team of former
Henderson Global Investors Ltd. employees to help run a
sustainable-resources investment fund that’s seeking to amass
more than 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion).  The four members joined Wheb Asset Management to work on
the  IM Wheb Sustainability Fund , George Latham, former head of
Henderson’s socially responsible investing, or SRI, said by
telephone from London. Latham is leading the team.  The fund, which started in June 2009, is focusing on
resource-efficiency investments rather than renewables stocks as
solar and wind-power companies grapple with surplus capacity and
weakening state support. The fund targets businesses working in
areas such as climate protection and water, according to Latham.  “In a time that’s been extraordinarily difficult for a
number of clean-energy companies, the dominant theme has been
around resource efficiency,” he said March 2. “Companies which
enable us to use resources more efficiently see a very rapid
payback to a lot of their products,” he said, declining to
specify investments.  Latham plans to increase the fund to “significantly over 1
billion pounds,” up from about 30 million pounds now, he said,
without giving a time frame.  Latham and his former colleagues on the SRI team at London-
based Henderson, including Tim Dieppe, Seb Beloe and Hyewon Kong, left after the company decided against having a specialist
SRI fund in its portfolio, Latham said. Their departure was
announced in December.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
