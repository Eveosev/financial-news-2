German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government is open to a compromise on increasing the euro area’s
500 billion-euro ($660 billion) firewall,  Die Welt  reported.  German officials, who have until now said there is no need
to bolster the permanent European Stability Mechanism when it
comes into force in July, now conclude that they can’t hold
their line against efforts by fellow  European Union members , the
 International Monetary Fund  and the U.S. to raise the firewall,
Welt said, citing unidentified government officials.  Some of Germany’s international partners are pressing for
the ESM to be allowed to run concurrently with the remaining
funds in its predecessor, the temporary European Financial
Stability Facility. However, Germany still seeks to prevent
running the two funds together, a prospect that would yield a
firewall of 940 billion euros, according to Die Welt.  Under the compromise favored in Berlin, Merkel’s government
would allow the permanent ESM to use the full 500 billion euros
at its disposal, Welt said. Since the EFSF will have already
committed 200 billion euros,  Germany  will argue that the total
firewall would amount to 700 billion euros, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
