United Grain Co.,  Russia ’s state
grain trader, was opened to interested parties today as the
country sells stakes in government-controlled companies.  Troika Dialog started to collect expressions of interest in
United Grain, the Moscow-based brokerage said in a website
 statement . Applications can be submitted until noon on March 20.  The government plans to issue additional stock and sell as
much as 50 percent minus one share of United Grain before May 8,
according to a presidential decree last year. The company, set
up three years ago to buy cereals and ship grains abroad, will
use private investment to increase grain-handling capacity at
ports to 16 million metric tons a year by 2015 and silo storage
to 8.4 million tons, according to United Grain data.  The trader expanded handling capacity to 4.5 million tons
last year at its terminal in Novorossiysk, Russia’s main grain
export hub, company data show. It had at least 1.2 million tons
of storage capacity, it said in June.  Summa Group, a Russian port operator and builder, is
interested in buying a stake in United Grain, Chairman Ziyavudin
Magomedov said Feb 3. His brother Magomed, who owns stakes in
some of Summa’s assets, entered Russia’s top 10 grain exporters
this season after shipping about 300,000 tons of cereals from
July 1 through February via his OOO Danton trader,  Vedomosti 
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
