Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) , the
largest video-game maker, hired a  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  executive to
fill its open chief financial officer position.  Dennis Durkin, 41, replaces Thomas Tippl, who was promoted
to Activision’s chief operating officer in March 2010 and had
been handling his previous role in finance for the interim until
a replacement was named, the Santa Monica, California-based
company said today in a statement.  At Microsoft, Durkin served as corporate vice president and
chief operating and financial officer of Microsoft’s Interactive
Entertainment Business, which includes the Xbox game-console
business. He had been at Microsoft since 1999.  Tippl will continue to oversee Activision’s publishing
business and Blizzard Entertainment’s operational activities,
the company said. His areas of responsibility include strategic
planning, global sales and supply chain, and oversight of the
legal and human resources departments.  Activision advanced 0.3 percent to $11.71 at the close in
 New York . The shares have lost 5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
