Yields on Mexican peso-denominated
bonds rose to a seven-week high as concern that  Greece ’s debt
writedown may be rejected by many private creditors this week
eroded demand for emerging-market securities.  The yield on the debt due in 2024 rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 6.57 percent at 8:38 a.m. in  Mexico 
City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close at that
level would be the highest since Jan. 11. The price of the
securities fell 0.20 centavo to 129.59 centavos per peso.  The success of the 106 billion-euro ($140 billion) debt
swap, confirmed on the eve of last week’s European Union summit,
depends on how many investors agree to the writedown by the
March 8 deadline. Mexico’s local bonds rallied at the beginning
of this year as investors boosted holdings of the country’s
fixed-income assets in part on speculation that European leaders
would resolve the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  “It has to do still with this European problem and the
Greek exchange and the uncertainty that still exists around
that,” Alejandro Urbina, who oversees $800 million of assets at
Silva Capital Management, said by phone from Wilmette,  Illinois .  Mexico plans to sell dollar-denominated bonds due 2044 in a
benchmark offering as soon as today, according to a person
familiar with the transaction.  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 12.8239 per  U.S. dollar , from
12.7599 on March 2. The currency has gained 8.7 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
