JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp.,
 Japan â€™s biggest refiner, said it plans to idle a 149-megawatt
thermal power plant at its Osaka refinery on March 12 for a
checkup.  The units will be restarted on April 12, a company official
said by phone, declining to be identified because of internal
policy. No maintenance shutdowns are scheduled for refining
units this year at the 115,000 barrel-a-day refinery, operated
by a venture with PetroChina Co., he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
