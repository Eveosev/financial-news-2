New Jersey Nets center Brook Lopez
will miss the next three weeks with a sprained right ankle, an
injury that comes after he sat out this season’s first 33 games
with a broken bone in his right foot.  Lopez, 23, has been limited to five games for the Nets this
season, averaging 19.2 points and 3.6 rebounds. He was injured
during the third quarter of a March 4 win against the  Charlotte
Bobcats  and will have his foot placed in a walking boot as a
precaution, the team said in a statement.  The 7-foot (2.14 meter) Lopez hadn’t missed a game during
his first three years in the  National Basketball Association  and
averaged a team-leading 20.4 points a game for the Nets last
season.  Lopez has been considered one of the main assets the Nets
would use in efforts to acquire All-Star center  Dwight Howard ,
who’s in the final year of his contract with the Orlando Magic.  The Nets, who have a 12-26 record, visit the  Miami Heat 
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
