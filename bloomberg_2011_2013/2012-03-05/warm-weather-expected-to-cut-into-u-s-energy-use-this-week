U.S. energy demand for heating is
expected to be lower than normal this week because of warmer
weather, according to forecasts.  The U.S. heating degree days value through March 10 may
reach 127, or 24 below normal and 12 lower than last year,
according to a weekly forecast by the national  Climate
Prediction Center  in  Camp Springs ,  Maryland .  Across the East, 10 to 30 percent less energy will be
needed for heating from March 6 to March 12, said  David Salmon ,
owner of Weather Derivatives, in Belton, Missouri.  Traders watch temperature predictions and heating degree
days values to gauge energy use and demand. About 51 percent of
U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the
Energy Department.  Temperatures across the central U.S. into the Northeast,
including New York and Chicago, are expected to be 5 to 7
degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 to 3.8 Celsius) above normal, MDA
EarthSat Weather said in a forecast for March 5 to March 9.  Southern Canada, northern New England and upstate  New York 
are expected to average 3 to 4 degrees above normal, said MDA in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. Florida is forecast to be seasonal.  The degree days values are calculated by subtracting the
daily average temperature from a base of 65 degrees to show
energy demand. Higher values mean cooler weather and more energy
being used to heat homes and businesses.  Weighted Values  The gas-weighted value for the week is expected to be 138,
or 25 below normal, the climate center said. The value adjusted
for heating oil may be 179, or 26 lower than normal, while the
electric heat-weighted value may be 95, 18 below normal.  Warm weather across the U.S. is expected to build through
the month, according to  Matt Rogers , president of the Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  Average temperatures from Montana to Massachusetts are
expected to be 8 degrees higher than normal from March 10 to
March 14, Rogers said in a note to clients.  Average temperatures are expected to be 15 degrees above
normal from the Midwest through the Ohio Valley to the Northeast
by March 15 to March 19, Rogers said.  “We find a more consistent pattern view this morning with
the models showing good agreement on the big warming scenario
for the 6- to 15-day in the Midwest, East and even a bit more in
the South,” Rogers said.  The average normal temperature for New York for March 14 is
42 degrees, according to MDA. It is 38 in  Boston , 38 in  Chicago ,
58 in Dallas, 46 in  St. Louis , 46 in Seattle and 58 in Burbank,
 California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
