Spain ’s bonds fell for a second day
after a report showed European services and manufacturing output
shrank more than analysts estimated, underlining the fragility
of the region’s economy.  Italian  10-year bonds  snapped six days of gains after
 European Central Bank  governing council member Jens Weidmann
said he wants to tighten rules on collateral the central bank
will accept in return for its loans and as China cut its growth
forecast. Two-year  Spanish note yields  advanced as the cost of
insuring against default on European sovereign debt rose to the
highest in almost seven weeks amid concern Greece will struggle
to settle a bond swap to prevent it from defaulting on its debt.  “The factoring in of an increase in growth is yet to come
in the European market and we need to clear up a lot of
uncertainty first,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London. “There are still other sources of uncertainty in the
periphery and that’s going to keep core markets well
supported,” he said.  Spain’s 10-year  bond yield  climbed six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 4.97 percent at 4:23 p.m. London time.
The 5.85 percent bond due January 2022 fell 0.505, or 5.05 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,317) face amount, to 106.75. Two-year yields
rose six basis points to 2.31 percent.  Purchasing Managers  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  in both industries dropped to 49.3 in February from
50.4 the previous month, London-based Markit Economics said.
That’s below an initial figure of 49.7 published on Feb. 22. A
reading less than 50 indicates contraction. Euro-area retail
sales unexpectedly rose in January, according to a separate
report from the European Union’s statistics office.  China  pared its economic growth target to 7.5 percent from
an 8 percent goal in place since 2005 today.  Italy’s 10-year yield was three basis points higher at 4.93
percent after declining more than 2 percentage points over the
past eight weeks.  The Frankfurt-based ECB will keep its benchmark  interest
rate  at a record low 1 percent to support the economy at its
March 8 meeting, according to a Bloomberg survey.  ‘Substantial Risks’  Spain’s  10-year rate  has fallen more than 80 basis points
and the Italian two-year note yield has tumbled more than 4
percentage points since the ECB announced its plan to offer
unlimited loans for three years on Dec. 8. Banks have taken more
than 1 trillion euros in two operations since then.  Weidmann, who heads  Germany ’s Bundesbank, said euro-area
central banks are taking “substantial risks” onto their
balance sheets and the loans given by the ECB under its longer-
term refinancing operations are at the “limits” of the euro
system’s mandate.  The loan conditions have become “very generous,” Spiegel
magazine quoted Weidmann as saying. “The program has a calming
effect in the short term, but it’s a calm that could be
deceptive,” he said, according to the magazine.  The  German 10-year bund yield  advanced two basis points to
1.82 percent after falling to 1.77 percent, the lowest since
Jan. 18.  Spain defied its EU allies last week by raising its deficit
target for this year, announcing a new estimate of 5.8 percent
of gross domestic product compared with the previously agreed
4.4 percent. Spain overshot last year’s deficit target by 2.5
percentage points.  Commission Waits  The European Commission will wait until it has the “full
picture” on Spain’s 2011 deficit and 2012 budget plans in April
before making a judgment on the nation’s compliance with
European rules, spokesman  Amadeu Altafaj  said today.  “The LTRO is now done, so it’s not really going to be a
big story anymore and the markets will refocus on all the bits
and pieces that could throw spanners in the works and the
situation in Spain is just one of them,” said Elwin de Groot, a
market economist at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht. “We will see
more of these types of stories because Spain is not the only
country struggling with a budget deficit target that has
exceeded estimates.”  France ’s two-year yields rose two basis points to 0.50
percent. The nation sold 8.5 billion euros of 91-, 182- and 364-
day bills today.  The Netherlands sold 1.09 billion euros of 205-day bills at
an average yield of 0.032 percent. Investors bid for 3.34 times
the number of securities allotted.  Portuguese Volatility  German bonds have returned 0.3 percent this year, after
gaining 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. French securities rose 2.3 percent in 2012 and
Spanish bonds returned 3.5 percent, the indexes show.  Volatility in Portuguese debt was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by  Greece , according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  The yield on Greece’s  10-year bonds  declined 56 basis
points to 36.54 percent. The price rose to 19 percent of face
value, from 18.63 percent last week.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments jumped 4.5 basis points to
349.5, the highest since Jan. 18, according to BNP Paribas SA.
It now costs $7.6 million in advance and $100,000 annually to
insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years, signaling a 98
percent chance of default in that time, according to CMA.  Investors have until March 8 to agree to so-called private-
sector involvement aimed at cutting the nation’s debt load by
more than 100 billion euros and avoid default. There’s growing
concern not enough bondholders will take part in the swap,
causing Greece to use collective action clauses to enforce
losses on all investors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
