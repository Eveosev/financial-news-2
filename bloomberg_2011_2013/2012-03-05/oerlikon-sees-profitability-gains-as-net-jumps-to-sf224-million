OC Oerlikon Corp AG (OERL)  said it expects
profitability to increase next year as its net income jumped to
224 million Swiss francs in 2011 from 5 million francs a year
earlier.  Profitability, as expressed by the earnings before interest
and tax margin, rose to 10 percent in 2011 from 1% in 2010, and
may reach 11 percent this year, Oerlikon said today in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
