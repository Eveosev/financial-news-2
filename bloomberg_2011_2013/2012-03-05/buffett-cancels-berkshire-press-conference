Warren Buffett , chairman and chief
executive officer of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , opted against
hosting a press conference following his company’s annual
meeting in May.  “We have decided to cancel Sunday’s press conference due
to time constraints,” Carrie Kizer, Buffett’s assistant, said
today in an e-mail. The annual meeting is held in Omaha,
Nebraska.  Buffett, 81, and Vice Chairman Charles Munger, 88, are
scheduled to preside over the Berkshire shareholders’ meeting on
Saturday, May 5. In past years, reporters from the U.S. and
around the world have attended a press event with the two men
the following day. In 2010, Berkshire discontinued an event it
had previously held for non-U.S. shareholders.  Buffett will take questions from a panel of three
journalists and three financial analysts at the  shareholders’
meeting . The journalists have been instructed to choose
questions submitted by shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
