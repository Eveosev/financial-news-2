China , the world’s biggest energy
user, is “very likely” to resume approval of new nuclear
projects in 2012 as the government completes a safety review
prompted by the Fukushima disaster last year.  “The government is coming up with a revised plan for
nuclear development and is very likely to resume approvals for
new plants this year,” Sun Qin, president of China National
Nuclear Corp., said in an interview in Beijing.  China halted new nuclear projects after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  crippled the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
station and prompted a global review of atomic plants. China
National Nuclear, the country’s biggest atomic plant builder, is
maintaining equipment orders this year, Sun said.  “There was a slight pause last year, and we’re definitely
continuing with our orders,” Sun said at the Great Hall of the
People during the opening of the country’s legislature.  China, which started operating its first commercial nuclear
plant in 1994, is building at least 27 reactors and has 50 more
planned, according to the China Nuclear Energy Association.  The Ministry of Environmental Protection said Dec. 12 it
has submitted new nuclear safety regulations to the State
Council, or Cabinet.  --Chua Baizhen. With assistance from Guo Aibing in  Hong Kong .
