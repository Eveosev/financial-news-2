Bank of Japan (8301)  Deputy Governor
Kiyohiko Nishimura said the Volcker rule may impair the
liquidity of sovereign debt markets outside the U.S.  The rule ‘could adversely affect the liquidity of overseas
sovereign debt markets,’’ Nishimura said today in a speech in
 Washington . “Some market participants seem uncertain as to how
the Volcker rule would impact the sovereign debt markets as well
as funding issues.”  While Nishimura said he agrees with the fundamental
rationale of the Volcker rule, he urged U.S. policy makers to be
careful in implementing the regulations and pay attention to the
liquidity of sovereign debt markets.  The proposal, requiring a ban on proprietary trading at
banks and planned to be in place by July, is one of the most
contentious provisions of the overhaul of U.S. financial
regulation enacted in 2010 known as the Dodd-Frank act. A 298-
page proposal released by U.S. regulators in October included
more than 1,300 questions for banks to consider during the
comment period.  Officials from  Canada ,  Japan , the  United Kingdom , and the
European Banking Federation have said in letters to the U.S.
Treasury Department and other regulators that the measure would
harm global liquidity and international cooperation. Group of 20
leaders have not endorsed the rule.  The Dodd-Frank act exempted U.S. government securities from
the proprietary trading ban. Foreign sovereign debt isn’t
exempted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
