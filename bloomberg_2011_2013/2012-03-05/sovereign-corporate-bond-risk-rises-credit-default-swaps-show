The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign debt rose to the highest in almost seven
weeks on concern the region’s crisis will worsen as  Greece 
struggles to get investors to agree to a bond swap.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments jumped 4.5 basis points to
349.5, the highest since Jan. 18, according to BNP Paribas SA at
10:46 a.m. in London. It now costs $7.6 million in advance and
$100,000 annually to insure $10 million of Greek debt for five
years, signaling a 98 percent chance of default in that time,
according to CMA.  Investors have until March 8 to agree to so-called private
sector involvement aimed at cutting the nation’s debt load by
more than 100 billion euros ($132 billion) and avoid default.
There’s growing concern not enough bondholders will take part in
the swap, causing Greece to use collective action clauses to
enforce losses on all investors or collapsing the deal.  “Messy default is a possibility, but I think it’s more
likely we see CACs,” said  Bill Blain , a strategist at Newedge
Group in London. “The worst case scenario is PSI doesn’t hit
the level where they can trigger CACs, and they simply
default.”  Swaps on  Spain  overtook  Italy  for the first time since
September after the Madrid government raised its budget-deficit
target on March 2. Credit-default swaps on Spain soared 16 basis
points today to 391, while Italy rose 12 to 375, according to
BNP Paribas. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of
 credit quality .  Commitment Doubt  “Where the market was giving Spain high marks for
addressing its structural problems, now it’s beginning to doubt
their commitment,” Blain said. “People are now beginning to
look at Spain’s crisis with a different eye.”  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 8.5
basis points to 582.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose 2.25 basis points
to 133.25 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 2.5 basis points to 212 and the
subordinated index increased five to 354.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
