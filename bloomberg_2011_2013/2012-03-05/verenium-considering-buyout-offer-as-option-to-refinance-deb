Verenium Corp. (VRNM) , a maker of enzymes
used for making biofuels, said it’s considering a buyout offer
from more than one company as part of its effort to refinance
its debt.  The  San Diego  based company informed holders of $34.9
million in convertible bonds that it will repurchase the notes
on April 2 if it has sufficient cash to complete the
transaction, according to a statement on PR Newswire today.  Verenium also is considering issuing securities to raise
the cash necessary for paying the bondholders. It didn’t name
the bidders offering the buy the company or say what the terms
of the purchase would be, noting instead that there’s no
assurance a definitive agreement will be struck.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
