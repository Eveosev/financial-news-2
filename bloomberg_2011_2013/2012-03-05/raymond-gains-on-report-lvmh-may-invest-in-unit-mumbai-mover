Raymond Ltd. (RW) , an Indian maker of
clothing and fabrics, rose the most in 11 months in Mumbai
trading after a report that the buyout unit of  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  may invest in its garment unit.  The  shares  gained as much as 11 percent, the biggest rise
on an intraday basis since April 27, and were trading 3 percent
higher at 361.5 rupees as of 11:55 a.m. in Mumbai trading. The
benchmark BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  fell 1 percent.  L Capital  Asia , LVMH’s buyout arm, may invest $150 million
for as much as 20 percent of the Raymond unit, the Economic
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  There is “no such proposal before the board of directors
of the company,” Mumbai-based Raymond said in statement to the
Bombay Stock Exchange.  “If they want to make an international expansion, then it
could possibly make sense,” Abhishek Ranganathan, an analyst
with MF Global Sify Securities Pvt. in Mumbai, said in a
telephone interview, referring to Raymond. “Why they want to
raise money is not very clear.”  Ketki Kiran Paranjpe, vice president, L Capital Mumbai
Advisory Services Pvt., declined to comment on the Economic
Times report. Shreyas Joshi, president of apparel at Raymond
wasn’t immediately available at his office to comment.  Raymond’s  shares  have gained 16 percent this year, compared
with a 13 percent increase in the benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
