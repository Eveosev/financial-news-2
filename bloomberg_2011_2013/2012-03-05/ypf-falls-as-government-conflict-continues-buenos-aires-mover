YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentina’s largest energy
company, fell for a second day on speculation that a conflict
with the government over investment plans will continue to pose
risks for the company.  YPF retreated 7 percent to 132.5 pesos at 3:17 p.m. in
 Buenos Aires , adding to a 2.4 percent loss on March 2. The stock
had gained 17 percent on March 1, after President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner didn’t address a potential nationalization
of the company as previously speculated in local newspaper
Ambito Financiero.  “The gain after the speech may have been excessive,”
Augusto Posleman, head of private banking services at Buenos
Aires-based brokerage  Puente Hermanos , said in a phone
interview. “You’ll always see a lot of volatility among any
stocks involved in a conflict such as this one. There haven’t
been any advances during the weekend and volatility will
continue.”  YPF has been under pressure by the government to increase
production after it said  oil companies  doubled fuel imports in
2011.  The southern Argentine province of  Santa Cruz  demanded that
the country’s biggest oil producer and distributor fulfill its
investment commitments, state news agency Telam reported
yesterday. The province of Chubut said March 2 it would give the
company seven days to provide a “working plan” to increase
production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
