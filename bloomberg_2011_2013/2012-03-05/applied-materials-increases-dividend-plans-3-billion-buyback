Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) , the largest
producer of chipmaking equipment, raised its quarterly dividend
by 13 percent to 9 cents a share and said it plans to buy back
as much as $3 billion of its stock in the next three years.  The dividend will be payable June 14 to shareholders of
record May 24, the  Santa Clara , California-based company said
today in a statement. Applied had paid a  dividend  of 8 cents a
share for the past four calendar quarters. The new stock-
repurchase plan follows one started in 2010 that has less than
$1 billion left, the company said.  Applied is  returning more cash  to shareholders after
projecting higher fiscal second-quarter profit than analysts
estimated last month. The forecast signaled that Applied’s
customers -- semiconductor makers -- are stepping up equipment
spending to ensure they can meet demand for chips used in
smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices.  “Today’s dividend increase demonstrates confidence in our
ability to continue to deliver strong cash flow  performance 
across our business cycles,” Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Mike Splinter said in the statement.  Applied Materials fell 1.6 percent to $12.03 at the close
in  New York . The  shares  have jumped 12 percent so far this year,
after declining 24 percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
