Rajon Rondo led the  Boston Celtics 
to a 115-111 overtime victory against the  New York Knicks  with a
statistical performance only equaled by Hall of Fame players
Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson.  Rondo had 18 points, 20 assists and a career-high 17
rebounds yesterday at TD Garden to help spoil the Boston return
of Knicks guard Jeremy Lin, a Harvard University graduate.  Rondo, the Celtics’ point guard, joined Chamberlain and
Robertson as the only players in National Basketball Association
history to record at least 15 points, 20 assists and 15 rebounds
in a game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  “There aren’t many guards, maybe no guards, who can put up
numbers like that,” said Lin, who had 14 points, five assists
and six turnovers. “We didn’t do a good job of containing him
and he obviously controlled the tempo of the game.”  Deron Williams of the  New Jersey Nets  scored a career-high
and franchise-record 57 points yesterday -- the highest in the
NBA this season -- to lead the Nets to a 104-101 win over the
Charlotte Bobcats. Williams hit 16 of 29 shots and all 21 of his
free throw attempts against the Bobcats, who have an NBA-worst
4-31 record this season.  Kobe Bryant  scored 33 points to lead the  Los Angeles Lakers 
to a 93-83 win over the  Miami Heat . It was the eighth straight
home victory for the Lakers (23-14), who have won eight of their
past 10 games to keep pace with the Los Angeles Clippers in the
Western Conference’s Pacific division.  The Clippers beat the Houston Rockets 105-103 in overtime
yesterday as Chris Paul had 28 points and 10 assists.  Rose Leads Bulls  In a meeting of division leaders in the Eastern Conference,
 Derrick Rose  scored 35 points to lead the  Chicago Bulls  to a
96-91 win over the  Philadelphia 76ers . It was the sixth straight
win for the Bulls, who improved to 31-8.  The 76ers fell to 22-16, two games ahead of the second-
place Celtics (19-17) in the Atlantic division.  Paul Pierce  scored 34 points to lead the Celtics and hit a
26-foot 3-pointer with four seconds remaining to force overtime
against the Knicks. The Celtics led by 15 points late in the
third quarter before a rally by the Knicks, who led 103-100 with
18 seconds left in the fourth quarter.  “The biggest thing is we got the win,” Rondo said. “Paul
made that shot to send us into overtime and that was big for us.
If you get those type of numbers and you lose, it’s kind of
irrelevant.”  New York dropped to 18-19 with its fourth defeat in 14
games with Lin at point guard.  Carmelo Anthony led New York with 25 points and seven
rebounds, and Amar’e Stoudemire had 16 points and 13 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
