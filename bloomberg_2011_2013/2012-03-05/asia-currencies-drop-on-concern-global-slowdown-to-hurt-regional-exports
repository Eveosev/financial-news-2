Asian currencies weakened, led by
 Indonesia ’s rupiah and India’s rupee, as concern the global
economy is slowing dimmed the outlook for the region’s exports.  China  set its annual economic growth goal at the lowest
since 2004 as the central bank weakened the currency’s reference
rate by the most since November 2010. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan
Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the region’s 10 most-active
currencies excluding the yen, fell the most since Feb. 14. Spain
raised its 2012 budget-deficit target on March 2, stoking
speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  “China’s gross domestic product target means Asian growth
forecasts will be dragged lower as most economies here are still
export-driven,” said  Vishnu Varathan , an economist at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “If developed markets aren’t
showing sustained and minimum signs of growth, then  Asia  will
feel some of this headwind.”  The rupiah dropped 0.7 percent to 9,142 per dollar as of
3:17 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. India’s rupee slid 0.7 percent to 49.845,
the Philippine peso declined 0.4 percent to 42.88 and South
Korea’s won depreciated 0.3 percent to 1,118.63.  Premier Wen Jiabao set a 7.5 percent GDP target for 2012 in
a state-of-the-nation speech at the National People’s Congress
in Beijing today. China including  Hong Kong  is the single
largest export market for Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand. The
People’s Bank of China weakened the yuan’s daily fixing by 0.22
percent, the most since November 2010. The yuan fell 0.13
percent to 6.3063.  Malaysia’s Exports  India ’s rupee touched a one-month low on speculation
foreign funds will cut purchases of local assets as oil prices
hover near the highest level since May. Crude prices have
advanced 8.3 percent this year, reaching a 10-month high of
$110.55 a barrel in  New York  on March 1. Asia’s third-biggest
economy imports almost 70 percent of its energy needs.  “There is a preference among investors to hold dollars in
comparison to other currencies” due to the high oil prices, said
Naveen Raghuvanshi, a currency trader at Development Credit Bank
Ltd. in Mumbai. “The rupee is weakening because of this
sentiment and I expect further weakness in the near term.”  Malaysia’s ringgit fell 0.5 percent to 3.0190 before a
government report on March 7 may show exports rose 3 percent
from a year earlier in January, the least since October 2010,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The rupiah declined for a third day after global investors
 trimmed  their holdings of government bonds by 9 trillion rupiah
($984 million) to 227 trillion rupiah in February, the most
since September, according to data published by the finance
ministry on its website.  Korean Rate Decision  “The news from  Spain  signals that there is still an
ongoing debt issue in Europe,” said Apressyanti Senthaury, a
Jakarta-based research analyst in the treasury division of PT
Bank Negara Indonesia. “Bank Indonesia will keep the rupiah
from weakening too drastically.”  The won snapped four days of gains as the  Kospi (KOSPI)  index of
shares dropped. The central bank will hold its benchmark
 interest rate  at 3.25 percent on March 8, according to all 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The won will level off as investors seek profits after
the recent rally,” said Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based currency
analyst at Woori Futures Co. “Europe-related issues are making
it difficult for the currency to strengthen further.”  Elsewhere, the Thai baht dropped 0.5 percent to 30.68 per
dollar and the Taiwan dollar slipped 0.2 percent to NT$29.518.
Vietnam’s dong advanced 1 percent to 20,830.  To contact the reporters on this story:
