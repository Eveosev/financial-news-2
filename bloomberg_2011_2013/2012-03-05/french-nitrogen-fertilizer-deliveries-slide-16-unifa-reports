French nitrogen-fertilizer shipments
slumped 16 percent from July through December to the lowest in
at least four years, and deliveries of phosphate and potassium
also fell, national fertilizer-industry association Unifa said.  Nitrogen sales in  France , the European Union’s largest crop
grower, fell to 1.01 million metric tons in the first six months
of the year that began July 1 from 1.2 million tons a year
earlier, Paris-based Unifa said today in an e-mailed statement.  France is the biggest user of crop nutrients in the 27-
nation EU, according to the International Fertilizer Industry
Association. French grain farmers typically buy fertilizer for
next year’s crop after most harvesting is done in September.  Potassium-fertilizer shipments in France fell 10 percent to
315,000 tons in May through December, while phosphate deliveries
declined 24 percent to 248,000 tons, Unifa said.  The association tracks nitrogen sales on the basis of a
year that starts July 1, while the marketing year for potassium
and phosphorus begins May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
