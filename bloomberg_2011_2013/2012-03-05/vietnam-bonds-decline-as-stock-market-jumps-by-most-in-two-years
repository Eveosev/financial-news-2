Vietnam ’s three-year bonds fell,
with yields rising the most in almost two weeks, on speculation
investors favored equities to take advantage of a rallying stock
market. The dong strengthened.  The  VN Index (VNINDEX)  of shares jumped 4 percent today, the most in
more than two years, and has surged 30 percent in 2012, the
third-best performance among 93 major benchmarks tracked by
Bloomberg.  “The strong stock market rally has made investors switch
from some of their safe assets into risky assets,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst at Viet Capital Securities in  Ho Chi Minh
City .  Three-year bond  yields  rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 11.53 percent according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong strengthened 0.7 percent to 20,890 per dollar as
of 4:41 p.m. in Hanoi according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed its daily  reference
rate  at 20,828, according to its website. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
