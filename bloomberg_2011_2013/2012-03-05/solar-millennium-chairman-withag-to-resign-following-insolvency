Solar Millennium AG (S2M) , the insolvent
German solar developer that’s seeking a buyer, said today its
chairman will resign.  Dr. Jan Withag will step down March 8, Erlangen, Germany-
based Solar Millennium said today in a statement. He’s also
leaving the board of the company’s Solar Trust of America and
its Flagsol units.  Insolvency proceedings began last week and the disposition
of the company is now largely managed by a court-appointed
administrator, Withag said in the statement.  “The opportunities for action left to me are limited,” he
said.  The company is seeking investors or a buyer. The insolvency
administrator said Feb. 28 that some of the company’s power
projects may be acquired, and the chances of the entire company
being purchased “are highly uncertain.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
