The Australian dollar may weaken
versus its U.S. peer, falling toward a more than one-week low of
$1.0598, after it failed to break through key resistance levels
last week, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  “The Aussie dollar is expected to stay below the
$1.0815/$1.0857 resistance area, where several February highs
were made,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and
currency technical analysis at Commerzbank in  London , wrote in a
report today. “As long as this is the case, minor support at
$1.0651, the Feb. 27 low, will be targeted, as well as the
three-month uptrend line at $1.0621 and key support at $1.0598,
the late-February low.”  The Australian dollar declined 0.4 percent to $1.0689 at
10:18 a.m. London time after falling as low as $1.0671, the
least since Feb. 27. The currency slid to $1.0598 on Feb. 23,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A sustained break below $1.0598 “will push the 55-day and
200-day moving averages at $1.0507 and $1.0409 to the fore,”
Jones wrote.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance is a level where sell
orders may be clustered, and support is where buy orders may be
grouped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
