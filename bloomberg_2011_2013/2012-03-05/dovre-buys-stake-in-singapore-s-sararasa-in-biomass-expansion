Dovre Group Plc (DOV1V) , a Finnish project
management services provider, bought a minority stake in
Sararasa Biomass Pte. Ltd. to expand into renewable energy.  Dovre will invest about 1.4 million euros ($1.9 million) in
Sararasa’s first project, an Indonesian plant making pellets
from wood waste materials, the Espoo-based company said today in
a statement. Stahl Capital Ltd., a financial investor, also owns
the plant.  Sararasa, based in  Singapore , makes pellets made from waste
such as sawdust or shavings for use in power plants in  Asia . The
waste material is compressed under high pressure to form pellets
that are a “virtually carbon dioxide neutral” source of
energy, according to the company’s website.  “Our intention is to work together with Sararasa on other
biomass-to-energy projects in the future,” Janne Mielck, chief
executive of Dovre, said in the statement. The company, which
had net sales of 73 million euros last year, is studying
developing, financing and managing renewable energy projects
with local developers, according to the statement.  Terms of the transaction weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
