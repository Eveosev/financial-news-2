Investments in mineral exploration
in Ontario rose to a record C$1 billion ($1 billion) in 2011,
the Canadian provinceâ€™s Ministry of Northern Development and
Mines said.  Ontario accounted for 26 percent of mineral exploration
spending in  Canada  last year, up from 20 percent in 2007, the
Ministry said in a statement today. There are 38 active mines
and more than 600 active exploration projects in the province,
it said.  Exploration for gold accounted for more than half of the
total, according to the ministry. Gold has risen for 11 straight
years and reached a record $1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6 in
London spot trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
