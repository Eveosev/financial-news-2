J&F Participacoes SA, the holding
company that controls meatpacker  JBS SA (JBSS3) , will name former
Brazilian central bank president Henrique Meirelles its chairman
today, spokesman Miguel Bueno said.  Meirelles, 66, will be the Sao Paulo-based company’s
“strategist” and will create its board with Chief Executive
Officer Joesley Batista, Bueno said in a telephone interview
from Brasilia on March 3. Batista will remain as chairman of
JBS, the world’s biggest beef producer.  As the longest-serving Brazil’s central bank president,
from beginning of 2003 through the end of 2010, Meirelles
reduced Brazil’s annual  inflation  to 5.91 percent in 2010 from
12.5 percent in 2002, while the country benchmark lending rate,
known as Selic, dropped to a record low of 8.75 percent in 2009.  Meirelles, who lead the Latin American business at
FleetBoston Financial Corp. before joining the government, was
named head of  Brazil ’s Olympic Council last year.  J&F controls Vigor Alimentos SA, the dairy company JBS is
seeking to spin off, pulp maker Eldorado Celulose & Papel SA,
and lender Banco Original.  To contact the reporter on this story:
