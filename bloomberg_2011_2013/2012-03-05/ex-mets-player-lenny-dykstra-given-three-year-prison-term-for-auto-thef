 Lenny Dykstra, a former player for
 Major League Baseball ’s New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies,
was sentenced today to three years in a California state prison
for grand theft auto, said a spokeswoman for the district
attorney in  Los Angeles .  Dykstra pleaded “no contest” to criminal charges in
October after being accused of trying to lease cars using phony
business cards and credit information and with drug possession.
While a no contest plea is technically not an admission of
guilt, it is equivalent to a guilty plea as far as possible
punishment is concerned.  In May, he was charged by federal prosecutors with looting
his mansion in Thousand Oaks, California, and stealing or
destroying more than $400,000 worth of property from his
bankrupt estate. Prosecutors said he removed, destroyed and sold
property from his $18.5 million mansion after filing for
bankruptcy in 2009 in  California . Dykstra shipped chandeliers,
mirrors, artwork and other items from the mansion to a
consignment store, according to court filings.  Dykstra pleaded not guilty to those charges in June.  The auto theft case is People v. Dykstra, PA070678,
California Superior Court (Los Angeles County). The looting case
is U.S. v. Dykstra, 11-415, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Los Angeles). The bankruptcy
case is In re Dykstra, 09-18409,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Central
District of California (San Fernando Valley).  To contact the reporter on this story:
