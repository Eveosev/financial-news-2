Subir Gokarn, deputy governor of the
 Reserve Bank of India , comments on a cash shortfall in the
banking system and crude oil prices. He spoke to reporters in
Mumbai.  “One way of tracking liquidity pressure is the behavior of
the call rate. If the call rate is maybe 20 to 25 basis points
above the repurchase rate, which is typically the scenario when
liquidity conditions are normal, market conditions are orderly.  ‘‘Even though the deficit may be larger than our comfort
zone, there is no instability in the market.  ‘‘We are seeing call rates at around 8.9 percent or so,
which suggests that there are some pressures. Overall, while the
quantum of liquidity deficit is large, the behavior of prices
does suggest that things are relatively stable.  ‘‘There has been a concerted effort to put money. The
market’s absorption capacity has to be taken into account.
That’s the balancing act that we are trying to do.  ‘‘That doesn’t mean that we write off the problem. The
problem still exists and we need to address it. But we’ll
address it in ways that aren’t destabilizing and create other
problems somewhere else.’’  On  oil prices  and the economy:  ‘‘Oil prices going up clearly poses the potential of upside
risk to inflation. On the other hand, with growth having slowed
somewhat, whether these higher input prices can be automatically
passed to consumers, is a question. It is likely that producers
don’t have as much pricing power.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
