OAO Inter RAO UES,  Russia ’s state-
run power generator and trader, may gain control in OAO TGK-6
utility via an asset swap with OAO Gazprom, Kommersant reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Boris Kovalchuk.  Gazprom last year agreed to merge power assets with
billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg ’s utilities including TGK-6 and
TGK-7 and to gain control in the united company. Should the
merger proceed, Inter RAO may exchange its 32 percent stake in
TGK-7 for 42 percent of TGK-6 and cash, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
