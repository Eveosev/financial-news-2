Aabar Investments PJSC (AABAR) , an  Abu Dhabi 
government-controlled company, raised its stake in  Arabtec
Holding Co. (ARTC)  to 5.28 percent, according to data posted on  Dubai’s
stock exchange.   The  shareholding is listed  under Aabar Petroleum
Investments Co., which in 2008 sold its energy assets to
Mubadala Development Co., an  investment company  owned by the Abu
Dhabi government. Arabtec Chief Financial Officer  Ziad Makhzoumi 
couldn’t be reached on his mobile telephone and Aabar officials
were not immediately available for comment.  Arabtec, the biggest construction company by market value
in the United Arab Emirates, has surged 120 percent this year on
speculation investors are accumulating the stock amid bets it
will benefit from regional infrastructure spending. That
compares with a 30 percent gain in Dubai’s  DFM General Index. (DFMGI)   A unit of Arabtec, a builder of the world’s tallest tower
in Dubai, in January won a 25-month contract valued at 561
million dirhams ($153 million) to carry out expansion at Dubai
International Airport. One of its units this year also won
contracts in Abu Dhabi valued at 256 million dirhams.  Aabar Investments (AABAR)  in 2010 canceled a plan to buy most of
Arabtec for an estimated $1.74 billion. Arabtec and Aabar said
they planned instead a “strategic partnership.” Aabar had
offered to buy 70 percent of Arabtec through the purchase of
bonds that would be exchanged for shares at 2.3 dirhams.  Arabtec shares declined 2 percent to 3.5 dirhams today,
giving the company a market value of 5.23 billion dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
