Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of
Societe Generale SA, slid from a three-week high as China cut
its target for economic growth this year, driving investors from
riskier assets worldwide.  The stock dropped 1.2 percent to 3,675 koruna by 10:05 a.m.
in Prague, snapping a four-day rally. The  PX (PX)  equity gauge, where
Komercni has a 17 percent weighting, declined 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
