Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
slammed expansionary monetary conditions in  Europe  during a
visit to Germany, saying her government may take more measures
to stem currency gains being fueled by “protectionist”
policies in rich nations.  Rousseff, speaking to reporters in Hanover before a meeting
with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , dismissed speculation that
Brazil would impose a minimum period for foreign investment to
remain in the country.  “I’m not defending a quarantine,” Rousseff said.  Still, to protect itself from a “monetary tsunami”
unleashed by rich countries, “Brazil as a sovereign nation will
take all necessary measures to protect its economy,” she said.
An example of the type of measures Brazil can take is the recent
increase in the financial transactions tax to limit foreign
investment inflows, she said.  On March 1, Brazil extended to three years the maturity of
foreign loans affected by a 6 percent transaction tax.
Previously loans of only up to two years were levied at that
rate. The real has rallied 7.4 percent this year, more than all
16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the  Mexican peso .  Rousseff said policy makers in Europe and the U.S. were
seeking to “artificially devalue” their currencies in a bid to
stimulate growth. That in turn is causing “extremely toxic”
effects in emerging markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
