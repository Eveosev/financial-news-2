Chinese demand for steel for
automobiles may be higher than last year as the government
encourages spending, Baosteel Group Corp., the nation’s third-
largest steelmaker said.  “The government is encouraging domestic demand,”  Xu Lejiang , chairman at Baosteel that supplies half of  China ’s
automobile steel, said today in an interview in Beijing. “Auto
will be a main driver for demand of our products.”  China excluded foreign brands from a preliminary list for
official-vehicle purchases last month, fueling speculation the
government is stepping up efforts to protect its domestic
industry as they struggle to compete against global producers.
Chinese car sales may also get a boost after the central bank
cut reserve requirements for the second time in three months in
February to increase lending and sustain growth.  Still, demand for steel used in home appliances may be
curbed by slower global growth, Xu said.  “The home appliance sector isn’t looking good because of
weaker exports,” Xu said. “The U.S. and other developed
countries are more prudent in retail consumption due to the
economic slowdown.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
