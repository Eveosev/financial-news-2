McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
largest restaurant operator, will advertise its Happy Meals on
U.S. television beginning March 7 in a push to highlight its
healthier menu options.  The kids’ meal commercials will feature new characters who
tout the benefits of eating Happy Meal items such as apple
slices and fat free chocolate milk, the  Oak Brook , Illinois-
based company said today in a statement.  McDonald’s is working to draw back customers concerned
about children’s health amid surging obesity rates. Last year,
McDonald’s introduced apple slices and smaller packets of French
fries in Happy Meals, reducing calories by about 20 percent. The
average number of menu items that contain at least half a
serving of fruit or vegetables rose to 15.8 in 2010, from 9.9 in
2006, according to the company’s most recent sustainability
 report .  Since 1980, prevalence of obesity among children and
adolescents has almost tripled, according to the U.S.  Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention .  In the new ads, a kid named Ferris lives on a farm with his
goat, who learns how to eat healthier foods as the story
unfolds. Some commercials will advertise Happy Meal toys, which
were banned by the city of  San Francisco  last year.  McDonald’s, which has more than 33,500 locations worldwide,
spent $74.4 million last year primarily for TV and radio ads in
the U.S., according to a company  filing .  The shares rose 0.4 percent to $99.94 at the close in  New
York  and have  gained  31 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
