Nechirvan Barzani will take over as
the new prime minister of  Iraq ’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region
on March 7, the  Kurdistan Regional Government  said.  Iraqi Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani will officially
name his nephew to the post, with Imad Ahmad as deputy prime
minister, and the pair will have 30 days to form a new
government and submit it for a vote of confidence in parliament,
Fouad Hussein, head of the KRG presidency’s office, said in a
statement posted on the KRG website today.  Nechirvan Barzani, who served as KRG prime minister from
2006 to 2009, will replace Barham Salih under an agreement in
which the two main parties in northern Iraq rotate the main
government posts.  Iraq’s northern Kurdish region contains 45 billion barrels
of oil and between 3 trillion and 6 trillion cubic meters of
gas, KRG Natural Resources Minister  Ashti Hawrami  said in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
