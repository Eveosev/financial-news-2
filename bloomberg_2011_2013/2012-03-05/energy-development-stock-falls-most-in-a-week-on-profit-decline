Energy Development Corp. (EDC)  dropped the
most in more than a week after the  Philippines â€™ largest
geothermal company said net income fell 86 percent to 615
million pesos last year.  The stock declined 3.5 percent to 5.20 pesos at 9:59 a.m.
in Manila trading, set for its sharpest fall since Feb. 24. The
company traced the profit drop to a write-off and forgone steam
sales, according to an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
