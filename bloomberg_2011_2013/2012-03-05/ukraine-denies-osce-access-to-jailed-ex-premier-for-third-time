Ukraine stopped the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in  Europe  from visiting jailed former
Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko  for the third time in as many
weeks.  The penitentiary service denied Walburga Habsburg Douglas,
vice president of the Copenhagen-based OSCE Parliamentary
Assembly, access to Tymoshenko in the eastern city of Kharkov
today, the OSCE said in e-mailed statement. Habsburg Douglas is
in the former Soviet state to “take the pulse“ of democracy.  “It’s unfortunate we were prevented from holding the
meeting,” she said in the statement. “The denial of our
request, I hope, will draw greater attention to the deficiencies
in the rule of law and democracy in Ukraine.”  Tymoshenko was jailed for seven years in October for
exceeding her authority as prime minister in signing a natural-
gas delivery and transit agreement with  Russia  in 2009. She’s
“seriously ill,”  Der Spiegel  reported Feb. 22, citing a report
by doctors from Berlin’s Charité hospital who had examined her.  Two OSCE officials were denied a meeting with Tymoshenko
two weeks ago, the human rights and security organization, based
in Vienna, said today. The European Union has delayed signing an
association agreement with Ukraine that would include a free-
trade pact, citing Tymoshenko’s case.  To contact the reporters on this story:
