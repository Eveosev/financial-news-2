The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell 1.5 percent to 1,003 at its close in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)   dropped 2.4 percent to 3,630
koruna, snapping a four-day rally. Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) 
 also fell 2.4 percent. European stocks declined as
 China  lowered its economic-growth forecast and data showed that
euro-area manufacturing and services shrank more than estimated.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, slid 2 percent to 153.8 koruna, its third day of
declines. Commodities and mining stocks retreated as China, the
world’s second-largest economy, cut its growth target to the
slowest pace since 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
