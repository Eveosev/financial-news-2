European  retail sales  unexpectedly
rebounded from four months of declines in January, as growth in
 France  helped to offset a drop in Germany.  Sales rose 0.3 percent from December, when they fell a
revised 0.5 percent, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today. Economists had forecast a drop of 0.1
percent, the median of 20 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Sales (RSWAEMUY)  were unchanged from a year earlier.  European leaders are seeking way to bolster economic growth
and  job creation  after the region’s sovereign debt crisis forced
governments from Spain to Ireland to toughen budget cuts,
eroding consumer confidence. The European Commission last month
forecast the economy to shrink this year and unemployment in
January surged to the highest in more than a decade.  In  Germany , Europe’s largest economy, retail sales fell 1.6
percent from December, when they advanced 0.1 percent, today’s
report showed. Sales in France grew 2.1 percent after a 1.4
percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
