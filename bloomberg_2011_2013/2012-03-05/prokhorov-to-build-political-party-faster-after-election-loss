Russian billionaire  Mikhail
Prokhorov  pledged to speed up the formation of a middle-class
political party in Russia after coming third in the country’s
presidential elections.  “In the current political system, when the government is
de facto a Kremlin affiliate, I am not interested in working in
state bodies,” Prokhorov told state television Rossiya 24 last
night. “I have a different goal now, to build a new political
party.”  Prokhorov, whose fortune was valued at $18 billion by
Forbes last year, received about 7.8 percent of the votes in the
Russian presidential election yesterday, according to
preliminary data by the Central Election Commission. The
billionaire investor in Russian gold and aluminum producers came
in third after Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , who won almost 64
percent of the vote with more than 99 percent of ballots
counted, and Communist  Gennady Zyuganov .  To contact the reporters on this story:
