Turkey may annex  northern Cyprus  if
the divided Mediterranean island can’t resolve a four-decade
split through United Nations-led reunification talks, a
government official told the Turkish Cypriot Kibris newspaper.  “All options are on the table,” Turkey’s European Union
Affairs Minister  Egemen Bagis  told Kibris in an  interview  in
London. Turkey hopes for reunification under a federal system or
a two-state solution, Bagis said, adding that if those proposals
fail, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus may be attached to
Turkey, the only country that recognizes the breakaway state.  Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded the island in
1974 after a coup aimed at uniting it with Greece. The
internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government takes over
the rotating EU presidency in July.  Bagis told Kibris that  Turkey  won’t deal with a Cyprus-led
EU presidency. Cypriots are blocking negotiations, Bagis said,
adding that Turkey’s EU accession has been on hold for a year
and a half, according to Kibris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
