PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) , Poland’s largest
bank, said 2011 profit rose to a record, fueled by higher
lending as the country’s growth rate increased.  Net income at the Warsaw-based company advanced 18 percent
to 3.81 billion zloty ($1.22 billion) from 3.22 billion zloty a
year earlier, it said today in a regulatory statement. That’s in
line with the 3.82 billion-zloty mean  estimate  of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Net interest income, the difference between what the bank
pays on deposits and what it charges for loans, increased 17
percent to 7.61 billion zloty last year. Net fees and
commissions fell 1.3 percent to 3.1 million zloty. Lending
increased 9 percent to 147.3 billion zloty driven by  mortgage
loans . Polish economic growth was 4.3 percent in the fourth
quarter of last year.  The bank, which plans to recommend a 2011 dividend payout
in early May, may change its policy of paying out about 40
percent of profit to a range that would give it “more
flexibility,” Chief Executive Officer Zbigniew Jagiello told
reporters today, without giving any details. Puls Biznesu
newspaper reported today PKO may pay out from 20 percent to 60
percent of future earnings to shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
