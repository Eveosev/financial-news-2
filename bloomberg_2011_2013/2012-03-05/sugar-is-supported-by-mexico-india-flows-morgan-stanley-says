Slow sugar exports from  India , the
world’s second-largest producer, and “disappointing” Mexican
output are supporting prices, Morgan Stanley said.  Raw sugar has gained 6.9 percent in New York trading this
year. A drought in  Mexico  has reduced the crop to 5.1 million
metric tons from a previous forecast of 5.3 million tons, an
industry committee said Feb. 10. The pace of exports from India
has been slow, Morgan Stanley said. The country has so far
allowed 2 million tons of sugar shipments.  “With disappointing production in Mexico and Indian
exports slow to materialize, the large 2011-12 global production
surplus may take some time to translate into a market-pressuring
trade surplus,”  Hussein Allidina , head of commodities research
at the bank in  New York , said in a report e-mailed today.  Sugar supplies are set to outpace demand by 7.7 million
tons in the current 2011-12 season begun in October, the bank
said. Raw sweetener may average 22 cents a pound in the period
and 19 cents in 2012-13, according to Morgan Stanley. Raw sugar
for May delivery slipped 0.2 percent to 24.91 cents a pound by
9:18 a.m. London time on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  “With Northern Hemisphere supply increasing and some muted
optimism growing over new-crop Brazilian production, we remain
bearish on sugar through the balance of the year,” Allidina
said.  Morgan Stanley also is “bearish” on the outlook for
coffee prices, according to the report. The bank predicted
increased production in Brazil and  Vietnam , the two biggest
global growers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
