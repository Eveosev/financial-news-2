The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
retreated from a seven-month high as a strengthening yen clouded
the earnings outlook for exporters to Europe and falling oil
prices weighed on energy companies.  Shares also slipped after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said
mainland policy makers are targeting the slowest economic growth
this year since 2004.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest exporter of
consumer electronics, sank 3.3 percent.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the
country’s top energy explorer by market value, dropped 2.1
percent. JFE Holdings Inc. led steelmakers lower after a gauge
that tracks makers of the material jumped 19 percent last month.  “Japanese stocks have had a strong rally and technical
indicators suggest some overheating,” said Yumi Nishimura,
analyst at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. “Sectors that have been
performing strongly are slipping back a little, while investors
are buying defensive shares that have gained a little less.”  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.8 percent to 9,698.59 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , declining after the gauge rose last week to its
highest level since Aug. 2. The broader  Topix (TPX)  lost 0.6 percent
to 832.86 today. The 25-day Toraku, which tracks the ratio of
winners to losers on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, held for a 15th
day above 120, a level indicating to traders the market may fall.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.2 percent
today. The measure fell 0.3 percent in  New York  on March 2 amid
concern the U.S. economic outlook may not warrant the gauge’s
advance last week to its highest level since 2008.  ‘Insufficient Evidence’  Kyocera Corp. (6971)  and Nidec Corp. dropped after the U.S. Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board said the companies’ auditor
had issued reports without “sufficient competent evidential
matter.” Kyoto Audit Corp. failed to sufficiently test whether
sales figures were accurate or whether unsold products were
worth what the books said, according to the watchdog.  Kyocera, a Kyoto-based maker of mobile phones and
electronic equipment, fell 2.7 percent to 7,130 yen. Nidec, the
world’s biggest maker of motors for hard-disk drives, lost 2.3
percent to 7,350 yen.  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen 5.9 percent in the three weeks since
Feb. 14, when the Bank of  Japan  surprised investors by
increasing its bond purchases. The move helped drive the yen
down last week to its lowest against the dollar since May 25.  Exporters including Sony dropped after Japan’s currency
appreciated against all its major peers today, rising to as high
as 107.21 against the euro in Tokyo, compared with 108.32 at the
close of stock trading on March 2. A stronger yen erodes the
value of repatriated income for Japanese exporters.  Sony, Honda Drop  The European Union this week faces a test in its attempt to
turn the page on the two-year debt crisis when Greece’s private
creditors decide whether to sign off on the biggest sovereign-
debt restructuring in history.  Sony slumped 3.3 percent to 1,691 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  lost
1.3 percent to 3,050 yen. Shares of Japan’s third-largest
automaker have advanced 30 percent since Dec. 30 as the yen
weakened and U.S. car sales rose above 14 million units in
consecutive months for the first time since 2008.  Steelmakers and shipping lines declined the most among the
33 Topix  industry groups  today, retreating after gauges tracking
the sectors rose about 20 percent last month.  JFE, Japan’s second biggest steelmaker, slumped 3.8 percent
to 1,642 yen. Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s biggest shipping line,
fell 2.9 percent.  ‘Lock In Profits’  “Investors are looking to lock in profits,” said Koji
Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which
oversees the equivalent of $68 billion.  China  will target economic growth of 7.5 percent this year,
the lowest since 2004, cutting the 8 percent goal held from 2005
to 2011, Wen said in Beijing today. China is the world’s second-
largest economy and Japan’s top export market.  Energy companies fell as oil declined the most this year
after President Barack Obama asked Israel to refrain from
“loose talk of war” in confronting Iran’s nuclear program.
Obama and Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  meet today
at the White House to discuss stopping Iran’s nuclear program.  Inpex slid 2.1 percent to 561,000 yen. Smaller  Japan
Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662)  lost 1.5 percent to 3,870 yen.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Japanese  market  today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names.  Fast Retailing Co. (9983)  (9983 JT), Japan’s biggest clothing
seller, gained 1.4 percent to 17,080 yen after saying sales at
domestic stores open at least a year gained 1.2 percent in
February, rising for a third consecutive month.  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437)  (9437 JT), Japan’s biggest mobile phone
carrier, rose 1.6 percent to 141,500 yen. The company will form
a venture fund this year with Telefonica SA to develop its
smartphone-related technologies and services in  South America ,
the Nikkei newspaper reported. The fund size may be between 7
billion yen and 8 billion yen, it said.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  (7733 JT) retreated 5.5 percent to 1,256 yen.
The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor’s Office will arrest former
executives including ex-chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa for
misrepresentating the camera maker’s securities report, the
Mainichi newspaper reported, without saying where it obtained
the information.  Sanyo Housing Nagoya Co. (8904 JT), a home design company,
sank 5.7 percent to 73,400 yen. The company plans to raise as
much as 1.05 billion yen ($13 million) in a public share sale,
according to a filing with the  Finance Ministry .  Wakita & Co. (8125)  (8125 JO), a manufacturing and trading firm,
