Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (ALIBABZ)  plans to
send e-mails to a select group of banks this week inviting them
to participate in $3 billion of loans, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  Some of the proceeds will be used to help take the
borrower’s Hong Kong-listed unit,  Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688) , private, and
the invitation letters mark the beginning of the formal senior
syndication process, the person said, asking not to be
identified because the details are private.  Alibaba Group, run by billionaire Jack Ma, offered HK$13.50
($1.74) a share for the 27 percent it doesn’t already own in
Alibaba.com, according to a Feb. 21 regulatory filing to the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Ma is seeking to buy out minority
Alibaba.com shareholders four years after a $1.7 billion initial
public offering as the unit warned of slowing earnings growth
tied to a change in strategy.  John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman at Alibaba,
wasn’t immediately available to comment on the start of senior
syndication when contacted at his office today.  Alibaba Group signed the loan to finance the planned
Alibaba.com deal with arrangers  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Credit Suisse Group AG, DBS Bank Ltd., Deutsche Bank
AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., according
to last month’s filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
