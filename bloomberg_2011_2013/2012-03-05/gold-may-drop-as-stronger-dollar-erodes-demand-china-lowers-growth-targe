Gold declined for the second
straight session after  China  announced the lowest economic
growth target in seven years, curbing prospects for commodity
demand and global growth.  The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  dropped as much as 0.9
percent and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials
retreated as much as 0.7 percent after China cut the nation’s
economic growth target to 7.5 percent from an 8 percent goal in
place since 2005, according to Premier Wen Jiabao’s speech at
the National People’s Congress today.  “China’s statements have dampened  market sentiment 
today,”  Stephen Platt , an analyst at Archer Financial in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for April delivery fell 0.3 percent to settle
at $1,703.90 an ounce at 2:04 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Prices dropped 3.7 percent last week, the most since Dec. 16,
while the dollar gained 1.3 percent against a six-currency
basket.  “Gold still faces near-term hurdles such as bouts of
dollar strength, broad risk reduction and profit-taking,” Suki Cooper, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, wrote in a
report today. Still, “this is a healthy correction and, in our
view, the broader macro backdrop remains gold favorable, given
the negative interest-rate environment, longer-term inflationary
concerns and lingering sovereign debt uncertainties.”  Gold prices are in a 12th year of a bull run. Holdings in
bullion-backed  exchange-traded products  rose 1 metric ton to a
record 2,405.2 tons on March 2, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
 Hedge funds  and other money managers increased bets on higher
prices by 10 percent to 197,552 futures and options in the week
ended Feb. 28, the highest level since Sept. 6, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 2.4 percent to $33.695
an ounce. It’s the best-performing precious metal this year with
a gain of 21 percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery declined 1.7 percent to $1,662.60 an ounce. The
metal dropped 1.4 percent last week. Palladium futures for June
delivery decreased 0.8 percent to $706.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
