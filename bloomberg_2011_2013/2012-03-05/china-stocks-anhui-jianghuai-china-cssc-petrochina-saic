Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in China trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 15.69 points, or 0.6 percent, to
2,445. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 0.6 percent to 2,662.70.  Automakers:  SAIC Motor (600104)  Corp. (600104 CH), China’s largest
carmaker, fell 2.3 percent to 16 yuan.  Anhui Jianghuai
Automobile Co. (600418)  (600418 CH), a unit of China’s biggest light-
truck exporter, lost 2 percent to 7.74 yuan. Beiqi Foton Motor
Co. (600166 CH), the nation’s biggest commercial-vehicle maker,
dropped 2.1 percent to 7.32 yuan.  Deliveries of passenger autos, including sport-utility
vehicles and light-goods vans, in the first two months of 2012
fell 3 percent from a year earlier, based on the median estimate
of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the
biggest drop since 2005, when they fell 8.9 percent, according
to the  China Association of Automobile Manufacturers , which will
release industry data later this month.  China will control the increase in auto manufacturing
capacity and encourage mergers and reorganizations in the
industry, according to a work report delivered by Premier Wen Jiabao to the opening of the annual National People’s congress
today.  Defense-related stocks:  China North Optical-Electrical
Technology Co. (600435)  (600435 CH), which gets about 58 percent of its
revenue from military-dual use products, climbed 4.5 percent to
10.14 yuan.  China CSSC Holdings Ltd. (600150)  (600150 CH), a unit of the
nation’s biggest shipbuilder, jumped 5.4 percent to 33.18 yuan.  Military spending is set to rise 11.2 percent this year to
about 670 billion yuan ($106 billion),  Li Zhaoxing , a spokesman
for the NPC, said yesterday. China’s defense spending is the
second-highest in the world after the U.S.       PetroChina Co. (601857)  (601857 CH), the nation’s biggest oil
producer, retreated 1.1 percent to 10.47 yuan. Refining losses
were bigger than expected last year because  oil prices  rose,
Chairman Jiang Jiemin said in Beijing today.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
