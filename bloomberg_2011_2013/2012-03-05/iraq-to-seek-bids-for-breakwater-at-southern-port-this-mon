Iraq  will invite bids this month to
build a $341 million breakwater at the planned $6 billion Grand
Fao port in the south of the country, said Omran Radhi, director
general of the State Company for Iraq’s Ports.  Turkish, Chinese, Canadian, Spanish and Korean companies
have expressed interest in the project, Radhi said in a
telephone interview in Baghdad. He didn’t name the companies.  The Grand Fao port will have capacity for more than 30
ships and will provide at least 100,000 jobs, Radhi said.  Iraq holds the world’s fifth-largest crude deposits
including Canadian  oil sands , according to data from BP Plc. The
government is trying to attract foreign investment and expertise
to help rebuild the infrastructure and boost energy exports in
order to revive an economy shattered by years of conflict,
sanctions and sabotage.  To contact the reporters on this story:
