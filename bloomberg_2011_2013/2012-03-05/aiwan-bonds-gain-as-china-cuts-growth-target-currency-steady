Taiwan’s government bonds gained,
pushing  benchmark  10-year yields to an 11-week low, after  China 
cut its economic growth target. The island’s dollar dropped.  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said today the world’s second-
biggest economy is expected to expand 7.5 percent this year, the
lowest goal since 2004. The government sold NT$40 billion ($1.4
billion) of 10-year notes at 1.265 percent on March 3, less than
the 1.283 percent median estimate of fixed-income traders in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “The  bond market  has been pricing in slowing economic
growth prospects,” said  James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Yields continued to drop today after
the lower-than-expected auction yield.”  The rate on the government’s 1.25 percent notes due March
2022 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.259
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market showed. That’s the
lowest closing level for a benchmark 10-year bond since Dec. 19.  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.2 percent to NT$29.518 against
its U.S. counterpart from March 3 when the market was open to
make up for a holiday on Feb. 27, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.398 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
