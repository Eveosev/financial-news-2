Iran ’s alleged nuclear-weapons work
tops the agenda of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s
quarterly meeting of its 35-member board of governors today in
Vienna.  IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano will tell IAEA diplomats
about a two-day visit by inspectors to Tehran last month during
which they were barred from visiting the Parchin military
complex. Board members may criticize Iran’s lack of cooperation.  Today’s IAEA gathering comes before talks between President
Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu 
today. The two leaders are meeting in Washington, where they
will emphasize agreement over how to confront  Iran’s nuclear
program  as Obama asked Israel to help tone down “loose talk of
war.”  Iran, which is entering the ninth year of the IAEA probe,
has insisted that its nuclear program is peaceful. Supreme
Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  said on Feb. 23 that possession of
nuclear weapons is a “big crime.” The U.S. and its allies
suspect Iran may be trying to build an atomic bomb.  IAEA inspectors reported last month that Iran tripled
production of enriched uranium. Iran is now making almost 31
pounds (14 kilograms) of 20 percent-enriched uranium a month
compared with almost nine pounds in November, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
