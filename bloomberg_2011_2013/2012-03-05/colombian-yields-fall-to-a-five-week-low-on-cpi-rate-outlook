Colombian peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities to their lowest level in almost
six months, after investors reduced inflation forecasts and amid
speculation the central bank will raise  interest rates  at a
slower pace than analysts initially predicted.  Yields on the country’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 7.27 percent, according to the central bank. That’s
the lowest on a closing basis since Sept. 9. The price rose
0.276 centavo to 121.733 centavos per peso.  Annual inflation quickened to 3.74 percent in February from
3.54 percent the previous month, according to the median
estimate of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The central
bank targets inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent this
year. The national statistics agency is slated to release the
monthly inflation report at 7 p.m. Bogota time.  “Some are beginning to forecast inflation wasn’t as high
as initially thought,” said Daniel Lozano, an analyst at
Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota. “You also have what seems a
less hawkish central bank, which leads investors to price in
pauses” in the rate cycle, he said.  Policy makers increased the  overnight lending rate  25 basis
points to 5.25 percent on Feb. 24 in a decision that wasn’t
unanimous. Lozano said he’s sticking to his forecast that the
central bank will raise the key rate to 5.75 percent by year-
end.  Colombia ’s six-month interest-rate swaps, at 5.39 percent
today compared to 5.48 percent a week ago, show traders pricing
fewer interest-rate increases, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The swaps reflect traders’ views of the likely
average of future benchmark rates during the life of the
contract.  The peso erased an earlier decline, gaining 0.1 percent to
1,772.20 per  U.S. dollar , from 1,774 on March 2. The currency
has advanced 9.2 percent in the past three months, the best
performance among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
