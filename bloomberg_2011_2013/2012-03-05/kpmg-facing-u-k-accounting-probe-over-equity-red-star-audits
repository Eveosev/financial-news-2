Britain’s accounting regulator
will investigate  KPMG  Audit Plc over its accounting for
Equity Red Star, one of the U.K.’s largest motor insurance
companies and a syndicate of Lloyd’s of London.  The probe will cover KPMG’s audit of Equity Red Star Motor
Syndicate 218, which trades as Equity Red Star, for 2007, 2008
and 2009 and will focus on “technical provisions,” according
to a statement today from the  Accountancy and Actuarial
Discipline Board , part of the London-based  Financial Reporting
Council .  “KMPG will cooperate fully with the AADB’s investigation
and is confident that its audit work in relation to the Equity
Red Star syndicate met the relevant professional standards,”
Gavin Houlgate, a KPMG spokesman, said in a phone interview.  Equity Syndicate Management Ltd., which is owned by
Insurance Australia Group Ltd., is the managing agent for the
syndicate, said Anna Colban, spokeswoman for the AADB.
Disciplinary complaints filed after AADB investigations are
heard by independent tribunals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
