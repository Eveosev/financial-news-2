The  Boston  Celtics’ overtime win
over the  New York Knicks  and the Los Angeles Lakers’ victory
over the Miami Heat combined to give ABC a 27 percent ratings
boost over an equivalent basketball doubleheader last year.  Yesterday afternoon’s game at TD Garden in Boston, a 115-
111 loss for the Knicks that marked Harvard University graduate
Jeremy Lin’s return to the Boston area for the first time
becoming a New York starter, was seen in an average of 4.3
percent of U.S. homes in the top 56 television markets,
according to Josh Krulewitz, a spokesman for  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s
ESPN, which oversees ABC Sports. The Lakers, led by Kobe Bryant,
followed with a 93-83 win over the  Miami Heat , earning a 5.2
major-market rating.  Last season’s equivalent matchups were a Chicago Bulls-Heat
game and a Lakers-San Antonio Spurs meeting, Krulewitz said in
an e-mail.  The Celtics’ Rajon Rondo topped Lin with 18 points, 20
assists and a career-high 17 rebounds, becoming the only player
other than Hall of Fame members Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson to record at least 15 points, 20 assists and 15
rebounds in a game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  Lin, who has helped lead the Knicks into playoff contention
after an 8-15 start, had 14 points, five assists and six
turnovers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
