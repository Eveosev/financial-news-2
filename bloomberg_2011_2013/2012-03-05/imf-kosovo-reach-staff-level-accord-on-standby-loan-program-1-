The  International Monetary Fund 
reached a staff-level accord with the Kosovar government on a
107 million-euro ($141.3 million) standby loan agreement, the
Washington-based lender said.  The IMF board may decide on the agreement at the end of
April, it said today in an e-mailed statement, 10 months after
discontinuing a program over an excessive wage bill that the
government adopted with the 2011 budget.  Kosovo ended last year with full-year economic growth of 5
percent and a fiscal gap amounting to 1.8 percent of gross
domestic product, less than the 2.9 percent limit outlined in
the program.  Fiscal policy will remain the focus of the new 20-month
program, with the lender pointing to further fiscal
consolidation “aiming at a sustainable budgetary stance in two
years” as the key, Authorities should consider introducing a
“legally binding fiscal rule” in the longer run to ensure
stability, it said.  The IMF sees economic growth in the former Serbian province
at 3.8 percent this year, or 0.2 percentage points below last
November’s estimate of 4 percent growth.  The forecast reflects concern about “a possible
deterioration in labor market conditions in central European
countries where most of the Kosovar diaspora lives,” which may
“negatively affect” foreign direct investment and remittances,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
