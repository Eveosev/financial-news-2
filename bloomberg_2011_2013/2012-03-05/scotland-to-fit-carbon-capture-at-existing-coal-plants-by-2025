The Scottish government plans to fit
 carbon capture  and storage at all coal plants by 2025 and said
demonstrating the technology could generate 3.5 billion pounds
($5.6 billion) in the next decade.  The government plans to complete a review by 2018, “with
the likelihood of having existing plants retro-fitted by no
later than 2025,” it said today in a draft document on power
generation plans.  All coal plant applications must demonstrate CCS on at
least 300 megawatts of capacity, and from 2020, they will
require CCS for all their capacity, according to the document
sent by e-mail today.  CCS technology sequesters emissions from fossil fuels,
allowing coal plants to keep delivering a baseload of
electricity without releasing pollution as  Scotland  transitions
to renewable energy sources, according to the document. The
nation plans to get 100 percent of its electricity from
technologies including wind, wave and biomass by 2020.  “This predominant role for renewable energy in electricity
supply in Scotland by 2020 will be supported by a minimum of 2.5
gigawatts of thermal generation progressively fitted with carbon
capture and storage,” according to the document.  Successful demonstration of CCS technology in Scotland
could create as many as 5,000 jobs over the decade, the
government said in the document.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
