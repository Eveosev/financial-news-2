X5 Retail Group (FIVE) ,  Russia ’s largest
food retailer by sales, fell to the lowest in more than two
weeks as the director of its discount format division quit after
15 years with the company.  The shares slid 5.2 percent to $25.05 at 12 p.m. in London
trading, the weakest intraday level since Feb. 16. Oleg Vysotsky
will continue to manage the division until a replacement is
found and will then serve as a transition adviser, X5 said in a
statement today.  “Mr. Vysotsky was one of X5’s star managers, who has
helped to make discounters the company’s best-performing
business,” said  Luis Saenz , chief executive officer of the U.S.
unit of Moscow-based brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp. in an e-
mailed note today. “His departure is likely to weaken X5’s core
segment.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
