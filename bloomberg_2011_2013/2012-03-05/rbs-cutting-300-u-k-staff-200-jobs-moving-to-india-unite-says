Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s largest government-controlled lender, said it was
cutting 215 U.K. jobs and moving the posts overseas.  The cuts will fall on support staff at the bank’s finance
division, mainly in Edinburgh and  London , a spokesman said. The
reductions are in addition to the 6,800 job losses announced
since August. About 250 posts will be created overseas, the
lender said.  “As we work to rebuild RBS we continue to streamline our
business,” the Edinburgh-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement. “The movement of roles between countries reflects
the global nature of our business and the need to locate our
people close to the customers they serve.”  RBS’s Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester , 51, who has
said his job is equivalent to defusing the “biggest time bomb
in history,” has shrunk the bank’s assets by more than 700
billion pounds and cut more than 35,000 jobs since he took over
from  Fred Goodwin  in 2008.  “Instead of sending financial services work from the UK to
a low-wage economy, RBS should be ensuring their workforce is
able to get on with the work they do,” said Unite national
officer  David Fleming .  To contact the reporters on this story:
