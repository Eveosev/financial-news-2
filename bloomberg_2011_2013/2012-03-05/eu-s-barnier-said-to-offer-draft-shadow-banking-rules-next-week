European Union regulators, concerned
about attempts to evade a clamp-down on excessive risk taking,
will weigh tougher rules for money market funds and other so-
called shadow banks, according to an EU official familiar with
the proposal.  Michel Barnier , the region’s financial services chief, will
publish draft plans for regulating shadow banks next week and
may seek to have new rules in place by the start of 2013,
according to the official who declined to be identified because
the talks are private.  Options being considered by the EU include extending
 capital requirements  for lenders and insurers to shadow banks,
or forcing them to comply with oversight rules that were
originally intended for  hedge funds , the person said.  The Group of 20 nations has urged regulators to rein in
lenders that minimize the amount of capital they need to hold by
using shadow banks to shift risks off their balance sheets. In
addition to  money market funds , the EU measures may target
securitizations, repurchase agreements and exchange-traded
funds, according to the  EU’s website .  The Financial Stability Board, which brings together
regulators, central bankers and finance ministry officials from
G-20 nations, said last year that “bank-sponsored shadow
banking entities” may create “an opportunity for regulatory
arbitrage.”  Barnier will seek views on the proposals, which are set to
be adopted on March 13, before deciding how to proceed,
according to the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
