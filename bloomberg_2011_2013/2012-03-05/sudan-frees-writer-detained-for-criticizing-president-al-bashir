Sudanese writer and academic Mohamed
Zein el-Abbeddin, who was arrested on Feb. 20 for an article he
wrote that criticized President Umar al-Bashir, was released
yesterday, his lawyer, Nabil Adib, said.  El-Abbeddin is the dean of the College of Higher Education
at the Al Zaiem Al Azhari University in Khartoum. His article,
published in the Khartoum-based al-Tayar newspaper, criticized
al-Bashir, the security forces and companies owned by the ruling
 National Congress Party .  The authorities seized copies of the al-Tayar newspaper
edition that carried el-Abbeddinâ€™s article and suspended
publication of the newspaper two days later. The ban was lifted
yesterday, Adib said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
