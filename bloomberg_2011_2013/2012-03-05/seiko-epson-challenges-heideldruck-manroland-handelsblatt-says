Seiko Epson  seeks to conquer the
printing industry, Handelsblatt reported, citing an interview
with Minoru Usui, the company’s president.  Seiko Epson wants to replace conventional with digital
printing, challenging companies like  Heidelberger Druckmaschinen
AG (HDD) ,  Koenig & Bauer AG (SKB)  and Manroland AG, the newspaper said in a
preview of an article for tomorrow’s edition.  Only 10 percent of worldwide 413 billion euro ($546
billion) industrial printing volume is done with digital
machinery, which still operates less efficiently than
conventional printers, according to Handelsblatt.  Seiko Epson, known mainly for its printers for individual
use, devotes 6 percent of its yearly sales to research for
improving digital printing technology, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
