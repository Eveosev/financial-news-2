Carlyle Group  is seeking a $510
million collateralized loan obligation to be arranged by  Wells
Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., according
to three people with knowledge of the deal.  The CLO may include a $320 million slice rated AAA by
Standard & Poorâ€™s, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  To contact the reporters on this story:
