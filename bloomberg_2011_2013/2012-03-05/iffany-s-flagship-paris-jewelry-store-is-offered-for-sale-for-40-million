Tiffany & Co. (TIF) ’s flagship Paris store
in the city’s fashion district was put on the market for more
than 30 million euros ($40 million), according to CBRE Group
Inc., the broker handling the sale.  The property at 6 rue de la Paix near Place Vendome has 770
square meters (8,288 square feet) of space used by Tiffany, the
world’s second-largest luxury jeweler, and closely held Austrian
retailer Kornmesser, CBRE said in a statement today. Both
tenants have long-term leases, CBRE said without identifying the
building’s owner.  Tiffany, based in New York, plans to renovate the Paris
outlet next year, Agnes Cromback, head of the company’s French
unit, said in a September interview.  “Prime retail properties of this quality and with this
strength of tenant are rare,”  Larry Young , an associate
director at CBRE, said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
