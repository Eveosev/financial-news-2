Ernst & Young LLP, one of the so-
called Big Four accounting firms, said it won bids to audit
public services in the east and south of  England  as the U.K.’s
government watchdog shifts work to private companies.  The firm picked up one-fifth of the available contracts,
London-based Ernst & Young said in a statement. Employees from
the Audit Commission, the agency that monitors local services,
will transfer to Ernst & Young in October to begin work on
2012-13 audits, according to the statement.  “Public bodies face an unprecedented time in the next five
years in balancing expenditure reduction while maintaining vital
services and increasing expectations for better and more
tailored services,” Bjorn Conway, head of Ernst & Young’s
government and public sector practice, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
