China , the world’s fastest-growing
major economy, plans to cut energy use per unit of gross
domestic unit by 3.5 percent this year after missing the same
target in 2011.  The government also wants to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions by at least 3.5 percent and sulfur dioxide emissions
by 2 percent, according to a report today by the  National
Development and Reform Commission , China’s top economic planner.  The government’s attempt to meet last year’s energy-
conservation goal by shutting inefficient factories failed as
energy use rose at the fastest pace in four years. Consumption
per unit of gross domestic product fell 2.01 percent in 2011,
the  National Bureau (NBSZ)  of Statistics Bureau said last month.  China’s power generation will rise 7.5 percent to 5.05
trillion kilowatt-hours this year, according to the report in
Beijing at the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress.
Coal production will climb 3.7 percent to 3.65 billion metric
tons, while crude-oil output will be unchanged at 204 million
tons, it said.  Electricity generation increased 11.7 percent last year,
while coal output rose 8.7 percent and crude production advanced
0.3 percent. China cut its economic growth target to 7.5 percent
for this year after aiming for 8 percent every year since 2005,
according to a speech at the NPC meeting today by Premier  Wen
Jiabao .  To contact the reporters on this story:
