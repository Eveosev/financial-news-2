Pacific Century Premium
Developments Ltd. (432) , the property unit of billionaire Richard Li’s  PCCW Ltd. (8) , rose by the most in about three years in  Hong
Kong  after saying it plans to buy back shares at a premium.  The  stock  resumed trading today, after being suspended on
Jan. 31. The shares climbed 28 percent, the biggest intraday
increase since April 2009, to HK$1.81 as of 2:51 p.m. trading
break. The Hong Kong-based company plans to repurchase as much
as 38 percent of its shares at HK$1.85, 35 percent more than
the close on Jan. 30, Pacific Century said in a statement.  Pacific Century, 62 percent held by PCCW and 23 percent
by Elliott Capital Advisors, L.P., plans to  restore  the
proportion of publicly traded shares with the buyback offer to
the limit required by the exchange, according to the
statement. The total cost of the repurchase will be HK$1.71
billion ($220 million) and will be paid out of the company’s
own resources, it said.  “The liquidity of the shares has been impaired by the
concentration in the hands of the Elliott entities,” Hong
Kong-based Pacific Century said. This “has partly contributed
to the limited investor interest in the shares.”  Pacific Century said it plans to offer as many as four
bonus shares for each existing share held after the buyback is
completed, and may take other steps to insure the restoration
of the 25 percent public holding. Shareholders will have the
option of accepting convertible notes instead of new shares.  Hong Kong’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 1.3 percent as
of 2:51 p.m..  To contact the reporter on this story:
