Milwaukee Brewers  right fielder
Corey Hart will have surgery this week to repair a torn meniscus
in his right knee and may miss the start of  Major League
Baseball ’s regular season.  The Brewers said Hart, 29, will probably miss three to four
weeks following the surgery. Milwaukee opens the regular season
on April 6 against the  St. Louis Cardinals .  “I don’t want to rush him back if this is not something
smart to do with this type of surgery,” Brewers manager Ron Roenicke said on the  team’s website .  A strained rib cage forced Hart to miss the start of last
season, when he hit .285 with 26 home runs and 63 runs batted in
over 130 games for the Brewers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
