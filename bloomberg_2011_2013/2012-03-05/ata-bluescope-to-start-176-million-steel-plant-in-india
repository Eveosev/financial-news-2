Tata BlueScope Steel , an equal
venture between biggest steelmakers in  India  and  Australia , will
start an 8.8 billion rupee ($176 million) coated steel plant in
the South Asian nation to tap local demand.  The plant, to be located in the eastern city of Jamshedpur,
will have an annual capacity of 250,000 metric tons, Harish
Pathak, managing director of the venture, said today in an e-
mailed response to questions. The metallic coated products will
be used in pre-fabricated buildings.  India’s steel ministry in November estimated the country’s
demand may grow at 9 percent per annum in the next five years,
benefitting local producers. Tata Steel Ltd., Steel Authority of
India Ltd., and JSW Steel Ltd., the nation’s top producers, are
raising the output of high-value steel products to improve
profit margins and reduce the impact of increasing raw material
prices.  Tata Steel (TATA)  is also building a 3.2 million ton blast furnace
at Jamshedpur, where it operates its biggest and only factory in
the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
