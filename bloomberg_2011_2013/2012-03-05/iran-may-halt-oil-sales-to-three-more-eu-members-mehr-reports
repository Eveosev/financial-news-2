Iran  will probably stop sales of
crude to Belgium, the  Czech Republic  and the Netherlands, the
state-run Mehr news agency reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  The final decision on halting sales to the three European
Union countries will be made soon by the Iranian oil ministry,
Mehr said.  Those countries havenâ€™t accepted conditions outlined by
Iran including a three-to-five year purchase contract, a
guarantee on payments for purchased oil and removing any
preconditions from purchase contracts, Mehr reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
