Gagfah SA (GFJ) , the biggest residential
landlord in  Germany , climbed the most since 2006 in Frankfurt
trading after settling a sales dispute with the city of Dresden
that prompted two lawsuits.  Gagfah rose 27 percent to 5.54 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close. The Luxembourg-based company agreed to pay Dresden 36
million euros ($47 million) through 2020 relating to Gagfah’s
WOBA Dresden unit. The accord will make it easier for Gagfah to
refinance its debt, Commerzbank AG analyst Thomas Rothaeusler
said in a note to investors today.  “We see at least a chance for a partial refinancing or
extension of major loans, which would also be a positive
trigger,” Rothaeusler said. The Frankfurt-based analyst raised
his rating on the stock to “buy” from “hold” after the
announcement, which was made after the market closed on Friday.  Most of Gagfah’s debt is due to be refinanced in 2013.
Dresden sued the company for 1.08 billion euros in April,
claiming it broke a sales agreement. Gagfah filed a countersuit
over the claim in June.  Gagfah has climbed 44 percent in the past six months, while
the  DAX Mid-Cap Index (MDAX)  has added 23 percent. The company has a
market value of about 1.23 billion euros.  Dresden’s city council will vote on the agreement at a
meeting on March 15.  Gagfah owns about 155,000 apartments across Germany,
according to its website.  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)  acquired
the WOBA unit in 2006 for 1.75 billion euros and transferred the
company to Gagfah, its holding company at the time that later
sold shares to the public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
