second-biggest producer of the building material by market
value, advanced 2.9 percent to close at 41 naira, the biggest
daily gain since Jan. 20, on speculation it will pay a higher
dividend.  “Investors are expecting a higher dividend from the
company for 2011,” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of
Kundila Finance, a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone today.
Lafarge Wapco paid a dividend of 25 kobo per share for the prior
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that amount
was constrained because of investment in an expansion project,
“this year, it has no excuse to not pay a higher dividend
having completed the project,” he said.  Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM)  , East Africa’s biggest mobile-
phone operator, jumped 5 percent to 3.2 shillings, the largest
advance since Sept. 7, on speculation lower rates for money
transfer will boost usage.  The company cut the charge to send 101 shillings ($1.22) to
500 shillings over its M-Pesa mobile phone money-transfer
service to 25 shillings, from 30 shillings, Nairobi-based
Business Daily said March 2. Transfers of 10 shillings to 50
shillings will cost 3 shillings, while previously users were
unable to send any amount less than 50 shillings, it said.  Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. (UCSP)  , Kenya’s only publicly
traded retail chain, surged 4.1 percent to 7.6 shillings.
Kestrel Capital (East Africa) Ltd., a Nairobi-based brokerage,
said it initiated coverage on Uchumi with a “buy”
recommendation and a price estimate of 15 shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
