Socialist Francois Hollande widened
his lead over French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  to 18 percentage
points from last week, according to a BVA poll.  They survey, to be published in tomorrow’s Le Parisien,
showed Hollande with a lead of 59 percent to 41 percent in a
head-to-head match. Last month, the gap was 58 percent to 42
percent. In a multi-candidate race, Hollande’s lead remained at
eight points, 33 percent to 25 percent. The pollster questioned
963 people and no margin of error was published.  The first round of voting in the French presidential
election is April 22 with a run-off May 6.  In a poll published earlier today, a majority of voters
said they didn’t want either of the leading candidates. Fifty-
two percent of the French don’t want Hollande as president, said
a Viavoice poll for Liberation newspaper. Two-thirds disliked
Sarkozy.  Viavoice interviewed 1,001 voters by telephone March 1-2.
The margin of error is as much as 3.1 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
