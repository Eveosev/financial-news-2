Morocco  may be required to boost
grain imports this year on rising demand and as the country
faces a dry agricultural season, newspaper Le Matin  reported ,
without saying where it got the information.  Grain imports from the start of June to the end of January
were more than 3 million metric tons, of which 45 percent was
soft wheat and 39 percent was corn, the Casablanca-based
newspaper wrote, citing data from Moroccoâ€™s state grain buyer
Office National Interprofessionnel des Cereales et des
Legumineuses.  Morocco has soft-wheat stocks of more than 1.5 million
tons, enough to cover close to four months of demand from the
milling industry, according to Le Matin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
