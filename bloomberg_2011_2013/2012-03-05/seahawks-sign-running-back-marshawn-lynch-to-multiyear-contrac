Running back Marshawn Lynch signed a
multiyear contract with the  Seattle Seahawks  after rushing for a
career-high 1,204 yards and 13 touchdowns last season.  The Seahawks didn’t disclose terms of Lynch’s contract. The
four-year deal is worth $31 million, including $18 million
guaranteed, the  Associated Press reported , citing an
unidentified person with knowledge of the agreement. Lynch would
have become an unrestricted free agent on March 13.  “We are excited to keep Marshawn as an important part of
what we are building,” Seahawks General Manager John Schneider
said on the  team’s website . “This is what we were hoping for
when we acquired him from Buffalo.”  Lynch, 25, joined the Seahawks in an Oct. 5, 2010 trade
with the Bills and rushed for 573 yards and six touchdowns that
season. Last year, he became  Seattle ’s first 1,000-yard rusher
since Shaun Alexander in 2005, helping the Seahawks finish 7-9
after a 2-6 start to the National Football League season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
