Greek economic sentiment was
unchanged in February as new austerity measures agreed to in
exchange for a second bailout package threatened to deepen the
country’s recession.  An index measuring short-term economic trends stood at 74.9
for a second month, down from 75.7 in December, the Athens-based
 Foundation for Economic & Industrial Research , known as IOBE,
said in an e-mailed report today.  Consumer confidence  dropped
3.4 points to minus 83.5, the foundation said.  Greece’s government last month committed to additional
austerity measures and negotiated terms for the biggest debt
restructuring in history to secure a 130 billion-euro ($172
billion) aid package from the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund .  “Uncertainty over the country’s economic course remains as
the Greek economy’s loan program is connected to structural
reforms which will, at least in the short-term, intensify the
recession and unemployment,” IOBE said. “However, lifting the
currency danger, recapitalization of banks and the gradual
improvement of the country’s image abroad” are expected to lead
to an improvement in sentiment, according to IOBE.  Greece ’s economy is set to shrink for a fifth year in 2012
after a 6.8 percent contraction last year. Unemployment jumped
to 21 percent in November, according to the Hellenic Statistical
Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
