Corn, trading little changed, may
advance after  South Korea  bought U.S. grain, boosting
speculation that its discount to wheat may encourage further
purchases. Wheat and soybeans declined.  May-delivery corn was at $6.5425 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade at 3:40 p.m. Singapore time, after slipping as
much as 0.3 percent. The grain was 19 cents  cheaper  than wheat,
trading at a discount for a sixth day.  Nonghyup Feed Inc., South Korea’s biggest buyer of feed
grains, purchased 126,000 metric tons of U.S. corn in a tender
on March 2 for delivery in July, Lee Tae Woong, deputy general
manager at the foreign trade department, said today.  “Cheaper corn could encourage more buyers to buy,”  Tetsu
Emori , a commodity fund manager at Astmax Co. Ltd. said by phone
from  Tokyo  today. “It’s quite attractive now against wheat.”  Nonghyup also purchased 55,000 tons of South American
soybean meal for July delivery in a separate tender, Na Su Min,
another deputy general manager at the foreign trade department,
said today.  Corn output in Argentina and Brazil may exceed last month’s
estimate by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture , according to
Informa Economics Inc. Argentina may harvest 22.5 million tons
this year, compared with the USDA estimate of 22 million tons,
Informa said March 2. Brazil’s crop may be 61.5 million tons,
bigger than the USDA’s 61 million tons, Informa said.  “Weighing on corn prices was Informa’s Argentine corn crop
forecast,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth
Bank of Australia (CBA) , said in a report e-mailed today. Argentina is
the second-largest shipper after the U.S., USDA data show.  Soybeans for May delivery fell 0.4 percent to $13.275 a
bushel, ending a 10-day rally, the longest winning streak since
July 15. Wheat for May delivery declined 0.2 percent to $6.7325
a bushel, after climbing 5.2 percent last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
