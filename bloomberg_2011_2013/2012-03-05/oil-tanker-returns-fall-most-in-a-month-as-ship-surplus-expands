Returns for the largest  oil tankers 
hauling Middle East crude to  Asia  fell the most in a month as a
surplus of ships expanded and fuel costs rose.  Daily income for very large crude carriers on the benchmark
Saudi Arabia-to-Japan voyage plunged 14 percent to $11,949,
according to the London-based  Baltic Exchange . That was the
biggest drop since Feb. 1, its figures showed. Each of the ships
can transport 2 million barrels.  The supply of vessels available to load in the  Persian Gulf 
over the next four weeks increased by one to 85 ships, said
Kevin Sy, a Singapore-based freight-derivatives broker at Marex
Spectron Group. The price of ship fuel, or bunkers, was near the
highest level since at least October 2008, according to figures
compiled by Bloomberg from 25 global ports.  “There are more than enough ships available,” Sy said in
an e-mailed report.  Fuel prices climbed 1 percent to $730.45 a metric ton, the
data showed. They reached $731.10 on Feb. 28.  Owners can curb fuel costs, boosting returns, by reducing a
ship’s pace on a return journey after unloading of cargo. Bunker
prices have gained 11 percent since the start of the year, the
Bloomberg data show.  Hire costs  for VLCCs on the benchmark route fell 0.3
percent to 52.35 industry-standard Worldscale points, according
to the exchange.  The points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or flat
rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually
by the Worldscale Association in  London  to reflect changing fuel
costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a broader measure of oil-
shipping costs that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs,
increased 0.8 percent to 796.  To contact the reporter on this story:
