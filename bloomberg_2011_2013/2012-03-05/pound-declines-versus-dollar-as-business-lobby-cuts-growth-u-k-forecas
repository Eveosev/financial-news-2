U.K gilts fell, extending last
week’s drop, as U.S. data showed growth in non-manufacturing
orders in February, renewing speculation the economic recovery
is taking hold and damping demand for safer assets.  The pound slid for the first time in five days versus the
yen after the British Chambers of Commerce cut its U.K. growth
forecast and predicted the Bank of England would refrain from
more asset-purchases. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s
index of non-manufacturing industries, which account for almost
90 percent of the  U.S. economy , rose to 57.3 from 56.8 a month
earlier. The Tempe, Arizona-based group’s measure was projected
to fall to 56, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Gilts have fallen “pretty much in line with other major
markets after U.S. economic data was a bit better than
expected,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Investec Bank
Plc in London. “Stronger U.S. growth reduces downside economic
risk and thus the need for exceptionally easy monetary policy
although I think tightening is a very long time away still, both
in the U.K. and elsewhere.”  The 10-year gilt yield rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.18 percent at 4:15 p.m.  London  time after
rising seven basis points last week. The 4 percent security due
March 2022 fell 0.365, or 3.65 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 116.330. Two-year gilt yields were four basis points
higher at 0.43 percent.  Benchmark U.S. Treasury note yields and rose two basis
points to 1.99 percent. German 10-year bund rates also gained
two basis points, to 1.83 percent.  Sterling depreciated 0.3 percent to 129.13 yen and was 0.1
percent stronger at $1.5856 after earlier falling 0.3 percent to
$1.5786, the lowest since Feb. 24. The pound was little changed
at 83.37 pence per euro.  QE Target  The London-based business lobby lowered its 2012 growth
projection to 0.6 percent from 0.8 percent in December. It
pushed back its forecast for an interest-rate rise to the end of
2013 from the first quarter.  The  Bank of England ’s Monetary Policy Committee will keep
its bond-buying target at 325 billion pounds when it meets on
March 8, according to all the 45 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Demand for the pound was also limited as a U.K. services
index fell from an 11-month high in February. The gauge based on
a survey by  Markit Economics  and the  Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply  was 53.8 last month, from 56 in January,
the highest since March 2011. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News Survey of 29 analysts was 55.  Pound May Slip  The pound may slip to $1.5751 after falling through its
200-day moving average of $1.5893 and Feb. 28 low of $1.5902,
 Axel Rudolph , a senior technical analyst at Commerzbank AG in
London wrote in a note to clients.  The $1.5751 level is the two-month support line, derived
from connecting the January and February lows, he said.  Support refers to an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate buy orders are clustered. A moving average is the
average value of a security over a period of time.  Gilts have handed investors a 0.9 percent loss this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  U.S. Treasuries 
dropped 0.2 percent and German bunds returned 0.3 percent.  Sterling has weakened 0.6 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar fell 2.8 percent and the
euro declined 0.7 percent.  -- Editors: Mark McCord, Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporter on this story:
