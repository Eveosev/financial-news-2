Hungary ’s benchmark BUX stock index
dropped 1.6 percent to 19,005.86 at the close in Budapest.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, fell the
most since Feb. 16 after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s spokesman
said European Union finance ministers will approve a proposal to
cut Hungary’s development subsidies for exceeding the bloc’s
deficit limits. The shares slid 2.3 percent to 3,941 forint.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s biggest refiner, weakened 0.7
percent to 18,760 forint. Oil declined , extending last week’s
loss amid concern that consumption will slow in  China  after the
country lowered its growth goal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
