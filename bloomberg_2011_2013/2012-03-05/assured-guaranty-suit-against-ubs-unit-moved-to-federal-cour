Assured Guaranty Ltd.’s (AGO)  lawsuit
against a  UBS AG (UBSN)  unit accusing the company of failing to meet
obligations related to the pooling of residential mortgage-
backed securities was moved to federal court.  The lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan on Feb. 2, was moved to U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York, according to documents filed
today in state court.  Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp., a New York-based unit of
the Hamilton, Bermuda-based insurer, accused Wilmington,
Delaware-based  UBS (UBS)  Real Estate Securities Inc. of failing to
abide by obligations under pooling and servicing agreements
related to residential mortgage-backed securities sold in three
offerings in 2006 and 2007.  UBS said Assured Guaranty is a “sophisticated market
participant” and understood the risks it was taking when it
agreed to insure about $1.5 billion in securities backed by
“high-risk mortgages.”  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  The case is Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. v. UBS Real
Estate Securities Inc., 650327/2012,  New York  State Supreme
Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
