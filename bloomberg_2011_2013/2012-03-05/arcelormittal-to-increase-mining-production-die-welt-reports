ArcelorMittal (MT)  plans to increase
mining to become less dependent on suppliers such as  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) , Die Welt said.  The company, which produced 54.1 million metric tons ore
and 8 million metric tons coals last year, has placed a top
priority on securing resources, the newspaper said, citing an
interview with Frank Schulz, head of ArcelorMittalâ€™s German
unit.  ArcelorMittal already produces 42 percent of the iron ore
it uses and aims to increase that to 77 percent by 2015 by using
deposits in Canada and Liberia, Die Welt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
