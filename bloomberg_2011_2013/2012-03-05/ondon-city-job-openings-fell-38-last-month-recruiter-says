Job vacancies at  London ’s financial-
services companies fell 38 percent last month as the euro
region’s sovereign debt crisis hampered confidence, recruitment
firm  Astbury Marsden  said.  New vacancies in the British capital’s City and Canary
Wharf financial districts fell to 3,585 last month from 5,800 a
year ago, the recruiter said in a statement today.  “Although the City is still facing very tough trading
conditions, there are now clear signs that the jobs market is
stabilizing after a turbulent few months,”  Mark Cameron , chief
operating officer at Astbury Marsden, said in the statement.
“It is difficult to overestimate how big an effect the eurozone
crises had on sentiment in the banking sector.”  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Britain’s largest
government-owned lender, announced cuts of 4,800 jobs in
January, blaming volatile markets and increasing U.K.
regulation.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Britain’s biggest bank, said last
year that it’s removing 30,000 positions.  “January prompted an unexpected rise in City job vacancies
as a result of pent-up demand for City staff from the latter
stages of 2011,” Cameron said. “February has been more
subdued, but with fears of a double dip receding, we have
started to see more consistent demand over the last couple of
weeks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
