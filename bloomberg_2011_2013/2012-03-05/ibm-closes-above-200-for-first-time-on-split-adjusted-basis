International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  closed above $200 for the first time, driven higher as
technology companies seize leadership in the U.S. stock market
as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rally enters its fourth year.  IBM rose 0.9 percent today, crossing a level never before
seen when stock splits are factored in. The Armonk, New York-
based company has advanced 9.1 percent in 2012, and 140 percent
since the bull market for U.S. equities began on March 9, 2009.
Computer-related stocks in the  S&P 500  have climbed 15 percent
since the end of December, the most among 10 industries.  The world’s largest computer-services provider posted a
third straight annual gain in 2011 as the  S&P 500 (SPX)  stalled after
surging 39 percent in 2009 and 2010. The shares have increased
3.8 percent since Feb. 21, when their price-earnings ratio
dropped to the lowest level since June versus the valuation for
S&P 500 technology companies,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Virginia “Ginni” Rometty succeeded Sam Palmisano this
year, becoming the first female chief executive officer in the
company’s 100-year history. She inherits a five-year plan that
includes boosting software to half of IBM’s earnings, with a
focus on programs that help businesses analyze and project
trends, as well as on cloud computing and  emerging markets .  In January, IBM reported  revenue  of $107 billion for 2011
and earnings of $13.06 a share, and forecast 2012 earnings that
exceeded analysts’ estimates.  IBM has the biggest weight in the 30-company  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , accounting for 12 percent of its value. The
Dow slipped 14.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,962.81 today,
while the S&P 500 lost 0.4 percent to 1,364.33.  IBM’s advance came as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  sank below a milestone
reached last week. The stock dropped 2.2 percent to $533.16
today, sending Apple’s market capitalization below $500 billion.
The maker of iPhones and iPad tablet computers became only the
sixth U.S. company to climb above that threshold, according to
data compiled by S&P. The others are Microsoft Corp., General
Electric Co., Cisco Systems Inc.,  Intel Corp . and Exxon Mobil
Corp., in chronological order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
