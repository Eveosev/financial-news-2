Australian help-wanted notices
advanced in February for a second straight month, driven by a
mining investment boom to meet Asian demand, a private report
showed.  Jobs advertised  in newspapers and on the Internet rose 3.3
percent last month, after a revised 7.5 percent gain in January,
according to an  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) 
report released in Melbourne today.  Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens will keep the nation’s
benchmark interest rate at 4.25 percent tomorrow, according to
all 24 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Resource projects
in Australia valued at A$456 billion ($490 billion), fueled by
companies such as  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , are helping cushion a slump
in manufacturing and services hurt by a strong currency.  “The data supports the view that mining, energy and
infrastructure investments are driving overall job creation in
Australia,” Warren Hogan, chief economist at ANZ Bank, said in
a statement.  National vacancies advertised in newspapers fell 8.6
percent in February, and Internet notices advanced 3.8 percent,
today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
