The rand weakened to the lowest in a
week and three-year yields reached the highest in more than a
month after  China  lowered its growth target, damping prospects
for  South Africa ’s commodity exports.  South Africa’s currency depreciated as much as 0.9 percent
and traded 0.4 percent weaker at 7.5530 against the dollar as of
3:26 p.m. in Johannesburg. The yield on the nation’s 65 billion
rand of 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 6.69 percent, the highest since Jan.
20.  Prices of metals including copper, gold and platinum fell
after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao pared the nation’s economic
growth target to 7.5  percent from an 8 percent goal in place
since 2005. China is the biggest buyer of South African  raw
materials  including metals, according to government data for
2011.  China’s growth outlook “is keeping a lid on rand
strength,” Nomvuyo Guma, a Johannesburg-based currency
strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in e-mailed
comments. “The growing global uncertainty is likely to keep
proceedings somewhat subdued. We see the rand’s current levels
as unsustainable” given the outlook for growth, she added.  Raw materials including metals account for 65 percent of
South Africa’s exports. The currencies of other commodity-
exporting countries such as Australia and  Canada  also declined
today. South Africa’s benchmark stock  index  slipped for a second
day, led by metal exporters including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and
 Anglo American Plc. (AAL)   The yield on the nation’s $1.5 billion of 4.665 percent
notes due 2024 dropped five basis points to 4.14 percent. The
extra yield investors demand to hold the debt rather than U.S.
Treasuries narrowed 6.5 basis points to 214 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
