Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , a U.K. oil and gas
engineer, said it can grow its order backlog this year after
reporting a 25 percent increase in profit.  Earnings rose to $539.4 million last year, the company said
today in a statement in  London , excluding the gain on the
EnQuest merger in 2010.  Sales increased 33 percent to $5.8 billion and the company
raised the final dividend 24 percent to 37.2 cents. The order
backlog was $10.8 billion at the end of 2011, compared with
$11.7 billion a year earlier.  “Over time, we expect to see backlog grow in line with
revenue growth,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Weller said on a
conference call with journalists. “We didn’t chase many new
orders in 2011. In 2012, we expect to be much more active in the
bidding process.”  Petrofac expects profit to gain 15 percent this year after
it beat a 20 percent growth target for 2011. Chief Executive
Officer Ayman Asfari is expanding the business in  Thailand ,
 Nigeria , Mexico and Iraq.  Shares rose 1.3 percent to 1,595 pence as of the market
close in London. The stock has gained 37 percent since the start
of October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
