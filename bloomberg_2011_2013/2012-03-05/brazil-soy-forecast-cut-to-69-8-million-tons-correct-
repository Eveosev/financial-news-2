(Corrects previous forecast in second paragraph.)  Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
largest producer after the U.S., will harvest less of the
oilseed than previously expected after a drought damaged crops,
forecaster Celeres said.  Output in the crop year that started Aug. 1 will drop 6.7
percent from a year earlier to 69.8 million metric tons, Celeres
said in an e-mailed report. The estimate was cut from 72 million
estimated on Feb. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
