Peruvian bonds fell, pushing up
yields for the second time in three days, on concern demand for
metal exports may wane after  China  cuts its economic growth
target.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.47 percent at 11:53 a.m. in  Lima ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The security’s price
declined 0.05 centimo to 115.81 centimos per sol.  Copper prices fell in New York as China’s 8 percent annual
growth target, in place since 2005, was lowered to 7.5 percent,
and on signs automobile sales in the Asian country may be having
their worst start in seven years amid a slowing economy.  “China represents 30 percent of the world copper market
and is the motor of the emerging world,” said  Roberto Flores ,
head of research at Inteligo SAB, a Lima-based brokerage. “If
the Chinese government is comfortable with 7.5 percent,
economies in the region, including Peru, could grow more
slowly.”  China overtook the U.S. as Peru’s top export market last
year on rising purchases of copper, gold and iron ore. Metals
account for two-thirds of the Andean nation’s sales overseas.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6750 per  U.S. dollar , according
to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
