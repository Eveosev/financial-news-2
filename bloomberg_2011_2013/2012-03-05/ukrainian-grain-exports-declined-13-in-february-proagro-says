Ukrainian grain exports from ports
fell 13 percent last month to 1.67 million metric tons,
researcher ProAgro said, without giving a reason.  The total compares with the 1.91 million tons shipped in
January, the Kiev-based agricultural researcher said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Deliveries of corn slid to 1.19 million tons from 1.34
million tons, according to the statement.  Egypt  was the largest
buyer, purchasing 290,600 tons of the grain, followed by Iranian
imports of 139,500 tons, ProAgro said.  Ukraine-grown corn bound for  Japan  is being delivered with
a delay, the researcher said. Corn contracted for this month
will be delivered in April, it said.  Exports of the grain from Ukraine in the current marketing
year running through June will come to 13 million tons,
according to ProAgro.  Wheat shipments declined to 442,780 tons last month from
Januaryâ€™s 484,680 tons and went mainly to Egypt and  Israel ,
ProAgro said. Deliveries to Egypt more than doubled to 187,360
tons, it said. Exports of the grain from Ukraine in the current
marketing year will be no higher than 6 million tons, according
to the researcher.  Another 998,180 tons of corn, 199,650 tons of wheat and
132,500 tons of barley will be exported from Ukrainian ports
soon, ProAgro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
