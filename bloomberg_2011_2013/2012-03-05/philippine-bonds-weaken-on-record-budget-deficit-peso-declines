Philippine 10-year bonds fell,
pushing the yield to a one-month high, after the government
reported the  budget deficit  widened to a record in December. The
peso weakened.  The shortfall was 101.5 billion pesos ($2.4 billion), the
government said in a statement released in  Manila  today,
compared with 22 billion pesos for November reported earlier.
That is the highest since Bloomberg began tracking the data in
1994. President  Benigno Aquino  accelerated spending on roads and
schools to bolster an economy struggling to counter the effects
of Europe’s debt crisis.  “The market found the high deficit as an excuse for
pushing the yields up,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , market
strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. in Manila.  The yield on the government’s 6.375 percent bonds due
January 2022 increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 5.31 percent, according to noon fixing prices from the
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. That was the highest level
since Jan. 31. The rate reached a record low of 4.98 percent on
Feb. 21.  The full-year budget gap was 197.8 billion pesos last year,
compared with a record 314.5 billion pesos in 2010.  The Philippine peso retreated from its highest level in
more than a week as regional equities fell and on concern a
prolonged crisis in Europe will hurt growth.  ‘Sector Headwinds’  Greece ’s private creditors are due to decide this week
whether to sign off on the biggest sovereign-debt restructuring
in history. Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said today the world’s
second-biggest economy may expand 7.5 percent this year, the
lowest target since 2004. The peso has appreciated 2.3 percent
in 2012 as foreign funds bought $546 million more local stocks
than they sold through March 2, according to exchange data.  “For me the peso has really done well year-to-date,” said
 Nizam Idris , a currency strategist at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
 Singapore . “The issue is whether appreciation can continue even
as global growth is likely to slow. There’s fear over what’s
going on in  Europe .”  The peso declined 0.4 percent to 42.88 per dollar at the
close in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 42.603 on March 2, the strongest level since Feb. 21.
The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares slid 0.9 percent.  The success of Greece’s 106 billion-euro ($140 billion)
debt swap depends on how many investors agree to the writedown
by a March 8 deadline. Euro-area finance ministers will hold a
teleconference on March 9 to review the deal’s outcome.  Rate Cut  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas cut  interest rates  for a second
time this year on March 1 to shore up growth. The government
will probably report tomorrow that consumer-price gains slowed
to 3.2 percent in February from 3.9 percent in January,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. That would be the least since October 2009.  “Global economic conditions are expected to stay subdued
as fiscal and banking sector headwinds in advanced economies
affect global output growth and as market confidence remains
fragile,”  Bangko Sentral  said in a statement on March 1. Policy
makers cut the rate on overnight deposits by 25 basis points, or
0.25 percentage point, to 4 percent last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
