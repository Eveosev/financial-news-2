Greece  could cover 30 percent of its
energy needs from its own resources, based on current data for
known oil and natural gas reserves, Deputy Energy Minister
Yiannis Maniatis said today in an interview on state-run NET TV.  At present, the country spends 12 billion euros ($16
billion) a year on energy imports, he said.  Hydrocarbon production revenue won’t be employed to reduce
Greece’s debt; it will be used to set up a special fund similar
to  Norway ’s government pension funds, Maniatis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
