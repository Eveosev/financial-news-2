Saudi Arabia  removed restrictions on
cement imports to secure extra supplies at stable prices, the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry said.  “There are no restrictions on cement imports currently,”
according to a statement posted on the ministry’s  website .
Cement exports have already been halted and plants have been
ordered to operate at full capacity.  The kingdom’s western region, which includes the Red Sea
port city of Jeddah and the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and
Medina, has suffered a cement shortage as the government has
increased infrastructure spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
