Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) ,  China ’s biggest
producer of the industrial metal, plans to accelerate
development of rare earths at a project in southwestern Sichuan
province to meet export demand.  “Output of rare-earth oxide at the Mianning mine will
eventually reach 50,000 metric tons a year,” Chairman Li Yihuang said in Beijing today, without giving a timeframe.
“When the project is completed, Jiangxi Copper will be among
the country’s three largest rare-earth producers.”  China controls more than 90 percent of the world’s market
for rare earths, a group of 17 metals used in weapons, hybrid
vehicles and laptop computers. The nation’s rare-earth industry
has an output capacity of about 200,000 tons, Chen Zhanheng, a
researcher at the Chinese Society of Rare Earths, wrote in a
 commentary  in the official  China Daily  last year.  Jiangxi Copper also plans to acquire domestic copper assets
to expand production, and is currently in talks with “some
companies,” Li said, declining to give details.  “Copper demand is fairly sound,” Li told reporters after
attending the opening of China’s legislature. “Prices will
consolidate at current levels, which are largely in line with
the company’s forecast” of 59,000 yuan ($9,353) a ton, he said.  Jiangxi Copper has slumped 19 percent in Hong Kong trading
in the past year, compared with the 8.8 percent drop in the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index . The  stock  fell 4.1 percent to close
at HK$20.15 today.  Copper for three-month delivery declined 0.9 percent to
$8,502 a ton by 10 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Ryan Woo, John Chacko.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
