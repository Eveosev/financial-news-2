Wheat production in  Australia , the
world’s second-biggest shipper, may drop 13 percent from a
record as farmers switch to barley and canola on better returns,
a government commodity forecaster said.  Output may total 25.7 million metric tons in the year from
July 1, from a record 29.5 million tons a year earlier, the
Canberra-based  Australian Bureau  of Agricultural and Resource
Economics and Sciences said today. The area may decline 2.5
percent to 13.7 million hectares (33.9 million acres) as canola
plantings rise 4.8 percent and barley sowings gain 2.9 percent,
it said in a report.  Rising incomes and growing populations in  emerging markets 
are fueling demand for farm products, helping push global  food
costs  1.9 percent higher in January, the most in 11 months, the
 United Nations  said. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  Agriculture
Index (SPGSAG)  of eight commodities has advanced 2.9 percent this year.  “Things are looking a little better for barley and canola
than wheat,”  Paul Morris , bureau executive director, said in an
interview yesterday. “Because of the nature of Australian
agriculture, where there’s a lot of mixed-enterprise farms and
the farmers are quite savvy to changes in prices, they’ll move
to some extent between activities depending on price.”  Canola, Barley  Wheat futures have tumbled 16 percent in the past year as
global production and inventories headed for records and world
trade surged to the second-highest level in at least in five
decades. Global stockpiles may reach 220 million tons in 2012-
2013 from 213 million tons a year earlier, Mike O’Dea, a senior
risk manager at INTL FCStone Inc., said Feb. 22.  Canola futures have declined 3.2 percent on ICE Futures
Canada and 2.3 percent on NYSE Liffe in Paris in the past year,
while barley futures gained 7.3 percent.  Australia’s canola production may increase 5.4 percent to a
record 2.9 million tons in 2012-2013 and barley output may gain
5.1 percent to 9 million tons, Abares said today. Wheat  exports 
may total 21 million tons in the year from July, from a record
21.2 million tons a year earlier, it said. Australia is set to
be the second-biggest wheat exporter in 2011-2012 after the U.S.,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Black Sea , U.S.  The area sown to wheat, coarse grains and oilseeds in
Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine may increase by an average of 2
percent a year to about 90 million hectares “over the medium
term,” the bureau said. Between 11 million hectares and 13
million hectares of idle land suitable for cropping is available
for expansion, it said.  The so-called free-on-board Gulf price of U.S. hard-red
winter wheat may fall 7 percent to average $275 per ton in 2012-
2013, reflecting record world opening stockpiles and expected
high global production, the bureau said. Global wheat  stockpiles 
may total about 210 million tons in 2012-2013 as production
exceeds consumption and as inventories in the U.S. rise about 10
percent to 28 million tons, it said.  “Globally, we’ve seen prices for crops come down a bit
over the last few months and we’re expecting, in real terms,
that prices will ease over the next few years,” the bureau’s
Morris said. “In terms of returns, they’ll be a little less
favorable than in the last 12 months or so but, in historical
terms, remaining reasonably high.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
