Crude oil options volatility rose to
the highest level in seven sessions as underlying futures were
little changed after fluctuating much of the day on lower
volume.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 29.8 as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up from
28.3 on March 2.  Crude for March delivery rose 2 cents to settle at $106.72
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Since Feb. 17, the
front-month contract has traded in a range of $104.26 and
$110.55. Preliminary volume in electronic trading for crude oil
was 445,242 contracts as of 3:08 p.m. in New York, 28 percent
below the three-month average.  “We’re stuck in a relatively small range,” said Fred
Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
April $100 puts, with 1,442 lots changing hands at 3:58 p.m.
They fell 7 cents to 34 cents a barrel. April $103 puts, the
second-most active options, declined 18 cents to 75 cents with
769 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 57 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Bearish options accounted for 58 percent of the 129,061
trades from the previous session. April $100 puts were the most
actively traded, with 8,353 lots changing hands as they rose 13
cents to 41 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, April
$95 puts, gained 3 cents to 11 cents on volume of 5,844.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 46,154
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 38,687 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,926.  To contact the reporter on this story:
