Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the worldâ€™s
largest crude exporter, raised its April official selling prices
for Arab Light grade from the Egyptian port of Sidi Keir while
cutting Arab Heavy, two people with knowledge of the matter
said.  Saudi Aramco , as the state-run company is known, raised the
differential of Arab Light by 15 cents from March to a discount
of 75 cents a barrel to the Brent weighted average, or BWAVE,
posted by  Intercontinental Exchange , said the people, who
declined to be identified as the information is confidential.
Arab Heavy was set at $4.45 a barrel less than the benchmark,
down 25 cents from March.  Prices of all four crude grades from Sidi Kerir were 35
cents more expensive than those from  Ras Tanura  in the  Persian
Gulf  for customers in the Mediterranean, they said.  Saudi Aramco raised prices for crude to  Asia  by as much as
$3.40, while reducing most differentials to northwest  Europe  and
the Mediterranean, the company said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  The following table gives differentials for the four grades
loading from Sidi Kerir in relation to BWAVE on a free-on-board
basis, the month-on-month change and the degrees of gravity as
defined by the  American Petroleum Institute . Prices are in U.S.
dollars a barrel.  *T Sidi  Kerir
