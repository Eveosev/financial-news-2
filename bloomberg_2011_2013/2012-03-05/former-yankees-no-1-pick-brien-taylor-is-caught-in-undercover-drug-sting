Brien Taylor, who received a then-
record $1.6 million bonus after being chosen by the  New York
Yankees  with the first pick in the 1991 Major League Baseball
draft, was arrested last week on 15 drug-related charges.  He never got to the major leagues and hadn’t pitched in 12
years, his career deteriorating after he injured his throwing
shoulder in a non-baseball-related fight in December 1993.  Taylor, 40, sold “a large quantity” of cocaine and crack
cocaine to undercover narcotics agents over a period of several
months, according to a statement from the  Carteret County
Sheriff’s Office  in Beaufort,  North Carolina .  A Beaufort resident, Taylor was arrested March 1 and in
court the next day. He remains in Carteret County Jail under
$275,000 bond, Captain Jason Wank said today in an e-mail. The
case will be continued on March 23.  He was charged with a total of 15 counts, including
possession with intent to manufacture, sell and deliver cocaine.  Rated the sport’s best prospect by  Baseball America  in
1992, Taylor was 19-15, with 337 strikeouts and a 3.02 earned-
run average, in his first two seasons in Class A and Class AA.  Taylor dislocated his left shoulder and tore his labrum
following the 1993 season when he confronted a man who earlier
had fought with his brother. He missed the 1994 campaign
following surgery, and never again advanced past Single-A in
five minor league seasons. He last pitched with the Cleveland
Indians’ affiliate in Columbus,  Georgia , in 2000.  Taylor is one of two former No. 1 picks to retire from
baseball without playing in the Major Leagues. Catcher Steve
Chilcott, drafted first in 1966 by the  New York Mets , played six
minor league seasons before retiring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
