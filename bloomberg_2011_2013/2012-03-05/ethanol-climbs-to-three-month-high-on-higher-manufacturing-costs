Ethanol futures climbed to a three-
month high in  Chicago  as corn surged on speculation that export
demand will increase.  Futures rose after Liu Yonghao, the chairman of New Hope
Group Co.,  China ’s top maker of livestock feed, said the country
should reform its corn-import system by dropping shipping quotas
or boosting the amount buyers are able to purchase. Corn is used
to make ethanol in the U.S.  “Corn was stronger today and ethanol kind of went with
it,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. in Chicago. “I’m sure the ethanol guys need to be bidding
up to get the corn.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery advanced 2.9 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $2.289 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since Dec. 5. Futures have gained 3.9 percent
this year. The March contract expired today.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.245 a gallon and in  New York  the additive rose 3 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $2.33 a gallon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf gained 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$2.315 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel added 2 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $2.365.  Corn for May delivery rose 5.75 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$6.6075 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel distills into at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
