Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS)  crude sank
after  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  shut a pipeline that transports oil from
Superior,  Wisconsin , to Illinois-area refineries.  Supplies of heavy oil may increase after Syncrude Canada
Ltd. shut a coker with about 100,000 barrels a day of capacity
following a March 2 fire. The unit remains shut while being
assessed, Siren Fisekci, a spokeswoman in Calgary for Canadian
Oil Sands Ltd., the project’s largest shareholder, said today in
a telephone interview.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate weakened $1 to $33 a barrel at 2:05 p.m. in
 New York , the widest gap since Feb. 29, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  oil slipped 80 cents to $5.80 a barrel below WTI.
The discount for Bakken oil weakened $2 to $17 a barrel.  Enbridge was forced to halt crude deliveries on lines 14
and 64 after two vehicles collided March 3, starting a fire at a
pumping station near New Lenox,  Illinois , 36 miles (58
kilometers) southwest of  Chicago .  The Calgary-based company may start operating Line 14 on
March 7 and Line 64 the following day, Lorraine Little, a
spokeswoman in Superior, Wisconsin, said in an e-mail yesterday.
Lines “upstream of Superior will require slowdown or shutdown
to manage tank levels,” she said.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast, Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
WTI added 90 cents to $19.60 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
increased 15 cents to a premium of $20.65.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI widened 35 cents to $18.35
and Mars Blend’s decreased 20 cents to $13.80. Poseidon’s
premium narrowed 20 cents to $13.30 a barrel. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium added 50 cents to $13.75 over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 5 cents to $4.05 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
