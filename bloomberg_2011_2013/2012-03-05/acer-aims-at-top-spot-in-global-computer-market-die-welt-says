Acer Inc. (2353)  is aiming at the top spot
in the global computer market, Die Welt newspaper reported,
citing an interview with  Jim Wong , the companyâ€™s president.  Acer will regain market share by offering thin, light
laptops called ultrabook that can be used as quickly as tablet
computers; their price will drop to $800 this year and as low as
$500 in 2013, the newspaper cited Wong as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
