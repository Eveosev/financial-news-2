German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
there’s “no alternative” to developing the euro region into an
area of stability, which includes the need for all its members
to adhere to budgetary rules.  “There is no alternative to developing the European Union,
and the euro zone at its core, into a stable zone and to take
the necessary measures for that,” Merkel said today in a speech
in Hanover,  Germany . “That means, on the one hand, trust in
everybody adhering to the rules, for example as regards stable
budget policies and solid budget policies, and on the other hand
trust that there are mechanisms of solidarity in place within
this European Union and the euro zone in these difficult times
that give every participant the chance to prove in coming years
the solidity that may have been absent in the past.”  The euro region’s debt crisis threw the bloc into a “true
crisis,” Merkel said at the opening of the CeBit computer fair
in the state capital of  Lower Saxony . Still, the EU with its 500
million inhabitants has “every chance to participate in dynamic
global developments,” Merkel said.  Portugal will “absolutely not” alter the deficit goals it
pledged in return for a European Union-led aid package last
year, Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said in an interview in
Lisbon today after Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  on March
2 defied European Union allies by raising Spain’s budget-deficit
target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
