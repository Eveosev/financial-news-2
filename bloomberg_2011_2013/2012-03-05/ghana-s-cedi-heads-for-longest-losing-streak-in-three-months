Ghana ’s cedi headed for its longest
losing streak against the dollar in more than three months as
manufacturers and telecommunications companies bought dollars.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.1 percent to 1.7088 per dollar as of 1:37 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, a fourth day of declines, the worst run
since Nov. 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Manufacturing and telecommunications companies sought the
dollar today to import raw material and equipment,” Kobla Nyaletey, a currency trader at the Ghanaian unit of Barclays
Bank Plc, said by phone today. “There were no major sellers on
the market today.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
