Olympus Corp. (7733)  and  TDK Corp. (6762)  led a
decline among Japanese exporters in  Tokyo  trading after the yen
strengthened and China cut its economic growth target.  Olympus, the Japanese camera maker trying to rebuild its
image after admission of covering up losses, fell 5.5 percent to
1,256 yen, the most since Dec. 19, on the  Tokyo Stock Exchange. (NKY) 
TDK, which makes magnetic heads for disk drives, declined 3.7
percent to 4,190 yen, the most since Dec. 15.  Japanese exporters contributed most to a 0.8 percent drop
in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average, as the local currency
rose against the dollar. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao set an
economic growth target of 7.5 percent for this year, the least
since 2004, in a speech at the National People’s Congress in
Beijing today.  “Rising yen and China outlook weaken sentiment for
exporters including Olympus,”  Mitsuo Shimizu , an analyst at
Cosmo Securities Co. in Tokyo, said by telephone.  The Japanese yen registered the only gain against the U.S.
dollar among 15 major currencies today, strengthening 0.76
percent as of 5 p.m. in Tokyo. The currency’s advance hurts the
overseas competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers and reduces
the value of repatriated earnings.  Olympus  gets  about 20 percent of sales from  North America 
and more than 19 percent from Europe, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. China accounts for about 30 percent of TDK’s sales, while
the Americas and Europe make up 25 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sony Corp. (6758)  fell 3.3 percent, the biggest drop since Nov.
16, to 1,691 yen. Sony gets about 70 percent of its sales
outside of Japan, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office will arrest
former Olympus executives including ex-chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa for misrepresentation of the company’s securities
report, the Mainichi newspaper reported March 4, without saying
where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
