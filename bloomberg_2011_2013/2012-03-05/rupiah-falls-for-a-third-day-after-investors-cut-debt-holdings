Indonesia ’s rupiah declined for a
third straight day after global investors cut holdings of the
nation’s bonds by the most since September.  International funds reduced their investment in government
notes by 8.99 trillion rupiah ($986 million) in February,
according to data from the  finance ministry . The Bloomberg-
JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell for a second straight day after
Spain raised its budget deficit target to 5.8 percent for 2012,
compared with the 4.4 percent previously agreed with its
European partners.  “The news from Spain signals that there is still an
ongoing debt issue in  Europe ,” said Apressyanti Senthaury, a
Jakarta-based research analyst in the treasury division of PT
Bank Negara Indonesia. “ Bank Indonesia  will keep the rupiah
from weakening too drastically.”  The rupiah lost 0.5 percent to 9,128 per dollar as of 3:53
p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  The central bank has been intervening in the currency and
bond markets to curb volatility, Governor Darmin Nasution said
on Feb. 10.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage points, to 5.51
percent, according to midday prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
