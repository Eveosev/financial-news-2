Cotton for May delivery rose by the
exchange limit of 4 cents, or 4.5 percent, to 92.23 cents a
pound at 8:27 a.m. in  New York . A close at that price would be
the biggest one-day percentage gain since May 31.  India , the worldâ€™s second-biggest exporter, halted
shipments until further notice, the Commerce Ministry said in a
statement dated today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
