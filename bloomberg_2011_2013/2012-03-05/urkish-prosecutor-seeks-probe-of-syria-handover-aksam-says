Turkey ’s special prosecutors asked
for approval from Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  to
investigate four members of the country’s spy agency in
connection with the kidnapping of Syrian defectors, Aksam  said .  Colonel Hussein Mustafa Harmush and Major Mustafa Kassum,
who had fled to Turkey with their troops, were handed over to
President Bashar al-Assad’s forces after Turkey’s National
Intelligence Organization detained the men in August, according
to the Istanbul-based newspaper. The defectors were involved in
forming the opposition Free Syrian Army, whose command center is
in Turkey, Aksam reported.  Turkey’s parliament passed a law last month requiring the
prime minister to approve investigations into the intelligence
organization and other civil servants acting under his orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
