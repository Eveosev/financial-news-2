1Malaysia Development Bhd., the
state investment company also known as 1MDB, agreed to buy
billionaire T. Ananda Krishnan’s power assets for about $3.2
billion, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  1MDB agreed to purchase the assets after resolving
technical issues related to the deal, said the people, who
declined to be named as the process is private. 1MDB plans to
finance the purchase through bank loans, one of the people said.  As many as four groups including Saudi Water & Electricity
Co. were put on a shortlist to bid for the 13  power plants  that
the tycoon owned through Tanjong Plc, people familiar with the
deal said on Feb. 28.  The sale marks the second major divestment in a year by
Ananda Krishnan, Malaysia’s second-richest man according to
Forbes magazine. He sold Tanjong’s gaming business, Pan
Malaysian Pools Sdn., for 2.1 billion ringgit ($696 million)
last year to a group of businessmen including Genting Bhd.
Chairman Lim Kok Thay, two people familiar with the matter said
at the time.  1MDB’s communications head Robert Ho didn’t respond to
calls seeking comment on the deal. Tanjong’s Chief Financial
Officer Gerard Nathan declined to comment.  Tanjong Energy has assets of 9.3 billion ringgit with power
plants in countries including  Malaysia ,  Egypt , Pakistan and
United Arab Emirates, according to its  website . The company
posted net income of 514 million ringgit on sales of 2.54
billion ringgit for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
