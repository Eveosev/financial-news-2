An  ATS Corp. (ATSC)  shareholder sued the
company’s directors for spurning higher takeover offers than the
one from Salient Federal Solutions Inc.  Two unidentified parties offered to pay more than the $3.20
a share proposed by Salient, ATS said in U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission  filings . ATS failed to explore one bid of
$3.35 a share, shareholder Stourbridge Investments LLC said in
the complaint made public today in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington.  ATS, a McLean, Virginia-based provider of software to U.S.
government agencies, disclosed the planned merger on Feb. 21.
The deal, valued at about $73 million, will be financed with
Fairfax, Virginia-based Salient’s equity-capital commitments and
debt financing, the companies said.  The deal is unfair, inadequate and serves no legitimate
business purpose for ATS, Stourbridge said in court papers.  Penny Parker, a spokeswoman for ATS, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Stourbridge Investments LLC v. Bersoff, CA7300,
Court of Chancery of the State of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
