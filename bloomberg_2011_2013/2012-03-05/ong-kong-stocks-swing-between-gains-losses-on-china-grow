Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  dropping to its lowest close in a week, as China said
it’s targeting the slowest economic growth since 2004.  Industrial & Commercial Bank Ltd. (1398) , the world’s biggest
lender by market value, decreased 2.7 percent. BYD Co., a
Chinese carmaker partly owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., slid 4 percent on speculation vehicle demand in
China fell as the economy slowed. PetroChina Co. declined 2.7
percent after the company’s chairman said refining losses last
year were bigger than expected.  The  Hang Seng  Index dropped 1.4 percent to 21,265.31 as of
the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong, the lowest level since Feb. 27.
The gauge advanced the past three months, its longest such
winning streak since December 2009, as  China  cut reserve ratios
for lenders amid signs the  U.S. economy  is improving, and
optimism confidence  Europe  will contain its debt crisis.  “ Asia  is all about moderation now,” said  Andrew Pease ,
Sydney-based chief investment strategist for the Asia-Pacific
region at Russell Investment Group, which manages about $150
billion. “It’s a much more challenging market to be bullish in.
While the risk of financial Armageddon in Europe is gone, Europe
is still going to have a large recession. Europe is China’s
biggest export market. That tempers optimism on how much the
risk rally can continue.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
decreased 2.3 percent to 11,470.70. The Stock Exchange of  Hong
Kong  shortened its midday trading break from today. Afternoon
trading will open 30 minutes earlier and run from 1 p.m. until 4
p.m.  ‘Proactive’ Policies  AIA Group Ltd. (1299) , partially owned by bailed out insurer
American International Group Inc., was suspended after a
document obtained by Bloomberg showed the U.S. parent company
will sell about $6 billion worth of its shares at between
HK$27.15 to $27.50 apiece. The shares last traded at HK$29.20 on
March 2.  Chinese lenders declined as Premier  Wen Jiabao  said today
the government will target economic growth of 7.5 percent this
year, the lowest goal since 2004, and inflation of about 4
percent. Wen reiterated that the government will maintain
“proactive” fiscal and “prudent” monetary policies.  ICBC, as China’s biggest lender is known, fell 2.7 percent
to HK$5.47.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the nation’s second-
largest lender, slipped 2 percent to HK$6.43.  “This low growth target with relatively high inflation
suggests monetary policy will be relatively relaxed,” said Liu Li-Gang, head of Greater China economics at Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. “This in turn will
help increase bank lending and boost investment.”  China Autos  The mainland’s carmakers slipped as automobile sales in the
world’s second-largest economy may have fallen 3 percent in the
first two months of the year from a year earlier, based on
median estimate of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg. That
would be the biggest drop since 2005, when they fell 8.9 percent,
according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers,
which will release industry data later this month.  BYD dropped 4 percent to HK$23.80. Great Wall Motor Co., a
Chinese maker of sports utility vehicles, slid 3.6 percent to
HK$15.08.  Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (1114) , a partner
of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, declined 2.5 percent to HK$8.72.  China will control the increase in auto manufacturing
capacity and encourage mergers and reorganizations in the
industry, according to a report that Wen delivered at the
nation’s legislature.  ‘Widening Losses’  The government will promote new-energy vehicles and
encourage the scrapping of old vehicles to reduce pollution,
according to a separate report today by the National Development
and Reform Commission, the country’s top economic planner.  PetroChina, the mainland’s second-largest refiner, fell 2.7
percent to HK$11.44. Crude refining “losses are widening” as
 oil prices  increased, Chairman Jiang Jiemin said in Beijing
today. “We can’t see a turnaround in the situation.”  China, which controls fuel prices to curb inflation,
introduced a pricing system in December 2008 that allows retail
fuel prices to be adjusted when the moving average of a basket
of three crude varieties changes more than 4 percent over 22
working days.  Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., China’s largest hypermarket
operator, tumbled 6.7 percent to HK$9.93 after reporting slower
same-store sales growth. Sinopac Securities Asia Ltd. downgraded
the stock to “neutral” from “buy,” citing weakening consumer
spending in the mainland.  The Hang Seng Index rose 17 percent this year through March
2. The rally boosted the price of shares on the gauge to 11
times  estimated earnings . That compares with 13.1 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.1 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  Among stocks that advanced,  Pacific Century Premium
Developments Ltd. (432) , the property unit of billionaire  Richard Li ’s
PCCW Ltd., surged 28 percent to HK$1.81 as it resumed trading
after announcing plans to buy back as much as 38 percent of its
shares at HK$1.85 each.  Futures on the Hang Seng expiring in March dropped 1.8
percent to 21,157. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  increased 8.4
percent to 22.41, indicating options traders expect a swing of
6.4 percent in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
