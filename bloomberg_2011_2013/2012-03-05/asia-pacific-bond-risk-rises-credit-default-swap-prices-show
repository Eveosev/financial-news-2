The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 3.5 basis points to 160.5 basis
points as of 8:44 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The index is headed for its largest daily climb since Feb.
10, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose 3.5 basis points to
141 basis points as of 11:11 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The gauge is also set for its biggest
daily increase since Feb. 10, according to CMA, which is owned
by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index rose 2 basis points to 141.5
as of 9:16 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
