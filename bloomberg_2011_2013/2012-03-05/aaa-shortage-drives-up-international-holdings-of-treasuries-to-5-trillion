For all the concern that the $10
trillion market for Treasuries is dependent on Federal Reserve
purchases to absorb a continually expanding supply of debt, the
amount held by investors outside the U.S. has  grown  even more.  Foreigners increased their holdings of  U.S. government debt 
by $1.84 trillion to a record $5 trillion since the Fed began
the first round of Treasury purchases in May 2009, taking their
stake to 60.5 percent of the securities not held by the central
bank, government data show. The Fed added $1.18 trillion during
that period, to $1.65 trillion, or 16.8 percent of the total,
from 7.6 percent.  International buying underpins President Barack Obama’s
financing of a  budget deficit  forecast to exceed $1 trillion for
a fourth year. Ten-year note yields stuck below the rate of
inflation have caused hedge fund manager  Leon Cooperman  to shun
the debt. At the same time, the risk of declines has been
limited by the shrinking supply of AAA rated alternatives.  “There are buyers that lurk everywhere,” said  William O’Donnell , head U.S. government bond strategist at RBS
Securities Inc. in  Stamford , Connecticut, one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed, said in a Feb. 29 telephone
interview. “There’s plenty of cash out there that would love to
get its hands on quality assets at a reasonable rate. The
problem is, there’s not enough high-quality liquid bonds.”  European Holdings Rise  Ten-year Treasuries have lost 0.3 percent and U.S.
government securities of all maturities are down 0.3 percent in
2012 after 10-year debt gained 17 percent and the broader market
returned 9.8 percent in 2011, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch bond indexes. Investors continue to pile into U.S.
assets amid concerns about the outcome of the Europe debt crisis
and the pace of the U.S. recovery.  Treasuries were steady last week, with 10-year note yields
unchanged at 1.98 percent. The benchmark 2 percent security due
February 2022 was unchanged at 100 7/32. The two-year note yield
fell 3 basis points to 0.29 percent.  Ten-year notes yielded 1.98 percent, and two-year rates
were little changed today as of 9:47 a.m. in New York.  International holdings increased 13 percent in 2011, led by
Europe, as investors sought safety from declining sovereign
 credit quality .  Luxembourg (HOLDLU)  increased its stake by 74 percent in
2011 to $150.6 billion,  Switzerland (HOLDSW)  boosted its amount 33
percent to $142.5 billion and Belgium’s position in the debt
more than  quadrupled  to $135.2 billion, according to data
released by the Treasury Feb. 29.  Funding the ‘Parasite’  The U.S. dollar’s share of global foreign-exchange reserves
climbed in the third quarter to 61.7 percent, the  highest  since
late 2010, while holdings of  euros  fell to a three-year low of
25.7 percent, according to quarterly figures from the
Washington-based  International Monetary Fund .  “They’re looking for safety and liquidity,”  Carl Lantz ,
head of interest-rate strategy in New York at primary dealer
Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a Feb. 29 telephone interview.
“There hasn’t been a credible alternative to the dollar
presented.”  Russia increased its stake in Treasuries to $149.5 billion,
an 8.3 percent advance since August, when Russian Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  called the U.S. a “parasite” because he said
its rising debt is weighing on the global economy.  European gains helped make up for the decline in holdings
by  China , the largest foreign lender to the U.S. The world’s
second-largest economy cut its Treasuries 12 percent to $1.15
trillion from a peak of $1.31 trillion in July.  Japan ’s U.S.
government securities rose 20 percent to $1.06 trillion in 2011,
its fourth consecutive annual increase.  ‘Most Dangerous’  Cooperman, 68, founder of equity hedge fund Omega Advisors
Inc., said Feb. 22 in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“InsideTrack” with  Erik Schatzker  that buying Treasuries is
the least attractive investment and the worst place to put money
for the next three years.  Warren Buffett , 81, the billionaire
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said in his annual  letter 
to shareholders that bonds and other holdings tied to currencies
“are among the most dangerous of assets.”  The 10-year  Treasury (USGG10YR)  yield will rise to 2.5 percent by the
end of 2012, according to the average of a Bloomberg News survey
of 78 forecasters. A climb to that level would leave buyers with
a 3 percent loss at year-end, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  While outstanding U.S. public debt expanded to $9.94
trillion in December from $6.27 trillion since March 2009, Fed
and Treasury data show last year’s 13 percent rise in Treasury
holdings by foreigners to $5 trillion was the  least  since 2007.  Shrinking Supply  The supply of AAA rated assets globally has declined about
2.6 percent since peaking in April at $18.8 trillion according
to the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Bond Index. A Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index shows the number of issues in its
AAA index fell to 3,611 from 5,331 in 2007.  Net U.S. fixed-income issuance, including everything from
Treasuries to corporate bonds to mortgage-backed securities, is
forecast to fall to $520 billion this year from $1.2 trillion
last year and $2 trillion in 2010, according to a Jan. 6 Credit
Suisse report. The bank’s U.S. interest-rate strategists
forecast net borrowing will rise to about $967 billion in 2013.  ‘Ultimate Safe Haven’  The debt crisis that started in Greece, Portugal and
Ireland before engulfing Spain and Italy has ratcheted up
pressure on the wealthier members of the euro zone. France was
downgraded to AA+ by  Standard & Poor’s  on Jan. 13 while
investors snubbed AAA rated  Germany  Nov. 23 when it was able to
sell only 65 percent of a 6 billion euro debt offering.  “Treasuries represent the ultimate safe-haven asset,
particularly at a time when investors have been concerned about
the dynamics in  Europe ,” Mark Dowding, a senior  money manager 
at Bluebay Asset Management Ltd. in  London , which manages $39
billion in fixed-income assets, said in March 2 telephone
interview. “We would argue that Treasuries offer a safer haven
than German  bunds , for example, in as much as if Europe really
does hit the skids, Germany will end up paying.”  The cost to insure against the risk of a U.S. default in
the next five years has dropped to 35 basis points from 56.3
basis points on Aug. 8, following the decision by Standard &
Poor’s to lower America’s credit rating to AA+, according to CMA
prices. Protecting against a default by Germany over the same
span has fallen to 76 basis points from 79 basis points.  Quantitative Easing  Last year’s $566.2 billion in purchases were the fewest
since 2007 when international investors bought $250.1 billion of
the debt, Treasury data show. Foreign holdings jumped 20 percent
in each of 2009 and 2010 and 31 percent in 2008.  The Fed said Sept. 21 that it would replace $400 billion of
shorter-maturity Treasuries in its holdings with longer-term
debt to contain borrowing costs. The central bank has made
$226.2 billion of those purchases, which are scheduled to run
through June.  “The driver of low yields today is more Fed action and
policy than foreign investing,” Krishna Memani, director of
fixed income at OppenheimerFunds Inc. in  New York , who helps
manage $70 billion, said in a Feb. 29 telephone interview.
“That’s really the primary driver of yields rather than what
China is doing.”  After buying $2.3 trillion in bonds including $900 billion
of Treasuries in two stages of so-called quantitative easing
ending in June, the Fed has kept its holdings steady at $1.65
trillion.  The central bank said in its Jan. 25 statement that the
economy is “likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the
federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”  Unemployment Falls  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in testimony before the
House Financial Services Committee on Feb. 29 that, while there
have been “positive developments” in the labor market, it
“remains far from normal.”  More than 3.6 million private sector jobs have been added
since the end of 2009, while government employment has dropped
by 506,000 Labor Department data show.  Unemployment dropped to 8.3 percent in January, the lowest
since 2009, and initial jobless claims fell to 351,000 for the
week ended Feb. 25, the fewest since March 2008. Still, the
improvements have yet to spur wage inflation, as average hourly
earnings rose 1.9 percent in January, the smallest increase
since April, and down from 3.2 percent in 2008 and 3.7 percent
in January 2009, Labor Department data show.  Foreign ownership of all public U.S. government debt has
held above 50 percent since September, according to the
Treasury’s revised data. At 50.3 percent as of December,
overseas holdings have risen from 48.4 percent in June, the
lowest since November 2006.  Foreign buyers have “clung on to purchasing Treasuries
even as the Fed sucked most of them out,” Dominic Konstam, head
of interest-rate strategy at primary dealer Deutsche Bank AG in
New York, said in a Feb. 27 telephone interview. “Everyone’s
getting crowded out to some extent, including foreign
officials.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
