Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  questioned the democratic legitimacy of the European
Commission and the authority of the European Parliament,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  reported.  “I was elected, the Hungarian government was also elected,
as well as the European Parliament,” Orban said in an interview
with the newspaper published yesterday. “But who elected the
European Commission? What is its democratic legitimacy? And to
whom is the European Parliament responsible? This is a very
serious problem in the new European architecture.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
