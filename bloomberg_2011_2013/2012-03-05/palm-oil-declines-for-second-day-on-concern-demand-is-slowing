Palm oil fell for a second day in
Malaysia on speculation that demand from importers, including
Pakistan, may continue to slow in the near term.  The May-delivery contract dropped as much as 0.5 percent to
3,244 ringgit ($1,075) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, and traded at 3,247 at 4:03 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .  The “negative news is on demand,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst
at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. Pakistan, the third-largest buyer,
will cut purchases because of a transport issue, and a fall in
Malaysian exports in February showed weak demand, she said.  Imports by Pakistan may drop 22 percent this quarter after
a transporters’ strike closed factories, a refiners’ group said
in remarks reported March 2. Shipments may fall to about 343,000
tons, the Pakistan Edible Oil Refiners Association said.  Malaysian exports  fell 9.5 percent to 1.17 million tons in
February from January, surveyor  Societe Generale  de Surveillance
said on Feb. 29.  Price falls may not last as costlier crude oil increases
 palm oil ’s appeal, while a shortage of  soybean oil  may also
boost palm oil, Ng said.  Palm oil may gain to 3,500 ringgit by mid-April as cooking-
oil demand tops supply, according to TransGraph Consulting Pvt.
Chairman Nagaraj Meda, who’s forecast prices for 13 years. There
was positive momentum after damage to soybean crops, Meda said.  Soybeans for May dropped 0.6 percent to $13.255 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil for the same month
was little changed at 54.02 cents a pound. Soybeans rallied 10
percent last month as drought cut South American supplies.  Crude oil in  New York  traded at $106.68 a barrel. The price
reached $110.55 on March 1 amid concern that supplies from the
 Middle East  may be disrupted.  Palm oil for delivery in September ended little changed at
8,358 ($1,326) yuan a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month climbed 0.2 percent
to close at 9,402 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
