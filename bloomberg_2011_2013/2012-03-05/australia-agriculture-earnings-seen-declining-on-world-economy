Agriculture export earnings by
 Australia , the largest wool and beef shipper, may decline next
financial year on concern that global economic growth will slow,
according to the government’s commodity forecaster.  Earnings from farm, forestry and fisheries products may
total A$38.9 billion ($41.5 billion) in the year from July 1,
the Canberra-based  Australian Bureau  of Agricultural and
Resource Economics and Sciences said today. That compares with
A$39.2 billion a year earlier, it said.  “One of the main risks is the international economy,”
 Paul Morris , executive director, said yesterday. “We are still
very dependent on what happens globally and if the Europeans
don’t get things in order over there, then there’s a flow-on
effect to their purchases from some of our major buyers.”  China  pared the nation’s economic growth target to 7.5
percent from an 8 percent goal in place since 2005 yesterday, a
signal that leaders are determined to reduce reliance on exports
and  capital spending  in favor of consumption. Private creditors
have reached an agreement with Greek and European officials on
the biggest sovereign debt restructuring in history, seeking to
reduce  Greece ’s borrowings by about 106 billion euros and lower
debt to 120.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2020.  Farm-export earnings, including crops and livestock, may
total A$35.1 billion in 2012-2013, while forest and fisheries
exports may total A$3.8 billion, the bureau said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
