The yuan declined to its weakest
level in almost a month on speculation policy makers will slow
appreciation as growth in  Asia ’s biggest economy decelerates.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  set an economic growth target of 7.5
percent for this year, the least since 2004, in a speech at the
National People’s Congress in Beijing today. He also set an
inflation target of 4 percent, unchanged from last year’s. The
People’s Bank of  China  weakened the currency’s daily fixing by
the most since November 2010, setting it 0.22 percent lower at
6.3121 per dollar.  “There isn’t an urge for China to strengthen the yuan as
the export outlook remains uncertain,” said Tommy Ong, the Hong
Kong-based senior vice president of treasury and markets at DBS
Bank ( Hong Kong ) Ltd.  The yuan dropped 0.13 percent to 6.3067 per dollar in
 Shanghai , the weakest closing level since Feb. 6, according to
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency is allowed
to trade 0.5 percent either side of the daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.10
percent to 6.3028. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell
0.14 percent to 6.2910, a 0.2 percent premium to the onshore
spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China will keep the yuan’s exchange rate stable, Wen said.
The currency will appreciate 3 percent this year, compared with
4.7 percent in 2011, Ong forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
