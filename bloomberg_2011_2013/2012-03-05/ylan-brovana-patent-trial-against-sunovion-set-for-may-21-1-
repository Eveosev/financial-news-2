Mylan Inc. (MYL) ’s patent infringement
trial against Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. over the bronchitis
and emphysema drug Brovana was set for May 21.  U.S. District Judge  John Koeltl  set the date today at a
hearing in  Manhattan , saying he would also refer the case to a
magistrate judge for settlement talks. On March 1, Koeltl
invalidated five of the seven patents Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-
based Mylan said were infringed and limited damages that could
be assessed on the other two.  “My client’s willing to discuss settlement,” Joseph O’Malley, a lawyer for Sunovion, told the judge today.  Mylan’s Dey unit sued Sunovion’s predecessor company in
2007 to block the introduction of  Brovana,  which Dey said
infringed a patent for a spray to open bronchial passages. Other
patents were later added to the suit. Brovana, which uses a
variant of the compound formoterol, treats the condition
formally known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Sunovion, based in Marlborough, Massachusetts, is a unit of
Osaka, Japan-based Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd.  The case is Dey v. Sepracor, 07-cv-02353, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
