Iran  plans to export 5,000 megawatts
of electricity to neighboring  India , state-run Press TV
reported, citing Energy Minister Majid Namjou.  The Persian Gulf nation wants to sell power instead of
natural gas because electricity sales will be more cost-
effective, the  broadcaster  said, without elaborating. Iran had a
total generating capacity of 53,000 megawatts before 2009,
according to the report on Press TVâ€™s website.  International sanctions against Iran over its nuclear
program are threatening a $9.5 billion annual trade in crude oil
between India and Iran, the second-largest producer in OPEC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
