OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell the most in more than two weeks after Prime
Minister Viktor Orban’s spokesman said European Union finance
ministers will approve a proposal to cut Hungary’s development
subsidies.  The shares fell 2.3 percent to 3,941 forint by the close in
Budapest, the biggest decline since Feb. 16. The benchmark BUX
stock index dropped 1.6 percent.  Hungary, which has been struggling to start talks on a
bailout from the EU and the  International Monetary Fund  since
last year, also faces the loss of subsidies as a sanction for
exceeding European budget deficit limits. EU ministers will
approve the cut in the so-called cohesion funds in “all
certainty”, Orban’s spokesman,  Peter Szijjarto , told TV2 today.  “It is increasingly obvious that the deal between the
government and the IMF will be delayed,” Zoltan Arokszallasi,
an analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a research report
today.  European stocks dropped, snapping two days of gains, as
 China  cut its economic growth forecast and data showed
manufacturing and services in the euro area shrank more than
estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
