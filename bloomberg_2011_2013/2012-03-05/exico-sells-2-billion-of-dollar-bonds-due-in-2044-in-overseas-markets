Mexico , Latin America’s second-
largest country, sold $2 billion of dollar-denominated bonds,
tapping into record low borrowing costs for its second
international offering this year.  The government issued the 32-year bonds to yield 4.84
percent, or 170 basis points above similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average
yield on the country’s dollar-denominated government debt fell
to a record low 4.29 percent on March 2 from 5.18 percent a year
earlier, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The sale brings Mexico’s dollar debt issuance to $4
billion this year, the most among emerging-market sovereign
borrowers.  “It’s still a good moment to lock in low absolute
funding” costs,  Siobhan Morden , head of Latin America strategy
at Jefferies & Co. Inc. in  New York , said in a telephone
interview from New York.  Mexico is rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB
by Standard & Poor’s. Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc
managed the sale, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
