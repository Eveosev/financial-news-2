Chicago gasoline strengthened after
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  shut crude oil lines following a fire at a pumping
station in  Illinois .  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  narrowed 3 cents to 26 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:35 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
1.81 cents to $3.002 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Midwest (GRP3G387) , or Group 3, narrowed its
discount 0.5 cent to 24 cents a gallon.  Two vehicles collided near the Enbridge station in New
Lenox, Illinois, starting a fire, Lorraine Little, a company
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail March 3. Line 14 may start
operating March 7 and Line 64 the following day, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
