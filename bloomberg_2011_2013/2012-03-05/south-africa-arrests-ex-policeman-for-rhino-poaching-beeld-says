South African police arrested one of
the countryâ€™s most-wanted rhino poachers, a former policeman,
near Kruger National Park on March 2, Beeld reported.  Four rhino horns, about 5.2 million rand ($689,000) in cash
and a number of weapons were confiscated during the arrest in
Hazyview, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. The ex-
policeman was out on bail for a December arrest when he was
caught with 3.2 million rand in cash, Beeld said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
