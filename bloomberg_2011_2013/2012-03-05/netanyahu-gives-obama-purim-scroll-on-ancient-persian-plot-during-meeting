Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  gave President Barack Obama a Purim Megillah scroll,
which tells the story of how Jews prevailed over a plot to kill
them in ancient Persia, which is present-day Iran.  Netanyahu gave Obama the gift today during a White House
meeting, two days before the Jewish holiday of Purim begins.  The bulk of the discussion was on how to stop present-day
Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, the Israeli leader said.  “Israel has succeeded in raising Iran to the center of our
discussions,” Netanyahu told Israeli reporters in Hebrew
following the meeting.  Obama’s position at the private meeting was consistent with
a speech the president gave yesterday to the American  Israel 
Public Affairs Committee in  Washington , in which he said he’d do
what is needed to protect Israel. Obama also said more time
should be given to diplomatic efforts before a military strike
is considered.  “Nothing that he said inside contradicted what he said
outside,” Netanyahu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
