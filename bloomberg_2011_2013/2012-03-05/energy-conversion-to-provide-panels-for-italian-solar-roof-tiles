Energy Conversion  Devices Inc., a
U.S. solar-panel manufacturer that filed for bankruptcy, will
supply products to an Italian building-material company to
incorporate into roofing materials.  Baraclit SpA may install the solar-powered “flat roof”
system on as much as 10 million square meters (108 million
square feet) of its portfolio of industrial rooftops,  Auburn
Hills , Michigan-based Energy Conversion said today in a
statement.  Energy Conversion is seeking to sell its United Solar unit.
The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief Feb. 14 after
its market value dropped 96 percent last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
