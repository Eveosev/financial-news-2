Glencore International Plc, the
commodities trader acquiring  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , is seeking to
refinance about $12 billion of credit lines, according to three
people with knowledge of the matter.  The world’s largest publicly traded commodities supplier
wants to put in place about $3.5 billion of one-year
revolving-credit facilities to replace deals maturing in May,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore also plans to
extend the maturity of an existing $8.34 billion facility by 12
months to 2015 after doing the same last year, the people said.  Glencore hired five banks including  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
Standard Chartered Plc to manage the transaction, said the
people. A spokesman,  Simon Buerk , declined to comment.  Glencore said today that its net income before exceptional
items rose 7 percent in 2011 to $4.06 billion. Sales jumped 28
percent to $186 billion. Net debt declined by 12 percent to
$12.9 billion at the end of December, or two times its earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.  The company’s revolving credit lines due in May pay an
interest margin of 110 basis points, or 1.1 percentage points,
more than the  London interbank offered rate , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The refinancings are separate from a backstop facility of
as much as $6 billion that Glencore is seeking to raise as part
of its 23 billion-pound ($36 billion) bid for rival Xstrata, the
people said.  Glencore decreased 4 percent in  London  to close at 403.35
pence, the lowest level since Jan. 16. Xstrata, the world’s
largest exporter of thermal coal, fell 4.9 percent to 1,137.5
pence, the lowest since Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
