Russia ’s $3.5 billion of bonds due
2020 extended their advance for a third day, pushing the yield
to the lowest in almost two years after  Vladimir Putin  won his
bid to return to the country’s presidency.  The yield on the debt fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.921 percent, the lowest on a closing
basis since they first traded in April 2010. It has declined 59
basis points since the beginning of this year. Ruble-denominated
local notes due August 2016 yielded five basis points less than
on March 2, at 7.35 percent.  Putin won another six years in the Kremlin with 63.8
percent of the votes, according to preliminary results with more
than 99 percent of all ballots counted. Communist leader  Gennady Zyuganov  came second with 17.2 percent, and billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov  followed him with 7.8 percent.  “Sentiment is still good after the election results,”
Roman Dmitriev, who oversees about $150 million in Russian bonds
at OOO Spectr Invest in Moscow, said by e-mail. “Liquidity
conditions are improving.”  The overnight  MosPrime (MOSKON)  rate banks say they charge to lend
to one another dropped nine basis points to 4.69 percent. The
three-month rate declined five basis points to 6.73 percent.  “I think the rally in OFZs will continue,” Konstantin Svyatny, head of fixed income at Investment Company Kapital in
Moscow, said by e-mail. “There’s very good demand from non-
residents, as the last auction of 15-year bonds confirmed. In
addition, after the elections Russia’s sovereign rating may be
raised, which could also contribute to higher prices.”  Bond Sales  The  Finance Ministry  sold 9.8 billion rubles ($334 million)
of 15-year OFZ bonds Feb. 22, its longest-dated domestic notes
offering since 2008. Investors submitted 50.5 billion rubles in
bids, according to the ministry, more than five times the amount
on offer.  The ruble weakened 0.2 percent to 29.34 per dollar at the 7
p.m. close in Moscow, paring its rise so far this year to 9.6
percent. The Russian currency lost 0.4 percent to 33.8125 per
euro.  “The last two weeks of its strengthening have been
overdone,” Andrey Gavrisev, deputy head of foreign exchange
trading at Russian Standard Bank in Moscow, said by e-mail. “I
can’t imagine what kind of event could make it strengthen
further.”  The ruble was 0.3 percent weaker at 33.6026 against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket, after appreciating 2
percent in the two weeks ended March 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
