     March 5 (Bloomberg) --A day after thousands of  Hong Kong 
protesters demanded the resignation of the city’s chief
executive over allegations he accepted favors from businessmen,
officials defended a review of conflict of interest
rules.  “It is of crucial importance for the public to have full
confidence in the system,” Andrew Kwok-nang Li, chairman of a
government committee set up to review the regulations, said
according to a transcript. “We need a good system. It is only
with a good system that we can uphold the dignity and the honor
of these high public offices.”  The government review comes amid allegations  Donald Tsang ,
the city’s chief executive who will retire in four months after
six years in office, accepted favors from businessmen. Hong
Kong’s anti-corruption bureau has begun its first-ever probe
into a chief executive, investigating overseas trips that Tsang
took on luxury yachts and private jets from local business
people.  Hong Kong is in the middle of a campaign to replace the
leader March 25 when a 1,200-member election committee chooses
from three candidates.  “We are an independent committee,” Li said. “We operate
independently. Our responsibility is to review the present
system and suggest improvements to the present system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
