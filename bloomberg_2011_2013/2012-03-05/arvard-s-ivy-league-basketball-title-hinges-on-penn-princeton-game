Harvard University ’s basketball team
has a share of the  Ivy League ’s regular season title and
tomorrow could secure its first trip to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament since 1946.  The Crimson  need help from  Princeton University , which has
to beat the University of Pennsylvania to give Harvard the
league title outright.  If Penn wins tomorrow’s game at  Princeton University , it
would force a one-game playoff between Harvard and Penn for the
conference’s automatic berth in the NCAA tournament. Penn (19-
11), which split its two meetings with Harvard, was an 82-67
winner over Princeton (18-11) on Jan. 30 in Philadelphia.  Harvard improved its record to 26-4 and clinched a share of
the  Ivy League  title with a 67-63 win over Cornell University
two days ago. The Crimson is 12-2 in league play, while Penn is
11-2 against conference opponents.  Harvard’s basketball team, which has gotten recent acclaim
because of Jeremy Lin’s play for the National Basketball
Association’s New York Knicks, made its only NCAA tournament
appearance in 1946, when it lost to Ohio State and  New York
University .  To contact the reporter on this story:
