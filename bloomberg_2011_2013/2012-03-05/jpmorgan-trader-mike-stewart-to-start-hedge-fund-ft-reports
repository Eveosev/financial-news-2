Mike Stewart ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s
global head of proprietary trading, plans to leave the bank to
start his own hedge fund and take some employees with him,
according to the Financial Times.  Stewart, who took over the unit in February 2011, will
start the Whard Stewart hedge fund in the second quarter, and
members of the emerging-markets trading team that he previously
led are expected to join him, the newspaper reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with his plans.  Banks are winding down some proprietary-trading operations
ahead of U.S. rules that restrict deposit-taking institutions
from making bets with their own capital. The so-called Volcker
rule, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that limits risk-taking,
would prohibit lenders from investing more than 3 percent of
 Tier 1 capital  in hedge funds or private-equity funds.  JPMorgan said in 2010 that it planned to move proprietary
traders in the emerging-markets, structured-credit and equity
units to the asset-management division, with Stewart overseeing
the shift. Deepak Gulati, the global head of equity proprietary
trading who’s going to move into the asset-management unit with
his traders this year, also is considering whether to start a
fund, the FT said, citing people with knowledge of his thinking.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a JPMorgan spokeswoman, didn’t return
an e-mailed request for comment and an attempt to reach her by
telephone was unsuccessful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
