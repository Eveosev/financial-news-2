The European Union’s justice chief
 Viviane Reding  is weighing possible quotas to promote more women
to board level, after companies made “limited progress” on
redressing the gender balance.  “I am not a great fan of quotas,” Reding said in an e-
mailed statement. “However, I like the results they bring.”
She said the lack of women “in top jobs in the business world
harms  Europe ’s competitiveness and hampers economic growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
