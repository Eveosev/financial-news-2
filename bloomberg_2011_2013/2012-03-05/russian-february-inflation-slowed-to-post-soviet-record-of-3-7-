Russiaâ€™s inflation decelerated in
February to the slowest annual rate since the  Soviet Union 
collapsed two decades ago as non-food costs eased.  Consumer prices rose 3.7 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 4.2 percent in January, the Federal Statistics
Service in Moscow said in an e-mailed statement today. Prices
rose 0.4 percent from a month earlier. Economists estimated
increases of 3.9 percent and 0.5 percent, two surveys showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
