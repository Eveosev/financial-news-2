Amlin Plc (AML) , the biggest Lloyd’s of
London insurer by market value, posted a bigger-than-estimated
full-year loss after the worst year for natural catastrophes on
record.  The net loss was 149.9 million pounds ($237 million),
compared with a 221.8 million-pound profit a year earlier, the
London-based insurer said in a statement today. That missed the
146 million-pound loss estimated by 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “2011 was an exceptionally challenging year for Amlin,”
Chief Executive Officer Charles Philipps said in the statement.
“We expect to return to a good level of profitability in
2012.”  Amlin said it would miss analyst estimates in August after
earthquakes in Japan and  New Zealand , windstorms in the U.S. and
flooding in  Thailand  made 2011 the most costly year on record
for insurers. Amlin sells more policies outside the U.S. than
its rivals, making it worse hit by the catastrophes, Philipps
said last year. The U.S. is typically the biggest source of
revenue for Lloyd’s insurers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
