Open interest in European Union
carbon futures on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange overtook those
in gasoil after surging 55 percent last year, making emissions
the second biggest market by that measure after  Brent crude .  Open interest for EU carbon contracts aggregated across all
expirations as of March 1 was 643,000 contracts, compared with
416,000 on the same day last year, according to data from ICE
Futures Europe.  Interest in carbon has surged as the bloc begins to sell
nearly all allowances to power utilities rather than giving most
of them for free. They have plunged 46 percent in the past year,
on concern about oversupply. They’ve rebounded by more than a
third since Jan. 4, when they reached a record low.  “Among energy markets, carbon is the second most liquid
after crude” in Europe, said Mark Owen-Lloyd, head of carbon
trading at CF Partners (U.K.) LLP in  London . “Banks, utilities,
proprietary traders can all access it and they do,” Owen Lloyd
said in an interview March 1, citing volumes on ICE Futures
Europe and open interest. “As a proxy for the energy markets,
carbon is the best way in.”  Brent crude open interest was 1.1 million contracts on
March 1, up 25 percent from 882,000 a year earlier. Gasoil was
at 529,000 contracts, 24 percent less than the year earlier’s
693,000.  Carbon permits for December fell 1.3 percent today to 8.93
euros ($11.80) a metric ton on ICE, as of 12:54 p.m. They have
increased since last month when European lawmakers considered
temporarily removing some supply from the market.  “There is a political and economical will to push the
carbon price up to the level where it’s reducing emissions,”
Owen-Lloyd said. “We feel reasonably confident about it.”  ‘Irrational Exuberance’  The jump in prices since Jan. 4 may be “ irrational
exuberance ,” he said. “Whether we get to 11 euros is a big
question: it doesn’t take much for people to take profits and
run for cover,” he said. “It’s very nervous out there.”  Most other EU energy markets including natural gas and
power have wider bid-offer spreads and do not trade as
continuously as carbon, Owen-Lloyd said. “There’s an awful lot
more friction in trading them.”  Aggregated open interest for power contracts on  Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ) 
Commodities, the biggest power exchange in Europe, rose 6
percent to 55,818 contracts on March 1 from 52,656 a year
earlier, according to exchange data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
