Room occupancy rate in Mauritian
hotels will probably be about 50 percent to 55 percent this
year, down from 65 percent in 2011, Le Matinal reported, citing
Tommy Wong, chief financial officer of  Sun Resorts Ltd (SUN)  and
treasurer of the countryâ€™s association of hoteliers and
restaurateurs.  Each percentage point fall is equal to a 200-million rupee
($6.9 million) loss in gross income, the Port Louis-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
