(Corrects currency in the first paragraph.)  The Greek government appointed
Guggenheim Partners LLC to act as financial adviser on the 20
billion euro ($26 billion) Helios solar project it’s considering
to help boost income from renewable energy.  Guggenheim Partners will work alongside  National Bank of
Greece SA  on the financing, structuring and staged deployment of
the Helios solar project, the New York-based financial services
company said today in a statement sent by e-mail.  Named after the ancient god of the sun, Helios is a 20
billion-euro project that aims to produce and export as much as
10 gigawatts of solar power by 2020. Greece aims to use the
project’s revenues to reduce government debt by as much as 15
billion euros.  Helios will start with an initial target capacity of 2
gigawatts. As the grid develops, more partners will be brought
in to develop the project, according to the statement.  “Helios is more than an innovative energy solution,” Todd Boehly, president of Guggenheim Partners, said in the statement.
“It represents a significant step in  Greece ’s economic recovery
that also helps accomplish many broader European goals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
