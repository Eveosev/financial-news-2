Cinven Ltd., the U.K. private equity
firm that owns Pizza Express, moved its fund-management division
to Guernsey, a decision that may help reduce its tax bill as it
raises a 5 billion-euro ($6.6 billion) leveraged buyout fund.  The change, implemented in the past weeks, also includes
switching the structure of the company to a limited-liability
partnership, Vanessa Maydon, a spokeswoman for the London-based
firm, said by e-mail today. The move is intended to help Cinven
better manage partners’ appointments and departures, she said.  “The limited liability partnership structure is not a way
of avoiding employer National Insurance” contributions, Maydon
said. “Partners will now officially be self-employed and will,
therefore, have to pay National Insurance themselves,” so “the
tax contribution from the firm and its partners in the U.K. is
likely to go up substantially.”  Financial News reported the change earlier today. The
London-based firm had raised almost half of the 5 billion euros
it is seeking for European leveraged buyouts, people with
knowledge of the fundraising said in November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
