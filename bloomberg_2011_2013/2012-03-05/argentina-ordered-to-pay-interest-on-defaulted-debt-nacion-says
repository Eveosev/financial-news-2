A New York court ruled in favor of
Elliot Management Corp.’s NML Capital fund and ordered  Argentina 
to pay interest on its defaulted debt, newspaper  La Nacion
reported , citing a Feb. 23 ruling.  The ruling by U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa said
Argentina has to make the payments before or at the same time it
pays interest on bonds it issued in its 2005 and 2010 debt
restructurings, according to the Buenos Aires-based newspaper.
Griesa’s order affects all the parties involved in the debt
payments, including banks that make the transfers to
bondholders, Nacion said.  Argentina has appealed the order and the decision has been
suspended, La Nacion said, citing Jorge Arguello, Argentina’s
ambassador in the U.S.  NML is seeking $650 million in capital and interest on its
holdings, La Nacion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
