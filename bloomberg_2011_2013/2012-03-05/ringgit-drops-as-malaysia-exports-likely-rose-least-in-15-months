Malaysia’s ringgit fell to its
lowest level in almost a week as economists predicted that
government data this week will show exports rose the least in 15
months in January.  Overseas shipments increased 3 percent from a year earlier,
the weakest pace since October 2010, according to the median
estimate of 13 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the
March 7 report. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index dropped
for a second day as  China ’s government said it is aiming for
economic growth of 7.5 percent this year, the lowest target
since 2004.  “Export data will give some indication of Malaysian
economic growth,” said  Vishnu Varathan , an economist at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “China’s GDP target means
Asian growth forecasts will be dragged lower as most economies
here are still export-driven.”  The ringgit declined 0.5 percent to 3.0190 per dollar as of
4:40 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.0210 earlier, the weakest
level since February 28.  Five-year government bonds rose. The yield on the 4.262
percent notes due September 2016 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.20 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
