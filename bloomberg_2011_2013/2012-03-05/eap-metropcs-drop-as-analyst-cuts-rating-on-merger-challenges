Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP)  and
 MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  fell after Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co. cut its recommendation for the stocks, saying any takeover
bids for the carriers would be “fraught with challenges.”  Leap dropped 7.5 percent to $9.76 at the close in New York
and MetroPCS slid 5.7 percent to $9.96. After gains in recent
months, any takeover prospects are “in the stocks,”
Bernstein’s Craig Moffett said in a note to clients today. The
analyst cut his rating for each stock to “market perform” from
“outperform.”  Verizon Wireless  and  AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. wireless
carriers, might not be permitted by regulators to buy the
smaller rivals, Moffett said. The No. 3 carrier  Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S) , which abandoned plans to buy MetroPCS, and  T-Mobile USA ,
the No. 4, are in “challenging financial situations,” Moffett
said.  Even as Richardson, Texas-based MetroPCS and San Diego-
based Leap remain viable targets for larger carriers, “it’s
time to take the chips off the table,” Moffett said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
