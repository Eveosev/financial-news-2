Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) ,  East Africa ’s
biggest mobile-phone operator, jumped the most in six months on
speculation lower rates for money transfer will boost usage.  The stock climbed 5 percent to 3.2 shillings by the close
in Nairobi, the capital, posting its largest one-day advance
since Sept. 7.  The company cut the charge to send between 101 shillings
($1.22) and 500 shillings over its M-Pesa mobile phone money-
transfer service to 25 shillings, from 30 shillings, Nairobi-
based  Business Daily  said March 2. Transfers of 10 shillings to
50 shillings will cost 3 shillings, while previously users were
unable to send any amount less than 50 shillings, it said.  “It will make more economic sense, especially for the very
poor, to make these types of money transfer transactions,” Eric
Musau, research analyst with Standard Investment Bank Ltd. in
Nairobi, said by phone. “This could increase the revenue per
user and make Safaricom more profitable. M-Pesa is already
outperforming the data and voice segments of the company.”  In  Kenya , where 45.9 percent of people live in poverty on
less than $1.25 per day, the  African Development Bank  said in a
report last month that M-Pesa has brought more than 14 million
customers into “virtual” banking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
