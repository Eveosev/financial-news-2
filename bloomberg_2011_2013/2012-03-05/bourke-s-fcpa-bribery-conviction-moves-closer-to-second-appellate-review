A federal appeals court told U.S.
prosecutors to respond to a request by Frederic Bourke, a
Connecticut businessman who was found guilty of bribery, that
the judges reconsider a ruling upholding his conviction.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Manhattan in December upheld
Bourke’s 2009 conviction, saying there was enough evidence to
find that he knew of the bribery scheme or took steps to avoid
learning about it. In January, defense lawyer Michael Tigar
asked the full appeals court to hear the case again. The appeals
court on March 1 ordered prosecutors to respond to the request.  The order is an encouraging sign for Bourke. Under court
rules, appellate judges ordinarily won’t agree to rehear a case
without soliciting a response from the winning party. Tigar
declined to comment on the order, as did Carly Sullivan, a
spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in  New York .  Bourke, who remains free on bail, was convicted by a
 Manhattan  jury of conspiring to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act by joining a scheme to bribe government leaders in
 Azerbaijan  as part of an oil deal. Bourke, 65, was sentenced to
a year in prison.  The Bourke case is U.S. v. Bourke, 05-cr-00518, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
appeal is U.S. v. Kozeny, 09-4704, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
