Nigeria ’s naira weakened for the
first time in three days as oil importers increased demand for
dollars after the government promised to refund retailers for
selling at subsidized rates.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer depreciated
by 0.1 percent to 157.72 per dollar as of 3:20 p.m. in Lagos,
the commercial capital. Nigeria sold $150 million at a foreign-
currency auction today, with lenders buying the entire amount on
offer, the Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said in an e-
mailed statement. The marginal rate, which is also used as the
prevailing exchange rate depreciated 0.1 percent to 156.01
naira, compared with 155.90 at the previous sale on Feb. 29, it
said.  “We expect the demand for dollars to mount pressure on
naira” following the removal of uncertainty on subsidy payments
to fuel importers and “the likely increase in credit facilities
from banks for oil imports,” analysts at Lagos-based Cowry
Asset Management Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed note to clients
today.  Fuel retailers resumed imports after a government assurance
they will receive refunds for selling at subsidized prices, the
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said Feb. 23.
Nigeria is revising the 2012 budget to include 888 billion naira
($5.6 billion) in fuel subsidies, the  Finance Ministry  said in a
statement on Feb. 16. President Goodluck Jonathan backed out of
a plan to fully remove fuel subsidies after gasoline prices more
than doubled, sparking a strike by labor unions.  The regulator kept its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged at
a record high for a second consecutive meeting on Jan. 31 to
stabilize prices.  Inflation (NGCPIYOY)  in the West African nation
accelerated to 12.6 percent in January from 10.3 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated for a fourth day, dropping 0.5
percent to 1.7150 per dollar, as of 3:20 p.m. in Accra, the
nation’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
