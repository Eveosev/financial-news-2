Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) , the No. 1
U.S. publisher of video games, won dismissal of one of two fraud
claims in its litigation against the former heads of its
Infinity Ward studio, whom the company fired in 2010.  State Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle in  Los Angeles 
agreed today with Activision that a fraudulent-inducement claim
made by Jason West and Vincent Zampella, creators of the
blockbuster game  “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,”  shouldn’t
go forward. He let stand a claim for promissory fraud.  West and Zampella said that they were considering leaving
Activision when their contracts expired in October 2008. They
alleged that Activision made false promises to string them along
and create “Modern Warfare 2,” which became the bestselling
game of 2010, before firing them.  The former executives added the claims to a 2010 lawsuit in
which they alleged that Activision, based in  Santa Monica ,
 California , fired them to avoid paying millions of dollars in
royalties for the game.  Activision maintains they were fired because they were in
secret talks with rival Electronic Arts Inc. to set up a new
development studio.  In a December 2010 cross-complaint, Activision asked for
$400 million in damages from Electronic Arts for interfering
with the contracts of its employees.  A trial on all remaining claims is scheduled for May 7.  The case is West v. Activision, SC107041, California
Superior Court (Los Angeles County).  To contact the reporter on this story:
