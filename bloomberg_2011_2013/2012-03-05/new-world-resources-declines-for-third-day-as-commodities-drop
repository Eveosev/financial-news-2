New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech coking-coal producer, fell for a third day as commodities
and mining stocks tumbled after  China  cut its economic growth
target for this year.  The stock dropped 2.3 percent to 153.4 koruna by 10:34 a.m.
in Prague, adding to a 1 percent retreat in the previous two
days. NWR underperformed the 14-member  PX (PX)  gauge, which declined
0.8 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
