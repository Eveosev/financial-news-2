New Zealand ’s budget deficit was
NZ$473 million ($388 million) wider than forecast in the seven
months through January after higher-than-expected earthquake
insurance liabilities, a report today showed.  The government’s operating deficit before gains and losses
on investments was NZ$4.314 billion in the seven months ended
Jan. 31, compared with the NZ$3.841 billion gap forecast in the
pre-election fiscal update published in October, the Treasury
Department said in a report released in Wellington.  Prime Minister John Key is forecasting the government will
eliminate the shortfall by 2015 as it cuts spending and reduces
debt by selling as much as 49 percent of four state-owned energy
companies. Last month, the government said the 2015 surplus may
be a third the size it predicted in October as weaker world
growth curbs revenue.  “Returning to surplus won’t be easy,” Finance Minister
 Bill English  said in a statement after the report was published.
“But it is one of the most important things the government can
do to ensure New Zealand can withstand future shocks and build a
more competitive economy based on exports and new jobs.”  The state’s earthquake-related insurance costs were NZ$290
million higher than forecast for the seven months, according to
the report. That was a result of continued earthquakes and
aftershocks in the Canterbury region, with damage caused by a
Dec. 23 temblor estimated at NZ$300 million.  Core crown tax revenue was NZ$946 million below forecast,
partly due to weaker labor market conditions, English said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
