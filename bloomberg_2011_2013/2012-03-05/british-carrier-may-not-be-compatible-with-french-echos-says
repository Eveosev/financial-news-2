The British military may abandon
plans to build aircraft carriers compatible with those of the
French navy because the U.K. may change the type of launch
system,  Les Echos  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Cost overruns on  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 fighter could
lead the U.K. to abandon a catapult-launch version of the plane
for the planned “Prince of  Wales ” carrier -- the same launch
system in use on  France ’s “Charles de Gaulle” carrier. A
decision will be taken before Easter, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
