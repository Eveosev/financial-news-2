OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
will probably start natural gas production from the first deep-
water well in the  Black Sea  as early as 2015, Romanian President
Traian Basescu said today, after visiting the drilling rig,
according to  Mediafax .  The two companies, which said on Feb. 22 they may have
encountered a gas accumulation of as much as 84 billion cubic
meters in the Black Sea, will explore new wells “with similar
prospects,” in the Neptun Block in the “coming time period,”
Basescu told reporters in Constanta today, the news service
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
