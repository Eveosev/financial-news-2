Highfields Capital Management LP,
the $11 billion investment firm run by Jonathon S. Jacobson,
urged  CoreLogic Inc. (CLGX)  to consider more independent candidates for
its board of directors.  “The board requires new skills, perspectives and emphasis
on accountability that can only come from a substantial change
in its composition,” Jacobson and Managing Director Farhad Nanji said in a letter today sent to D. Van Skilling,
CoreLogic’s chairman. “We know several high quality candidates
who fit that bill, and we expect that other shareholders do as
well.”  CoreLogic, which sells property and credit data, said on
Feb. 27 that its board voted to end a strategic review started
in August to explore options including a sale or merger of the
company and divestiture of some of its businesses. The following
day, Highfields called for a management change, saying the  Santa
Ana , California-based company failed to meet promises on
monitoring management’s progress on its latest operating plan.  Highfields said CoreLogic in the past failed to take steps
to add independent directors, consider candidates or contact
other shareholders for nominations. The Boston-based hedge fund
owns a 7.7 percent stake in CoreLogic, making it the largest
shareholder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Neither the company nor its stakeholders will be properly
served by a board that continues to be dominated by hand-picked
legacy directors without these skills, or by cosmetic changes of
the sort begrudgingly made in the past,” Jacobson and Nanji
said in today’s letter.  ‘Reluctantly and Belatedly’  Alyson Austin, a CoreLogic spokeswoman, didn’t return a
telephone call seeking comment.  Highfields said it had privately urged CoreLogic a year ago
to address conflicts and potential antitrust violations inherent
in Parker S. Kennedy’s role as executive chairman of both
CoreLogic and Santa Ana-based First American Corp. CoreLogic
acknowledged such interests in a June 2010 filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  CoreLogic was created in 2010 when First American split
into two companies. First American owned 5.6 percent of
CoreLogic as of Nov. 7, making it the second-largest
shareholder, data compiled by Bloomberg show. CoreLogic competes
with First American in some of its businesses such as operating
real estate databases, according to a 2010  SEC filing .  Highfields said that Kennedy stepped down from CoreLogic
“reluctantly and belatedly” following the departure of two
independent directors who were neither chosen by Kennedy or
Skilling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
