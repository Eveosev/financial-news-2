Shufersal Ltd. (SAE) , Israel’s largest
supermarket chain, dropped to the lowest level since June 2009
after reporting a fourth-quarter decline in same-store sales.  The  shares  retreated 1.8 percent to 12.90 shekels at the
4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, bringing the 12-month decline to 39
percent.  Shufersal and competitor  Alon Holdings Blue Square-Israel
Ltd. (BSI) , the country’s second-largest food retailer, have tumbled
as protests calling for more affordable housing and lower prices
for food and other consumer products curbed the companies’
ability to raise prices. Shufersal said today that fourth-
quarter  revenue  was unchanged at 2.79 billion shekels ($735
million) amid a 4.1 percent decline in same-store sales.  “Concerns still remain regarding growing competition from
smaller chains, further consumer activism,” Gil Dattner, an
analyst at  Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI) , Israel’s largest bank by
assets, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Alon Holdings  shares , which have declined 61 percent in the
past 12 months, were unchanged at 13.20 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
