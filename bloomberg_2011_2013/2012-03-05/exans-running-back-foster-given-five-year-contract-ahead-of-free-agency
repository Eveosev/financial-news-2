Arian Foster , who led the  National
Football League  in rushing in 2010, agreed on a five-year
contract with the Houston Texans, according to his agent.  The 25-year-old Pro Bowl running back will remain in
Houston, where he has spent his three-year career, agent Mike McCartney said today on his Twitter page. Financial details
weren’t disclosed.  Texans spokesman Kevin Cooper said in an e-mail that the
team had nothing to announce.  Foster signed with the Texans as an undrafted free agent in
2009 and, after being cut and re-signed, played six games in his
rookie season. In 2010, he ran for a league-high 1,616 yards and
16 touchdowns, making the  Pro Bowl  for the first time.  In 13 games last season, Foster rushed for 1,224 yards and
10 touchdowns, helping the Texans to the franchise’s first
playoff victory, 31-10 over the  Cincinnati Bengals . He also
caught 53 passes for two touchdowns and was chosen for his
second Pro Bowl.  Foster was set to become a free agent on March 13. The
deadline for NFL teams to use their franchise tag on pending
free agents is today at 4 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
