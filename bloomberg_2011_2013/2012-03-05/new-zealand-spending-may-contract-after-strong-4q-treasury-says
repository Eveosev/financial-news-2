New Zealand  consumer spending could
contract in the first quarter as the nation “catches its
breath” after strong domestic demand in the final three months
last year, the  Treasury Department  said.  Consumer activity is adjusting after the Rugby  World Cup 
and stores reopening in earthquake-damaged Christchurch boosted
fourth-quarter spending, the department said in a report on its
website today. Fourth-quarter private consumption may have
increased 1 percent, more than twice the pace the Treasury
expected, and first-quarter spending may decline, it said.  Economic growth will slow in early 2012 and accelerate
later in the year and into 2013 as rebuilding homes and
infrastructure gets under way, the Treasury said. In February,
it forecast gross domestic product will grow 2.8 percent in the
year ending March 31, 2013, and today it said that forecast
remains in place.  Delays in Christchurch reconstruction “suggest underlying
weakness in the labor market will remain a feature until
rebuilding activity gathers pace in 2013,” it said.  Growth in 2012 will be slower than predicted last year
because of the stalled rebuild and ongoing risks to the global
economy emanating from  Europe , the Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
