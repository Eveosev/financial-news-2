The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  slipped a second day, dropping 0.1
percent to 703.43 at 4 p.m. in New York, after  China , the
world’s biggest metals consumer, cut the nation’s economic
growth target. Metals and gas led the decline.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices dropped 0.6
percent to 1,638.09.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures tumbled to a six-week low in New York
as forecasts of above-normal temperatures across the continental
U.S. signaled reduced demand for the heating fuel.  Gas, the worst performer this year in the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Spot Index, fell as much as 5.4 percent. Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, said temperatures may exceed 70
degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) in the mid-Atlantic and southern
Midwest in the next two weeks. Gas supplies were 45 percent
above the five-year average in the week ended Feb. 24.  Natural gas for April delivery fell 12.9 cents, or 5.2
percent, to settle at $2.355 per million British thermal units
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement price
since Jan. 20.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined for the second straight session after China
announced the lowest economic growth target in seven years,
curbing prospects for commodity demand and global growth.  Gold futures for April delivery fell 0.3 percent to settle
at $1,703.90 an ounce at 2:04 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices dropped 3.7 percent last week, the most since Dec. 16,
while the dollar gained 1.3 percent against a six-currency
basket.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 2.4 percent to $33.695
an ounce. It’s the best-performing precious metal this year with
a gain of 21 percent.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery declined 1.7 percent to $1,662.60 an ounce. The
metal dropped 1.4 percent last week. Palladium futures for June
delivery decreased 0.8 percent to $706.95 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper fell the most in two weeks on concern that demand
will slow after China, the world’s biggest metals consumer, cut
its economic-growth targets.  The metal also fell on forecasts that automobile sales in
China in the two months ended Feb. 29 are heading for the
biggest decline in seven years after gasoline costs climbed to a
record.  China “is not growing quite as fast as it was, and that’s
taking some of the steam out of the market,” William O’ Neill,
a partner at Logic Advisors in  Upper Saddle River ,  New Jersey ,
said in a telephone interview. “People are concerned about the
level of Chinese inventories.”  Copper futures for May delivery slid 1.1 percent to settle
at $3.8595 a pound at 1:14 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the
biggest loss since Feb. 17. The metal has gained 12 percent this
year.  Nickel, zinc, lead, aluminum and tin also slid in London.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn futures rose to the highest price in almost four
months on speculation that China will increase imports from the
U.S., the world’s biggest shipper. Soybeans declined.  China should reform its corn-import system by dropping
quotas for shipments or raising the amount that buyers are
permitted to purchase, said Liu Yonghao, the chairman of New
Hope Group Co., the nation’s top maker of livestock feed. U.S.
grain delivered to China, including import duties and taxes,
trades at a discount to domestic prices in southern ports, data
from Shanghai JC Intelligence show.  Corn futures for May delivery gained 0.9 percent to close
at $6.6075 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price reached $6.6525, the highest for a most-
active contract since Nov. 9.  Soybean futures for May delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$13.25 a bushel in Chicago, snapping a 10-session rally, the
longest since July. Earlier, the most-active contract touched
$13.365, the highest since Sept. 21.  Wheat futures fell from a one-month high on speculation
that rains this week in the U.S. Great Plains will improve the
prospects of winter crops emerging from dormancy this month.  Areas of the Plains may get as much as 1.5 inches (3.8
centimeters) of precipitation through March 9, QT Weather said.
The crop in  Kansas , the biggest U.S. winter-wheat grower, was
rated 52 percent good to excellent as of Feb. 27, up from 49
percent a month earlier, government data show. Parts of southern
Kansas still suffer from dry conditions after months of below-
normal rain, University of  Nebraska  at Lincoln data show.  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 0.4 percent to $6.72 a
bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the
price reached $6.7775, the highest for a most-active contract
since Feb. 1.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil rose along with Brent crude and European gasoil
as President  Barack Obama  and Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin
Netanyahu  discuss how to confront  Iran  over its nuclear program.  Futures gained as Obama, while asking  Israel  to help dial
back “too much loose talk of war,” said he takes “no options
off the table” including a military effort to stop Iran from
having a nuclear weapon. Prices have been boosted by concern
that tension over Iran’s nuclear research program, which has
drawn sanctions, would escalate and disrupt production.  April-delivery heating oil gained 1.56 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $3.2174 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , after falling 3.4 percent last week. Prices
are up 9.6 percent this year.  Gasoline slipped as equities fell after U.S. factory orders
sank and China cut its economic growth outlook, raising concern
about the global economy and fuel demand. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index fell 0.4 percent at 3:18 p.m. in New York.  Gasoline for April delivery sank 1.41 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $3.258 a gallon on the exchange, after
fluctuating between $3.2936 and $3.2475. Prices have gained 21
percent this year.  Gasoline’s premium to heating oil narrowed to 4.06 cents
from 7.03 cents on March 2.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa, sugar and coffee futures fell on speculation that
slowing economies in nations including China will dent demand.  China cut its annual target for economic growth to 7.5
percent from the 8 percent goal in place since 2005.  Europe ’s
output from services and manufacturing in February was less than
estimated on Feb. 22. Cocoa has tumbled 38 percent in the past
year, coffee has declined 26 percent and sugar has fallen 17
percent.  “China is on the demand side of everything,”  Michael
Smith , the president of T&K Futures and Options Inc. in  Port St.
Lucie ,  Florida , said in a telephone interview. “The news out of
China is adding downward pressure.”  Cocoa for May delivery dropped 2.2 percent to settle at
$2,283 a metric ton at 12:07 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Feb. 23.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery declined 1.1 percent to
24.68 cents a pound.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery fell less than 0.1
percent to $2.017 a pound.  In  London  futures trading, cocoa, robusta coffee and
refined sugar declined on NYSE Liffe.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures fell the most in three months and hogs
declined on speculation that U.S. meat demand will slow as
higher gasoline prices trim consumer budgets.  Wholesale beef slid for a second straight day on March 2,
while wholesale pork dropped 0.7 percent last week, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. The national average
gasoline price climbed to $3.767 a gallon yesterday, the highest
since June, according to the American Automobile Association.  “Gas costs are an issue for meat pricing as a whole,”
 Rich Nelson , the director of research at Allendale Inc. in
McHenry, Illinois, said in a telephone interview. “That’s been
a big concern for us in the past two weeks.”  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 1.2 percent to
settle at $1.284 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, capping the biggest drop since Dec. 5. Prices have
still climbed 5.7 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for April settlement dropped 1.5
percent to $1.5895 a pound. On March 2, the commodity rose to a
record $1.6205.  Hog futures for April settlement slid 1.1 percent to 89.425
cents a pound. The commodity has gained 6.1 percent this year.  CRUDE OIL  Oil edged higher as U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met to discuss how to confront
Iran over its nuclear program and as China cut its economic
growth target.  Futures posted the smallest move in 10 months after Obama
said that “all options” are available to prevent a nuclear-
armed Iran in a meeting with Netanyahu today at the White House.
Prices fell as much as 1.1 percent earlier as China’s Premier
 Wen Jiabao  said his country will aim for expansion of 7.5
percent this year, the lowest goal since 2004.  Oil for April delivery rose 2 cents to settle at $106.72 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the smallest
one-day move since April 25. Prices are up 2.2 percent in the
past year.  Brent oil for April settlement increased 15 cents to
$123.80 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London. The European benchmark’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate futures widened to $17.08 a barrel from last week’s
close of $16.95.  Wen announced China’s GDP goal while delivering a state-of-
the-nation speech to about 3,000 lawmakers at the annual meeting
of the National People’s Congress in Beijing today. The growth
target matched the median forecast of 15 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
