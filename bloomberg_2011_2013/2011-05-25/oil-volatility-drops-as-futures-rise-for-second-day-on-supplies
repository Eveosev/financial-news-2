Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures rose for a second day, reaching a two-week
high after a report showed that U.S. distillate fuel supplies
hit the lowest level in two years and consumption increased.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 32.5 percent as of 2 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 32.9 percent yesterday.  Crude for July delivery gained $1.73, or 1.7 percent, to
$101.32 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since May 10. Prices have climbed 47 percent
in the past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
July $90 puts, with 3,055 lots changing hands. They lost 16
cents to 49 cents a barrel. August $85 puts, the next-most
active option, dropped 15 cents to 72 cents a barrel with 1,970
lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  August $115 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 3,854 lots changing hands. They rose 11 cents to
86 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, July $100
calls, gained 57 cents to $3.07 a barrel on volume of 3,729
lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
46,330 contracts. Next were December 2011 $120 calls with 43,712
and December 2011 $100 calls with 37,221.  To contact the reporter on this story:
