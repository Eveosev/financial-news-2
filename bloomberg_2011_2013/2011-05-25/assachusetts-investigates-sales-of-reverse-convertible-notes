Massachusetts is investigating sales
of structured notes known as reverse convertibles, said Brian McNiff, a spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office. McNiff
declined to comment further.  State regulators are seeing an “influx of concerns and
complaints” about structured products, particularly so-called
principal-protected notes and reverse convertibles, Joseph Borg,
director of the Alabama Securities Commission, said in an
interview earlier this year. Brokers who sell the investments
sometimes don’t understand them, said Borg, a former North
American Securities Administrators Association president.  Reverse convertibles pay set interest rates that are
generally higher than those of corporate bonds. The risk lies in
an embedded option that gives the issuer the right to repay
investors with shares if the underlying stock plummets.  Demos, a New York-based public policy research group, and
the Nation Institute, a nonprofit publishing group, earlier
reported the investigation in a joint study released last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
