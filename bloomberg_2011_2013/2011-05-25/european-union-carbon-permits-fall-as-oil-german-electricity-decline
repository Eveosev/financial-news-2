European Union carbon permits erased
losses as crude oil jumped.  EU allowances for December rose 2 cents to close at 16.38
euros ($23.09) a metric ton after earlier falling as much as 1.2
percent on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in  London .  Brent crude for June delivery advanced 1.7 percent to
$114.48 a barrel on ICE after falling as much as 1.2 percent
earlier today. Crude climbed after a report showed that U.S.
inventories of distillate fuel, a category that includes diesel
and heating oil, tumbled to the lowest level in more than two
years as consumption rose.  Crude can influence carbon permits because itâ€™s linked to
economic output and cleaner-burning natural gas in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
