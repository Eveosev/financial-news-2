U.K. mortgage approvals fell in
April, the British Bankers’ Association said.  The number of mortgages granted to homebuyers declined to
29,355 from 31,205 in March, the London-based group said in an
e-mailed statement today.  “Individuals and businesses continue to save more, pay off
debt and borrow less as uncertainty about the economy has
entrenched a ‘wait and see’ attitude,” BBA Statistics Director
David Dooks said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
