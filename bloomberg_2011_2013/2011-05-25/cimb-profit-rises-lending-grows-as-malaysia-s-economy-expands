CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) ,  Malaysia ’s
second-biggest lender, said first-quarter profit rose 9.4
percent as lending grew with the Southeast Asian’s expanding
economy.  Net income increased to 916.5 million ringgit ($299
million), or 12.33 sen per share, in the three months ended
March 31 from 838.1 million ringgit, or 11.86 sen per share, a
year earlier, the Kuala Lumpur-based company said in an exchange
filing late yesterday. Revenue slid 1.3 percent to 2.75 billion
ringgit.  “We had a good start to 2011,” Chief Executive Officer
Nazir Razak said in a separate statement. “It was driven by our
consumer bank operations across the region. The investment
banking pipeline for the rest of the year is good.”  CIMB joins other Malaysian lenders including  Malayan
Banking Bhd. (MAY)  and  Public Bank Bhd. (PBK)  in reporting higher profit in
the quarter after the country’s economy grew at the fastest pace
in a decade last year, spurring demand for loans. The central
bank has raised  interest rates  four times since March 2010 to
contain inflation.  The bank’s shares have fallen 2.7 percent this year after
gaining 26 percent in the past 12 months. In comparison, the
benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index has gained 1 percent
this year. CIMB rose 0.5 percent to close at 8.27 ringgit
yesterday ahead of its earnings announcement.  Loans Growth  Total loans grew 13.8 percent from a year earlier, driven
by demand in Malaysia and  Indonesia , CIMB said. Net interest
income, or revenue from borrowers after deducting interest paid
to depositors, dropped 0.6 percent to 1.59 billion ringgit in
the quarter through March, it said.  The central bank has boosted interest rates to curb
inflation, which accelerated to a 23-month high in March. It
last raised the benchmark overnight policy rate to 3 percent
from 2.75 percent on May 5.  The Southeast Asian economy is on course to meet the
government’s forecast growth of between 5 percent and 6 percent
this year even as first-quarter expansion came in below the
projected range, Second Finance Minister Ahmad Husni Mohamad Hanadzlah said May 19.  Allowances for impairment losses on loans fell 96 percent
to 6.2 million ringgit from 149.8 million ringgit a year earlier,
said CIMB. Net non-interest income dropped 14 percent to 815.8
million ringgit in the first quarter from a year earlier, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
