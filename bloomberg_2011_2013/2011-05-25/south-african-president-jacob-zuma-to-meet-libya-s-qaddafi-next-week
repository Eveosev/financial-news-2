South African President  Jacob Zuma 
will travel to Libya next week to meet  Muammar Qaddafi  and
revive African Union efforts to halt the country’s civil war,
the presidency said.  Zuma’s trip seeks to secure an “immediate cessation of all
hostilities,” humanitarian help for civilians, guarantees on
the protection of foreigners, and a plan for political reforms,
which would pave the way for a lasting peace, Zuma’s office said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Johannesburg-based  702 Talk Radio  reported today that Zuma
will discuss an exit strategy with Qaddafi, without saying where
it got the information.  “Speculation that the visit is to discuss an ‘exit
strategy’ is misleading,” the presidency said.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is continuing air
strikes against forces loyal to Qaddafi, while rebels battle his
troops in a bid to end his four-decade rule. Zuma last month led
a failed AU mission to Tripoli,  Libya ’s capital, to push for
peace.  South Africa ’s ruling African National Congress on May 20
said it was “gravely incensed by the senseless and
indiscriminate use of deadly force against innocent civilians
and members of the media by the Libyan government” after
learning of the death of South African photographer Anton
Hammerl while covering the conflict.  Libya had given South Africa assurances that Hammerl was
alive in custody, raising hopes of his family and friends,
“only to be crushed later,” the ANC said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
