Nigeria’s legislature approved an
amended 2011 budget, slashing almost 500 billion naira ($3.2
billion) off the spending plans passed two months earlier.  The 4.5 trillion-naira budget includes 2.43 trillion naira
for recurrent spending and 1.15 trillion for investment, Senate
President David Mark said in parliament today in the capital,
Abuja. That compares with 2.47 trillion naira for recurrent
spending and 1.56 trillion naira for capital projects in the
budget approved on March 16.  Parliament had agreed to debate the budget again after
President Goodluck Jonathan rejected their spending proposals.
Jonathan originally presented a budget of 4.22 billion naira,
with investment focused on infrastructure projects, including
power and railways, to create employment in  Africa ’s most
populous nation. Parliament said that was too little. Jonathan
still needs to sign the latest budget into law.  Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest economy after  South
Africa  should expand 7.98 percent in 2011, up from 7.85 percent
last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
