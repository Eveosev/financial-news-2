Cushing MLP Total Return Fund (SRV) , a
closed-end fund that invests in energy partnerships, was halted
for about an hour by the New York Stock Exchange because of
confusion over when investors have to own the security to
collect a dividend.  The so-called ex-dividend date has been set for May 27,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Dan Spears, a money
manager at fund administrator Swank Capital LLC in Dallas, said
there had been “some confusion” about the date.  The fund, which had a market value of $349.7 million as of
yesterday, started trading at 10:30 a.m. in New York today, an
hour after the regular session began. Its top holdings include
 Enbridge Energy Partners LP (EEP) ,  Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP)  and
 MarkWest Energy Partners LP. (MWE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
