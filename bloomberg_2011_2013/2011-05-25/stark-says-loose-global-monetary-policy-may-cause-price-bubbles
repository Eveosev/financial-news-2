European Central Bank Executive Board
member Juergen Stark said it’s important not to underestimate
the risk of low borrowing costs among industrialized nations
sparking asset-price bubbles.  “The biggest challenge on the side of industrialized is to
stabilize public debt and to create the basis for a good and
durable consolidation of public finances,” Stark said at a
conference in Berlin today. Still, “monetary policy that has
remained extremely accommodative over the years threatens to
worsen existing tensions and to create new imbalances.”  The ECB last month raised its benchmark interest rate for
the first time in almost three years as a strengthening economy
and surging commodity costs fueled euro-region inflation. Stark
said loose monetary policy threatens to push up prices on
financial and real-estate markets.  Stark said the global economy is “very far” from a
“sustainable and balanced growth,” following loose monetary
policy in developed countries and the accumulation of “huge”
currency surpluses in emerging markets.  “The ECB has started to withdraw the decisive loosening of
monetary policy that was necessary during the high point of the
crisis,” Stark said. For developed economies, a “gradual
turning away from pure export-orientated growth models through
overcoming structural growth deficits” is needed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
