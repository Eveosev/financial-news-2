Slovensky Plynarensky Priemysel AS,
Slovakia’s largest gas company, wants to invest 400 million
euros ($562 million) to upgrade its transit network and build
new facilities.  The investment, spread over five years, will reduce the
impact of operations on the environment and boost the
reliability of gas transit, spokesman Ondrej Sebesta said in an
e-mailed statement from Bratislava, Slovakia, today.  The utility, which makes most of its revenue from operating
a section of a pipeline transporting Russian gas to the west, is
49 percent-owned by Ruhrgas AG and Gaz de  France , with the
Slovak government holding a majority. Its after-tax profit fell
10 percent last year to 561 million euros and was affected by
the weak economic recovery and price regulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
