Serbia  tightened election regulations
to prevent political parties from replacing deputies who stop
toeing the party line, as part of legislative changes to meet
European Union standards.  The Belgrade-based parliament today approved eliminating
the use of the so-called blank resignations under which people
elected to the national or local assemblies on a party ticket
had to deposit a letter of resignation with their party before
taking office. Some parties used this to replace them swiftly in
case of defection or if they vote contrary to party
instructions.  The Balkan nation hopes to become an official candidate for
EU membership this year and possibly start entry talks with the
bloc. The EU conditions for Serbia include legislative reforms,
suppressing organized crime and corruption and hunting down two
remaining war crimes suspects indicted for their roles in the
1990â€™s Balkan wars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
