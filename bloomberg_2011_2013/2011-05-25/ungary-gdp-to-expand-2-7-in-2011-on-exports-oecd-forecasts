Hungary’s gross domestic product is
expected to expand 2.7 percent this year as exports pick up and
domestic demand gradually improves, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said.  The economy may grow 3.1 percent next year, the OECD said
in its May 2011 Economic Outlook released today. Consumer prices
are forecast to rise 4 percent this year and 3.3 percent next
year.  Hungary is expected to post a budget surplus of 2.6 percent
of GDP in 2011, after a deficit last year, the Paris-based
organization said. The swing is due to the dismantling of the
country’s second-pillar pension, which will provide one-time
revenue of about 9 percent of GDP, the OECD said. Hungary will
post a 3.3 percent deficit in 2012, the Paris-based organization
estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
