Japanese  stock futures  rose after oil
and copper prices increased and as the yen weakened.  Australian
stocks futures advanced.  American depositary receipts of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s
largest trading company, gained 0.4 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest
camera maker, jumped 2.5 percent on its plan to buy back shares.
ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company,
climbed 1.8 percent after Deutsche Bank AG upgraded basic
resources to “overweight” and named BHP among its top picks.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,480 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,410
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,480 in
 Osaka , at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 0.9 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
was little changed in Wellington.  “Rising commodities reduce concern that the stock market
driven by liquidity will falter,” said Mitsushige Akino, who
oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “However, with increasing economic reports
showing deterioration in the U.S., anxiety the economy will slow
down will likely limit gains in stocks.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In New York, the index gained 0.3 percent to
1,320.47 yesterday as commodity shares rallied on expectations
for higher raw material prices.  Crude oil for July delivery rose 1.7 percent to $101.32 a
barrel in  New York  yesterday, the highest settlement since May
10, as a report showed that U.S. distillate fuel supplies
dropped to a two-year low. Copper futures for July delivery
jumped 2.3 percent in New York yesterday, the biggest gain since
May 18, as Deutsche Bank AG said prices probably will climb.  A report showed that orders for durable goods dropped　more
than forecast in April in the U.S., reflecting less demand for
aircraft　and disruptions in supplies of auto parts stemming
from the　earthquake in Japan.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 4.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5 percent by the S&P
500 and 0.6 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.3 times for the S&P 500 and 11.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  The yen depreciated to 115.49 against the euro, compared
with 114.86 at the close of  stock trading  in  Tokyo  yesterday.
Against the dollar, Japan’s currency weakened to 82.09 from
81.83. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Canon said it plans to buy back as much as 1.2 percent of
its total shares　for up to 50 billion yen ($611 million).  To contact the reporters on this story:
