OAO RusHydro,  Russia ’s biggest
producer of renewable energy, held talks with China Yangtze
Power Co. and Italy’s  Enel SpA (ENEL)  to sell a 7.9 percent stake,
Kommersant reported.  The company also had negotiations with  Spain ’s  Iberdrola
SA (IBE) ,  France ’s Electricite de France and China State Grid Corp. as
the government prepares to sell the stake in RusHydro in 2013,
the Russian newspaper reported, citing a company official with
knowledge of the matter. RusHydro is expected to make a decision
on the sale in the first half of 2012, according to Kommersant.  Enel is not interested in acquiring the stake, a
spokeswoman for the Rome-based utility, who declined to be
identified citing corporate policy, told Bloomberg by phone,
confirming an earlier comment to Kommersant. The other potential
bidders declined to comment, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Denis Maternovsky at   dmaternovsky@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
