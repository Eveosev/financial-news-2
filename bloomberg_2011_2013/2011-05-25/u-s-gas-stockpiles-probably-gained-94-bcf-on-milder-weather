U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
rose 4.9 percent last week, below the seasonal average, as cold
weather sparked late-season heating demand in the North,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories rose 94 billion cubic feet to 2.013 trillion in
the week ended May 20, based on the median of 14 estimates. The
five-year average stockpile increase for the week is 95 billion,
according to Energy Department data. Supplies climbed 100
billion cubic feet a year earlier.  Colder-than-normal weather in the Midwest and Northeast
last week boosted furnace use and gas consumption. The low in
 Chicago  was 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 Celsius) May 17, 9 degrees
below normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. The low in  New York 
touched 52 degrees, 3 below normal.  “The weather data is hinting towards a colder-than-normal
week for last week than we’ve seen in past years,” said Eric Bickel, a commodity analyst with Summit Energy in Louisville,
 Kentucky . “Heating degree days were 40 percent higher across
the U.S. than what the norm is.”  Heating degree days, calculated by subtracting the daily
average temperature from a base of 65 degrees, are designed to
show energy demand. Higher values mean cooler weather and more
energy being used to heat homes and business.  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 85 billion
to 101 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department is scheduled to
release its weekly report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Gas drilling rigs fell by 8 to 866 last week, the lowest
level since the week ended Jan. 29, 2010, according to data from
Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. The rig count has dropped 13
percent from a 2010 high of 992 on Aug. 13.  Nuclear Power  U.S. nuclear-power production rose May 19 after reactors in
 Massachusetts  and New York state started up. Power generation
nationwide climbed to 79,067 megawatts, or 78 percent of
capacity, the most since April 2, according to a Nuclear
Regulatory Commission report and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Rising nuclear output can crimp gas demand from  power plants .  Nuclear units typically shut for refueling and maintenance
in the spring and fall, when power demand is lowest. Nuclear
power output nationwide fell to 68,248 megawatts on May 2, the
smallest amount since May 10, 1999.  Gas stockpiles rose 92 billion cubic feet to 1.919 trillion
in the week ended May 13, the Energy Department reported last
week. Analysts expected an increase of 90 billion.  Gas on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell 0.4 percent
last week to $4.23 per million British thermal units. Prices
rose 3.7 cents or 0.9 percent, to $4.382 at 12:14 p.m. today on
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
