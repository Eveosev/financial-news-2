European jet fuel prices rose as ash
from Iceland’s Grimsvotn volcano started to disperse and the
country’s prime minister said “the worst is over.”  Jet fuel swaps advanced as much as 0.6 percent as airports
in northern  Germany  began to reopen. More than 700 flights may
be canceled today out of the 29,000 operated daily, according to
Eurocontrol, which oversees air traffic in the region.  “The eruption is waning day by day and problems arising
in our neighboring countries as a result of volcanic ash should
be resolved quickly,” Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir said today in a statement.  The June swap contract for jet fuel cargoes climbed to a
high of $1,020.47 a metric ton, the most since May 23, when
Iceland was forced to shut its main airport at Keflavik,
according to Bloomberg data. It was up $4.91, or 0.5 percent, at
$1,019.72 a ton as of 12:18 p.m. London time.  Consumption of the fuel plunged last April as the eruption
of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano closed European airspace
for six days, grounding 100,000 flights. The canceled flights
cost the industry $1.8 billion, the  International Air Transport
Association  said in June.  “Last year’s experience showed that the ultimate impact on
jet fuel consumption was fairly limited,” Vienna-based analysts
led by  David Wech  at JBC Energy GmbH said in a note. “Airspace
closure will be implemented less aggressively on the pressure of
airlines and the lack of negative experiences with ash.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
