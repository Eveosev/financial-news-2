U.S. Gulf oil grades strengthened as
the spread between the West Texas Intermediate and Brent
widened, increasing the value of low-sulfur grades from the  Gulf
Coast .  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for July
delivery increased 67 cents to $13.61 a barrel. The differential
for the contract nearest to expiration reached a record $15.94
on Feb. 16.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained $1.40 to $15.85 over
WTI at 1:58 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI strengthened
45 cents to $14.75 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 50 cents to $9 a barrel, and Poseidon increased 65
cents to $8.50 over WTI.  Thunder Horse rose 60 cents to $13 a barrel over WTI, and
Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened 10 cents to $7.50 a
barrel.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount widened 5 cents to $2.60 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude weakened 75 cents to $9.50 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 10 cents to
$17.35 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
