Thailand ’s baht dropped to its
weakest level in two months after overseas investors reduced
holdings of the nation’s shares ahead of elections on July 3.  Exchange data show global funds sold $183 million more of
Thai equities than they bought in the first two days of this
week, contributing to the currency’s 0.6 percent drop since May
20. About 100 people have been killed following disputes over
the last election in 2007.  “Looking at the history, we have to be a bit cautious
about the Thai markets ahead of the election,” said Minori Uchida, a senior analyst in  Tokyo  at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. “I don’t expect big fund outflows under the current
situation, but some investors may adjust positions to get ready
for some risky scenarios.”  The baht slid 0.2 percent to 30.47 per dollar as of 3:52
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency earlier touched 30.49, the weakest level since March
16. It may weaken to about 31 by the end of June, Uchida said.  Several demonstration leaders charged with terrorism for
their role in anti-government protests last year are running for
the opposition Pheu Thai party led by Yingluck Shinawatra,
fugitive ex-leader Thaksin Shinawatra’s sister.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.48 percent.
The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed
to receive a floating payment, lost two basis points to 3.13
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
