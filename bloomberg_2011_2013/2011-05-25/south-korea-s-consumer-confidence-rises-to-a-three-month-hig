South Korean consumer confidence rose
to a three-month high and inflation expectations held near the
Bank of  Korea ’s 4 percent target ceiling, adding pressure on the
central bank to raise  interest rates .  The sentiment index rose to 104 in May from 100 in April,
the Bank of Korea said in an e-mailed statement in  Seoul  today.
A reading above 100 indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.
The expected inflation rate over the next year was 3.9 percent
from 4 percent, today’s report showed.  The nation’s economic expansion, job growth and costlier
energy prices have stoked inflation pressure, prompting the Bank
of Korea to raise rates by a quarter percentage point each in
January and March to 3 percent. Consumer prices may gain 4.4
percent this month after a 4.2 percent rise in April, according
to a median forecast of four economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. The bank will review the interest rate on June 10.  A sub-index measuring consumers’ views of the economic
outlook rose to 91 in May from 81 in the previous month.  The  consumer confidence  index is based on survey responses
from 2,047 households in 56 cities and was conducted by mail and
telephone between May 13 and May 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
