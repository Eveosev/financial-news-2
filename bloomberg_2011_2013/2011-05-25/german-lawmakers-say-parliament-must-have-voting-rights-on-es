A spokesman for lawmakers from
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party said  Germany ’s parliament must
have the right to vote on aid for over-indebted euro region
countries,  according to  the lower house’s HIB newsletter.  It is absolutely necessary for the Bundestag, the lower
chamber of parliament, to have decision-making powers, HIB cited
the unnamed spokesman for the  Christian Democrats  and its
Christian Social Union sister party as saying today in the
Bundestag’s Economy Committee. It’s not enough for parliament to
be consulted, he said, according to HIB.  The government will make sure that lawmakers can vote on
any aid so as to comply with parliament’s budgetary decision-
making rights, the newsletter cited an unnamed government
representative as saying during the committee meeting.  Merkel’s government insists on the inclusion of private-
creditor participation in the treaty on the future European
Stability Mechanism that will go into effect by July 1, 2013,
HIB cited a government report on the euro region’s sovereign
debt crisis as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
