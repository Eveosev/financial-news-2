Howden Joinery Group Plc (HWDN)  may be a
takeover target for  Travis Perkins Plc (TPK) , Britain’s largest
builders’ merchant, Evolution Securities Ltd. analysts led by
Graham Brown said.  Travis Perkins’s ratio of net debt to earnings before
interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization is forecast to
fall to 1.1 in the 2012 fiscal year from 1.6 times, the analysts
said in the note earlier this month. That will give the
Northampton, England-based company, owner of the Wickes home-
improvement chain, more capacity to buy others, the analysts
said. Travis Perkins’s management said it is “keen to undertake
further deals,” they added.  “Howden Joinery must be on the wish list, and such a
transaction would strategically work well, in our view, possibly
with Howden Joinery branches being located within Travis Perkins
yards,” Evolution said. “Both companies are U.K.-focused," and
London-based Howden’s main business is kitchen products, while
Travis has a "nascent position" in that market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
