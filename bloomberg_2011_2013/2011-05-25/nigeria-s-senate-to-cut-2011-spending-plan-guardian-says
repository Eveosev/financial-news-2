Nigeria’s Senate agreed to cut
budgeted spending for this year by 500 billion naira ($3.2
billion) after the presidency requested a reduction, the
 Guardian  reported, citing chairman of the Senate Committee on
Information and Media, Ayogu Eze.  The Senate passed a 4.97 trillion-naira budget for the 2011
fiscal year on March 16, 17 percent more than President Goodluck
Jonathan had proposed in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
