Brazil’s President  Dilma Rousseff 
ordered a team of ministers to look into ways of reducing
volatility in ethanol prices, including the possibility of
government intervention in the market, the Financial Times
reported, citing Energy Minister Edison Lobao.  The ministers, who include Lobao, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  and Agriculture Minister Wagner Rossi, have 10 days to
prepare a report, the newspaper said.  Although Brazil is the second-biggest ethanol producer
after the U.S., prices have reached their highest levels in five
years in recent weeks, leading many people to switch to more
gasoline-based fuel, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
