The southern Russian port of Tuapse
confirmed receipt of shipments of wheat grown in the country and
 Kazakhstan  totaling 85,000 metric tons.  The first loaded freight cars arrived yesterday, port
spokesman Sergei Povolokin said by e-mail today. Deliveries
amounted to 50,000 tons of Russian wheat and 35,000 tons of
Kazakh grain, he said, without identifying the owners.  Researchers said this week traders were starting to ship
grain to silos, some located in ports, amid expectations  Russia 
may let a ban on grain exports expire as scheduled on July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
