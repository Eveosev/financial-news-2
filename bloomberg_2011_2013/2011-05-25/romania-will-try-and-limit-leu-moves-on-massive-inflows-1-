The Romanian central bank will try
and limit exchange-rate volatility as “probable massive foreign
capital inflows’’ put pressure on the leu to appreciate,
Governor Mugur Isarescu said.  Inflows of capital to  Romania  will force the bank to make
difficult monetary-policy decisions and use “unorthodox
measures’’ to prevent exchange-rate volatility, Isarescu said in
a speech at a seminar in Bucharest today.  The leu has gained 3.6 percent against the euro this year,
the second-best performer in central and eastern  Europe  after
the Serbian dinar, Bloomberg data show. It weakened 0.16 percent
to 4.1280 per euro as of 11:22 a.m. in Bucharest.  “It’s probable that we’ll enter a new era of massive
capital inflows to Romania,” Isarescu said. “A worsening of the
Greek crisis could limit them though. But higher capital inflows
are inevitable. We’ll try to limit the exchange-rate volatility
triggered by these inflows, we’ll try to discourage excessive
volatility.’’  Romania’s current-account deficit narrowed 59 percent in
the first quarter to 634 million euros ($890 million) as foreign
direct investments into the Balkan country fell 22 percent to
379 million euros from 486 million euros in the same period of
2010.  Foreign direct investments in Romania peaked at 9.5 billion
euros in 2008 and tumbled to 3.5 billion euros in 2009 and 2.6
billion euros in 2010.  ‘Certain Cost’  There is a “certain cost” in fighting any appreciation of
the currency if the amount of capital entering the Balkan nation
increases, Isarescu said.  “Capital inflows can lead to exchange-rate appreciation,”
he said. “We lived through an appreciation once, we bought 10
billion euros in 2006 and 2007 and we couldn’t stop the
appreciation, which shows there are certain limits” to fighting
the flow.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei left the benchmark interest
rate unchanged for a 12th consecutive month on May 3 and raised
the inflation rate forecast for the end of the year to 5.1
percent from 3.6 percent.  The inflation rate stood at 8.3 percent in April, the
European Union’s highest. The rate will remain above the central
bank target range of 2 percent to 4 percent until next year, the
bank said.
 The central bank is “reluctant” to use the leu as a tool to
damp inflation, Isarescu said on May 5  To contact the reporters on this story:
