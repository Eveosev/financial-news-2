Viacom Inc. (VIA) , owner of  MTV Networks 
and  Paramount Pictures , increased its quarterly dividend by 67
percent to 25 cents a share, boosting the yearly payment to
Chairman  Sumner Redstone ’s family company to $41 million.  The new dividend will be payable July 1 to shareholders of
record on June 15, New York-based Viacom said today in a
statement. The previous dividend was 15 cents and was projected
to increase to 18 cents, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Viacom is in excellent shape financially and momentum
across our businesses is strong,” Philippe Dauman, chief
executive officer, said in the statement. The action reflects
“the confidence we have in our ability to generate ample free
 cash flow  to support returning greater value to our stockholders
while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest
in the long-term growth of our operations.”  Redstone, who turns 88 in two days, controls Viacom through
his holdings of the company’s voting stock, which represents
less than 10 percent of the total equity.  CBS Corp. (CBS) , Redstone’s
other key holding, voted this month to double its quarterly
dividend to 10 cents a share, increasing the annual payment to
his National Amusements company to about $17 million.  Viacom rose 1 cent to $49.95 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The nonvoting Class B shares have
advanced 26 percent this year. CBS fell 3 cents to $26.33 and
has gained 38 percent.  Dividend Rebound  The dividend gains represent a partial restoration of
income Redstone and other CBS shareholders received before the
2008 U.S. recession and financial crisis. In February 2009, New
York-based CBS cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share
from 27 cents as advertising sales fell and the company faced
bond maturities in 2010.  National Amusements  sold almost $1 billion of stock in both
companies in 2009 to repay loans.  Redstone owns 41.4 million Viacom voting shares, or 80
percent of the voting stock, along with 1,296 nonvoting shares,
according to company regulatory filings. He holds 34.5 million
voting shares of CBS, or 79 percent of that class, and 8.26
million nonvoting shares, filings show.  He also collected more than $35 million in total
compensation from both companies in 2010, filings show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
