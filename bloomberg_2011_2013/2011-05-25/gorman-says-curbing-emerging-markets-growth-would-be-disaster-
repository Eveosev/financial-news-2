Morgan Stanley (MS)  Chief Executive
Officer  James Gorman  said the U.S. shouldn’t fear rapid growth
in emerging markets and that curbing their expansion would hurt
the world economy.  “It would be a disaster for the global economy if they
were to slow down their growth,” Gorman, 52, said yesterday
during the Japan Society’s annual awards dinner in New York.  Morgan Stanley  derived  31 percent of its $31.6 billion in
revenue last year from outside the Americas, compared with 19
percent in 2009. The New York-based firm ranks first this year
in advising on Russian mergers and acquisitions, followed by
rival  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We have to be global,” Gorman said. “The demand for
capital, debt and equity will be explosive over the next 20
years.”  The 21-country MSCI Emerging Markets Index has retreated
2.3 percent this year amid slowing growth in the developed world
and tighter monetary policy in  Brazil , Russia, India and China -
- the so-called BRIC countries. The MSCI BRIC Index is down 4.2
percent in 2011, compared with a 2.8 percent gain in the MSCI
World Index of advanced-country shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
