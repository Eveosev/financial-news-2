Estonia’s economy may expand 5.9
percent this year as increased competitiveness boosts exports,
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.  Gross domestic product is likely to rise 4.7 percent next
year as growth becomes more broad based due to increased
employment, the OECD said in its May 2011 Economic Outlook
released today.  Consumer prices may grow 4.6 percent this year and 3
percent next year, the OECD said. The government’s fiscal
deficit will be about 0.5 percent this year and 1.7 percent next
year, the Paris-based organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
