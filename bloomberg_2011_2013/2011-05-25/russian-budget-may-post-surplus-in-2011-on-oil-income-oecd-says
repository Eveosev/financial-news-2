Russia will probably balance its
budget this year, four years earlier than the government
estimates, as higher-than-expected oil revenue replenishes state
coffers, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said in a report released today.  The  budget surplus  is forecast at 0.2 percent of gross
domestic product this year and 0.3 percent in 2012, the OECD
said in its preliminary economic outlook. Russia ran a deficit
of 4.1 percent last year.  The government expects the budget to remain in deficit
through 2014. The world’s biggest energy supplier has benefitted
from higher commodity prices this year, posting a budget surplus
of 134 billion rubles ($4.7 billion) in the first four months,
equivalent to 0.9 percent of GDP, according to the  Finance
Ministry .  The deficit will probably reach 1 percent to 1.4 percent
this year and may drop below that range if oil prices average
above $105 a barrel, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin told
President  Dmitry Medvedev  on May 23.  Russia’s economy will expand 4.9 percent this year and 4.5
percent in 2012, after 4 percent growth in 2010, the OECD said
in the report.  Inflation will accelerate to an average of 9.4 percent this
year before slowing to 6.4 percent in 2012, according to the
report. Consumer prices rose an average of 6.9 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
