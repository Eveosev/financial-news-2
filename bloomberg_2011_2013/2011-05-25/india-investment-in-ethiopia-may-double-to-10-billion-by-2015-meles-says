Investment by Indian companies in
 Ethiopia  may more than double to $10 billion by 2015, helping
the Horn of Africa nation end its dependence of food aid,
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said.  About 400 Indian firms have invested $4.7 billion, while
trade between the two nations stands at $660 million and should
rise to $1 billion in 2015, Meles told a press conference today
with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.  “I’m convinced these are conservative figures,” Meles
said in Addis Ababa, the capital.  Indian companies are investing in textiles, mining,
leather, agriculture, agro-processing and infrastructure,
according to Meles. Projects include Bangalore-based  Karuturi
Global Ltd. (KARG) ’s development of 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) of
land in the western region of Gambella to grow and process
sugar, rice, palm oil and cereals.  The government may lease the company a further 200,000
hectares if it develops the land by December 2012, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said on May 5.  Critics who accuse foreign companies of land grabbing are
“ill-informed and ill-intentioned,” Meles said. “We have 3
million hectares of unutilized land. We want to use all 3
million. We do not want to admire the virgin beauty of our land
while we starve.”  About 3 million of Ethiopia’s 80 million people are in need
of emergency food assistance, the government said on April 12.
Another 7.8 million people receive food or cash under an aid
program, the  World Food Programme  said on April 28.  India  will also advance $300 million for the rehabilitation
of the Ethio-Djibouti railway line, Singh said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
