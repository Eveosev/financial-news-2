Georgian riot police dispersed
protesters using water cannons and tear gas in the capital,
Tbilisi, early today, after the government warned demonstrators
to vacate the area for a planned military parade.  No injuries were reported in the confrontation, according
to Georgian television. The protest against the regime of
President Mikheil Saakashvili began on May 21.  The Georgian Interior Ministry confirmed today on its
website that the dispersal occurred after midnight, noting that
several participants were detained for resisting police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
