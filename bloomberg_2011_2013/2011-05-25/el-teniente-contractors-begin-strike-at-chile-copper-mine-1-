Contract workers at Codelco’s El
Teniente copper mine in central  Chile  began a strike today over
pay and benefits, a union official said.  The strike has affected activity at the underground mine,
Jorge Pena, a leader of a subcontractor union at the mine, said
by telephone today, without elaborating. While there were some
delays in personnel arriving to the site, output is normal, a
company official briefed on the matter said by phone, declining
to be named citing company policy.  State-owned Codelco is the world’s biggest copper producer.
Contractors disrupted output at El Teniente, located 80
kilometers (50 miles) south of Santiago, in 2008. The mine is
the fourth-largest in Chile, producing 404,000 metric tons last
year, according to data published by state research company
 Cochilco .  BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida, the world’s largest copper
mine, produced 1.09 million tons of Chile’s 5.4 million-ton
total output, according to Cochilco. Codelco’s Chuquicamata
produced 528,000 tons last year, according to the company,
followed by Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi mine
which produced 504,000 tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
