Bill Ackman , the founder of Pershing
Square Capital Management known for investing in companies to
press for changes, said he invested in  Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO) 
because it’s “very reasonably priced” and may be acquired.  Ackman, speaking today at the Ira Sohn Conference in  New
York , said it’s a “passive” stake, meaning he’s not going to
pressure management.  “It’s a good business, it’s done very well for a long
time,” he said. “It’s an attractive LBO transaction,” he
added, using the abbreviation for leveraged buyouts.  Family Dollar, a discount retailer based in Matthews, North
Carolina, has advanced 10 percent to $54.82 in 2011 after more
than doubling during the prior three years. The stock climbed
2.5 percent to $56.19 at 5:15 p.m. New York time in after-hours
trading following Ackman’s announcement.  It rejected a takeover offer from Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund
Management LP in March, saying it “substantially” undervalues
its business, and adopted a defense to discourage unsolicited
offers.  Family Dollar earns a “very attractive return on new
stores,” Ackman said. If the company catches up with its rival
 Dollar General Corp. (DG)  in terms of margins, “you make a lot of
money,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
