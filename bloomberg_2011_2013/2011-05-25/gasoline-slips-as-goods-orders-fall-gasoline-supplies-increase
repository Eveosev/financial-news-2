Gasoline declined for the first time
in four days after reports that U.S. inventories rose last week
and orders for durable goods fell raised concern that fuel
demand may decline.  Futures dropped as bookings for goods meant to last at
least three years fell 3.6 percent in April, the most since
October, a Commerce Department report showed today. An industry-
funded report showed that gasoline stockpiles rose a third
consecutive time last week.  “There’s more concern we’re seeing demand drop a little,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
 Chicago . “The build in supplies is another reason not to be
long on oil or gasoline. The durable goods report is another
sign the manufacturing sector is struggling a bit and the demand
for oil and gasoline will slow.”  Gasoline for June delivery slipped 2.5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.9678 a gallon at 9:41 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  The  American Petroleum Institute  reported that gasoline
stockpiles rose 2.44 million barrels last week and distillate
supplies fell 846,000 barrels.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. today in  Washington .  Gasoline stockpiles probably rose 450,000 barrels,
according to the median estimate of 14 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg News. Supplies of distillates, including heating oil
and diesel, were unchanged, according to the survey’s median
estimate.  On a four-week average, demand in the week ended May 13 was
2.3 percent below a year earlier, compared with a 1.9 percent
deficit in the last week of April, according to department data.  This weekend’s three-day Memorial Day holiday period is the
traditional kickoff of the summer driving season.  Regular retail gasoline dropped 1.4 cents to $3.814 a
gallon, AAA said on its website.  Heating oil for June delivery added 1.37 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.9234 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
