The European Union agreed on
parameters for stress tests on nuclear power plants that the
bloc wants to conduct to reassess safety risks after a crisis in
 Japan , where an earthquake and tsunami crippled atomic reactors.  The tests on the regionâ€™s 143 atomic plants will cover
threats from natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornados,
extreme heat or snow, as well as airplane crashes and explosions
close to nuclear stations, the European Commission said today in
a statement. Preventive measures from terrorist attacks will be
excluded, according to the EU regulatory arm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
