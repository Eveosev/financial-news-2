The Treasury’s $35 billion sale of
five-year notes may draw a yield of 1.830 percent, according to
the average forecast of eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20
primary dealers surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The securities, which mature in May 2016, yielded 1.825
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  Today’s offering is the same size as the past eight monthly
five-year debt auctions. The last sale of the maturity, on April
27, drew a yield of 2.124 percent, down from 2.26 percent the
month before.  The April sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.77, down
from 2.79 at the March offering. The average for the past 10
sales is 2.82.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40 percent at the April sale and an
average of 41.6 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealers that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, purchased 11.2 percent of the
securities at each of the past two sales. That compared with an
average of 10.2 percent at the past 10 offerings.  Five-year notes have returned 2.6 percent this year, after
gaining 6.8 percent in 2010, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. Treasuries overall have advanced 2.1
percent this year and rose 5.9 percent last year.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in U.S. debt
auctions.  The Treasury auctioned $35 billion of two-year notes
yesterday and will sell $29 billion of seven-year debt tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
