U.S. nuclear-power production rose to
its highest level in more than seven weeks after  Entergy Corp. (ETR) 
started the Indian Point 2 reactor in  New York , the  Nuclear
Regulatory Commission  said.  Power generation nationwide increased by 1,565 megawatts,
or 2 percent, from yesterday to 79,482 megawatts, or 78 percent
of capacity, the most since April 2, according to an NRC report
today and data compiled by Bloomberg. Nineteen of the nationâ€™s
104 reactors were offline.  Entergy is operating the 1,020-megawatt Indian Point 2
reactor at 1 percent of capacity after shutting it on May 20 to
replace three high-voltage bushings on a main electrical
transformer.  The 1,025-megawatt Unit 3, the other operating reactor at
the site, is running at full capacity. The plant is located on
the  Hudson River  about 27 miles (43 kilometers) north of  New
York City .  The Tennessee Valley Authority boosted the 1,123-megawatt
Watts Bar 1 reactor in Tennessee to 80 percent of capacity from
53 percent yesterday. The unit, 55 miles southwest of Knoxville,
was shut for refueling April 4.  Comanche Peak Boost  Energy Future Holdings Corp. increased output from the
1,150-megawatt Comanche Peak Unit 2 to 97 percent of capacity
from 45 percent yesterday. The Texas unit was shut May 20 after
a main condenser tube failed because of a rising sodium
concentration, the NRC said.  The 1,200-megawatt Comanche Peak Unit 1 is producing at
full power. The plant is 66 miles southwest of  Dallas .  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  boosted the 1,295-megawatt Seabrook
reactor in New Hampshire to 69 percent of capacity from 38
percent yesterday. The plant, 13 miles south of Portsmouth, was
shut for refueling April 1.  The TVA increased output from the 1,104-megawatt Browns
Ferry 2 to 21 percent of capacity from 9 percent yesterday as
the plant powered up after storms on April 27 knocked out parts
of the regional transmission grid.  The 1,065-megawatt Browns Ferry 1 is also operating at 21
percent of capacity and the 1,115-megawatt Browns Ferry 3 is
expected to resume service after further repairs to transmission
lines.  There was no damage to the plant, located 84 miles (135
kilometers) north of Birmingham on Wheeler Lake, near the
 Tennessee  line.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
