Kenya ’s shilling weakened against the
dollar as the  central bank  purchased foreign currency to build
its reserves.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.5 percent to 86.71 per dollar and was trading 0.2
percent weaker at 86.45 by 3:08 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi,
from a close of 86.25 yesterday.  The Central Bank of Kenya bought 4 million euros ($6
million) at 121.77 shillings each today, taking its purchases of
foreign currency to 32 million euros since May 10. The bank is
buying euros to build up reserves and meet external payments, it
said May 20.  “The continuous buying of foreign exchange by central bank
to build up its reserves is putting the local unit under
pressure, a situation that is likely to persist as the build-up
is an ongoing activity,” Cynthia Mathenge, a dealer at Nairobi-
based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone.  The IMF’s executive board in January approved a $508.7
million three-year credit facility for Kenya, targeting an
increase of the country’s currency reserves to more than four
months of import cover. Initially, $101.7 million was released
and the second installment of $70 million could be disbursed by
July 15, if the board approves it, Domenico Fanizza, the IMF
mission chief for Kenya, told reporters in Nairobi yesterday.  The IMF cut its growth forecast for Kenya to between 5
percent and 5.4 percent this year, from 5.7 percent, citing the
impact on agriculture from poor rainfall, and recommended the
East African nation keeps tightening liquidity to curtail high
inflation.  The central bank sold 1.99 billion shillings ($23 million)
of  repurchase agreements  today, the 11th trading session this
month in which it sought to remove supply of the local currency.  Inflation accelerated for the six straight month in April
to 12.05 percent in April, the highest in two years and above
the government’s 5 percent target, as food and fuel prices rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
