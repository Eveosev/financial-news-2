JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, expects to conclude an $800 million asset-backed loan
next week as part of a plan to restructure debt and lower
borrowing costs, said a person familiar with the transaction.  The company is seeking to pay interest of about 4.5 percent
a year on the five-year syndicated loan and may borrow more
depending on demand for its debt, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the terms are confidential. The loan
from U.S. agricultural banks will be guaranteed by inventories
and other assets, according to the person.  JBS approved a plan to raise as much as $2.5 billion
through bonds and loans to pay off real-denominated obligations
in  Brazil , Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista said May 18.
The company this month sold $650 million of 10-year bonds to
yield 7.5 percent and received a seven-year term loan of $475
million with interest of 300 basis points, or 3 percentage
points, above the London interbank offered rate, known as Libor.  JBS rose 8 centavos, or 1.6 percent, to 5.16 reais at 4:33
p.m. in  Sao Paulo  trading. The stock has declined 24 percent in
the past year, compared with a 7.4 percent gain for Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
