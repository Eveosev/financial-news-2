OCI Co., South Korea’s largest maker
of polysilicon, tumbled in Seoul trading on speculation spot
prices of the material used to make solar cells will decline,
said JD Song, an analyst with Samsung Securities Co.   The stock sank 9.3 percent to 450,000 won as of 11:13 a.m.
on the Korea Exchange when the benchmark Kospi Index lost 1
percent.   “While investors’ concern about the price outlook is
driving the stock lower, most of the company’s sales are made
through long-term contracts and I believe the decline in share-
price is excessive,” Samsung’s Kim said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
