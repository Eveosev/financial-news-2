Cattle gained for the first time in
nine sessions on speculation that U.S. meat processors will buy
more animals after prices dropped yesterday to a five-month low.
Hogs rose.  Wholesale-beef prices climbed 2.1 percent in the past two
days, the biggest such gain since mid-March. Before today, the
meat had dropped 5.7 percent since April 1. Rising prices may
signal improved demand before the Memorial Day holiday in the
U.S., celebrated on May 31.  “Wholesale prices have dropped down low enough to where
the retailer is looking for supplies,” said Lawrence Kane, a
market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group in  Yates City ,
 Illinois . “At these prices, demand has probably picked up.”  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 1.325 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $1.05225 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. Yesterday, the price touched $1.03475, the
lowest since Dec. 17.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 1.75
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $1.24525 a pound.  Hog futures for July settlement rose 0.475 cent, or 0.5
percent, to 87.4 cents a pound in Chicago. In the previous two
days, prices fell 5.9 percent, the biggest such drop since
August. The commodity yesterday touched 86.6 cents, the lowest
since Jan. 25.  In the past four days, wholesale pork dropped 5.3 percent,
the biggest such slide since October. The declines may boost
demand for the meat, Kane said.  “As much as anything, we’re getting a good rebound after
the damage that was done,” Kane said. “Technically, we’re
oversold and product is moving, but moving slowly, at these
prices. Overall, the meat complex has been battered pretty
heavily.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
