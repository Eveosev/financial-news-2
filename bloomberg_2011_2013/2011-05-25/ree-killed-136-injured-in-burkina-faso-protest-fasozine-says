Three people died and at least 136
were injured during protests by students and troops in  Burkina
Faso ’s capital, Ouagadougou, yesterday, the head of the local
hospital said, according to the online newspaper  Fasozine .  Only three of the injured remain in the Yalgado Ouedraogo
hospital, Fasozine cited the hospital’s director-general,
Lassande Bangagne, as saying.  Burkina Faso,  Africa ’s biggest cotton producer, has been in
turmoil since February, when five people were killed during
demonstrations against the police following the death of a
student in their custody. Soldiers in the West African nation
mutinied last month, forcing President Blaise Compaore, who has
ruled the country since seizing power in a coup in 1987, to
dissolve the government and fire the head of his presidential
guard and the chiefs of the army, air force and police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
