shares control of the world’s biggest sugar-cane processor,
posted the biggest two-day advance in over a year as sugar
prices jumped.  Shares climbed 4.2 percent to 23.80 reais today at the

positive impact on the company’s shares,” said Leonardo Alves,
an equity analyst at Link Investimentos brokerage in Sao Paulo.  Raw sugar for July delivery gained 3.3 percent to settle at
