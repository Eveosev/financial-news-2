Pitcher Jo-Jo Reyes tied a
Major League Baseball record with his 28th straight start
without a victory as the  Toronto Blue Jays  lost to the  New York 
Yankees 7-3 in the finale of a three-game series.  Andruw Jones and Mark Teixeira hit home runs off Reyes as
the Yankees opened a 5-0 lead after three innings at Yankee
Stadium in New York. Jones also added a two-run homer in the
sixth inning and finished 3-for-3 with four runs batted in.  Reyes, 26, is now 0-13 since his last major-league win on
June 13, 2008, when he was pitching for the Atlanta Braves.
Reyes is the second pitcher since 1920 to go 28 consecutive
starts without a win, joining the Oakland Athleticsâ€™ Matt Keough
(1978-79).  Freddy Garcia picked up the win for New York, allowing
three runs over 6 1/3 innings. It was the fourth win in five
games for the Yankees (27-21), keeping them a half-game ahead of
the Boston  Red Sox  in the American League Eastern Division.  The Red Sox scored seven first-inning runs in a 14-2 rout
of the  Cleveland Indians  today. Carl Crawford went 4-for-4 with
a home run and Jon Lester recorded his AL-leading seventh win of
the season for the Red Sox (27-22).  To contact the reporter on this story:
