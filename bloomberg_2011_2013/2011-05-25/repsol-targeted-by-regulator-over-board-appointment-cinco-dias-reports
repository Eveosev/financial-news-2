Repsol YPF SA (REP) ’s appointment of a
banker to its board who’s affiliated with a competitor may be
investigated by  Spain ’s National Energy Commission, Cinco Dias
reported, citing a recommendation by a member of that regulator.  Luis Albentosa, a director of the energy commission, has
asked it to investigate the possible conflict of interest in
Mario Fernandez joining the board of directors of Repsol,
Spain’s largest oil company.  Fernandez is chairman of Spanish savings bank Bilbao
Bizkaia Kutxa, the second-biggest shareholder in  Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,
and his bank also holds a board seat at Iberdrola, the report
said. The April 15 appointment of Fernandez as an independent
Repsol director upset Iberdrola management “profoundly,”
according to Cinco Dias, because Iberdrola competes in the
natural gas-supply market with  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) , which is
controlled by Repsol and La Caixa bank.  Legal staff at the regulator now must produce a finding of
whether there is a conflict for Fernandez under article 34 of
the royal decree 6/2000 that governs competition among the
biggest energy companies.  A Repsol spokesman declined to comment today.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
