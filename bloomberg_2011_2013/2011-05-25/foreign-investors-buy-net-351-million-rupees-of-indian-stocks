Overseas investors bought a net 351
million rupees ($7.77 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
paring their outflows from equities this year to 30.8 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 25.4 billion rupees of shares and sold
25 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They sold 21.7 billion rupees of bonds, reducing
their debt purchases this year to 156.6 billion rupees.  Foreign funds bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. The Sensex has
fallen about 13 percent this year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.44 trillion rupees in equities and 943.3 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
