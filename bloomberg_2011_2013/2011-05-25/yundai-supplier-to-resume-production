Yoosung Enterprise Co.  said it will
resume supplying auto parts to  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors
Corp. (000270) ,  South Korea ’s biggest automakers, after police broke up a
strike at the company.  Production at Yoosung’s factory in Asan, southwest of Seoul,
will resume “soon,” Kim Jae Ki, a manager at company, said by
phone today without giving an exact time or date. Shares of
Hyundai, Kia and Yoosung rose on the Korea Exchange.  Police last night removed strikers occupying the factory,
said Lee Jung Hun, a spokesman for the labor union. The strikers,
who are seeking better pay and working hours, won’t try to
reenter the plant and are considering what to do next, he said.  Hyundai may be able to normalize operations at its Ulsan
plant as early as tomorrow, Yonhap News reported. Officials from
the two automakers weren’t immediately available to comment.  Kia rose 2.3 percent to 72,000 won at 9:57 a.m. in  Seoul ,
Hyundai gained 2 percent to 235,000 won and Yoosung jumped 9.4
percent to 3,790 won.  Hyundai and Kia said yesterday that production cuts forced
by the strike could have led to 827 billion won ($756 million)
in lost sales if the labor action continued through the end of
this month. Yoosung, which supplies piston rings, cylinder
liners and camshafts to the automakers, halted work on May 18.  Hyundai suspended production of diesel-powered Santa Fe and
Tucson sport-utility vehicles May 22, and Kia’s output of
Carnival minivans was halted May 20 because of parts shortages,
according to an e-mailed statement from the automakers yesterday.  The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association yesterday
called on the Yoosung workers to end the strike and said they
were “illegally” occupying the factory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
