Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said “dark forces” are waging a “war of attrition”
against efforts to strengthen regulation of the financial
system.  “You’re seeing some people run a war of attrition against
the reform act,” Geithner said at an event today in  Washington ,
without identifying the people. “They’re trying to starve the
agencies of funding so they can’t enforce protections for
investors.”  Geithner also said opponents of the Obama administration
are trying to block presidential appointments to regulatory
agencies “as a way to get leverage over the outcome, and
they’re trying to slow down so that they can weaken over time
the thrust” of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. “We’re
not going to let that happen.”  Republican lawmakers are opposing the nomination of  Peter Diamond  to the Federal Reserve Board. The White House
renominated Diamond in January, marking a third try at
confirmation after the Senate adjourned in December without
approving him. Diamond’s initial candidacy was returned to the
White House in August under a procedural objection.  Asked by a moderator at the breakfast held by Politico to
identify the “mysterious forces” working against the
administration, Geithner said, “dark forces, I would say.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
