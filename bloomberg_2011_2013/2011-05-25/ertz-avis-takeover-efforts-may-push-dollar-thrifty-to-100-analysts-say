Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ)  and  Avis
Budget Group Inc. (CAR)  may push  Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group
Inc. (DTG) ’s share price as high as $100 as they bid to be the second-
largest U.S. rental-car company, analysts said.  Dollar Thrifty, which rose 99 cents to $81.20 at 4:01 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading, is 13 percent
higher than the $72-a-share value of Hertz’s most recent offer
when it was made May 9. Avis bid $53 a share in September and
has been seeking U.S. Federal Trade Commission approval.  Dollar Thrifty, the third-largest publicly traded rental-
car chain, more than doubled in New York trading since April 25,
2010, the day before Hertz announced its first offer. Hertz has
boosted the cash and stock portions of its bid and has said the
acquisition will add to earnings in the year it’s completed.  “The numbers still make sense past $100,” Fred Lowrance,
an analyst with Avondale Partners LLC in Nashville,  Tennessee ,
said in an interview. “Some of the larger shareholders in Hertz
and Avis probably wouldn’t push back too hard if the price gets
toward $90. If it’s past $90 toward $100, shareholders may start
pushing back.”  Hertz’s offer would be worth $71.04 a share based on
today’s closing share prices, while Avis’s would be valued at
$56.77. Hertz’s offer would be worth a total of $2.06 billion,
topping Avis’s $1.64 billion bid. Those figures exclude options
and equity awards.  Bill Kavaler, senior special situations analyst at Oscar
Gruss & Son Inc. in New York, said the price could go to $100
and still add to earnings for Hertz. Kavaler said he doesn’t
expect the bidding to go that high because Avis will drop its
pursuit.  Hertz and Avis investors may object to bids that high, said
Stephen O’Hara, an analyst with Sidoti & Co. He expects the
Dollar Thrifty offers to stop at around $90.  ‘Reasonable’ Bids  “I think $100 is reasonable, running the numbers,” he
said in an interview. “I think it would be tough to get the
boards in tune with that kind of thinking. But what this really
depends on is Avis. If Avis doesn’t come back with an offer,
then Hertz is the only bid out there.”  Savings from a merger would more than cover the cost of
financing the takeover, even at $100 a share, Lowrance said.
Avis would increase earnings per share by 14 cents in the first
year at that price, while Hertz would add 13 cents, he said.  Stephanie Pillersdorf , a spokeswoman for Tulsa, Oklahoma-
based Dollar Thrifty, and  Andrew Siegel , a spokesman for
Parsippany, New Jersey-based Avis, declined to comment. Richard Broome, a Hertz spokesman, didn’t return an e-mail seeking
comment.  Dollar Thrifty had fallen from $53 on March 22, 2007, to 62
cents on March 3, 2009. Hertz offered on May 9 to buy the
rental-car operator for $57.60 in cash and 0.8546 Hertz shares
for each Dollar Thrifty share owned. Avis, on Sept. 23, bid
$45.79 in cash and 0.6543 shares of Avis stock.  ‘Unique Position’  “It’s a stunning run but the underlying earnings levels
are there,” Lowrance said. “Dollar Thrifty is in a unique
position where they are small enough to probably get through
antitrust but big enough that it actually makes a material
impact on the acquirer’s earnings.”  The nation’s four biggest chains generate 83 percent of
U.S. car-rental sales, according to IBISWorld, a  Santa Monica ,
California-based researcher. Closely held Enterprise had a 40
percent share, followed by Hertz with 20 percent and Avis with
17 percent. Dollar Thrifty accounted for 5.6 percent of the
industry’s sales, according to IBISWorld.  Hertz said yesterday it began an exchange offer for Dollar
Thrifty. Dollar Thrifty adopted a provision on May 18 that gives
its shareholders the right to purchase a new series of preferred
stock to thwart an unwanted takeover.  Hertz fell 4 cents to $15.73. Avis rose 5 cents to $16.78.  Six Attempts  Hertz’s latest offer is at least the sixth attempt by Hertz
or Avis to buy Dollar Thrifty in the past 13 months, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. In April 2010, Hertz agreed to
buy Dollar Thrifty for $41 a share in cash and stock.  Hertz, which operates its namesake premium brand and the
Advantage budget brand it acquired in 2009, wants to boost its
presence in the mid-tier market, an area in which it is “really
uncompetitive,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Frissora said on a
conference call with analysts and investors. Hertz has said it
expects to sell Advantage to address FTC concerns that it would
hold too much of the market.  The U.S. car rental and leasing industry shrunk an average
of 2.5 percent a year from 2006 to 2011 as the recession slowed
corporate and leisure travel, according to a report this month
from IBISWorld. The market is projected to grow 2 percent per
year between now and 2016, according to IBISWorld.  To contact the reporter on this story:
