Swiss stocks erased their declines,
as the shares of UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG gained,
offsetting concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will hurt the
global economic recovery.  OC Oerlikon Corp. and Meyer Burger Technology AG, both
manufacturers of solar-power equipment, each declined more than
2 percent.  The Swiss Market Index of the biggest and most actively
traded companies advanced 0.1 percent to 6,463.22 at 10:38 a.m.
in Zurich. The gauge has still advanced 7.3 percent since its
March 16 low as 7 out of 10 companies’ posted earnings that beat
estimates. The broader Swiss Performance Index gained less than
0.1 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
