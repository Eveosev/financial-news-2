The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment fell in  Japan , according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell half a basis point to
123 basis points as of 9:20 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose half a basis point
to 110 basis points as of 10:18 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50
investment-grade borrowers outside Japan also advanced 0.5 basis
point to 109.5 as of 8:20 a.m. in Singapore, according to BNP
Paribas SA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
investors in bonds against default, and traders use them to
speculate on credit quality. A drop signals improving
perceptions of creditworthiness.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
