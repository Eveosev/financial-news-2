Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-biggest oil
company, sees “structural support” for energy prices as global
oil demand rises to 95 million barrels a day in 2020 and spare
capacity drops.  “This increase in demand combined with a decline of the
fields already in production means that there is a need to
develop about 40 million barrels a day of new production
capacity between now and 2020,” Yves-Louis Darricarrere,
Total’s head of exploration and production, said at an energy
conference in Paris today. Global spare production capacity will
fall to 3 percent in 2015 from 6 percent at present.  Total plans to replace reserves through internal growth and
“selective” acquisitions, according to Darricarrere. The
French  oil company  has pledged to make its search for new oil
and gas deposits “bolder” and will focus on deep offshore and
liquefied natural gas projects as well as producing heavy oils
and complex and unconventional natural gas.  Total forecasts a “progressive reduction” of the gas
“bubble” outside  North America  and growing dependence on LNG
in Europe and Asia, he said.  The French company, which has disappointed investors in the
past by missing output targets, is sticking to a production goal
of an average of 2 percent growth annually through 2015,
Darricarrere said. Four projects will begin this year and six
from 2012.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
