(Corrects share price in second paragraph.)  El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL)  Ltd. tumbled
the most in more than two months after the national carrier said
its first-quarter loss more than doubled.  The shares declined 4.7 percent, the most since March 21,
to 1.052 shekels at 11:16 a.m. in  Tel Aviv . That gave the
company a market value of 521.5 million shekels ($149 million).  The loss widened to $42.9 million from $16.5 million a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
