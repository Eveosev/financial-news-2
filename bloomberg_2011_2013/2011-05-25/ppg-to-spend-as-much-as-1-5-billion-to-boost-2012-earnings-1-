PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) , the world’s
second-biggest paint maker, plans to boost 2012 earnings per
share by spending as much as $1.5 billion this year on
acquisitions, debt repayment and share repurchases.  Spending $750 million to $1.5 billion of cash in the
remainder of 2011 will boost earnings next year by 15 cents to
55 cents a share, Chief Executive Officer Charles Bunch said
today in a statement.  Buybacks have reduced PPG’s share count by more than 40
percent since 1984, Bunch said today in a webcast. The
Pittsburgh-based company repurchased $600 million of stock in
2010 and the pace is accelerating because PPG has “excess
cash,” he said. Debt repayment, with potential acquisitions of
coatings companies costing $25 million to $250 million each,
will account for the rest of cash deployment this year.  “This will provide an earnings lift to us this year and
next,” Bunch said today in a webcast from the Goldman Sachs
Basic Materials Conference in  New York .  PPG rose $1.40, or 1.6 percent, to $87.33 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 3.9 percent this year.  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA)  is the world’s largest paint maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
