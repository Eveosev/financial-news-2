(Corrects attribution in second paragraph.)  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chairman Clemens Boersig is looking for a management board member from a DAX
company to lead the lender together with Anshu Jain after Chief
Executive Officer Josef Ackermann steps down,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing people familiar with the situation.  The new co-CEO would not be a banker, the newspaper said.
Former Bundesbank chief Axel Weber’s chances for the job are
declining, FTD said, citing people in the banking industry.  Reto Francioni, chief executive officer of  Deutsche Boerse
AG (DB1)  and Paul Achleitner, chief financial officer of Allianz SE,
were named in the prelude to a supervisory board meeting, but
both were “test balloons,” the newspaper reported. Achleitner
said the job would be out of the question for him, the FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
