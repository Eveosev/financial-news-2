A bubbly secretary enters the waiting
room of a repressed dentist and turns his world upside down.  Cleo (Jessica Raine) is the personable assistant in
“ Rocket to the Moon ,” a 1938 Clifford Odets play that returns
to  London ’s National Theatre this weekend. She hopes to take a
plane, a boat or a rocket to wherever, preferably in the company
of her married boss (Joseph Millson).  Though the play runs on, the cast is well steered, and sets
-- including a tiled 1930s corridor -- are handsome.  “Rocket to the Moon” is back for a second run at the
Lyttelton Theatre, SE1 9PX, through June 21. Information:
 http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk , +44-207-452-3000.  Saturday  “Avatar” meets the Chelsea Flower Show.  James Cameron ’s 3-D blockbuster is the inspiration for the
 Irish Sky Garden  -- a pink, plant-filled pod suspended from a
crane -- which won a gold medal at London’s century-old
horticultural extravaganza.  While you’re there, check out another gold medalist: the
first-ever pavilion from the Principality of  Monaco , which has
(what else?) an inviting swimming pool.  The Chelsea Flower Show ends Saturday at the Royal Chelsea
Hospital. Information:  http://tinyurl.com/646txb2 .  Ziani is a popular Venetian restaurant nearby. Information:

flamboyant celebration of the show, Sketch in Mayfair has a
special menu featuring hibiscus syrup and poppy vinegar:

having recovered from the laryngitis that forced the
postponement of this week’s shows in the U.K. The band’s world
tour now comes to London’s  O2  Saturday. The now-bearded Le Bon
will belt out hits such as “Girls on Film” and “Hungry Like the
Wolf.”  The group is promoting the album “All You Need Is Now,” a
return to its electropop roots after more than three decades in
the business.  O2, Peninsula Sq., SE10 0DX. Information: +44-20-8463-2000,

bed, now has her whole life on show at the Hayward Gallery.
There are pill jars, used band-aids, miserable letters, and a
wall of appliqued blankets crudely mapping episodes in her
personal life.  Though the exhibition is not for prudes, Emin can draw, and
her best work has pizzazz.  Information: +44-844-875-0073 or
 http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/venues/hayward-gallery   Skylon Grill is convenient for an informal meal near the
Hayward. The views are superb, and chef Helena Puolakka,
classically trained with culinary masters such as  Alain Ducasse 
and Pierre Koffmann, shows that straightforward dishes such as
wild mushroom linguine and burgers are well within her range.
