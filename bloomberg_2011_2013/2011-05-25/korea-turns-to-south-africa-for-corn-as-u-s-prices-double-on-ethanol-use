South Korea , the biggest corn
importer in  Asia  after  Japan , is buying more from South Africa
after U.S. prices doubled in the past year.  The country imported 401,070 metric tons of South African
corn for livestock feed in the first four months, data on  the
website  of the Korea International Trade Association show. That
compares with the 208,866 tons shipped in all of 2010.  Corn in  Chicago  climbed in April to the highest level since
the global food crisis in 2008 as demand for feed and ethanol
outpaced production. That helped push world food costs to a
record in February, the United Nations estimates, spurring
conflict and riots in North Africa and Middle East and driving
44 million people into poverty. Rabobank International says U.S.
predictions for the corn harvest this year are optimistic
because of poor weather and planting conditions.  “Importers purchased South African corn because it was
more competitive than U.S. grain in terms of price,” said Lee
Young Il, a general manager at Nonghyup Feed Inc., the biggest
feed-grain buyer. The U.S. is the world’s biggest producer and
exporter.  Corn from  South Africa  was about $5 to $10 per ton cheaper
than the U.S. variety earlier this year, Lee said, with the gap
narrowing to about $3 a ton now.  Nonghyup bought two cargoes this year, Lee said. The Korea
Feed Association, the largest grain-buying group, purchased 13
cargoes, or about 650,000 tons, since last year, according to
data from  the group .  Exports Quadruple  Yellow-corn exports from South Africa almost quadrupled to
a 14-year high of 1.02 million tons in the year ended April 30
from 261,608 tons in the year-ago, data on the South African
Grain Information Service’s website showed on May 4.  “We’d like to increase corn purchases from South Africa as
long as price gaps remain around the $5 to $10 level as feed
makers try to buy cheaper alternatives to expensive U.S. corn,”
said Kim Chi Young, director for Korea Feed’s grain purchases.  The nation imported 6.53 million tons of feed-corn last
year, of which about 92 percent was sourced from the U.S.,
according to data from the trade association. There were no
purchases from South Africa in 2009, the data show.  Corn production in South Africa may climb to 12.3 million
tons in the year that began May 1 from 11.4 million tons a year
earlier, the  Foreign Agricultural Service  of the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said in a report on May 11. Exports will be
unchanged at 2 million tons, it said.  Corn advanced 0.6 percent to $7.3775 a bushel at 11:21 a.m.
