Bulgaria’s Cabinet approved a bill
banning diplomats who served as secret police agents before the
collapse of communism from holding ambassadorships or other
senior foreign ministry jobs.  The bill, which has yet to be voted on in Parliament, will
enable the Cabinet to recall the former spies, the Sofia-based
government said in a statement today. President Georgi Parvanov,
who is in charge of appointing ambassadors, rejected a Cabinet
request to recall those identified as former agents.  A commission, set up in March 2007 to open the archives of
the former State Security Committee, on Dec. 14 identified 218
ambassadors, deputy mission chiefs and consuls on its  website 
who collaborated with the communist regime’s secret services
between 1945 and 1989.  Foreign Minister Nikolai Mladenov this month ordered 13
ambassadors who were former spies, and were appointed to
European Union capitals and international organizations
including the  United Nations , to return to Sofia until the new
law is enacted and their assignments can be terminated.  Bulgaria in 2006 required the names of public figures who
worked for the communist secret services to be published. The
panel has since screened and found former communist-era spies
among lawmakers, including Parvanov, and journalists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
