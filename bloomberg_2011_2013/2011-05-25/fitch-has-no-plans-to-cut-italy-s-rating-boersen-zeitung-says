Fitch Ratings Ltd. has no plans to
lower  Italy ’s credit rating or the outlook for the country,
which is stable,  David Riley , group managing director of
sovereign ratings at the company, told  Boersen-Zeitung .  Fitch doesn’t expect Italy to pose a significant risk for
the rest of the euro region as long as Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s government adheres to its 2011 deficit-reduction
plans, which have been on target so far, the German newspaper
quoted Riley as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
