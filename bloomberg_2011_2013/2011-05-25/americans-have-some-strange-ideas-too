After International Monetary Fund
chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was arrested and charged with
sexually attacking a housekeeper in a New York City hotel room,
a poll found that 57 percent of his French compatriots thought
he was the "victim of a plot." It was tempting to think the
survey, conducted for the newspaper 20 Minutes and BFM TV,
reflected Gaullist paranoia or thickheadedness.  In all humility, however, it’s worth remembering that a
sizable chunk of the American public has, at times, believed
things at least as far-fetched. To wit:  -- 25 percent of Americans believed, earlier this year,
that  Barack Obama  was "born in another country," according to a
CBS News/New York Times survey.  -- 20 percent posited, in a 2007 poll by Princeton Survey
Research Associates International, that most of the Sept. 11
hijackers came from  Iraq . (None did; 15 of the 19 were Saudi
Arabian.)  -- 36 percent thought, in 2006, that U.S. federal officials
either participated in the Sept. 11 attacks or took no action to
stop them, according to a Scripps Survey Research Center survey.  -- 32 percent suspected, in an ABC News poll conducted nine
months into  O.J. Simpson ’s 2005 trial, that Los Angeles police
had framed Simpson for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown
Simpson.  -- 6 percent said the U.S. government had faked the Apollo
11 moon landing, according to a 1999 Gallup poll.  -- 39 percent said, in a 1997 Fox News/Opinion Dynamics
poll, that the U.S. Air Force was covering up a 1947 crash by a
UFO in Roswell,  New Mexico .  (Robert A. Di Ieso, Jr. is a graphic designer. The Opinions
