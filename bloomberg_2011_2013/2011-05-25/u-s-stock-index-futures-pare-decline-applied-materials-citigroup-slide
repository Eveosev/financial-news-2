U.S. stock futures pared their losses
as concern eased that some European countries will fail to repay
all of their debt.  Applied Materials Inc., the world’s largest producer of
chip-making equipment, forecast earnings that missed estimates,
dropping 2.9 percent in German trading. Citigroup Inc. slipped
as a report said that the five biggest U.S. banks may face at
least $17 billion in civil lawsuits.  June contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1
percent to 1,311.9 at 11:03 a.m. in  London  after the gauge
yesterday fell to its lowest level since April 19. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures retreated 34 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 12,314 today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
