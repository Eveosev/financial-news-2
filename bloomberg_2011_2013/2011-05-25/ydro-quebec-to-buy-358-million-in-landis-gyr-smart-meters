Hydro-Quebec, the Canadian province’s
state-owned utility, will buy 3 million smart meters made by
Swiss energy efficiency company Landis+Gyr AG in a contract
valued at C$350 million ($358 million).  The purchase, installation and operation of the meters will
save C$300 million during the next 20 years after an initial
investment of $100 million to set up the system, Montreal-based
Hydro-Quebec said today in a statement.  The smart meters installed with power customers will allows
Hydro-Quebec to remotely gather data on demand, detect outages
and manage consumption. Landis+Gyr will provide 80 percent of
the 3.75 million meters Hydro-Quebec plans to install, the Zug,
Switzerland-based company said today in a  statement .  Toshiba Corp. (6502) ,  Japan ’s biggest maker of nuclear reactors,
agreed on May 19 to acquire Landis+Gyr for $2.3 billion in cash
and assumed debt.  Between 2012 to 2017, the remote meter reading will lead to
the elimination of 725 positions, which will be reassigned to
other roles, Hydro-Quebec said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
