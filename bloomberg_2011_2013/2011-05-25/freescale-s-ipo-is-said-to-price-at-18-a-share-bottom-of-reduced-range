Freescale Semiconductor Holdings
priced its initial public offering at $18 a share, the bottom of
a reduced range, according to two people with knowledge of the
sale.  The Austin, Texas-based company is selling 43.5 million
shares in the IPO, according to a regulatory filing. Freescale
lowered the range earlier today to $18 to $20 from $22 to $24.
At the offering price, the shares reflect a 50 percent discount
to the average of $36 that investors paid for the company.  Freescale filed its intention to sell shares to the public
in February, saying it would use the proceeds to help reduce its
debt, which is about $7.5 billion. Freescale, the largest
supplier of chips to the U.S. automobile industry, borrowed
billions as it was taken private by Blackstone Group LP, TPG
Capital,  Carlyle Group  and Permira Advisers LLP in a $17.6
billion transaction in 2006.  Freescale, which will be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker symbol FSL, has been one of the worst
performers among companies taken private during the buyout boom,
with a $1.05 billion net loss in 2010. Other private equity-
backed IPOs this year have benefited their investors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
