German electricity for next year was
little changed, rising from its lowest in six weeks as  oil
prices  rebounded.  Baseload power for 2012 gained 5 cents, or 0.1 percent, to
58.55 euros ($82.49) at 6:20 p.m. Berlin time, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier traded as low as
58.05 euros. Baseload power is delivered around the clock.  The region’s benchmark contract closed at 60.55 euros on
April 4, the highest since June 2009, as  Germany  shut reactors
for a safety review after the Japanese nuclear disaster.  Crude rebounded after a report showed that U.S. inventories
of distillate fuel, a category that includes diesel and heating
oil, tumbled to the lowest level in more than two years as
consumption increased. Brent for July settlement rose 1.5
percent to $114.24 a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Crude affects the cost of natural gas and coal, used
at power stations to generate electricity.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp was unchanged at $126.75 a metric ton, after earlier
trading as low as $125.50. The fuel accounted for about a fifth
of Germany’s power last year. Germany also produces electricity
from lignite, or brown coal, natural gas, wind and solar plants.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
