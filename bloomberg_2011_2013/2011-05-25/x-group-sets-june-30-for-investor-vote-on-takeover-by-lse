TMX Group Inc. (X)  and  London Stock
Exchange Group Plc (LSE) ’s owners will vote June 30 on whether to
approve their deal uniting markets in Toronto and the U.K.  Two-thirds of TMX shareholders need to approve LSE’s C$3.29
billion ($3.37 billion) all-stock offer for the takeover to
proceed. The transaction also requires approval from  Canada ’s
federal government and provincial regulators. A simple majority
of LSE shareholders need to approve the bid.  TMX, the owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange, rejected a
competing cash-and-stock bid valued at C$3.58 billion from banks
and pension funds, saying it wasn’t “superior.”  The TMX meeting will be held at the Design Exchange at 234
Bay Street in Toronto starting at 10 a.m., the Toronto-based
exchange owner said today in a statement. LSE said in a separate
statement it will hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting the
same day to approve the agreement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
