U.S. stocks drifted between gains and
losses as shares of commodity producers advanced, while Costco
Wholesale Corp. and Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. led consumer
companies lower after earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,315.65 as of 10:30 a.m. in  New York  after slipping as much as
0.3 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 3.63 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,359.84.  The  S&P 500  has fallen 3.5 percent from an almost three-
year high on April 29 amid a commodity slump, lower-than-
estimated economic data and concern that Europe’s debt crisis
may derail the global recovery. The benchmark gauge is still up
4.7 percent so far this year as the  Federal Reserve  extended its
stimulus measures and companies posted higher-than-estimated
earnings.  Treasuries climbed today, pushing yields to near their
lowest level this year, as investors speculated that Europe’s
debt crisis will worsen and the U.S. economy will weaken.  Notes advanced for a fifth day after Greek Prime Minister
 George Papandreou  said yesterday markets are afraid of his
nation’s debt and their concern has spread to other countries.  Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the group of euro-area
finance ministers, yesterday said he opposes a “full
restructuring” of Greece’s debt. Euro-area countries may
further help Greece with its debt crisis if the country complies
with the 17-member currency group’s requests, he told reporters
in The Hague. A final assessment on new measures for Greece may
come as early as next week, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
