European Central Bank Governing
Council member Jens Weidmann said that the central bank should
normalize  interest rates  and withdraw unconventional measures,
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported.  The ECB’s monetary policy is still “accommodative,”
Weidmann told the newspaper, according to the pre-release of an
interview in tomorrow’s edition. “We face two tasks -- the
normalization of non-standard measures and the normalization of
the interest rate.”  He said that a so-called soft restructuring of Greek debt
would lower incentives for the country to press ahead with
adjustment measures and may cause “euro-wide problems,”
according to the newspaper.The Bundesbank president also said
that the extension of maturities on sovereign bonds should be
possible in the future provided a country is receiving aid
loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
