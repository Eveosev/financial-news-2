Diageo Plc (DGE)  said Stuart Fletcher,
president of its international unit, and chief customer officer
Ron Anderson will leave after the maker of Johnnie Walker scotch
and Smirnoff vodka completes a review of its operating model.  The executives will probably leave the distiller in the
middle of next year when changes to the operating model are
completed, London-based Diageo said in a regulatory filing.  Diageo will change the configuration of its international
business and designate separate Latin America/Caribbean and
Africa business regions from July, the statement shows.  “The regional variation in the pace of economic growth has
created significant change and new opportunities for Diageo as a
global business,” Chief Executive Officer Paul Walsh said in
the statement. The company announced yesterday a workers’
consultation process on “significant” changes planned for
Diageo’s European business organization, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
