More than 2,000 Greek protesters
gathered outside the country’s Parliament House in central
 Athens  today, taking their lead from a Spanish protest against
the country’s lawmakers and government austerity measures.  The crowd reached about 2,500 people, according to an
Athens police spokesman. The protesters call themselves the
“The Exasperated of Syntagma,” said the police press officer,
who wouldn’t be named in line with policy.  The demonstration was organized through social-networking
websites with almost 27,000 people registered as ‘attending’ the
event on the website of  Facebook Inc. , following the example set
by Spanish demonstrators in  Madrid ’s Puerta Del Sol Square,
where they pitched tents on May 15.  They are calling for changes to the electoral system to
reduce the dominance of the two main parties. The protests,
which have spread to other Spanish cities and have been
supported by people of all ages, call for voters to be able to
choose lawmakers directly rather than for party lists. The
movement said on May 24 it will continue demonstrating “at
least” through May 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
