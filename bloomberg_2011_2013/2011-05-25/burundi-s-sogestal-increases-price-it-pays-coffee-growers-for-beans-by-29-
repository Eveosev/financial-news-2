Burundi increased the amount it pays
coffee growers for their beans by 29 percent after
international prices increased, Societe de Gestion des Station
de Lavage, or Sogestal, said.  The minimum price offered to farmers was increased to 630
Burundian francs (51 cents) per kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 490
francs previously, Sogestal, which is jointly owned by the
state and private operators, said in a statement yesterday in
the capital, Bujumbura.  Sogestal manages 138 coffee-washing stations that buy
beans from growers across Burundi, according to the website of
the  Coffee Board of Burundi .  Burundi grows mainly the arabica variety of coffee and the
beans generate more than half of the East African country’s
foreign-exchange earnings. Arabica coffee for July delivery
fell 0.95 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $2.6025 a pound by 08:55
a.m. in  London  on ICE Futures U.S. Prices of the beans have
almost doubled over the past 12 months.  Burundian coffee exports increased to 344,767 60-kilogram
bags between April 2010 and March 2011, from 172,937 bags in
the same period a year earlier, according to data on the
 website  of the  International Coffee Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
