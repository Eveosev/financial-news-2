The pound strengthened for a second
day against the dollar as a report showed U.K. exports helped
the economy resume growth in the first quarter, outweighing the
biggest slump in  consumer spending  in almost two years.  Britain’s currency appreciated against all but one of its
major peers, gaining most against  South Africa ’s rand. Gross
domestic product expanded 0.5 percent in the first three months
of this year, matching an initial estimate, data showed today.
Exports rose 3.7 percent in the quarter and net trade added a
record 1.7 percentage points to GDP growth. Consumer spending
dropped 0.6 percent, the most since the second quarter of 2009.  “The growth data was in line with consensus,” said  Chris Walker , a currency strategist at UBS AG in London. “There are
signs that the economy is moving towards more export-driven
growth and this is supportive for the pound.”  Sterling was 0.6 percent stronger at $1.6271 as of 4:19
p.m. in  London  after dropping to as low as $1.6132. The pound
appreciated 0.7 percent to 86.57 pence per euro, after reaching
86.33 pence, the strongest since March 15. It gained 0.6 percent
to 133.36 yen.  The British currency strengthened through its 100-day
moving average, at 86.47 pence, for the first time since Feb.
28, Bloomberg data show.  The U.K. government is implementing the toughest budget
squeeze since World War II in a bid to cut the bulk of the
nation’s deficit by April 2015. Gross domestic product is
forecast to expand 1.5 percent this year, after growing 1.6
percent last year, according to Bloomberg surveys of economists.  Risk Appetite  Two-year U.K. government note yields fell to the lowest in
more than six months as euro-region woes boosted demand for the
safest assets. They were two basis points lower at 0.93 percent,
after reaching 0.895 percent, the weakest since Nov. 10. Ten-
year gilt yields declined two basis points to 3.32 percent.  “The main driving force for gilts is risk appetite,” said
 Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Ltd.
in Edinburgh. “On a weekly forecast, gilts could rally further
if risk appetite worsens.”  Money markets price in a 25 basis-point increase in the key
rate in February, according to sterling overnight interbank
average forwards, Tullett Prebon Plc data show. As recently as
February investors bet the rate would be lifted this month.  Short-sterling futures were little changed, with the
implied yield on the contract expiring in December at 1.03
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
