Japan ’s bond futures fell the most in
seven weeks as equity gains and yields near a six-month low
damped demand for government debt.  Bonds dropped as Treasuries declined before data forecast
to show the pace of U.S. economic growth in the first quarter
was stronger than previously estimated. Twenty-year bonds rose
for a third day after today’s auction of the securities drew
stronger demand than some traders had expected.  “People will need new factors such as concerns about a
recession and deflation to be able to buy bonds further,” said
Keiko Onogi, a Tokyo-based fixed-income strategist at Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets Co.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery dropped 0.29 to
140.60 as of the afternoon close at the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange. It
was the biggest drop since April 6.  The yield on the 1.1 percent bond due March 2021 rose two
basis points to 1.14 percent at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The price fell 0.176
yen to 99.647 yen.  The yield touched 1.105 percent on May 16, the lowest since
Nov. 24. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY) 
Stock Average advanced 1.5 percent today, while Treasury 10-year
yields rose three basis points to 3.16 percent.  The  U.S. economy  expanded at a 2.2 percent rate, up from
the 1.8 percent initially estimated, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the
Commerce Department’s data today.  The lowest price at today’s 20-year auction was 99.75 yen,
higher than 99.55 yen median forecast from 14 traders in a
Bloomberg survey. The sale drew bids worth 3.89 times the amount
on offer, up from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 2.92 times
at the previous auction in April.  “The auction was strong, causing investors to cover their
short positions,” said   Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at
Tokai Tokyo Securities Co. “I expect 10-year yields to fall to
as low as 1.05 percent by the end of June.”  Twenty-year yields fell one basis point to 1.9 percent  To contact the reporter on this story:
