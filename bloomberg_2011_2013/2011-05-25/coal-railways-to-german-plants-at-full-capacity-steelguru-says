Rail lines carrying coal from
European ports to German ports are running at full capacity as
low river levels impede barge deliveries, SteelGuru said, citing
a report from Montel Media.  Coal buyers on the  spot market  are paying “quite a chunk”
for boat deliveries, the report said, citing an analyst it
didn’t name. Water levels on some sections of the Rhine River
are more than 50 percent below average and German coal importers
have to pay a barge premium that rises as waters drop, the
report said.  The situation is not so serious for most utilities because
they can use stockpiles, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
