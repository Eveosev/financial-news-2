Rural Electrification Corp., a state-
owned lender to Indian power projects, said it may increase
disbursals to as much as 300 billion rupees ($6.6 billion) in
the year that started April 1.  “After disbursing about 230 billion rupees last year, even
more projects sanctioned this year means a greater appetite for
funds,” Chairman Hari Das Khunteta said in an interview at his
office in New Delhi today.  Power producers are setting up plants in  India  as the
government targets the addition of 120 gigawatts of generation
capacity by 2017. The world’s second-fastest growing major
economy had a 10.7 percent peak power deficit in the year ended
March 31.  REC plans to raise $1.5 billion, or 23 percent of the funds
it needs this financial year, from overseas bonds and loans. The
remaining 232 billion rupees will come from rupee loans
domestically, Khunteta said.  The lender is in talks with state-owned Life Insurance
Corp. of India to borrow 15 billion rupees at 9.35 percent over
10 years, Khunteta said. The company is raising $750 million in
yen, Swiss franc and dollar bonds and will arrange an additional
$750 million after getting central bank approval.  The 16.1 billion yen bond will be raised at 190 basis
points over Libor, the London interbank offered rate, or about
8.5 percent after hedging the cost of converting the yen to
rupees, Khunteta said.  The lender aims to increase its share of the market for
power project loans to as much as 25 percent by March 2017 from
about 20 percent at present, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
