Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the largest U.S.
oil company, flared gases at the Joliet, Illinois, refinery,
according to a filing with state regulators.  “A compressor trip led to flaring of SO2,” Kevin Allexon,
an Exxon spokesman based in Fairfax,  Virginia , said in an e-mail
late yesterday. Allexon declined to comment on “operational
details like run rates nor will we speculate on when repairs
might be completed.” Exxon expects to meet customer commitments
while repairs are made, he said.  The refinery started flaring gases yesterday at 1:30 a.m.
local time, according to a  filing  with the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency.  The refinery reported an upset late May 21 and said more
than 500 pounds of sulfur dioxide was released, according to an
earlier  filing  with the agency. The plant started a unit and
flared gas May 23, according to another  filing  made available
yesterday.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed.  The Joliet refinery is 42 miles (68 kilometers) southwest
of  Chicago  on the Des Plaines River.  To contact the reporter on this story:
