Philip Falcone , whose Harbinger
Capital Partners LLC is the largest shareholder in Crosstex
Energy Inc., said the stock may double to $18 a share on rising
 oil prices .  “If you’re a believer in higher oil prices, this is an
excellent way to play that part of the business,” Falcone said
of the Dallas-based processor and distributor of natural gas. He
was speaking today at the Ira Sohn investment conference in New
York.  Shares of Crosstex climbed 7 percent to $9.76 at 2:20 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  Falcone expects that earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to climb to at least $230 million
this year from $182 million in 2010.  New York-based Harbinger, which managed $6 billion in
assets, owns about 9.8 percent of Crosstex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
