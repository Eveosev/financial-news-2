Ireland’s economy likely won’t expand
this year as private domestic demand contracts further under the
weight of austerity measures, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.  “Weighed down by fiscal consolidation, high indebtedness,
tax increases and falling wages, private domestic demand is
expected to continue contracting in 2011,” the OECD said in its
economy outlook report today.  A recovery in Ireland’s economy, which contracted by about
14.5 percent since the end of 2007, may “gather some speed” in
2012 as domestic demand improves and exports continue to grow,
the OECD said. Irish Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  is seeking to
return Ireland to growth, while cutting the  budget deficit  and
propping up the banking industry.  The Irish government last month cut its economic growth
forecast for this year to 0.75 percent from 1.75 percent. The
Irish Central Bank the same month said it expects the economy to
grow by 0.9 percent.  The Irish government may have to take additional measures
to reduce its budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic
product by 2015, the OECD said. Ireland agreed to cut its budget
deficit under its 85-billion euro ($119 billion) rescue package
with the European Union and  International Monetary Fund  in
November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
