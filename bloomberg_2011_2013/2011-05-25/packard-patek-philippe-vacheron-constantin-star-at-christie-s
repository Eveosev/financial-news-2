Time is money for watch collectors as
unique pieces from the collection of U.S. car manufacturer James
Ward Packard (1863-1928) head for the auction block at
Christie’s International next month.  Kept for 60 years in a bank vault, the four timepieces have
a presale estimate of $454,000 to $906,000. The group will star
in Christie’s Important Watches sale on June 15, expected to
tally as much as $8.5 million.  A founder of  Packard Motor Car Co.  in 1902, Packard was
“the godfather of watch collectors,” said Sam Hines, head of
watches for Christie’s Americas and  Asia . He “had watches
customized for him by the brands.”  A 20-karat-gold Vacheron Constantin has Packard’s signature
Art Nouveau monogram in blue enamel and a presale estimate of
$250,000 to $500,000. Made in 1919. it strikes every hour and
every quarter.  Handwritten operating instruction that accompany the watch
might have been written by Packard, Hines said.  The second highlight of the group is a previously
unrecorded 18-karat gold minute-repeater that Packard
commissioned from Patek Philippe in 1918. Its estimate is
$200,000 to $400,000. One of 17 watches the Swiss firm made
specifically for Packard, this minute-repeater has a power
reserve and an unusual Murat-style case.  The remaining pieces are two 19th-century pocket watches
that belonged to Packard’s father, Warren Packard, and were made
by American Watch Co.  The  Patek Philippe  comes with an original box, original
certificate, a spare crystal and two spare main springs, Hines
said. All four pieces are being sold by Packard’s descendants.  “The watches have all the attributes the market is looking
for today,” Hines said, listing the brand, complications,
condition, provenance and completeness.  “When the watch carries all of those, there’re a lot of
potential collectors who might want them,” he said.  To contact the reporter of this story:
