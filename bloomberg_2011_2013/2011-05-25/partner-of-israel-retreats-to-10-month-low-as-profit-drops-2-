Partner Communications Co.,  Israel ’s
second-largest mobile phone company, dropped to the lowest level
in more than 10 months after first-quarter profit tumbled 25
percent as regulators cut fees and competition increased.  The shares declined 4 percent to 59.99 shekels, the lowest
level since July 7, at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The
stock was lowered to “market perform” from “outperform” at
Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd.  Net income declined to 254 million shekels ($73 million)
from 337 million shekels a year earlier, according to a
statement with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange today. Cellular
services revenue fell 18 percent to 1.1 billion shekels.  The earnings “reflect the impact of the reduction in
interconnect tariffs and the implementation of the new consumer
regulation, which led to a further intensification of
competition in the cellular market,” Chief Executive Officer
Yacov Gelbard said in the e-mailed statement. “The level of
competition is expected to become even stronger in future
months.”  The government this year started to enforce a gradual 75
percent reduction in interconnection fees on mobile-phone calls,
the tariff charged customers when they call between networks.
The fee will be gradually reduced to 0.0555 shekel by 2014,
Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon said last September.  “The 21 percent decline in average revenue per user is
just the beginning,” Clal analyst Tsahi Avraham wrote in a note
to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
