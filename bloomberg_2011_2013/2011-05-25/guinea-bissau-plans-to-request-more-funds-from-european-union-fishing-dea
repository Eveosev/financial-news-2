Guinea-Bissau wants to renegotiate a
fishing agreement with the European Union that would earn the
West African nation more money from allowing European ships to
trawl its coast.  A 2007 accord offers licenses to as many as 37 vessels to
fish a 54,000 square-kilometer (20,850 square-mile) zone for 7
million euros ($9.9 million) a year, according to the contract
published on the EU’s website.  When it expires in June, Guinea-Bissau will ask the EU to
increase the annual royalty to “a fair amount” of about 11
million euros, Virginia Pires Correia, director-general of the
Fisheries Ministry, said in an interview on May 20.  “This country can’t advance without optimizing its fishing
sector,” she said. The cancellation of the country’s external
debt in December will enable the country to turn down an offer
that the government feels is unjust, Correia said.  The  International Monetary Fund   wrote off  $1.2 billion in
Guinea-Bissau’s debt in December and the  Paris Club  of creditors
erased an additional $256 million earlier this month.  Guinea-Bissau, with a population of 1.6 million people, is
one of the world’s poorest countries. The nation ranks sixth
from the bottom of the United Nations Development Program’s
 Human Development Index , which measures  life expectancy ,
education and  living standards .  To contact the reporter on this story:
