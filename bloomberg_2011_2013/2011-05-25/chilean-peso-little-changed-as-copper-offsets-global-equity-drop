Chile’s peso was little changed today
against the  U.S. dollar  as rising prices for copper, the
country’s main export, offset a fall in global equity markets
after U.S. durable goods orders dropped more than forecast.  The peso fell less than 0.1 percent to 472.16 per U.S.
dollar at 10:21 a.m. New York time, from 471.95 yesterday. It
lost as much as 0.3 percent and gained as much as 0.3 percent
earlier today.  “Global stocks don’t look so good after the economic data
in the U.S., but copper is higher due to Goldman Sach’s
recommendation yesterday,” said Ronald Volpi, head of spot
currency trading at Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised investors yesterday to buy
copper and other commodities on economic growth prospects, while
Deutsche Bank said today that copper will average $11,500 a
metric ton in 2012.  Copper for delivery in July rose as much as 2.7 percent in
 New York . The MSCI World Index of stocks fell as much as 0.4
percent.  Orders for U.S. durable goods dropped 3.6 percent in April,
more than economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast. It was
the biggest drop since October, reflecting less demand for
aircraft and disruptions in supplies of auto parts stemming from
the earthquake in  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
