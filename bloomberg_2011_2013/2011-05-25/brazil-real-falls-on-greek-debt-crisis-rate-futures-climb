Brazil ’s real declined as concern
that the Greek debt crisis may slow global growth weakened
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The real fell 0.3 percent to 1.6292 per dollar, from 1.6241
yesterday.  “The dollar is gaining against the euro and the market
here is looking abroad,” said Hideaki Iha, a currency trader at
Fair Corretora de Cambio e Valores in Sao Paulo. “This is
pressuring assets,” he said in a telephone interview.  Yields on some interest-rate futures contracts rose as
commodities increased for a second day. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index of commodities climbed 1.7 percent, after adding 1.2
percent yesterday.  The rebound in commodities is thwarting government efforts
to bring inflation back to its 4.5 percent target, said Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Banco Espirito Santo de
Investimentos in  Sao Paulo .  “If the commodities would help, inflation could converge
to the center of the target range. But rising commodities
increase the risk that this is not going to happen,” he said in
a telephone interview.  The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points.  The yield on the contract due in January rose two basis
points to 12.35 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
