Gulf Coast  gasoline rose as spreads
to Midwest prices near the lowest since 2008 gave traders the
chance to profit from shipping the fuel.  Mississippi River flooding has curtailed some vessel
operations. Exxon Mobil Corp. opened a portion of the docks at
its Baton Rouge refinery in Louisiana yesterday, Kevin Allexon,
a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. He declined to comment
on when the docks would be fully open and operational  The spread between cash prices in the Gulf and the Group 3,
or Midwest, hub opened to 20 cents on May 23, the widest level
since Feb. 27, 2008. Shipping gasoline to the Midwest hub has a
tariff of  3.4 cents  on the Explorer Pipeline, which runs from
the Gulf Coast to Tulsa,  Oklahoma  and Hammond, Indiana.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2.62 cents to 11.88 cents a gallon versus
July futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:42
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The July contract
traded at a discount of about 3 cents to June. Prompt delivery
gained 1.82 cents to $2.866 a gallon.  The same fuel at the Midwest hub slipped 1.25 cents to a
premium of 4.13 cents.  Regular gasoline in  Chicago  was unchanged at a premium of
32 cents a gallon. The Explorer pipeline costs about 4.4 cents a
gallon from the Gulf to Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
