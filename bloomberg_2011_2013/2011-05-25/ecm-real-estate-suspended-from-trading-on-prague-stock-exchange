ECM Real Estate Investments AG (ECM)  was
suspended from trading on the Prague stock exchange after the
Municipal Court in the Czech capital sent the developer into
bankruptcy proceedings.  The stock exchange suspended trading with all ECM’s
investment instruments for an “indefinite” period, the bourse
said on its website late yesterday. The decision applies to ECM
shares, bonds and warrants traded on the stock exchange, the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
