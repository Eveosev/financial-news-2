Total SA (FP)  of  France  plans to extend
its permits in Madagascar for one year to explore for oil at its
Bemolanga project, said Lionel Levha, managing director of Total
Madagascar Exploration.  The company asked for the extension at a meeting with the
Indian Ocean island nation’s Office for National Mining and
Strategic Industries on May 20, Levha said in a phone interview
from Antananarivo, the capital. A decision is expected by June
17, he said.  Total, based in Paris, manages the block after taking a 60
percent stake in the 6,500-square-meter (70,000-square-foot)
Bemolanga license in 2008. Total will explore for conventional
oil on the block because extracting heavy oil isn’t profitable,
African Energy Intelligence reported today, citing Levha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
