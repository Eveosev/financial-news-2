Morgan Stanley (MS)  Smith Barney, the
world’s largest brokerage, will let financial advisers market
themselves and share ideas with clients through social-
networking websites LinkedIn and Twitter.  The plan will start with about 600 advisers in late June
before expanding to the rest of the firm’s 17,800 brokers within
six months, according to an internal memo from Andy Saperstein,
who runs the brokerage’s U.S. operations.  Jim Wiggins , a
spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley, confirmed the
contents of the memo.  Wealth-management firms have been seeking ways to allow
brokers to use social media sites that are popular with
customers while satisfying regulatory demands that client
communications be captured and retained. Morgan Stanley brokers
will have communications pre-approved and the firm will keep
records of them, according to the memo.  “This will be a significant competitive advantage,”
Saperstein said in the memo. “We are the first major wealth-
management firm to announce a vendor solution for our advisers
to use key social-networking sites to market themselves and
share the firm’s intellectual content.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
