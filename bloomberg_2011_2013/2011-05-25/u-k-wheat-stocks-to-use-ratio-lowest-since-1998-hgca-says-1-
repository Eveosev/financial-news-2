The U.K. will have its lowest
stockpiles-to-use ratio for wheat since 1998 in the current
marketing year as imports of the grain decline, the Home-Grown
Cereals Authority said.  Stocks will come to 1.51 million metric tons for the year
that began July 1 and consumption will total 13.8 million tons,
HGCA data showed in a  report today . Available wheat is set to
fall 1.6 percent to 17.8 million tons as imports decline 15
percent from the prior year to 1.05 million tons, the authority
said.  The drop in available wheat “entirely reflects a reduction
in the estimated level of imports this season,” the HGCA said.
“The decrease is caused by an expected reduction in imports by
the milling sector.”  After consumption, the country will have about 3.95 million
tons of wheat, of which 2.44 million tons will be exported, the
authority said. Usage will total 7.11 million tons for human and
industrial purposes and 6.36 million tons for  animal feed ,
according to the HGCA.  The national wheat harvest will climb 5.7 percent in the
year to 14.9 million tons, it estimated.  Feed-wheat futures traded in  London  gained 79 percent in
the past year. Contracts in  Chicago , the world benchmark,
climbed 73 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
