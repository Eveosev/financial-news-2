China ’s money-market rate climbed to
the highest level in three months on speculation banks are
hoarding cash to meet regulatory requirements before the end of
the month.  The seven-day repurchase rate rallied for a fifth day on a
lack of cash flowing into the financial system. Central bank
notes and repurchase agreements worth 67 billion yuan ($10.3
billion) will mature this week, compared with 97 billion yuan in
the five days through May 20, according to Gao Qi, an analyst at
BNP Paribas SA in Shanghai.  “Banks want more deposits to meet the loan-to-deposit
ratio requirement at the end of each month,” said Gao. “The
liquidity squeeze will continue until more bills mature next
month.”  The seven-day repo rate rose 54 basis points to 5.3093
percent as of 11:23 a.m. local time, according to a weighted
average compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. The
rate touched 5.50 percent earlier, the highest level since Feb.
23.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, fell one basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.50 percent as of 11:30 a.m. in
 Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due January
2018 rose one basis point to 3.65 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  -- Andrea Wong . Editors: Ven Ram, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
