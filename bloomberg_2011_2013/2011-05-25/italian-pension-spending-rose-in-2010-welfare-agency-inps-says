Pension spending in Italy,  Europe ’s
fourth-biggest economy, climbed in 2010 as an aging population
filed more retirement claims, welfare agency  INPS  said.  The agency’s spending on pensions increased 2.1 percent to
177.4 billion euros ($250 billion) from 173.8 billion euros in
2009, INPS said in its annual report released in Rome today. The
agency paid about 18.8 million pensions in 2010, up from 18.6
million in the previous year.  After  Standard & Poor’s  said Italy’s debt rating was at
risk of a downgrade, the government on May 21 pledged to push
ahead with steps to balance the budget by 2014 and “intensify”
a structural overhaul of the economy. Those changes are unlikely
to affect pension costs because of a 2010 law that linked the
 retirement age  to  life expectancy  starting in 2015.  Italy also increased the retirement age for women working
in the public sector to 65 from 60, as requested by the European
Union. Italians, with the EU’s lowest birthrate of 1.3 children
per woman according to Eurostat, also have among the longest-
life expectancy. Men live to 70 on average and women to more
than 84, according to a report published in Feb. 2010 by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Pension spending last year amounted to 11.4 percent of
gross domestic product, the same as in 2009, INPS said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
