Russian loans categorized as
“problematic” or “hopeless” accounted for about 12 percent
of total lending, signaling the financial industry hasn’t fully
exited the crisis, according to the central bank.  “That’s really a lot,” First Deputy Chairman Gennady Melikyan told reporters today in  St. Petersburg . “Both for
overdue loans and loans in the 4th and 5th categories, that’s
much higher than before the crisis.”  Russian banks are increasingly lending to related parties
and raising the size of credit lines to companies, while
becoming less vigilant in gauging borrower quality,  Andrei Kostin , chief executive officer of VTB Group, the country’s
second-biggest bank, said last month.  Bank Rossii predicts lending will increase 20 percent this
year. Retail loans rose 14.3 percent last year after shrinking
11 percent in 2009, central bank data show. That outpaced the
12.1 percent increase in corporate lending after a 0.3 percent
gain in 2009.  The central bank groups “problematic” loans into the 4th
category, while “hopeless” credits are rated as category 5,
according to its  website .  Troubled debt in the two categories made up 3.5 percent to
4 percent of the total before the crisis, Melikyan said.  “I wouldn’t say that this concerns me, but when I look at
these numbers I draw the conclusion that it’s still very early
to say that we’ve entirely exited the crisis,” Melikyan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
