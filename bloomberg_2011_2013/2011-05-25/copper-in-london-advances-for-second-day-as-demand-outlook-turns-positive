Copper in  London  climbed for a second
day as banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to JPMorgan Chase &
Co. backed the metal’s prospects amid signs of improving demand.  Three-month delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
rose as much as 1.1 percent to $8,958 a metric ton and traded at
$8,949.75 at 3:12 p.m. Singapore time. Stockpiles of the metal
in Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses declined to the lowest
in more than seven months last week, a sign that demand may be
picking up in the world’s biggest consumer.  “As long as this is a growing market, there will not be
enough scrap available, there will not be enough concentrates,”
Christian Schirmeister, executive director at JPMorgan’s global
commodities group, said at a conference in  Singapore .  Copper for August delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained for a second day, closing 0.9 percent higher at 66,960
yuan ($10,309) a ton. July-delivery copper on the Comex climbed
as much as 1.1 percent to $4.056 per pound.  “Don’t expect copper prices to fall down to $5,000 or
something,” Schirmeister said yesterday. “Demand is stronger
than production, whether it’s mined or secondary.”  There was a shortage of the metal for a second month in
February as supplies trailed demand by 17,000 tons, the
International Copper Study Group said yesterday. The Lisbon-
based organization expects a 377,000-ton global copper shortfall
this year.  Goldman Sachs yesterday suggested buying oil, copper and
zinc, reversing last month’s call to sell commodities. Economic
growth will likely be sufficient to tighten key supply-
constrained markets in the second half, leading to higher
prices, the bank’s analysts wrote in a report.  Aluminum and zinc in London were little changed at $2,503 a
ton and $2,188 a ton, respectively. Lead increased 0.4 percent
to $2,496 a ton. Nickel fell 0.6 percent to $22,750 a ton, and
tin dropped 0.9 percent to $27,001 a ton.  To contact the reporter for this story:
