Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  Chief Executive
Officer Elon Musk said he expects the maker of electric Roadster
sports cars to remain independent and isn’t planning to sell his
stake in the company.  “I don’t think it’s a good idea to plan to sell a
company,” Musk said today in an interview with “Bloomberg
West.” “I don’t personally have any interest in selling. I
think there’s a lot of innovation we can bring to the car
business.”  Tesla, named for inventor Nikola Tesla, has said it will
likely continue to post losses for at least another year as it
prepares to build and deliver Model S electric sedans starting
in mid-2012.  Speculation  that the  Palo Alto , California-based
startup may eventually be acquired by a larger company has
persisted this year.  The company reported a first-quarter net loss on May 4 that
was narrower than analysts estimated as it boosted revenue from
battery packs and development work with partners  Daimler AG (DAI)  and
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  Sales more than doubled to $49 million.  “With partners like that, it’s very feasible to stay
independent for a long time,” said Musk, who owns about 27
percent of the company, according to Bloomberg data.  Tesla fell 10 cents to close at $26.72 at 5:20 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares are little
changed this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
