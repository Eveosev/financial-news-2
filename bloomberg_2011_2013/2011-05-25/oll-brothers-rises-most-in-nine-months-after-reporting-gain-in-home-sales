Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, rose the most in nine months after the
company reported increases in sales, prices and orders during
its second quarter.  Contracts signed for Toll Brothers homes climbed to 879 in
the fiscal quarter ended April 30, from 866 a year earlier, the
Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company said in a statement today.
The average price for the new orders rose to $570,000 from
$565,000 a year earlier. Revenue increased 8 percent to $319.7
million.  The rising sales helped the builder narrow losses in the
period, which includes the spring selling months that are
typically among the busiest for home orders. Toll Brothers had a
loss of $20.8 million, or 12 cents a share, for the quarter,
including about $32.5 million in writedowns. A year earlier,
the loss was $40.4 million, or 24 cents a share.  “The positive order and pricing commentary more than
offset the larger-than-expected impairment charges,” Michael Rehaut, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a note to
investors. He has an “overweight” rating on the shares.  Toll Brothers rose 56 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $20.83 at
10:39 a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. They
gained as much as 5.8 percent, the biggest intraday jump since
Aug. 25. The shares increased 6.7 percent this year through
yesterday, the largest gain in the 12-member Standard & Poor’s
Supercomposite Homebuilding Index.  U.S. homebuilders have struggled as foreclosures, which
sell at a discount, flood the market and make previously owned
homes more affordable than new properties. New homes sold at an
annual pace of 323,000 in April, up from 278,000 in February, a
low in records dating to 1963, the Commerce Department reported
yesterday. The average pace for the past 10 years was 823,000.  ‘Pent-Up Demand’  “As consumers better understand that prices are firming,
we believe they will gain confidence, which will help release
some of the pent-up demand that must be building in the
market,” Executive Chairman Robert Toll said in the statement.  Toll forecast sales of 2,300 to 2,800 homes in fiscal 2012
at an average price of $540,000 to $560,000. Three months ago
the company predicted a price range of $540,000 to $565,000.  The company wrote down $32.5 million for investments in
communities, land and joint ventures, compared with $42.3
million a year earlier.  The builder reported a profit for the three previous
quarters as it cut costs and reduced losses from impairments on
land acquired before real estate prices plunged. Toll, which
sells in 20 states, has diversified from suburban, single-family
homes by building urban high-rises and investing in distressed
real estate deals through its Gibraltar Capital and Asset
Management division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
