Bayer AG (BAYN)  and  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s
blood-thinner Xarelto was effective in preventing repeat strokes
in an analysis of high-risk patients from the Rocket-AF trial,
Bayer said today in a study presented at the European Stroke
Conference in Hamburg, Germany.  Patients who took Xarelto, known chemically as rivaroxaban,
showed a 13 percent lower risk of having another stroke than
patients who took the previous standard therapy warfarin, with a
similar risk of bleeding as a side effect and lower rates of
fatal bleeding, the Leverkusen, Germany-based company said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
