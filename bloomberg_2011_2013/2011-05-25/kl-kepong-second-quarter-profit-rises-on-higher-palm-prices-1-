Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd. (KLK) ,  Malaysia ’s
third-biggest listed  palm oil  producer by market value, said
second-quarter profit increased 73 percent, boosted by
contributions from plantations and manufacturing.  Net income climbed to 373.9 million ringgit ($122 million),
or 35.1 sen a share, in the three months to March 31, from 215.9
million ringgit, or 20.3 sen, a year earlier, the company said
in a filing to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange today. Sales rose
25 percent to 2.37 billion ringgit.  KL Kepong said it fetched an average price of 3,401 ringgit
per metric ton for palm oil in the quarter, compared with 2,509
ringgit a year ago. World production of palm oil may rise 6.6
percent to 48.6 million metric tons this year, after an
“unusually small” increase of 1.1 percent in 2010, researcher
Oil World said on April 19.  Earnings for the current financial year will gain on
“higher plantations profit due to prevailing favorable
commodity prices,” the Perak-based company said in the
statement. There may also be an “improved” contribution from
the oleochemical division, although the business remains
“competitive and challenging,” it said.  Profit from the manufacturing division more than tripled to
136.2 million ringgit as sales increased. The group will pay an
interim, single-tier dividend of 15 sen per share for the
financial year ending Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
