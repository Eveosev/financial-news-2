European stocks climbed as banks in
 Italy  rallied and investors awaited a report on U.S. durable-
goods orders to assess the strength of the economic recovery.
Asian shares dropped and U.S. index futures were little changed.  EON AG and RWE AG, Germany’s biggest utilities, rose more
than 2 percent after the Financial Times Deutschland reported
the government may scrap a tax on nuclear reactors. Hexagon AB
led a retreat in industrial shares, falling 4 percent. Cable &
Wireless Communications Plc plunged 8.6 percent after saying
it’s cautious on the outlook for its Caribbean operations.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.3 percent to 276.08
at 10:51 a.m. in  London , after earlier declining as much as 0.6
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
