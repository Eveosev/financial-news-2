Quintain Estates & Development Plc (QED) 
rose to the highest in more than a year in London trading after
the urban regeneration specialist said the value of its two
London projects increased in the fiscal second half.  The shares rose as much as 8.8 percent to 52.75 pence, the
highest since May 12 last year, and were up 2.5 pence, or 5.2
percent, at 51 pence at 12:58 a.m.  The real estate around Wembley stadium, where the local
municipality is building a new town hall, increased 1 percent in
the six months ended March 31, Quintain said in a statement
today. Property values on the Greenwich Peninsula increased 2.7
percent in the same period, the company said. Values fell in the
previous six months.  “It feels increasingly like Quintain’s time is coming,”
Osmaan Malik, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. who rates the
stock “neutral,” said in a note to investors today. “It is
now just up to management to deliver on its targets.”  The developer is seeking to double its assets under
management to 2 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) by 2013 to
increase revenue and lower risk. They rose 26 percent last year
to 1.27 billion pounds.  “It is a business model in transition,” Chief Executive
Officer Adrian Wyatt said in an interview. “We are in the right
assets at the right time.”  Quintain had a profit of 10.6 million pounds for the six
months ended March 31 compared with a loss of 16.6 million
pounds a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
