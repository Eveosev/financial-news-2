Trading volumes in  India ’s new market
for renewable-energy credits surged more than 70-fold in its
fourth session.  Buyers today purchased 18,502 renewable energy
certificates, or RECs, at the floor price of 1,500 rupees ($33),
according to data from  REConnect Energy Solutions Pvt. , an
Indore-based trader of the credits, sent to Bloomberg News. In
the previous session last month, only 260 were sold.  The credits trade once a month over the country’s two power
exchanges. Each credit represents 1 megawatt-hour of renewable
electricity fed into the transmission grid by a power plant.  India, in an effort to promote cleaner energy nationwide,
requires power distributors and industrial consumers to get as
much as 14 percent of their supplies from renewable sources.
Those companies can buy RECs to meet their obligations. In
places where wind, solar or biomass-based power isn’t available,
they can use the credits to meet targets set by state
regulators.  Regulators have set a floor price of 1,500 rupees and a
ceiling price of 3,900 rupees for credits earned by wind and
biomass plants. For more expensive solar power, the floor price
is 12,000 rupees and the ceiling is 17,000 rupees. Solar RECs
haven’t been available for sale yet as generation capacity in
the country is still ramping up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
