Greece  should hold a referendum on
whether to pursue more austerity measures to give politicians a
clear mandate, President of the Hellenic Federation of
Enterprises Dimitris Daskalopoulos said.  “Do we proceed down the road European prospects offer us,
with the terms and sacrifices required to stay in the
eurozone,” Daskalopoulos said in a speech in Athens yesterday.
“Or do we depart and proceed on our own, without the terms but
also without the billions of our partners?”  Prime Minister  George Papandreou , whose term ends in 2013,
is seeking political backing for a new round of spending cuts
and asset sales that run through 2015, as the euro region and
the International Monetary Fund discuss additional financing
Greece needs to avert a default. Greece got a 110 billion-euro
($154.4 billion) bailout from the European Union and IMF last
May in exchange for measures including wage and pension cuts and
higher sales taxes.  Government spokesman  George Petalotis  said May 18 that the
country isn’t headed toward early national elections and that
ruling party  Pasok  has the trust of the Greek people.  The government discussed the option of a referendum at a
Cabinet meeting earlier this week and is examining proceeding
with one for a new 60 billion-euro package from the EU and IMF
to cover its financing needs from 2012, Ta Nea newspaper said
today, without citing anyone. Papandreou has said Greece won’t
be able to return to bond markets in 2012, as planned in the
initial bailout.  Papandreou said “national understanding at this critical
time” is needed as Greece pushes to deal with its  budget
deficit  and rising debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
