The rand declined to its weakest
level in more than two months against the dollar as concern that
 Europe ’s debt crisis is deepening sapped demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  The rand depreciated as much as 1.2 percent to 7.0740 per
dollar, the weakest level since March 18. It traded 0.6 percent
down at 7.0292 at 6 p.m. in Johannesburg. The South African
currency declined 0.7 percent to 9.9159 per euro.  The euro dropped to an almost two-month low against the
dollar amid concern that Europe’s sovereign debt crisis will
spread as policy makers disagree over how to solve  Greece ’s
fiscal woes. South African stocks fell as much as 0.7 percent
after climbing the most in two weeks yesterday, while the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index slipped 0.8 percent.  “There is  risk aversion  in the market, investors are
getting out of emerging-markets and risky assets,” William van Rijn, a currency trader at Nedbank Group Ltd., said by phone
from Johannesburg. “The figures out of the U.S. are not looking
great.”  U.S. durable goods orders decreased 3.6 percent in April,
the most in six months, according to the Commerce Department’s
report today. U.S. stocks fell at the start of trading, as
measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Investors also sold rand on speculation a slow recovery in
 Africa ’s largest economy will persuade the central bank to keep
rates on hold this year. Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus
yesterday said the economy’s recovery is “fragile,” and
domestic demand poses little risk to inflation.  “I don’t think there was anything in what the  Reserve Bank 
said to indicate that there will be imminent rate action,”
Nedbank’s Van Rijn said.  Bonds were mixed. The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 slipped 9
cents to 121.34 rand, driving the yield up two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 7.57 rand. The 6.75 percent securities
due 2021 added 27 cents to 89.29 rand, cutting the yield four
basis points to 8.37 percent, heading for the lowest close since
Jan. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
