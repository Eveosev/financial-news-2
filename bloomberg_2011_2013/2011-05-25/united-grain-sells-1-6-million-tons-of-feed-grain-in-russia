United Grain Co. , the state-owned
Russian grain trader, sold 1.6 million metric tons of feed grain
from state reserves to farms and foodstuff producers in 52
regions across the country so far this year, the company said in
an e-mailed statement.  The government instructed the company in March to sell as
much as 2.4 million tons of feed grain from the stocks, which
the trader acquired in 2008 and 2009, according to the
statement. The government ordered the sales after the countryâ€™s
worst drought in a half century damaged crops last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
