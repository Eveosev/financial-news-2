Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ,  India ’s biggest
producer, gained the most in three months after agreeing to sell
its stake in Australia’s  Riversdale Mining Ltd. (RIV)  for A$1.06
billion ($1.12 billion.)  Tata shares climbed 3.6 percent, the most since March 1, to
573.05 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The shares have
fallen 16 percent this year, while the benchmark Sensitive Index
of the Bombay Stock Exchange declined 13 percent.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company,
gained almost full control of Sydney-based Riversdale after Tata
Steel said it would sell its 26.3 percent stake that has almost
doubled in value in less than four years. The transaction takes
Rio’s holding to 99.47 percent.  Rio’s acquisition of Riversdale gives the world’s second-
largest mining company reserves of coking coal in  Mozambique  as
prices for the steelmaking ingredient increase. Tata Steel had
said as recently as April 25 that it would continue to hold its
stake in Riversdale. Rio’s offer of A$16.50 a share is due to
close today.  Rio said in April it will seek to delist Riversdale from
the Australian stock exchange once the takeover is completed.
Its shares fell 0.7 percent to A$77.82 at the 4:10 p.m. close in
Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
