Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, said it discovered natural gas in deep
waters in the Gulf of  Mexico .  Pemex, as Mexico’s state-owned company is known, said its
Piklis-1 well holds about 400 billion to 600 billion cubic feet
of natural gas, according to an e-mailed statement today. At
1,928 meters (6,326 feet), Piklis is the Mexico City-based
company’s deepest exploration project and is located 89 miles
northwest from Coatzacoalcos port.  Pemex has found mostly gas in the 10 deep-water wells it
successfully explored since 2004, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News. The Mexico City-based company hasn’t yet
developed plans to exploit the deposits, which could boost gas
reserves by almost 1 trillion cubic feet, as it focuses on crude
production amid low natural-gas prices.  Carlos Morales , Pemex’s head of production and exploration,
said last month that plans to develop gas discoveries will
depend on the U.S. gas futures market.  Natural-gas futures in  New York  averaged $4.20 per million
British thermal units in the first quarter, a 16 percent drop
from a year earlier, as new wells from Wyoming to Pennsylvania
created excess supply in the North American market. Natural gas
for June delivery was little changed $4.345 per million British
thermal units at 9:15 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
