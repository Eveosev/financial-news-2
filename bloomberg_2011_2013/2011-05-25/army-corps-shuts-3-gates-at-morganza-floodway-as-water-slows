The  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  has
begun closing bays at the  Morganza  floodway as water flows along
the  Mississippi River  fall.  Three bays at the spillway, opened May 15 to protect Baton
Rouge and New Orleans from flooding, have been shut, according
to a press release the corps e-mailed today. Fourteen bays
remain open, discharging 140,000 cubic feet per second. The
corps estimated a flow rate of 300,000 cubic feet per second
before the bays were opened.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  opened a portion of the docks at its
Baton Rouge refinery in Louisiana yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
