Greece’s economy will emerge from a
three-year recession and return to growth next year in a
recovery that remains “fraught with risks,” the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development said.  The  Greek economy  will expand 0.6 percent next year, after
contracting 2.9 percent this year, the OECD said in its annual
economic outlook published in Paris today. Greece’s deficit, the
second largest in the euro region last year, will decline to 7.5
percent of gross domestic product this year, while the
 unemployment rate  will reach 16 percent.  “The path to sustainable public finances and renewed
economic growth is clearly fraught with risks,” the report
said. “Many things could go wrong in the international sphere,
including a further loss of confidence or a marked weakening in
export markets. The government can do little to influence these
factors. It can, however, continue to implement the program of
fiscal adjustment and structural reform. Indeed, a slowdown in
these areas would damage credibility, thereby aggravating the
already difficult situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
