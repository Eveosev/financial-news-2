Indonesia ’s rupiah fell, trading near
its lowest level in more than two weeks, as concern Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis is deepening deterred risk taking, curbing
appetite for emerging-market assets. Benchmark bonds were little
changed.  Overseas funds sold $129 million more local stocks than
they bought in the first two days of the week, exchange data
show, and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional stocks dropped
0.6 percent today. Belgium had the outlook on its AA-investment-
grade credit rating lowered to negative by  Fitch Ratings  on May
23. Fitch slashed  Greece ’s debt rating by three levels last week,
while Standard & Poor’s cut Italy’s credit-rating outlook.  “The overarching factor is still the  Europe  problem from
the sovereign debt issues to political uncertainties,” said
Joanna Tan, a Singapore-based regional economist at Forecast
Singapore Pte. “Risk-off sentiment is picking up again.”  The rupiah weakened 0.4 percent to 8,598 per dollar as of
4:16 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has gained 4.4 percent this year, the second-best
performance among the 10 most-traded Asian currencies.  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds rose was little
changed. The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 was
unchanged at 7.47 percent, according to closing prices from the
Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
