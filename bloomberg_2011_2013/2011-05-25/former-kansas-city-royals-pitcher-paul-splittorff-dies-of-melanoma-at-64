Paul Splittorff, who won more games
than any pitcher in Kansas City Royals history, died today due
to complications from melanoma. He was 64.  Splittorff passed away at the family home in  Blue Springs ,
 Missouri , the Royals said in a  statement . The team said last
week that Splittorff had been hospitalized for treatment of oral
cancer and  melanoma , a form of skin cancer.  Splittorff spent his 15-year Major League Baseball career
with the Royals, compiling a 166-143 record with a 3.71 earned
run average from 1970-84. The left-hander was 2-0 with a 2.68
ERA pitched in four American League Championship Series, all
against the  New York Yankees .  Splittorff worked as a television color commentator for the
Royals after his playing career. He was inducted into the teamâ€™s
Hall of Fame in 1987.  Funeral arrangements are pending, the Royals said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
