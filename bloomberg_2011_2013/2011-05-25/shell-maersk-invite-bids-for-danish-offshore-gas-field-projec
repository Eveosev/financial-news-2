Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and a unit of
A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S are offering a stake in their Elly and
Luke fields off  Denmark  to reduce costs, according to a
Schlumberger Ltd. oil-services marketing  website .  The partners are jointly offering as much as 60 percent in
the fields, which hold 180 billion cubic feet of recoverable gas
and will supply the fuel to Danish and Dutch gas transmission
systems, according to the posting.  The fields are located near the existing Tyra
transportation infrastructure. Shell and Maersk “will give
preference to bids that address all elements of the development
and exploration plans,” the companies said.  The area has a potential to add 850 billion cubic feet of
gas resources with additional exploration, according to the
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
