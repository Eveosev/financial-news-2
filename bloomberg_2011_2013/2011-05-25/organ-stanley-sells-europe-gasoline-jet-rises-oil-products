European jet barges for immediate
loading declined as an eruption at Iceland’s Grimsvotn volcano
reduced spot demand for  aviation fuel .  Morgan Stanley sold gasoil for the 10th straight session.  Light Products  Eurobob grade gasoline traded at $1,026 to $1,047 a metric
ton in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus bulletin board. That’s
lower than transactions at $1,035 to $1,050 a ton yesterday.
Ethanol is added to the grade to make finished fuel.  Morgan Stanley, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc were
sellers, while Cargill Inc., North Sea Group BV and Hess Energy
Trading Co. bought cargoes.  Gasoline’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , shrank to
$9.41 a barrel from $10.68 a barrel yesterday, according to data
from London-based broker PVM Oil Associates Ltd. Brent was 1.7
percent higher at $114.41 a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange as of 5:13 p.m.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent widened to $4.35 a barrel,
versus $3.48 in the previous session.  Middle Distillates  Jet fuel barges for immediate delivery traded at a premium
of $87 a ton to June gasoil on ICE, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window, which
ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. That compares with deals at $88
and $89 more than the contract yesterday. Air France-KLM and BP
sold to Shell and Vitol.  Premiums have fallen 7 percent since May 20 as an  ash cloud 
from the Icelandic volcano caused hundreds of flights to be
grounded and reduced near-term demand for aviation fuel. The
swap contract for June cargoes in northwest  Europe  rebounded by
as much as 2.23 percent today on speculation that the
disruptions would be shorter-lived than last year, when the
Eyjafjallajökull volcano closed European airspace for six days
and grounded 100,000 flights in April.  “The eruption is waning day by day and problems arising in
our neighboring countries as a result of volcanic ash should be
resolved quickly,” Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir said today in a statement.  Gasoil, the European equivalent of heating oil, advanced in
London. The contract for June delivery gained $17, or 1.9
percent, to $936.25 a ton on the ICE exchange.  The fuel is trading in contango, meaning contracts for
sooner delivery cost less than those expiring later. June
futures traded at a discount of $3.25 a ton to July. A contango
usually reflects a surplus of immediate supplies or declining
demand.  Gasoil barges traded at discounts of $3.75 to $5.50 against
June futures, the survey showed. That compares with deals at
$1.75 to $6 less than June gasoil yesterday. Morgan Stanley was
the main vendor. The bank has sold gasoil barges in every
trading session since May 12. Petrobras International Braspetro
BV, a unit of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, also sold, while Total,
Noble Group and Glencore International Plc. bought.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel’s premium over June ICE gasoil rose
to $23 a ton, compared with $20 and $22 a ton in the previous
session. Shell was the only vendor, selling four lots to
Mabanaft BV and Total SA.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded from $616 to $619, up from $603
to $605 a ton yesterday, according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
