West Africa’s regional stock
exchange, which returned to  Ivory Coast ’s commercial capital,
Abidjan, this month following the end of the country’s civil
war, is developing a market for small businesses, said Director
Jean-Paul Gillet.  “This new market is intended for small companies which
would like to be listed before entering the official market,”
he said in an interview May 23.  The Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres, which moved to
Mali in February following the seizure of its office by forces
loyal to ex-Ivorian President  Laurent Gbagbo , is also planning
to begin over-the-counter bond trading in a bid to boost the
exchange, Gillet said.  The BRVM has 38 companies and 33 corporate and government
bonds listed from the francophone countries of West Africa and
Guinea-Bissau, with the majority coming from Ivory Coast, the
group’s biggest economy.  The new programs have been delayed by Ivory Coast’s post-
election crisis, sparked when Gbagbo refused to cede power to
 Alassane Ouattara  after an election in November. The changes,
which were meant to be ready next month, may begin by the end of
the year, Gillet said.  The BRVM’s Composite Index rose 3.5 percent to 152.45 in
trading yesterday, according to the exchange’s website.
Senegal’s  Sonatel (SNTS)  SA, a telecommunications company, is the
biggest by market capitalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
