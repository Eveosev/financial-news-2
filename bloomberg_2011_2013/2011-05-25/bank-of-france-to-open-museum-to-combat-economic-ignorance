The Bank of  France  will convert a
former Paris branch into a museum in response to a self-
confessed national ignorance about how the economy works.  “In poll after poll, the French admit they know very
little about the economy,” Bank of France Governor  Christian Noyer  said today at a Paris press conference to present the
project. “As a central bank, we have a duty to educate the
public about what we do.”  The  interactive museum  will be housed in the 19th-century
gothic-revival Hotel Gaillard in western Paris. Built as a
residence, the building served as a Bank of France branch from
1923 until 2006, when the bank shut most of its offices as a
result of the adoption of the euro.  The museum will cost 30 million euros ($42 million) to
establish and will open in late 2014. The museum’s 3,000 square
meters (32,000 square feet) of exposition space will have
sections on the history of money, banking, the euro, trade and
famous economists.  The cost of tickets hasn’t been decided. Noyer said about
100,000 visitors a year are expected, half of them from school
visits. “We won’t present our views as the revealed truth, but
we won’t hide our ideas as central bankers about how the economy
works,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
