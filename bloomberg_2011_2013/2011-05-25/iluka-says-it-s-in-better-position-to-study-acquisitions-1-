Iluka Resources Ltd. (ILU) , the world’s
largest mineral sands producer, said the company’s increased
cash flow and shrinking debt put it in a better position for
mergers and acquisitions.  “Iluka is building a strong balance sheet, which better
enables us to contemplate acquisitions than has been the case
previously,” David Robb, managing director of Perth-based Iluka,
said today in a speech. “Within the mineral sands universe,
currently there is little we assess as particularly
attractive.”  The company expects “significantly improved financial
results over 2011 and 2012, and beyond” because of higher
prices, driven by demand from  China . It may restart idled
production capacity and bring new capacity on line because of
higher prices and supply deficits in some mineral sands products,
Robb said.  Iluka fell 1.8 percent to A$14.81 at 11:07 a.m. Sydney time
on the exchange.  Mineral sands first-quarter sales revenue was A$226
million ($237 million), compared with A$149 million a year
earlier, Iluka said April 12. The company had net debt of A$247
million at April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
