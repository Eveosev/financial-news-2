The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development cut its forecast for U.K. economic
growth and said the  Bank of England  should maintain stimulus to
support the recovery.  Gross domestic product will rise 1.4 percent instead of the
1.5 percent predicted in March, the Paris-based group said in a
report today. The economy will grow 1.8 percent in 2012, down
from a previous projection of 2 percent.  Consumers are under pressure from an acceleration in
inflation to 4.5 percent, more than double the central bank’s
target, and the biggest fiscal squeeze since World War II.
Policy makers held the key rate at a record low of 0.5 percent
on concerns an increase would undermine  consumer confidence  and
derail the recovery.  “Monetary policy should remain expansionary over the
forecast period to support activity in view of the tightening
fiscal stance,” the OECD said. “However, normalization of
 interest rates  will need to start during 2011 to stave off
significant increases in inflation expectations.”  The group sees  consumer spending  rising 0.2 percent this
year and 1.1 percent in 2012, while investment will rise 1.7
percent and 4.2 percent, respectively.  Government spending  will
increase 0.2 percent this year and fall 0.7 percent in 2012.  “The current fiscal consolidation strikes the right
balance and should continue in line with the government’s
medium-term plan,” the OECD said. “Nevertheless, consolidation
measures should be implemented in a way that minimises the
detrimental impact on short-term growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
