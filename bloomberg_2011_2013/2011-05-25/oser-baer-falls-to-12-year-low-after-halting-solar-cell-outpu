Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI) , the country’s
second-largest manufacturer of solar cells, closed at an 11-year
low in Mumbai trading after saying it temporarily halted
production of the electrical devices.  The company, based in  New Delhi , shut its solar cell
manufacturing line “a few weeks back” to carry out work aimed
at increasing cell efficiency, Moser Baer said in an e-mailed
response to questions from Bloomberg News. It declined to
estimate when the upgrade will be completed.  The stock, which has lost 39 percent this year, fell 1.7
percent to 37.9 rupees to its lowest close since Sept. 2, 1999.
The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index declined 0.9 percent.  Moser Baer, which makes solar panels using its cells, is
buying them now to meet its near-term requirements, it said,
without naming suppliers. The company has the capacity to
produce 90 megawatts of cells annually, according to its
 website . Moser Baer also aims to start a new, high-efficiency
100-megawatt cell production line “shortly,” the statement
said.  Solar cells, made out of silicon, convert sunlight into
electricity. Cells are assembled into panels, or modules, which
are used on rooftops or fields to generate power.  Moser Baer exports 90 percent of its modules to 32
countries, according to a  Feb. 15 statement . Its customers
include  Germany ’s  Solarworld AG (SWV)  and  Colexon Energy AG (HRP) , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
