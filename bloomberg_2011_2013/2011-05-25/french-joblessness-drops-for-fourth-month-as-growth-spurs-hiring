The number of jobseekers in  France 
fell for a fourth month in April as a surge in economic growth
buoyed employers’ confidence and spurred hiring.  The total of unemployed people actively looking for work
dropped by 10,900, or 0.4 percent, from March, the Labor
ministry said in a statement in Paris today. The total number of
jobseekers was 2.67 million.  France’s economy expanded at the fastest pace in almost
five years in the first quarter as households boosted spending
and companies stepped up investment. The increased investment is
translating into new jobs at companies including  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  and BNP Paribas SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
