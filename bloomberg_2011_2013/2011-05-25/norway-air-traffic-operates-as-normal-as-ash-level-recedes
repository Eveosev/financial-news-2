Flight operations in  Norway  will not
be affected by low concentrations of volcanic ash, Norwegian
airport operator Avinor said in a statement.  SAS AB (SAS)  expects to fly its routes in Norway without
cancelations, Knut Johansen, a company spokesman, said by phone.
SAS flew to Iceland yesterday and expects to be able to fly the
route again today, he said.  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA also expects to operate all
flights as normal, with the exception of the Oslo to Hamburg
route because of the closure of the Hamburg airport, Lasse
Sandaker-Nielsen, a company spokesman, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
