Tiffany & Co. (TIF) , the second-largest
luxury-jewelry retailer, might rally to $100 because investors
are likely to assign a higher value to its earnings, said Peter May, a founding partner of Trian Fund Management LP.  “There is enormous price appreciation from here,” May
said today at the  Ira Sohn Conference  in New York. He said
Tiffany is “one of the greatest brands in the world,” adding
that such companies are good investments because “they’re
consistent cash generators, and they tend to trade at higher
multiples.”  Tiffany is rallying for a third straight year, including an
11 percent advance to $68.86 since Dec. 31 through yesterday. It
traded for 24 times profit from the past 12 months, or 58
percent higher than the price-earnings ratio for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index. The premium reached a seven-year high of 64
percent in December.  Trian is the fourth-largest shareholder of Tiffany,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. May said the New York-
based company will probably boost earnings by about 15 percent a
year. It “came out stronger after enduring the worst luxury
recession on record,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
