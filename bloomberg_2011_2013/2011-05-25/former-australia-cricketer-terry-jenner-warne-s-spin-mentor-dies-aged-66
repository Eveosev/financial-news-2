Terry Jenner, the former  Australia 
Test cricketer who taught Shane Warne how to bowl leg-spin, died
after a long illness. He was 66.  Jenner, who played nine Tests for Australia in the 1970s,
passed away today at his home in  Adelaide , Cricket Australia
said. He never fully regained his health after suffering a heart
attack in April 2010, the Melbourne-based governing body said.  Jenner began coaching Warne at the Australian academy in
the early 1990s and advised him throughout a career that yielded
708 Test wickets, second on the all-time list. Warne, 41, paid
tribute to Jenner five days ago as he prepared to end his
playing career in the Indian Premier League.  “In the world of cricket, two people stand out,” Warne
wrote in the U.K.’s  Daily Telegraph . “There was Terry Jenner,
the coach who taught me the art of leg-spin bowling. And then,
in 1989, Terry introduced me to (former Australia captain) Ian
Chappell in the bar of the Hilton Hotel in Adelaide.”  Jenner is the only Australian Test cricketer to be jailed,
spending 18 months in prison in the late 1980s for embezzlement.
He had said working with Warne helped him turn his life around.  “Working with Shane changed everything,” Cricket
Australia cited Jenner as saying in 2010. “I was out there
earning the respect of people and the good news is that I felt
like I’d redeemed myself for the downs I had.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
