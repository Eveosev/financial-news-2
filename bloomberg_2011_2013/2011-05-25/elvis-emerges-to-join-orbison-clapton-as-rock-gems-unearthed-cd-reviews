Elvis Presley  squandered much of the
1960s and 1970s starring in bad movies and bloated shows.  The Elvis who emerged from the army in 1960 still was
devastated by the death of his mother, and convinced that he was
forgotten. His spirits were raised by the wild reception he got
on returning to the U.S. He entered a Nashville studio to make
his 10th LP, “Elvis Is Back!”  Boy, did he work hard. A new box set puts the case stronger
than ever, adding the 1961 collection “Something for
Everybody,” rare songs, and the singles “Stuck on You,”
“It’s Now or Never,” “A Mess of Blues,” “Little Sister”
and “Are You Lonesome Tonight?”  The inclusions soften the previously grating shifts among
styles, jumping from the jazzy “Fever” to the old-school rock
of “Dirty, Dirty Feeling” and on to blues, country, pop and
gospel. (In 1960, Presley also recorded “His Hand in Mine.”
Gospel ballads count among his most passionate.)  The King was reunited with his backing group Scotty Moore,
Floyd Cramer and D.J. Fontana and vocal quartet the  Jordanaires .
The songwriting is strong, starting with Otis Blackwell’s “Made
Me Know It” through to Lowell Fulson’s “Reconsider Baby.”
Elvis never hit such consistent highs again, even in the 1968
second comeback. Rating: *****.  Had he lived, Elvis now would be 76; the late Roy Orbison
75. “The Big O” blew people away with his distinctive voice,
at last showcased properly by the excellent “Monument Singles
Collection (1960-1964).” Forget the forbidding perma-frown
stare lurking behind dark glasses and just listen to “Only the
Lonely.” Rating: ****.  The slew of reissues has grown as record companies see the
potential in  baby boomers  repurchasing albums from their youth
padded with fresh material -- some essential, some not.  Pearl Jam ,  Primal Scream ,  Phil Spector ,  the Kinks  and
 Jayhawks  all have seen their best works reissued this year. I’m
looking forward to again hearing British indie band Suede
(reissues starting May 30) and the remastered  Pink Floyd 
(commencing in September).  Like many of the above, Simon & Garfunkel’s exceptional
“Bridge Over Troubled Water” stands on its own merits. The
1970 title now has been given an extra DVD, including a long-
lost CBS documentary, “Songs of America.” I’ll stick with the
original music, which I used to play for hours when growing up.  Rating: ***** for the album, *** for the latest version --
diehard fans will appreciate the time capsule.  Yet another release of “Layla and Other Assorted Love
Songs” by Derek and the Dominos also grafts on a host of
extras. The Eric Clapton classic from 1970 has been out at least
six times on CD. A 40th-anniversary “super deluxe” version
adds a hardcover book and the “In Concert” set. It’s too much
for many listeners, though some unreleased tracks, such as
“Matchbox,” are impressive. Rating: ****.  “Faith” was George Michael’s peak as the former Wham!
singer looked set for A-list stardom in 1987. After an erratic
personal and professional trajectory, we can look back and
marvel at his finest moments. “Father Figure” and “I Want
Your Sex” are remastered and crisper. There’s a dispensable
second CD with dance mixes and instrumentals. Rating: ****.  Presley, Orbison, Simon & Garfunkel and Michael are on Sony
Legacy. The Derek and the Dominos title is on Polydor as a 2CD
set with bonus tracks or a limited edition that adds vinyl
albums and DVD. Prices start from about $15; the large Clapton
box is about $80. Download fees vary across services.  Information:  http://www.royorbison.com/us/roy-collection ,
