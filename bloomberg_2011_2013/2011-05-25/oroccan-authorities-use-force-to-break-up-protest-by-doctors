Moroccan authorities used force to
disperse a demonstration by 8,000 doctors in the capital, Rabat,
wounding several people, one of the participants said.  Physicians working for the public sector gathered in front
of the Ministry of Health this morning demanding better  work
conditions , said Mohammed Hicham Benazzouz, a member of the
doctors’ union. They displayed banners reading “Doctors without
health insurance” and “Morocco is going ahead while medicine
is going backward,” he said.  “We demand health insurance for doctors, better work
conditions and the end of nepotism,” said Benazzouz, who
participated in the protest. “We want dignity, above all.”  Doctors have been on a strike for the past month, excluding
the  emergency services . Health Minister Yasmina Baddou met with
a few representatives in her office today, though no solution
was reached, Benazzouz said.  “She called us anti-patriotic and refused to listen to our
demands,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
