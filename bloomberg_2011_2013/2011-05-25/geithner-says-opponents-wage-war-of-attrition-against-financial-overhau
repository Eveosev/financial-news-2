Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said some politicians and bankers are waging a “war of
attrition” against efforts to strengthen regulation of the
financial system.  “You’re seeing some people run a war of attrition against

without identifying the people. “They’re trying to starve the
agencies that need resources.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
