Coffee farmers in  Brazil , where
production is set to fall this year, may still have “good”
revenue as the crop’s quality improves, University of Sao Paulo
research group Cepea said.  Output in the South American country will drop to 43.5
million bags this year from 48.1 million bags last year as trees
enter the lower-yielding half of a two-year cycle, the
agriculture ministry estimates. Brazil is the world’s biggest
coffee grower.  “In spite of the lower volume produced this year, the
revenue might be good this season,” Cepea analyst Margarete Boteon said in a report dated yesterday. Poor quality of some
beans in the 2010-11 marketing season limited producers’ gains,
she said.  A shortage earlier this year of fine cups, as higher-
quality beans are known, lifted the price of coffee traded on
Brazil’s BM&F Bovespa above that of beans on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York  for the first time since at least 1999, data on
Bloomberg showed.  Milder temperatures in Brazil’s coffee-producing region are
slowing maturation and fermentation, which may lead to better-
quality beans, weather forecaster Somar Meteorologia said two
days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
