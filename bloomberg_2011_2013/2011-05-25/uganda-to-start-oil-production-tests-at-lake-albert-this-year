Uganda will begin production tests at
its  Lake Albert  oil fields in September, part of a longer-range
program aimed at building a refinery that will begin operating
within three years, the Energy Ministry said.  The testing will involve “simulating production” to
determine the reservoir’s performance and volumes, and to
provide guidance for procurement of necessary equipment, Robert
Kasende, an assistant commissioner at the ministry, said in an
interview today in the capital, Kampala.  The east African nation will initially build a small
refinery with a capacity of 20,000 barrels of oil a day in the
first three years at a cost of $700 million, said Kasende. Daily
production will rise to 60,000 barrels in five years, with the
cost climbing to $2 billion, he said.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the U.K. explorer that discovered
commercially viable oil deposits in the Lake Albert basin in
2006 and will lead the production testing, has formed a
partnership with  Total SA (FP)  of  France  and China National Offshore
Oil Corp. to build a refinery. Uganda has an estimated 2.5
billion barrels of oil, with more than 1 billion already
discovered, according to Tullow.  The nation is “still discussing” financing options for
the refinery with the three companies, as well as with “many
others,” Kasende said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
