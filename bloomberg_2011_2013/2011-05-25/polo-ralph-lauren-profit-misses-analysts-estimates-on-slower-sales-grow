Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL) , the retailer
of its namesake brand clothing, fell the most in more than two
and a half years after it reported a 36 percent decline in
quarterly profit, missing analysts’ estimates.  Net income in the fourth quarter ended April 2 fell to
$73.2 million, or 74 cents a share, the New York retailer said
in a statement today. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had
estimated 79 cents a share on average.  Polo, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Ralph Lauren , and the rest of the apparel industry is facing higher
overheads because of rising cotton prices and increased pay for
workers who make clothes in  Asia .  Roger Farah, president and chief operating officer, said
today during an analyst call that the apparel maker is facing
“unprecedented inflationary pressures.”  Polo said gross margin -- the fraction of revenue left
after subtracting the cost of goods sold -- fell 2.2 percentage
points to 56.8 percent in the quarter ended April 2. Michael Binetti, a New York-based analyst with UBS Securities, had
estimated 57.5 percent. He recommends buying the shares.  Polo fell $14.69, or 11 percent, to $114.70, at 4:01 p.m.
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares
have risen 3.4 percent this year.  Revenue climbed 6.7 percent to $1.43 billion from a year
earlier, when the company reported net income of $114.1 million,
or $1.13 a share, according to the statement.  The company said its board of directors has authorized an
additional $500 million stock repurchase program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
