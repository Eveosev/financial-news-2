The  Vancouver Canucks  beat the San
Jose Sharks 3-2 in double overtime to reach the Stanley Cup
finals for the first time in 17 years.  Vancouver  won the best-of-seven National Hockey League
Western Conference finals by four games to one.  The Canucks trailed 2-1 until 14 seconds from the end of
the third period, when Ryan Kesler got the tying goal at Rogers
Arena in Vancouver. Kevin Bieksa then scored the winner for the
Canucks 10:18 into the second overtime.  Vancouver took the lead in the first period last night
through Alex Burrows.  Patrick Marleau  tied it in the second
period and Devin Setoguchi put the Sharks 2-1 ahead 24 seconds
into the third period.  Top-seeded Vancouver is chasing its first Stanley Cup
title, having lost in the finals in 1982 and 1994. The Sharks
have never reached the championship series in their 19 major
league seasons.  The Canucks will play the  Boston Bruins  or Tampa Bay
Lightning, who host tonight’s sixth game in the Eastern
Conference finals. The Bruins lead the series 3-2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
