Queensland defeated New South Wales
16-12 to take a 1-0 lead last night in Australian rugby league’s
State of Origin.  The Maroons, who are seeking a record-extending sixth
straight series victory in the annual interstate contest, lost
the lead with ten minutes left and trailed 12-10 before Billy Slater scored with seven minutes remaining at Brisbane’s Suncorp
Stadium.  Johnathan Thurston and Jharal Yow Yeh scored for
Queensland, only to go behind after early second-half tries from
Mitchell Pearce and Michael Jennings of New South Wales.  Queensland has now won 12 of the 16 matches since beginning
its streak of series victories in 2006.  Game 2 is scheduled June 15 at Sydney’s ANZ Stadium with
the best-of-three series returning to Brisbane on July 6 for the
final match.
