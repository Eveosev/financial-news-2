Brewin Dolphin Plc, a British fund
manager and stockbroker, said fiscal first-half profit declined
19 percent after it paid 6.1 million pounds ($9.9 million) to
compensate clients of an unrelated company.  Net income fell to 8.3 million pounds in the six months
ending March 27 from 10.3 million pounds in the year-earlier
period, the London-based firm said in a statement today. Funds
under management rose to 25 billion pounds from 23.2 billion
pounds six months earlier.  Brewin Dolphin made the contribution to the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme to pay clients of Keydata
Investment Services Ltd., an  investment company  that failed in
2009. The U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office this month said it had
“insufficient evidence to secure a prosecution” following its
investigation into Keydata’s collapse.  “We are pursuing an active role with the regulator and the
Treasury regarding the need to put in place proper mechanisms to
avoid in the future such substantial levies on your company and
our peers,” Brewin Dolphin said in a statement today.  The shares gained 2.2 percent to 169.6 pence at 1:25 p.m.
in London trading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
