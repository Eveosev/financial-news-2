The  Los Angeles  Lakers reached an
agreement in principle with former  Cleveland  Cavaliers coach
 Mike Brown  to be the successor to Phil Jackson, who is retiring
after winning five of his record 11  National Basketball
Association  titles with the Lakers.  “We’ve met with Mike and are very impressed with him,”
the Lakers said in a statement on their website last night. “We
have an outline for an agreement in place and hope to sign a
contract within the next few days.”  Brown, 41, agreed in principle to a four-year contract with
the Lakers worth $18.25 million,  ESPN reported , citing
unidentified league sources.  Brown was fired by the Cavaliers on May 24, 2010, after
recording a 272-138 record in five seasons with a team that was
built around  LeBron James . He guided Cleveland to the 2007 NBA
Finals and was named the NBA’s Coach of the Year after the 2008-
09 season. Brown emerged as the leading candidate after an
interview with Lakers executives over the weekend, ESPN said.  Brown, who has been working as an NBA analyst for ESPN
since he left Cleveland, would be the 22nd Lakers coach.  In Jackson’s 11 seasons in Los Angeles, the Lakers had a
610-292 record and never missed the postseason. Los Angeles
ranks second in NBA history to  Boston  with 16 championships and
has missed the playoffs five times in 63 years.  Brown started his NBA career in 2000 as an assistant to
Gregg Popovich in  San Antonio . He’s regarded as a defensive
specialist and his Cleveland teams ranked among the league’s top
10 in points allowed in all five of his seasons. The Cavaliers
allowed a league-low 91.4 points in 2008-09.  Brown was fired last year after the Cavaliers became the
first team in league history to post consecutive 60-win seasons
and fail to reach the NBA Finals.  Lakers assistant Brian Shaw and ex-Houston Rockets coach
Rick Adelman were also candidates to succeed Jackson, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
