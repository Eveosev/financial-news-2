Taiwan ’s dollar dropped to near its
weakest level in a month after foreign funds trimmed holdings of
the island’s stocks on concern a slowdown in  China’s economy 
will hurt demand for exports.  Global investors sold $906 million more local shares than
they bought this week, according to exchange data. Industrial
production in Taiwan grew at the slowest pace since September
2009 last month, according to a government report released May
23. A Chinese manufacturing index compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics fell to its lowest level in 10 months in
May, data this week showed.  “Foreigners have been selling a lot of Taiwan stocks,”
said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan
Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “The worry that a  China  slowdown
will affect Taiwan is definitely there.”  The Taiwan dollar weakened 0.3 percent to NT$29.009 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.020
yesterday, the weakest level since April 21.  China, including  Hong Kong , took around 40 percent of the
island’s exports in April, according to Taiwanese government
data. Factory output increased 6.9 percent last month from a
year earlier, less than a revised 13.7 percent in March and the
12.2 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Government bonds dropped. The yield on the 1.375 percent
security due March 2021, the most-traded government debt,
increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.438
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
