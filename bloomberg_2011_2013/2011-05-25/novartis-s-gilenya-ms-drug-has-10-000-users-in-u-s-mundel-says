Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Gilenya multiple
sclerosis pill is “doing very well” in the U.S., with more
than 10,000 patients using the treatment, the Swiss drugmaker’s
head of development said.  Novartis has been “very diligent” in tracking down side
effects and has found the compound’s safety profile to be
consistent with the Basel-based drugmaker’s data, Trevor Mundel,
the development chief, said today in a phone interview.  Gilenya was approved by U.S. regulators last year as the
first pill against relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
