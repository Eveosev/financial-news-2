El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL)  Ltd. said its
first-quarter loss more than doubled mainly because of the
rising cost of jet fuel.  Israel ’s national carrier had a loss of $42.9 million from
$16.5 million a year earlier. Revenue rose to $425.2 million
from $423.2 million, according to a statement to the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange today.  “First quarter results in 2011, with an emphasis on
expenditures, were influenced by a number of parameters,
primarily the average market cost of jet fuel that rose about 39
percent compared to the first quarter of 2010,” El Al Chief
Executive Officer Eliezer Shkedi said in an e-mailed statement.  Profitability was also affected by the increase in the
shekel against the dollar and the timing of the Passover
holiday, which this year fell in the second quarter, Shkedi
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
