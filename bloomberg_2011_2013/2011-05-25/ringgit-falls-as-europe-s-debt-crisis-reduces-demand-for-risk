Malaysia’s ringgit declined,
approaching a two-month low, as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
spreading weakened demand for emerging-market assets.  The ringgit fell along with other Asian currencies and
stocks after European Central Bank Governing Council member
Christian Noyer ruled out a restructuring of  Greece ’s debt. He
called the plan a “horror story” that would leave the nation
shut out of financing for years.  “The European debt crisis continues to weigh on
sentiment,” said Suzaizi Mohd Morshid, head of treasury at RHB
Islamic Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The ringgit is also taking
a breather because it’s had a good run recently.”  The ringgit dropped 0.2 percent to 3.0570 per dollar as of
10:13 a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency climbed 0.3 percent yesterday after posting its biggest
loss in a week on May 23. It reached 3.0655 on May 17, the
lowest level since March 17.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s Cabinet agreed to
spending cuts and sales of stakes in state-owned companies this
week. European Central Bank leaders and European Union policy
makers are clashing over how to prevent the region’s first
default, after 256 billion euros ($360 billion) in bailouts to
Greece, Ireland and  Portugal .  Malaysia’s government bonds were little changed after the
treasury announced it will sell 4 billion ringgit ($1.3 billion)
of five-year Islamic bonds on May 30, according to its sale
calendar.  The yield on the 4.262 percent note due September 2016 was
3.58 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
