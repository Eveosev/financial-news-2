German banks have “manageable”
risks related to Greek sovereign debt and the Mediterranean
country’s economy, according to  Fitch Ratings , which said it
doesn’t foresee any action on the lenders’ credit ratings.  “The worst consequence of any Greek sovereign default for
German and other European banks would be a sharp increase in
general  capital market  and creditor risk aversion at a time when
many banks are still in rehabilitation mode,” Michael Dawson- Kropf, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Fitch, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  is seeking political
backing for a new round of spending cuts and asset sales that
run through 2015, as the euro region and the  International
Monetary Fund  discuss additional financing  Greece  needs to avert
a default. The country got a 110 billion-euro ($155 billion)
bailout from the European Union and the IMF last May in exchange
for measures including wage cuts and higher sales taxes.  “A hypothetical 50 percent haircut of Greek sovereign
exposure would not result in such a depletion of banks’
capitalization that a rating action would automatically be
triggered, even for the more exposed banks,” Fitch said.
“These either have strong owners, sufficient profitability or
capital able to absorb potential losses without a structural
impact on their business model, funding or franchise.”  German banks cut their holdings in Greece to $34 billion in
the last quarter of 2010 from more than $40 billion, while the
French have reduced claims to about $57 billion from $63
billion, according to figures from the Basel, Switzerland-based
Bank for International Settlements.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s
second-biggest lender, said earlier this month that it would be
able to absorb any “stress” related to its sovereign-debt
holdings, such as a debt restructuring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
