Pakistan, the world’s fourth-largest
rice supplier, will take part in a tender to sell 50,000 metric
tons of the grain to  Bangladesh , according to a trader.  Bangladesh is seeking non-basmati parboiled rice, the
Directorate General of Food said yesterday. Bidders have until
June 6 to submit offers, it said.  “Bangladesh is a tight market, but we will have to
compromise our prices” in bidding for the contract, said
Rafique Suleman, a rice trader and former vice chairman of the
 Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan , by phone. “We have to
do something with the extra grain.”  Pakistan has 350,000 to 400,000 tons of rice left over from
the current crop. The country’s exports dropped 17 percent in
April to 343,000 tons from a year earlier, the exporters group
said on May 10, after floods destroyed crops worth an estimated
$3.3 billion last year.  Pakistan  sold 2.28 million tons of non-basmati rice and
955,000 tons of basmati rice this year through May 15,
according to Suleman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
