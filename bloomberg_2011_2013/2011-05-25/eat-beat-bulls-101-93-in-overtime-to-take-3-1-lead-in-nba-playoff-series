The  Miami Heat  beat the  Chicago  Bulls
101-93 in overtime to move within one win of advancing to the
National Basketball Association Finals.  LeBron James scored 35 points, his 40th career playoff game
in which he had more than 30 points, to help lift the Heat to a
three-games-to-one lead in the Eastern Conference finals.  “They make you fight for everything and you have to earn
everything,” James said in a televised courtside interview.
“We needed extra innings for this one, but it was good and we
came through.”  With the scores tied at 85, Chicago’s  Derrick Rose  missed
an 18-foot jumper as time expired at AmericanAirlines Arena in
Miami last night. The Heat then outscored the Bulls 16-8 in
overtime to secure their eighth straight postseason home win.  Chris Bosh  had 22 points and Dwyane Wade added 14 for the
Heat. NBA Most Valuable Player Rose scored 23 for the Bulls,
while Carlos Boozer and Luol Deng each had 20 points.  The Bulls turned over the ball three times as James, Bosh
and Wade dominated the extra five minutes. It’s the first time
this season that the Bulls have lost three straight games.  “Tough loss,” said Joakim Noah, who had six points and 14
rebounds for Chicago. “I give them credit. They battle hard.”  Miami can advance to the NBA Finals with a win at Chicago
tomorrow in Game 5 of the best-of-seven series.  1-3 Winners  The  Boston Celtics  were the last of three teams to rally to
win from a 3-1 deficit in the conference finals.  Boston achieved the feat against the  Philadelphia 76ers  in
1968 and 1981 before going on to win the NBA title. The
Washington Bullets also won from 3-1 down against the  San
Antonio Spurs  in the 1979 Eastern Conference finals.  Miami is in the Eastern Conference finals for the only time
since it claimed its sole NBA title in 2006, while Chicago has
reached the third round of the postseason for the first time
since it won a sixth NBA title 13 years ago.  The series winner will play the  Dallas Mavericks  or the
Oklahoma City Thunder for the NBA title.  The Mavericks, who lost to the Heat in their only visit to
the NBA Finals five years ago, lead the Thunder by three games
to one and can win the series with a victory at the American
Airlines Center in Dallas today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
