Wheat rose for the first day in five
in  Chicago  on speculation dry weather may have caused
irreparable harm to crops in France,  Germany  and the U.K., the
largest European producers.  Dry weather may cut U.K. grain and oilseed yields by as
much as 20 percent, Allan Wilkinson, head of agriculture for
 HSBC Bank , said in an interview on May 23. Drought in France and
Germany also will curb production and cause food costs at retail
outlets to surge, he said.  “There are still concerns that the long drought could have
caused irreversible damage to crops,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “Estimates indicate
losses on a scale of 7 percent to 12 percent for the wheat crop
in  France  and Germany.”  Wheat for July delivery rose 4.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$7.8425 a bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The grain jumped 70 percent in the past year and in
February reached $9.1675, the highest price since 2008.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris advanced 2.50 euros, or 1 percent, to 243.50 euros
($342.26) a metric ton.  Corn and soybeans gained for the first day in three in
Chicago as plantings in the U.S., the biggest exporter of both
crops, lagged behind the pace of recent years after wet weather
delayed fieldwork.  Below Average  About 79 percent of the U.S. corn crop was planted as of
May 22, the Department of Agriculture said in a report on May
23. That compares with 92 percent a year earlier and the average
of 87 percent over the previous five years. Soybean planting was
41 percent complete, down from a five-year average of 51
percent, the report showed.  “The weather concern is still around, buoying corn
prices,” said Han Sung Min, a trader with Korea Exchange Bank
Futures Co. in  Seoul . “If plantings don’t progress smoothly
because of rains, it will negatively affect crop conditions.”  Corn for July delivery gained 4.75 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $7.38 a bushel. The grain last month reached $7.8875, the
highest price since June 2008, and more than doubled in the past
year.  July-delivery soybeans increased 6 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $13.7825 a bushel. The oilseed climbed 48 percent in the past
year, helped by demand from  China , the world’s biggest soybean
importer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
