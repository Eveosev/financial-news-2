OAO Russian Railways,  Russia â€™s
railroad monopoly, may delay the planned 25 percent stake sale
in its unit OAO TransContainer to 2012, Kommersant reported.  The Moscow-based company may decide to move the sale from
fall 2011 due to losses after lower-than-expected tariff growth,
the Russian newspaper reported, citing a government official it
did not identify.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
