CIT Group Inc. (CIT) , the small-business
lender that emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, may be an
acquisition target for a larger bank, Centerbridge Capital
Partners LLC’s Jeffrey Aronson said.  The firm could attract interest from institutions such as
Wells Fargo & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc, US Bancorp and Toronto-
Dominion Bank, Aronson said today in a speech at the Ira Sohn
Conference in New York.  CIT may be worth $65 a share in an acquisition, said
Aronson, whose private-equity firm is one of CIT’s largest
shareholders. New York-based Centerbridge owns about 5.9 million
shares, or 2.9 percent of CIT, making it the lender’s eighth-
biggest stockholder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Curt Ritter , a spokesman for New York-based CIT, said in an
e-mail that the company doesn’t comment on market speculation.  CIT rose as much as 2.6 percent after Aronson’s comments.
The stock climbed 78 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $41.64 at 4:15
