Swiss stocks pared losses as concern
eased that  Europe ’s debt crisis will spread, offsetting a U.S.
report showing that durable goods orders in the world’s largest
economy declined in April more than forecast.  The Swiss Market Index of the biggest and most actively
traded companies declined less than 0.1 percent to 6,453.53 at
3:49 p.m. in Zurich. The gauge has still climbed 7.2 percent
since its low for this year on March 16 as seven out of 10
companies posted earnings that beat estimates. The broader Swiss
Performance Index slipped 0.1 percent today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
