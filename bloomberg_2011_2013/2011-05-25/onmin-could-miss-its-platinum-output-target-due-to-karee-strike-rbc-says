Lonmin Plc (LON) , the world’s third-largest
platinum producer, may fall short of its annual output target by
about 2 percent if a strike at its Karee mine in  South Africa 
continues, RBC Capital Markets analyst  Leon Esterhuizen  said.  Missing the goal of producing 750,000 ounces of platinum in
the year to Sept. 30 is “probably a given,” he said today. The
target will probably be cut to about 730,000 or 735,000 ounces
if Karee doesn’t resume output in the next two weeks, he said.  Platinum companies have been boosting production to take
advantage of rising prices for the metal, used in jewelry and in
devices to control vehicle emissions. Platinum for immediate
delivery in London has risen 16 percent in the past year to
$1,779.25 an ounce as of 5:05 p.m. local time. Ravin Maharaj, a
Lonmin spokesman, declined to comment on the strike’s effect.  Karee, part of Lonmin’s  Marikana operation , produces about
1,500 ounces of the metal a day, according to RBC’s Esterhuizen.
Production at the mine has been suspended since the night shift
of May 17 when 9,000 workers began their strike.  National Union of Mineworkers  members are acting because of
an internal dispute between the union’s office in Rustenburg and
leadership of its Karee branch, rather than any grievance with
the company, NUM spokesman  Lesiba Seshoka  said on May 20.  “The whole industry needs to worry,” said Esterhuizen by
phone from London. “There’s a growing sense of militancy and
aggressiveness in the labor unions.”  Lonmin, which yesterday began firing the striking workers,
has also re-hired some, Seshoka said by mobile phone. Lonmin and
the union are meeting in Rustenburg today for talks, he said.  Lonmin gained 0.1 percent to 1,496 pence by the 4:30 p.m.
close of  London  trading, giving the company a value of 3 billion
pounds ($4.9 billion). Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Impala
Platinum Ltd. are the largest producers of the metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
