Tanzania’s current account deficit
widened to $2.3 billion in the 12 months through March as the
cost of oil imports rose, the East African nation’s central bank
said.  The deficit widened from $2.2 billion in the 12 months
through February, Dar es Salaam-based Bank of Tanzania said in
the monthly economic review for April.  “The increase in the goods import bill was mainly driven
by an increase in  oil prices  in the world market as the volume
remained almost unchanged,” the bank said.  Exports of gold rose to $1.7 billion from $1.3 billion in
the year-earlier period, while imports, of which oil accounts
for 30 percent, increased 18.2 percent to $9.2 billion,
according to the report. Foreign currency reserves climbed to
$3.6 billion at the end of March from $3.4 million the year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
