Slovakia’s economy may expand 3.6
percent this year and 4.4 percent in 2012, driven by external
demand and business investment, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.  Inflation will probably increase to an annual rate of 3.9
percent this year before slowing to 2.9 percent in 2012, the
Paris-based organization said in its May 2011 Economic Outlook
released today. The Slovak budget deficit is forecast to narrow
to 5.1 percent of gross domestic product this year on planned
consolidation measures and to 4 percent in 2012, it said.  “Growth will continue to be mainly driven by exports, as
foreign demand is expected to remain strong,” the OECD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
