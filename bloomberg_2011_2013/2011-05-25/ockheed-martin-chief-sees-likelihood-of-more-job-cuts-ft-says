Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s
biggest military equipment maker by revenue, will probably cut
more jobs as it seeks reduce costs, according to Chief Executive
Officer  Robert Stevens , the Financial Times reported.  The company employs 126,000 people, down from 146,000 two
years ago, and that number “may well continue to decline,” the
newspaper cited him as saying.  Stevens said the U.S. Defense Department’s demands that
products become more affordable inevitably means some jobs will
be cut, the FT added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
