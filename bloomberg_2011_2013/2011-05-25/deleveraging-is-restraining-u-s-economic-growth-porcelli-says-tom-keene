The U.S. has yet to recover from the
credit crunch that crippled the economy and that’s continuing to
restrain growth, said  Tom Porcelli , chief U.S. economist at RBC
Capital Markets Corp. in New York.  “You have an environment where deleveraging is taking
place and actually more specifically is still ongoing,”
Porcelli said today in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  “That’s true not just for individuals but it’s true for
the banking industry in general,” Porcelli said. “The one
thing that is really striking to us is there’s simply no demand
for loans at this point and that’s one of the reasons why we can
continue to expect such a growth backdrop.”  Lenders have been retreating to the safety of Treasury
bills, notes and bonds, according to statistics from the  Federal
Reserve  earlier this month, a sign of sluggish growth and
dormant loan demand.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
