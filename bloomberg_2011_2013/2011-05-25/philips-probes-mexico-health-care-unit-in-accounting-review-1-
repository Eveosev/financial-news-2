Royal Philips Electronics NV is
investigating its health-care unit in  Mexico  for possible
accounting irregularities between 2008 and 2009, a week after
saying it is looking into a possible bribery case in Poland.  The Dutch company doesn’t expect the investigation in
Mexico to lead to a restatement of earnings for the company as a
whole, spokesman Steve Klink said by telephone today. The
world’s largest maker of patient-monitoring systems initiated
the investigation in Mexico, he said.  Philips doesn’t break out earnings or sales for Mexico, and
only reports regional figures for its business units. Health
care sales in  North America  reached 3.9 billion euros ($5.48
billion) last year. Dutch newspaper Eindhovens Dagblad reported
the Mexican probe earlier today, citing confidential documents.  Last week, the Amsterdam-based company said it started an
internal investigation into alleged bribery at its health-care
unit in  Poland .  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
