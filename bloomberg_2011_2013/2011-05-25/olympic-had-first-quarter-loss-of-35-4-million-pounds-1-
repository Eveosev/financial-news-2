Olympic Group Financial Investments (OLGR) ,
an Egyptian appliances manufacturer, had a first-quarter net
loss of 35.4 million Egyptian pounds ($6 million) compared with
53.1 million pounds profit in the year-earlier period, the
Cairo-based company said in a regulatory filing today.  Shares of Olympic Group advanced 0.3 percent to 34.95
pounds at 2:20 p.m. in Cairo, heading for the highest close in
more than three weeks. That gave the company a market value of
2.1 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
