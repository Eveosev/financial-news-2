Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., a Kenyan
retailer, said profit before tax in the year through June will
rise 25 percent on growth in customers, products and outlets.  Uchumi , whose shares will resume trading on the  Nairobi
Stock Exchange  on May 31, expects profit to grow to 1.93 billion
shillings ($22 million) from 1.54 billion shillings a year
earlier, Managing Director Jonathan Ciano told reporters today
in the capital, Nairobi. Profit before tax to June 2012 is
forecast to advance to 2.56 billion shillings, he said.  “Any increment that we have will be coming from those
three,” Ciano said.  The retailer, whose shares were suspended from trading on
the stock exchange from June 2006, reported a 14 percent
increase in sales to 9.8 billion shillings in the nine months
through March compared with a year earlier, Ciano said. The
company had 18 million customers last year, and forecasts 20
million in 2011 and 22.2 million next year, he said.  Uchumi went into receivership in June 2006 with debts of
2.2 billion shillings, of which 957 million shillings was owed
to  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB)  and PTA Bank Ltd. The receivership
ended on March 4, 2010, after most of the company’s debts were
cleared and others converted into shares.  Uchumi has outstanding loans of 243 million shillings,
which it plans to repay fully by 2014.  Share Trading  “Only the government loan is remaining,” Ciano said.  In view of the forecasts, Uchumi shares, which last traded
at 14.50 shillings, should be worth at least 25 shillings,
Michael Gichohi, chief executive officer of Nairobi-based Suntra
Investment Bank Ltd., said in an interview today.  “We will have more buy orders than sell orders,” said
Gichohi, who is also chairman of  Kenya Association of
Stockbrokers and Investment Banks . “ It is going to stimulate
the market because it is a major turnaround”.  Chris Kirubi, a former chairman of the retail chain,
together with 13 other people, including former directors, were
yesterday acquitted of selling one of the retail chain’s outlets
at 147 million shillings and leasing back the premises to Uchumi
for 1.7 million shillings per month in 2004, Nairobi-based
 Business Daily  reported.  Yesterday’s acquittals follow last year’s dismissal of two
cases of  insider trading  against former Kenya Commercial Bank
Ltd. chief executive Terry Davidson and former Uchumi General
Manager Bernard Kibaru, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
