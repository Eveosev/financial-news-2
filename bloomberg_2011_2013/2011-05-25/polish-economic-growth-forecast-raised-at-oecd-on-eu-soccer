Poland’s economic-growth forecast was
raised to 3.9 percent from 3 percent at the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, which cited public works
projects financed by the European Union and preparations for
next year’s European soccer championships.  Gross domestic product will grow 3.8 percent in 2012, the
same rate as last year, according to the  OECD ’s preliminary
economic outlook, released today. The November estimate for next
year’s growth was 3.5 percent.  "The Polish economy is projected to expand by close to 4
percent in 2011 and 2012 thanks to strong public investment in
2011, partly related to EU-financed infrastructure projects and
the 2012 football championships, a recovery in business
investment in 2012 and robust private consumption," the OECD
said in the report.  Poland’s general government budget deficit will narrow to
5.8 percent of GDP this year and 3.7 percent next year, from 7.9
percent in 2010, the OECD said. It previously estimated 6.7
percent for this year and 4.8 percent for 2012.  Inflation will accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2011, before
slowing to 3.1 percent next year, according to the report.
Consumer prices rose 2.6 percent last year.  "Monetary tightening should be continued towards a neutral
stance both to tame inflation expectations and forestall second-
round effects from the commodity price increases, and also
because strong growth will soon result in pressure on productive
capacity," the OECD said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
