Swiss stocks slid as a U.S. report
showed that durable goods orders in the worldâ€™s largest economy
declined in April more than forecast.  OC Oerlikon Corp. and Meyer Burger Technology AG,
both manufacturers of solar-power equipment, retreated more than
2 percent.  The Swiss Market Index of the biggest and most actively
traded companies declined 0.2 percent to 6,444.34 at 3:23 p.m.
in Zurich. The gauge has still climbed 7 percent since its low
for this year on March 16 as seven out of 10 companies posted
earnings that beat estimates. The broader Swiss Performance
Index also slipped 0.2 percent today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
