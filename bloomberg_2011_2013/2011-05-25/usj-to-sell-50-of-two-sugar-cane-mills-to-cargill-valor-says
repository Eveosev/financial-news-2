Grupo USJ, the Brazilian sugar cane
processor, may sell a 50 percent stake in two of its mills in
Goias state to U.S. agribusiness Cargill Inc., Valor Economico
reported.  Two other sugar and ethanol producers, Raizen SA and Nova
Fronteira Bioenergia SA, are also interested in the facilities,
one of which is under construction, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper  said  today, citing people familiar with the deal whom
it did not name.  Cargill, based in  Minneapolis , will probably clinch the
deal because, unlike its competitors, it would be willing to
take a non-controlling stake in the projects, a precondition to
the sale, Valor reported. A decision should be announced in the
next few days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
