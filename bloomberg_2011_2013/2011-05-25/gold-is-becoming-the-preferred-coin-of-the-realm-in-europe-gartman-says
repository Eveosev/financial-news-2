Gold has become the preferred “coin
of the realm” during the European sovereign-debt crisis as
investors seek to protect themselves from a weakening euro,
 Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter, said in his report today.  “Dollars are a reasonable alternative, and increasingly
the Swiss franc is one also,” Gartman said. “But the ‘trump
card’ currency of choice is gold and in all likelihood it shall
become even more readily embraced, not less so in the days and
weeks ahead as  Europe ’s problems worsen.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
