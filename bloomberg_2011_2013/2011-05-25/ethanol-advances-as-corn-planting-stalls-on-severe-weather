Ethanol futures advanced on bets that
more rain this week will further delay U.S. corn planting,
leading to higher production costs for the grain-based additive.  Ethanol moved higher with corn, which rose on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade as storms stretching from  Iowa  to Ohio may bring
rain by tomorrow. Planting is behind the normal pace because of
excess rain, with some of the biggest delays in Ohio,  North
Dakota  and Indiana.  “Some farmers are starting to talk about taking the
insurance money if they can’t get this corn planted by June 5,”
said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in
Chicago. “They may just take the insurance payment and not
plant anything this year.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 2.1 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.632 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price ranged from $2.614 to $2.638. Prices are 67 percent higher
than a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 2.5 cents to $2.625 a
gallon in Chicago, 2 cents to $2.745 on the  Gulf Coast , 3.5
cents to $2.74 on the West Coast, and 1 cent to $2.725 in  New
York .  Corn futures for July delivery gained 9 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $7.4225 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
