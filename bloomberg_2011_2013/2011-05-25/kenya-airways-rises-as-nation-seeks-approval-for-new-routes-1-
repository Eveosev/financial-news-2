Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
Africaâ€™s third-biggest airline, climbed for a second day after
the Kenyan government asked  India  to allow the airline to begin
flying to new routes.  The shares rose 75 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 41 shillings
by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, its highest level since Feb. 14.  The airline currently flies to Mumbai, according to a
statement e-mailed by the Kenyan presidency today.  Kenya  is
asking for its national carrier to be allowed flights to Delhi
and the state of Gujarati.  The Nairobi-based carrier plans to double the size of its
fleet to 60 planes in the next four years, and will begin
flights to seven new destinations, including the capitals of
Nigeria, Chad, Togo and  Burkina Faso , as well as Mauritius and
the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah this year, Chief Executive
Officer Titus Naikuni said April 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
