SEB AB, Sweden’s third-largest bank
by market value, hired Per Nordstrom as head of capital markets
for Asia as it boosts coverage of trade-related services in the
offshore yuan market.  Nordstrom will be based at SEB’s “new branch in  Hong Kong 
and will be key in the launch of yuan-related products to our
customers,” Stockholm-based SEB spokeswoman, Elisabeth
Lennhede, said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg News
queries.  Nordstrom was previously Asia head of euro medium-term
notes at  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , based in Hong Kong, and helped
with the bank’s marketing and sale of so-called dim sum bonds,
which are yuan-denominated notes sold in the city.  SEB was the first Nordic bank to offer trade-related
services for the offshore yuan market, according to its  website .
Its goal in  China  is to “become more of a house bank for mid-
corps and smaller large corporate clients,” Fredrik Hahnel,
head of SEB in Shanghai, said in a May 20  media release .  Standard Chartered spokeswoman Valerie Tay confirmed in an
e-mail that Nordstrom had left the London-based bank. Nordstrom
could not be contacted immediately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
