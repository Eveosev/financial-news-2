Following is the text detailing
forecasts for percentage changes in annual food prices,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture :  In 2011, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all food is
projected to increase 3 to 4 percent. Food-at-home (grocery
store) prices are forecast to rise 3.5 to 4.5 percent, while
food-away-from-home (restaurant) prices are forecast to increase
3 to 4 percent. Although food price inflation was relatively
weak for most of 2009 and 2010, cost pressures on wholesale and
retail food prices due to higher food commodity and energy
prices, along with strengthening global food demand, have pushed
inflation projections for 2011 upward.  The all-food CPI increased 0.8 percent between 2009 and 2010,
the lowest food inflation rate since 1962. Food-at-home prices
increased by 0.3 percent--the lowest annual increase since 1967-
-with cereal and bakery product prices declining 0.8 percent and
processed fruit and vegetable prices dropping 1.3 percent. Food-
away-from-home prices rose 1.3 percent in 2010, the lowest
annual increase for restaurant prices since 1955.  The CPI for all food increased 0.4 percent from February March
to April 2011, increased 0.7 percent from February to March
2011, and is now 3.2 percent above the April 2010 level. The
food-at-home CPI increased 0.4 percent in April 2011 and is up
3.9 percent from last April, while the food-away-from-home index
was up 0.3 percent in April 2011 and is 2.1 percent above last
April. Food commodity and energy price increases over the past
10 months have caused most of the recent increases in grocery
store prices. The all-items CPI was up 0.6 percent in April,
mostly due to higher food and energy prices, and is 3.2 percent
above the April 2010 level.  Beef prices increased 1.2 percent in April and are 10.4 percent
above last April, with steak prices up 8.2 percent and ground
beef prices up 12.1 percent. Pork prices decreased 0.3 percent
in April but remain 10.4 percent above last April’s level.
Poultry prices increased 0.9 percent in April and are 2.3
percent above prices last year at this time, with chicken prices
up 1.8 percent and other poultry prices (including turkey) up
4.1 percent. As commodity prices and input costs have risen over
the past 10 months, beef and pork prices are now significantly
higher than in 2010. Increased inflation for beef and pork
products is expected for most of 2011, as reflected in ERS’s
forecasts--beef prices are now projected to increase 7 to 8
percent and pork prices 6.5 to 7.5 percent in 2011.  Egg prices increased 0.7 percent in April 2011, marking the
first price increase in four months. Egg prices are now 4.8
percent above the April 2010 level.  Dairy prices were up 1.7 percent from March to April 2011,
compared with a 1.3-percent increase from February to March
2011. Dairy prices are now 6.3 percent above the April 2010
level. Within the dairy category, prices changed as follows in
April: milk prices were up 2.2 percent and are 10.9 percent
above last April’s prices; cheese prices were up 2.2 percent and
are 4.6 percent above last April’s level; ice cream and related
product prices were up 1.5 percent and are 5.1 percent above
last April’s level; and butter prices decreased 1.0 percent this
month and are 16.2 percent above last April. In 2010, dairy
prices were up only 1.1 percent from 2009 (following a 6.4-
percent decline from 2008 to 2009). However, higher projected
prices for farm milk in 2011 have led ERS to revise its forecast
upward to 5 to 6 percent for retail dairy product prices in
2011.  Fresh fruit prices increased 0.8 percent in April, and the fresh
fruit index is up 1.6 percent overall from last year at this
time, with apple prices up 1.0 percent, banana prices down 0.2
percent, citrus fruit prices down 2.1 percent (after a mostly
seasonal 8.5-percent increase from February to March 2011), and
other fresh fruit prices up 2.2 percent. Fresh fruit prices fell
in 7 of the past 15 months, leading to an overall fresh fruit
price decline of 0.6 percent in 2010. However, current forecasts
predict some price inflation for fruit prices in 2011. The fresh
vegetable index decreased 3.5 percent in April, due in large
part to a seasonal shift away from those crops affected by harsh
winter weather. Since last year at this time, fresh vegetable
prices are up 4.5 percent, with potato prices up 13.4 percent,
lettuce prices up 9.9 percent, tomato prices up 9.7 percent, and
other fresh vegetable prices down 1.2 percent. Processed fruit
and vegetable prices decreased 0.6 percent in April and are 0.9
percent above the April 2010 level.  Cereal and bakery product prices were up 0.2 percent from March
to April 2011 and are up 2.2 percent from last year at this
time, with bread prices up 4.8 percent and breakfast cereal
prices up 1.7 percent over the past year. Although cereal and
bakery product prices declined 0.8 percent overall in 2010,
higher wheat commodity costs should begin to affect cereal and
bakery product prices over the next few months, causing prices
to rise 3.5 to 4.5 percent overall in 2011. Sugar and sweets
prices were down 0.8 percent in April and are 1.5 percent above
last April. Within the nonalcoholic beverages category, prices
changed as follows in April: carbonated drink prices were down
0.7 percent and are up 0.9 percent from April 2010; coffee
prices were up 3.6 percent and are up 13.8 percent from last
April; and nonfrozen noncarbonated juices and drinks prices were
up 1.0 percent in April and are up 1.2 percent from the April
2010 level.  ERS regularly updates and provides food price forecasts for the
short-term period of 12 to 18 months. These forecasts are a
composite of formal model results and judgment. Monthly Bureau
of Labor Statistics’ indexes for all food, food away from home,
food at home, and 15 food at home categories are used in
conjunction with ERS analysis to adjust the current short-term
forecasts for each of the food categories. See ERS data on the
CPI for food and CPI forecasts.  ERS food price forecasts are developed through a three-step
process:  First, USDA develops its 10-year baseline projections. The
baseline provides long run projections for the agricultural
sector and covers agricultural commodities, agricultural trade,
and aggregate indicators of the sector, including farm income
and food prices. The baseline projections are a conditional
scenario with no shocks and are based on specific assumptions
regarding the macroeconomy, agricultural policy, the weather,
and international developments. In particular, the baseline
incorporates provisions of the Farm Security and Rural
Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Act) and assumes that current
farm legislation remains in effect through the projections
period. For the actual projections, see the USDA Agricultural
Baseline Projections Briefing Room.  In the second step, ERS analysts develop the short-term
forecasts that incorporate the most recent baseline assumptions
and current information on market conditions and expectations,
weather patterns, commodity prices and supplies, and expected
consumer demand for specific foods.  In the third step, these short-term forecasts are compared with
a computer-based Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) model that determines whether the ERS short-term
forecast falls within an expected statistical range of a 95-
percent confidence interval.  Food price forecasts developed using this three-step process are
subject to revision if the conditions on which they are based
should change significantly. Projections could be affected by
changes, for example, in the feed grain crop outlook; in export
markets, especially for meat items; in nonfarm markets; or in
weather-related crop conditions in major fresh fruit and
vegetable growing areas.  Historical data indicate that fresh fruits and vegetables and
egg prices are the most volatile food prices that ERS tracks.
Grain price changes affect the price of meats, poultry, eggs,
and dairy products more than the prices of other food items and
to a lesser extent cereals and bakery products. Because these
items account for more than half of the at-home food dollar,
price changes for these categories can significantly affect the
 Consumer Price Index  (CPI) for food at home.  SOURCE:  U.S. Department of Agriculture  To contact the reporter on this story:
