Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  started a service that allows
customers of the three lenders to transfer money using only an
e-mail address or cell phone number.  The nationwide initiative, called “clearXchange,” may
include more financial institutions and other ways to send
money, according to a statement today from San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo.  “We want our customers to be able to easily send money to
anyone without having to establish a new account outside their
primary bank,” Mike Kennedy, executive vice president and head
of payments strategy at Wells Fargo, said in the statement.
“All our customers need to know is the e-mail address or mobile
number of a friend or family member and we will take care of the
rest utilizing clearXchange.”  The three banks will run and own the service, with Bank of
America’s John Feldman serving as general manager. Financial
terms weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
