The Philippine peso fell to an
eighth-week low as data showed a widening trade deficit, and
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening deterred risk taking.  The trade shortfall widened to $1.17 billion in March from
$896 million in February, the National Statistics office
reported today. Belgium had the outlook on its debt rating
lowered to negative by  Fitch Ratings  this week, while  Greece ’s
rating was cut three levels on May 20. Overseas investors sold
$106 million more local shares than they bought in the first two
days of this week.  “Risk is on again because of the continuing problems in
Greece,” said Marcelo Ayes, senior vice president at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. in Manila. “Global weakness continues
to persist and growth should be driven by the domestic
economy.”  The peso declined 0.4 percent to 43.575 per dollar as of
the 4 p.m. close of trading in  Manila , according to Tullett
Prebon Plc. It touched 43.585 earlier, the weakest level since
March 29.  The Philippines’ Bureau of Customs, responsible for a fifth
of the nation’s revenue, has a “good chance” of exceeding its
collection target this year, Commissioner Lito Alvarez said in a
briefing today. Revenue this month may be below its 25 billion
peso ($574 million) target, he said.  The yield on the 7 percent January 2016 peso bond fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.35 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter for this story:
