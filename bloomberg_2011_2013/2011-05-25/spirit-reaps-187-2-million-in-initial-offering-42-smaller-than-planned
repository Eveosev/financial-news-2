Spirit Airlines Inc. raised $187.2
million, 42 percent less than it originally sought, after the
U.S. discount carrier cut the price and number of shares in its
initial public offering.  The Miramar, Florida-based airline sold 15.6 million shares
at $12 each, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Spirit
initially planned to raise as much as $320 million, according to
a regulatory filing, before shrinking its offering from 20
million shares and lowering the range to $12 to $13 from a band
of $14 to $16.  Spirit, which flies mostly between  Florida  and the
Caribbean, had said it would use the funds for future plane
purchases and to pay off debt. It is going public as jet fuel
hovers near a three-year high, crimping industry profits and
forcing carriers to raise fares.  The shares will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the
symbol SAVE.  Gulfstream International Group Inc. (GIGIQ)  was the last
U.S. passenger airline to hold an IPO, selling shares in 2007
and filing for bankruptcy last year.  Private equity firm Indigo Partners LLC bought a majority
stake in Spirit in 2006, and also invests in similar low-fare
carriers outside the U.S., including  Mexico â€™s Volaris. Oaktree
Capital Management LP is the second-biggest investor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
