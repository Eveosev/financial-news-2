The  European Central Bank  said it
will lend banks 48.1 billion euros ($68 billion) for three
months.  Thatâ€™s more than lenders need to return to the ECB
tomorrow, when 39.8 billion euros of three-month loans expire.
The ECB said 182 banks asked for the funds, which will be lent
at the average of its benchmark interest rate over the period.
Policy makers earlier this month kept borrowing costs at 1.25
percent after increasing them in April for the first time in
almost three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
