Sugar rose for the second straight
day on signs of shipping delays from  Brazil , the world’s leading
exporter, and Thailand, the second-biggest. Cocoa and coffee
climbed in New York.  Swiss Sugar Brokers, based in Rolle, Switzerland, said
today in a report that Brazil’s “incapacity to catch up with
their crop delay” supported prices. The European Union may
allow additional duty-free imports of 200,000 metric tons of
sugar.  “Backlogs are causing supply concerns, driving the market
up,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures in
Tampa. “We should see an increase for the next few weeks or
so.”  Raw sugar for July delivery gained 0.73 cent, or 3.3
percent, to settle at 22.64 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . The price climbed 1.9 percent
yesterday.  In  London , refined-sugar futures for August delivery
climbed $24.90, or 4 percent, to $648 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for July delivery advanced $78, or 2.7
percent, to $2,962 a ton in New York.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery gained 3.65 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $2.6485 a pound on ICE.  Robusta coffee and cocoa rose in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
