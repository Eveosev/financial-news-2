Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, said it will enhance the software on some
industrial control management systems after the U.S. government
raised concern about possible security breaches.  Siemens has updated its programmable logic controllers, or
PLCs, which are now being tested, and the new product will be
available within a few weeks, the Munich-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today. Siemens’s PLCs, used to help steer
factory automation equipment, had been used without standard IT
security, it said.  “Siemens is in direct contact with its customers on a
regular basis with regards to security gaps identified in its
products,” the company said in a statement.  Security researchers at NSS Labs, a Carlsbad, California-
based security testing facility, had tested Siemens’s product
and found vulnerabilities which would let “knowledgeable
hackers” manipulate the system, the U.S. Department of  Homeland
Security  said in a report dated May 19.  The U.S. department said Siemens had 11 percent of the
North American market for industrial control systems, used in
industries ranging from cement to chemicals as well as food and
beverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
