China ’s yuan advanced to near its
strongest level since 1993 as the currency’s reference rate rose
the most in four months.  The People’s Bank of China set the rate 0.14 percent
stronger at 6.4949 per dollar, the biggest increase since Jan.
14. Policy makers may allow the yuan to move within 1 percent of
the rate, from 0.5 percent now,  Taiwan ’s Economic Daily News
reported yesterday, citing a Chinese central bank official it
didn’t name. The yuan is little changed since May 11, when data
showed consumer prices gained 5.3 percent in April following a
5.4 percent rise in March that was the biggest since July 2008.  “The PBOC isn’t shying away from stronger fixes against
the dollar,” said David Dimmock, director of fixed income and
currencies at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “It’s too early
for them to stop tightening given” concerns about inflation, he
said.  The yuan advanced 0.06 percent to 6.4934 per dollar as of
the close at 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency reached 6.4892 on
April 29, the strongest level since 1993. In Hong Kong’s
offshore market, the yuan was little changed at 6.50 from 6.4990
yesterday.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.05 percent
to 6.3865 per dollar as of 4:43 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting a
1.7 percent premium over the spot rate in Shanghai, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The NDF is more about the reflection of the general risk-
off environment,” Dimmock said. “There are good reasons to be
cautious with the Europe situation.”  Belgium had the outlook on its debt rating lowered to
negative by  Fitch Ratings  this week, which joined  Standard &
Poor’s  in saying that political deadlock complicates efforts to
cut the euro area’s third-highest debt load.  To contact the reporter on this story:
