Soc. Quimica y Minera de Chile SA,
the country’s biggest fertilizer producer, climbed for a fourth
day in Santiago trading after reporting a 46 percent increase in
first-quarter profit.  Soquimich, as the company is known, rose 0.6 percent to
27,949 pesos at 4 p.m. New York time, its highest price in three
weeks.  Net income increased to $111 million from $76.5 million a
year ago, according to a statement posted after the close of
trading yesterday on the securities regulator’s website. That
matched the average estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  “We have observed a return to historical growth rates in
our main markets, and we expect this healthy demand trend to
continue in the following quarters of the year,” Soquimich
Chief Executive Officer Patricio Contesse said in an e-mailed
press release accompanying the results.  Revenue in the quarter rose 24 percent to $480 million as
demand grew in all of the company’s business lines, the company
said in the statement.  “SQM reported good numbers yesterday,” Credit Suisse
Group AG said in a note to clients today. “The stock may react
up, but we consider it fairly valued at 26 times 2011 price-to-
earnings ratio.”  Soquimich plans to invest $300 million this year, deputy
general manager, Patricio de Solminihac, said today at a
conference call with investors. He added that potash prices will
continue to rise in the second half of the year and margins
should remain at current levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
