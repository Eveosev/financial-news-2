Aveva Group Plc (AVV) , a U.K. maker of
engineering software products, said full-year profit rose 3
percent, boosted by sales to oil, gas and power customers in the
Asia-Pacific region.  Net income for the year ended March 31 climbed to 34.5
million pounds ($55.8 million), or 50.6 pence a share, from 33.4
million pounds, or 49.1 pence, a year earlier, the Cambridge,
England-based company said in a statement today. Revenue rose 17
percent to 174 million pounds.  “2010/11 has seen good growth for Aveva with a
particularly strong performance in the emerging markets, mainly
driven by oil, gas and power,” Chairman Nick Prest said in the
statement. “We have seen an improvement in business conditions
in the last quarter of the year and we remain cautiously
optimistic that this will continue into 2011/12.”  The oil and gas industry accounts for about 45 percent of
revenue, Aveva said. Revenue in Asia-Pacific, the region which
is the biggest contributor to growth, rose 31 percent to 66.3
million pounds from the previous year, the company said.  Aveva plans to expand its operations in  China  by opening a
research and development facility in  Shanghai , Chief Executive
Officer Richard Longdon said in a conference call. The company
already has R&D facilities in the U.K.,  Denmark , Sweden, Norway
and  India , the CEO said.  “The Chinese government is very welcoming of Western
companies because of tax breaks,” Longdon said.  Aveva is also looking at acquiring companies and is
particularly interested in the power industry where there “are
significant opportunities,” Longdon said on the call.  The shares fell 31 pence, or 2 percent, to 1,540 pence at
8:35 a.m. in London, giving the company a market value of 1.05
billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
