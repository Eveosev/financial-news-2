The  ash cloud  from Iceland’s
Grimsvotn volcano that grounded flights in Scotland and Northern
Europe has now moved away from the U.K. toward continental
Europe, the U.K.’s  Met Office  said in a statement on its
 website , citing information from the Icelandic Meteorological
Office.  The U.K. is now in an “improving situation” and there
will only be “minimal ash” over the U.K. and Europe through
the weekend, the Met Office said. While still active with “on-
going low-level seismic activity reported,” the volcano is no
longer emitting ash, the Met Office said,  To contact the reporter on this story:
