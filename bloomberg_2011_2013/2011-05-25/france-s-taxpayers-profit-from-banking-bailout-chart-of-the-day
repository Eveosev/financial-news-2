French taxpayers have so far reaped a
2.4 billion-euro ($3.5 billion) gain from bailing out the
country’s banks, while the Irish government has run up the
biggest loss in the European Union.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the cumulative costs and gains
incurred by 10 European countries from 2008 to 2010, according
to data published by Eurostat last month. The bailout cost EU
countries 69.2 billion euros in total, the data show.  Greece , Denmark, Spain and France profited from their
bailout by charging banks fees to insure their bonds and
receiving dividends from the stakes they took in firms they
rescued. By contrast, Ireland,  Germany  and Britain provided
direct capital transfers to cover the losses at banks including
Anglo Irish Bank Corp Ltd.,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and
Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, Eurostat said.  “This mostly reflects the pre-existing shape of the banks
which took on huge risks and were overleveraged, and caused huge
losses that taxpayers and governments took over,” said Paul de Grauwe, an economics professor at the Katholieke Universiteit
Leuven in Belgium.  France earned interest and fees on the capital injections
and guarantees it provided to lenders including BNP Paribas SA,
 Societe Generale (GLE)  SA and  Credit Agricole SA. (ACA)  The government’s
stake in Franco-Belgian bank Dexia SA, which has declined 75
percent since the firm was bailed out in 2008, isn’t included in
Eurostat’s figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
