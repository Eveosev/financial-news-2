Sudan ’s  central bank  said it approved
a request by  Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB)  to open a branch in the
African country.  Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, the  United Arab Emirates ’ second-
biggest Shariah-compliant lender, has more than $400 million in
investments in Sudan, and “hopefully the figure will double
with the presence of a branch,” the Khartoum-based bank said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Sudan’s financial industry is run under Islamic law and all
banks in the country’s north must adhere to it, though
conventional lenders are allowed to operate in Southern Sudan,
which plans to declare independence in July. Sudan has been
categorized by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism since
1993 and has been subject to U.S. economic sanctions since 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
