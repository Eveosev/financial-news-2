Abu Dhabi â€™s Murban oil fell for a
third day against its benchmark, down by more than half from its
peak this month, as declining refining profits crimped demand
for crude.  Murban for July loading dropped 3 cents to a premium of 38
cents a barrel after reaching 81 cents on May 16, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a premium of 86
cents a barrel for June cargoes, the highest in three years.
Qatar Marine fell 16 cents to a premium of 15 cents a barrel to
its benchmark, Bloomberg data showed. It reached 43 cents May 18.  Refiners are balking at paying higher premiums for the
grades as a decline in gasoil margins has limited the amount of
profit they make from upgrading  fuel oil  to higher value
products such as  diesel fuel . The black-white spread, or the
price difference between fuel oil and diesel, has narrowed to
$24.20 a barrel today, a drop of 27 percent since May 2.  Both grades yield between 36 percent and 37 percent fuel
oil after basic processing, according to data from Energy
Intelligence Group. That residue has lost value as the black-
white spread narrows.  Oman oil for immediate loading rose 93 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $107.59 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai for
loading in July increased 0.9 percent to $107.04 and Murban
crude climbed 0.8 percent to $112.11 a barrel.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July narrowed 2
cents to $5.70 a barrel, data from PVM showed. The exchange for
swaps for August decreased 7 cents to $5.54 a barrel.  Oman futures for July delivery fell 5 cents to $107.37 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:49 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,298 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$106.33 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
