Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) ’s Selex Galileo
unit, which makes defense electronics including military radios,
will eliminate about 150 manufacturing, engineering and support
jobs at sites in the U.K. as military budgets shrink.  Job cuts will come at sites in Luton and Basildon,  England 
and Aberporth,  Wales , Selex Galileo said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “Highly skilled, well-paid jobs are being lost at an
alarming rate in the U.K. defense industry because the
government is squeezing” military spending, Ian Waddell,
national officer for aerospace & shipbuilding for the Unite
labor union, said in a separate  statement .  The U.K. government must find further savings in its
military programs beyond cuts announced in a review last
October, Defense Minister Peter Luff said in March. Proposed
reductions to balance the ministry’s budget fall short of what’s
needed for the 12 months beginning in April, Luff said.  “This has been a difficult decision,” Norman Bone, Selex
Galileo’s managing director, said in the statement. The job cuts
were needed to “address some of the difficulties facing our
business and to ensure that we maintain an affordable and
efficient cost base to remain competitive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
