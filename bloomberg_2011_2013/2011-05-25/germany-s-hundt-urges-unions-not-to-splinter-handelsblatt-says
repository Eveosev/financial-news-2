Dieter Hundt, president of  Germany ’s
top employers’ federation BDA, urged the country’s big unions to
fight increasing efforts within their ranks to splinter into
new, smaller trade groups, the  Handelsblatt  newspaper reported.  In an interview published today, Hundt said workplace
conflict is rising as new vocational groups present employers
with multiple tariff claims that may pit worker against worker
for higher pay and better conditions. Production may also suffer
if tariff accords create new work arrangements that clash, the
Dusseldorf-based newspaper quoted Hundt as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
