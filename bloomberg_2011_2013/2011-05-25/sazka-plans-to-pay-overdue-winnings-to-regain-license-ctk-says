Sazka AS, a bankrupt Czech lottery
operator, will pay overdue winnings worth 103.4 million koruna
($6.1 million) tomorrow,  CTK  reported, citing the company.  Sazkaâ€™s license for lottery business was temporarily
suspended for 30 days on May 9 by the  Finance Ministry  after the
state-owned lottery operator failed to pay the winnings from
January.  The ministry also started administrative proceedings with
Sazka because of unpaid overdue fees from lottery and gaming
business worth 66 million koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
