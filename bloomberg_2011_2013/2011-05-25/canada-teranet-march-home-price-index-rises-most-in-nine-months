National Bank Financial. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
forecast the index to rise 0.2 percent, based on the median of

Toronto and  Vancouver , the report said. Prices increased 0.4
percent in Ottawa and 0.3 percent in Halifax, Nova Scotia, while
they fell 0.1 percent in Calgary.  Canadian housing prices gained 4.1 percent on a year-over-
year basis according to the index, up from a 3.8 percent pace in
the previous month. It was the first yearly price acceleration
