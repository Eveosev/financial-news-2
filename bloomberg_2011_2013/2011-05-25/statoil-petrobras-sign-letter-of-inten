Statoil ASA (STL)  and  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4)  signed a letter of intent to expand cooperation in
exploration to cut costs.  The two companies may buy exploration acreage together “in
areas of mutual interest,” Stavanger-based Statoil, Norway’s
biggest oil and gas producer, said in an e-mailed  statement 
today. “This would be acquired through joint participation in
public bid rounds,” according to the statement.  Statoil in April started output at the Peregrino field in
Brazil’s Campos Basin. Output will gradually increase to 100,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day over 12 months, Peter Mellbye,
Statoil’s head of international development and production, said
April 11. Peregrino is estimated to hold as much as 600 million
barrels of recoverable reserves.  Statoil, which operates about 80 percent of  Norway ’s oil
and gas production, is expanding abroad to maintain output and
boost reserves amid dwindling production from aging North Sea
fields. The company is poised to become the second-largest
operator in Brazil, which plans to double oil output in less
than a decade, and is seeking to add to its portfolio.  “For a number of years Statoil has had a technology
agreement with Petrobras,” Statoil Chief Executive Officer
 Helge Lund  said in the statement. “A lot of good work has been
done in both companies through information sharing and a joint
commitment to common technology projects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
