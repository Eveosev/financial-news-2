International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
has closed the gap in market value with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , giving
it the potential to become the second-most valuable technology
company as its bet against personal computers pays off.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how IBM’s market value has
climbed to nearly that of Microsoft, which was worth three times
as much as IBM in 2000. Microsoft had a market capitalization of
$203.7 billion when markets closed yesterday, compared with
IBM’s $203.5 billion, according to Bloomberg data.  Microsoft, whose Windows and Office software are used
primarily on PCs, lost its spot as the most valuable technology
company last year to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , as sales of iPad tablets and
iPhones crimped PC demand. IBM Chief Executive Officer  Sam Palmisano  divested the company’s PC business six years ago,
calling it commoditized, to invest in software and services.  IBM, now the world’s largest computer-services provider,
topped Microsoft’s value in intraday trading last week. It
hasn’t closed with a value above its rival since 1996, according
to Bloomberg data.  IBM gained 2 cents to $168.01 at 9:42 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, while Microsoft gained 9 cents
to $24.24 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The companies had
gained 14 percent and lost 13 percent, respectively, this year
before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
