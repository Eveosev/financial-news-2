Gold rose for a fourth straight
session, the longest rally in three weeks, as  Europe ’s debt
crisis increased investor demand for the precious metal as a
protection of wealth.  Christian Noyer, a member of the  European Central Bank ’s
governing council, yesterday ruled out a restructuring of
Greece’s debt, calling it a “horror story” that would leave
the nation shut out of financing for years. Gold priced in euros
and British pounds climbed to records today as policy makers
disagreed over how to solve Greece’s fiscal woes.  “We are bullish of gold in both U.S.-dollar terms and non-
U.S.-dollar terms,” said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the
editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter. “The
trend here is clearly to the upside as the problems in Europe
prove to be more and more intractable.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $3.50, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $1,527.80 an ounce at 1:52 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The metal has gained 27 percent in the past
year, touching a record $1,577.40 on May 2.  “The trump-card currency of choice is gold, and in all
likelihood, it shall become even more readily embraced, not less
so, in the days and weeks ahead as Europe’s problems worsen,”
Gartman said.  Some European Union officials have supported a so-called
reprofiling of Greece’s debt, whereby its payback period could
be lengthened and interest costs may be reduced. Moody’s
Investors Service is “very likely” to class a reprofiling of
Greek debt as a default, according to Alastair Wilson, the
company’s chief credit officer for Europe, the Middle East and
Africa.  Currency Concern  Gold has gained even as the dollar climbed against the
euro.  “What is noteworthy is the divergence between gold and the
greenback,” said Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago . “People are looking for perceived safety
because nobody knows what really will happen to the euro, and
there are doubts about the future of the dollar as a
powerhouse.”  Silver futures for July delivery rose $1.514, or 4.2
percent, to $37.642 an ounce on the Comex.  Palladium futures for September delivery advanced $12.10,
or 1.6 percent, to $749.20 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for July delivery gained $17.30, or 1
percent, to $1,779.80 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
