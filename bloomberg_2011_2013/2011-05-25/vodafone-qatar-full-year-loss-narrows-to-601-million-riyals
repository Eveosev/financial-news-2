Vodafone Qatar, a venture between
Vodafone Group LLC and state-controlled  Qatar Foundation , said
its full-year loss narrowed as revenue almost tripled.  The loss for the fiscal year to March 31 narrowed to 601
million riyals ($165 million) from 673.4 million riyals a year
earlier, the company said in a statement on its website today.
Revenue rose to 934.9 million riyals from 361.5 million riyals.  Vodafone Qatar broke a monopoly held by Qatar Telecom QSC,
the Gulf Arab country’s largest company by revenue, when it
began operations in 2009.  “We are excited about the year ahead, in which we plan to
increase our network by 25 percent,” Acting Chief Executive
Officer John Tombleson said in an e-mailed statement today.  Vodafone Qatar’s customer base grew 63 percent during the
fiscal year and reached 756,767 subscriptions as of March 31, or
about 45 percent of the population, according to the release.
The company’s loss, measured before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization, narrowed to 27.1 million riyals for the year.  Vodafone Qatar (VFQS) ’s shares increased 1.4 percent to 7.95
riyals today, trimming the drop for the year to 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
