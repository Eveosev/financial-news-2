EFG-Hermes Holding SAE,  Egypt ’s
biggest publicly traded investment bank, gained the most in
almost two years after the country’s markets regulator approved
a capital increase plan to help it expand in commercial banking.  The shares of the Cairo-based firm gained 7.3 percent, the
most since May 2009, to 21.24 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m.
close in Cairo. The advance pared the share-price drop to 34
percent since the start of a popular uprising that toppled the
North African country’s 30-year-old regime.  EFG-Hermes today said the Egyptian Financial Supervisory
Authority approved the plan to raise its capital to 2.1 billion
Egyptian pounds ($353 million) from 1.9 billion pounds by
issuing one free share for every 10 held.  “They want to become less reliant on  investment banking ,
so from strategic point of view it makes sense, and it will help
them diversify their income sources,” said Dubai-based Jaap
Meijer, head of banks research team at AlembicHC. “But we have
yet to see whether it will add to  shareholder value .”  The company will use the funds to finance the acquisition
of commercial banking licenses in the region, it said in an e-
mailed statement today. In August, EFG-Hermes bought a 65
percent stake in Credit Libanaise SAE for $542 million to expand
its operations in commercial banking with an option to buy 25
percent over the following two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
