“ American Idol ” finalist Lauren
Alaina recovered from a voice problem that threatened to knock
her out of the last round of the Fox singing contest.  Alaina, 16, sang all three songs last night after receiving
medical attention and telling the audience on News Corp.’s Fox
she was ready to compete. A doctor came onstage at the Nokia
Theatre in  Los Angeles  to say she could sing after damaging her
vocal chords in rehearsals.  The ailment threatened to break up the all-country finale
between Alaina, from Rossville, Georgia, and 17-year-old Scotty
McCreery of Garner,  North Carolina . Haley Reinhart, a 20-year-
old pop singer who was eliminated last week, stood by as a
possible replacement for Alaina on TV’s most-watched show.  The winner of the season-long contest will be announced
tonight. Viewers could vote by text, phone or online after the
performance.  News Corp. (NWSA) , controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Rupert Murdoch, fell 4 cents to $17.05 yesterday in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Class A shares of the New York-
based media company have climbed 17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
