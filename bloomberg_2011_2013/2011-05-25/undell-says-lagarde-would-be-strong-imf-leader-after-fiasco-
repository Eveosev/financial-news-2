French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde , who today declared her candidacy to lead the
International Monetary Fund, is “an international superstar,”
said Nobel Prize-winning economist  Robert Mundell .  “She’s made a tremendous impression,” Mundell, a member
of the faculty at Columbia University and an adviser to the IMF,
said today on the Bloomberg Radio program, the “Hays
Advantage” with Kathleen Hays.  “She’s got a very strong background and would be a very
good leader,” Mundell said. “What the IMF needs right now, in
backing up from the fiasco recently, is someone who can lead
strongly.”  She “knows the economics and politics of it,” he said.  Lagarde would become the first woman to lead the
Washington-based lender to world governments since its founding
in 1945. She would succeed countryman  Dominique Strauss-Kahn ,
who resigned after being charged in a sexual assault in New
York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
