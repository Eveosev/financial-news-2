Nampak Ltd. (NPK)  said increased profit
from the rest of  Africa  will contribute to an overall
improvement in group performance for the full-year, albeit at a
lower rate than achieved in the first six months.  “Demand from South African consumers has been moderate and
no significant improvement is expected in the next six months,”
the company said in a statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
