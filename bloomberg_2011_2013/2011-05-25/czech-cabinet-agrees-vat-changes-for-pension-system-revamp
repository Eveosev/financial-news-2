The Czech Cabinet approved a draft
law changing the value-added tax aimed at financing a planned
overhaul of the pension system, Prime Minister Petr Necas said.  Under the proposed bill, which must be approved by
parliament, the lower VAT bracket will rise to 14 percent from
10 percent next year, while the upper bracket will stay at 20
percent, in line with an agreement among the three ruling-
coalition parties. The VAT rate will be unified at 17.5 percent
from 2013, Necas told reporter in  Prague  today.  The government will use proceeds from the VAT to cover the
gap in state finances that will emerge after workers start
diverting part of their compulsory pension payments to personal
accounts in 2013.  The  Czech Republic  is the last of the four largest post-
communist economies in the European Union to boost private
savings for retirement as the government expects an ageing
population to reduce the number of workers paying for pensions
of the retired. The Cabinet wants to avoid the difficulties
suffered by Hungary and  Poland , where pension changes widened
budget gaps, forcing a reversal of their overhauls.  The  Finance Ministry  estimated the VAT changes may boost
inflation by 1.2 percentage points next year. The central bank
forecast the impact at 1.1 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
