(Corrects second paragraph of story originally published
May 25 to show figure relates to valuation.)  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) ’s Zambian unit,
Konkola Copper Mines, said it hasn’t reached a decision on next
steps toward an initial public offering.  The Sunday Times reported May 22 that the unit may be
valued at 4.5 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) in an IPO. The
London-based newspaper, which didn’t say where it got the
information, said the sale may happen as soon as next month.  “The company has not reached a decision on its next steps
with regards to the listing process,” Konkola, based in
Chingola, northern Zambia, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Vedanta said last November it aimed to carry out an IPO of
Konkola in 2011. Konkola, which produced about 217,000 metric
tons of copper in 2010, targets annual output of 400,000 tons
once its Konkola Deep Mine Project comes on stream.  Zambia ,  Africa ’s top copper producer, is seeking to more
than double production to about 2 million tons a year by 2015,
Finance and National Planning Minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane 
said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
