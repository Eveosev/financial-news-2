Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , India’s largest
wind-turbine maker, signed a contract to supply and construct 76
 wind turbines  in  South Africa .  African Clean Energy Developments Pty. has the option to
buy an additional 124 turbines for its Cookhouse wind energy
project, according to a Suzlon statement sent to the Bombay
Stock Exchange today. It didn’t provide a value of the contract.  Suzlon will provide engineering, procurement and
construction services for the project and supply its S88 2-
megawatt turbines, it said.  Installation may begin in late 2011 or early 2012, it
added. The contract is contingent upon the Cookhouse project
securing a power purchase agreement and successfully raising
finance, it said.  African Clean Energy Developments is a joint venture
between AFPOC Ltd. and African Infrastructure Investment
Managers owned by Macquarie Capital and Old Mutual Investment
Group, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
