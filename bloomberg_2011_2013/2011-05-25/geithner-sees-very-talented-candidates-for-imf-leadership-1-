U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said both French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  and
Mexican central bank Governor Agustin Carstens are “very
talented” candidates to head the  International Monetary Fund .  Speaking today at an event in Washington, he said that the
U.S., the largest shareholder at the institution, will play a
“significant” role in the choice of a successor to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned after his arrest on charges of
attempted rape and sexual assault.  Lagarde today declared her candidacy, saying she should be
judged on the basis of experience rather than nationality. The
IMF executive directors representing Brazil, Russia, India,
China and  South Africa  united yesterday to protest publicly the
presumption that the fund’s next chief again be European. The
IMF has been led by Europeans since it was set up after World
War II.  Lagarde “is an exceptionally capable person, an excellent
mix of financial economic knowledge, talent and the kind of
political skill you need to navigate this context,” Geithner
said. Carstens “has that as well.”  The U.S. voting share at the IMF is close to 17 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
