Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest oil company, discussed possible projects to explore for
oil and gas in Arctic and  Black Sea  waters with Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin’s deputy in charge of energy.  Shell Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  and Igor Sechin,
who is also a board director at state-controlled OAO Rosneft,
talked about possible projects outside Russia as well, the
government said in a  statement . Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov
attended the meeting.  The talks focused on “potential exploration co-operation
with Rosneft in the Arctic, broader strategic cooperation and
technology development for the Arctic and other areas as well as
opportunities for Rosneft to join Shell in developments outside
Russia,” Kirsten Smart, a London-based spokeswoman at Shell,
said in an e-mail. “These discussions excluded any proposals to
use Shell’s shares.”  Shell, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are potential
candidates should Rosneft look for a new partner to explore the
Arctic Ocean after its plan with  BP Plc (BP/)  to set up a joint
venture and swap shares collapsed, said a person with knowledge
of the company’s plans. The Hague-based Shell and Rosneft in
2007 signed a “strategic agreement” and would still need to
agree on joint projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
