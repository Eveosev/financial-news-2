South African  Reserve Bank  Deputy
Governor Lesetja Kganyago, who took office last week, will
oversee the departments of banking supervision, financial
stability and exchange control regulation.  Kganyago, who was previously director-general of the
National Treasury, will also manage the risk and compliance
division at the central bank, he said in an interview in
 Pretoria  yesterday.  The Reserve Bank’s mandate was expanded last year to
include a focus on financial stability, with the Monetary Policy
Committee extending its regular meetings by half a day to two-
and-a-half days to discuss banking. The MPC was enlarged to
eight members with the inclusion of Kganyago and Rashad Cassim,
who joined the bank in March from Statistics South Africa to
head up the research department.  Kganyago is one of three deputy governors reporting to
Governor  Gill Marcus .  The two new MPC members “bring a great deal of knowledge,
insight, analysis and voice to the MPC and we look forward to
their contribution,” Marcus said at a public meeting at the
central bank’s head office in Pretoria yesterday. “They will
strengthen the team and be an enhancement on what we do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
