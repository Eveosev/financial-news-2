Georgia’s central bank  left its
benchmark refinancing rate unchanged at 8 percent for a third
month after inflation slowed in April, the Tbilisi-based bank
said on its website today.  Higher food and energy costs boosted inflation above the
central bank’s 6 percent target for the last 10 months. Consumer
prices grew an annual 13.5 percent in April, sparking anti-
government protests in the capital this week. The government
spent 30 million lari ($18 million) in March on food vouchers to
lessen the impact of rising prices for consumers and gave out
coupons for free electricity.  “Tackling inflation only with monetary-policy changes is
not enough,” Nodar Khaduri, an economics at the Tbilisi State
University, said before the rate announcement. “Inflation
already exceeded its limits, the  budget deficit  needs to be
reduced, and the  exchange rate  is quite unstable.”  The  International Monetary Fund  said last month that
Georgia may have to raise interest rates to curb inflation
fuelled by rising prices on imported goods and products should
“price shocks” be transmitted in to general inflation.  The central bank last raised the rate by a half-point to
7.5 percent on February 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
