Japanese stocks fell, led by
electronics makers after  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) , the world’s
largest producer of chip-making equipment, forecast profit that
missed analysts’ estimates.  Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co., a chip-equipment
manufacturer, retreated 2.8 percent. Mitsubishi Estate Co., the
country’s No. 1 developer by value, dropped 0.5 percent after
Nomura Holdings Inc. reported demand for offices may decline.
 Sony Corp. (6758)  declined 1.5 percent after the electronics maker,
already reeling from the second-largest online data breach in
U.S. history, said hackers attacked websites affiliated with the
company in Canada and  Thailand .  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.6 percent to 9,422.88
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in  Tokyo . The broader Topix index
slipped 0.2 percent to 817.74, with about seven stocks declining
for every three that advanced.  “There’s a vague sense of unease and uncertainty about the
overseas economy, so it’s difficult for people to continue to
buy stocks,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in
Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which oversees about $104
billion.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.5
percent today. In  New York , the index fell 0.1 percent to
1,316.28 yesterday as a drop in stocks most-tied to economic
growth offset a government report showing that sales of new
homes rose to the highest level this year.  Japan  Trade Deficit  Japan posted its first trade deficit for the month of April
in 31 years as exports slumped in the aftermath of the March 11
earthquake and a surge in commodity prices pushed up import
costs, a government report showed today.  The Topix has lost 12 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, crippling four of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
nuclear reactors and disrupting supply chains at companies from
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  to chipmaker Renesas Electric Corp. Companies
in the Topix traded at 0.93 times estimated book value, compared
with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Semiconductor-related firms declined after  Santa Clara ,
California-based Applied Materials, a maker of semiconductor
wafer fabrication equipment, forecast profit that missed
analysts’ estimates.  Dainippon Screen Manufacturing fell 2.8 percent to 654 yen.
 Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035) , Japan’s biggest manufacturer of chip-making
equipment, declined 2.1 percent to 4,410 yen.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) ,
the world’s third-largest maker of computer memory, dropped 3.8
percent to 1,048 yen.  ‘Investors Wary’  Applied Materials said yesterday profit excluding certain
costs in the current period will be 31 cents to 37 cents a share,
and sales will drop by between 3 percent and 10 percent from the
prior quarter. That would indicate sales of about $2.57 billion
to $2.77 billion. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey on average
projected profit of 38 cents and revenue of $2.83 billion.  After Applied Materials released its forecast, “people are
wary of possible drop in the U.S. stocks tonight,” said Takashi Ushio, head of investment at Marusan Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Property developers dropped after Nomura Holdings said
demand for commercial offices will likely continue to fall and
office vacancy rates and office rents will worsen in 2011 and
2012. Mitsubishi Estate lost 0.5 percent to 1,392 yen. Sumitomo
Realty & Development Co., the No. 3, fell 1.3 percent to 1,663
yen.  Nomura Real Estate Holdings Inc. (3231)  sank 1.4 percent to 1,235
yen.  Sony lost 1.5 percent to 2,236 yen. Sony Ericsson Mobile
Communications AB’s Canadian unit had its website hacked and the
personal information of 2,000 customers was stolen, Sony
spokesman Atsuo Omagari said. The company is also investigating
possible breaches at websites in Japan and  Indonesia , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
