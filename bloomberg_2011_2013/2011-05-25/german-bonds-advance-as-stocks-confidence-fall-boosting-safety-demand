German, French and Dutch government
bonds rose after a report showed  consumer confidence  will fall
next month as the region’s sovereign-debt crisis worsens.  The gains drove the yield on the 10-year German bund to
within three basis points of a four-month low, while the two-
year yield reached the lowest level in two months. The  MSCI
World (MXWO)  Index of equities fell as much as 0.4 percent, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.3 percent. German
consumer confidence will decline for a third consecutive month
in June, a report by GfK AG showed today.  Germany  sold 4.2
billion euros ($5.9 billion) of 10-year debt.  “The backdrop remains supportive, with weakness in
equities, although bunds may struggle to sustain these low
levels of yields in the medium term,” said Steven Mansell, an
interest-rates strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London. “For
choice, the liquid AAA markets in  Europe  are the place to be,
and that’s the supportive backdrop for today’s supply.”  The 10-year bund yield declined two basis points to 3.05
percent as of 4:45 p.m. in London. It reached 3.002 percent on
May 23, the least since Jan. 14. The 3.25 percent security due
July 2021 rose 0.19, or 1.9 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
101.73. The yield on two-year notes dropped five basis points to
1.66 percent. It reached 1.63 percent earlier, the least since
March 18.  The yield on the French 10-year bond declined four basis
points to 3.41 percent, with similar-maturity Dutch yields also
four basis points lower, at 3.33 percent. The euro was little
changed at $1.4093.  ECB Rate Bets  GfK, a Nuremburg-based market research company, forecast
that its consumer sentiment index will fall to 5.5 next month
from 5.7 in May. Economists predicted a decline to 5.6,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Euribor futures rose, pushing the implied yield on the
March 2012 contract down seven basis points to 2 percent, as
investors reduced bets that the ECB will lift interest rates.  Policy makers kept their benchmark interest rate unchanged
at 1.25 percent on May 5, after lifting it from a record low 1
percent in April, the first increase in almost three years as it
sought to curb accelerating consumer-price growth, and ECB
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled he may wait until after
June before raising borrowing costs further. Inflation in the
euro area accelerated to 2.8 percent in the year to April, the
fastest pace in 2 1/2 years.  No ‘Sea Change’  “The ECB will still be raising rates in July on inflation
concerns, so there’s not going to be a big sea change in  market
sentiment ,” Citigroup’s Mansell said.  Greek bonds were mixed after European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  told French daily
newspaper  Les Echos  in an interview that Greek debt maturities
could be extended on a voluntary basis. Restructuring the debt
is excluded, Rehn told the newspaper, while so-called
reprofiling could only come after  Greece  has started its program
of privatizations, he added.  Yields on 10-year Greek debt dropped two basis points to
16.74 percent, while two-year note yields were 22 basis points
higher at 25.95 percent.  Greece’s government endorsed a plan on May 23 to sell
stakes in state-owned companies and cut more than 6 billion
euros in spending as it seeks to win additional aid from the EU
and International Monetary Fund. The European Union plans to
sell 4.75 billion euros of five-year bonds, according to a
banker involved in the transaction.  Credit-Default Swaps  The cost of insuring Portuguese government debt soared to a
record on concern there will be no outright winner declared
after elections next month, complicating the country’s efforts
to cut its  budget deficit .  Credit-default swaps on  Portugal  jumped 16 basis points to
682, according to CMA in  London . Swaps on Greece dropped 36
basis points from an all-time high to 1,438.  Portuguese 10-year bonds rose for the first day in four,
pushing the yield down three basis points to 9.73 percent. It
reached a euro-era record 9.85 percent yesterday. The nation’s
two-year note yield added 15 basis points to 11.55 percent.  Spanish 10-year yields dropped 12 basis points to 5.35
percent, while 10-year Irish yields jumped seven basis points to
10.99 percent, a euro-era record.  Investors bid for 1.70 times the amount of 10-year bunds on
offer today, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of
1.43 at an auction on April 27. The bonds were sold at an
average yield of 3.04 percent, versus 3.28 percent previously.  Italy is scheduled to sell 8 billion euros of 183-day
Treasury bills and 2 billion euros of zero coupon notes due in
2013 tomorrow.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 0.4
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Treasuries have returned 2.3 percent. Greek bonds lost 14
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
