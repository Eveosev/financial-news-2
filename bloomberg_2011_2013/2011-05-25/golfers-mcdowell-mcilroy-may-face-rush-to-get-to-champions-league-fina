Manchester United  fans Graeme McDowell and Rory McIlroy may have a problem if they’re among
the leaders at the European Tour’s BMW PGA Championship this
weekend.  The two Northern Irishmen have tickets to watch United play
Barcelona in the May 28 Champions League soccer final at
London’s Wembley Stadium. With the third round at Wentworth Golf
Club, southwest of London, scheduled to end about 6 p.m. they
may have to race the clock to get to northwest London for the
7:45 p.m. kickoff if they’re in the final groups teeing off.  “I’m hoping I’ll make it,” U.S. Open champion McDowell,
fifth in the Official World Golf Ranking, said at a press
conference today at Wentworth. “If I’m last off, that would be
a good problem to have. But obviously I’m very excited about the
game.”  The game has created a lot of “buzz” among the golfers
this week and tickets have been a hot topic, according to
McDowell.  “It’s proven to be difficult but thankfully I have a super
agent to get me these things,” he said. “I’m taking my dad and
brother and I have a few friends going, so it should be a great
night.”  McIlroy expects Barcelona to make things tough for United
in a rematch of the 2009 final, which was won by the Spanish
champion 2-0.  “Barcelona can turn it on at any stage they want,” the
sixth-ranked McIlroy told reporters. “If United can keep it
close for the first hour, maybe catch them on the break or
something, I think that’s the only way. It will be tough, but
I’m looking forward to it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
