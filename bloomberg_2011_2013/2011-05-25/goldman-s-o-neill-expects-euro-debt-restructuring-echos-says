Jim O’Neill , chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management, said restructuring Greek, Irish and
Portuguese debt would be ”manageable,” according to an
interview with French daily newspaper  Les Echos .  Restructuring is needed for Greek debt, is probably
required for Irish debt and may even be necessary in  Portugal ,
O’Neill said in the interview.  Delaying the restructuring would increase the risk of a
contagion that could affect  Spain  and even  Italy , O’Neill told
Les Echos.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
