Israel Corp. slid to the lowest level
in more than seven months after the U.S. imposed sanctions
against another business owned by the Ofer family, the holding
company’s controlling shareholder.  The shares slumped 2.3 percent to 3,687 shekels at 12:46
p.m. in  Tel Aviv , the lowest level since Oct. 12.  Ofer Brothers Group was targeted under the  Iran  Sanctions
Act for doing business with Iran’s energy industry in ways that
might bolster the country’s “illicit” nuclear activities, the
State Department said yesterday.  An e-mailed statement from the Ofer Brothers Group
spokesman’s office yesterday said, “We have never sold ships to
Iran.” The statement added that authorized Israeli officials
would be able to confirm the denial without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
