Vocento SA (VOC)  shareholders may force
Chairman Diego del Alcazar and Chief Executive Officer Jose Manuel Vargas to quit shortly because of board disapproval of
their management,  El Confidencial  reported, citing unidentified
people at the company.  Shareholders who would favor ousting del Alcazar include
Soledad ‘Petisa’ Luca de Tena, Victor Urrutia and Jose
Bergareche, the financial news website reported.  Among other reasons, Vocento’s board was disappointed that
Jose Luis Sainz, considered the number two executive at the
company, was hired by rival  Promotora de Informaciones SA. (PRS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
