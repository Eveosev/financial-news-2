Bank of East Asia Ltd. (23) , the third-
largest Hong Kong-based lender by market value, raised its
home loan charges yesterday after the city’s top two mortgage
lenders rates earlier this month.  Bank of East Asia lifted its mortgage rate linked to
 Hong Kong ’s interbank offered rate, or Hibor, to between
Hibor plus 1.75 percentage point and 2 percentage points,
according to an e-mailed reply to queries from Bloomberg News
today. The rate, effective yesterday, was increased from
Hibor plus 1.5 percentage point.  Banks are facing “upward” pressure on lending and
deposit rates as credit demand soaks up cash from the
financial system,  Hong Kong Monetary Authority ’s Chief
Executive Norman Chan said last week. The city’s  two largest 
home loan providers,  HSBC Holdings Plc (5)  and BOC Hong Kong
(Holdings) Ltd., raised mortgage rates in mid-May after the
central bank in April warned of the risk of a “credit-fueled
property bubble”.  Bank of East Asia climbed 1 percent to HK$32 at the
midday break in Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
