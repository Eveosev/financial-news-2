An index of U.K. consumer-services
companies such as hotels and restaurants fell to the lowest
since November 2009 as selling prices and costs increased, the
 Confederation of British Industry  said.  The gauge dropped to minus 23 in the three months through
May from minus 11 in the quarter through February, the U.K.’s
biggest business lobby said today in a statement in  London . A
measure of volumes at business services such as accountancy and
law slipped to 5 from 8.  U.K. consumer spending fell the most in almost two years in
the first quarter as inflation accelerated to more than double
the  Bank of England ’s 2 percent target. The CBI’s index of
selling prices at consumer-services companies rose to 18, and a
measure of costs per employee increased to 43 from 23, the most
since August 2008.  “We are seeing that rising prices and squeezed incomes are
holding back household spending,” CBI Chief Economic Adviser
Ian McCafferty said in the statement. However business services
gauges demonstrate “sure-fire signs that business spending is
picking up, which will help drive the recovery.”  A measure of hiring at business-service companies rose to
12, the highest since May 2008, from minus 1. A gauge of
expected employment for the coming quarter rose to 30 from 9.  The CBI’s survey was conducted from April 27 to May 18 and
covered 175 companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
