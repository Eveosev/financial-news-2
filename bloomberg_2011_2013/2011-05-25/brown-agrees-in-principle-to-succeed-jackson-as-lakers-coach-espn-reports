Former Cleveland Cavaliers coach  Mike Brown  has agreed in principle to join the Los Angeles Lakers and
succeed  Phil Jackson ,  ESPN reported .  Brown, 41, agreed to a four-year contract with the Lakers
worth $18.25 million, ESPN said, citing unidentified National
Basketball Association sources. Brown was fired by the Cavaliers
on May 24, 2010, and this season worked for ESPN as an NBA
analyst.  Brown had a 272-138 record in five seasons as coach of a
Cavaliers team built around LeBron James. He guided Cleveland to
the 2007 NBA finals and won the NBA’s Coach of the Year award
after the 2008-09 season.  Brown would be the Lakers’ 22nd coach. The franchise ranks
second in NBA history to  Boston  with 16 championships and has
missed the playoffs five times in 63 years. In Jackson’s 11
seasons, the Lakers had a 610-292 record and never missed the
postseason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
