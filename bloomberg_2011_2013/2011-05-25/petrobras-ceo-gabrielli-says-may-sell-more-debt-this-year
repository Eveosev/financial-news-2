Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ’s Chief
Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli said the company may
sell more debt this year.  Petrobras, as  Brazil ’s state-controlled oil producer is
known, is considering its financing options as it reviews 680
investment projects, Gabrielli said in an interview at a
conference outside Oslo today. The Rio de Janeiro-based company
sold $6 billion of dollar-denominated bonds in January.  “Petrobras is always looking for opportunities -- if we
have the opportunity we will do it,” Gabrielli said.  Petrobras is currently revising its five-year, $224 billion
investment plan, which is updated annually. Chief Financial
Officer Almir Barbassa said last week that the company is
considering cutting the spending plan as one of its options.  To contact the reporter on this story:
