U.K.  Europe  Minister David Lidington
will urge the U.K. financial industry to promote itself
throughout Europe as playing an essential role in the region,
the Financial Times reported, citing a speech he is to make in
 London  today. Lidington will also tell the City of London
professionals that the government does not plan to try to block
all new European Union financial regulations, adding that the
“approach should be to seek the best regulation, not the least
regulation,” the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
