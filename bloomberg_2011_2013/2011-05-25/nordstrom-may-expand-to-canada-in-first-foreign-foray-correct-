(Corrects wording to “on our game” in third paragraph in
May 24 story.)  Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) , the U.S. department
store chain with 116 namesake locations, is looking to expand
into  Canada  in its first international foray.  The Seattle-based retailer is studying opening its full-
sized stores in Canada first, rather than its outlets, said
Colin Johnson, a spokesman.  “There is a lot of strong retail presence in Canada, and
if we are fortunate enough to find a location and move forward
with a store, we’re really going to have to be on our game,”
Johnson said in an interview today.  Nordstrom has said it sees opening a maximum additional 14
department stores in the U.S. It also has been seeking to
generate growth through its Rack outlet chain and e-commerce.  Nordstrom fell 12 cents to $45.50 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading today. The shares have risen 7.4
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
