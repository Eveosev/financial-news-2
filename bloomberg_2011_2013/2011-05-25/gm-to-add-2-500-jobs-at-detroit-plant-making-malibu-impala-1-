General Motors Co. (GM)  will invest $69
million and add 2,500 jobs to start making two new models at the
Detroit plant that builds the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid as
the automaker boosts U.S. production.  Two shifts will be added at the Detroit-Hamtramck factory
to produce the Chevrolet Impala and Malibu sedans next year,
Detroit-based GM said today in a statement. The investments are
part of plans GM announced earlier this month to spend $2
billion and add or preserve 4,000 jobs at eight U.S. plants.  Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson is pushing to speed the
development of new models after the company’s 2009 bankruptcy
forced cuts in engineering and design, resulting in a dearth of
new vehicles. GM told suppliers that it would start building the
new Malibu in January 2012 instead of April that year.  The Malibu is currently built at GM’s Fairfax Assembly
plant in  Kansas City ,  Kansas , and production of the car will
continue there, GM said today. The Impala is built at GM’s
factory in Oshawa, Ontario.  GM last week said Chevrolet Volt production at the Detroit-
Hamtramck plant would increase 33 percent from earlier plans and
that the factory would shut down for four weeks starting in June
to prepare for the increased output. Akerson has told executives
he wants GM to boost Volt production to as many as 120,000 units
in 2012, two people familiar with the matter said in January.  About 16,000 Volts will be built this year and 60,000 in
2012, GM said last week. The automaker previously targeted
output of 15,000 this year and 45,000 in 2012.  Joe Ashton, the United Auto Workers union’s vice president
for its GM department, reiterated today that he expects GM to
recall all workers on layoff by September. Ashton made a similar
comment in March at the UAW’s bargaining convention, where it
laid out plans for negotiating new contracts with U.S.
automakers that expire later this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
