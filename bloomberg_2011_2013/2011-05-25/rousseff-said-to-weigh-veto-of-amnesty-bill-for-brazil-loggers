     May 25 (Bloomberg) -- Brazil ’s President Dilma Rousseff may
veto a bill forgiving settlers for illegally clearing parts of
the Amazon rainforest and other protected areas, a government
official said.  Rousseff was displeased with the version of Brazil’s new
forestry code approved last night by the lower house and will
work to modify the bill before it is voted on in the Senate,
said the official, who declined to be named because he is not
authorized to speak publicly about the issue.  The president also doesn’t want to share with state
governments enforcement of the new environmental rules, which
require landowners to preserve or replant vegetation already
eliminated, said the official.  If senators amend the bill, it will return to the lower
house before being sent to Rousseff for her signature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
