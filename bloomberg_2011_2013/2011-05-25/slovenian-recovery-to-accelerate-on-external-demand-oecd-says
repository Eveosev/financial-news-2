Slovenia’s economic recovery will
accelerate this year and next, driven by external demand and
strengthening domestic consumption, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said.  The economy will probably expand 1.8 percent this year,
compared with a 1.2 percent growth rate in 2010, the Paris-based
organization said in its Economic Outlook published today.
Economic growth may accelerate to 2.6 percent in 2012, it said.  Inflation will probably accelerate to an annual rate of 2.5
percent this year on rising global prices before slowing to 2.2
percent in 2012, it said.  The  budget deficit  is likely to remain unchanged at 5.6
percent of gross domestic product this year before narrowing to
a 4.1 percent gap in 2012, according to the report. The OECD
also warned that “long-term fiscal sustainability will be
undermined and the macroeconomic outlook could deteriorate
considerably” if planned pension changes are rejected in a
referendum in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
