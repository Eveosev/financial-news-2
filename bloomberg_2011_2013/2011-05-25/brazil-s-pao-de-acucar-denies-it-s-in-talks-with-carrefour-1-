Pao de Acucar, Brazil’s largest retailer, denied press reports
that it’s in talks with  Carrefour SA (CA)  to merge their businesses
in the Latin American country.  Carrefour, the world’s second-largest retailer, has
mandated Lazard Ltd. to study a merger between its Brazilian
unit and Pao de Acucar, Journal du Dimanche reported May 23,
without saying where it got the information. The Diniz family,
owners of Pao de Acucar, could take a stake in Boulogne-
Billancourt, France-based Carrefour as part of the operation,
the French newspaper said.  The merger could include their food-retail businesses,
drugstores and fuel stations, creating a company with gross
annual revenue of 53.9 billion reais ($33 billion), Brazil’s
Valor Economico reported yesterday, without citing anyone. Pao
de Acucar hired Estater Gestao de Financas to advise on the
deal, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper reported. Pao de Acucar
denied in a regulatory filing today that it had hired advisers.  A spokeswoman for Carrefour declined to comment on Pao’s de
Acucar’s statement.  Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) , which says it has 33.7
percent of Pao de Acucar and joint control with the Diniz
family, said yesterday it hadn’t been informed of any
negotiations and hadn’t given its consent. A spokesman for
Casino declined to comment today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
