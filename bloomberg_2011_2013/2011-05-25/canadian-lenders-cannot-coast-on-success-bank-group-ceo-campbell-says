Canadian banks, ranked the world’s
soundest, “cannot coast” on their success amid global
regulatory reform, said the new head of the  Canadian Bankers
Association .  “Internationally, key questions remain about what the
combined impact of the entire regulatory package will be, and
whether and how it will be applied uniformly across the globe,”
Chief Executive Officer Terry Campbell said in the text of his
speech for a luncheon sponsored by the Toronto Board Of Trade.
“We must remain vigilant here.”  Canada’s banks have been ranked the world’s soundest for
three straight years by the  World Economic Forum , while five
Canadian banks ranked among the world’s 20 strongest lenders in
a report by Bloomberg Markets Magazine.  “We cannot coast,” said Campbell, a former vice president
of policy with the bank group.  Campbell became CEO in March, replacing Nancy Hughes Anthony. The Canadian Bankers Association works on behalf of 52
domestic and foreign banks operating in  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
