Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , the biggest
personal-computer maker, sold $5 billion of debt in its largest
bond offering on record, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The offering included $1.75 billion of two-year floating-
rate notes that pay 28 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate and $500 million of three-year
floating-rate debt that pays a 40 basis-point spread, Bloomberg
data show.  Hewlett-Packard also sold $500 million of 1.55 percent,
three-year notes that yield 68 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries; $1 billion of 2.65 percent, five-year debt
that pays a 90 basis-point spread; and $1.25 billion of 4.3
percent, 10-year bonds that pay 120 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Three-month Libor,
a lending benchmark, was set today at 0.25 percent.  Hewlett-Packard has $1.75 billion of bonds coming due on
May 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds may
also be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment
of short-term IOUs, it said today in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The  Palo Alto , California-
based company had $680 million of commercial paper outstanding
as of Jan. 31, it said in a March 11 regulatory filing.  Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc managed the sale, Bloomberg data show.
Moody’s Investors Service ranks Hewlett-Packard A2 and Standard
& Poor’s grades it an equivalent A.  Hewlett-Packard last sold debt on Nov. 29, when it issued
$2 billion of five- and 10-year notes, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
