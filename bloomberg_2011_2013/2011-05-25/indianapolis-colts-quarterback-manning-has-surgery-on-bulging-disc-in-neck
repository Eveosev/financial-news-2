Peyton Manning  had surgery in Chicago
this week to repair a bulging disc in his neck, Indianapolis
Colts owner Jim Irsay said.  The four-time National Football League Most Valuable Player
will recover fully within six or eight weeks, Irsay told
reporters at an owners’ meeting in Indianapolis.  “He’s doing well,” Irsay said. “In terms of other
procedures he’s had, I’d say this one was probably less
invasive.”  Manning had neck surgery last year to repair a pinched
nerve. The Colts’ quarterback has started 227 consecutive games
including the postseason, the NFL’s second-longest streak behind
 Brett Favre .  “It’s a minor one -- unless it’s on you or your franchise
quarterback,” Irsay said. “But really, it went well and I
think it’s one that you can bounce back from pretty quickly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
