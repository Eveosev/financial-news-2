Kookmin Bank and six other South
Korean banks will form a fund to buy as much as 2.5 trillion won
($2.3 billion) in soured real-estate loans after lenders’ total
bad-debt ratio for property financing jumped to a record.  Kookmin Bank, the nation’s largest, and Woori Bank will
join the so-called “project finance normalization bank,”
spokesmen for the companies said today via telephone in Seoul.
 Shinhan Bank , Hana Bank,  Industrial Bank of Korea (024110) , National
Agricultural Cooperative Federation and  Korea  Development Bank
will also join the fund, their spokesmen said.  The fund, to be formed next month, will start with 1.2
trillion won in capital and be led by Uamco, a bank established
by the government in 2009 to buy bad debt, the  Financial
Services Commission  said in an e-mailed statement today.  The bad-loan ratio for South Korean bank lending for real-
estate projects rose to an unprecedented 18.35 percent in the
first quarter from 16.44 percent three months earlier as
builders sought  bankruptcy protection  or debt rescheduling, the
Financial Supervisory Service said on May 20. The industry had
66.5 trillion won worth of loans outstanding to developers at
the end of last year, according to the regulator.  About 1 trillion won of loans will be purchased during June,
the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
