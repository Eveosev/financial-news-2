Malawi’s  High Court  ruled against the
country’s communications regulator revoking the mobile-phone
operator license of G-Mobile for not starting services on time,
the Daily Times reported, citing Judge Godfrey Mwase.   The Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority acted beyond
its jurisdiction in cancelling the license and the decision was
unreasonable and invalid, the Blantyre-based newspaper cited
Mwase as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
