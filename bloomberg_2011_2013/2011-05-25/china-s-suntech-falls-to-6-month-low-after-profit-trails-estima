Suntech Power Holdings, the world’s
largest maker of solar panels, fell to the lowest in six months
in New York trading after reporting first-quarter profit that
trailed analysts’ estimates.  The American depositary receipts slid 3.4 percent to $7.40
at 11:38 a.m. New York time, the lowest intraday level since
Dec. 1. They earlier dropped as much as 5 percent to $7.28.  Suntec reported first-quarter net income of $31.9 million,
compared with an average estimate of $63.1 million among 12
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
