An Australian index of leading
economic indicators fell in May as consumers restrain spending.  The index, a gauge of future economic growth, dropped 0.1
percent from a month earlier to 279.5,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and
the Melbourne Institute said in a statement in Sydney today.  Westpac’s leading index tracks eight gauges of activity,
including company profits and productivity, to give an
indication of how the economy will perform over the next three
to nine months. The coincident index, a measure of the current
state of the economy, slipped 0.1 percent to 264.9 in May.  Bill Evans , Westpac’s chief economist, last week predicted
the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will cut its benchmark interest
rate in December by a quarter percentage point to 4.5 percent.
“The leading index is consistent with our expectation that the
growth environment will eventually call for lower rates,” Evans
said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
