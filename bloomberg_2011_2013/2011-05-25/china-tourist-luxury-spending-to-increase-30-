Chinese tourists are expected to
spend 260 million pounds ($420 million) on luxury products in
visits to the U.K. in 2011, up 30 percent from a year earlier,
said Bruce Dundas, president of retail adviser  London Luxury .  “ China  is a hugely emerging market in terms of
traveling,” Dundas said in an interview today in Shanghai. “We
have an enormous increase of visitors over the last two to three
years and an enormous increase in spend.”  London Luxury offers advice on Chinese consumers to about
300 luxury-goods retailers in the city’s West End district,
including  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) , the U.K.’s largest luxury
retailer, and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, the world’s
largest maker of luxury goods, he said. It also provides
services such as heritage tours to high-end tourists visiting
the city.  Chinese shoppers spend an average of 600 pounds per
transaction in the U.K., he said.  Customers from the Greater China region, which includes
 Hong Kong , Macau and Taiwan, will account for 44 percent of
global luxury-goods sales by 2020, up from 15 percent now, CLSA
Asia-Pacific Markets forecast in January.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
