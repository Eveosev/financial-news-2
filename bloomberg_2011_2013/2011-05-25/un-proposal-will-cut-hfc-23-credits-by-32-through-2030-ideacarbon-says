A proposal by a United Nations panel
that helps oversee the world’s second-biggest carbon market will
reduce emission credits from plants that cut hydrofluorocarbon-
23 by 32 percent through 2030, IdeaCarbon said.  The proposal would allow for the creation of 1.11 billion
metric tons of credits through that year, instead of 1.63
billion tons under a “business-as-usual” scenario, Matthew
Gray, an analyst in  London  for IdeaCarbon, said yesterday in an
e-mailed research report. IdeaCarbon rates emission-reduction
projects in developing nations.  Regulators are clamping down on projects that reduce
emissions of HFC-23, which has a global-warming potential 11,700
times more powerful than carbon dioxide, and the European Union
earlier this year banned the use of credits linked to the
industrial gas in its emissions-trading system from May 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
