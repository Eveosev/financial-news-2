Greece ’s state budget deficit in the
first five months beat targets set under the country’s loan
accords with the European Union and the  International Monetary
Fund , even as it widened compared with the same period of 2011.  The shortfall, which excludes spending by state-owned
institutions and companies, was 10.9 billion euros ($13.6
billion) compared with a target of 12.9 billion euros, according
to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-based  Finance Ministry .
The January-through-May deficit in 2011 was 10.4 billion euros,
the ministry said.  Greece is preparing for a second national election in six
weeks on June 17, a vote that may determine whether the country
stays in the 17-nation euro area. An inconclusive ballot on May
6 showed gains for parties, led by Syriza, that oppose terms of
the country’s bailouts.  Ordinary budget revenue was 18.2 billion euros, compared
with a target of 18.8 billion euros, while ordinary spending was
29.2 billion euros versus a target of 30.8 billion euros, the
ministry said.  The primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, was
2.4 billion euros, down from 4.6 billion euros in the same
period in 2011. The target was 4.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
