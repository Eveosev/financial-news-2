joining Chelsea last season, the Mirror said.  Arsenal Strikers  Arsenal is leading the race to sign Montpellier striker

newspaper said.  The north London club is asking Zenit  St. Petersburg  for 8
million pounds to sign forward Andrey Arshavin,  the  Daily Mail 
said.  The 31-year-old Russian may leave the Gunners after playing
with Zenit on loan at the end of last season, the newspaper

old Nick Powell for as much as 4 million pounds, beating off
interest from Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and Liverpool,  the
Guardian said.   The midfielder dismissed concerns that he wouldn’t get many
first team opportunities with United, the Guardian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
