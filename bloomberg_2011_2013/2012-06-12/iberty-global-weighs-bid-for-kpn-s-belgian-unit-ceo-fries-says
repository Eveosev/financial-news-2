Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA)  Chief Executive
Officer Mike Fries said he will take a look at Royal  KPN NV (KPN) ’s
Belgian unit that the Dutch phone company has put up for sale.  “We’ll take a look at it, whether it’s something we’ll do
is hard to say,” Fries said in an interview in Cologne today.
“We looked at Switzerland too when Orange was sold, and we
didn’t do that.”  KPN, the largest Dutch phone operator, in April began a
review of the future of the Belgian BASE division, which people
familiar with the matter said may fetch about 1.8 billion euros
($2.3 billion) in a sale. Private equity firms including Bain
Capital LLC and CVC Capital Partners Ltd. are among those that
may make an offer, people said at the time.  Liberty Global, billionaire John Malone’s cable company,
controls Belgian cable television operator  Telenet Group Holding
NV. (TNET)  KPN, based in The Hague, Netherlands, is seeking to fend off
an 8 euro-a-share bid for a stake of as much as 27.7 percent
from Carlos Slim’s  America Movil (AMXL)  SAB.  “It’s never an easy decision, but we owe it to our
shareholders to take a look at it,” Fries said today. He
declined to say what a decision to bid for BASE will depend on.  To contact the reporter on this story:
