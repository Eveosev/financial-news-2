Lucara Diamond Corp. (LUC) , a Vancouver-
based gem miner with assets in  Africa , fell the most in more
than three years after the company sold diamonds in an auction
for less than expected by some analysts.  Lucara plunged 19 percent to 81 Canadian cents a share in
Toronto, the biggest decline since Dec. 23, 2008. Lucara shares
have declined 5.8 percent this year through yesterday.  The diamond miner sold 26,196 carats in its first auction
of diamond output from its  Karowe  mine in Botswana for an
average of $215 per carat, Lucara said today in a statement.  “The market was really looking for a better diamond
price,” Edward Sterck, a London-based analyst at BMO Capital
Markets, said today in a telephone interview. Analysts expected
a price of about $300 a carat, he said.  “Buyers may have been cautious about what is new
production from an unknown source,” Sterck said today. “They
may want to get a better understanding of how they go through
cutting and processing.”  Lucara Chief Executive Officer William Lamb said the
results of the auction, in which not all diamonds offered in
were sold, were a “direct reflection of the current status of
global markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
