Passwords like those stolen from
 LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , owner of the world’s biggest professional-
networking website, may not lead to many accounts being breached
because criminals selling the access codes reap as little as $1.  That compares with banking passwords, which can fetch $15
to $850 apiece, depending on the account balance, according to
Internet security provider  Symantec Corp. (SYMC)  The utility of stolen
data varies by site, leading to price differentiation, said
Francis deSouza, president of Symantec’s enterprise unit.  Stolen social-network passwords have limited value to
thieves because they generally can’t take money directly out of
the accounts, deSouza said. Hackers blocked from using the
passwords on LinkedIn might still use them to infiltrate other
sites if users access multiple accounts with the same login,
Bloomberg.com reported on its Tech Blog.  “The reaction coming out of this breach is not to just go
change your LinkedIn password -- it’s change your password on
any sites where you’ve used the same password,” deSouza said.  LinkedIn, based in  Mountain View ,  California , said last
week that 6.5 million user passwords were posted on a hacker
site and the U.S.  Federal Bureau  of Investigation was working
with the company on the security breach. LinkedIn said in a June
7  blog  post that it hadn’t received any verified reports of
unauthorized access to member accounts. The company also said it
 disabled  any passwords it found were potentially compromised.  Hani Durzy, a spokesman for LinkedIn, declined to comment
beyond statements made on the company’s blog.  Customers of  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s Last.fm music site and EHarmony
Inc.’s dating site also had passwords stolen last week. Both
companies suggested that users immediately change their
passwords.  Fake Accounts  One way criminals have taken advantage of job sites like
LinkedIn is by creating fake accounts and linking them to hacked
accounts. Then they wait. The connection lets the perpetrator
monitor the breached accounts for news that someone is changing
jobs.  Once that happens, the hacker might send an e-mail
pretending to be a new colleague or someone from human
resources. If the unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious link
in the message, the hacker can take control of the victim’s
computer.  LinkedIn said on its  blog  that many of the stolen passwords
posted on a hacker site were “hashed,” or encoded to be
unreadable by outsiders. Still, some were decoded and published,
the company said.  Spam Prevention  A researcher at  Qualys Inc.  cracked 2 million of LinkedIn’s
passwords, according to a June 8 blog post by researcher
Francois Pesce. The hacker who publicized the trove of data was
probably seeking help decoding the passwords, Pesce said.  Hackers can also use social-network passwords to send spam
to that person’s friends. This is particularly true for websites
where people accumulate a lot of contacts, such as LinkedIn,
with more than 160 million members, or  Facebook Inc. (FB) , with more
than 900 million. Disabling the passwords prevents the spam,
deSouza said.  LinkedIn shares gained less than 1 percent to $94.46 at the
close in  New York . The stock has climbed 50 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
