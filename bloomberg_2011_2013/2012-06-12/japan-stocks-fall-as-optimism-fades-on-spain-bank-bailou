     June 12 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell as surging bond
yields stoked concern a bailout of Spain’s banks won’t ease
Europe’s debt crisis. Shares pared losses as the yen halted
gains after the  International Monetary Fund  said the currency is
overvalued and urged further monetary easing.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , which gets 39 percent of its sales
in Europe, lost 3.6 percent after sliding as much as 6 percent.
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest-listed
lender, led banks lower.  JFE Holdings (5411)  Inc. paced losses among
steelmakers after China’s Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. cut prices
amid slumping demand. Nissei Build Kogyo Co. surged 9.8 percent
after the homebuilder announced a share buyback.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 1 percent to 8,536.72
at the 3 p.m. trading close in  Tokyo  after falling as much as 2
percent. It rose 2 percent yesterday, the biggest gain since
April 18. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost 0.8 percent to 724.37
today, with 28 of its 33 industry groups declining.  “Today, the market is choosing to see things are worse
than expected about Spain, causing a sell-off,” said Akihiro Tsunoda, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa
Asset Management Co., which manages about $63 billion in assets.
“Officials are saying the same things about Spain, but it’s
just that the market’s view is changing. This is an issue about
 market sentiment  rather than a political one.”  The Topix fell 17 percent from this year’s high on March 27
as China’s economic growth slowed and European policy makers
failed to stem concern about the debt crisis. Spain has followed
Greece, Ireland and Portugal in seeking a bailout and investors
are awaiting the outcome of a Greek election on June 17, which
may determine whether the nation will exit the euro.  Stocks fell after 10-year yields on Spanish government debt
surged to 6.51 percent and comparable Italian bonds jumped to
6.03 percent yesterday.  ‘Demanding More’  “It used to be after one of these bailouts you’d get a
month worth of good reaction, now $100 billion buys you 24
hours,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment
strategist at Russell Investment Group, which manages about $150
billion. “The  bond market  is now demanding more integration and
the focus is coming back to growth. Nobody is looking to go back
into risk-on positions until they see how Greece plays out.”  Nippon Sheet Glass lost 3.6 percent to 80 yen.  Makita Corp. (6586) ,
a power-tools maker that depends on Europe for 42 percent of its
sales, lost 2.3 percent to 2,785 yen.  Banks accounted for about 12 percent of the Topix’s decline.
Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 1.1 percent to 347 yen.  Mizuho Financial
Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest bank by market value, slid 1.7
percent to 119 yen.  Steelmakers Slide  Steel manufacturers slid after Baoshan Iron & Steel,
China’s biggest publicly traded steelmaker, cut prices as demand
from makers of appliances and cars slowed. JFE Holdings, Japan’s
second-biggest steelmaker by market value, dropped 1.7 percent
to 1,269 yen.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , the sector leader, fell 2.9
percent to 167 yen.  Shares pared losses as the yen halted gains against most of
its major counterparts after the International Monetary Fund
said the currency was overvalued. The remarks came as lawmakers
are increasing pressure on the  Bank of Japan  to ease policy
further to support the nation’s export-driven economy.  Japan’s government nominated economists to the central
bank’s board who previously signaled support for stimulus. Prime
Minister Yoshihiko Noda yesterday tapped Takahide Kiuchi of
Nomura Securities Co. and Takehiro Sato of Morgan Stanley MUFG
Securities Co. The central bank is scheduled to end a two-day
policy meeting on June 15.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.5
percent today. The gauge fell 1.3 percent yesterday in New York.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  advanced 6.1 percent to
27.82, indicating traders expect a swing of about 8 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume was 14
percent below the 30-day average. Shares on the measure are
valued at 1.08 times book value.  Among stocks that rose, Nissei Build Kogyo jumped 9.8
percent to 123 yen after saying it will buy back as much as 5.7
percent of its shares for up to 500 million yen ($6.3 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
