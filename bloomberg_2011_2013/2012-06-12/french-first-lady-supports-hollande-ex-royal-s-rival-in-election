French President  Francois Hollande ’s
partner, Valerie Trierweiler, endorsed his ex-companion’s
opponent in legislative elections.  Trierweiler, Hollande’s partner since 2006, announced her
opposition to Segolene Royal, the mother of the president’s four
children, in a message on  Twitter  today directed at Olivier
Forlani, who is running against Royal. Royal said on RMC radio
and on  campaign flyers  that Hollande backed her bid in the June
17 vote.  The First Lady, a journalist for Paris Match weekly
magazine, praised Falorni’s “courage” and his work in the
Atlantic coastal city of La Rochelle.  Trierweiler, 47, has almost 72,000 followers on Twitter.
Her post today resulted in hashtags, or topic bookmarks on the
blogging service, of  #trierweilergate  and  #vaudeville.   To contact the reporter on this story:
