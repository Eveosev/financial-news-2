Former U.K. Prime Minister  John Major  said  News Corp. (NWSA)  chairman Rupert Murdoch told him in 1997
that his papers wouldn’t support him in the coming election if
he didn’t adopt a more hostile pose toward the European Union.  “He made it clear that he disliked my European policies,
which he wished me to change,” Major, who would go on to lose
that election to  Tony Blair , told an inquiry into media ethics
in London today. “If not, his papers could not and would not
support the Conservative government. So far as I recall he made
no mention of editorial independence but referred to all his
papers as ’we.’”  Major said it was “unusual” for someone speaking to a
prime minister to make such a direct link between a policy and
their support. He said  “the sheer scale” of influence Murdoch
is believed to wield “is an unattractive facet” of British
life, “whether he exercises it or not.”  Major is the second former prime minister to testify in two
days. Yesterday,  Gordon Brown  contradicted Murdoch’s April
testimony that Brown threatened the media boss in 2009, after
his Sun newspaper switched its support away from him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
