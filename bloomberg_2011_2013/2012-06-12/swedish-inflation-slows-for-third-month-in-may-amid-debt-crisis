Swedish  inflation  slowed for a third
month in May as  Europe ’s debt crisis hurts growth in the largest
Nordic economy.  The inflation rate fell to  an annual  1 percent from 1.3
percent in April,  Statistics Sweden  said today. That was in line
with the median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey of 10 economists .
Prices fell 0.1 percent in the month.  Sweden ’s central bank has cut  interest rates  twice since
December after growth contracted at the end of 2011. It
predicted in April it will keep the rate unchanged for more than
a year to steer inflation toward its 2 percent target. While
growth revived in the first quarter, economic data have since
shown a deepening contraction in the service industry and a rise
in unemployment.  “We expect year-on-year CPI to continue to decline in
coming months, bottoming out below 1 percent this summer,” said
Anna Raman, a senior analyst at Nykredit Bank A/S in Copenhagen,
in a note before the report. “As household demand has started
to stabilize, we expect that firms will be able to pursue some
cautious price hikes this year and to a larger extent next
year.”  Adjusted for mortgage costs , price gains were an annual 0.9
and were unchanged in the  month .  To contact the reporter on this story:
