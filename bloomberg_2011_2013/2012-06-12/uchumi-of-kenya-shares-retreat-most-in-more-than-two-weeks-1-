Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., (UCSP)   Kenya ’s
best performing stock this year, dropped the most in more than
two weeks.  The stock of Kenya’s only publicly traded retailer fell 5.1
percent to 16.60 shillings by the close in Nairobi, the steepest
decline since May 28. Uchumi’s shares have more than doubled so
far this year.  “It is a gradual down rating of the stock after it rallied
too much,” George Bodo, a Nairobi-based independent equity
strategist, said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
