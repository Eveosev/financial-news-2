Jamie Dimon , chief executive officer
of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , is scheduled to testify tomorrow before
Congress about the bank’s $2 billion loss on derivatives trading
at its chief investment office. Here’s a chronology of events
leading to the disclosure and the aftermath.  Some dates are approximate and are subject to revision as
more information becomes available.  2004-------------------------------------------------------  Nov. 13: JPMorgan completes takeover of Bank One Corp., run by
Jamie Dimon. He becomes CEO of JPMorgan the following year.
Global treasury unit, led by Ina Drew, is broken out of
JPMorgan’s investment bank and expands to manage combined firm’s
more diverse balance sheet. Drew begins reporting to Dimon at
year-end.  2005---------------------------------------------------------  February: Ina Drew’s title changes to chief investment officer.  Date unknown: Bruno Iksil, whose trades play a central role in
adding risk to CIO, joins JPMorgan.  2006---------------------------------------------------------  Jan. 18: Dimon says value-at-risk, or VaR, is “a very bad
number if you think it actually represents risk.” The number
probably will climb, according to Dimon, who says, “We are
going to build our businesses, and therefore, over time, we’ll
be taking more aggregate risk.”  Date unknown: Achilles Macris joins JPMorgan, becomes leader of
strategy that builds credit risk in CIO.  2007---------------------------------------------------------  Date unknown: CIO bets against an index of subprime mortgage
bonds and earns about $1 billion.  Nov. 26: Barry Zubrow becomes chief risk officer. Also late in
the year, Irvin Goldman, brother-in-law of Zubrow, loses job at
Cantor Fitzgerald LP after money-losing bets.  Dec. 31: Securities held in JPMorgan’s CIO and treasury reported
at $76 billion. Corporate division, which includes CIO and
treasury results, has net loss of $150 million for the year.  2008---------------------------------------------------------  Mar. 16: Assets managed by CIO expand as JPMorgan agrees to buy
Bear Stearns Cos.  Sept. 25: Assets managed by CIO increase again as JPMorgan buys
 Washington Mutual .  November: Macris’s group begins placing bigger bets, becoming
the biggest buyer in some markets. A CIO trader buys about $1.1
billion of AAA-rated portions of collateralized loan obligations
in November-December.  Dec. 31: Corporate division finishes year with $1.5 billion
profit.  2009----------------------------------------------------------  Date unknown: In the months after the financial crisis, top
executives raise concerns with Dimon that the CIO’s risk
management wasn’t adequate, according to the two executives
familiar with the conversations. William Winters and Steve Black, co-heads of the investment bank, seek more information on
the unit’s changing risk profile. Dimon responds that the
situation is under control. (The bank says executives never
complained about a specific risk in the CIO’s office. For a
complete account, click here.)  April 16: An analyst queries the rise in JPMorgan’s risk gauge
during quarterly earnings call. “I don’t pay that much
attention to VaR,” Dimon says. “A lot of that is just hedge
positions.”  Sept. 29: Winters ousted as co-CEO of investment bank in
shakeup. Jes Staley named CEO of investment bank, Black named
executive chairman.  Dec. 31: Corporate division ends year with $3.7 billion profit.  2010---------------------------------------------------------  Jan. 15: “I wouldn’t focus too much on trading VaR,” Dimon
tells analysts on an earnings conference call. “It’s really not
an accurate measure of risk.”  April 14: Dimon says on quarterly call that VaR is “an
inadequate measure of most things.”  Dec. 31: Macris’s team books $5 billion annual profit, more than
a quarter of bank’s net income. CIO finishes year with average
value at risk of  $57 million , down from $61 million in 2010.  2011---------------------------------------------------------  April 4: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  warns banks 
to scrutinize computer models for VaR for possible flaws, citing
the risk of financial loss and damage to reputation.  Nov. 29: One of Iksil’s concentrated bets on an insurance-like
product produces a large gain less than a month before
expiration as the parent of  American Airlines  goes bankrupt.  Dec. 31: Iksil records profit of more than $100 million for the
year. He’s given more leeway than other traders because of
outsized gains in prior years.  2012----------------------------------------------------------  January: JPMorgan changes VaR model for chief investment office.
By the end of the quarter, the new measure shows risk averaging
about half the level that the old model would have indicated.  Jan. 12:  John Hogan  becomes chief risk officer, replacing Barry
Zubrow, who moves to head of regulatory policy.  Feb. 13: Hogan names new team, with Irvin Goldman as new chief
risk officer for CIO. The following month, Evan Kalimtgis, co-
head of risk management for the CIO securities book, quits after
learning Goldman is his new boss.  March 31: Average value at risk falls by $2 million to $67
million during the first quarter, according to the new, flawed
formula.  April 5: Bloomberg News is first to report Iksil had roiled
markets with CIO positions so large that they were distorting
prices. The Wall Street Journal follows with a report that  hedge
funds  are taking positions to bet against JPMorgan. The bank
says the CIO hedges structural risks to bring assets and
liabilities “into better alignment.”  April 8: JPMorgan, responding to speculation that it’s engaging
in proprietary trading, says the CIO “is not focused on short-
term profits.”  April 10: The Wall Street Journal  reports  that Iksil has stopped
making trades. A spokesman says the bank believes its risk is
now effectively balanced.  April 13: Bloomberg reports that the CIO’s trading positions are
so big that they probably can’t be unwound without losing money
or disrupting markets, and that Dimon supervised a shift in the
CIO’s office in the pasts five years toward making a profit
rather than protecting the bank from risk. In a quarterly
earnings call, Dimon calls the matter “a complete tempest in a
teapot.” JPMorgan posts earnings and distributes VaR data,
which is later withdrawn.  May 10: Dimon announces “egregious” CIO loss of about
$2 billion and says it may increase by $1 billion in the months
ahead. Bank reverts to old VaR formula, which shows average
daily trading risk at $129 million, almost double what had been
reported. The bank’s  filing  shows VaR at $186 million on last
day of March. Dimon says the trading blunder may blunt efforts
to soften pending U.S. regulations that would restrict trading.  May 11: JPMorgan stock falls 9.3 percent, the most in nine
months.  Federal Reserve , Securities and Exchange Commission,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission start reviews of trading.  May 14: Ina Drew retires as head of CIO.  Matt Zames , her
replacement, shakes up the unit’s leadership. Macris will leave
the firm, Bloomberg reports. Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency says it’s examining losses and risk management.  May 15: Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  calls CIO trading
loss a “pretty significant risk-management failure.”
 Department of Justice  and  Federal Bureau of Investigation  open
inquiries.  May 16: The New York Times, citing unidentified people with
knowledge of the matter,  reports  that the bank’s trading loss
could rise by 50 percent to as much as $3 billion.  May 17: The Wall Street Journal describes how Dimon learned of
the trading losses and reports that JPMorgan’s losses may total
$5 billion.  May 19: Drew began to lose control of the CIO after contracting
Lyme disease in 2010, which resulted in her taking a leave, the
 New York  Times reports. In her absence, internal divisions and
“clashing egos” contributed to losing trades, the Times says.  May 21: JPMorgan halts stock buybacks. Stock price stands 20
percent below levels that prevailed before CIO loss was
announced. Dimon says there’s no outcome that would be a
“disaster” for the bank. “It’s ugly, but it’s going to be
boxed and eventually it’ll be gone,” the CEO says.  May 22: SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  says bank’s changes in VaR
are being scrutinized.  May 25: Bloomberg reports board risk committee lacks members
with financial risk experience. Wall Street Journal later
reports risk panel may add members. Senate Banking Committee
asks Dimon to testify at June hearing.  May 30: Zames tells CIO staff he’ll unwind the Special
Investment Group and sell holdings in owner of Ebony magazine,
bankrupt Lightsquared Inc., and Technicolor SA.  May 31: Bloomberg reports CIO valued some of its trades at
prices that differed from those at its investment bank.  June 5: CIO may lose $4.2 billion, according to estimate by
International Strategy & Investment Group Inc. Federal Reserve
is providing oversight to JPMorgan’s “efforts to manage and de-
risk the portfolio,” Fed Governor  Daniel Tarullo  says.  June 6: Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J. Curry tells Senate
the losses reflect “inadequate risk management” in the CIO and
the agency is checking for similar gaps elsewhere in the bank.  June 13: Dimon scheduled to testify before Senate Banking
Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
