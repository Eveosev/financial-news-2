Rich individuals in China, which two
years ago became the world’s second-largest art market, hold
more of their wealth in collectible assets than their peers
anywhere in Asia.  China’s wealthy hold 17 percent of their total net worth in
jewelery, fine art, wine, antique furniture, classic cars and
precious metals, according to a Ledbury Research global survey
of more than 2,000 people published by  Barclays Plc (BARC)  today. That
compares with 16 percent in Singapore, 14 percent in Hong Kong
and an average of 9.6 percent globally.  Wealth accumulation in Asian  emerging markets  such as China
is outpacing that in Western Europe and the U.S. China’s private
wealth is expected to grow by 15 percent a year through 2016,
faster than the global forecast of about 4 percent to 5 percent,
the  Boston Consulting Group  said on May 31.  China overtook the U.K. to become the world’s second-
largest art market after the U.S., according to research by the
British Art Market Federation in March 2011. Auction and gallery
sales in China totaled the equivalent of almost 6 billion euros
($7.5 billion) in 2010, giving the country 23 percent of the
global market, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
