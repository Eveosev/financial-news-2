The following companies had  unusual 
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and share prices are as of the close in  Buenos
Aires . The  Merval (MERVAL)  index fell 0.1 percent to 2,178.26.  BBVA Banco Frances SA (FRAN)  , the Argentine unit of
Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, gained 3.6 percent
to 7.25 pesos, its biggest increase in more than a month. Bank
stocks rose today after several days of losses as investors
looked for bargains, Juan Jose Vasquez, an analyst at Buenos
Aires-based brokerage firm Bull Market Brokers, said in a phone
interview today.  Tenaris SA (TS)   increased 2 percent to 104.1 pesos. The
world’s largest producer of seamless steel tubes used in the oil
industry rose in line with the price of crude in New York.  YPF SA (YPFD)   fell 8.2 percent to 67.9 pesos, its lowest
price since March 2009.  Argentina ’s largest oil company is
retreating amid speculation the government will postpone any
decisions regarding compensation for Spain’s Repsol SA after the
company’s nationalization, Carlos Aszpis, an equity strategist
at Buenos Aires-based brokerage Schweber & Cia., said in a
telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
