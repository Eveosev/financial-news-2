The U.S. government  budget deficit 
widened in May, as spending jumped 31.3 percent from the same
month a year ago.  The deficit expanded to $124.6 billion from a $57.6 billion
 shortfall  in May 2011, according to Treasury Department data
released today in  Washington . The shortfall matches a projected
a $125 billion deficit, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The U.S. government risks a fiscal crisis unless it makes
significant changes in tax and spending policies, the
 Congressional Budget Office   said  June 5. The non-partisan agency
said that without policy changes, the national debt within 15
years will top the historical peak set after World War II. In
1946, government debt amounted to 109 percent of the economy.  “I am sure there will be brinksmanship and possibly even
some investor panic, but in the end, everything will work out,”
said  Stephen Stanley , chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Having said that, Washington had
better get it right in 2013, as next year may well be the last
chance to get our fiscal house in order on our own terms.”  Revenue rose by 3.3 percent in May from a year earlier to
$180.7 billion from $174.9 billion, and spending rose to $305.3
billion from $232.6 billion.  May Budget  In the first eight months of the fiscal year that began in
October, the budget deficit narrowed to $844.5 billion from
$927.4 billion in the same period last year.  A so-called fiscal cliff is coming at the end of 2012 when
a number of major tax-and-spending changes will take effect
unless Congress acts. The George W. Bush-era income tax cuts
will expire as will a temporary cut in the Social Security
payroll tax. About $1 trillion in automatic spending cuts will
be poised to start, expanded jobless benefits will expire and
the government will approach the legal limit on federal
borrowing.  Individual income tax receipts in the first eight months of
this fiscal year rose to $731.3 billion from $701.9 billion in
the same period last year. Corporate income tax receipts rose to
$119.1 billion from $85.5 billion.  U.S. stocks rose, rebounding from yesterday’s slump, amid
optimism the  Federal Reserve  will stimulate the economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.6 percent to
1,316.38 at 2:16 p.m.  New York  time after briefly erasing gains
following  Fitch Ratings ’ downgrade of 18 Spanish banks. It fell
1.3 percent yesterday. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added
99.15 points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,510.38 today.  November Election  U.S. lawmakers are waiting for the outcome of the November
election before deciding what to do about the fiscal changes, in
hopes that voters will give them a stronger hand in
negotiations.  “If politicians fail again next year to get their hands
around the problem, markets are likely to begin losing patience,
as has been the case in  Europe ,” Stanley said by e-mail before
today’s report.  Estimates of the May budget gap ranged from $30 billion to
$130 billion in the Bloomberg survey of 25 economists.  The  Congressional Budget Office  estimated last week the May
deficit would be $125 billion. The CBO said in a report dated
June 7 that the results were influenced by the shift of certain
payments from May to April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
