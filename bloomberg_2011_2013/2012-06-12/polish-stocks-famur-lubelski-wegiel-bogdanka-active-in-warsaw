Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  climbed 2.3
percent to 2,213.31, at the end of trading in Warsaw, rising to
a one-month high.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Famur SA (FMF)  , a Polish maker of mining equipment,
declined 3.6 percent to 3.76 zloty, the lowest level since May
24 after BRE Bank SA downgraded the stock to reduce from hold.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the country’s second-largest
refiner, jumped 4.8 percent to 25.14 zloty, the steepest gain
since April 17 as oil rose from an eight-month low on
speculation that policy makers will do more to stimulate the
economy and on expectations that U.S. inventories dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
