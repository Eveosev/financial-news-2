Wheat dropped after the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said that global stockpiles in the 12
months that end May 31 will be larger than analysts expected.  World inventories will total 185.76 million metric tons at
the end of the season, the USDA said today. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News before the report expected 185.06 million tons as
hot, dry weather threatened crops in the U.S., Russia and
Ukraine.  “The wheat stocks were within the range,”  Jason Britt ,
the president of brokerage Central States Commodities Inc. in
Kansas City,  Missouri , said by telephone today. “The way the
wheat numbers are reacting everybody seems to be taking them
relatively neutral. I’m not seeing anything that stands out on
wheat that makes me want to be overly bullish or bearish.”  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 0.2 percent to $6.29 a
bushel at 8:21 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The price has
dropped 19 percent in the past year.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
