Switzerland  aims to reach an
agreement on tax and financial negotiations with  Italy  within
the next few months, Swiss President and Finance Minister
Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said.  “We agreed on the need to press ahead with tax and
financial negotiations between our countries in order to reach a
solution within the next few months,” Widmer-Schlumpf told
reporters at a joint briefing with Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  in Rome today. “Switzerland wants to be a strong
financial center with no undeclared money.”  Switzerland has already clinched deals with Germany, the
U.K. and Austria to rid itself of its image as a haven for
untaxed assets. The accords came after the Swiss government
agreed in March 2009 to meet international standards to avoid
being blacklisted as a tax haven by the  Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development . The country struck a tax
accord with Italy in 2001, while attempts to agree on a revision
failed in 2009.  Monti and his Swiss counterpart held talks on resolving
differences on double taxation and sharing information to fight
 tax evasion , the Italian premier said. He added that fighting
evasion is a “priority,” for his government.  The two countries are seeking to reach an agreement to deal
with double taxation, information sharing on potential evaders
and other fiscal issues, according to Widmer-Schlumpf.  -- Editors: Simone Meier, Fergal O’Brien  To contact the reporter on this story:
