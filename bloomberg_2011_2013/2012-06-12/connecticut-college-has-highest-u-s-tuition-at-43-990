Connecticut College in  New London 
charged the highest tuition among U.S. private, nonprofit four-
year schools in 2010-2011 at $43,990, according to a government
list designed to help students shop for higher education.  Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville,  New York , was second
with tuition and fees of $43,564, the Education Department said
today on its  website . The average annual tuition among private
nonprofit schools was $21,949, the agency said.  As education loan debt has reached $1 trillion, surpassing
the total Americans owe on credit cards, President  Barack Obama 
has called on colleges and universities to rein in costs and
make sure that students understand how much they’re spending and
borrowing for school. Average tuition at private nonprofit
schools rose 9.7 percent in the 2010-2011 year from 2008-2009,
while rates at four-year public colleges jumped 15 percent, the
report said.  “If costs keep on rising, especially as family incomes are
hurting, college will become increasingly unaffordable,”
Education Secretary  Arne Duncan  said on a conference call with
reporters. “When middle-class folks think college is out of
reach, that it’s just for rich people, that’s not a formula for
success.”  Penn State  The agency’s annual rankings also include public and for-
profit colleges.  Pennsylvania State University ’s main campus,
located in  State College , had the highest tuition among public
four-year schools at $15,250. The  University of Pittsburgh  was
second in the category at $14,936 annually.  The costliest three for-profit colleges by annual tuition
were at West Coast University’s Orange County, Los Angeles, and
Ontario, California campuses. Tuition was at least $33,544 at
all three locations, according to the report. Students and
parents should use the government’s information to seek out the
best values for their money, Duncan said.  “Please make sure that you and your student are comparison
shopping,” he said.  Duncan lauded the community colleges for keeping students’
costs down. Average net prices, that include students living
costs along with financial assistance, rose less than 1 percent
at community colleges in 2009-2010 from the 2007-2008 academic
year, according to the report.  “They continue to be one of the most affordable options
for students,” Duncan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
