Strabag SE (STR) , central  Europe ’s biggest
construction company, said it may appealing an arbitration
ruling that awarded Cemex SAB $44.4 million dollars.  The largest cement maker in the Americas had requested $150
million and interest from Strabag for the Vienna-based company’s
withdrawal from buying Cemex’s Austrian and Hungarian assets in
2009, Diana Klein, a spokeswoman for the company, said in a
telephone interview today. Cemex yesterday announced that it had
won part of this sum.  “Fact is that we won the largest part of this case,”
Klein said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
