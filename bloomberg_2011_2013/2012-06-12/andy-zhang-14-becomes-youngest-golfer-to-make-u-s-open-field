Andy Zhang, a 14-year-old amateur
from China, will become the youngest golfer on record to play in
the  U.S. Open , tournament organizers said.  Zhang made the field as an alternate when  Paul Casey 
withdrew yesterday because of a shoulder injury. Zhang competed
in a sectional qualifier in Florida on June 4 and shot rounds of
70 and 72 to earn a first alternate position.  Zhang, who now lives in Reunion, Florida, will be the
youngest golfer to participate in the major championship at
least since the U.S. Open returned from a four-year hiatus
following World War II in 1946. The youngest previous U.S. Open
competitor on record in the modern era was Tadd Fujikawa, who
was 15 when he played in the 2006 tournament at Winged Foot Golf
Club in  New York , according to the U.S. Golf Association.  Jordan Spieth, the 2009 and 2011 U.S. Junior Amateur
champion, also made the U.S. Open field yesterday when  Brandt Snedeker  withdrew because of a rib injury. Spieth, 18, is the
only golfer other than Tiger Woods to win the U.S. Junior
Amateur multiple times.  The $8 million U.S. Open, the second of golfâ€™s four annual
major tournaments, will be held June 14-17 at the Olympic Club
in San Francisco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
