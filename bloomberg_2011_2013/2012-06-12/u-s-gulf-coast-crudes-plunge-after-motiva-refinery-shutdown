U.S. Gulf Coast crude oils plunged
after Motiva Enterprises LLC shut a new crude unit at the  Port
Arthur ,  Texas , refinery for as long as five months.  Motiva, a joint venture between Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and
Royal Dutch Shell Plc., will keep the 325,000-barrel-a-day unit
closed to repair multiple deficiencies that surfaced during
startup earlier this month, a person familiar with the plans
said yesterday. The unit was part of a $10 billion expansion
that made the Port Arthur refinery the largest in the U.S.  Poseidon’s premium to West Texas Intermediate weakened
$4.50 to $7.50 a barrel at 10:45 a.m. in New York, the largest
drop in a single day since May 26, 2010, when it fell $5.95,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Southern Green Canyon’s
premium also narrowed $4.50 to $7.50 a barrel.  Mars Blend’s premium lost $2.50 to $8.50 a barrel. The
premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, narrowed
$2.95 to $10.25 a barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s  premium  to the U.S. benchmark lost
90 cents to $11.85 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium
decreased $2.20 to $12.50 a barrel.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$25 a barrel. Syncrude’s discount was steady at $5.75. Bakken
oil’s discount was unchanged at $10.50.  Demand for the largest  oil tankers  may also weaken as Motiva
keeps the Port Arthur crude unit closed, according to Arctic
Securities ASA. About 75 very large crude carriers were booked
to haul Persian Gulf oil to the U.S. in the first 22 weeks of
2012, a 50 percent jump from 2011 and the highest count on
record since 2007, according to the Oslo-based investment bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
