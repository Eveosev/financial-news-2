Iran ’s economy will shrink 1 percent
this year as the international trade embargo tightens, the  World
Bank  said.  “Product boycotts and financial sanctions are expected to
exact a toll on growth over 2012 and 2013,” the bank said in a
report published today. It predicted a contraction of 0.7
percent next year. The Washington-based bank had predicted in
January that Iran’s $480 billion economy would grow 2.7 percent
and 2.9 percent this year and next.  Iran, the second-largest oil producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is under a series of trade and
financial sanctions imposed by the  United Nations  and the U.S.
over its nuclear program. A European Union embargo on purchases
of Iranian crude is also set to come into force on July 1.  The  World Bank  cut its economic growth forecast for the
 Middle East  and North Africa to 0.6 percent from 2.3 percent. It
said the economy of Syria, where violence is escalating as
protesters confront security forces, may shrink 6.4 percent.  Foreign direct investment to developing nations in the
Middle East fell to $8.6 billion last year from $22.7 billion in
2010, the World Bank said, as popular uprisings spread from
Tunisia and  Egypt  across the region. The bank cut its forecast
for growth in Egypt this year to 1.4 percent from 3.8 percent in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
