Utilities, including EON AG and  RWE
AG (RWE) , want about 15 billion euros ($18.75 billion) in damages from
 Germany  over the country’s exit from nuclear power,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing court filings.  E.ON said in a brief filed with Germany’s Federal
Constitutional Court that its damage is “at least” 8 billion
euros, the newspaper reported. This includes lost profit as well
as money invested, according to FAZ. Vattenfall AB may also join
the suit, the newspaper reported.  Next to government bodies, the Federal Constitutional Court
has asked 63 institutions for comment in the case, FAZ said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
