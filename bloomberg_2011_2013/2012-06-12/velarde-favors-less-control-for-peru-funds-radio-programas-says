Peru’s private pension funds should
be allowed to hold a wider range of assets and invest more
overseas, Radio Programas  reported  citing comments by central
bank President Julio Velarde.  The central bank can’t increase the 30 percent ceiling on
the funds’ foreign investments until Congress has named new
directors to the bank’s board, Velarde told television channel
Canal N, according to the website of Lima-based Radio Programas.  Before adjusting the limit, the central bank must consult
the country’s financial regulator, whose chief Superintendent
Daniel Schydlowsky is opposed to any increase, Velarde said,
according to Radio Programas. Giving the funds more freedom to
invest will help boost returns for pension-holders, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
