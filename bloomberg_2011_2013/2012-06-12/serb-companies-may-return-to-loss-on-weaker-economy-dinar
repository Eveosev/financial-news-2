Serbian companies may be loss-making
this year if the economy continues to contract, inflation rises
and the dinar further depreciates, the Belgrade-based  Business
Registers Agency  said.  About 90,000 companies in Serbia’s private sector posted
net income of 84.8 billion dinars ($912 million) in 2011,
returning to profitability after three years of losses, said
Ruzica Stamenkovic, the agency’s head of financial reports.  “The current trends don’t seem very favorable” and if
indicators including “inflation, the dinar exchange rate, GDP
and industrial production” do not improve in the second half of
the year, then companies will return to a loss, Stamenkovic told
a news conference in Belgrade today.  Annual inflation rose to 3.9 percent in May from 2.7
percent in April while the economy contracted 1.3 percent in the
first quarter, following growth of 1.6 percent in 2011. The
central bank expects the economy to grow 0.5 percent this year.  The dinar has depreciated 9.6 percent so far this year
against the euro, according to the National Bank of  Serbia 
calculations, following a cumulative 0.8 percent rise in 2011.
The dinar’s relative stability last year allowed the private
sector to avoid negative exchange rate effects, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
