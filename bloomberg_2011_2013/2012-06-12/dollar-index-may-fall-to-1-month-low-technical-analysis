The  Dollar Index (DXY)  may fall to a one-
month low after the gauge touched its 25-day moving average
yesterday, according to Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd.,
citing trading patterns.  “Breaking below the 25-day moving average will bring the
 Dollar Index  into a correction,” said Takuya Kawabata, a
researcher at Tokyo-based Gaitame.com.  Initial support below the average will be at 80.490, which
is the 61.8 percent retracement of an advance from the May 1 low
to the June 1 high, he said, citing a Fibonacci chart. The index
may fall further to the 200-day moving average of 79.227, a
level unseen since May 4, Kawabata said.  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, lost 0.1 percent to 82.607 as of 7:48 a.m. in
London. It reached 83.542 on June 1, the highest since August
2010. The gauge fell to 78.603 on May 1, the weakest level since
Feb. 29.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
