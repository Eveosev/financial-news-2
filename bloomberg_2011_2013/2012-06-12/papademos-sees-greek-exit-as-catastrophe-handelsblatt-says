Former Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said leaving the euro area would be a “catastrophe”
for Greece that causes more hardship than staying in, according
to a commentary published in Handelsblatt.  Carrying out the country’s second economic-overhaul program
quickly and efficiently is a condition for the country’s
economic recovery, Papademos said in the opinion piece published
in the Dusseldorf, Germany-based newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
