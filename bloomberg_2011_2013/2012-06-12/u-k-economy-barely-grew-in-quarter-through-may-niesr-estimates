The  U.K. economy  barely grew in the
quarter through May after contracting in the previous three
months, according to the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research.  Gross domestic product grew 0.1 percent in the period,
after declining at the same rate in the three months through
April, Niesr, whose clients include the  Bank of England  and the
U.K. Treasury, said in an e-mailed statement in London today.  Data today showed U.K. manufacturing fell more than
economists forecast in April, while industrial production was
unchanged, pointing to continued weakness in the economy at the
start of the second quarter. Britain has slipped back into
recession and Bank of England policy makers have warned of
threats to the economy from the euro-area crisis.  “Economic activity remains very weak,” the institute
said. “We expect the U.K. economy to remain broadly ‘flat’ over
the next six months.”  The U.K. economy is forecast to recover in 2013, Niesr
said, though “significant downside risks persist.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
