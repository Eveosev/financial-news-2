Sugar exports from top producer
Brazil switched to being more profitable than domestic sales
after rains delayed harvesting, sending international markets
higher, according to Cepea.  Exports were 0.7 percent more profitable than internal
sales last week, the University of Sao Paulo research group said
in a report dated yesterday. The domestic market was beating
exports by 1.5 percent in the May 25 to June 1 period, Cepea
data from June 4 shows.  Rains in producing areas last week resulted in delays to
this year’s harvest and a backlog of ships waiting to load sugar
at ports. Raw sugar futures traded on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York  climbed 4.7 percent last week on the news.  Sugarcane crushing from the 2012-13 crop in Sao Paulo
state, which was delayed due to weather conditions, was halted
again last week due to constant rainfall, Heloisa Lee Burnquist,
an analyst at Cepea, wrote in the report.  Demand in the domestic market remains stable and mills are
concerned about production stoppages as they have pre-arranged
contracts to fill, she said. Some mills still need cash and
therefore sell sugar at lower prices domestically even with
limited supplies, she said.  Domestic sugar sales were 25 percent more profitable than
anhydrous ethanol last week, the type used to blend into
gasoline, and 45 percent more advantageous than sales of hydrous
ethanol, the type used in flex fuel cars, Cepea data showed.  Both the sweetener and the biofuel are made from raw
material sugar cane in  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
