HVB Group,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s German
banking unit, may schedule a meeting for June 17, the day of the
Greek elections, Reuters reported, citing unit Chief Executive
Officer Theodor Weimer.  The lender will decide June 15 whether the board will meet
two days later to prepare for the worst case scenario that the
opponents of reforms in  Greece  will win the election, the
newswire said.  The meeting should discuss how to organize transactions to
avoid being the last bank that still sends euros to the country,
Reuters cited Weimer as saying. The likeliness of such a
scenario is clearly below 50 percent, Weimer also said, Reuters
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
