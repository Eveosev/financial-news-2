Italy  is unlikely to need a bailout
as the euro area’s third-largest economy is in a better state
than  Spain , Fitch Ratings Managing Director Ed Parkersaid.  “Italy is much closer to getting to a sustainable macro-
economic position,” Parker said in an interview in Oslo today.
“It is now running a pretty small budget deficit, has a much
lower current account deficit, doesn’t have these problems in
the banking sector.”  Still, “Italy does have high levels of government debt so
there is very little headroom there to absorb any further
negative shocks,” Parker warned. “It is very dependent on the
 interest rate  at which it can borrow, which is high, higher than
its growth rate, and so it is in this situation where the market
interest rate has self-fulfilling impacts on Italy’s credit
worthiness.”  Fitch’s main scenario is that Italy won’t need external
support, Parker said.   “If interest rates are lower, then Italy, after this year,
won’t have to do a lot more fiscal consolidation,” he said.
“Its  budget deficit  is already low and its government debt will
be on a path of stabilization and decline.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
