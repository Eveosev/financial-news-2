The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments increased two basis points to
323, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 8:24 a.m. in
London. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of
 credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed five
basis points to 706. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose one basis point to
181 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers was two basis points higher at 290 and the
subordinated index was up five at 467.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
