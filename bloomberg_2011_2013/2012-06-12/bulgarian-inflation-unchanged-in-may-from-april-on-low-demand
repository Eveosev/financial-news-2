Bulgaria’s inflation rate was steady
in May from the previous month as the euro area’s debt crisis
kept a lid on demand and price growth.  Consumer prices rose 1.7 percent from a year earlier, the
National Statistics Institute in Sofia said in a statement
today. The  median estimate  of four economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 1.6 percent. Prices fell 0.1 percent from April.  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, withstood the global recession in
2009 without an international bailout.  The country’s EU-harmonized inflation will ease to 2.6
percent on average in 2012 and 2.7 percent in 2013, the EU
forecast on May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
