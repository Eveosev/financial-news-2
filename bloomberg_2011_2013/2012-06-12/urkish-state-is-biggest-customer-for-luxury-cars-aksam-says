The Turkish government is creating
demand for foreign luxury vehicles, despite a law requiring
officials to use cars that are at least 50 percent locally
produced,  Aksam  reported.  Officials circumvent the restriction by having state
institutions rent the cars, and in this way the state makes up
60 percent of  Turkey â€™s luxury-vehicle rental market, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
