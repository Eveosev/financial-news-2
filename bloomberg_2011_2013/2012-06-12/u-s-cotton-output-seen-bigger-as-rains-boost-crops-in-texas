Cotton output in the U.S., the
world’s top exporter, will be unchanged from May’s estimate
which forecast a 9.2 percent increase from the previous year,
the government said.  The crop for the marketing year starting Aug. 1 will total
17 million bales, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today
in a report. The average estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey was 17.63 million bales, each weighing 480 pounds,
or 218 kilograms. The crop estimate for the current season is
15.57 million bales.  Analysts expected a higher estimate after Tropical Storm
Beryl brought beneficial rains to  Georgia  last month and recent
storms eased dry conditions in  Texas , Gary Raines, an economist
at FCStone Fibers and Textiles in Nashville,  Tennessee , said in
an e-mail before the report.  Last year, the worst drought in at least a century
decimated crops in Texas.  The area to be harvested will rise to 10.5 million acres
from 9.46 million this year, according to the USDA report.  Cotton plunged 68 percent through yesterday since reaching
a record $2.197 a pound on March 7, 2011, on forecasts for
bigger crops and as demand waned. Futures for December delivery
fell 1.3  percent to 68.42 cents at 9:12 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York .  American growers may export 11.8 million bales in the year
beginning Aug. 1, up 1.7 percent from 11.6 million in the
current season, the USDA said. Unsold supplies at the end of the
next marketing year will total 4.9 million bales. The USDA
reduced its forecast for this year’s surplus to 3.2 million from
3.4 million projected last month.  Yields may reach 777 pounds per acre, down from 790 pounds
for the 2011-2012 crop, the USDA said.  World Output  World output  will reach 115.29 million bales, down 6.3
percent from 123.07 million in the current marketing year, the
agency said. The USDA forecast 116.69 million last month.
Consumption will be 109.01 million bales, up 2.7 percent from
106.12 million in the current year.  Global stockpiles on July 31, 2013, may total 74.51 million
bales, up 1 percent from 73.75 million projected in May, the
USDA said.  Inventories in  China , the biggest user of the fiber, were
raised 12 percent to 31.3 million bales by the end of the next
marketing year, from 28.05 million forecast in May, according to
the USDA.  The country’s imports will drop 42 percent, to 13.5 million
bales from a revised 23.25 million the previous year. The USDA
in May had estimated imports of 21.5 million for the current
year, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
