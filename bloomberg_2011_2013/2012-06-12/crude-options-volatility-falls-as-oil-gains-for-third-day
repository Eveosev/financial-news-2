Crude-oil options volatility fell
for the first time in four days as underlying futures advanced
on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will do more to
stimulate the economy.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 36.3 percent at 3:30 p.m. on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange, down from 37.2 yesterday.
Volatility reached 40.6 on June 1, the highest since Oct. 20.  Crude oil for July delivery gained 62 cents to settle at
$83.32 a barrel on the Nymex, after falling the prior day to an
eight-month low of $82.70. Oil for delivery in August also rose
62 cents to $83.62.  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President  Charles Evans 
said he would support measures to generate faster job growth.
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said
falling Treasury yields take pressure off the central bank for
further action as policy makers prepare for a June 19-20 meeting
of the policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee .  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were July $86 calls, which fell 6 cents to 25 cents a barrel at
2:20 p.m. with 2,569 lots trading. July $80 puts were the
second-most active options, with 2,008 lots changing hands as
they declined 27 cents to 28 cents.  Calls accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish bets accounted for 52 percent of the 117,480 trades
in the previous session. July $80 puts were the most actively
traded, with 7,551 lots changing hands. They rose 8 cents to 55
cents. The next-most active options, December $100 calls, lost
