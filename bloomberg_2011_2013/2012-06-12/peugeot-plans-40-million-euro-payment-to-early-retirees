PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest carmaker, will pay a combined 40 million euros
($50 million) to former employees who accepted early
retirements, a union representative said.  “This concerns about 3,000 employees, and they will get
from 8,000 to 15,000 euros each,” Christian Lafaye, a leader of
the FO union at Paris-based Peugeot, said in a phone interview.
The sum will be transferred in about 30 days, he said.  Peugeot’s early retirement program allows its French
employees to retire at the age of 55. Associated compensation
was raised following a recalculation in 2008, and some employees
didn’t benefit from it, Lafaye said. The manufacturer decided to
extend those benefits to pensioners who had stopped working at
the company under the program since 1999, he said.  Peugeot  fell  as much as 3.7 percent to 7.54 euros, the
lowest intraday price since at least October 1989, and was
trading down 3 percent at 1:23 p.m. in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
