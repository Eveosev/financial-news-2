Chilean economists expect policy
makers to keep  interest rates  unchanged at least 11 months,
longer than previously forecast, as inflationary pressures ease
in the Andean nation, according to a central bank survey.  Economists forecast the central bank will raise the key
rate a quarter point to 5.25 percent within 17 months, according
to the monthly poll published on the bank’s website today.
Economists in May forecast a quarter-point increase within five
months.  Inflation has slowed in the past three months, taking
pressure off policy makers to raise borrowing costs. The central
bank will keep rates unchanged for the fifth-straight month this
week as it studies the impact the European sovereign-debt crisis
will have on the world’s top copper producing nation, economist
Florencia Vazquez said.  “In their opinion, domestic risks exactly offset external
ones,” BNP Paribas’ Vazquez wrote in an e-mail to investors
yesterday. “Against this backdrop, we do not think the central
bank would act pre-emptively.”  The Chilean peso fell 0.3 percent to 504.9 per  U.S. dollar 
at 8:40 a.m. in Santiago, from 503.61 yesterday. The currency
will trade at 500 per dollar in two months, according to today’s
poll.  Economic growth in the Andean nation will ease to 4.7
percent in 2012 after gross domestic product expanded 5.6
percent in the first quarter, according to the survey.
Economists polled last month forecast economic expansion of 4.8
percent for 2012. The economy will grow 4.5 percent in May after
it climbed 4.8 percent in April, according to the poll.  The labor market has tightened even as growth slows, with
the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly dropping to 6.5 percent in
the three months through April from 6.6 percent through March.  Economists estimate inflation will reach 3 percent in 11
months, compared with a forecast of 3.3 percent in the May poll.
Inflation eased to 3.1 percent in May from 3.5 percent in April
and 3.8 percent in March. Policy makers target 3 percent
inflation, plus or minus 1 percentage point over two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
