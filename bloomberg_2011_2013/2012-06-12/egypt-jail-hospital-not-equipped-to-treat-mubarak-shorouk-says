The head of the Cairo prison
hospital where  Hosni Mubarak  is being held said that the ousted
Egyptian president’s health condition is critical and the
facility is not equipped to treat him, the independent Al
Shorouk newspaper reported.  Mubarak, who is being held in the intensive care unit at
Tora prison’s hospital, requires round-the-clock specialized
care, Dr. Sami Manaa wrote in a medical report submitted to
 Egypt ’s prosecutor-general, the newspaper reported without
saying how it got the information. Manaa recommended that
Mubarak be transferred to another facility for treatment, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
