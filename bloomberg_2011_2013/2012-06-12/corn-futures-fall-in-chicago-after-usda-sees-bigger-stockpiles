Corn futures for July delivery,
before the harvest, fell 1.1 percent to $5.8525 a bushel at 7:35
a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, after the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  issued its June crop report, indicating that U.S.
inventories will jump to a three-year high. The December
contract fell 1.3 percent to $5.2725.  Prices dropped 17 percent in the 12 months through
yesterday, partly on concern that USDA had predicted domestic
farmers would plant the most acres since 1937.  To contact the reporter on this story:
