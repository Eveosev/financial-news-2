China  doesn’t provide adequate data
about subsidies and other government assistance it gives to its
domestic industries, the  World Trade Organization  said in its
biennial review of the Asian nation’s trade policy.  While such forms of aid are “important features” of
China’s trade policy and industrial policy making, the
government isn’t transparent about the level or sources or
assistance, the Geneva-based WTO said today. Members of the
trade arbiter will comment about China’s policies today and on
June 14, with governments including the U.S. and the European
Union set to express criticism, as they have in past years.  “China submitted a new WTO notification of its subsidies
in 2011, listing programs providing government assistance at the
central government level between 2005 and 2008,” the WTO said.
“However, in many cases there are no figures on the magnitude
of support provided, and no information is available on
subsidies and other government assistance provided at the
provincial level, which are believed to be considerable.”  The WTO also said that while the number of state-owned
Chinese enterprises declined in 2010 and 2011, they “remain
dominant in certain sectors and subsectors that are vital to
national economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
