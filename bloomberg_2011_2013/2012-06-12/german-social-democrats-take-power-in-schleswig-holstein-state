The  Social Democrats  took power in
Germany’s northernmost state with a three-way coalition more
than a month after  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s party had its
worst result in more than 50 years there.  Schleswig-Holstein State Prime Minister Torsten Albig, a
former federal Finance Ministry spokesman who turned to politics
in 2009 as the mayor of state capital Kiel, won 37 of 69 votes
in the regional assembly today, the legislature said  on its
website . Albig’s SPD forged a partnership with the  Green Party 
and a minority Danish-speaking party, the SSW.  The change in power weakened Merkel’s position in the upper
house of parliament, or Bundesrat, which comprises
representatives from the 16 states. The Bundesrat has blocked
legislation from Merkel’s coalition, including tax cuts and a
 tax treaty  with Switzerland.  Merkel lost her majority in the Bundesrat in 2010 after her
Christian Democratic Union was ousted from Germany’s most
populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia. Half the states now have
a Social Democratic premier; one is led by the Greens.  The May 6 vote in Schleswig-Holstein, sandwiched between
the North Sea and the  Baltic Sea , placed Albig’s SPD within
reach of power after Merkel’s CDU had its lowest share of the
vote since 1950. That defeat foreshadowed an even worse result
for Merkel a week later in North-Rhine Westphalia, where the CDU
suffered its worst showing since World War II.  Merkel then fired her environment minister, Norbert Roettgen, who oversaw the party’s campaign in the western state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
