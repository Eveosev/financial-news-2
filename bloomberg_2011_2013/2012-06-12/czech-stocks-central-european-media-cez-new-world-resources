The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell for a third day, sliding 1 percent to 870.40 at the end of
trading in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)   rebounded
from a record low, rising 4.6 percent to 112.9 koruna, after the

$71.1 million as part of a plan to lower the company’s debt.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest utility, slipped 1
percent to 729 koruna, a third day of losses. Electricity for

its output, retreated 0.4 percent to 47.75 euros per megawatt-

2010.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, dropped 3 percent to 97.50 koruna, adding to a
1.5 percent retreat yesterday.  Europe ’s benchmark coal futures
