AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, will find demand for its mobile services outstripping
its supply of airwaves in some markets by next year, Chief
Executive Officer  Randall Stephenson  said.  “Our problem is not a long-haul problem -- our problem is
a today problem,” Stephenson said during a panel discussion in
 Washington . He declined to identify which markets are short of
spectrum.  Stephenson has said a regulatory logjam is hampering growth
in wireless service and forcing companies to raise prices as
demand from the Apple iPhone and other smartphones have put
pressure on network capacity.  Companies holding unused or little-used airwaves should
sell them to providers that will offer wireless service, and the
 U.S. Federal Communications Commission  should quickly approve
such sales, he said today.  The FCC has accelerated its approvals of airwaves deals
recently, Stephenson said.  “They’ve done an admirable job over the last couple of
months,” he said.  Stephenson said Dallas-based AT&T plans to bid for
frequencies that  Verizon Wireless  would sell upon winning
regulatory approval for a $3.6 billion airwaves purchase from
cable companies led by  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)   “We could put it to work in 60 days,” Stephenson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
