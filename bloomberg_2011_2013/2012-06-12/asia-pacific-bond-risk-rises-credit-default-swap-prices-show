The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index advanced 9 basis points
to 200 basis points as of 10:10 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices show. The measure is on course of its biggest one-
day gain since May 16 and its highest close since June 6,
according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index rose 8 basis points to 190 as
of 9:21 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
benchmark is set for its biggest daily increase since May 14,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 7 basis points to 196 basis
points as of 8:41 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. That brings gains to 63.5 basis points
from a low this year of 132.5 reached on March 19, according to
CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
