Gold One International Ltd. (GDO)  fired
more than half its employees at its main Modder East unit in
 South Africa  for taking part in what the Australian-based mining
company called an illegal  strike action  last week.  As many as 1,035 workers have been dismissed out of a
typical workforce of about 1,800 people at the mine, located 30
kilometers (19 miles) east of Johannesburg, Sydney-based Gold
One said today in a statement.  Limited mining and milling operations are continuing,
surface stockpile sources are being processed and contingencies
are in place to ensure that the mine, which produced 123,179
ounces of gold in 2011, remains profitable, the company said.  The company said June 4 the work stoppage by day-shift
miners who are members of the Professional Transport Allied
Workers Union was unprotected as it breached a three-year wage
accord signed in April 2010. The union isnâ€™t recognized by the
company.  Gold One fell 3.9 percent to 3.70 rand in Johannesburg
trading yesterday, while its Sydney shares last traded on June
7, down 1.2 percent at 41.5 Australian cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
