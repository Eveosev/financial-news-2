Kenyan forces want to seize one of
al-Shabaab’s last major strongholds, the southern port of
Kismayo, by August, Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  said.  Kenya’s military entered southern Somalia in October to
drive out al-Shabaab, the al-Qaeda-linked militant group that
has waged a five-year insurgency against the country’s United
Nations-backed transitional government.  “Our aim is to get to Kismayo by August,” Odinga told
reporters today in the capital, Nairobi. “Kismayo is the real
major source of supply by al-Shabaab. Without controlling
Kismayo it’s very difficult to completely neutralize al-
Shabaab.”  Income from Somali ports, including Merka and Baraawe,
earns al-Shabaab as much as $50 million a year from trade in
sugar, charcoal and contraband, the UN Monitoring Group on
Somalia said in a July report.  Somalia has had no effective central government since
rebels deposed former leader Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Somali
President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed’s government is supposed to
hold elections and finish its transitional rule by Aug. 20.  Kenya  in October said it was deploying troops to secure its
borders after a wave of attacks on foreigners it blamed on al-
Shabaab. The group denied responsibility and vowed to strike
back at Kenya with bomb attacks.  There should be construction of “supply centers” in
Somalia to enable Somalia refugees living in Kenya to return
home, Odinga said. Kenya hosts about 1 million Somalis and many
are “economic refugees,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
