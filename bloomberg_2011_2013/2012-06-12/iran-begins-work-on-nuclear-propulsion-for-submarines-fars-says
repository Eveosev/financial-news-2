Iran  is at the initial stages of
designing and building nuclear-propulsion systems for
submarines, a top military official told the state-run  Fars  news
agency.  “Since we have peaceful nuclear technology, we can put on
the agenda the building of engine systems for nuclear
submarines,” Abbas Zamani, the Iranian navy’s deputy commander
for technical affairs, was quoted as saying by Fars. “Any
country has the right to use peaceful nuclear technology namely
for the propulsion system of vessels.”  Iran is at loggerheads with western countries over its
nuclear program, which the U.S. and its allies suspect are part
of a covert attempt to develop atomic weapons. Iran denies the
charge, saying its atomic program is intended for the production
of electricity and says western nations are seeking to limit its
technological advancement.  Iran announced in 2008 that it had started building
submarines to give its military “the most advanced arms” and
maintain security in the  Strait of Hormuz .  “Our aim isn’t aggression but if someone attacks us we
will defend ourselves,” Zamani said in today’s Fars report.  The Iranian navy has 23 submarines, including three Russian
Kilo-class attack vessels, according to the International
Institute for Strategic Study’s 2012 Military Balance
publication. It also has 12 midget submarines, the publication
says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
