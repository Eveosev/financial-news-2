U.K. stocks  advanced, snapping two
days of declines, as speculation that the Federal Reserve will
opt for more stimulus outweighed Fitch Ratings’ decision to
downgrade 18 Spanish lenders.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  climbed 2.1 percent, making the biggest
contribution to the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) ’s advance. ICAP
rose 2.7 percent. Man Group Plc and Evraz Plc declined.  The FTSE 100 Index added 0.8 percent to 5,473.74 at the
close of trading in  London , after fluctuating between gains and
losses at least 11 times. The gauge has fallen 8.2 percent from
this year’s high on March 16. The broader FTSE All-Share Index
rose 0.5 percent and Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 0.4 percent
today.  “In the event that Greece turns into a problem I think the
Fed will absolutely stand up and say:  ‘no need to panic, we’re
here and we’re going to stabilize the place,’” Ken Polcari,
managing director at ICAP Plc’s equities unit in New York, said
in a Bloomberg TV interview.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  holds its next policy
meeting on June 20.  Federal Reserve  Bank of Chicago President
 Charles Evans  said he would support a variety of measures to
generate faster job growth.  Stocks fell 0.1 percent yesterday as initial optimism over
Spain’s bailout plan gave way to concern it won’t stop the debt
crisis from spreading.  Spanish borrowing costs climbed as European  government
bonds  slumped on concern policy makers aren’t doing enough to
prevent the currency bloc’s financial woes from deepening. The
 yield  on Spain’s 10-year bonds rose 20 basis points to 6.71
percent today, after earlier breaching the euro-era record of
6.78 percent reached on Nov. 17.  House Prices  A U.K. house-price index stayed negative in May as the
crisis in Europe and the end of a  tax exemption  for first-time
buyers limited demand, the  Royal Institution  of Chartered
Surveyors said.  The gauge rose to minus 16 from minus 19 in April, which
was a six-month low, London-based RICS said today, citing a
monthly poll of property surveyors. A reading below zero means
more surveyors saw price drops than gains last month. A measure
of demand fell to a four-month low.  Vodafone added 2.1 percent to 174.70 pence. A gauge of
telecom shares was the best performer out of the 19 industry
groups on the Stoxx 600 Europe Index.  ICAP, the world’s largest broker of transactions between
banks, gained 2.7 percent to 346.5 pence, its biggest gain in
six weeks.  Randgold Resources advanced 3 percent to 5,765 pence as
gold gained for a third day.  British American Tobacco Plc, Europe’s largest cigarette
maker, gained 1.5 percent to 3,156 pence.  Man Group fell 2.9 percent to 74.5 pence, its fourth day of
declines.  Evraz Plc (EVR) , Russia’s largest steelmaker by output, fell 2.2
percent to 266.7 pence, its lowest price since at least
November.  Amlin Plc (AML) , the largest Lloyd’s of London insurer by market
value, added 1 percent to 326.7 pence. The stock was raised to
buy from hold at Deutsche Bank AG, which said that price
increases and better underwriting will boost profits.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , the U.K.’s biggest home builder, dropped
1.9 percent to 44.61 pence, snapping four days of gains.  Barratt
Developments Plc (BDEV) , the second-largest house builder, fell 1.8
percent to 126.9 pence.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  slid 1.8
percent to 143 pence. The parent of British Airways has put
acquisition plans on hold as the  European debt crisis  hurts
demand for travel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
