President Charles Evans said the Fed policy of holding  interest
rates  close to zero should have prompted a boom in mortgage
refinancing in a “moribund” U.S. housing market.  “Accommodative monetary policy is healthy, yet there are a
lot of challenges,” Evans said today in a speech in Chicago.
“The housing market looks relatively moribund,” and “we
should have seen an enormous refinancing wave” from low
interest rates.  Evans, one of the Fed’s most vocal advocates for more
easing, reiterated his view that the central bank should say it
won’t raise interest rates until either unemployment falls below
7 percent or inflation increases above 3 percent over “the
medium term.” The  Federal Open Market Committee  plans to meet
June 19-20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
