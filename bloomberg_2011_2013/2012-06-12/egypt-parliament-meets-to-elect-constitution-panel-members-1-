Egypt ’s parliament convened for its
second attempt to elect a 100-member committee to draft a new
constitution amid boycotts clouding the process days before a
presidential runoff.  Fifty seven lawmakers, including independents and members
of political parties, withdrew from the meeting to protest the
“stubbornness” of other legislators, the state-run news agency
reported, citing lawmaker Ahmed Ziad Bahaa Eddin. The parties
that left include The Free Egyptians Party, co-founded by
billionaire Naguib Sawiris, according to the Cairo-based Middle
East News Agency.  Bickering over the makeup of the panel has delayed the
drafting of a new constitution, which is expected to lay out the
powers of the president. The selection of a committee today
comes after a previous panel was disbanded following a court
ruling about its composition.  “Sadly, over the past few weeks we had hopes for reaching
real consensus, but this didn’t happen,” MENA cited Bahaa Eddin
as saying. “We are forced to withdraw after exhausting all
efforts to reopen discussions to realize consensus.”  A decisive second round of voting that pits the Muslim
Brotherhood’s presidential hopeful against  Hosni Mubarak ’s last
premier is scheduled to begin on June 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
