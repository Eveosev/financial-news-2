JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said his firm’s $2 billion trading loss was
an aberration, according to congressional testimony prepared for
delivery tomorrow.  “When we make mistakes, we take them seriously and often
are our own toughest critic,” Dimon said in the remarks ahead
of his appearance before the Senate Banking Committee to discuss
losses linked to  credit derivatives  by New York-based JPMorgan’s
chief investment office. “While we can never say we won’t make
mistakes -- in fact, we know we will -- we do believe this to be
an isolated event.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
