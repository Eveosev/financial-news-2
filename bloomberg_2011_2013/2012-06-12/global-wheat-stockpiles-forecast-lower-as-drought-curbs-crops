Global wheat stockpiles as of
June 1, 2013, will be 1.3 percent lower than forecast a
month ago as drought curbs production in countries
including  Russia  and the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter, the government said.  Inventories at the end of the marketing year will
total 185.76 million metric tons, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report, down from 188.13
million tons forecast on May 10. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg expected 185.06 million tons. Production will
reach 672.06 million tons, compared with 677.56 million
tons estimated last month, the USDA said.  Daily harvest reports from parts of  Kansas , the
biggest U.S. producer of winter grain, show that “yields
were worse than they thought,” Dan Manternach, a wheat
economist at Doane Advisory Services in  St. Louis , said in
a telephone interview before the report was released.
“We’ve had reports out of several Black Sea countries
where they’ve lowered their own export-availability
forecasts.”  Wheat has gained 4.9 percent on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade since May 10, when the USDA forecast that global
supplies at the end of May 2013 will be 4.5 percent smaller
than a year earlier. Since then, little rain has fallen in
parts of Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and  Ohio ,
where winter varieties are grown.  Futures for July delivery yesterday closed at $6.305 a
bushel, up less than 0.1 percent. Prices will average $7.80
in the third quarter, Societe Generale SA predicted in May.  Growers in the U.S. will produce 2.234 billion bushels
(60.8 million tons) in the year that began June 1, the USDA
said. That’s down from 2.245 billion forecast in May.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast output at 2.212
billion bushels.  Production in Russia, projected to be the fourth-
biggest exporter in the 2012-2013 season, will total 53
million tons, compared with 56 million estimated in May,
the USDA said. The combined crops from 12 nations of the
former  Soviet Union  will reach 94.76 million tons, down
from 97.76 million forecast a month ago, according to
today’s report.  The 27-member European Union will produce 131.01
million tons, down from 132 million estimated in May and
from 137.38 million tons a year earlier, the USDA said. The
crop suffered from a dry spell in May that followed a
damaging freeze in February, according to William Tierney,
the chief economist at AgResource Co. in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
