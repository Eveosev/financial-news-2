Issuers of asset-backed securities
hired  Ian Bell , the former head of European structured finance
at  Standard & Poor’s , to lead the push for minimum standards in
European securitizations.  Bell oversees the Prime Collateralized Securities project,
which grants quality assured status to asset-backed notes that
meet certain criteria, the Association for Financial Markets in
Europe and the European Financial Services Roundtable lobby
groups said in an e-mailed statement.  The industry groups developed the quality brand to revive
sales of asset-backed securities in Europe, which have failed to
recover to pre-credit crisis levels. Structured-finance issuance
fell by 50 percent in the first quarter from a year ago as banks
took advantage of cheap funding through the European Central
Bank’s longer-term refinancing operations,  Fitch Ratings  said
last month.  The first PCS label is expected to be granted by the end of
this year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
