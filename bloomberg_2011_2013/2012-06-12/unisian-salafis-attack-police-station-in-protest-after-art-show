Tunisian police clashed with ultra-
traditionalist Muslims in the capital, firing tear gas and
warning shots after the protesters attacked a security building
and a court house, officials said.  The disturbances, in which 90 people were arrested, were
the latest in an increasing number of incidents over the past
few weeks linked to the Salafis, who view even the moderate
Islamist government in  Tunisia  as running afoul of true Islamic
doctrines.  The unrest broke out after the Salafis yesterday protested
against an art exhibition they deemed offensive to Muslims.
Protesters attacked a police station and a courthouse in the
working class district of Ettadamen and set fire to tires, while
security forces responded with tear gas and warning shots to
disperse the crowd, Interior Ministry spokesman Lotfi Hidouri
said.  The clashes were the first between authorities and the
Salafis since Interior Minister Ali Laaraidh last month pledged
to fully implement the countryâ€™s emergency laws, which allow the
use of live rounds against protesters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
