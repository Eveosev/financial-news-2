Global palm oil production may rise
to a record in the next season as  Indonesia  and  Malaysia , the
worldâ€™s biggest producers, expand crop area, Oil World said.  World output may total 54.9 million metric tons in 2012-13,
up 6.6 percent from a year earlier, the Hamburg-based oilseed
researcher said in an e-mailed report. High prices in recent
years have encouraged expansion. Production is also expected to
increase in countries including Thailand, Colombia and  Nigeria ,
the remaining top five global producers, Oil World said.  Mature palm-oil producing area will increase to 14.8
million hectares (36.6 million acres) worldwide by mid-2013, up
600,000 hectares from a year earlier, Oil World said. Expanding
crop areas may be limited because of increasing environmental
concerns and pressure from consumer groups to protect forests
and wildlife, Oil World said.  Palm oil production also may be jeopardized if El Nino
weather conditions develop from September onwards, Oil World
said. El Nino, caused by periodic warming of waters in the
Pacific Ocean, tends to bring below-normal precipitation to
 Southeast Asia  and may also affect areas of Malaysia, Indonesia
and the Philippines, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
