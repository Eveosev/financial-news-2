France ’s farm and food exports, the
world’s fifth-biggest by value, fell for a third month in April
as wheat and barley shipments declined.  Exports of farm products and food slipped to 4.58 billion
euros ($5.7 billion) from 4.6 billion euros a year earlier, the
 Agriculture Ministry  wrote in an online  report  today.  France is the largest farm producer in the European Union
and trails the U.S.,  Netherlands ,  Germany  and  Brazil  in value of
agricultural exports, World Trade Organization data show. Farm
products and food contributed a current-account surplus of 826
million euros in April, down 52 million euros from April 2011.  “Exported volumes of soft wheat, durum wheat and barley
are strongly down,” the ministry said.  France’s grain exports excluding rice fell to 534 million
euros from 693 million euros in April last year, the ministry
reported. The value of soft-wheat exports slumped 26 percent on
lower prices and a 14 percent drop in shipped volumes.  Oilseed and protein-crop exports rose to 124 million euros
from 104 million euros, the ministry said.  Wine and champagne shipments climbed to 608 million euros
from 524 million euros, while overall beverage exports rose to
1.07 billion euros from 925 million euros, helped by demand for
cognac, according to the ministry. Cognac exports jumped 39
percent, the report showed.  France imported 3.76 billion euros of agricultural goods
and food in the month, compared with 3.73 billion euros in April
2011, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
