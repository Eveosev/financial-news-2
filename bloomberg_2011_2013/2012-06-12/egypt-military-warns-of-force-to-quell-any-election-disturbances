Egypt ’s ruling military council said
it would respond with “extreme force” to any attempts to
disrupt upcoming presidential balloting and cautioned whoever
triumphs to keep promises or risk facing the “Egyptian
volcano.”  The warning by the council that took over after the ouster
of  Hosni Mubarak  last year came as tensions mount ahead of the
vote scheduled to begin on June 16. It pits the Muslim
Brotherhood’s Mohamed Mursi against Ahmed Shafik, who served as
Mubarak’s last premier.  The ruling generals called on Egyptians to vote and
stressed that they were equidistant from the candidates, the
official Middle East News Agency reported, citing a statement by
the military.  The armed forces vowed to “meet any breach of legitimacy
with extreme force and firmness and warned those who seek to
test us that they would see nothing but determination and
strength in achieving the wishes of the people,” according to
the statement.  It also cautioned the victor that if he fails to abide by
campaign promises, there will be “no patience with you as the
Egyptian volcano erupts and never calms.”  To contact the reporter on this story.
