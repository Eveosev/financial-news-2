Navistar International Corp. (NAV)  bonds
dropped to the lowest price since they were issued after a U.S.
appeals court ruled it can no longer sell engines that don’t
comply with environmental standards.  Navistar’s $900 million of 8.25 percent notes due November
2021 dropped 5 cents to 93 cents on the dollar at 2:53 p.m. in
New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The bonds fell as
low as 89.9 cents, the lowest price since the third-biggest U.S.
and Canadian maker of truck engines sold them in 2009. Yields on
the bonds, the most active in the speculative-grade market today
with 65 trades, climbed to 9.4 percent from 8.56 percent.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Washington threw out an
interim rule by the Environmental Protection Agency that allowed
Navistar to sell non-compliant engines if it paid a fine. The
court found that the U.S. agency had violated the Administrative
Procedures Act in issuing the rule because it provided no formal
notice or opportunity for comment.  Standard & Poor’s  last week downgraded Navistar to B+, four
levels below investment grade, and said it may cut the company’s
ratings further after talking with management about its
strategy.  Fitch Ratings  put Navistar’s BB rating on “watch
negative” on June 8.  Navistar lowered its annual profit forecast last week to a
range of break-even to $2 a share as it copes with the
repercussions of pursuing an emissions-reduction technology that
has prevented it from winning EPA certification for its 13-liter
engine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
