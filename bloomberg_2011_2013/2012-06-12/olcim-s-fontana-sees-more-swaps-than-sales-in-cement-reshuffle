Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  Chief Executive Officer
Bernard Fontana said swapping cement production facilities is
more likely than outright purchases or sale of individual units,
as rival including  Lafarge SA (LG)  put units up for disposal.  Swapping parts of a portfolio with another company would
not be more difficult to implement than buying or selling
individual units, Fontana told journalists at a meeting in
Zurich today. Holcim’s CEO has said he is open to “selective
divestments,” though he declined to comment specifically on
Holcim’s mergers and acquisitions activity.  Lafarge, the largest producer in the world ahead of Holcim,
plans to sell at least 1 billion euros ($1.25 billion) of assets
this year, Chief Executive Officer Bruno Lafont said today.
 Cemex SAB de CV  wants to sell $500 million of assets this year,
up from $200 million in 2011. Holcim trailed Lafarge by 1
million metric tons in cement volumes sold last year.  Fontana, a French national and the first CEO recruited from
outside Holcim, aims to increase return on invested capital to
more than 8 percent after taxes from about 3.9
percent last year by cutting costs, improving customer
relationships and potentially selling some assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
