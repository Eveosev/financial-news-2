Lafarge SA (LG) , the worldâ€™s largest
cement maker, said it is targeting a return on capital of more
than 8 percent in 2015.  The company said in an e-mailed statement that it expects
to generate at least 1.75 billion euros in earnings before
interest, taxes and depreciation, or ebitda, for the four years
from 2012 through 2015. The goals will be achieved through cost
cuts and an increase in earnings, the company said.  Lafarge, based in Paris sees cost savings of 1.3 billion
euros for the 2012-2015 period, and plans to reduce  net debt  to
below 10 billion euros in 2013.  The company expects to cut costs by 400 million euros by
the end of this year and by 350 million euros in 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
