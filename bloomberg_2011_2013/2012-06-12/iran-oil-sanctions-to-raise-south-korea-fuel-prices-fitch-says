South Korean refiners are likely to
pass on the cost of replacing Iranian crude to consumers in the
form of higher gasoline prices when U.S. and European sanctions
take effect in July, according to Fitch Ratings Ltd.  The country’s refiners, including  SK Innovation Co. (096770)  and
Hyundai Oilbank Co., are expected to pass on raw material costs
to consumers and emerge “largely unscathed” from sanctions on
importing Iranian oil, Shelley Jang, an associate director for
energy and utilities in  Asia , said in an e-mail today.  South
Korea  imported about 10 percent of its crude, or 930 million
barrels a day, from  Iran  last year, she said.  The South Korean government’s ability to restrain retail
fuel prices is limited, she said. “Gasoline prices are likely
to rise and weaken consumer sentiment.”  Traders and refiners shipped North Sea crude cargoes to
South Korea after a Free Trade Agreement between the European
Union and the Asian nation took effect in July 2011. Under the
agreement, refineries are exempt from a 3 percent import tax on
crude imports from the EU.  The increase in demand for North Sea cargoes in recent
months “is evidence of South Korean refiners’ need to replace
Iranian crude with other preferred sources,” Jang said.
“Procuring oil from the Singapore spot market is also another
possibility, depending on pricing dynamics,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
