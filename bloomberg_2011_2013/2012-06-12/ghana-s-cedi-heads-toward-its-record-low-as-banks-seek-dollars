Ghana ’s cedi weakened to the lowest
in almost 19 years as banks sought dollars to meet demand from
clients in West Africa’s second-biggest economy.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated by 1.2 percent to 1.9255 per dollar by 4:53 p.m. in
Accra, the lowest on a closing basis since at least June 1993
when Bloomberg began compiling the data.  “Banks constitute about 98 percent of the demand on the
market,” Richard Dei-Tutu, a currency trader at  CAL Bank Ltd. (CAL) ,
an Accra-based lender, said by phone today. “The market is not
liquid while all these banks have demand from their customers to
meet.” Dei-Tutu said the lenders’ clients include
telecommunications companies and manufacturing firms.  The weakening currency pushed inflation in import-dependent
Ghana to 9.1 percent in April, a 14-month high and above the
central bank’s 2012 target of 8.5 percent. The bank increased
its policy rate for a second consecutive time by 100 basis
points to 14.5 percent on April 13 to bolster the cedi. Seven of
the 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the rate to rise
by another 100 basis points tomorrow when the bank announces its
latest interest rate decision at about 11 a.m. in Accra.  The central bank on April 30 told lenders to hold all
reserves in the local currency and re-introduced Treasury bills
with maturities of 30, 60 and 270 days to help boost the cedi.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
