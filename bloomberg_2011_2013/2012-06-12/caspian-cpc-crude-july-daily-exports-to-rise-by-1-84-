The Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
which operates the only oil export link in  Russia  with foreign
shareholders, will boost daily crude exports for July from the
Black Sea by 1.8 percent from this month, a preliminary loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 25 cargoes totaling 2.52
million metric tons, according to the schedule. That’s equal to
19.6 million barrels, or 632,754 barrels a day, compared with
621,341 barrels for June.  The CPC pipeline, in which  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from Kazakhstan’s western fields to the terminal close to
Russia’s Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. Russia owns 31
percent and Kazakhstan 20.75 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO
Lukoil and a joint venture between OAO Rosneft and  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  are among the other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
