Julian Assange, founder of the anti-
secrecy website WikiLeaks, filed a challenge to a decision by
the U.K.’s top court that allows him to be extradited to Sweden
to face rape charges.  Assange’s lawyers asked the  Supreme Court  to re-open the
case to consider a specific point of law, court spokesman Ben
Wilson said. The court can decide not to review the case and
such appeals are rare, he said.  Assange lost his appeal to a lower court’s ruling to send
him to Sweden where he is wanted on rape charges following an
18-month legal fight which ended in the Supreme Court on May 30.
His lawyer,  Dinah Rose , said at the time she hadn’t been allowed
to take issue with part of the ruling dealing with a European
treaty on extraditions.  The claims by two women that Assange sexually assaulted
them became public around the same time he posted classified
U.S. military and diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.
Assange, an Australian, claimed  Sweden  fabricated the arrest
warrant to assist the U.S. in punishing him for the breach.  Gareth Peirce, another lawyer for Assange, didn’t
immediately return a phone-call seeking comment on the latest
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
