Teofilo Stevenson, who won three
consecutive Olympic heavyweight boxing gold medals for Cuba in
1972-80, died yesterday of a heart attack, the  Associated Press 
reported. He was 60.  Stevenson is one of three boxers to win three Olympic
titles, along with Laszlo Papp of Hungary and Felix Savon of
Cuba.  A statement read on the news in Cuba last night said: “The
Cuban sporting family was moved today by the passing of one of
the greatest of all time.”  In 1972 at the Munich Olympics, Stevenson ended a run of
two straight U.S. gold medals in the heavyweight class -- by  Joe Frazier  in 1964 and  George Foreman  in 1968 -- by defeating
favored American Duane Bobick en route to his first gold medal.  Promoters pushed for a showdown with American professional
heavyweight champion  Muhammad Ali . Stevenson followed Cuban
orders that he retain his amateur status, and the potentially
lucrative fight never occurred.  Stevenson was forced to forego a shot at a potential fourth
straight Olympic gold when Cuba boycotted the 1984 Summer Games
in Los Angeles. He retired in 1988 after Cuba also skipped that
year’s Seoul Olympics.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
