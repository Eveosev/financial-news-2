A commission appointed by the Group
of 20 nations is concerned about the reliance on individual
judgments in deriving benchmark assessments at oil price-
reporting agencies.  The International Organization of Securities Commissions
 published  today an update to G-20 listing eight issues on the
way in which price-reporting agencies operate that may lead to
the markets being manipulated. Among the matters raised are
conflict of interest, handling of complaints and methodology.  The G-20 appointed IOSCO in November to investigate the
role played by the agencies, including Platts, the energy and
pricing unit of  McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) , and Argus Media Ltd., in the
functioning of oil markets, their methods of operation and
governance and options for future oversight. Platts has reported
on energy markets since 1909.  Madrid-based IOSCO brings together national market
regulators from more than 100 countries to coordinate rules and
share information. The committee is in the process of finalizing
a draft set of recommendations that will be circulated for
comment before delivering a final report to G-20 leaders later
in the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
