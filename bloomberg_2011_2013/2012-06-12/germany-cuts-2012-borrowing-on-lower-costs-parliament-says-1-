Lawmakers in Germany’s lower house
of parliament today backed a supplementary budget proposed by
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  to lower the federal
borrowing target by about 8 percent.  The target was reduced to about 32 billion euros ($40
billion) from 34.8 billion euros, according to the Heute im
Bundestag official parliamentary newsletter.  “It is pleasing that net new borrowing this year will fall
to 32.1 billion euros,”  Norbert Barthle , the budget spokesman
in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party caucus, said in an e-mailed
statement, citing lower borrowing costs for the government and
favorable labor-market developments as reasons for the drop.  The supplementary budget became necessary because Germany
has to pay 8.7 billion euros in capital into the euro region’s
permanent rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, that
hadn’t initially been budgeted for this year. European leaders
agreed in December that the ESM should start operating in July,
instead of the summer of 2013, in an effort to tame the
sovereign debt crisis.  The Bundesbank and Germany’s Federal Accounting Office have
urged Schaeuble to reduce borrowing more quickly than planned.
Barthle said  Germany ’s federal government will meet the targets
of the country’s constitutional debt brake two years ahead of
time in 2014, calling on the 16 states to meet their obligations
as well.  “The balanced budget is within sight,” Barthle said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
