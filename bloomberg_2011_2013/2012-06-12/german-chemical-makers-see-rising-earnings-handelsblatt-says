A majority of German chemical
companies, which employ 437,000 people in the country, expect
sales and profit to increase this year,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing a poll of 300 managers by Camelot.  More than half of those managers forecast that sales will
rise more than 5 percent, compared with 9 percent who expect a
“moderate” decline, the newspaper said. Seventy percent
predicted a rise in net income and 20 percent said they expect
profit to fall as much as 5 percent, Handelsblatt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
