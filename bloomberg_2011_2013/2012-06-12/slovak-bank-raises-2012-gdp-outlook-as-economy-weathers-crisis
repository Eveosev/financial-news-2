The Slovak central bank revised its
forecast for 2012 economic  growth  to 2.5 percent from the 2.1
percent predicted three months ago as the economy weathers the
euro-region debt crisis better than expected.  Narodna Banka Slovenska also revised its projection from
March 27 for growth 2014 to 4.3 percent, Renata Konecna, the
head of the  bankâ€™s  monetary-policy department, said today at a
news conference in the capital, Bratislava. The bank left its
outlook for 2013 at 3.1 percent. In its previous forecast it
predicted growth of 4.2 percent for 2014.  Average inflation will probably reach 3.5 percent this
year, compared with a previous estimate of 2.9 percent. Average
price growth is set to slow to 1.7 percent in 2013 before
accelerating to 1.9 percent in 2014, Konecna said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
