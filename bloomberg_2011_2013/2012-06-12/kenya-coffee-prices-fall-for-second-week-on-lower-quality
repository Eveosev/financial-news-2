Kenyan coffee prices slumped for a
second week after the quality of the beans declined, the
nation’s Coffee Exchange said,.  The average price for all the coffee sold fell 4.3 percent
to $155.73 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from a week
earlier, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said today by e-mail from
Nairobi, the capital.  The average price for the benchmark AA grade rose 0.8
percent to $279.86 a bag, and it reached a high of $305 compared
with $329 at the previous sale, the exchange said.  “The quality was rather poor as most lots were of low
grade because dealers are supplying old crop residue,” Sam
Kimani, the director for quality at the Nairobi-based Taylor
Winch Coffee Ltd., said by phone. “The quality is expected to
improve in July with increased inflows from an early crop.”  Germany , the U.S.,  Canada , U.K.,  Belgium ,  Netherlands ,
 Luxembourg ,  Sweden  and  Finland  are some of the main importers of
Kenyan beans, according to the Coffee Board of  Kenya .  Sales at the auction declined to 5,542 bags worth $1.05
million from 5,743 bags valued at $1.14 million at the previous
sale, the agency said.  Supplies at the auction fell 2.9 percent to 14,584 bags
from a week earlier, the exchange said. Kenya harvests its early
crop from May through July, while the main crop is reaped from
September through December, according to the board.  The following are details of today’s auction in dollars for
a 50-kilogram bag:  To contact the reporter on this story:
