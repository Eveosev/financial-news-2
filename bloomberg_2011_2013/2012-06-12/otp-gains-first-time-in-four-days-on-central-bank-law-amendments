OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungaryâ€™s largest
lender, advanced the first time in four days after a report
Hungary is planning new amendments to a disputed central bank
law, moving closer to the start of bailout negotiations.  The  shares  rose 0.5 percent to 3,405 forint by 10:01 a.m.
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock  index  gained 1.2 percent to
16,999.25.  Hungary will probably present a new set of amendments to
its central bank law that take into account criticism voiced by
the  European Central Bank , and lawmakers may vote on them within
two weeks, Nepszabadsag said, citing politicians from the ruling
Fidesz party. Bringing the central bank law in line with ECB
requirements may unblock stalled bailout talks with the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
