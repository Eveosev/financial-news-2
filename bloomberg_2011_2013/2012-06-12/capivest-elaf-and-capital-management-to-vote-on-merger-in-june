Bahrain’s Capivest BSC, Elaf Bank
BSC and Capital Management House BSC will hold shareholder
meetings this month to vote on a merger of the three Islamic
financial institutions, the transaction adviser said.  The merger, expected to be completed in the second half of
2012, will create an institution with a shareholders’ equity of
almost $350 million and assets of more than $400 million,  Kuwait
Finance House (KFIN)  Bahrain BSC said in an e-mailed statement today.
The new company will have a “more competitive” edge, the
statement said.  Bahrain is home to the largest number of Islamic banks in
the  Persian Gulf  and the only nation in the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council to issue domestic Islamic bills maturing in
less than a year, according to central bank data. The Accounting
& Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions, a
standard-setting body, is also based in the country.  Bahrain Islamic Bank (BISB) , the second-biggest Shariah-compliant
lender in the nation, in February ended talks with  Al Salam Bank
BSC (SALAM)  for a possible merger that would have created a lender with
a market value of $400 million. Al Salam completed legal
requirements for its merger with Bahrain Saudi Bank BSC on April
25, according to the statement on the nation’s bourse June 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
