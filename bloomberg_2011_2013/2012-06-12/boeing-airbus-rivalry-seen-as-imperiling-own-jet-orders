Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS must be
careful not to cut into their own markets in their quest to
outdo each other with new aircraft, said Steven Udvar-Hazy, who
claims to have bought more jets than anyone else in the world.  Boeing risks encroaching on its new 747-8I jumbo jet with a
more powerful wide-body 777, while Airbus may find that an
improved A330 siphons off interest from the A350 family that the
European planemaker is building, Udvar-Hazy said yesterday.  “It’s a cat-and-mouse game,” he said in an interview in
Beijing at the annual meeting of the  International Air Transport
Association . “Both manufacturers want to out-do each other”
without wandering into territory that they already occupy with
another model, he said.  The two biggest commercial-plane makers are circling each
other in an industry worth $80 billion annually, where new jets
need investments of $10 billion and typically fly for decades.
While Airbus and Boeing are about equal in the market for
single-aisle planes, Boeing dominates in wide-bodies, a lead it
seeks to defend as it considers upgrades to its popular 777.  Udvar-Hazy, 66, estimated that he has acquired about 2,100
jets during his career. He founded International Lease Finance
Corp. in 1973 and built it into the world’s biggest such lessor
before selling to  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  in 1990,
making him a billionaire. He left in 2010 and started Los
Angeles-based  Air Lease Corp. (AL)  the same year.  Iconic Jumbo  Airbus risks order cannibalization as any improvement of
its A330-300 wide-body may hurt the case for the A350-800, the
smallest member of the A350 group of jets, Udvar-Hazy said. Mary Anne Greczyn, an Airbus spokeswoman, didn’t immediately respond
to telephone calls and e-mails seeking comment on his remarks.  At Boeing, any improvements in the successor to the current
777, the planemaker’s biggest twin-engine model, may create
competition with the four-engine 747-8I, Udvar-Hazy said. They
are Boeing’s most-expensive passenger jets, with the 747-8I
 listing  for $332.9 million and the 777-300ER for $298.3 million.  The 747-8I is the latest iteration of the iconic humped
jumbo jet and just entered the fleet of  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,
one of three carriers that have ordered it for passenger
service. Airlines typically buy at a discount to catalog prices.  The 747-8I seats 467 in three classes and flies 8,000
nautical miles (14,800 kilometers). The 777-300ER has room for
365 passengers, covering 7,930 nautical miles in range.  ‘Easy Transition’  Boeing’s strategy calls for “a full array of products with
seat-count capacity in 15-20 percent increments to provide
customers maximum flexibility,” Karen Crabtree, a spokeswoman,
said by e-mail. Buyers of the previous 747 version will have an
“easy transition” to the new model, she wrote.  Improvements that Boeing is considering on the 777 include
a new wing and improved engines. That would boost passenger
capacity and range, bringing the plane into close competition
with the 747-8I, for which deliveries began this year.  “There’s a lot of overlap, and I think that’s one of the
things Boeing’s thinking about,” Udvar-Hazy said. “By
stretching the 777-300ER and adding additional seats, it kind of
goes into 747 territory.”  Boeing ‘Summit’  Boeing, based in  Chicago , has called an “off-site-summit”
for eight or nine of its biggest customers this month to explore
which moves would make most sense, Udvar-Hazy said. The
executive, who has called himself the godfather of the aircraft
leasing industry, would be a participant in that event, he said.  Airbus’s twin-aisle A330, which can carry 295 passengers
and fly 6,000 nautical miles, has won almost 1,000 orders since
the early 1990s. To keep the momentum, the Toulouse, France-
based planemaker is pressing engine makers for incremental
improvements and considering ways to boost  fuel efficiency .  While such upgrades on Airbus’s only wide-body jet outside
the super-jumbo category may help fend off challenges from
Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, it may also attract customers who would
otherwise go for the twin-engine A350-800, Udvar-Hazy said.  Airbus, the largest maker of commercial jets, has pushed
back the first version of the A350, the A350-900, by about a
year to the first half of 2014. It was originally set for
delivery by July 2013, to Qatar Airways Ltd., and Udvar-Hazy
predicted the plane may slip further.  First delivery will come “hopefully within six months or
less of what they’re targeting,” he said. “It’s hard to tell
because so many elements are coming together.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
