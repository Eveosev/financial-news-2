U.S. soybean inventories before this
year’s harvest will be less than forecast a month ago as export
demand increased after drought cut production in  South America ,
the government said.  Reserves on Aug. 31 will total 175 million bushels (4.77
million metric tons), down from 210 million projected a month
ago, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report .
The average estimate of 33 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
was 192 million bushels. Inventories before the 2013 harvest
will fall to 140 million bushels from 145 million estimated a
month ago, the USDA said.  “Soybean supplies are going to be extremely tight before
the harvest,”  Jerry Gidel , the feed-grain analyst for Rice
Dairy LLC in Chicago, said before the report. “The U.S. crop
will need more rain the next two months to ease concerns about
declining supplies.”  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$13.3125 a bushel yesterday on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  The
price has risen 10 percent this year on forecasts for reduced
production in Brazil and Argentina, the two biggest producers
after the U.S.  Smaller soybean inventories may increase feed costs for
meat producers including Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods
Inc. Craig Huss, the chief risk officer at Decatur, Illinois-
based Archer Daniels Midland Co., the world’s largest grain
processor, said May 1 that reduced South American exports would
make it “difficult to buy beans going forward.”  World soybean inventories on Oct. 1 will fall to 53.36
million tons from 70.10 million a year earlier, the USDA said.
Rising prices may boost global production and raise inventories
to 58.54 million tons next year, from 58.07 million estimated a
month ago, the department said.  Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued last year
at $35.8 billion, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Jeff Wilson  in Chicago at
