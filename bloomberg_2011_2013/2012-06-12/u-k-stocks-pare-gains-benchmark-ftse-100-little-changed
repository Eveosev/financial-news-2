U.K. stocks were little changed as
gains in British American Tobacco Plc and Unilever Plc offset
concern that the Spanish bank bailout won’t halt the debt
crisis.  BAT climbed 1.4 percent, making the biggest contribution to
the benchmark FTSE 100 Index’s advance. Unilever rose 1.1
percent as Liberum Capital Ltd. said the company’s food unit
will create value for the shares in the next year. Housebuilder
Taylor Wimpey Plc fell 1.7 percent.  The FTSE 100 Index added 0.2 percent to 5,442.38 at 1:13
p.m. in  London . The gauge has fallen 8.8 percent from this
year’s high on March 16. The broader FTSE All-Share Index rose
less than 0.1 percent and Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 0.5
percent today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
