South Korea ’s won retreated from a
three-week high and bonds rose as optimism faded that a bailout
of Spanish banks will succeed in limiting Europe’s debt crisis.  The yield on  Spain ’s 10-year  bonds  rose to 6.51 percent
yesterday, approaching its euro-era record of 6.78 percent on
Nov. 17.  Greece  will hold elections this weekend after voting on
May 6 failed to produce a viable governing majority. South
Korea’s  unemployment rate  probably stayed at 3.4 percent in May
for a third month, according to 11 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before official data due tomorrow. The Kospi
Index fell 0.7 percent, trimming earlier declines of as much as
1.4 percent.  “The won weakened because of concerns over Spain, though
the losses were limited as Korean exporters sold the dollar to
convert overseas earnings, and the  Kospi (KOSPI)  fared better than
expected,” said Han Sung Min, a Seoul-based currency dealer
with Busan Bank. ‘Uncertainties will continue until Greek
elections, limiting won’s gains to the 1,160 level.”  The won dropped 0.4 percent to 1,170.55 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, after falling as much as 0.7 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,164.70
yesterday, the strongest since May 22.  One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, advanced 38 basis
points, or 0.38 percentage point, to 10.77 percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.5 percent bonds due March 2017
dropped four basis points to 3.40 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. Three-year debt futures rose 0.15 to 104.77 and the
one-year interest-rate swap fell two basis points to 3.31
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
