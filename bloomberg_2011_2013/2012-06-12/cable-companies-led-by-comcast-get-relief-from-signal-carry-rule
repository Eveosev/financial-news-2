Regulators will let a rule lapse
that allows more than 12 million U.S. cable subscribers with
analog television sets to receive signals from broadcast
stations without having digital converter boxes.  The Federal Communications Commission in an order
distributed by e-mail today said it would let the rule expire at
midnight.  The  National Cable & Telecommunications Association  wanted
an end to the rule, which the FCC put in place in 2007 as TV
stations replaced wave-like analog signals with digital
broadcasts that use less spectrum. The rule requires cable
systems to offer analog and digital streams of TV broadcasts.  Since 2007 the share of U.S. households dependent on analog
equipment has dropped from 45 percent to just over 20 percent,
the Washington-based trade group with members led by largest
cable company  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  said in a June 8 filing at the FCC.  Cable operators will provide low-cost converter boxes that
let customers view digital broadcast streams on analog sets,
according to the filing. Consumers Union had requested in a June
7 filing that the FCC order cable companies to provide the boxes
at no cost.  The  National Association of Broadcasters  in a March 12 FCC
filing said the rule should be extended for three years so
viewers don’t lose access to programming. Members of the
Washington-based trade group include the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC,
 News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox, Comcast Corp.’s NBC and  CBS Corp. (CBS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
