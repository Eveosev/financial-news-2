HomeAway Inc. (AWAY) , an online vacation-
rental service, tumbled to the lowest since December after ITG
Investment Research issued a report expressing concern about the
company.  HomeAway  fell  6.1 percent to $20.38 at the close in  New
York . Earlier, the stock touched $19.76, its lowest intraday
price since the Austin, Texas-based company sold shares to the
public in June 2011 at $27 apiece.  Steve Weinstein, an analyst at ITG in New York, “issued a
cautious note on AWAY before the market open this morning based
on our proprietary data analysis,” the firm said in an e-mailed
statement. ITG spokesman James Farley said the report won’t be
provided to the press for a couple of days, and he declined to
elaborate on Weinstein’s estimates for HomeAway.  HomeAway said in April that  sales  this year will rise to
$280.4 million to $284.7 million, from $230.2 million in 2011.
Adjusted earnings will be $80 million to $82 million. On a
conference call at the time, Chief Executive Officer Brian Sharples said that  Europe  is “still quite a wildcard for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
