Hong Kong stocks  fell, paring
yesterday’s biggest rally in five months, as rising Spanish bond
yields fueled speculation that a bailout for the nation’s banks
won’t halt the spread of  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which operates a port in Greece, fell
1.3 percent. Belle International Holdings Ltd., a women’s shoe
retailer, slid 2.5 percent. China Resources Land Ltd., a state-
controlled developer, led real estate companies higher after new
lending in May surged beyond economists’ estimates.  “Investors have been feeling frustrated since last
Thursday due to the choppy movement” of markets, Alex Wong, a
director at Ample Capital Ltd., which oversees HK$1 billion
($129 million), said in a telephone interview. “On Monday, the
market was bullish on Spain’s bailout news, but last night
sentiment turned bad in the U.S. If you follow the market
closely this week, you will get hurt.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.4 percent to 18,872.56 at the
close, paring yesterday’s 2.4 percent gain. Almost two stocks
fell for each that rose. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
of mainland stocks dropped 0.6 percent to 9,519.53.  The benchmark gauge has retreated 13 percent from a Feb. 29
high amid increased concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
spread beyond Greece at time when slower economic growth in the
U.S. and China is also weighing on global demand.  Spanish bond yields surged the most in four months after
the government sought a bailout of 100 billion euros ($125
billion) for its banks. European officials have struggled to
control the debt crisis that began in Greece at the end of 2009.
Investors are waiting on a Greek election on June 17 that could
determine whether the nation remains in the euro.  ‘Contagion Concern’  Cosco Pacific slid 1.3 percent to HK$9.86.  HSBC Holdings
Plc (5) , Europe’s largest bank, retreated 0.8 percent to HK$64.35.
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , a London-based bank, slid 3.2 percent to
HK$162.80.  “Contagion concern is still pretty much alive,” Eddie Tam,
chief executive officer of Central Asset Investments, said on
Bloomberg Television. “We’re staying on the sidelines at least
until the Greek election results.”  Belle led declines among retailers, sliding 2.5 percent to
HK$12.76.  Li Ning Co. (2331) , a sportswear retailer founded by the
former Olympics gymnast of the same name, slumped 8.1 percent to
HK$5.25 after projecting a “substantial” profit decline this
year.  Developers advanced after the People’s Bank of China
reported yesterday that the nation’s new loans in May exceeded
analysts’ estimates, signaling a rise in investment that could
support economic growth.  China Resources Land climbed 2.2 percent to HK$15.66. China
Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. increased 1.4 percent to
HK$17.16.  Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) , a builder based in
the southern city of Guangzhou, advanced 4 percent to HK$4.67.  China Southern  China Pharmaceutical Group Ltd. extended yesterday’s 17
percent gain, rising 6.8 percent to HK$1.88 after saying it may
purchase an unnamed company.  China Southern Airlines (1055) , Asia’s biggest carrier by
passengers, gained 6.7 percent to HK$3.45 after announcing plans
to raise as much as 2 billion  yuan  ($314 million) selling new
stock to its state-owned parent to pare debt.  Hang Seng Index futures expiring this month dropped 1.1
percent to 18,756. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  gained 2.9 percent
to 26.67, indicating traders expect a swing of 7.6 percent in
the benchmark index during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
