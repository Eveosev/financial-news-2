German cosmetics and home-care
retailer Schlecker, which filed for insolvency in January, was
unable to sell its Ihr Platz unit because trade-credit insurer
 Euler Hermes SA (ELE)  said insuring deliveries under the required
terms was too risky, the Financial Times Deutschland reported,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
