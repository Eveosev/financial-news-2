Mexican corporate credit ratings are
at risk of being lowered as  Europe ’s debt crisis imperils
expansion in the Latin American country, according to Moody’s
Investors Service.  “The ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe combined with
the slowdown in  China ’s economic growth could ultimately
pressure the Mexican economy,” Alonso Sanchez Rosario, an
analyst at Moody’s in Mexico City, said in an e-mailed
statement.  The situation “could result in corporate credit
quality deterioration in the country,” he wrote.  Of the 23 companies Moody’s rates in Mexico, 19 have stable
outlooks. Four of them have a negative outlook, which means they
could face a downgrade in the next 12 to 18 months, according to
the report.  Moody’s cut the ratings of Axtel SAB, Empresas ICA SAB and
Grupo Papelero Scribe SA in the past eight months, citing
liquidity problems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
