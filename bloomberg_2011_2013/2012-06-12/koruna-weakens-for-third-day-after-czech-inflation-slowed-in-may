The koruna weakened for a third day
as Czech inflation and gross domestic product data fueled
speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates  this month
and after  Fitch Ratings  downgraded 18 Spanish banks.  The Czech currency depreciated 0.7 percent to 25.708 per
euro by 4:48 p.m. in  Prague , making it the worst performer among
emerging-market peers tracked by Bloomberg today.  Anti-inflationary risks are prevailing in the Czech economy
because of declining demand, central banker Lubomir Lizal said
in an interview yesterday after data showed inflation slowed in
May to below the Czech National Bank’s forecast. A June 8 report
showed the country’s recession deepened in the first quarter,
fueling speculation rates will be cut as soon as this month.  “We expect the CNB will lower rates by 25 basis points,
probably as soon as at its next meeting on June 28,” Vaclav  France , an economist at Raiffeisenbank AS in Prague, wrote in a
report to clients today. “We share Lubomir Lizal’s opinion that
anti-inflationary risks prevail.”  Gross domestic product shrank 0.8 percent in January to
March from the previous three months, the third consecutive
quarterly contraction and the steepest in almost two years, the
statistics office in Prague said on May 8.  European and U.S. shares erased gains and most emerging-
market currencies weakened as the yield on  Spain ’s benchmark 10-
year bonds climbed after Fitch Ratings downgraded 18 of the
nation’s banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
