Ethanol futures tumbled the most in
more than a week after the U.S. government forecast an increase
in global corn inventories, signaling lower costs of producing
the fuel.  Prices sank after the Agriculture Department said in its
World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates that global corn
stockpiles on Oct. 1, 2013, will be 155.74 million metric tons,
up 2.2 percent from the May forecast. Ethanol in the U.S. is
derived from the grain.  “The WASDE report was actually bearish,” said  Ian
Jackson , a trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago. “You’re
feeling better, not great. Any day that you can gain back a
couple of pennies is good.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery slumped 2.5 cents, or
1.2 percent, to settle at $2.036 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the lowest price since June 5 and the steepest decline
since June 1. Prices have fallen 7.6 percent this year.  In spot market trading ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
and in the U.S. Gulf at $2.08 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.01 and
on the West Coast at $2.17 a gallon, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Corn for July delivery sank 8 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
$5.84 a bushel. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
biofuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
