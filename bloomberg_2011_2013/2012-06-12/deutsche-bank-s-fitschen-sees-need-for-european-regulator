Juergen Fitschen, the co-chief
executive officer of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , said he’s “generally”
in favor of a banking union and a European banking regulator as
the current system dominated by national interests is not
sustainable.  “In general we are in favor of a banking union, but our
current problems will not be solved by it,” Fitschen said at a
conference today in Frankfurt. “The banking crisis in  Spain 
would not be solved by a European regulator.”  Before a summit in Brussels this month, European leaders
like  Angela Merkel  and  Francois Hollande  have focused on the
idea of a banking union that would include a single European
regulator, euro-wide  deposit insurance  and a common bank
resolution fund. The ideas are aimed at preventing banking
crises in the future and protecting taxpayers from having to
foot the bill for bank bailouts.  There are many unanswered questions on the way toward an
European regulator overseeing the biggest European banks,
Fitschen said. Regulators should keep in mind that European
banks need to stay globally competitive, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
