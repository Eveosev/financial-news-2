TomTom NV (TOM2) ,  Europe ’s largest maker of
portable navigation devices, advanced the most in more than
seven months in Amsterdam after  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  agreed to use its
digital maps in new mobile services.  TomTom  rose  16 percent to 3.80 euros, the largest increase
since Oct. 24. The stock was the biggest gainer on the 25-
company benchmark AEX Index, paring TomTom’s 12-month decline to
30 percent.  TomTom said today that its global agreement with Apple
covers maps and related information after the maker of the
iPhone and iPad yesterday unveiled the next version of its
mobile software, adding maps to ratchet up pressure on Google
Inc. Richard Piekaar, a spokesman for the Amsterdam-based
company, declined to provide further details.  “The deal is a boost for TomTom because of the huge
installed base of Apple product users and because of the brand
and all that it stands for itself: innovation, ease of use and
quality,” Martijn den Drijver, an Amsterdam-based analyst at
SNS Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Den Drijver has a
accumulate recommendation on TomTom shares.  TomTom, which dominated the navigation industry before
 Google (GOOG)  and Apple took market share with similar services on
smartphones, provides digital maps that cover more than 200
countries and territories.  The financial implications of the agreement with Apple are
less clear, Den Drijver said. “TomTom’s fee will largely depend
on advertising revenue and a small nominal fee per map if turn-
by-turn navigation is used, while it does stand to lose the
regular navigation application revenue from the iTunes store.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
