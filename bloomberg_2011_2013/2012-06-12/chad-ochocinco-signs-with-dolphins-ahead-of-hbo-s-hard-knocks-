Former All-Pro wide receiver Chad Ochocinco signed with the  Miami Dolphins , who will participate
in the HBO Sports reality television show “Hard Knocks” during
the National Football League preseason.  Ochocinco, 34, was released by the  New England Patriots  on
June 7 after catching 15 passes in 15 games last season. The
two-time All Pro and six-time Pro Bowl selection spent his first
10 NFL seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals, catching 751 passes
for 10,783 yards and 66 touchdowns.  Ochocinco, who was born in Miami and in 2008 changed his
last name from Johnson, briefly appeared on his own television
reality show and in 2010 participated on ABC’s “Dancing with
the Stars.” He now joins the team that will be featured on
“Hard Knocks,” which will chronicle the Dolphins’ training
camp and preseason during coach Joe Philbin’s first season.  Legedu Naanee and Davone Bess are the Dolphins’ only
receivers who have played more than two NFL seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
