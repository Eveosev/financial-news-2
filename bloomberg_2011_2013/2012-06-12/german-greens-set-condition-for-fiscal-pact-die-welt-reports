Germany’s opposition  Green Party 
won’t support a fiscal pact on euro-area budgetary discipline
without a debt repayment fund,  Die Welt  reported, citing an
interview with Lisa Paus, a member of parliament who has been
involved in negotiations.  The fiscal pact stipulates only that everyone should save
and doesn’t determine how debt will be cut, the newspaper cited
Paus as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
