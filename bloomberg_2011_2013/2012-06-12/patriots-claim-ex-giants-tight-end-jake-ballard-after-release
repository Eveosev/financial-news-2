The New England Patriots yesterday
signed tight end  Jake Ballard , a day after he failed a physical
and was waived by the New York Giants.  Ballard, 24, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his
left knee during the Giantsâ€™ 21-17 Super Bowl win against the
Patriots in February. He spent the past two seasons with the
Giants after entering the National Football League as a rookie
free agent out of Ohio State University.  The 6-foot-6, 275-pound Ballard caught 38 passes for 604
yards and four touchdowns last season, when he played in 14
regular-season games, with 13 starts. He had five postseason
receptions, including two against the Patriots in the Super Bowl
before his injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
