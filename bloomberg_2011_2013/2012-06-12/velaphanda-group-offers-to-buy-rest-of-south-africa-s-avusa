Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  gained the most in more
than a year after  Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG)  offered to buy the
shares it doesn’t already own in the publisher of South Africa’s
biggest Sunday newspaper.  The stock climbed 8.8 percent to 22.31 rand at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, the biggest gain since March 2011.
Mvelaphanda’s Richtrau Ltd. unit will pay 24 rand in cash or
1.48 Richtrau shares for each share of Johannesburg-based Avusa,
the companies said in a statement today. Richtrau already owns
21.3 percent of Avusa.  Mvelaphanda, an investment company with stakes in Absa
Group Ltd. and construction company  Group Five Ltd. (GRF) , will
distribute Richtrau stock to its shareholders before listing the
unit on the  Johannesburg Stock Exchange , it said. Mvelaphanda
said it has received commitments from shareholders holding 65
percent of Avusa’s shares.  The new company will be led by Colin Cary as chief
executive officer, Andrew Bonamour, the chief executive officer
of Mvelaphanda, said in a telephone interview today. Cary is the
company’s non-executive director.  “There will be no wholesale changes, we’ve earmarked Colin
as the CEO and the rest of the team will stay on as it is,”
Bonamour said. “We’ll just strengthen the management and take
it from there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
