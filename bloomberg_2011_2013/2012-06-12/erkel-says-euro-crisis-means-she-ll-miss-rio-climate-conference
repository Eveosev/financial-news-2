German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that she’ll miss the climate conference in  Rio de Janeiro 
because she has to return to Europe to prepare for a European
Union summit on the financial crisis.  “I had to decide for scheduling reasons” to return to
Germany after the June 18-19 Group of 20 summit in Mexico
because of the “challenges” in the euro area, including the EU
summit on Jan 28-29, Merkel told reporters in Berlin today.  Germany will still be well represented at the Rio+20
climate conference next week, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
