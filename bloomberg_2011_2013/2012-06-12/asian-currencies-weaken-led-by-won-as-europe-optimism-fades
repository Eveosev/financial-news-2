Asian currencies weakened, led by
South Korea’s won and India’s rupee, as optimism a 100 billion
euro ($125 billion) bailout of Spain’s banks will stem Europe’s
debt crisis faded.  Yields on Spanish and Italian bonds rose yesterday ahead of
auctions in Italy this week and elections on June 17 that may
determine whether Greece stays in the euro. The  MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index (MXAP)  of regional shares dropped 0.6 percent.  “It’s clear that investors don’t believe this small step
will put an end to the Europe crisis,” said Tarsicio Tong, a
foreign-exchange trader at Union Bank of Taiwan in Taipei. “The
 U.S. dollar  will stay strong for a while.”  The rupee dropped 0.4 percent to 55.9350 per dollar as of
2:19 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,170.55, Malaysia’s ringgit
fell 0.4 percent to 3.1840 and Taiwan’s dollar retreated 0.2
percent to NT$29.991.  Global funds have sold $1 billion more Taiwanese, South
Korean and Indonesian shares than they bought this month,
exchange data show, on concern  Europe ’s crisis will slow global
growth and crimp demand for Asian exports.  Bank Indonesia held its benchmark interest rate at 5.75
percent today, while Thailand and the Philippines are also
expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged this week, according
to Bloomberg surveys.  ’Uncertainties Will Continue’  The rupee fell after  Standard & Poor’s  warned the nation
may lose its investment-grade  credit rating . Slowing growth and
political roadblocks threaten India’s BBB- rating, which is one
level above junk, S&P said in a statement yesterday.  The won retreated from a three-week high ahead of data
tomorrow that is expected to show the  unemployment rate  stayed
at 3.4 percent in May for a third month, according to 11
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Kospi Index fell 0.7
percent, trimming an earlier decline of as much as 1.4 percent.  “The won weakened because of concerns over  Spain , though
the losses were limited as Korean exporters sold the dollar to
convert overseas earnings, and the Kospi fared better than
expected,” said Han Sung Min, a Seoul-based currency dealer
at Busan Bank. “Uncertainties will continue until the Greek
elections, limiting the won’s gains to the 1,160 level.”  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht dropped 0.2 percent to 31.68 per
dollar. China’s  yuan  was steady at 6.3703, Indonesia’s rupiah
was little changed at 9,450, while the Vietnamese dong gained
0.2 percent to 20,940. Financial markets in the Philippines are
closed for a public holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
