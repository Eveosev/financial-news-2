India ’s rupee dropped for a third
day after  Standard & Poor’s  warned the nation may lose its
investment-grade  credit rating .  The currency touched a one-week low after S&P said in a
statement yesterday that slowing growth and political roadblocks
threatened India’s BBB- rating, which is one level above junk. A
government report due today may show  industrial production  in
April increased less than the 1.7 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 37 analysts, according to Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. Wholesale prices rose 7.50 percent in
May, compared with 7.23 percent in April, according to another
Bloomberg survey before data due June 14.  “This week’s data releases will further drive home the
dilemma confronting policy makers,” Leong Sook Mei, the
Singapore-based regional head of global currency research at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, wrote in a report today. “The rupee
looks vulnerable again,” she wrote, adding that the currency
may weaken past 56 per dollar.  The rupee declined 0.1 percent to 55.785 per dollar as of
9:56 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 55.865 earlier, the weakest level since June 5. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, rose 30 basis points, or 0.30 percentage point,
to 12 percent.  Three-month onshore currency forwards traded at 56.71 a
dollar, compared with 56.67 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.89 from 56.92. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
