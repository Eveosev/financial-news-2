JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) ,  China ’s
largest solar-cell maker, may produce outside China to avoid
U.S. anti-dumping tariffs.  The company will await a final decision from the U.S.
Commerce Department on the tariffs, Chief Executive Officer Peng Fang said. The agency last month plans antidumping duties of 31
percent to 250 percent on Chinese solar manufacturers after
ruling they sold products below cost.  The tariff “is based on a significant misunderstanding,”
Fang said today at the Intersolar conference in Munich. “A
trade barrier is not good for the U.S. because it will lead to
much higher costs for customers.”  The comments highlight growing tensions between European
and U.S. governments and the Chinese state over its aid for
renewable-energy companies.  Solarworld AG (SWV) , Germany’s biggest
panel-maker, expects an anti-dumping case to start against
Chinese competitors in Europe this month after the German
government said it may support such a move.  To contact the reporters on this story:
