The European Commission thinks that
a financial transaction tax could be passed in nine states of
the European Union this year if that number of governments
agrees to it by July,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  Nine states are the minimum for a common initiative in a
smaller group in case not all 27 members agree on an issue, the
newspaper said in a preview of an article for tomorrowâ€™s
edition, citing unidentified people close to EU commissioner
Algirdas Semeta.  To contact the reporters on this story:
