Peru’s sol-denominated bonds fell,
pushing up yields to their highest in a week, as skepticism that
 Spain ’s bailout plan will ease the euro zone’s debt crisis
curbed demand for the nation’s financial assets.  The yield on the benchmark 7.84 percent bond due in August
2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.19
percent at 1:45 p.m. in Lima, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That was the highest level since June 5. The price
decreased 0.09 centimo to 117.35 centimos per sol.  “We had a little bit of relief and then a lot of
disappointment related to Spain,” said  Enrique Alvarez , the
head of Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in New
York.  Spain’s bond yields rose to a record today amid concern a
100 billion-euro ($125 billion) lifeline for the country’s banks
won’t be enough to stabilize the economy.  The sol weakened almost 0.1 percent to 2.6835 per  U.S.
dollar , from 2.6815 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s
local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
