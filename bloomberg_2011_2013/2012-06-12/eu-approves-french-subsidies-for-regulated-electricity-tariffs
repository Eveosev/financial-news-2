European Union antitrust officials
conditionally approved French state subsidies that form part of
regulated electricity tariffs for large energy consumers.  The approval ends the EU’s probe into below-market rate
“Tartam” tariffs for large, energy-consuming companies such as
steelmakers that were used between 2006 and 2011, and so-called
green and yellow regulated tariffs for companies.  France  must review the standard tariffs every year and
phase them out by the end of 2015 as a condition of the EU
authorization, the European Commission said in a statement.  There should be a “gradual shift to cost-based pricing
every year after summer 2012” until the tariffs are eliminated,
the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
