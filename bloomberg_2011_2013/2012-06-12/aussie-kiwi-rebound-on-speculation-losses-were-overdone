The  New Zealand dollar  touched an
almost one-month high as Asian stocks extended a global rally,
sustaining demand for riskier assets.  The so-called kiwi traded 0.3 percent from the strongest in
four weeks against its Australian counterpart before a  Reserve
Bank  of New Zealand meeting tomorrow where policy makers are
expected to leave  interest rates  unchanged. The Australia’s
dollar slid as data showed the nation’s  consumer confidence 
stagnated near the lowest level this year. Demand for both
currencies was limited ahead of a June 17 election in  Greece ,
where debt woes have risked a breakup of the euro zone and
shaken global investor confidence.  “When there is a bit of risk appetite, you don’t need much
for strength to come back” in the Aussie and kiwi, said Greg Gibbs, a senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in Sydney. “While you want to have some havens, you
also want some exposure to inflation hedges.”  The  New Zealand  dollar earlier touched 77.89 U.S. cents,
the highest since May 15, before trading at 77.62 cents as of
11:29 a.m. in Sydney, down 0.1 percent from yesterday when it
gained 1.1 percent. It traded at 61.82 yen from 61.81.  Australia’s currency was at NZ$1.2815 from NZ$1.2812
yesterday, when it touched NZ$1.2773, the least since May 11.
The Aussie slid 0.1 percent to 99.46 U.S. cents from yesterday,
when it jumped 1 percent. On June 11, it touched $1.0009, the
highest since May 15. It bought 79.22  yen  after advancing 1.1
percent yesterday.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks added 0.3 percent,
following a 0.7 percent advance in the  MSCI’s World Index (MXWO) 
yesterday. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.2 percent
yesterday.  RBNZ Policy  All 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect New
Zealand’s central bank to keep its key interest rate unchanged
at 2.5 percent when policy makers meet tomorrow.  “Should the  exchange rate  remain strong without anything
else changing, the bank would need to reassess the outlook for
monetary policy settings,” RBNZ Governor Alan Bollard said in a
statement in Wellington on April 26 after holding the official
rate.  A  Credit Suisse Group AG index  based on swaps indicates the
RBNZ will lower rates by 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage
point, over the next 12 months, compared to 44 basis points
indicated on June 4.  “In previous meetings, RBNZ expressed a lot of concern on
the strength of their currency,” said RBS’s Gibbs. “I think
that concern will show up less in the statement this time. On
balance, we could see the statement being supportive of the
kiwi.”  ‘Pretty High’  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  said in
Brisbane today that the nation’s real exchange rate is “pretty
high here.” A consumer sentiment index for June rose 0.3
percent to 95.6, a  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne Institute
survey taken June 4-10 of 1,200 consumers showed today in
Sydney.  Moody’s Investors Service today said Australia’s top Aaa
rating outlook remains stable, and the country’s economic
strength is “very high.”  Australia’s government bonds declined, pushing the yield on
the 10-year security up by five basis points to 3.03 percent.
Yields on the three-year government note rose six basis points
to 2.35 percent.  Greece’s election looms as concerns of debt contagion drive
bonds lower in Spain and Italy, which is scheduled to sell
securities today and tomorrow.  “ Europe  will remain a key market driver for the
foreseeable future,” a Barclays Capital research team led by
Larry Kantor wrote in a research note today. Barclays prefers to
“fade” rallies in risky currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
