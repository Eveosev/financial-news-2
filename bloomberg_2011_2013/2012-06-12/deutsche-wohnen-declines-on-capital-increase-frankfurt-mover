Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI)  fell for a fourth
day in Frankfurt trading after  Germany ’s third-largest
residential landlord by market value said it would  sell more
shares  than some analysts expected to pay for an acquisition.  Deutsche Wohnen dropped as much as 4.2 percent to 11.14
euros, the lowest in a month. The stock was the biggest decliner
on Germany’s  DAX Mid-Cap Index (MDAX) , which fell 0.2 percent.  The Frankfurt-based company announced a plan to raise as
much as 475 million euros ($594 million) in a capital increase
yesterday. Most of the proceeds will be spent on the purchase of
almost 23,500 apartments from  Barclays Plc (BARC) , a transaction valued
at 1.24 billion euros.  “The capital increase was a bit higher than expected,”
said Kai Klose, an analyst at Berenberg Bank with a buy rating
on the stock. Klose expected Deutsch Wohnen to raise about 380
million euros from the share sale. Frank Neumann, an analyst at
Bankhaus Lampe who also has a buy rating, anticipated that the
company would seek about 300 million euros.  Both analysts said the additional capital will enable
Deutsche Wohnen to make more acquisitions, which will probably
bolster the stock in the months ahead.  Deutsche Wohnen was down about 3 percent at 11.29 euros at
3:36 p.m., cutting its market value to 1.65 billion euros. The
shares have lost 10 percent in the past four days, paring the
gain for the last 12 months to 6.3 percent, a period in which
the 50-member index known as the MDAX has declined 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
