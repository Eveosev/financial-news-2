Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) , the bankrupt
photographic-equipment company trying to sell its patent
portfolio, said 20 parties have signed non-disclosure agreements
in order to be able to view confidential information about the
patents as well as get access to an electronic-data room.  Kodak filed a motion with the bankruptcy court asking the
judge to approve an auction process for more than 1,100 patents
that will keep secret all bidder names and the dollar values of
the bids, the Rochester, New York-based company said today in a
statement.  Kodak asked the judge to authorize a process that will
result in winning bidders being announced on Aug. 13, according
to the statement. Kodak will ask bidders to submit bids by the
end of July, people with knowledge of the matter said.  The company hired Lazard Ltd. more than a year ago to try
and find buyers for the patents. The photography pioneer that
introduced the Brownie camera more than a century ago filed for
bankruptcy on Jan. 19 as the rise of digital photography
impaired its high-margin film business.  To contact the reporters on this story:
