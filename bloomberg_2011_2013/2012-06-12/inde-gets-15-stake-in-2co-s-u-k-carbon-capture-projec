Linde AG (LIN) , a German producer of
industrial and medical gases, acquired a 15 percent stake in a
carbon-capture and storage project that 2Co Energy Ltd. is
building in northern England.  Linde’s U.K. unit BOC Group will supply the carbon-capture
technology and air separation units for the Don Valley Power
Project, London-based 2Co Energy said today in a statement.
Terms weren’t disclosed.  Don Valley, a 650-megawatt coal-fired power plant in South
Yorkshire that’s expected to be complete in 2016, is designed to
capture at least 90 percent of its emissions, BOC said in the
statement. The Yorkshire-Humber region, a center for coal power,
contributes around 18 percent of the U.K.’s annual carbon
dioxide emissions.  Samsung Group  agreed in March to buy a 15 percent stake in
Don Valley, which will cost about 3 billion pounds ($4.67
billion).  BOC is also providing carbon-capture technology for a 426-
megawatt Alstom SA and  Drax Group Plc (DRX)  power plant in northern
England.  To contact the reporter on this story:
