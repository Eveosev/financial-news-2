The  U.S. economy  will continue to
struggle for the next few months as some business owners wait
for the national election before making investments, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said.  “I think we’re in a tough position for the next three or
four or five months,” Blankfein said today in an interview on
MSNBC. “There’s a lot of uncertainty.”  Business owners aren’t sure what the results of the U.S.
election will be or how it will affect their taxes, he said. A
common view is that “it’s going to be very consequential so I
think I’ll wait -- I think there’s a lot of that going on,”
Blankfein said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
