Hungary will probably present
amendments to a disputed central bank law and lawmakers may vote
on them within two weeks,  Nepszabadsag  said, citing Antal Rogan,
head of the ruling Fidesz party’s parliamentary group.  The government regards the  European Central Bank ’s
criticism of the law as “eventually acceptable,”  Mihaly Varga ,
the country’s chief negotiator for an International Monetary
Fund loan told the Budapest-based newspaper. He  confirmed that
a new set of amendments may be submitted to the law. Current
talks with the ECB focus on the central bank’s foreign-currency
reserves, the politician told Nepszabadsag.  Varga plans to hold consultations with Magyar Nemzeti Bank
President Andras Simor and Vice President Ferenc Karvalits on
the issue, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
