U.S. gasoline demand fell 0.5
percent last week to a five-week low even as prices at the pump
declined further, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 8.97 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended June 8, down from 9.01 million the week before,
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed.  The average pump price declined 5 cents in the past week to
$3.58 a gallon, the lowest level since Feb. 17. Prices are 4.5
percent below a year earlier.  The highest prices were on the West Coast, where the
average fell 7 cents to $4.13 a gallon. The lowest prices were
on the  Gulf Coast , where a gallon declined 5 cents to $3.37.  Fuel consumption was 3.5 percent below the year-earlier
level, the 41st straight drop in that measure. Year-to-date
gasoline demand is 4.8 percent below 2011.  “This past week was the third in a row of increasing year-
over-year declines, even while prices at the pump continued to
fall and have fallen over 35 cents since peaking at $3.94 for
the week ending April 6,” John Gamel, a gasoline analyst and
director of economic analysis for SpendingPulse, said in the
report.  Fuel use over the previous four weeks fell 1.9 percent
below the same period in 2011, a record 64th consecutive drop in
that measure.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
