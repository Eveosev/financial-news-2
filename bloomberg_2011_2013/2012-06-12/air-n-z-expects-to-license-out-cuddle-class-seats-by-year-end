Air New Zealand Ltd. (AIR)  expects to
reach the first agreement for licensing out its “cuddle-class”
coach seats by the end of the year as passenger demand for the
units helps bolster long-haul ticket sales.  The airline has had talks with about 12 carriers interested
in the Skycouch seats and it is close to getting the final
certification needed to license them, Chief Executive Officer
Rob Fyfe said in an interview yesterday at the  International Air
Transport Association ’s annual meeting in Beijing. The  unit ,
developed by the Auckland-based carrier, converts from a three-
seat set-up into a bed for two.  “We won’t offer to other airlines unless they are prepared
to pay us a rich amount of money,” Fyfe said. A deal may be in
place “towards the end of the year,” he said. Air N.Z. paid
“several million dollars” to license a business-class seat
design from Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., he said.  Air N.Z. may also fit more of the seats onto its own planes
because they sell 30 percent quicker than standard coach tickets
and generate higher yields, Fyfe said. The airline began flying
Boeing Co. 777s fitted with the seats last year to help compete
with Emirates Airline and  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  on long-haul
routes.  --Jasmine Wang and Andrea Rothman. Editors: Neil Denslow,  Garry Smith   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
