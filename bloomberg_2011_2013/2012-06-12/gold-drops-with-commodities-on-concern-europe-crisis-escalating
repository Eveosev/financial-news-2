Gold gained for the third straight
session in  New York  on speculation that policy makers will
announce additional stimulus measures to boost growth,
increasing demand for bullion as a hedge against inflation.  Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago President  Charles Evans 
said he would support a variety of measures to generate faster
job growth, underscoring his preference for more action. Spain
has a “fair chance” to demonstrate its capacity to solve its
banking woes after indicating it will require a bailout,
Finland’s Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  said.  “The market is expecting more stimulus, and that is
supportive of gold,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker
at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  Gold futures for August delivery advanced 1.1 percent to
settle at $1,613.80 an ounce at 1:57 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices gained 0.6 percent in the previous two sessions.  Bullion surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing.  Silver futures for July delivery jumped 1.2 percent to
$28.949 an ounce in New York, gaining for the second straight
day.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery rose 0.4 percent to $1,454.40 an ounce. Palladium
futures for September delivery slipped 0.1 percent to $624.25 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
