Marcopolo SA (POMO4) , a Brazilian truck and
bus bodies manufacturer, rose to a one-week high after saying it
will build a 35 million-real ($17 million) plant in the state of
Espirito Santo.  Shares gained 1.2 percent to 9.02 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo. The benchmark Bovespa index advanced 1.9 percent.  Marcopolo signed an agreement with the state government to
open a new plant in the Sao Mateus municipality. The facility
will focus on the Volare minibus and is scheduled to open in the
second quarter of 2013, the company said in a regulatory filing
after the market closed yesterday.  “It is in line with the company’s strategy to diversify
operations geographically,” analyst Renata Faber at Banco Itau
BBA wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday. “The production
of these minibuses in two different plants reduces the company’s
operational risks, and the current plant is already producing at
near full capacity.”  Volare currently is produced at Marcopolo’s plant in Caxias
do Sul in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, according to the
company’s website.  Marcopolo rose 27 percent this year, while the Bovespa fell
3 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
