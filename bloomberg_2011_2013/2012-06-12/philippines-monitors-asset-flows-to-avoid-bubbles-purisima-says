Philippine policy makers are
examining foreign capital inflows and investment in real estate
to dodge excessive increases in currency valuation and housing
prices, according to Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima.  “We are monitoring carefully the situation to make sure we
don’t create problems down the road for us in terms of asset
bubbles,” Purisima said in an interview yesterday at Bloomberg
headquarters in  New York . “We believe we are very far from the
situation.”  The peso has rallied 2 percent versus the dollar this year,
the best performer among the most-traded Asian currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Remittances from overseas workers and outsourcing from
multinational companies, rather than speculators, are the main
reasons to support the peso, according to Purisima, who is
meeting with investors and credit-rating companies in the U.S.  The government is trying to direct foreign capital into
infrastructure investment to help boost growth, he said.  The  Philippine economy  expanded 6.4 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2010, as
President  Benigno Aquino  boosted  government spending  to counter
faltering global demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
