Tereos Internacional SA (TERI3) ,  Brazil ’s
third-largest sugar and ethanol producer by market value, fell
to a five-month low after reporting a 27 percent drop in profit
for the fiscal year that ended March 31.  Shares declined 0.7 percent to 2.68 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the lowest since Jan. 16. The benchmark Bovespa index
rose 1.9 percent.  Tereos’s net income retreated to 137 million reais in 2012
from 188 million reais in 2011, the company said in a regulatory
filing after the market closed yesterday. Revenue rose 21
percent, to 6.9 billion reais.  The results were “in line with our estimates and the
market consensus,” Fator Corretora analysts Rodrigo Fernandes
and Hering Shen wrote in a note to clients dated today. “The
decline in agricultural productivity affected [subsidiary]
Guarani’s operating result negatively although this was partly
offset by the rise in average sugar and ethanol prices.”  Tereos fell 1.5 percent this year, while the Bovespa lost 3
percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
