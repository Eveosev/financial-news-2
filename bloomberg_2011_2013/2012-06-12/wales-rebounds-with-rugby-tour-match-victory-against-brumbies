Wales  rebounded from losing its
rugby Test series opener to Australia by beating the ACT
Brumbies 25-15 in a midweek tour match.  James Hook, Justin Tipuric and Alun Wyn Jones ran in tries
last night as Six Nations winner Wales followed its 27-19 loss
to the Wallabies on June 9 in Brisbane by defeating the two-time
Super Rugby champions in Canberra. Lock Luke Charteris was the
only Welsh player to be retained in the starting lineup.  The Test series resumes June 16 in Melbourne before
concluding a week later in Sydney. This year marks a return to
best-of-three contests as rugby administrators seek to make
matches more meaningful in the June international period, during
which touring northern hemisphere teams have typically sent
under strength squads to the southern hemisphere.  Australia  coach Robbie Deans yesterday named an unchanged
starting lineup for the second Test as the Wallabies seek a
series-clinching victory.  -- With assistance from Dan Baynes in Sydney. Editor:  James Cone .  To contact the reporter on this story:
