The pound climbed to the strongest
this month against the euro after  Fitch Ratings  said AAA nations
in the currency bloc are at risk of downgrades, boosting demand
for the perceived safety of U.K. assets.  Sterling advanced for a second day versus the dollar after
a U.K. report showed an index of  house prices  improved in May
more than economists forecast. Gilts dropped for a second day as
bidding declined at a 4.75 billion-pound ($7.38 billion) sale of
five-year notes. Spanish  10-year yields  rose to a euro-era
record after Fitch said the nation will “significantly’ miss
its budget deficit targets.  “The safe-haven angle is pushing the pound higher versus
the euro,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales
at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “The pound is deemed
as a secure place in  Europe  to park cash. Meanwhile, the euro is
suffering again given  Spain ’s 10-year yields trading at record
highs.”  The pound rose 0.5 percent to 80.21 per euro at 4:19 p.m.
London time after climbing to 80.12 pence, the strongest level
since May 31. Sterling appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.5550, and
gained 0.5 percent to 123.62 yen.  The U.K. currency gained for a second day versus the euro
after Fitch Managing Director Ed Parker said ratings in the
currency bloc were under “strong downward pressure.”  If there’s “no light at the end of the tunnel soon,” the
risk of a breakup of the 17-member euro area will rise, he said
in Oslo. “Last minute” solutions are raising the cost of
managing the crisis, he said.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield jumped to 6.834 percent, the
highest since the euro was introduced in 1999.  House Prices  The pound was also boosted after the  Royal Institution  of
Chartered Surveyors said its house-price index rose to minus 16
in May from minus 19 in April. A reading below zero means more
surveyors saw price drops than gains. A separate report showed
U.K. factory output fell more in April than economists forecast.  Gilts fell after the Debt Management Office said today’s
five-year auction attracted bids for 1.28 times the amount on
offer, down from 1.37 at a sale in April. The government will
sell 1.5 billion pounds of bonds maturing in 2060 on June 14.  The yield on the five-year gilt rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 0.78 percent after increasing four
basis points yesterday. The 1.75 percent note maturing in
January 2017 dropped 0.19, or 1.9 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 104.385.  ‘More Supply’  “There are two gilt auctions this week and that is helping
to push yields higher as the market prepares room for more
supply,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in  London .  The  10-year bond yield  gained three basis points to 1.68
percent, and the 30-year yield also increased three basis points
to 3.05 percent.  The Debt Management Office plans to sell 12.5 billion
pounds of gilts this month and another 17.6 billion pounds next
month, according to estimates from Barclays Plc.  Gilts have returned 2.5 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Treasuries gained 1.9 percent, and
German bunds advanced 3.9 percent.  Sterling has gained 2 percent in 2012, the second-best
performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar was the best,
gaining 2.1 percent, and the euro fell 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
