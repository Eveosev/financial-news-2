Minnesota Vikings wide receiver
Jerome Simpson was suspended without pay for the first three
games of the  National Football League ’s regular season for
violating the league’s substance abuse policy.  Simpson, 26, signed with the Vikings as a free agent in
April after playing for the  Cincinnati Bengals  last season and
catching 50 passes for 725 yards and four touchdowns.  Just before he signed with the Vikings, Simpson received a
15-day jail sentence and three years’ probation after pleading
guilty to a felony drug charge in Kentucky. He faced a charge of
marijuana trafficking after investigators found 2 1/2 pounds of
the drug shipped to his Kentucky home in September 2011.  Simpson can participate in all offseason and preseason
practices and games, the NFL said in an e-mailed statement.
After sitting out regular-season games against Jacksonville,
Indianapolis and San Francisco, he’ll be eligible to return to
the Vikings’ active roster on Sept. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
