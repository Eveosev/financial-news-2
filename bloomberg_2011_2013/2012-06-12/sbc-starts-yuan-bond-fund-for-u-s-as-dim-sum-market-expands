HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest
bank, has started a fixed income fund for U.S. investors that
will invest in bonds sold in China’s currency in Hong Kong.  The HSBC RMB Fixed Income Fund will buy securities
denominated in the Chinese currency, also known as the  renminbi ,
the London-based bank said in a statement on Business Wire
today. It will be managed by HSBC Global Asset Management’s Hong
Kong-based fixed-income team, it said.  “The investment case for the offshore renminbi bond market
is compelling, given competitive yields and the long-term
potential for the renminbi currency to appreciate,” Cecilia Chan, who has managed Asian fixed income assets for 18 years at
HSBC, said in the statement. “The internationalization of the
renminbi will continue to be an important theme for many years
to come.”  China, which has allowed Hong Kong residents to hold  yuan 
in bank accounts since 2004, began to open the currency to other
uses outside of its borders in 2009, with a program to allow
trade with Chinese companies to be paid for in yuan.  China ended its own peg to the U.S. dollar in July 2005,
saying it would manage the  exchange rate  against a basket of
currencies, and the yuan has strengthened 30 percent versus the
greenback in that time. Sales of yuan bonds in Hong Kong, known
as Dim Sum bonds, began in 2007.  There were 79 billion yuan of Dim Sum bonds sold this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared to 151 billion
yuan in 2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
