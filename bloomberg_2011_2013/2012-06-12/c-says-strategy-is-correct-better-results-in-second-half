HTC Corp. (2498) , the Taiwanese smartphone
maker that cut its revenue forecast twice in the past three
quarters, hopes to see better results in the second half as new
products boost momentum.  “The company’s direction and strategy is correct, we need
a bit more time,” President and Chief Executive Officer Peter Chou told investors at HTC’s annual shareholder meeting in
Taoyuan today.  HTC’s shares have  fallen  15 percent to the lowest in two
years since its June 6 announcement that revenue this quarter
will miss an earlier forecast by 13 percent amid stronger
competition in Europe and customs delays in the U.S. A change of
strategy enacted last year to cut the number of models and
strengthen relationships with distributors will pay off while
it’s also expanding in new markets, Chou said today.  “ Emerging markets  such as India and China are very good
opportunities for us as we are planning to release models that
are suited to those who are using a smartphone for the first
time,” he said.  The  stock  dropped 0.6 percent to NT$345 at the close of
trade in Taipei. HTC has declined 31 percent this year after
dropping 42 percent in 2011.  Chairwoman  Cher Wang , once Taiwan’s richest woman, pledged
today to boost  shareholder value  by releasing more competitive
and innovative products. The company’s market value has declined
NT$52 billion ($1.7 billion) in the past four days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We have faced and overcome bigger challenges, and we will
try even harder,” Wang said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
