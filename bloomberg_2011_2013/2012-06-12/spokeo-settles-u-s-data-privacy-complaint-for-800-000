Spokeo Inc., a data broker that
compiles dossiers on consumers, agreed to pay $800,000 to settle
allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it sold
personal information in violation of the law.  From 2008 to 2010, Spokeo sold profiles on millions of
consumers to human resources departments and companies that do
background screening and recruiting without making sure the
information would be used only for legally permissible reasons,
the FTC said today in a statement on its website.  Spokeo, a Pasadena, California-based search engine, also
failed to make sure the information was accurate or tell its
clients they are required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act
to notify anyone against whom they take adverse action based on
the reports.  “This is the first commission case to address the sale of
Internet and social media data in the employment screening
context,” the FTC said in the statement.  The FTC also alleged that Spokeo deceptively posted
endorsements of its service on news and technology websites and
blogs, portraying those endorsements as independent when they
were created by Spokeo’s own employees.  Under the settlement, Spokeo is also barred from future
violations and from making misrepresentations about its
endorsements.  Spokeo said today on its website that it doesn’t create
its own content, doesn’t have access to consumers’ financial
information and doesn’t offer consumer reports.  “We have made changes to our site and our internal
business practices in order to ensure we don’t infringe upon the
FCRA’s important consumer protections,” Spokeo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
