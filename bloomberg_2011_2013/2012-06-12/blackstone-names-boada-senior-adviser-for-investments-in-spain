Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world’s
largest private-equity firm, named Claudio Boada, a former head
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s Spanish and Portuguese
businesses, as a senior adviser to boost investments in euro
crisis-stricken Spain and  Portugal .  Boada, based in  Madrid , is joining the private-equity and
real estate team and will help originate transactions in the
Iberian region, the New York-based firm said in a statement
today. Boada is also chairman of cement maker Holcim Espana SA
and sits on the European advisory board of HSBC Holdings Plc.  “We see substantial long-term opportunities in Spain to
invest and create value for our limited partners, as
demonstrated last year by Blackstone’s investment in Mivisa, the
metal packaging manufacturer,” Joseph Baratta, head of
Blackstone’s European private-equity operations, said in the
statement.  Buyout firms are seeing investment opportunities in  Spain 
just as the country became the euro region’s fourth nation to
seek European Union assistance since the start of the debt
crisis with a request of as much as 100 billion euros ($125
billion) to recapitalize its banks. They are looking to buy
assets at a discount from Spanish lenders willing to sell real
estate loans and property to boost regulatory capital.  “Given Spain’s need to recapitalize its banking sector, we
believe that Claudio will be instrumental in establishing joint
ventures and transactions between Blackstone and Spanish banks
to bring in much needed expertise and capital into the
country,” Chad Pike, co-head of European real estate at
Blackstone, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
