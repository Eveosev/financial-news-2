Lanco Infratech Ltd. (LANCI) , the second-
largest non-state utility in India, is complying with rules on
ownership of solar plants, the government said after a report on
the company’s shareholdings prompted a ministry investigation.  “We’ve completed the inquiry,” Tarun Kapoor, the joint
secretary at the Ministry of New and  Renewable Energy , said by
phone. “As of now their shareholdings are in compliance.”  Lanco owned convertible preferred shares in companies that
won national auctions to build solar projects and the equities
can be switched into common stock, Kapoor said. The utility has
cut some of the holdings so it will own less than 50 percent of
the companies should the shares be converted, he said. Lanco
didn’t respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking comment.  The companies that issued the convertibles have established
businesses and funds other than those from Lanco, Kapoor said.  The Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based
environmental campaign group, said in a report in February that
Lanco created companies to hold projects with 235 megawatts of
capacity, or about 40 percent of the generation awarded by the
government in  India ’s first national solar auction. The maximum
for any one company, under the auction rules, is 105 megawatts.  Lanco rose 1.7 percent to 13.88 rupees by 1:07 p.m. in
Mumbai, paring its decline in the past year to 55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
