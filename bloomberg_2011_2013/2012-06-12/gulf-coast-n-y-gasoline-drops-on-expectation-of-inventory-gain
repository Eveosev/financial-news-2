Gasoline in the U.S.  Gulf Coast  and
 New York  fell as analysts expect an increase of inventories of
the motor fuel.  Total gasoline stocks in the U.S. may rise 1.4 million
barrels to 204.9 million, according to the median of 12 analysts
polled in a Bloomberg survey. It would be the second increase in
17 weeks, based on Energy Department data.  The premium for reformulated gasoline in the Gulf Coast
fell 1 cent to 5.25 cents a gallon versus futures traded on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:56 a.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery dropped 1.5 cents to
$2.7041 a gallon.  Motiva Enterprises LLCâ€™s Port Arthur refinery in Texas is
assessing repairs to its new 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit, a
person with knowledge of operations said yesterday. A startup
was abandoned over the weekend after the crude unit developed
leaks, cracks in pipes, and a fire in a heater, according to the
person.  Delek U.S. Holdings Inc. reported a mechanical malfunction
in the sulfur recovery unit at its Tyler,  Texas , refinery,
according to a filing with state regulators yesterday.  The differential for the same fuel in New York Harbor
decreased 0.25 cent to 9.63 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
