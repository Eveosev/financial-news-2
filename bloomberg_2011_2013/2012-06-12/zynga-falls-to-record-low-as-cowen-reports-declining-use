Zynga Inc., the biggest maker of
games played on  Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s social-networking site, fell to
a record low after analysts at Cowen & Co. said usage declined
last month as players switched to mobile devices.  Shares of San Francisco-based Zynga decreased 10 percent to
$4.98 at the close in New York, the lowest price since the
company sold shares at $10 apiece in an initial public offering
in December. Through yesterday, the stock had dropped 41 percent
this year.  Daily active use for Zynga’s social gaming dropped 8.2
percent in May, said  Doug Creutz , an analyst at Cowen in  San
Francisco , in a report today. Facebook accounts for most of
sales and takes a cut of virtual goods sold in Zynga games, such
as crops and tractor equipment in “Farmville.” While Zynga is
the dominant provider of games on Facebook, it faces
significantly more competition on smartphones and tablets.  “Consumer preferences may be switching decisively to
mobile games given that quality is similar, if not better, and
mobile games have the added advantage of being playable at any
time, anywhere,” said Creutz, who has a neutral rating on
Zynga’s  shares (ZNGA)  and a price estimate of $5.55. “Mobile devices
may be siphoning off an accelerating number of gamers from
Facebook.”  Facebook, based in  Menlo Park , California, has said its
revenue may be negatively affected by users accessing the site
on mobile devices rather than personal computers, since the
company’s ability to make money off mobile users is unproven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
