Canadian beef producers can resume
shipments to  Peru  effective immediately ending a ban imposed
because of an outbreak of mad cow disease, the Canadian
Agriculture Ministry said.  Exporters can ship Canadian bone-in beef under 30 months of
age, boneless beef of all ages, and offal, Agriculture and Agri-
Food Canada said today in an e-mailed statement. This is the
first time since 2003 that the country’s beef can be shipped to
Peru after it was closed because of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, a brain-wasting disease. Canada Beef Inc.
estimates that this market could be worth up to C$2 million
($1.94 million) annually for the country’s producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
