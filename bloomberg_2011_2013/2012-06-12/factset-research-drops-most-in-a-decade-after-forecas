FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS) , a
provider of financial data, dropped the most in more than a
decade after it forecast fourth-quarter revenue and profit that
trailed analysts’ estimates, citing the “volatile” economy.  FactSet Research tumbled 13 percent to $91.70 at the close
in New York, the biggest one-day retreat since Sept. 17, 2001.
The shares have gained 5.1 percent this year.  Earnings excluding certain items will be as much as $1.17 a
share for the fiscal quarter ending Aug. 31, the Norwalk,
Connecticut-based company said in a statement today. That
compared with an average analyst estimate of $1.21, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue for the period will be as much as $208 million,
according to the statement. Analysts had projected an average of
$210.5 million.  FactSet Research competes with Bloomberg LP, the parent of
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
