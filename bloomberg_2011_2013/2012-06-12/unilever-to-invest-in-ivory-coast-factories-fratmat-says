Unilever Plc will invest 6 million
euros ($7.5 million) this year to improve its factories in  Ivory
Coast , Fraternite-Matin reported, citing David Mureithi,
managing director of Unileverâ€™s Ghanaian unit.  The consumer-goods group wants to bolster sales in northern
Ivory Coast, which was cut off from regular supply channels
because of a violent post-election conflict last year, the
Abidjan-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
