Pirelli & C. SpA, the world’s fifth-
largest tire maker, can survive the  European debt crisis  with
“good results” because only 40 percent of its sales are
generated in  Europe ,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported today,
citing Pirelli Chief Executive Officer Marco Tronchetti Provera.  Pirelli is focusing on an expansion outside Europe as well
as growth of premium tires to limit the effects of Europe’s debt
crisis, the German newspaper cited Provera as saying. Some 30
percent of the Italian company’s production is “flexible,”
Provera said, according to Financial Times Deutschland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
