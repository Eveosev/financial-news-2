Fitch Ratings, citing the potential
of loans at some lenders to deteriorate, cut its credit ratings
on 18 Spanish banks, including  Bankia SA (BKIA) , after its downgrade of
Spain last week.  Bankia’s long-term issuer default rating was cut to BBB
from BBB+ with a negative outlook, the ratings company said in
an e-mailed statement today.  CaixaBank (CABK)  SA was reduced to BBB
from A-, Banco Sabadell SA to BBB from BBB+ and  Banco Popular
Espanol SA (POP)  to BBB- from BBB, Fitch said.  Spain on June 9 sought a European bailout of as much as 100
billion euros ($125 billion) to support ailing lenders, the
fourth euro member to seek a rescue since the debt crisis
started almost three years ago.  Fitch, which estimates the capital needs of Spanish banks
at as much as 60 billion euros under a “base case” scenario,
said it had considered its sovereign downgrade for  Spain  on June
7 and also the potential for loans of certain banks to worsen in
taking today’s actions on the lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
