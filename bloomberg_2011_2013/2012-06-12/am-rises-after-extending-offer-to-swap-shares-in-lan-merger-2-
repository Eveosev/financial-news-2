Tam SA (TAMM4) ,  Brazil ’s biggest airline,
rose the most in eight months after extending an offer to swap
shares as part of its combination with  Chile ’s  Lan Airlines SA. (LAN)   Shares advanced 6.8 percent to 44.35 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the steepest one-day gain since Oct. 5. It was the
best performance on the benchmark Bovespa index, which gained
1.9 percent.  An offer to receive 0.9 Lan share for each Tam share closed
yesterday, with 94.4 percent of shares tendered, the two
airlines said in regulatory filings today. Because acceptances
fell short of a 95 percent threshold that allows Tam to buy back
leftover shares compulsorily, the offer was extended 10 days and
results will be registered June 22 at 10 a.m.  Sao Paulo  time,
according to the filings.  “The market expects the percentage to meet requirements in
this new deadline, and share prices advancing today show that
the portion of investors potentially interested in accepting the
offer is growing,” Rodolfo Amstalden, an analyst at Empiricus
Research, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Tam will be delisted if owners of at least two-thirds of
the stock from minority holders accept the offer. Tam holders
will receive depositary shares in Latam Airlines Group SA, the
company formed by the merger, which would be the world’s most
valuable carrier with a leading position in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
