First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
largest maker of thin-film solar panels, will delay the close of
a German plant until the end of this year to meet unexpected
strong demand in  Europe .  The company is increasing production now at its factory in
Frankfurt an der Oder, Germany, and will scale back in the
fourth quarter, Brandon Mitchener, a spokesman for Tempe,
Arizona-based First Solar, said today.  The company had planned to shutter the plant in October as
part of a global restructuring that also includes firing 30
percent of its staff. Waning government support for solar energy
in Europe is slowing demand for panels, and at least four German
solar manufacturers including  Q-Cells SE (QCE) , once the biggest cell
maker, filed for insolvency since December.  First Solar “is returning to a full work schedule” at the
factory, Mitchener said today in an e-mail. The company expects
to operate the plant “near full production capacity through
October, and then begin to wind down production and close the
facility by year-end.”  The short-term increase is “due to unexpected order intake
in Europe” while the “long-term trend remains downward” for
the region, Mitchener said in an interview.  First Solar shares rose 21 percent to $14.95 at the close
in New York, the biggest gain since April 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
