Ghana ’s three-month borrowing  costs 
are set to rise to the highest in more than three years by
December as the central bank continues measures to bolster the
slumping cedi, according to Databank Financial Services Ltd.  The benchmark 91-day Treasury bill yield may climb to 25
percent, Daniel Ogbarmey Tetteh, head of asset management at
Databank, based in Accra, said in an interview yesterday. That
would be the highest since Nov. 20, 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate declined for the first time
since Jan. 30 at the June 8 auction, dropping 47 basis points,
or 0.47 percentage point, to 20.2 percent.  “It will inch up but I expect it to stabilize around the
mid-20s,” Tetteh said. The  Bank of Ghana  will use the higher
yield as an attempt to stop the depreciation in the local
currency, he said.  The central bank is looking to reduce the amount of cedis
in the market to shore up the currency, which has slipped almost
15 percent this year against the dollar, the worst performer in
 Africa  after the Malawian kwacha. The cedi declined 1.2 percent
to 1.9255 per dollar by 4:50 p.m. in Accra, the weakest since at
least June 1993 when Bloomberg began compiling the data.  The depreciation of the cedi drove  inflation  to 9.1 percent
in April, a 14-month high and above the bank’s 2012 target of
8.5 percent. The rate probably accelerated to 9.3 percent in
May, Nii Ampa-Sowa, head of research at Databank, said in an e-
mailed note. The Ghana Statistical Service will announce the
inflation rate tomorrow at 10 a.m.  The central bank increased its policy interest rate for the
second consecutive time by 100 basis points to 14.5 percent on
April 13. Seven of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect
the bank to increase the rate by another 100 basis points when
the Monetary Policy Committee announces its decision tomorrow at
about 11 a.m.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
