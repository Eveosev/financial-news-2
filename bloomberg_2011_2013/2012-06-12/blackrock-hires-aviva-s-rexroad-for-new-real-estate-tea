BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest
money manager, hired Sherry Rexroad from Aviva Investors to
build and run a real estate investment team.  Rexroad was named chief investment officer of BlackRock’s
new global real estate securities team, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. She was most recently senior
portfolio manager of real estate investment trusts for the
Americas at Aviva. Rexroad reports to Mark Howard-Johnson,
global head of BlackRock’s real estate securities group.  “My first priorities will be to attract a strong bench of
talent and to deliver a compelling product offering to our
clients,” Rexroad said in the statement.  Last year, BlackRock expanded its alternatives division,
which manages  hedge funds , real estate funds and private-equity
strategies. The new real estate securities platform will look
for trends and investment opportunities in real estate
securities using an intense fundamental approach, BlackRock said
in the statement.  The company manages $3.68 trillion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
