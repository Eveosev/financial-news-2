Daruma Corporate Finance , an
Istanbul-based  investment adviser , and Madrid-based investment
bank and asset manager N+1 International set up a partnership to
raise as much as 1 billion euros ($1.25 billion) of private
equity funds.  N+1, which has about 3.1 billion euros of assets under
management, and Daruma will use the funds to invest in Turkish
assets and to provide financing for Turkish and European mid-
segment companies, Okan Altug, managing partner at Daruma
Corporate, said at a news conference in Istanbul today.  Last year, 46 out of a total of 241 mergers and
acquisitions in Turkey were made by private equity firms,
Deloitte & Touche LLP said in a report in January. The industry
is expanding after Turkey’s economy grew 8.5 percent in 2011,
the most after  China  among the Group of 20 industrialized
nations, attracting finance companies and banks including
Russia’s  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  and  Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. (8411)  of  Japan  to
Turkey this year.  “Our main target is to provide financing, including
mezzanine finance, for about 1,500 top medium and large
companies in Turkey as well as mid-segment companies in
 Europe ,” Altug said. “We will also provide advisory services
for mergers and acquisitions valued between 25 million euros and
250 million euros.”  Raising Funds  N+1 and Daruma Corporate plan to raise between 250 million
euros and 400 million euros for energy investments, according to
a statement handed to reporters today. They will also add a
mezzanine fund of 200 million euros to 300 million euros this
year and a commercial real estate fund of 200 million euros to
300 million euros in 2013, it said. “These will be close end
funds,” Altug said.  The partnership, named N+1 Daruma, was created after Daruma
Corporate sold a 20 percent stake to N+1 International and
bought 5.25 percent of N+1 International in a so-called equity
swap, Altug said.  “Mezzanine finance will be booming in  Turkey  in coming
years and there is big appetite for international investors for
this,” said Santiago Eguidazu Mayor, board member of the N+1
Daruma and founder of N+1, at the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
