Shinsei Bank Ltd. (8303) ’s former Tokyo
headquarters will be up for final bidding on June 19, two people
familiar with the sale said today.  The bidding is being arranged by Orix Asset Management &
Loan Services Corp., a unit of  Orix Corp. (8591) , and Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co., according to the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential. An initial
bid of 40 billion yen ($503 million) closed on May 31, Reuters
reported earlier today, citing unidentified people who who knew
about the deal.  Michio Nagano, a spokesman at Mizuho Trust & Banking,
declined to comment when reached today by telephone. A call to
Orix Asset Management & Loan Services in  Tokyo  after normal
business hours wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
