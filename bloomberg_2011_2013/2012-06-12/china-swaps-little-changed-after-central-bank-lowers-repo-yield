China ’s one-year  interest-rate swaps 
were little changed after yesterday’s biggest rally this year as
the central bank lowered yields on 28-day  repurchase agreements 
for the first time since 2008.  The People’s Bank of China sold 30 billion yuan ($4.7
billion) of the contracts at 2.75 percent, according to a
statement posted on its website. The yield had been unchanged at
2.8 percent since July. Official reports in the past few days
showed exports beat analysts’ forecasts and new loans rose,
while factory-output growth fell short of estimates.  “It’s an easing signal,” said  Ju Wang , a Barclays Capital
strategist in  Singapore . “The lower repo, while not much, still
suggests the PBOC’s willingness to yield to market-rate levels
and avoid tight liquidity. We may see a bigger adjustment in the
91-day repo rate” later in the week, he said.  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost needed to receive
the seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis point to 2.50
percent as of 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It touched 2.30 percent on June 8, the lowest
level since October 2010.  China needs to further cut banks’ reserve requirements,
boost fiscal spending and start project investment to sustain
credit demand, according to a research report from HSBC Holdings
Plc economists Sun Junwei and Qu Hongbin issued yesterday.  Property Curbs  The monetary authority reduced its one-year lending and
deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 6.31 percent
and 3.25 percent, respectively, on June 8. The central bank also
loosened controls on banks’ ability to set lending and deposit
rates.  Local-currency loans climbed to 793.2 billion yuan in May,
compared with the 700 billion  yuan  median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 29 economists and 681.8 billion yuan in
April.  China’s economy  expanded 8.1 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, the slowest pace in almost three years.  China’s benchmark money-market rate rose. The  seven-day
repurchase rate , a gauge of funding availability in the
financial system, increased 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage
point, to 2.55 percent in Shanghai, according to a weighted
average compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. The
yield on 3.51 percent government bonds due February 2022 rose
two basis points to 3.37 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
