Prince Nayef, Saudi Arabia’s
interior minister and crown prince, met with a number of the
kingdom’s princes and officials at his residence in Geneva, the
official  Saudi Press Agency  reported late yesterday.  Nayef left the kingdom for scheduled medical tests and a
private holiday, the  Royal Court  said on May 26, without
specifying where he was going. The prince also went to
Cleveland, Ohio in March for medical tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
