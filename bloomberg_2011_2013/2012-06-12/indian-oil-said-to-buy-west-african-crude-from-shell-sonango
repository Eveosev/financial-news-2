Indian Oil Corp. bought at least 3
million barrels of West African crudes for loading in August
from  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Sonangol Holdings via a tender,
four traders who participate in the market said.  The nationâ€™s largest refiner purchased 1 million barrels
each of Nigerian Agbami and Angolan Hungo grades from Shell and
1 million barrels of Angolan Kissanje crude from Sonangol,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
the information is confidential.  To contact the reporters on this story:
