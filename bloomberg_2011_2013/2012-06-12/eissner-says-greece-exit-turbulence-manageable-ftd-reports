Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s head of
global investment banking Christian Meissner said it’s “pretty
likely” that  Greece  will leave the euro or quit the European
Union altogether if anti-euro parties win Sunday’s elections in
Greece,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing Meissner.  Still, the “significant turbulence” that “doubtlessly”
will come if Greece leaves the euro will be “manageable,”
Meissner said, according to the German newspaper. The European
debt crisis that has engulfed Spain will not necessarily spread
to Italy as the country has more fiscal leeway than Spain,
Financial Times Deutschland cited Meissner as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
