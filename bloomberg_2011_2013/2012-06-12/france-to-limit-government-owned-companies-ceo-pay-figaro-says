French Finance Minister  Pierre
Moscovici  tomorrow will present proposed rules for the
remuneration of corporate officers in companies in which the
government holds a majority stake, limiting them to 20 times the
pay of the lowest-paid employees,  Le Figaro  reported.  In enterprises in which the state holds a minority stake,
the government will instruct its representatives on the boards
of directors to propose the same limitations on CEOsâ€™ pay, the
newspaper said, citing information it said it has obtained.  The multiple for the salaries of executives in state-
controlled enterprises will be based on the average income
across the 15 companies in which the government is the majority
holder, Le Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
