Australia and  Japan  tied 1-1
yesterday in Asia’s final group qualifying stage for the 2014
 World Cup , while  South Korea  beat Lebanon 3-0.  Yuzo Kurihara put Japan ahead after 65 minutes in the
matchup of Asia’s two highest-ranked teams at Brisbane’s Suncorp
Stadium, with Luke Wilkshire replying five minutes later as
Australia was awarded a penalty kick.  Both teams finished the game with 10 men, Mark Milligan and
Kurihara dismissed after receiving their second yellow cards.  Asian champion Japan  tops Group B  with seven points as it
seeks for a fifth straight appearance at soccer’s four-yearly
championship. Iraq, Australia and Oman all have two points, with
Jordan on one. South Korea heads Group A with six points, two
ahead of Iran and Qatar. Uzbekistan and Lebanon have one point
each.  Iraq tied 1-1 against Oman yesterday, and the match between
Iran and Qatar was scoreless.  Asia’s 10 remaining teams have a yearlong phase of home-
and-away games, with the winners and runners-up from each group
taking the region’s four direct berths at the 2014 World Cup in
Brazil. The third-place teams will playoff for the right to take
on South America’s fifth-ranked nation for another spot.  The next round of matches is scheduled for Sept. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
