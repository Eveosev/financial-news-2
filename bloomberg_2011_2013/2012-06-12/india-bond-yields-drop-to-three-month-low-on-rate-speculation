India ’s benchmark bonds rose,
pushing yields to a three-month low, on speculation the central
bank will cut borrowing  costs  next week to revive a slowing
economy.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower the repurchase rate by
25 basis points to 7.75 percent on June 18, according to 11 of
15 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Two predicted the central
bank will leave the rate unchanged and the rest forecast a 50
basis point reduction. Gross domestic product  rose  5.3 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier, the least in nine
years, official data showed on May 31.  “Bond investors are bullish, driven by rate-cut
expectations,” J. Moses Harding, the Mumbai-based executive
vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd., wrote in a note to
clients. “Overall, it’s good to stay invested in bonds into the
monetary-policy meeting.”  The yield on the government’s 8.79 percent bonds due
November 2021 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
8.32 percent as of 9:31 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. That was the lowest level since March 14.  The central bank will cut the  repurchase  rate and lenders’
reserve requirements by 50 basis points each, Harding predicted.  The monetary authority last reduced the repo rate by 50
basis points to 8 percent in April after raising it 13 times
between March 2010 and October 2011. The reserve  ratio  has been
cut by 125 basis points this year to 4.75 percent.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell five basis
points to 7.54 percent, the lowest level since August, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
