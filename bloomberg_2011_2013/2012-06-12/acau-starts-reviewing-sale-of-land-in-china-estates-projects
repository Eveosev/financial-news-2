Macau is reviewing land concessions
linked to Ao Man-long, the former secretary of transportation
and public works convicted of corruption, on which  Chinese
Estates Holdings Ltd. (127)  is building a project.  The government doesn’t rule out nullifying the orders
granting the transfer of five land plots involved in an unlawful
act, it said in a statement.  Chinese Estates Holdings, controlled by billionaire Joseph
Lau, said on June 7 it can appeal any decision by Macau
authorities to invalidate a land transfer. Lau was named in
April in the corruption trial of Ao in relation to land being
developed by Chinese Estates.  Calls to Chinese Estates seeking comment weren’t answered
outside normal office hours. Lau has denied allegations that
emerged in Macau court proceedings that he or his company may
have given bribes to Ao, according to an April 17 statement by
Chinese Estates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
