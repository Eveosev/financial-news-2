Secretariat’s winning time in the
1973  Preakness Stakes  will be reviewed using modern video
technology to determine if the horse set a record in all three
races as he swept the Triple Crown.  The Maryland Racing Commission said it will consider a
request by Secretariat’s owner,  Penny Chenery , and Maryland
Jockey Club President Thomas Chuckas to investigate the official
timing of the race. The commission holds its next meeting on
June 19 at Laurel Park.  “During the last 40 years, video technology has been
accepted in other professional sports as a supportive mechanism
for officials to ensure fairness and accuracy in their
decisions,” Chuckas said in a statement. “It is important for
horse racing and the record books to confirm the correct time in
this historical race.”  Secretariat is one of 11 thoroughbreds to win horse
racing’s Triple Crown, with victories in the  Kentucky Derby ,
Preakness and Belmont Stakes in 1973. The Preakness is the only
one of the races in which Secretariat didn’t set a record.  The electronic timer used at Baltimore’s Pimlico Race
Course recorded Secretariat’s win in 1 minute, 55 seconds, while
two independent clockers from the Daily Racing Form each hand-
timed the race at 1:53 2/5. The official time was later changed
to 1:54 2/5 -- the time reported by Pimlico’s official hand
clocker -- because of “extenuating circumstances” with the
electronic timer’s recording, the commission said.  Time Discrepancies  The Daily Racing Form still recognizes Secretariat’s time
for the 1 3/16-mile distance as 1:53 2/5, which would have
broken Canonero II’s then-record of 1:54 set at the 1971
Preakness. The Preakness’s current official record time of 1:53
2/5 was later set by Tank’s Prospect in 1985 and matched by
Louis Quatorze in 1997 and Curlin in 2007.  “For me, revisiting this dispute on a new day is a matter
of resolution -- for historians, for sportswriters and for
racing fans,” Chenery said. “Their voices are supported by
sound evidence, and they deserve to be heard.”  Secretariat won the  Kentucky  Derby in 1:59.4, setting a
track record for the 1 1/4-mile distance at Churchill Downs in
Louisville, Kentucky, and is one of only two horses to run the
race in less than two minutes. He won the 1 1/2-mile Belmont
Stakes at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, by 31 lengths in
2:24, both records that still stand.  Horse racing hasn’t had a Triple Crown winner since 1978,
when Affirmed won all three races. I’ll Have Another won the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness this year before being pulled out
of the Belmont the day before the June 9 race because of
tendinitis in his left front leg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
