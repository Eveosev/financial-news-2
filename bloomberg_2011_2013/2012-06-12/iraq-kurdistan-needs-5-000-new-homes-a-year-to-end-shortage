Iraq’s Kurdistan region needs to
spend 200 billion dinars ($172 million) a year on homebuilding
to resolve a residential shortage over the next decade,
according to an adviser to the housing ministry.  “We are capable of resolving the housing crisis in the
coming 10 years through building 5,000 units a year,” Ammar al-
Najjar said in an interview with Bloomberg today. “We’ll need
200 billion dinars a year to implement this plan.”  The ministry of housing and reconstruction is in the
process of awarding contracts with a value of 250 billion
dinars, al-Najjar said on the sidelines of an economic
conference in Erbil, northern Kurdistan. Construction is
expected to begin by the end of this year. The ministry awarded
contracts for 1,500 homes with a value of 50 billion dinars last
year, he said.  Najjar said the Kurdish regional government has resolved 60
percent of the region’s housing needs.  To contact the reporter on this story: Khalid al-Ansary in
