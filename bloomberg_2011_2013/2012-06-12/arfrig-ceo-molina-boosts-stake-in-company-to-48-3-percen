Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) ’s founder and
Chief Executive Officer Marcos Antonio Molina raised his  stake 
in the company after a 33 percent stock slump in the past year.  Molina increased his stake to 48.3 percent in May from 47.6
percent a month ago, according to a regulatory filing late
yesterday. He bought 2.28 million shares and spent about 21.4
million reais ($10.4 million) based on yesterday’s closing
price, the Sao Paulo-based beef producer said.  Molina held 43.5 percent of the company a year ago,
according to previous Brazil regulatory filings.  Marfrig fell 2.3 percent yesterday to close at 9.38 reais
in  Sao Paulo . The stock declined 33 percent in the past year,
more than twice as much the 14 percent slide in  Brazil ’s
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
