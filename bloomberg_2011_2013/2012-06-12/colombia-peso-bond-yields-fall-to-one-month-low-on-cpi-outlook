Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds held
at a one-month low on bets slowing global growth will curb
inflation in the South American nation.  The yield on the country’s 11.25 percent peso-denominated
debt due in October 2018 was little changed at 6.59 percent,
according to the central bank. That’s the lowest level on a
closing basis since May 8. Colombian markets were closed
yesterday for a holiday.  Colombia’s central bank cited cooling demand, the deepening
 European debt crisis  and cheaper oil in its decision to leave
the overnight lending rate unchanged last month at 5.25 percent,
according to June 8 minutes of the meeting. While keeping a
forecast for expansion this year of about 5 percent, policy
makers said the increased risks of a Greek exit from the euro
area and a “strong recession” in  Europe  may damp growth.  “Slower growth abroad will lead to less inflation
pressures locally and that’s what the market is betting on,”
said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage
Corredores Asociados.  Annual inflation accelerated to 3.44 percent last month
from 3.43 percent in April. Inflation will likely end this year
at about 3 percent, the midpoint of the monetary authority’s
target, central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe has said.  Colombia’s peso declined 0.1 percent to 1,777.75 per  U.S.
dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
