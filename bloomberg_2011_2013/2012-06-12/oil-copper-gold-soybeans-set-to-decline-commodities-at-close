The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.5 percent to 579.54 at 5:02 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials dropped
0.25 percent to 1428.671.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell a fourth day after Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali
al-Naimi  said OPEC may need a higher output quota and the U.S.
issued more exemptions from sanctions for buying  Iran ’s crude,
reducing the risk of supply disruption.  Oil for July delivery dropped as much as $1.63 to $81.07 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange
and was at $81.55 at 8:58 a.m.  London  time. The contract
declined 1.7 percent to $82.70 yesterday, the lowest close since
Oct. 6. Prices are down 17 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures declined in New York for the second day
to the lowest level since April on forecasts for cooler weather
that may reduce power-plant demand for the fuel.  Natural gas for July delivery fell 3 cents to $2.188 per
million Btu on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:59 a.m.
Singapore time. The fuel is at the lowest intraday price since
April 30. The contract yesterday dropped 3.5 percent to $2.218.  OIL PRODUCTS  Naphtha swaps for July fell $26.75, or 3.4 percent, to
$753.25 a ton, PVM data showed. Japan naphtha’s premium to
London-traded Brent crude futures fell $22.83 to $18.84 a ton,
PVM data showed.  Singapore gasoil swaps for July fell $2.45, or 2.2 percent,
to $110.30 a barrel, PVM data showed. The premium of gasoil to
Dubai crude was at $15.63 a barrel, up 3 cents.  Jet fuel traded at a premium of 90 cents a barrel to
gasoil, up 5 cents from yesterday. This spread, also known as
the regrade, is 20 cents higher than a week earlier.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined for the first time in three days, dropping
with other commodities, on concern that a bailout of Spanish
banks won’t stop the  European debt crisis  from spreading.  Immediate-delivery gold lost 0.4 percent to $1,590.80 an
ounce by 9:14 a.m. in London. August-delivery bullion declined
0.4 percent to $1,591.20 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  BASE METALS  Copper declined to near the lowest level in more than five
months on skepticism  Spain ’s 100 billion euro ($125 billion)
bailout will halt  Europe ’s debt crisis, curbing demand for
industrial metals.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans advanced as crop conditions in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower and exporter, deteriorated on dry
weather, potentially paring global supplies amid rising demand.  November-delivery soybeans increased as much as 0.7 percent
to $13.41 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, before trading
at $13.38 at 3:20 p.m. Singapore time.  July-delivery corn advanced as much as 1 percent to $5.98 a
bushel and last traded at $5.935. Wheat for July delivery gained
0.9 percent to $6.36 a bushel.  Soybean futures for November delivery, the contract with
the highest open interest, slid 0.1 percent to settle at
$13.3125 a bushel on the CBOT. The July contract declined 0.1
percent to $14.2475.  Rubber fell on concern that a bailout for Spain’s banks
won’t tame Europe’s debt crisis, reducing demand for industrial
commodities such as rubber and reversing gains that the
assistance had spurred.  The November-delivery contract dropped as much as 3.7
percent to 235.5 yen a kilogram ($2,971 a metric ton) and traded
at 238.8 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at noon local time.
The commodity advanced 2.9 percent on June 11.  Palm oil  dropped on speculation that output in  Malaysia ,
the second-largest grower after  Indonesia , will expand in the
coming months as yields improve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
