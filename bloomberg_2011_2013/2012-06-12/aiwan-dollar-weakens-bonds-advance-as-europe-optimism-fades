Taiwan’s dollar fell and  government
bonds  rallied as optimism that a 100 billion euro ($125 billion)
bailout of Spain’s banks would stem Europe’s debt crisis faded,
deterring risk-taking.  Spanish and Italian bond yields surged yesterday as
investors turned their attention to debt auctions in  Italy  this
week and elections on June 17 that may determine whether  Greece 
stays in the euro. Global funds sold $604 million more Taiwanese
shares than they bought this month, exchange data show.  “It’s clear that investors don’t believe this small step
will put an end to the crisis,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-
exchange trader at Union Bank of Taiwan in Taipei. “The  U.S.
dollar  will stay strong for a while.”  Taiwan ’s dollar fell 0.1 percent to NT$29.934 against its
U.S. counterpart as of 9:47 a.m. local time, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.990 earlier, the weakest
level since June 6. It could reach NT$30.500 in a month, Tong
forecast. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, was steady at 5.40 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 slipped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.18
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight
interbank lending rate  fell one basis point to 0.506 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
