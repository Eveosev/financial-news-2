Vietnam ’s government bonds fell,
snapping an eight-day advance, as a surge in the local money-
market rate sapped demand. The dong strengthened.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  increased 83 basis
points to 3.25 percent, the highest level since May 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate has gained
2.03 percentage points since June 6.  “ Interest rates  in the inter-bank market rose as some
banks are in need of cash, and that has brought up bond yields a
bit,” said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, the Ho Chi Minh City-based head
of fixed-income trading at  Asia Commercial Bank. (ACB)   The yield on the benchmark five-year bond advanced five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.50 percent,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The  dong  strengthened 0.3 percent to 20,930 per dollar as
of 3:07 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The central bank fixed the  reference rate  at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Andrew Janes, Sandy Hendry  To contact the reporter on this story:
