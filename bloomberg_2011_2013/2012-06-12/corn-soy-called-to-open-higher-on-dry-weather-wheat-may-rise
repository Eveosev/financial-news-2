What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 3 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade as dry weather curbs crop conditions,
Louise Gartner, the owner of Spectrum Commodities in
Beavercreek,  Ohio , said by telephone. Little or no rain fell in
parts of Iowa and Illinois, the biggest U.S. growers of corn and
soybeans, in the past week, the  National Weather Service  said in
a report today.  -- Soybean futures may open up 5 cents to 10 cents a bushel in
Chicago because of the dry weather in Iowa and Illinois the past
week, Gartner said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.1
cent to 0.2 cent higher per pound, and soybean-meal futures may
open $2 to $4 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as dry weather in Russia, expected to be the
fourth-biggest exporter of the grain, and Ukraine curbs crop
production, Gartner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
