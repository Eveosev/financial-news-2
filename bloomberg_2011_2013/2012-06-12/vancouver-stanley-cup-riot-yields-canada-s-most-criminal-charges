Vancouver  police said last year’s
 Stanley Cup  riot will lead to criminal charges against more than
300 people, a total that Chief Constable Jim Chu said is the
biggest from one incident in Canadian history.  Vancouver Canucks fans broke windows, looted shops and set
fires in the city following their team’s home loss to the  Boston
Bruins  in the decisive seventh game of last season’s National
Hockey League Stanley Cup Final on June 15, 2011.  Vancouver police said there have been 674 charges brought
against 225 suspected rioters, with the Integrated Riot
Investigation Team today delivering 82 more charges against 25
suspected rioters.  “For those rioters who think they’ve gotten away with it,
investigators are still conducting active investigations, and we
expect to recommend charges on a further 100 individuals in the
coming months,” Chu said in a statement. “By the time we are
done, we expect that we will exceed 300 persons charged with
over 900 criminal charges.”  Today’s announcement comes as the riot investigation team
prepares to be scaled back to 27 members from 70 on July 31.  The riot caused more than $3.4 million in damage, police
said, with 112 businesses hit and 122 vehicles damaged or
destroyed. There were also 52 identified assaults.  The investigation has stretched over a year as more than
5,500 hours of video were examined and processed in more than
100 formats, police said. By comparison, investigators had 100
hours of video to examine in one format, VHS, from the 1994
Vancouver riot that followed a Stanley Cup Final loss to the  New
York Rangers . A total of 50 forensic analysts representing 40
law enforcement agencies in  North America  and the U.K. have
worked on the 2011 investigation.  Police said that 83 percent of the alleged rioters were
from cities outside Vancouver.  “We believe this is the greatest number of people charged
with a crime arising from one incident in Canadian history,”
Chu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
