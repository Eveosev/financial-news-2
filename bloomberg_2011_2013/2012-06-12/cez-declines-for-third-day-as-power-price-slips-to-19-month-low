CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech utility,
retreated for a third day as the price of electricity dropped to
the lowest in almost 19 months.  The stock dropped 0.8 percent to 730 koruna by 10:12 a.m.
in  Prague , adding to a 2.3 percent decline in the previous two
sessions. Power for next-year delivery in Germany, where CEZ
exports part of its output, slid 0.3 percent to 47.80 euros per
megawatt-hour, the lowest since November 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
