Hungary’s  BUX (BUX)  equity index increased
0.6 percent to 16,889.03 by the end of trading in Budapest,
after falling 1.3 percent yesterday.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest oil refiner, climbed
1.2 percent to 16,500 forint, snapping a two-day drop. Today is
the last day shares trade with the right to a 454.54 forint
dividend from 2011 earnings.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , the country’s biggest lender,
rallied as much as 1.3 percent as lawmakers may vote within two
weeks on amendments to the central bank law that take into
account criticism from the  European Central Bank , Nepszabadsag
newspaper reported, citing politicians from the ruling Fidesz
party. Bringing the central bank law in line with ECB
requirements may unblock bailout talks with the International
Monetary Fund and the European Union.  The stock pared gains to less than 0.1 percent at 3,390
forint after Fitch Ratings cut its assessment of 18 of Spain’s
banks amid concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
