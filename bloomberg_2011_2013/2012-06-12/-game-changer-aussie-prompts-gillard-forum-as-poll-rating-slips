Australia must face up to the
challenges of a strong local currency, Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said as she hosts a two-day meeting with executives
aimed at boosting business support for her government.  “The high dollar is a huge game-changer,” Gillard wrote
in the Australian newspaper today. “The critical pillar of our
response” to structural changes in the economy “is being
prepared to get in and shape the change, not hide from it.”  Gillard and Treasurer  Wayne Swan  will host 130 business,
union and community leaders in Brisbane from today to discuss
the impact on the economy of a shift in global wealth to  Asia .
The local dollar has appreciated 73 percent in the past decade
against the U.S. currency, driven by Chinese and Indian demand
for the nation’s raw materials.  While the resources boom has made  Australia  one of the
fastest-growing economies in the developed world, Gillard’s
government isn’t getting a lift in opinion polls as tourism,
manufacturing and retail industries struggle with the sustained
strength of the local currency. A Newspoll survey today showed
support for the ruling  Labor Party  slid even after the central
bank lowered  interest rates  at its past two meetings, the
government announced cash handouts, the economy expanded twice
as fast as forecast, and employment growth accelerated.  Labor’s primary vote dropped 1 percentage point to 31
percent and the Liberal-National opposition fell 2 points to 44
percent, the survey published in the Australian showed. The poll
of 1,146 people was taken June 7-10 and had a margin of error of
3 percentage points. The Greens gained 2 percentage points to 14
percent.  Borrowing Costs  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia lowered borrowing costs by 75
basis points in the past two meetings, to 3.5 percent,
benefiting households in a nation where almost 90 percent of
mortgages have variable rates.  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  last week expressed optimism
about the nation’s outlook in a speech titled “The Glass Half
Full.” Stevens said he felt the need to do some
“cheerleading” for the economy in response to negative
commentary on the country’s prospects. The governor is due to
address the conference in Brisbane tomorrow.  “While shaping change is at the heart of our efforts,
confidence is the soul of our sense of economic wellbeing,”
Gillard wrote today. “You don’t get hard things done without
believing in yourself.”  Australian employers unexpectedly added workers in May, as
the number of people employed rose by 38,900, capping the best
January-to-May period of hiring in five years, a government
report showed June 7. A day earlier, data showed that compared
with a year earlier, the economy expanded 4.3 percent in the
first quarter, the fastest annual pace since of 2007.  The nation’s economy is being powered by an estimated A$500
billion ($493 billion) pipeline of resource projects that is
spurring hiring by companies including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
