China’s stocks  fell for the fourth
time in five days as concern  Spain ’s bailout plan won’t be
enough to tame  Europe ’s debt crisis overshadowed higher-than-
estimated new Chinese bank loans.  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , the listed unit of China’s
second-biggest steelmaker, declined 3.3 percent after it cut
product prices. China Shenhua Energy Co., the largest coal
producer, led a gauge of energy producers to the  biggest drop 
among industry groups on concern Europe’s economic problems may
slow global growth. Spanish and Italian bond yields surged
yesterday as investors turned their attention to debt auctions
in  Italy  this week and elections on June 17 that may determine
whether Greece stays in the euro.  “The European debt crisis is the biggest risk to the stock
market now and will cut investors’ risk appetite,” said Wang Weijun, a strategist at Zheshang Securities Co. in  Shanghai .
“It looks like the problem is spreading to bigger countries
such as Spain and Italy, which is the last thing investors want
to see.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 16.07 points, or 0.7
percent, to 2,289.79 at the close, with 30-day  volatility  at
14.73, the lowest since June 1. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  fell 0.7
percent to 2,540.18. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies,
retreated 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Even with today’s drop, the Shanghai index has advanced 4.1
percent this year on expectations the government will increase
spending on infrastructure and ease monetary policies to spur
growth. Stocks in the measure are valued at 9.91 times estimated
earnings, compared with the five-year average of 17.8, according
to weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  New Loans  The Shanghai Composite gained the most in almost two weeks
yesterday after China’s trade expanded more than economists
estimated in May and inflation slowed. About 6.5 billion shares
changed hands in the Shanghai Composite yesterday, 27 percent
lower than the daily average this year.  BNP Paribas cut its estimates for Chinese bank profits and
margins after China lowered  interest rates  last week. Lenders
will be able to offer deposit rates by up to 10 percent more
than the benchmark, analyst Dorris Chen wrote in a note dated
yesterday. Profit estimates were cut by an average of 1.3
percent for 2012 and 6.1 percent for 2013, Chen wrote.  China Construction Bank Corp. (601939) , the country’s second-largest
bank, slid 0.7 percent to 4.42  yuan . Bank of China Ltd. dropped
0.3 percent to 3.01 yuan. China Merchants Bank Co. retreated 1.3
percent to 10.81 yuan.  Local-currency loans were 793.2 billion yuan ($125
billion), the People’s Bank of China said yesterday. That
compared with the 700 billion yuan median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 29 economists and 681.8 billion yuan in
April. M2 money supply grew 13.2 percent last month from a year
earlier, compared with an estimate of 12.9 percent.  Developers Gain  The loan data bolstered the outlook for  developers , which
jumped 1.8 percent as a group on the Shanghai Composite.  Poly
Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , the second-biggest developer, climbed 4
percent to 14.63 yuan. Gemdale Corp., the fourth largest, gained
3.1 percent to 7.27 yuan. Financial Street Holding Co. added 2.8
percent to 6.96 yuan.  Guangdong Huaxing Bank is studying plans to offer a 30
percent discount off the benchmark interest rate on loans to
first-home buyers, the Guangzhou Daily reported today, citing
the lender. Some large banks this week may start offering as
much as a 20 percent discount of the benchmark interest rate on
loans to first-home buyers, the newspaper said.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  dropped 0.7 percent today.
Spain’s 10-year bond yield climbed the most in almost a month
yesterday as optimism faded that the nation’s 100 billion euro
($125 billion) bank bailout will stop Europe’s debt crisis from
spreading. Greece is scheduled to have an election on June 17,
which will decide if the nation will stay in the  euro zone .  Coal Outlook  Baoshan Steel dropped 3.3 percent to 4.43 yuan. Prices were
cut by as much as 400 yuan a metric ton for July delivery, with
most hot-rolled and cold-rolled products reduced by 200 yuan a
ton, the company said. Hebei Iron & Steel Co., the listed unit
of China’s biggest steelmaker, lost 2 percent to 2.88 yuan.
Angang Steel Co. slid 1 percent to 4 yuan.  A measure of energy stocks in the CSI 300 tumbled 2.1
percent today, the most among the 10 industry groups. Shenhua,
the nation’s largest coal producer, declined 2.4 percent to
23.59 yuan. China Coal Energy Co., the second biggest, fell 1.9
percent to 8.38 yuan.  Datong Coal Industry Co. (601001) , the third
largest, lost 2.2 percent to 11.99 yuan.  Societe Generale SA reduced its 2012 coal-price forecasts
because of the “poor performance” in the global economy and a
slowdown in energy demand in  emerging markets . It cut its
forecast for average 2012 CIF ARA coal to $109.70 a metric ton
from $113.80.  U.S.-Traded Stocks  Chinese stocks  traded in the U.S. fell, led by Ctrip.com
International Ltd. The slump in the Bloomberg China stock
measure erased its gains this year for a 0.1 percent loss. The
iShares FTSE  China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest U.S.-listed China
exchange-traded fund, dipped 0.1 percent to $32.79 in its second
day of declines.  The central bank cut benchmark interest rates last week for
the first time since 2008 after the economy expanded at the
slowest pace in 11 quarters in the January-March period, and May
consumer prices rose the least in two years. May exports and
import growth topped estimates, data showed on June 10.  “There’s a lot weighing on investors’ minds beside Chinese
growth figures, even though the import and export numbers were
positive,”  Christopher Palmer , who helps manage $2.5 billion of
assets as London-based director of global emerging markets for
Henderson Global Investors Ltd., said by phone yesterday.
“Investors are still hesitant to commit to  China  having been
told that things were OK in Europe, which is its biggest trading
partner, and now finding out that Spain needs a bailout.”  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
