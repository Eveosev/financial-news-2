Los Angeles  Dodgers outfielder  Andre Ethier  has agreed to a five-year contract extension, seven
months after teammate  Matt Kemp  got a franchise-record eight-
year, $160 million deal.  Ethier, 30, leads the National League with 53 runs batted
in this season while hitting .287 with 10 home runs. He’s spent
his entire seven-year Major League Baseball career with the
Dodgers, hitting .291 with 119 homers and 499 RBIs.  “This is the place I’ve wanted to be all along and I hope
to finish my career in Los Angeles playing for these fans that I
have developed such a special bond with,” Ethier said today at
a news conference. “Now we just have to go out and finish our
goal of winning a world championship for this great city.”  Ethier, who is making almost $11 million this season and
would have been eligible for free agency in 2013, has helped the
Dodgers to baseball’s best record this season at 39-23.  Ethier’s extension with the Dodgers is worth $85 million
and has a $17.5 million vesting option for 2018 based on plate
appearances in 2017 or 2016-17, MLB.com reported, citing an
unidentified industry official.  The Dodgers in November 2011 gave Kemp a contract that
exceeded the team-record seven-year, $105 million deal pitcher
 Kevin Brown  signed in 1998. Ethier’s contract would be the third
biggest in franchise history, MLB.com said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
