The  Toronto Blue Jays  granted
Vladimir Guerrero’s request to be released from his minor-league
contract, making the 2004 American League Most Valuable Player a
free agent.  Guerrero, 37, signed with the Blue Jays last month and was
hitting .303 with four runs batted in over eight games for the
team’s Triple-A minor-league affiliate. He also had four homers
and eight RBI in four games at the Class-A level.  Guerrero now can sign with any team after asking the Blue
Jays to promote him to the majors or release him, MLB.com said.  In 16 Major League Baseball seasons, Guerrero has a .318
average with 449 home runs, 1,496 runs batted in, 181 stolen
bases and 477 doubles. He’s topped 25 home runs and 100 RBI in
the same season 10 times, most recently in 2010. Guerrero has
played for the Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Angels, Texas Rangers
and  Baltimore Orioles .  To contact the reporter on this story:
