Crime in  South Africa , the
continent’s largest economy, is declining, according to the
country’s Cabinet.  The Cabinet remains concerned about the violent nature of
crime and an increased number of police officers being killed,
it said in a statement released in  Pretoria  today.  Crime statistics for the year through March will be relased
later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
