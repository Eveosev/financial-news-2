Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH)  asked
a federal judge to dismiss Tenet Healthcare Corp.’s lawsuit
seeking to recover costs incurred rebuffing a takeover bid this
year.  Lawyers for Franklin, Tennessee-based Community Health
asked U.S. District Judge Barbara M.G. Lynn in  Dallas  today to
dismiss the suit, arguing that hospital operator Tenet had no
legal standing to seek costs.  Community Health, the second-largest U.S. hospital company,
dropped its $7.3 billion bid in May after the board of Dallas-
based Tenet rejected the all-cash takeover offer as “grossly
inadequate.” A month earlier, Tenet sued Community Health,
accusing it of defrauding Medicare, the federal health insurance
program. Community Health called the suit “baseless.”  “This lawsuit has nothing to do with righting an
actionable wrong,” Community Health said in a court filing.
“It is about Tenet’s public relations campaign against its
rival.”  Tenet is seeking unspecified “costs and disbursements
incurred in connection with analyzing defendants’ materially
false and misleading proxy solicitations and statements, and
economic harm related thereto.”  The case is  Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC)  v. Community Health
Systems Inc., 3:11-00732, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of  Texas  (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
