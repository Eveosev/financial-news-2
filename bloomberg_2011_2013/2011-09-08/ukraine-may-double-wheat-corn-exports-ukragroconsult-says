Ukraine may double its wheat and
corn exports in the marketing year which started July 1,
according to researcher UkrAgroConsult.  The nation may export as much as 10 million metric tons of
corn and the same amount of wheat, Serhiy Feofilov, director of
UkrAgroConsult, said at a conference in Moscow today.  Ukraine exported 4 million tons of wheat and 5 million tons
of corn last year when the country had quotas in place to
protect domestic supply amid poor harvests due to a drought.  UkrAgroConsult  raised its corn production forecast to 15.5
million tons from last monthâ€™s 15 million ton estimate, Feofilov
said.  The researcher reduced its production outlook for wheat to
20.3 million tons from its August estimate of 20.6 million tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
