Turkey’s threat to send warships as
Cyprus prepares to drill for oil in its offshore territory will
be in breach with of European and international law, Cypriot
minister of defense Demetris Eliades said, according to the
 Cyprus News Agency .  Turkey remains exposed in the eyes of the international
community with its overt threats against the east Mediterranean
island, putting its European Union accession at risk, Eliades
said, according to a  statement  on CNA’s website today.  Cyprus’s stance is based on international law and its
sovereign right to explore and exploit natural gas resource in
its offshore territory, the minister said, according to CNA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
