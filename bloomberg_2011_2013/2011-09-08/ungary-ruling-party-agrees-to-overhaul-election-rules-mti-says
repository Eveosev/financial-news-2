Hungary’s ruling party Fidesz
supports scrapping the current two-round electoral system in
favor of a single round and give all Hungarians abroad the right
to vote, MTI reported, without citing anyone.  Fidesz’s members of parliament also support keeping the
current “mixed” vote by which citizens vote for both a party
and individual candidates, the state-run news agency said.
Fidesz held an internal party vote on the proposals at a meeting
today in Hajduszoboszlo, MTI said.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
