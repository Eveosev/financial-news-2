Verbund AG (VER) ,  Austria ’s biggest power
company, had its biggest decline ever after cutting its guidance
for 2011 and giving a “cautious” outlook for next year.  Shares fell 11.6 percent to 22.2 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of Vienna trading, plummeting the most since Bloomberg
started collecting data. Verbund was today’s worst performer on
the 28-member Bloomberg European Utilities Index, which lost 3.3
percent.  The company sees operating result of around 780 million
euros ($1.08 billion) and net income at about 380 million euros,
according to a statement late yesterday. It previously had
forecast the measures would “remain at nearly the same level as
in the previous year,” when it had operating profit of 828.5
million euros and net income of 400.8 million euros.  In 2012 the Vienna-based utility expects an operating
result of around 900 million euros to 1 billion euros and net
income of 450 million euros to 500 million euros, Verbund said  The “cautious 2012 guidance will disappoint,” Arsalan Obaidullah, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in  London , wrote in a
note to customers today, adding that the top end of the net
guidance is 19 percent below his estimate, and 21 percent below
consensus.  “Given Verbund shares have outperformed the utility sector
by 5 percent since the start of August, we expect weakness on
the back of this,” the analyst said.  This year’s forecast is based on the “assumption of a
hydro coefficient” of 0.92 and an exchange rate of 2.13 Turkish
liras per euro, Verbund said. The 2012 outlook is based on an
“average water supply, an average market price for electricity
of 57 euros per megawatt-hour for base load and 71 euros per
megawatt-hour for peak load and an exchange rate of 2.17 Turkish
liras per euro.”  Verbund reiterated that it intends to distribute 45 percent
to 50 percent of net income as dividends to shareholders.  The company also said that it plans to invest 2.6 billion
euros in domestic and international power plant and network
expansion projects between 2012 and 2016. It previously had
planned to invest 2.4 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
