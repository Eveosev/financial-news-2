Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , the biggest lender in
the Baltic states, is better prepared than in 2008 to weather
another wave of financial turmoil in the Baltic region, said
Brigitte Bonnensen, the head of the bank’s Baltic operations.  “We’ve done a clean-up job,” Bonnensen, told journalists
in Vilnius today. “Irrespective of whether this second storm is
coming or not, we are much better prepared. We’re in a better
position to guide our clients.”  Stockholm-based Swedbank was hurt during the global
financial crisis after its Baltic operations suffered losses
because of the region’s property-market collapse. The bank
relied on government guarantees for funding until July 2009 and
was forced to raise a combined 27.5 billion kronor ($4.31
billion) in two share sales during the financial crisis to
replenish its capital.  Swedbank estimates economies in Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia will slow next year as Europe’s debt crisis worsens and
the global economy weakens, damping export orders. Estonia may
grow 4.2 percent next year, while Latvia may expand 3.5 percent
and Lithuania 4.7 percent, the bank said on Aug. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
