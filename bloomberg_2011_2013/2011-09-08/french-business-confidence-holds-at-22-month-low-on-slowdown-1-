French business confidence held a
22-month low in August on concern that slowing global economic
growth will hurt demand in coming months.  The Bank of  France ’s Business Sentiment Indicator for
manufacturers was unchanged at 98, the central bank said in a
statement today. That matches the July rate, which was the
lowest since October 2009. Economists expected a reading of 97,
according to the median of four forecasts gathered by Bloomberg
News.  France’s expansion almost stalled in the second quarter,
forcing President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s government to slash its
full-year growth forecast and close tax breaks to raise funds.
U.S. President  Barack Obama  will lay out his plans for reviving
U.S. growth later today, as will European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  following the monthly meeting of its
Governing Council.  “French firms continue to be worried about the ongoing
slowdown in global growth and the unusually uncertain economic
outlook,” said Pierre-Olivier Beffy, chief economist at Exane
BNP Paribas in Paris.  The sentiment reading implies growth of 0.1 percent in the
third quarter, the Bank of France said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
