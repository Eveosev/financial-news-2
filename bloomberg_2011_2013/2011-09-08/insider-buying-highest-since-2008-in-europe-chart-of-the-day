More executives at European
companies are buying their stock than at any time since the
worst period of the financial crisis in 2008.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that insider buying of shares
climbed in August to its highest level since October 2008,
according to data compiled by Citigroup Inc. That preceded a 84
percent jump in the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index from March
2009 to the gauge’s peak this year on Feb. 17.  “Directors have a good ability in timing the market,”
Chris Montagu, a London-based quantitative strategist at
Citigroup, wrote in a report dated Sept. 6. “One can conclude
that, at this juncture, directors see current valuations as an
attractive entry point.”  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slumped 16 percent
from the end of July through Sept. 6 when the gauge reached its
lowest level since July 2009. Equities tumbled amid concern that
global economic growth is slowing as the European sovereign-debt
crisis spreads. The index’s valuation slid to 9.1 times the
estimated profits of its constituent companies during August,
the lowest price-earnings ratio since March 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
