Axa Investment Managers UK Ltd., a
unit of  Europe ’s second-largest insurer, said it started a high-
yield bond fund that invests in short-dated securities.  The Axa IM FIIS Europe Short Duration High Yield fund is
managed by London-based Andrew Wilmont and will invest in euro-
and pound-denominated corporate bonds, the asset manager said in
a statement today. The securities in the fund will have an
average duration of less than two years.  High-yield, or junk, bonds are graded below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings. European junk bonds lost 3.1 percent this year compared
with a return of 14.7 percent in 2010, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
