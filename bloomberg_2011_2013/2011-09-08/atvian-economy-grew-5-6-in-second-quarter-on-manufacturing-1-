Latvia’s economy grew faster than
previously estimated in the second quarter as the manufacturing
and transportation sectors expanded.  Gross domestic product rose 5.6 percent from a year
earlier, according to revised data released today by the Riga-
based  statistics office . That compares with a preliminary
estimate of 5.3 percent. The economy grew a seasonally adjusted
2 percent from the previous three months, the office said.  Latvia’s economy started to recover in the second half of
2010 and is more shielded from market turbulence than three
years ago, when the global financial crisis sent it into
Europe’s deepest recession, the Finance Ministry said last
month. The economy may expand about 5 percent this year,
according to the ministry.  Private consumption grew 10 percent from to a year earlier
and transport expanded 9 percent, the statistics office said.
Manufacturing of prefabricated metal products increased 37
percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
