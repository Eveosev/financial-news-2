Sudan received a $150 million loan
from the Islamic Development Bank to finance the construction of
the Atbara and Setet hydropower dams north of Khartoum, the
state-run  SUNA  news agency reported.  The loan was signed on the sidelines of a meeting of Arab
finance ministers in the United Arab Emirates yesterday, the
Khartoum-based agency said.  The two dams will provide 200 megawatts of electricity when
completed within four years, the state-run Sudanese Media Center
reported on April 16. The Merowe dam, also north of Khartoum,
currently supplies 80 percent of the 1,250 megawatts consumed in
Sudan, according to SMC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
