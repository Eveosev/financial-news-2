Ethanol futures fell to a four-week
low in  Chicago  on concern demand will suffer amid signs of a
struggling economy.  Futures slipped for a third day after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the fiscal tightening by Congress
may hurt the fragile economic recovery. Ethanol is mixed with
gasoline to augment supply.  “That’s why we were down,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst
at the Linn Group in Chicago, referring to the economy.
“Ethanol held up better than corn.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery decreased 3.4 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $2.775 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest settlement price since Aug. 10. Futures have
gained 46 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  fell 3.5 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $2.94 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive lost 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.945, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast declined 3 cents, or 1 percent,
to $2.995 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel rose 0.5 cent to
$2.855.  U.S. ethanol production climbed 0.9 percent to 896,000
barrels a day in the week ended Sept. 2, according to the Energy
Department. Stockpiles dropped 4.5 percent to 17.1 million
barrels, the lowest level since the week ended Dec. 31.  “That implies you have very strong demand,” Kitt said.
“Ethanol held up better than everything else because of strong
fundamentals.”  Corn for December delivery fell 14 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $7.34 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
