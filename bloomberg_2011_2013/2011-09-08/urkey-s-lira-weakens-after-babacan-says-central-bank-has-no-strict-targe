The lira declined after Deputy Prime
Minister Ali Babacan said the central bank is not “strictly
committed” to ensuring a particular level for the currency.  The lira dropped 0.3 percent to 1.7633 per dollar at 9:10
a.m. in Istanbul.  “We’re not saying in an hardened manner that this much up,
or this much down for the currency is out of the question, and
it’s out of the question that the central bank will have such a
strict approach,” Babacan said in an interview with Bloomberg
HT television in Ankara after markets closed yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
