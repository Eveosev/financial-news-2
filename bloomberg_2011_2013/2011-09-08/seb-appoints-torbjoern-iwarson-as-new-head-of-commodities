SEB AB, Sweden’s fourth-biggest bank

head of commodities.  He will start at the Stockholm-based company on Sept. 19,
spokeswoman Elisabeth Lennhede said today by e-mail.  Iwarson was previously  Svenska Handelsbanken AB (SHBA) ’s head of
commodities and SEB said in June it hired Iwarson and three
colleagues from the rival bank. He replaces Mikael Nordstroem,
who resigned on Aug. 31.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
