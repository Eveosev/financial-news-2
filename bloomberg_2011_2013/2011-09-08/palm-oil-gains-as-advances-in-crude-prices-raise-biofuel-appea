Palm oil  gained for a second day as
advances in crude oil lifted the appeal of vegetable oils used
in food and fuels.  The November-delivery contract advanced as much as 1.1
percent to 3,076 ringgit ($1,030) per metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning trading session at
3,064 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Futures have climbed 15 percent
in the past year.  Oil traded near the highest close in five weeks in  New York 
on speculation a storm building in the  Gulf of Mexico  poses a
threat to supplies in the U.S., which have already been reduced
by an earlier cyclone.  Crude oil’s gains “will give the underlying support” to
palm oil, Chandran Sinnasamy, trading head at LT International
Futures (M) Sdn., said in  Kuala Lumpur .  Crude for October delivery traded at $89.31 a barrel, down
3 cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 12:34 p.m. Singapore time. The contract yesterday
surged $3.32 to $89.34, the highest close since Aug. 3.  Palm oil may trade between 3,020 ringgit and 3,070 ringgit
a ton today as investors are cautious ahead of a “critical”
report on grains and oilseeds from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Chandran said. The USDA will release its field-
based production estimates for corn and soybeans on Sept. 12.  “People are expecting lower production for soybean, that’s
why soybean oil is holding very well, and palm oil is taking
cues from there,” Rajesh Modi, a trader at Singapore-based
Sprint Exim Pte., said by phone.  Soybean futures for November delivery gained as much as 0.2
percent to $14.23 a bushel in Chicago, while  soybean oil  for
delivery in December climbed as much as 0.2 percent to 58.78
cents a pound.  Palm oil for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
dropped as much as 0.9 percent to 8,960 yuan ($1,403) per ton,
while soybean oil for delivery in the same month declined as
much as 0.7 percent to 10,416 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
