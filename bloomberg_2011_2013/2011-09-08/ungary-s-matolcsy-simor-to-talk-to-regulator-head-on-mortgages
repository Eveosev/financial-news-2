Hungary’s Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy and central bank President Andras Simor plan to invite
Karoly Szasz, chairman of financial regulatory agency PSZAF, to
join talks on the problems of foreign-currency mortgage holders.  The three will probably meet as early as next week to
discuss the issue, Andras Karman, state secretary at the economy
ministry, said in an interview with state-run M1 television
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
