Hebei Sailhero Environmental
Protection High-tech Co. led gains among Chinese energy-
efficiency sector stocks on prospects the government will step
up efforts to cut energy consumption.  China’s State Council reiterated its five-year goal of
cutting energy use per unit of gross domestic product by 16
percent in a statement on the government’s website yesterday.  “We expect more support policies to come out and more
projects to start in different parts of the country in the
second half than in the first half,” Wang Haixu and Wu Fei,
analysts at Citic Securities Co., wrote in a report today in
response to the government statement.  Hebei Sailhero jumped 7.3 percent to 16.86 yuan as of 10:18
a.m. in Shenzhen, the most since Aug. 22. Dalian East New Energy
Development Co. advanced 5.6 percent to 27.06 yuan while
Shenzhen Green Eco-manufacture Hi-tech Co. rose 2.5 percent to
24.43 yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
