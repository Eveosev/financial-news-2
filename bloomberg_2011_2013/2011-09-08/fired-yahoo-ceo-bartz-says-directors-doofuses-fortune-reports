Carol Bartz , who was fired as Yahoo!
Inc.’s chief executive officer this week, said the company’s
board “f---ed me over” in an interview with Fortune magazine.  Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock read a lawyer’s prepared
statement to fire Bartz by phone on Sept. 6 while she was in  New
York  for a Citigroup Inc. technology conference, Fortune said.  “I said, ‘Roy, I think that’s a script,” Bartz told
Fortune. “Why don’t you have the balls to tell me yourself?’”  Bartz also said Yahoo’s directors were “spooked by being
cast as the worst board in the country” after they were
criticized for turning down a deal to sell the company to
Microsoft Corp., Fortune said. “Now they’re trying to show that
they’re not the doofuses that they are,” she said in the story.  Bartz also told Fortune she remains on Yahoo’s board and
plans to stay on as a director.  “Ms. Bartz is obligated to resign from the board and we
expect her to do so,” Charlie Sipkins, a spokesman for the
directors of Yahoo, said in an interview with Bloomberg.  Bartz, 63, took the helm at Sunnyvale, California-based
Yahoo in January 2009. She was ousted after a reign marked by
falling sales, lost share to rivals and a dispute with Asian
partners that stunted growth in the world’s largest Web market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
