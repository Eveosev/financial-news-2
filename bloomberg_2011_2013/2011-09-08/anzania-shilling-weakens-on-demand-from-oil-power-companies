Tanzania’s shilling weakened as oil
and power companies increased demand for dollars.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy
depreciated as much as 0.7 percent to 1,632.9 per dollar and
traded 0.1 percent down at 1,623.5 by 1:14 p.m in  Dar es Salaam ,
the commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There has been demand coming in from the oil and power
sectors for dollars, which left the shilling at the back foot
today,” Zainul Chandoo, head treasurer at Stanbic Bank Tanzania
Ltd., Standard Bank Group’s local unit, said in a phone
interview. “We have also seen some demand for dollars in the
 interbank market , but we believe it is influenced by the same
sectors.”  The shilling has lost 8.6 against the dollar this year,
making it  Africa ’s worst performer after Uganda and Kenya’s
currencies. Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 13 percent in
July, the fastest pace in 15 months, on higher on higher energy
and food costs, the National Bureau of Statistics said Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
