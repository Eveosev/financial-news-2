Water bubbling through a crack in
the court surface forced a halt to play in the U.S. Open match
between Andy Roddick of the U.S. and David Ferrer of Spain.  Roddick and Ferrer had played two games today in their
match, which was suspended by rain yesterday. Roddick, the 2003
U.S. Open champion, leads the fourth-round match 4-2.  Workers are on the court at Louis Armstrong Stadium, the
No. 2 arena at the National Tennis Center in New York, trying to
repair the leak. There is no word when or where play might
resume.  Rain the past two days wiped out all but 10 games on the
tournament schedule.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
