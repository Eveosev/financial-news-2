Daimler AG (DAI)  forecasts that the global
truck market will continue to expand this year,  Financial Times
Deutschland  said in a preview of a story that will run tomorrow,
citing Andreas Renschler, head of Daimler’s trucks unit.  While “growth will slow slightly, it will still be
upward,” the German newspaper said today, citing an interview
with Renschler. In the U.S., the truck market is likely to grow
between 30 and 35 percent this year and continue expanding in
2012, he told the newspaper. The market in Europe as a whole
will probably triple this year, FTD cited Renschler as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
