Turkish stocks gained to the highest
in a month, led by banks, on speculation that the central bank
may lower reserve requirements for lenders or allow them to
switch some of the funds to foreign currency.  The main ISE National 100 climbed 1,453.76, or 2.6 percent,
to 56,691.98 at 5:30 p.m. The banking index rose 3.6 percent to
118,021.1, the strongest since Aug. 4.  “The central bank mentioned they could allow banks to bank
some of their lira reserves in foreign exchange in the investor
meeting this week,” Funda Afacan, a trader at BGC Partners in
Istanbul, said by instant message today. “We’re expecting that
to be announced soon.”  Turkey’s central bank has raised banks’ reserve
requirements to help stem a credit bubble that widened the
current account to a record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
