OAO Bashneft, controlled by Russian
billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov ’s AFK Sistema, may offer
 India ’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp. access to Russian arctic  oil
fields  in exchange for assets as development spending starts.  Bashneft is reviewing a number of ONGC assets to take in
exchange for access to the Trebs and Titov deposits, slated to
start output in 2013, Bashneft President Alexander Korsik told
reporters in Moscow today.  Bashneft won a state tender for the deposits last year for
18.5 billion rubles ($626 million) after all other contestants
were disqualified including OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer. Bashneft sold Lukoil a 25 percent stake in the
project in April for 4.7 billion rubles. ONGC is considering
buying a stake in Bashneft with a group of Indian companies,
Bashneft Chairman Alexander Goncharuk said in June.  Bashneft will spend 4.5 billion rubles developing the Trebs
and Titov deposits this year and 9 billion next year, Alexander
Dashevsky, Bashneft vice president for production, told
journalists. Lukoil will add to that investment in proportion to
its share, he said.  Net income rose 44 percent to $532 million in the three
months ended June from the previous quarter, Bashneft said today
in an e-mailed statement. That beat the average estimate of $424
million from four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Revenue
rose 30 percent to $4.52 billion, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
