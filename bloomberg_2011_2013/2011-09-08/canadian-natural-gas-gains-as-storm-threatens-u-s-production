Canadian natural gas rose for a
second day amid speculation a storm in  Mexico ’s Bay of Campeche
could threaten supplies from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  Tropical Storm Nate is almost stationary over the bay with
maximum sustained winds of about 60 miles (97 kilometers) an
hour, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said in a report at
2 p.m. New York time. Reconnaissance aircraft will visit Nate
today to try to determine what path the storm will take.  “Nobody’s really sure what’s going to happen with Nate,”
said  Martin King , senior commodities analyst at FirstEnergy
Capital Corp. in Calgary. “People are treading very
carefully.”  Alberta gas for October delivery rose 6.25 cents, or 1.8
percent, to C$3.50 per gigajoule ($3.54 per million British
thermal units) as of 3:30 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX, 
a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is
shipped to users in Canada and the U.S., and is priced on
TransCanada Corp.’s  Alberta  system.  Gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 4 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $3.98 per
million Btu.  U.S. stockpiles of the fuel in underground storage rose 64
billion cubic feet, or 2.2 percent, to 3.025 trillion cubic feet
last week, the Energy Department said today. The increase
matched the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Spot Prices  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
rose 4.28 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $4.037 per million British
thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an
express line that can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day
to the Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas was up 7.83 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.8673,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas gained 6.61 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $3.9151.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.4 billion cubic
feet, 323 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.65 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.77 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.35 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.41 billion cubic feet today, about 51
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.9
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
