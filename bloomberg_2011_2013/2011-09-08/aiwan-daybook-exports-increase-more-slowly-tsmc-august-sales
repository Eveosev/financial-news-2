Taiwan â€™s exports rose at the slowest
pace in almost two years in August, missing estimates, as
moderating global growth hurt demand from the U.S. and  China .  Exports increased 7.2 percent from a year earlier, compared
with a 17.6 percent gain in July, the  Ministry of Finance  said
in Taipei yesterday, after the market closed. The median of 18
estimates was for a 15.5 percent advance. Imports rose 6.4
percent for a trade surplus of $2.63 billion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
