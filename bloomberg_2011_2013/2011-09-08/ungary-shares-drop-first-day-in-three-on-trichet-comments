Hungarian stocks dropped for the
first time in three days after European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said downside risks to the euro-area economy
have intensified.  The benchmark BUX index of shares fell 2.1 percent to
18,104.34 by 2:56 p.m. in Budapest. Mol Nyrt., the country’s
biggest refiner, slid 3 percent to 16,540 forint. The Hungarian
currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 277.2 per euro.  The region’s economy faces “particularly high uncertainty
and intensified downside risks,” Trichet said at a press
conference in  Frankfurt  today after the ECB left its benchmark
rate at 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
