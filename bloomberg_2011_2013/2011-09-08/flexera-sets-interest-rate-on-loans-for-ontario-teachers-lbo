Flexera Software Inc., the business
software management company, set the  interest rate  on $330
million of loans it’s seeking to finance its acquisition by
 Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan , according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  The $230 million first-lien term loan will pay 6 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. Libor, a rate banks charge to lend to each other will
have a 1.25 percent floor.  The Schaumburg, Illinois-based company is also seeking a
$100 million second-lien term loan that will pay 9.25 percentage
points more than Libor, with a 1.25 percent floor on the lending
benchmark, the person said.  The term loans will be issued at 98 cents on the dollar,
the person said, reducing proceeds for the borrower and boosting
the yield to investors.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  is arranging the deal, which includes a
$25 million revolving line of credit.  First-lien debt is repaid first in a bankruptcy or
liquidation, second-lien debt is repaid next. In a revolving
credit facility, money can be borrowed again once it’s repaid;
in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
