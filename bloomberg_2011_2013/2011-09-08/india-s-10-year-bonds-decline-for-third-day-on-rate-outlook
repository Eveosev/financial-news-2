India ’s 10-year bonds fell for a
third day on speculation the central bank will increase  interest
rates  next week to damp inflation that has held above nine
percent for eight months.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has raised its repurchase rate by
1.75 percentage points this year to 8 percent. The central bank
may increase the rate by 25 basis points at its review on Sept.
16, said Shubhada Rao, Mumbai-based chief economist at Yes Bank
Ltd. Volatility in global commodity prices continues to be a
“threat to price stability” in India, Deepak Mohanty, an
executive director at the Reserve Bank of India, said last week.  “The central bank would like to see credible signs of a
deceleration in inflation momentum,” Rao said. “ Oil prices 
also continue to be high.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.32 percent as of
10:04 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  The government will sell 110 billion rupees ($2.4 billion)
of notes due in 2017, 2021 and 2027 tomorrow, part of the
finance ministry’s 4.17 billion rupees target for the fiscal
year through March 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
