The  Ghanaian  government may require
 oil companies  to seek its approval before obtaining loans for
their operations if a draft petroleum exploration and production
bill becomes law, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  A section of the law, to be debated by the West African
nation’s lawmakers, said that loans taken by contractors must be
approved by the minister of energy, Darcy White, a tax leader at
the company’s  Ghana  office, said in a presentation on the bill
at a meeting in Accra, the capital, today.  “That can delay efforts,” he said, citing a lack of
provisions in the draft policy for a loan-approval timeline.
Interest on loans will be treated as a non-deductible expense on
taxes, according to White.  Ghana became Africa’s newest oil exporter in December with
the start of production at its offshore Jubilee oil field.
Companies including London-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) ,  Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. (APC)  of The Woodlands, Texas and  Eni SpA (ENI)  of Rome
operate in the West African nation.  The draft law will be presented to lawmakers when
Parliament returns from its recess next month, Moses Asaga,
chairman of the parliamentary sub-committee on mines and energy,
said in a telephone interview today. He declined to give details
on the policy.  The requirement may be meant to ensure that international
oil companies procure only loans that are competitive, Alex
Mould, chief executive officer of Ghana’s fuel-retailing
regulator National Petroleum Authority, said at the forum.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
