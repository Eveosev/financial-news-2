Gasoline inventories in northwest
 Europe  fell to the lowest level in almost nine months, partly
because of a shortfall in supply from  Germany ’s biggest
refinery, according to PJK International BV.  Motor fuel stockpiles dropped 7 percent to 535,000 metric
tons, the lowest level since the week ended Dec. 16, according
to PJK, a researcher based in Oosterhout, the Netherlands. The
data are for inventories in independent storage in the
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area.  A gasoline-production unit at the Miro refinery, Germany’s
largest facility, halted on Aug. 26, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter. Yvonne Schoenemann, a spokeswoman for
the refiner, declined to comment on the repairs on Sept. 1.  “Product has moved out of ARA to help fulfill
obligations,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by telephone,
referring to the Miro refinery close to Karlsruhe.  Naphtha stockpiles advanced the most since June, adding
25,000 tons to 65,000 tons, according to PJK. “Demand is slow
in petrochemicals,” Kulsen said.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoil, gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and
 jet fuel  in independent storage in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
