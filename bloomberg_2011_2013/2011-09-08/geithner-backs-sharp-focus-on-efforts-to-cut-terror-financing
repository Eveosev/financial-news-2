U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said U.S. efforts to disrupt financing for terrorist
organizations has been a central part of ensuring the nation’s
security.  “The effectiveness of our efforts over the past decade has
proven the value of a sharp focus on funding,” Geithner said in
 Washington  today in a speech at a symposium on counter-terrorism
financing. “Through the work of (the Office of Terrorism and
Financial Intelligence), Treasury has become an integral part of
the U.S. national security architecture and has expanded the
options available to the president to respond to threats.”  The Treasury Department symposium was to mark the 10 years
combating terror financing since the Sept. 11 attacks. The event
also included remarks by  David Cohen , Treasury undersecretary
for terrorism and financial intelligence, and  John Brennan ,
assistant to the president for homeland security and counter-
terrorism.  Geithner highlighted the role of Treasury’s counter
terrorism efforts to disrupt al-Qaeda over the last 10 years.  “While it was heartening to get confirmation that global
efforts to disrupt al-Qaeda’s financing had begun to pay off, we
are reminded that al-Qaeda remains an innovative, resourceful
and adaptive adversary,” Geithner said. “And we will need to
continue to innovate and adapt, as well, to maintain the impact
we began to see in recent years.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
