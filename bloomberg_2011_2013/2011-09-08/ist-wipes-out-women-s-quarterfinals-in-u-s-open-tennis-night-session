A steady mist has wiped out the
women’s quarterfinals tonight at the  U.S. Open  after rain washed
out all men’s matches for the day.  The U.S. Tennis Association earlier postponed the men’s
matches until tomorrow, and had hoped to fit in the four women’s
quarterfinals this evening.  Two men’s quarterfinals and four men’s fourth-round matches
were wiped out today, a day after all scheduled matches were
postponed by the rain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
