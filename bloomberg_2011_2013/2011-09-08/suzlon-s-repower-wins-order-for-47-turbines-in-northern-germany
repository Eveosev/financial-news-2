Repower Systems SE, a German company
owned by  Asia ’s third-largest maker of  wind turbines , won an
order for 47 of the units for projects in the country.  It signed deals with seven so-called community wind farms,
typically owned by local citizens including farmers, investors
and businesses to cut local energy costs, in Northern Friesland
to generate a total of 114.8 megawatts, according to a statement
today from the Hamburg-based unit of  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)   “Much of the value added stays in the region and the
citizens can play active roles in the planning process,” Chief
Executive Officer Andreas Nauen said in the statement.  WEB Andresen GmbH, a wind-energy consultant in Breklum,
will buy the turbines on behalf of a syndicate of the farms,
Caroline Zimmermann, a spokeswoman at Repower, said by e-mail.  The farms will be built at the end of next year or in 2013
and the agreements with Repower include a 15-year maintenance
contract with an option for an additional 5 years, according to
the statement. The terms of the transaction weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
