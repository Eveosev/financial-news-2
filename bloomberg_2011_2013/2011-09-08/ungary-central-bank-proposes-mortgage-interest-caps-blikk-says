The Hungarian central bank proposed
capping interest on foreign-currency mortgages and longer
interest periods on such loans to help borrowers burdened with
soaring repayments, daily  Blikk  said without saying how it
obtained the information.  Interest on household foreign-currency mortgages should be
capped at the central bank’s base rate plus 300 basis points and
interest periods should be extended to several years as opposed
to the current practice of six to 12 months, according to the
newspaper.  The proposals would eliminated banks’ extra charges on
loans, called “handling fees,”  and would allow borrowers to
repay their loans in foreign currencies, Blikk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
