Westfield
Group (WDC) , the world’s largest shopping mall owner by assets, said
it is assessing the Toronto Port Lands site for a possible
investment.  The Sydney-based group has met with Toronto officials to
discuss plans for the site, and is in the process of meeting
requirements under the city’s lobbyist registration law, the
company said in a statement on its website.  Toronto Councilor Doug Ford has held talks with Westfield
and other real estate and business leaders on a proposal that
will create a retail center on the site, the city’s Globe and
Mail newspaper reported on Sept. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
