Standard & Poor’s withdrew ratings
on LDK Solar Co., joining Moody’s Investors Service, following a
request from China’s second-biggest maker of solar wafers after
it delayed a planned offering of U.S. dollar-denominated debt.  “We withdrew LDK’s ratings at its request,” Jerry Fang,
S&P’s primary credit analyst, said by phone from Hong Kong.  Before the withdrawal, the rating company affirmed LDK’s B+
long-term rating and cut its Greater China credit scale rating
to cnBB- from cnBB, it said today in a statement. Moody’s
Investors Service withdrew LDK’s ratings on Aug. 26.  LDK says it delayed its offer of dollar-denominated senior
notes after interest rates rose. “Despite the postponement of
this bond offering, we still expect to generate sufficient
operating cash flow to support our business plan,” Chief
Executive Officer Peng Xiaofeng said in a May 19 statement.  The company, based in Xinyu, Jiangxi, planned to sell the
notes to repay debt with maturity of as much as a year. It
didn’t disclose the price, coupon or other terms.  The industry is grappling with falling demand in Europe,
where Germany, France and Italy cut subsidies for solar to cap
booming installations and rein in budgets. Solar panel prices
also slumped on rising output in China, the biggest producer.  LDK has declined 48 percent to $5.30 in New York trading
this year and last month cut its full-year revenue forecast to
as much as $2.7 billion from $3.7 billion previously.  To contact the reporter on this story:
