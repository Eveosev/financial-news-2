The Financial Services Authority won
a court order extending a freeze on some  MonoBank Plc (WNW)  assets,
arguing the online bank services company can’t solicit business
in the U.K. because it isn’t conducting business properly and
may not be authorized in the country.  Judge Guy Newey in London also renewed an order requiring
MonoBank to disclose information the FSA is seeking by tomorrow.
The extended deadline was suggested by the company, said  Ian
Smith , a lawyer for the financial regulator.  MonoBank, founded in 2004 and headquartered in London,
offers prepaid credit cards and services on the Internet to the
“credit challenged” and small-business market in North and
South America, Europe and Asia, according to its website. Its
shares are listed on in Frankfurt.  The company and its lawyers weren’t in court today. A call
to a number listed on the company website wasn’t answered by
MonoBank.  The case is: The Financial Services Authority v. MonoBank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
