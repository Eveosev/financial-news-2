Greece released a  list  of 6,000
companies owing a total of more than 30 billion euros ($41.8
billion) in backtaxes and will release individuals’ names after
completing procedures to override data protection laws.  Publication of names of both companies and individuals
“will significantly help to improve the efficiency of revenue
collection and to boost confidence between the ministry and
taxpayers by promoting transparency,” the Athens-based  Finance
Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Greece is cracking down on tax evasion to boost revenue as
part of reforms agreed in return for funding from the European
Union and International Monetary Fund. Total unpaid taxes amount
to 42 billion euros, according to the statement.  Net revenue decreased 6.4 percent to 26.8 billion euros in
the first seven months of the year on a deeper-than-forecast
recession that hit revenue and an increase in rebates to people
who paid too much tax in 2010, the ministry said in a statement
on Aug. 10.  The revenue shortfall will be “tackled during the next
months” as new tax rules come into effect, the ministry said.  Hellenic Railways Organization SA, which managed the
railway lines, owed the most with its outstanding tax dues at
1.3 billion euros, according to the statement.  The list named state and private companies including Larco
SA and Olympic Airways Services SA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
