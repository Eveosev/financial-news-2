Investors face a more imposing
collection of risks than they did before subprime-mortgage
losses spurred the biggest financial crisis since the 1930s,
said Eric Upin, chief investment officer at Makena Capital
Management LLC.  “The list of tail risks -- euro, banking crisis,
deflation, global recession and many others -- is much longer
with broader implications than anything we saw in 2007,” Upin,
who oversees $14.5 billion at the  Menlo Park , California-based
money manager, said today at the Bloomberg Global Inflation
Conference in  New York  hosted by Bloomberg Link. “Those titanic
forces are going to create tremendous undulations,” he said.
“It’s a completely different playbook and one that needs to be
very focused on lowering volatility and managing risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
