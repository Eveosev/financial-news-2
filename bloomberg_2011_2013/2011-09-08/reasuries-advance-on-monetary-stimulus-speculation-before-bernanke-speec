Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
note yields toward a record low, as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers will discuss at their meeting
this month the tools they may need to use to boost the recovery
and stand ready to employ them if necessary.  The extra yield investors get to hold 30-year bonds instead
of two-year notes was almost the smallest in a year on bets the
Fed may replace some of the central bank’s shorter-maturity U.S.
securities with longer-term debt to lower borrowing rates.
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  supported
demand for a refuge when he said “downside risks” to the  euro
area’s economy have intensified while President  Barack Obama 
prepared to explain his job-creation plan to Congress.  “The focus is squarely on the Fed and the prospects for
them to remain involved in Treasuries,” said  Richard Bryant ,
senior vice president in fixed income in New York at MF Global
Inc., one of the 20 primary dealers that trade directly with the
Fed. “The way is being paved in what will amount in some way,
shape or form to further asset purchases. Treasuries remain
well-supported.”  Yields on 10-year notes fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.98 percent at 5:24 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.125 percent
securities due in August 2021 rose 18/32, or $5.63 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 10/32. The yield slid on Sept. 6 to 1.9066
percent, the lowest on record.  Yield Curve  The 30-year bond yields decreased six basis points to 3.31
percent. Two-year yields were little changed at 0.19 percent.
The spread between two- and 30-year yields was 312 basis points
after falling on Sept. 6 to 308 basis points, the narrowest on a
closing basis since August 2010.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.1 percent after
earlier rising 0.5 percent. Crude oil for October delivery
decreased 0.6 percent to $88.65 a barrel.  Fed policy makers are prepared to use the tools they have
“as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in the
context of  price stability ,” Bernanke said in the text of a
speech to economists today in  Minneapolis . He said in previous
remarks the options include lengthening the average duration of
securities in its $1.65 trillion Treasury portfolio and buying
more  government bonds .  The speech is the first time Bernanke has commented about
the economy since a Labor Department report showed last week
that hiring stalled in August and the unemployment remained at
9.1 percent.  ‘Going Nowhere’  “We’ve got a labor market that’s going nowhere,” said
Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist in New York at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc., a primary dealer. “The pressure could pull
us to lower yields.” The 10-year yield may drop as low as 1.5
percent, he said.  The number of U.S. applications for unemployment insurance
payments unexpectedly rose to 414,000 last week from 412,000 in
the prior period, the Labor Department reported today.  Fed officials gather for a two-day meeting on Sept. 20 that
was expanded from the one day originally scheduled to “allow a
fuller discussion” of the economy and the central bank’s
possible policy response.  The yield on  Germany ’s 10-year bunds fell to a record low
1.823 percent as Trichet said at a Frankfurt press conference
that the European economy faces “particularly high uncertainty
and intensified downside risks.” The ECB held its target
lending rate at 1.50 percent, as forecast by all 57 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey.  European ‘Uncertainty’  “It will be difficult to see a back-up in yields, based on
the long-term structural uncertainty in  Europe  as well as
domestic fiscal and monetary policy,” said Christian Cooper,
head of U.S. dollar-derivatives trading in New York at Jefferies
Group Inc., a primary dealer. “The 10-year will be almost
bullet-proof. There will be significant buyers on dips.”  Treasuries fell yesterday as some traders bet President
Obama’s proposal to inject more than $300 billion into the
economy will spur growth.  The plan will likely entail tax cuts, infrastructure
spending and direct aid to state and local governments. He may
call on lawmakers to offset the cost of short-term jobs measures
by raising  tax revenue  later.  The difference between yields on 10-year Treasuries and
similar-maturity inflation-linked debt, a gauge of expectations
for inflation known as the break-even rate, was 2.02 percentage
points today after shrinking on Sept. 6 to 1.94 percentage
points, the narrowest since October 2010.  The government will sell $66 billion in three-, 10- and 30-
year debt next week, the Treasury Department reported, matching
the forecasts of 10 primary dealers in a Bloomberg News survey.
The U.S. will offer $32 billion of three-year notes, $21 billion
of 10-year debt and $13 billion of 30-year bonds in three daily
auctions beginning Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
