French port of Rouen, Europe’s biggest cereal-shipping hub,
declined 35 percent in the week through yesterday as the volume
of wheat shipped to Algeria fell to a five-week low.  Outbound shipments were 116,329 metric tons between Sept.
1 and Sept. 7, compared with 177,811 tons a week earlier, the
 Seine River port  said in an e-mailed report today. Cargoes
included 96,585 tons of wheat and 19,744 tons of barley.  Algeria, the biggest buyer of French grain, was the
leading destination with 72,945 tons of wheat compared with
103,280 tons a week earlier, as well as 13,500 tons of barley,
the port said.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of France’s wheat exports
in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay, which
shipped out 19 percent, according to data from national crops
