Madagascar Southern Petroleum Co., a
Chinese exploration company, discovered natural gas at its
concession near Sakaraha in the Indian Ocean island country’s
southern region, the Mines and Petroleum Ministry said.  The gas is “of very good quality” and the company will
continue drilling to determine the size of the deposit, the
Antananarivo-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
