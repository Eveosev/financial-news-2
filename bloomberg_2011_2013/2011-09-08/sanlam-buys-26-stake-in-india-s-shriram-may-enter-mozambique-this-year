Sanlam Ltd. (SLM) , the largest South
African-based insurer, will spend 1.9 billion rand
($266 million) to buy 26 percent of  India ’s Shriram Capital
as it expands outside its home market.  “We are also investigating a number of opportunities for
expansion in  Africa ,” the Cape Town-based insurer said in a
statement today. Sanlam may enter Mozambique by the end of the
year and is considering expansion in Southeast Asia, the company
said.  Sanlam, which also owns money managers, life insurance, and
property and casualty cover businesses in South Africa,  Nigeria ,
Kenya and Botswana, is seeking to spend 3.2 billion rand in
excess capital on purchases mostly in Africa and India to
counter slower growth in  South Africa . Money not spent on
expansion will be returned to investors, including buybacks when
Sanlam shares fall, the company said.  Sanlam gained 3.2 percent to 27.82 rand at the 5 p.m. close
of trading in Johannesburg. The stock is the worst-performing
security this year on the five-member FTSE/JSE Africa Life
Assurance Index, with a decline of 0.4 percent.  Earnings per share excluding one-time items and fund
transfers jumped 35 percent to 1.09 rand in the six months
through June, Sanlam said, beating the median estimate of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for adjusted earnings per share
of 1.01 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story: Renee Bonorchis in
