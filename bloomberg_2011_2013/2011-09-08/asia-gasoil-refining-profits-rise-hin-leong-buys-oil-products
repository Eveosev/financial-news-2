Profits from producing gasoil in
Asia rose. Hin Leong Trading Pte bought two cargoes of diesel at
a higher price than yesterday and purchased fuel oil in
Singapore.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought 180,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5 percent
sulfur from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at parity to benchmark prices,
and another similar-sized cargo of the same grade from BP Plc at
a premium of 10 cents, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window today. The
company paid a discount to spot prices for the fuel yesterday.  Gasoil’s crack spread compared with Dubai crude, a measure
of profit for refiners from the fuel, fell 19 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $17.22 a barrel at 6:32 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  Hin Leong bought 100,000 barrels of jet fuel from Shell for
70 cents below benchmark prices. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil,
or the regrade, widened 5 cents to $1.85 a barrel.  Fuel Oil  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought 20,000 metric tons of 380-
centistoke fuel oil from Hin Leong Trading Pte at $669 a ton,
the survey showed.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude shrank 50 cents, or 7
percent, to $6.70 a barrel at 3:09 p.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $110.28 a ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time from $96.56 a ton
at the end of trading in Asia yesterday, based on data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
