Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
Britain’s biggest government-controlled bank, reprieved two
offices slated for closure and committed to keep open a third
site, saving about 800 jobs.  RBS will keep its Norwich and Liverpool offices open after
last year announcing their closure, according to an internal e-
mail sent to staff and confirmed by a spokesman. The Liverpool
site will now form part of a 300-branch sale to Santander U.K.
Plc. RBS will also keep its Nottingham office open after earlier
saying it was under review.  “We announced last September that we would be reducing the
number of sites we operate from, and that regrettably this would
lead to job losses,” an RBS spokesman said. “We have today
communicated to staff in Norwich and Nottingham that these sites
will not close and in Liverpool we have confirmed that this site
will form part of our divestment to Santander.”  RBS has cut about 27,000 jobs since  Stephen Hester  took
over as chief executive officer from  Fred Goodwin  in 2008.
European banks announced more than 40,000 job cuts last month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, including 2,000 posts
axed by RBS’s securities unit, the bank said on Aug. 5.  “Unite is extremely pleased that the RBS has listened to
the concerns of staff and reversed its planned site closures,”
said  David Fleming , the  Unite  trade union national officer.
“This news is a significant boost to the RBS workforce in
Norwich, Nottingham and Liverpool after many months of
uncertainty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
