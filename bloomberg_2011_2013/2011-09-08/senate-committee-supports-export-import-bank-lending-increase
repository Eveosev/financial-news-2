The Senate Banking Committee backed
a 40 percent increase in lending authority for the U.S. Export-
Import Bank, sending to the full chamber legislation to keep the
bank in business.  Under the reauthorization measure, approved by a voice
vote, the loan ceiling would increase $10 billion annually, to
$140 billion, by fiscal year 2015, letting the bank make more
loans after borrowing by companies approached the current
maximum.  The Export-Import Bank, which is self-sustaining, provides
financing to U.S. exporters, including direct loans, guarantees
and payment insurance. The bankâ€™s outstanding loans may exceed
$80 billion this year, with the ceiling at $100 billion ceiling,
Chairman Fred Hochberg said in May.  Demand for bank support from companies such as  General
Electric Co. (GE) ,  KBR Inc. (KBR) ,  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Boeing Co. (BA)  surged
after the global financial system seized up in 2008 and banks
tightened borrowing requirements. The lender, chartered by
Congress, needs its authority renewed to operate beyond Sept.
30.  New loans will climb to a record for a third year after the
bank provided $24.5 billion in new financing in fiscal 2010,
Hochberg said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
