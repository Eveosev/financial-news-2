China ,  South Africa ,  India  and  South
Korea  are among  Kenya ’s top five sources of foreign direct
investment, Business Daily reported, citing the Kenya Investment
Authority.  The countries replaced the U.K.,  Germany  and the
Netherlands, who had been the main sources of FDI since the
country gained independence from Britain in 1963, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said.  China, the biggest source of Kenyan FDI, invested 40.2
billion shillings ($428 million) in the East African country
last year, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
