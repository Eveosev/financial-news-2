The  Dallas Cowboys  are the most
valuable National Football League franchise for the fifth
straight year, according to  Forbes magazine’s annual ranking .  The NFL’s 32 teams have an average value of $1.04 billion,
4 percent more than last season, with the Cowboys leading the
way at $1.85 billion. Team values dropped an average of 2
percent to $1.02 billion in the 2010 Forbes ranking, the only
decline since the survey started 13 years ago.  The  Washington Redskins  are second in franchise value at
$1.55 billion, followed by the  New England Patriots  at $1.4
billion. The  New York Giants  at $1.3 billion and the  New York
Jets  at $1.22 billion round out the top five.  Average team revenue rose 4 percent to $261 million during
the 2010 season, Forbes said. While operating income fell 8.1
percent because of higher costs for stadium operations, training
facilities and marketing, the NFL’s new labor agreement will
give owners a bigger portion of overall league revenue, the
survey found.  Owners will pay between 47 and 48 percent of total revenue
to players under the new collective bargaining agreement, down
from 51 percent under the previous accord.  The value of the top 10 teams rose an average of 4 percent
in the latest ranking because revenue-sharing payments by the
biggest franchises to low-revenue clubs drop under the new labor
deal, Forbes said.  All 32 NFL teams rank among the 50 most valuable sports
teams in the world, according to Forbes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
