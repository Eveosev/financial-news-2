Cumulus Media Inc. (CMLS)  won U.S.  Justice
Department  clearance to buy  Citadel Broadcasting Corp. (CDELB)  on
condition that the company sell three radio stations in two
markets to maintain competition in advertising.  Under a proposed settlement with the antitrust division of
the Justice Department, Atlanta-based Cumulus must divest two
stations in  Pennsylvania  and one in Michigan to buyers approved
by the division, according to court documents. The settlement
resolves a lawsuit the Justice Department filed today in
Washington federal court.  “The divestitures required by the consent decree will
enable radio advertisers to continue to receive the benefits of
competition” in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Flint, Michigan,
Sharis Pozen, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the
antitrust division, said today in an e-mailed statement.  The divestitures will reduce Cumulus’s share of advertising
revenue in those regions to less than 40 percent, the Justice
Department said in the statement.  Cumulus offered to buy Citadel in March in a deal valued at
$2.4 billion to expand coverage and cut costs. The companies’
 radio stations  compete to attract local and national advertising
that targets listeners in Harrisburg and Flint, according to the
complaint.  The acquisition of Las Vegas-based Citadel would have
eliminated the competition in those markets, increasing prices
and reducing levels of service in the sale of radio advertising
time, the U.S. said in the complaint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
