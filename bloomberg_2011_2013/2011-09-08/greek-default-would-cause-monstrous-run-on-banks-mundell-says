Nobel-prize winning economist  Robert Mundell , whose research contributed to creation of the euro,
said a Greek default would trigger a run on banks of “monstrous
proportions.”  “This risk means that issues in Greece and the euro area
are an international problem,” Mundell told reporters in
Budapest today.  Th European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve should
introduce a “very large” swap facility, in the range of $1
trillion, to tackle any potential dollar shortage, Mundell said.  Mundell, who is a professor of economics at Columbia
University in  New York , also said no country should leave the
euro area because it “doesn’t solve any of the problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
