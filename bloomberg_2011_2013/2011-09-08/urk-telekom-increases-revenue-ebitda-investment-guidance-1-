Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM)  increased
its guidance for consolidated revenue and earnings before tax
depreciation and amortization, citing “strong” gains in
revenue in the first half.  Turk Telekom expects consolidated revenue to rise between 9
percent and 10 percent compared with a previous 5-7 percent
estimated increase. This year’s forecast for the consolidated
earnings margin before tax, depreciation and amortization is
40-45 percent, Turk Telekom said in a filing to the Istanbul
exchange today. The previous forecast was for the low-to-mid 40
percent range.  Consolidated investment will be about 2.2 billion liras in
2011, the company said. The previous expectation was about 2
billion liras.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
