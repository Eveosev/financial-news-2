Benchmark European coal was little
changed, as Rhine river levels jumped.  Thermal coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp with settlement next year was little changed at $129.10
a metric ton at 12:07 a.m. in  London , according to broker prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The Rhine river level in Koblenz,
 Germany , which is Europe’s largest power market, jumped 15
percent today to 145 centimeters, according to data from the
Federal Institute of Hydrology on Bloomberg.  “Water levels on the Rhine River are currently around 138
centimeters, limiting the amount of coal that can be loaded on
ships. However, with upcoming forecasted rainfall the water
level is anticipated to reach an optimal 180 centimeters
level,”  Mark Pervan , an analyst with Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd., said today in a report.  Bloomberg tracks data from information supplied by ICAP
Plc, GFI Group Inc., Spectron Group Ltd., Credit Suisse Group
AG, IHS McCloskey, Tradition Financial Services and Tullett
Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
