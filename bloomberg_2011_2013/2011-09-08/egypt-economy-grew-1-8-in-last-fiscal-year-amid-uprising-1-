Egypt’s economy grew 1.8 percent in
the fiscal year that ended June 30, its weakest performance in
at least 10 years, amid an uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak
from the presidency in February.  The most-populous Arab nation grew 0.4 percent in the
fourth quarter of last fiscal year, Fayza Aboulnaga, minister of
planning and international co-operation, told reporters today.  “It’s very surprising,” Mohamed Abu Basha, an economist
at the Cairo-based investment bank EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, said
by telephone. “All the interim data, such as tourism, car
sales, labour protests, were pointing towards a contraction.”  Egypt’s economy contracted 4.2 percent January to March
amid the worst political crisis to hit the country in three
decades as revenue from industries such as tourism plummeted and
consumption declined.  The budget deficit is expected to widen to 9.9 percent of
gross domestic product this fiscal year from 9.5 percent,
according to EFG-Hermes. The government said in June it’s
targeting a budget gap of 8.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
