Pall Corp. (PLL) , a producer of water
filtration and purification systems, fell the most in more than
two years after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that
missed analysts’ estimates.  Pall dropped $3.96, or 7.9 percent, to $44.96 at 11:21 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It earlier traded
down 11 percent at $43.42, the biggest intraday decline since
March 12, 2009.  Profit excluding tax adjustments and costs for repayment of
debt rose to 76 cents a share in the three months ended July 31
from 72 cents a year earlier, the  Port Washington ,  New York- 
based company said in a statement today. That missed the 88-cent
average of 10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Operating profit at Pall’s industrial division was $52
million, $18 million less that a year earlier, the company said.  “Pall Industrial fell short of what we anticipated,”
Chief Executive Officer Eric Krasnoff said in the statement.
“The end result is that the fourth quarter is a disappointing
finish to an otherwise good year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
