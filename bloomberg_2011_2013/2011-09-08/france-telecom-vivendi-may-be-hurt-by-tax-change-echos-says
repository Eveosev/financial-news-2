France Telecom SA (FTE)  and  Vivendi SA (VIV)  are
among companies that may be hurt by a change in French tax rules
as soon as this year,  Les Echos  reported, citing company
executives and analysts it didnâ€™t name.  Unidentified France Telecom executives told institutional
investors that the company might have to pay between 400 million
euros ($562.8 million) to 600 million euros in French taxman
this year and next, the newspaper reported.  Previously, the phone operator was hoping not to pay taxes
in France this year, and to have to pay 300 million euros to 500
million euros the next year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
