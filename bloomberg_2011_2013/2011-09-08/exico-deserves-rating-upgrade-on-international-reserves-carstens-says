Mexico ’s high level of international
reserves make it deserving of an upgrade from credit ratings
agencies, central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said today.  “I don’t understand why Moody’s has not given us an
upgrade,” Carstens said during a conference hosted by Moody’s
Investors Service in Mexico City, causing laughter in the
audience.  The nation’s international reserves rose to a record $137
billion during the week ended Sept. 2, the central bank reported
Sept. 6. In the year to date, Mexico’s reserves have risen 20.6
percent from $113.6 billion on Dec. 31, according to Bloomberg
data.  In addition to rising international reserves, Mexico has a
flexible  credit line  from the  International Monetary Fund  for
$75 billion and has hedged  oil prices , Carstens said. Tax on oil
sales provides the government with around a third of its
revenue.  The country is in an “optimal position” in regards to
monetary policy, he said.  Mexico’s consumer prices rose 0.16 percent in August from
the month before, below market expectations, the national
statistics agency said today.  ‘Unavoidable’ Global Problems  The bank will reduce its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis
points, or 0.25 percentage point, in October and by another
quarter point in December to end the year at 4 percent,  Alonso Cervera , a Credit Suisse economist, said in a report today.  Banco de Mexico  is the only major Latin America central
bank to keep borrowing costs unchanged in the past year.  Growth in Latin American’s second-biggest economy is being
hindered by “unavoidable” global problems, Carstens said.  In an interview with Mexico City-based Radio Formula
Earlier today, Carstens said Mexican gross domestic product will
grow around 4 percent this year and “a little less than 4
percent next year.”  The central bank reduced its growth forecast to a range of
3.8 percent to 4.8 percent for this year on Aug. 10, down from a
previous estimate of 4 percent to 5 percent. For 2012, the
central bank sees growth of 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent, down
from a previous forecast of 3.8 percent to 4.8 percent.  Mexico’s peso posted its first decline in three days,
weakening 0.4 percent 12.5146 per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. New York
time, from 12.4638 yesterday. The benchmark IPC stock index fell
1.3 percent to 34,712.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
