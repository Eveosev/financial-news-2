The U.S. should not take low
borrowing costs for granted, said  John Lipsky , the International
Monetary Fund’s former no. 2 official and now a special adviser
to the IMF chief.  While the U.S. and  Japan  enjoy “extremely low” bond
yields even with high debt burdens, the debt crisis in the euro
region showed investors can suddenly turn their back on a
country, Lipsky said in a speech in Washington today. The best
way to reassure them is to devise and publish plans on how
governments aim to reduce budget deficits and debt over the
medium term, he said.  “Markets can change their minds, and when they do change
their minds, they tend to do it in a hurry,” said Lipsky, whose
term as first deputy managing director ended Aug. 31. “To
ignore these big problems, even in the biggest economies, would
be a real mistake.”  Congress, which last month agreed to raise the U.S. debt
ceiling, has yet to agree on the specifics of a 10-year deficit-
cutting plan. At the same time, treasuries posted the biggest
monthly gain since December 2008 as investors ignored the first-
ever rating downgrade of the U.S. and sought a refuge in the
safest securities amid signs of slowing global growth.  Lipsky spoke at the presentation of a book by IMF
economists that studies previous fiscal adjustment plans in
advanced economies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
