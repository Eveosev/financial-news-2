Nigeria ’s naira may gain to the
strongest in a month against the dollar in the coming week as
dollar demand at twice-weekly foreign-currency auctions may ebb,
according to BNP Paribas SA.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated to
156.15 per dollar in interbank trading yesterday, the lowest
level on a closing day basis since June 23, after the central
bank failed to meet lenders’ demand for the greenback for a 17th
straight foreign-currency auction. The naira declined 0.2
percent to 153.15 against the dollar at yesterday’s sale, the
weakest level since an auction on June 22.  Nigeria has used foreign-currency reserves to keep the
naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or below 150 naira
per dollar at its bi-weekly auctions to help check inflation.
The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $400 million, compared with
$438.1 million demanded by lenders, the lowest amount requested
since an Aug. 10 sale.  “The oversubscription is usually higher, which makes us
believe that the demand for dollars is about to be satisfied,”
BNP Paribas strategists led by London-based Paul Mortimer-Lee
wrote in an e-mailed note today. “The naira could thus recover
to 153.5 in the coming week as energy companies supply more hard
currency to the banking system.”  That would be the strongest level on a closing basis since
Aug. 10, when it reached 152.99. The naira gained for the first
time in four days, adding 0.4 percent on the  interbank market  to
155.54 per dollar as of 5:15 p.m. in Lagos, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
