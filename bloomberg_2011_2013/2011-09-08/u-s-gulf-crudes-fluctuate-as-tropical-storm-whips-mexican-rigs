almost stopped moving and is bringing winds of 50 miles (80
kilometers) per hour to Petroleos Mexicanos rigs there,
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. BP Plc
said it would evacuate non-essential workers from three
platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
