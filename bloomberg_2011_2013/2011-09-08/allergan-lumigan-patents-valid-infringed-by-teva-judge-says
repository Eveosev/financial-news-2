Allergan Inc.’s patents for the
glaucoma treatment Lumigan are valid and are infringed by
Israel’s  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , a federal judge
ruled today.  Allergan, based in Irvine, California, the maker of
wrinkle-smoothing Botox, sued Teva’s Barr Laboratories unit in
2009 over the two patents and a non-jury trial was held in
January and February, according to court papers.  “Allergan has met its burden” to prove Teva’s proposed
generic Lumigan infringes, and the defendants “have not proven
by clear and convincing evidence” that the patents are
invalid,’’ wrote U.S. District Judge Sue L. Robinson in today’s
opinion released in Wilmington, Delaware.  Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, with $16.1 billion in
sales last year, is the world’s largest generic drugmaker.  Denise Bradley, a U.S. spokeswoman for Teva, said the
company has no comment on the ruling.  The newest of the patents expires in 2014, according to
U.S. Food and Drug Administration records.  Allergan rose 11 cents to $82.53 at 11:33 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Teva’s American depositary
receipts, each representing one ordinary share, fell 84 cents to
$39.49 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  The case is Allergan Inc. v. Barr Laboratories Inc.,
09CV333, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 5,688,819 and 6,403,649.  To contact the reporter on this story:
