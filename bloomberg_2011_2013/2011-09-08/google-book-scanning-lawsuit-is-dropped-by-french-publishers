Three French publishers dropped a
9.8 million-euro ($13.8 million) lawsuit against  Google Inc. (GOOG) 
over books scanned by the search-engine company.  Editions Albin Michel SA, Editions Gallimard SA and
Flammarion made the decision in order to resume negotiations to
reach a deal on scanning copyright-protected works for Google’s
digital library.  “Google suspended negotiations” when the suit was filed,
Brice Amor, Gallimard’s legal director, said today. The
publishers dropped their claims “with the goal that the
negotiations might resume.”  Google, based in Mountain View, California, has reached
agreements with  Lagardere SCA (MMB) ’s Hachette Livre and La Martiniere
Groupe publishers to allow the scanning of out-of-print French
books since losing a copyright dispute with the latter in 2009.  “This is a great news,” Philippe Colombet,  Google Books ’
French director, said today in an e-mail. “We are keen to
discuss constructively and work with publishers around the world
to preserve and disseminate our important cultural treasures,
and to find new business opportunities for authors and
publishers.”  The decision was earlier reported on the website of trade
publication  Livres Hebdo . Calls to Albin Michel and Flammarion
for comment weren’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
