Steel companies have little choice
except to curb output as weakening economic growth and demand
for their products prevents them from passing on surging raw-
material costs to customers, said MEPS International Ltd.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the price of European hot-rolled
coil, a benchmark steel product used in cars and buildings, has
fallen, while the cost of  iron-ore  used to make the metal gains.
ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, said yesterday it
would temporarily close a blast furnace in Eisenhuttenstadt,
 Germany  “until the demand situation supports a re-start.”  “The best support for prices is not to let oversupply
develop,” Peter Fish at Sheffield, England-based metals
consultant MEPS said in an interview. “Production discipline is
really the only tool they have at their disposal.”  Steelmakers’ costs are up 9 percent on the last peak in
2008 and this year will average 40 percent higher than 2010,
Citigroup Inc. says. Input costs have more than doubled since
2005, with an almost threefold jump in iron ore and coking coal
fees. Steel prices are set for a second straight quarterly drop
and down 17 percent from a two-year high touched in February.  ArcelorMittal (MT)  yesterday said it fired 5 percent of workers
at a plant in the Brazilian state of  Minas Gerais  because of
rising raw material costs, an appreciating currency and taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
