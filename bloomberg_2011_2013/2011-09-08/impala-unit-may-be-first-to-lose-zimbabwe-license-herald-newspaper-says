Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  unit
 Zimplats Holdings Ltd. (ZIM)  may be the first mining company to lose
its operating license in Zimbabwe under a new law, the state-
controlled   Herald  reported, citing indigenization minister
Saviour Kasukuwere.  Over 50 foreign-owned miners in Zimbabwe may lose their
licenses because they haven’t submitted acceptable proposals to
show how they will sell a 51 percent stake in their assets to
black Zimbabweans, the Herald reported said, citing Kasukuwere.
No one was available for comment at Impala’s head office in
Johannesburg when Bloomberg called today.  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP) , which runs the Mimosa platinum mine
in Zimbabwe in a venture with Impala,  New Dawn Mining Corp. (ND)  and
 Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) ’s Murowa diamond mine have submitted proposals
that will be considered by Kasukuwere in the next 14 days, the
Herald added. Kasukuwere also rejected proposals from the local
units of Cargill Inc,  Nestle SA (NESN) , Barclays Plc, Standard
Chartered Bank Plc and Standard Bank Group, the Herald reported.  Kasukuwere and Finance Minister Tendai Biti will together
decide whether the 51 percent black-ownership threshold should
apply to foreign-owned banks, the Harare-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
