U.S. stock futures retreated after
the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged and investors waited for President Barack Obama and
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke to speak on the
economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring this
month lost 0.3 percent to 1,195.6 at 7:52 a.m. in New York.  “People are desperate for help and the ECB stuck to their
guns and that disappointed some,” Peter Boockvar, an equity
strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, wrote in an e-
mail.  ECB officials meeting in Frankfurt today kept the benchmark
rate at 1.5 percent, as predicted by all 57 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. President Jean-Claude Trichet may say
inflation risks are no longer on the upside, signaling rates are
now on hold after two increases this year, economists said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
