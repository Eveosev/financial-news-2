Southern Somalia, where the United
Nations has declared a famine in six regions, may receive normal
or above-normal rainfall in the September to December period,
the World Meteorological Organization said.  In parts of the Horn of Africa, in which rainfall in the
four-month period is a “relatively small” proportion of the
annual total, there “may not yet be much easing of the drought
situation in these areas where drought conditions have prevailed
for the past several months,” the Geneva-based organization
said on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
