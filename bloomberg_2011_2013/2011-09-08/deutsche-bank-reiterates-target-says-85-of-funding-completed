Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s biggest
bank, said it can still reach its full-year operating pretax
profit target of 10 billion euros ($14 billion) if European
capital markets and the sovereign debt crisis improve.  “The earnings target is still achievable but predicated on
a recovery in European capital markets and progress with regards
to a solution of the European debt crisis,” Chief Executive
Officer  Josef Ackermann  said in an investor  presentation 
published on the bank’s website today. There are “considerable
near-term uncertainties in the  euro zone , in the world economy,
in financial markets, and in the new regulatory environment.”  Deutsche Bank rose as much as 6.5 percent to 26.18 euros in
Frankfurt trading today, its biggest daily gain since May 10,
2010 after reiterating the goal. Analysts estimate full-year
pretax profit of 8.2 billion euros, according to Bloomberg data.
European banking shares this week plunged and the cost of
insuring their debt increased to record levels amid concern
about sovereign debt contagion and slowing economic growth.  “Lower funding requirements and diversification of funding
sources support our stable funding outlook,” Ackermann said
according to the presentation. The bank completed 85 percent of
its funding plan by the end of August, or 22 billion euros of
its goal of 26 billion euros, the German lender said.  The shares gained 4.2 percent to 25.60 euros at 1:05 p.m.,
valuing the bank at 23.8 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
