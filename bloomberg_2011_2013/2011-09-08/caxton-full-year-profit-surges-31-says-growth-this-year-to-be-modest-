Caxton & CTP Publishers & Printers
Ltd. said fiscal full-year net income increased to 463 million
rand compared with 354.1 million rand.  Revenue rose to 4.34 billion rand in the 12 months through
June compared with 4.1 billion rand a year earlier,
Johannesburg-based Caxton said in a statement in the Business
Day newspaper. Earnings growth is “likely to be modest”
because of volatile economic conditions and a drop in South
African employment and consumer confidence, Caxton said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
