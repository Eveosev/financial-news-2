President  Dmitry Medvedev  demanded
“radical changes” in  Russia ’s civil aviation after a passenger
plane carrying the three-time national champion Lokomotiv
Yaroslavl hockey team crashed yesterday, killing 43 of the 45
people on board.  The number of airlines must be reduced dramatically, and
the remaining carriers must be adequately funded, Medvedev said
today at the crash site in the Yaroslavl region, about 300
kilometers (185 miles) northwest of Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
