Benjamin Steinbruch offered to acquire a 26 percent stake in
 Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA (USIM5)  from Camargo Correa SA
and Votorantim Participacoes SA, O Estado de S. Paulo reported,
citing unidentified people involved in the process.  Camargo and Votorantim haven’t yet responded to the offer,
made several weeks ago, the newspaper said. The two shareholders
have informed  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , which also holds a stake in
Usiminas, of the proposal, O Estado said. The value of the
proposed transaction was not disclosed, according to O Estado.  Camargo and Votorantim declined to comment, O Estado said.
