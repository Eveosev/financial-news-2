Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) ’s Peruvian unit, seeking a five-year labor accord, plans to
hold government-brokered talks with copper miners tomorrow to
avoid a strike called for Sept. 14, a union official said.  Workers at Freeport’s  Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde SAA (CVERDEC1)  unit,
Peru’s third-largest copper producer, are demanding a 9 percent
annual wage rise, union General Secretary Leoncio Amudio said.
Cerro Verde is offering a one-time bonus of 1,200 soles ($705),
he said. Employees are in the second day of a 48-hour strike.  “We would be more flexible if prices were low and the
company was in trouble, but that’s not the case,” Amudio said
today in a telephone interview. “The company is trying to break
the union by pushing for a five-year deal.”  Copper yesterday rose the most in more than a week as
threats of mine strikes heightened concern that a global
shortfall of the metal will increase. Workers at Freeport’s
Grasberg mine in Indonesia also may strike starting Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
