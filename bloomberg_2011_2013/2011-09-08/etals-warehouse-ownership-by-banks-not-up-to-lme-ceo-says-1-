The ownership of metals warehouses
can’t be dictated by the London Metal Exchange, Martin Abbott,
chief executive officer of the exchange, said.  “Anyone who thinks that bank ownership of warehouses is a
problem just doesn’t get it,” Abbott said in an interview at a
conference in Paris. “We can’t stop any company from owning a
warehouse. We can’t dictate who owns warehouses.”  The LME audits how metal is removed from warehouses, he
said. “We have a huge transparency,” he said. “I don’t think
we have a problem with regulations.”  Novelis Inc., a U.S. producer of rolled aluminum, sent a
letter on Aug. 17 to the LME about the ownership, Nick Madden,
chief procurement officer, said today. “We have concerns now
about banks owning warehouses,” he said. “The warehouses should
not be allowed to make incentive payments,” Madden said.  Payments by warehouses to get metal to their location
is a “commercial arrangement in a free market,” Abbott said.
Restricting ownership of warehouses by banks “will be
anticompetitive,” he said. “We need well-financed owners of the
infrastructure,” he said, adding there is no evidence the
ownership of warehouses by financial institutions is changing
the market dynamics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
