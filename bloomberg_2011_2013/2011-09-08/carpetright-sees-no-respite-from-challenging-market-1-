Carpetright Plc (CPR) , the U.K.’s biggest
carpet retailer, sees no respite from the challenging economic
environment over the next year, Chairman Philip Harris said.  “In the year to April 30, 2011, we continued to experience
challenging market conditions with fragile  consumer confidence 
producing a weak floor coverings market,” Harris said today in
a regulatory statement. “The Group remained profitable and
generated cash, although profits for the year reduced
substantially.”  In June, the company said it didn’t expect to see a
recovery in British consumer demand for two years as high
inflation and stagnant wages leave people with little money to
spend. U.K. consumer sentiment fell for a third month in August
as households grew more pessimistic about the outlook for
 Europe ’s second-largest economy, a report by GfK NOP Ltd. said
Aug. 31.  Carpetright last month reported a 1.5 percent decline in
sales for the 12 weeks to July 23.  Carpetright shares fell 0.1 percent to 517 pence at 8:30
a.m. in London giving the Purfleet, Essex-based company a market
value of 348 million pounds ($555 million). The stock has fallen
35 percent this year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
