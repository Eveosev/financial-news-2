Airbus SAS, the world’s biggest
commercial planemaker, expects to buy 5 percent to 10 percent
more aluminum in 2012 on strong demand for aircraft, said Elmar
Luetjen, the company’s head of procurement, materials aluminum.  “Next year we are absolutely confident in our demand
planning,” Luetjen said in an interview at a Metal Bulletin
conference in Paris. “For the years to come, we have a strong
order book.”  Toulouse, France-based Airbus hasn’t been affected by
supply issues, Luetjen said. The London Metal Exchange announced
in July plans to double the amount of metal required to be
delivered from the biggest stockpiles to ease a backlog in
 Detroit , home to a quarter of global stockpiles.  “Airbus is covered by our long-term contracts so these
short-term up and downs in the market have no effect on our
pricing,” Luetjen said.  Airbus, which has produced the most commercial planes every
year since 2003, handed over 258 planes to customers this year
through June, it said in July.  Aluminum accounts for about 75 percent of the weight of an
aircraft such as Airbus’s A330 model, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
