360buy.com, an e-commerce company in
 China , will interview banks next week in preparation for a U.S.
initial public offering in 2012, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  360buy will hold the so-called bake-off on Sept. 15 and 16
in  Hong Kong , letting bankers make a case for why they should
underwrite the deal, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  The Beijing-based company faces an increasingly sluggish
market for IPOs, and many Chinese technology companies have seen
their stocks slump in the U.S. this year. Shares of Renren Inc.,
a social network similar to  Facebook  Inc., have dropped 50
percent on the New York Stock Exchange since their IPO in May.
Tudou Holdings Ltd.’s stock has declined 16 percent since its
offering on the Nasdaq Stock Market last month.  Standard & Poor’s Aug. 5 downgrade of the U.S. credit
rating rattled global markets, prompting many companies to put
their deals on hold. At least 24 U.S. IPOs seeking a total of
more than $3.4 billion have been shelved or scrapped in the
three months ended Sept. 6, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the most since the same period in 2004, when
28 IPOs were withdrawn or postponed.  If market conditions allow it, 360buy aims to go public in
second quarter of next year, said one of the people. Dangdang
Inc., a 360buy rival that went public last year, has lost 73
percent of its value this year.  Li Jing, a spokeswoman at 360buy, declined to comment.  In April, 360buy raised $1.5 billion from six funds and
individual investors, including  Russia ’s Digital Sky
Technologies and Tiger Fund. Digital Sky, which is also a
shareholder in Facebook, invested $500 million in 360buy. The
Chinese company has put the money toward logistics, letting it
speed the delivery of goods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
