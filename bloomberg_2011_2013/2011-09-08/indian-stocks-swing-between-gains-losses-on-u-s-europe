Indian stocks swung between gains
and losses before two key speeches on the U.S. economy today and
on speculation Europe’s debt crisis may ease.  Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  fell after the country’s national auditor
said yesterday that the world’s largest producer of the fuel is
operating 191 old mines without environmental approval.
 Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JPA)  fell after the company denied a media
report that it wants to sell a stake in a cement unit.  The BSE India Sensitive Index declines 0.2 percent to
17,030.59 after fluctuating between gains and losses at least
three times. The gauge yesterday climbed to its highest level in
four weeks. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange of India fell 0.3 percent to 5,109.5.  U.S. President Barack Obama may unveil today a proposal to
inject more than $300 billion into the economy next year, mostly
through tax cuts, infrastructure spending and direct aid to
state and local governments. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will speak in Minneapolis. Italian Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi won a confidence vote on austerity measures
and Germany’s top court rejected challenges to the nations’
participation in euro-rescue funds, easing concern about
Europe’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
