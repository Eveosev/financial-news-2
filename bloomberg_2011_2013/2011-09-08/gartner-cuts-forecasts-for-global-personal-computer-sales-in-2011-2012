Global personal-computer shipments
will increase less than previously predicted this year and next
as consumers curb spending, research firm  Gartner Inc. (IT)  said.  Shipments will rise 3.8 percent to 364 million units in
2011, compared with an earlier projection of 9.3 percent, the
Stamford, Connecticut-based company  said today  on its website.
Shipments will probably increase 10.9 percent in 2012, compared
with an earlier forecast of 12.8 percent, Gartner said.  “An increasing pessimistic economic outlook is causing
both consumer and business sentiment to deteriorate” in the
U.S. and Western Europe, Ranjit Atwal, a research director at
Gartner, said in the statement.  Younger consumers aren’t buying PCs as their first or main
device, Atwal said. Tablets and mobile devices have cut into PC
demand, and  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ’s possible sale or spinoff of
its PC division shows the traditional business models are
failing, said George Shiffler, also a research director at
Gartner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
