The rate London-based banks say they
can borrow at in Swiss francs for three months was unchanged at
0.005 percent for a second day, the British Bankers’ Association
said.  The rate fell to a record low 0.00333 percent on Sept. 5,
BBA data show. No lender among a panel of 12 contributors
submitted a rate below zero, the data show.  The  Swiss National Bank  lowered its target for three-month
franc Libor to “as close to zero as possible” on Aug. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
