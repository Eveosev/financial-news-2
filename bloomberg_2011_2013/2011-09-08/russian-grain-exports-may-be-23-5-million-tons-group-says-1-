Russia may export 23.5 million
metric tons of grain in the 12 months that started July 1,
according to the country’s Grain Union.  The national grain crop may come to 90.3 million tons, with
domestic consumption forecast at 69 million tons, union
President Arkady Zlochevsky said at a conference in Moscow
today. That would leave 25.2 million tons of stockpiles at the
end of the season, an “excessive” amount by United Nations
recommendations, Zlochevsky said.  Russian traders are exporting record amounts of grain after
the government let a ban on overseas deliveries expire July 1.
It barred exports in August 2010 after a drought decimated the
country’s crop. The national crop may come to between 87 million
and 90 million tons, against 60.9 million tons in 2010,
according to the Agriculture Ministry.  Russian grain exports may come to 20 million tons, Dmitry
Rylko, director of the Moscow-based institute for Agricultural
Market Studies, also known as IKAR, told the conference. Russia
may sell 22 million tons of grain abroad, said Vladimir
Petrichenko, director of consultancy OOO ProZerno.  The country will export 18 million tons of grain in the
2011-12 season, 2 million tons more than previously forecast,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s attache in Moscow said.
That would restore Russia’s position as the third-largest
exporter after the U.S. and Australia, according to USDA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
