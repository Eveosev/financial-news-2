Iraq  is seeking about $30 billion of
investments to build five oil refineries as OPEC’s third-largest
crude producer plans to add enough fuel-processing capacity to
avoid importing gasoline and diesel.  The projects would raise Iraq’s capacity to transform crude
into fuels by 900,000 barrels a day, the country’s Deputy Oil
Minister Ahmed al-Shamma said today at the Iraq Mining 2011
conference in London.  Iraq, which generates most of its revenue by exporting oil,
imports about 30 percent of the gasoline it uses, according to
U.S.  Energy Information Administration  data. The country is
seeking foreign investors to build the refineries and develop
oil and gas fields to boost output.  The nation imports about 10 million liters of gasoline each
day to meet domestic demand, al-Shamma said. It is the only
member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries not
held to a production quota.  Four refineries planned for Kirkuk, Maysan, Nassiriyah and
Karbala are in design and engineering stages and would together
add 750,000 barrels a day of capacity. In addition, a proposed
150,000 barrel-a-day facility at Nineveh is at a provisional
phase and would refine heavy crude once production starts at
nearby fields, al-Shamma said.  The government also wants to add 70,000 barrels a day of
capacity at an existing refinery in Basra in the country’s south
early next year, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
