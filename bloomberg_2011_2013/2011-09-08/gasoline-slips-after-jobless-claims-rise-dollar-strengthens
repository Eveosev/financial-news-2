Gasoline declined after a Labor
Department report showed applications in the U.S. for
 unemployment benefits  rose and the dollar strengthened against
the euro, reducing the appeal of commodities as an investment.  Futures dropped 0.8 percent after the Labor Department
reported that jobless claims unexpectedly increased last week.
The dollar rose versus the euro as European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said “downside risks” to the
euro-area economy have intensified, signaling the bank may keep
 interest rates  on hold in the coming months. Inventories of the
fuel also unexpectedly rose.  Jobless claims “were obviously not good,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in Chicago. “The
other issue is Trichet backing off the tightening cycle, which
made the euro weaker.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 2.28 cents to settle at
$2.8852 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Jobless claims rose by 2,000 to 414,000 in the week ended
Sept. 3, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a drop in claims
to 405,000, according to the median forecast.  The euro sank 1.4 percent versus the dollar at 3:34 p.m. in
New York after Trichet said inflation risks are balanced, and no
longer to the upside.  Total U.S. gasoline inventories rose 199,000 barrels to
208.8 million last week, the Energy Department reported.
Analysts forecast a drop of 1.4 million, according to the median
estimate of a Bloomberg survey.  Stockpiles of heating oil and diesel increased 709,000
barrels to 156.8 million in the week ended Sept. 2, according to
the government report.  Heating oil for October delivery dropped 3.13 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.0443 a gallon.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.2
cent to $3.655 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. It’s
the third straight price decrease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
