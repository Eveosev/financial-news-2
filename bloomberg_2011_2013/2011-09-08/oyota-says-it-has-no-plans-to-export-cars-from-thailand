(Corrects to show denial refers to exports to  Japan  from
 Thailand  in first paragraph.)  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest
automaker, said it has no plans to start exporting cars from
Thailand to Japan, denying a report in the Wall Street Journal.  “Right now, Toyota has no plans of exporting subcompacts
or any cars from Thailand to Japan,” Keisuke Kirimoto, a
spokesman for the company, said by phone today.  The automaker has said it plans to get half its global auto
sales from emerging markets by 2015, compared with about 40
percent last year. As part of its focus on faster-growing
economies, Toyota added the Etios compact in India in December
and is readying the small car for sale in  China , Thailand and
Brazil.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that Toyota
may begin exporting subcompacts from Thailand to markets
including Japan, citing Executive Vice President Yukitoshi Funo.  Importing cars into Japan would also be inconsistent with
the company’s strategy to produce at least 3 million cars in the
country, Kirimoto said.  Toyota rose 0.8 percent to 2,700 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
Tokyo trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
