The U.K. should lose its top AAA
credit rating and be cut by four notches to A+, the same as
Standard & Poor’s rates Italy and Slovakia, as the economy slows
and government debt levels rise more than expected, according to
Danske Bank A/S.  “A downgrade of the U.K. could in our view happen in 2012
and we believe it can remain a market theme into 2013,” Danske
Bank analysts  John Hydeskov  and Hugo Railing said in a report
dated yesterday. “It would of course create a lot of public
furor and cause U.K. politicians to criticize rating agencies,
but it would not lead to a huge gilt sell-off and we believe
there would still be plenty of demand for British debt.”  S&P, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings have all
assigned the U.K. the top grade with stable outlooks, indicating
a change soon isn’t likely. The  Office for Budget
Responsibility , which oversees U.K. Treasury forecasts, sees
government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product
peaking at 71 percent in the fiscal year 2013-2014, before
easing in the coming years.  “We disagree with the OBR’s underlying assumptions about
the debt-burden projection,” Hydeskov and Railing wrote in the
e-mailed report. “Real growth could in our view be
substantially lower” and “the U.K. debt burden will rise in
the years to come because of the still-sizable public deficit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
