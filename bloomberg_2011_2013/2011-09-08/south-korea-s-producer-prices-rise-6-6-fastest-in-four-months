South Korea ’s producer prices rose
at the fastest pace in four months as food costs climbed.  Prices gained 6.6 percent in August from a year earlier,
after a 6.5 percent gain in July, the Bank of  Korea  said in a
statement in Seoul today. They increased 0.3 percent from July.  Central banks in South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines
held off from raising borrowing costs yesterday as risks from a
global slowdown outweighed concern that inflation would
accelerate. The Bank of Korea can’t resume rate increases until
“external” conditions look to be under control, Governor Kim
Choong Soo said after the decision.  Consumer prices in South Korea increased 5.3 percent last
month, the fastest pace in three years, even after policy makers
boosted borrowing costs three times this year and the government
imposed price controls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
