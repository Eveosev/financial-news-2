Colombia ’s peso bonds gained,
sending benchmark yields to record lows, as investors cut their
inflation expectations after consumer prices unexpectedly fell
last month.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.19 percent
at 2:25 p.m. New York time. The bond’s price rose 0.138 centavo
to 123.103 centavos per peso.  “The inflation number is leading people to reduce their
inflation forecasts,” said Pedro Ospina, a bond analyst at
Interbolsa SA, the nation’s biggest brokerage. “Given yields
are at historical lows, they are harder to break but the
declining trend should continue.” He forecasts the yield on the
bond due 2024 will fall to 7.10 percent within two weeks.  Consumer prices fell 0.03 percent in August from the
previous month, according to a government report published Sept.
5. Economists expected a 0.13 percent increase in prices,
according to the median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
Annual inflation slowed to 3.27 percent last month from 3.42
percent in July, within the central bank’s 2 percent to 4
percent inflation target for this year.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 1,788.5 per dollar, from
1,790.59 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
