The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  climbed 0.6
percent to 1,556.46 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index gained 0.3 percent to 1,675.14.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Bashneft (BANE RU) climbed 1 percent to $52, the
strongest level in more than a month. Higher prices and oil-
product sales boosted second-quarter profit 44 percent from the
previous three-month period, the oil producer controlled by
Russian billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov ’s AFK Sistema said.  OAO Polymetal (PMTL RX) jumped the most in a week as the
Russian gold and silver producer was upgraded to “buy” from
“neutral” at UBS AG and gold prices climbed. The shares
advanced 1.6 percent, the biggest gain since Aug. 30, to 615.8
rubles.  OAO Sberbank (SBER03 RX),  Russia ’s largest lender, climbed
2.1 percent to 85.49 rubles, its strongest close in three weeks.
Sberbank agreed to buy Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG’s eastern
European operations for 585 million euros ($823 million) to 645
million euros, the Austrian lender said in a regulatory filing
today. The Moscow-based lender initially agreed to pay 670
million euros and lowered the offer price after European bank
shares plummeted, three people with knowledge of the
negotiations said last month, declining to be identified because
the talks are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
