Monsson Alma SRL, a Romanian private
equity company, plans to invest about 240 million euros ($338
million) in a wind park in the south-eastern county of
Constanta,  Ziarul Financiar  said, citing unidentified people.  Monsson will start building a 150 megawatt wind park in the
north of Constanta county and plans to buy the turbines from
Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the Bucharest-based newspaper reported.  As of the end of June, Vestas had installed 119 turbines in
 Romania , equivalent to 329 megawatts, according to Michael Holm,
a spokesman for the largest wind-turbine maker. The company
opened an office in Bucharest in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
