Penta Investments Ltd., a Czech
private equity group, and E-Invest, led by investor Martin
Ulcak, will bid for bankrupt Czech lottery company Sazka AS.  Penta and E-Invest will lodge their bids with a solicitor
rather than submit them to the lottery operator’s administrator,
Josef Cupka, as required by the tender rules, said Penta partner
Marek Dospiva and Ulcak at a joint press conference in  Prague 
today.  Penta and E-Invest will also lodge the amount offered to
Komercni Banka AS rather than to the bank named by the
administrator and ask Cupka to open and assess their offers,
they said. The administrator requires a 500 million-koruna ($28
million) deposit from each bidder before due diligence on the
Sazka can begin.  “If Penta fails to proceed with their offer according to
tender rules, we will consider their bid irrelevant,” Sazka
administrator spokeswoman Lenka Ticha said by phone today.  The administrator should issue a further statement later
today, she said.  The Prague Municipal Court put Sazka into bankruptcy in May
after it breached covenants on bonds issued to finance the
construction of the 02 Arena, which hosted the World Hockey
Championship in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
