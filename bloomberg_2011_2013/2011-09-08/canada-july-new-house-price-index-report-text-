The following is the text of
the new house price index report for July released by
Statistics Canada.  The New Housing Price Index (NHPI) rose 0.1% in July,
following a 0.3% advance in June.  The metropolitan region of Toronto and Oshawa was the
top contributor to the increase in July.  Between June and July, Charlottetown (+1.3%) posted the
largest increase followed by Toronto and Oshawa (+0.4%).  In Charlottetown, the price increases were primarily
the result of some builders re-evaluating their current
prices and others moving to new phases of development.
Builders in the metropolitan region of Toronto and Oshawa
cited good market conditions as the main reason for the
price increase.  In July, prices remained unchanged in 6 of the 21
metropolitan regions surveyed.  The most significant monthly price decline was recorded
in Calgary (-0.5%), as some builders offered free upgrade
packages and promotional pricing to generate sales.  Year over year, the NHPI was up 2.3% in July following
a 2.1% increase in June. The main contributors to the
advance in July were the metropolitan regions of Toronto
and Oshawa as well as Montreal.  The largest year-over-year price increase was in
Toronto and Oshawa (+5.2%) followed by Winnipeg (+4.3%).  Compared with July 2010, contractors' selling prices
were also higher in St. John's (+4.1%), Regina (+3.9%),
Montreal (+3.3%) and Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo (+3.1%).  Among the 21 metropolitan regions surveyed, 5 posted 
12-month price declines in July, led by Windsor (-2.7%) and
Victoria (-1.6%).  Note: The New Housing Price Index measures changes over
time in the selling prices of new residential houses
agreed upon between the contractor and the buyer at the
time of the signing of the contract. It is designed to
measure the changes in the selling prices of new houses
where detailed specifications pertaining to each house
remain the same between two consecutive periods. The
prices collected from builders and included in the index
are market selling prices less value added taxes, such as
the Federal Goods and Services Tax or the Harmonized Sales
Tax.  This release presents data that are not seasonally
adjusted and the indexes published are final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
