Former U.S. presidential candidate
John Edwards, accused of accepting illegal campaign
contributions to hide an extramarital affair, had his trial
moved to January from October.  U.S. Chief District Judge James A. Beaty Jr. in Winston-
Salem, North Carolina, yesterday granted a request by Edwards to
postpone the trial because of the volume of material that must
be reviewed.  “A continuance is necessary in order to ensure defendant
adequate time for preparation for trial, given the circumstances
in this case, particularly the unusually large volume of
discovery to be reviewed,” Beaty said.  Edwards, who was Democrat John Kerry’s running mate in the
2004 election, was the subject of a two-year investigation into
whether he used more than $925,000 in contributions to conceal
his relationship with filmmaker Rielle Hunter.  The former North Carolina senator on Sept 6 sought to
dismiss the charges, saying prosecutors abused their authority
and that the grand jury proceedings were flawed and the
indictment failed to state an actual crime. Beaty delayed until
January consideration of Edwards’s request to dismiss the case  The case is U.S. v. Edwards, 11-00161, U.S. District Court,
Middle District of North Carolina (Greensboro).  To contact the reporter on this story:
