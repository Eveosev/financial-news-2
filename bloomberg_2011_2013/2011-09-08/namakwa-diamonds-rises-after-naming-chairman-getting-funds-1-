Namakwa Diamonds Ltd. (NAD) , a miner of
the gems in Africa, jumped the most in 2 1/2 years in London
trading after naming a chairman and reaching a funding accord.  Namakwa climbed 2.75 pence, or 26 percent, to 13.25 pence
at the 4:30 p.m. close, the biggest one-day gain since January
2009. The Johannesburg-based company appointed Edward Haslam as
chairman and named Alex Davidson as senior independent non-
 executive director , it said today in a statement.  The company also said it reached an agreement with
Jarvirne, the investment vehicle of industrialist Eduard
Prutnik, on funding for its kimberlite mining project at Kao in
Lesotho.  To contact the reporter on this story:
