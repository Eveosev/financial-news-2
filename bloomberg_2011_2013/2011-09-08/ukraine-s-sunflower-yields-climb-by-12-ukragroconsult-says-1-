Ukraine’s sunflower yields have
increased by 12 percent so far this year, with a 10th of the
crop harvested, agricultural researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Sunflower yields increased to 1.68 metric tons a hectare
(2.5 acres) as of yesterday, up from 1.5 tons a hectare a year
earlier, the Kiev, Ukraine-based researcher wrote in an e-mailed
statement today.  Farmers have reaped sunflowers from 466,000 hectares, the
researcher said. UkrAgroConsult raised its sunflower seed
harvest forecast to 8.7 million tons from 8.5 million, Serhiy
Feofilov, director at the researcher, said today at a conference
in Moscow.  Ukraine, which processes most of the sunflower seed crop
itself, will probably export a record 2.7 million to 2.8 million
tons of sunflower oil in 2011-2012, Hamburg-based  Oil World  said
in a report on Sept. 6.  The government of the former Soviet state may introduce a
tax for sunflower exports, Vadym Kopylov, first deputy economy
minister, said yesterday. He didn’t give a timeframe or specify
a rate for the potential duty.  A sunflower oil export duty of 10 percent, or no less than
90 euros ($126) a ton, was being discussed, commodities
researcher APK-Inform said on June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
