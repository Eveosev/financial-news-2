American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
and Toyota Motor Credit Corp. extended a rebound in corporate
bond offerings in the U.S. as companies sold $7.1 billion of
debt.  AIG, the bailed-out U.S. insurer, sold $2 billion of bonds
to repay debt and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Torrance, California-
based finance arm issued $2.5 billion of notes, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Borrowers have sold $27.2 billion of
bonds this week, the most since the period ended May 27,
Bloomberg data show.  Issuance is rebounding as investors gain confidence that
companies holding more than $1 trillion in cash can withstand a
slowing economy and  Europe ’s debt crisis, which last month sent
yields tumbling to record lows. Companies raised $17.1 billion
of debt yesterday in the busiest day since May 24, locking in
borrowing costs at about the lowest level on record.  “Corporations are taking advantage of the low yields,”
 Mikhail Foux , a credit strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York,
said in a telephone interview. “Despite the volatility,
everybody’s expecting a pretty robust September.”  Germany ’s Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank sold $1.5 billion
of seven-year notes, Bloomberg data show.  Fluor Corp. (FLR) , the
largest publicly traded U.S. construction company, issued $500
million of 10-year securities, while  Green Bay , Wisconsin-based
Associated Banc-Corp priced $130 million of debt due in March
2016 to help repay a bailout under the U.S. Treasury
Department’s Troubled Asset Relief Program.  Lowest Yields  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds averaged 3.68
percent yesterday, compared with 3.45 percent, the lowest in
daily data extending to October 1986, on Aug. 4, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master index.
They reached 9.3 percent in October 2008, after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy  Companies sold $51.8 billion of bonds in the U.S. in
August, the least since $33.6 billion was issued in May 2010,
Bloomberg data show. Bank of America Corp. strategists forecast
that investment-grade companies may issue $80 billion of debt in
the U.S. this month.  AIG, based in  New York , sold its bonds to refinance debt
used to finance investments including mortgage- and asset-backed
securities, according to a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  The transaction included $1.2 billion of 4.25 percent
three-year notes that yield 412.5 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $800 million of 4.875 percent,
five-year senior debt that pays a 425 basis-point spread,
Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Matched Investment  AIG has about $4.1 billion of bonds coming due in the next
year that were issued to fund the matched investment program,
which is being wound down, it said in the filing.  “One thing that we’re always looking for with AIG is
access to the capital markets,” said  Julie Burke , an analyst at
 Fitch Ratings , which assigns the company a rating of BBB.
“That’s probably more important for AIG at this point than
other companies that might be issuing, because it’s a window
into financial flexibility.”  Toyota Motor Credit issued $1.5 billion of 2 percent, five-
year notes that pay a spread of 125 basis points and $1 billion
of 10-year 3.4 percent debt that yields 145 basis points more
than the benchmark, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
