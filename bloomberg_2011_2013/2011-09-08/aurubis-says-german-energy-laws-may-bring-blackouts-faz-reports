Aurubis AG (NDA)  Chief Executive Officer
Bernd Drouven said Germany’s new energy policy increases the
danger of a prolonged blackout,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported.  The copper company’s melting ovens would be damaged if
liquid metal were allowed to solidify, a process that takes
about eight hours, Drouven said in an interview with the German
newspaper.  The CEO, who said in May he would leave Aurubis at the end
of the year, resigned for personal reasons and doesn’t have a
new job yet, he told FAZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
