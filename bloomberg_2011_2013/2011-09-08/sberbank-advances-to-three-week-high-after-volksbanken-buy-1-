OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, had its best close in more than three weeks after
agreeing to buy Volksbanken AG’s eastern European operations.  Sberbank’s shares climbed 2.1 percent to 85.49 rubles by
6:45 p.m. in Moscow.  Sberbank agreed to buy Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG’s
eastern European operations for 585 million euros ($823 million)
to 645 million euros, the Austrian lender said in a regulatory
filing today.  The Moscow-based lender had initially agreed to pay 670
million euros and lowered the offer price after European bank
shares plummeted, three people with knowledge of the
negotiations said last month, declining to be identified because
the talks are private.  “The price is lower than flagged, which is good for
Sberbank,”  Mark Rubinstein , head of research at Metropol IFC in
Moscow, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
