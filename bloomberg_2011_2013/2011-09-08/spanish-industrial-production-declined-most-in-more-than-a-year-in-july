Spanish  industrial production  fell
the most in more than a year in July as the economy struggled to
emerge from a three-year slump fueled by the region’s debt
crisis.  Output at factories, refineries and mines dropped 2.8
percent from a year earlier, adjusting for the number of working
days, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said today in
an e-mailed statement. That’s the biggest decline since January
2010 and more than the revised 1.9 percent drop in June. Non-
seasonally adjusted output fell 5.7 percent in July from a year
earlier.  Spain ’s 1.3 percent growth target has become “a bit more
difficult” to meet than a quarter ago, Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said on Aug. 19. The nation’s economic recovery slowed
in the second quarter as exports contracted and spending shrank
amid the deepest austerity measures in three decades and a 21
percent unemployment rate.  “We might say that the Spanish industrial sector is
already in recession,”  Julian Callow , chief European economist
at  Barclays Capital  in Londo, said in a note. “Spanish
industrial production has weakened broadly.”  The government has cut public wages, frozen pensions and
axed benefits to reduce the euro-region’s third-largest budget
gap by half in two years.  “Spain’s export-led recovery remains vulnerable to any
global deterioration,” Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero told Parliament on Aug. 23 as he sought lawmakers’
backing for further austerity measures to stem a surge in
borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
