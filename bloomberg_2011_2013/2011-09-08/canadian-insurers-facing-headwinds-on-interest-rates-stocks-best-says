Canada’s life insurance industry,
which has a “stable” rating outlook from A.M. Best Co., may
experience “headwinds” as the companies’ risk profile rises,
analysts for the ratings firm said.  Insurers face pressure from persistent low interest rates,
volatile equity markets and the effect of global contagion, A.M.
Best analysts Stephen Irwin and Raj Shah said.  “When the U.S. sneezes, everybody catches a fever,” Shah
said at a conference today in Toronto.  The analysts said domestic growth opportunities for the
“big three” Canadian insurers of  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Sun
Life Financial Inc. (SLF)  and  Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO)  are somewhat
limited, although the firms may expand in emerging markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
