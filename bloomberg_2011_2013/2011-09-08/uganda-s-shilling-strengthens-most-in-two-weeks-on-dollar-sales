Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s worst
performer against the dollar this year, gained the most in two
weeks as companies bought the local currency to pay for goods.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy
appreciated as much as 0.7 percent to 2,795 per dollar and
traded 0.6 percent up at 2,799 by 3:18 p.m. in the capital,
Kampala, the strongest intraday level since Aug. 25, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There was a bit of interbank selling of the dollar today
to cater for customer needs,” Faisal Bukenya, the head of
 currency trading  at  Barclays Bank  of Uganda, said by phone from
Kampala. “There were also inflows of the dollar to the non-
governmental sector” that needed to be converted into the local
currency, he said.  The shilling has slumped 17 percent this year against the
dollar as a surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a
more than 18-year high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8
percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
