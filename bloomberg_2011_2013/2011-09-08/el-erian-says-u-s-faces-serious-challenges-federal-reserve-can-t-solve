Mohamed El-Erian said the U.S. faces “serious” economic
challenges, including lagging housing and labor markets, that
will prove resistant to  Federal Reserve  stimulus efforts.  “You simply can’t overcome these impediments,” said El-
Erian, chief executive and co-chief investment officer at
 Newport Beach , California-based Pimco, manager of the world’s
biggest bond fund. “These are structural issues and require
structural solutions.”  Responses to financial crises in the U.S. and other
countries “have been too cyclical and too dependent on central
banks,” he said today at a symposium on Asian banking and
finance held at the Federal Reserve Bank of  San Francisco . El-
Erian’s remarks followed a speech today by Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who said policy makers stand ready to take action as
needed to boost the recovery.  “We’re rather surprised at how cyclical the responses have
been,” whether in the U.S. or  Europe , El-Erian told bankers,
regulators and economists gathered at the conference.  The world is undergoing a “historical” realignment akin
to “tectonic plates shifting,” which is focused on balance
sheets, growth dynamics among different countries, and policies
or politics, he said.  “The key issue any risk manager faces today is that too
many parameters have become variables,” El-Erian said. “A
cyclical mindset is not sufficient given the world we live in,”
he said. “ You need to think structurally.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
