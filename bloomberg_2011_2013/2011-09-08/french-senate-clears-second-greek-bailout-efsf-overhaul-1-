France’s Senate, the upper house of
Parliament, cleared a plan to offer Greece more financial aid
and give the euro area’s stability fund more flexibility, the
Budget Ministry said.  The Senate vote tonight in Paris followed approval of the
plan yesterday by the National Assembly, the lower house. French
legislators are the first in Europe to adopt the package, the
Finance Ministry said. The plan was agreed on by European Union
leaders on July 21 in Brussels.  The measures give the European Financial Stability Facility
the power to buy government debt in secondary markets, help
troubled banks and offer credit lines to governments. The plan
also provides 160 billion euros ($222 billion) in a second
bailout to Greece.  “The July 21 summit is historic because it provides a
second support package for Greece” and increases the
flexibility of the fund, Finance Minister Francois Baroin told
lawmakers when introducing the bill earlier this week. “At
France’s side, Germany will soon begin the procedure of adopting
the decisions of the summit.”  Germany’s top court yesterday cleared the way for
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition to participate in the
current euro-area rescue plans, while saying it must seek some
additional parliamentary approval for payouts under the funds.
The Bundestag, Germany’s lower house, will begin debating the
package tomorrow and a vote is scheduled for Sept. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
