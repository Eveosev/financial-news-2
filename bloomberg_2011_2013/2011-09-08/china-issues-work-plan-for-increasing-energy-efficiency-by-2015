China , the world’s biggest polluter,
issued a working plan for boosting the efficiency with which the
nation uses coal, oil and other energy to fuel its economy.  The plan, which consolidates targets for different regions,
was issued by the State Council and reiterates the nation’s main
goal to reduce energy consumption by 16 percent for every
10,000-yuan unit of gross domestic product by 2015 as compared
with five years earlier. That would save the equivalent of 670
million tons of coal for the five years through 2015, the
council, China’s cabinet, said on its  website  yesterday.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  has made reducing pollution, narrowing
the wealth gap, and lessening other side effects of China’s
economic growth priorities as the nation seeks to diminish
sources of social unrest. China set a lower growth target in its
so-called 12th Five-Year Plan for the period from this year
through 2015 in a bid to create a more sustainable economy.  Coal currently accounts for about 70 percent of China’s
energy consumption. The nation, the world’s second-biggest
economy, is also the largest consumer of energy.  The nation will limit the growth of high-energy-consuming
and high-polluting industries in the five years through 2015,
according the plan issued by the State Council. China also aims
to derive 11.4 percent of energy from non-fossil fuels by 2015.  The plan assigns the coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu
and Guangdong and the municipalities of Shanghai and Tianjin
targets to cut energy consumption by 18 percent for every unit
of GDP by 2015, 2 percentage points more than the nation goal.  From 2005 to 2010, China reduced its energy use by 19
percent for every unit of GDP, the State Council said.  --Penny Peng. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
