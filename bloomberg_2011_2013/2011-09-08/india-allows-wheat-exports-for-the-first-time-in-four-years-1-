India , the second-biggest grower of
wheat, allowed private companies to export the grain for the
first time in four years, Food Minister K.V. Thomas said.  A panel of ministers permitted overseas sales of 2 million
metric tons of wheat and 2.1 million tons of non-basmati rice,
Thomas told reporters after a meeting today. The exports will be
halted once the specified amounts are shipped, he said.  Grain supplies from India may further cool global food
prices tracked by the  United Nations  that dropped to 231.1
points in August on lower prices of cooking oils and dairy
products. Higher grain prices limited the food-price gauge’s
drop as an index of cereal prices climbed last month from July.
The gauge was at an all-time high of 237.7 points in February.  India banned private companies from shipping wheat in early
2007 and non-basmati rice in April 2008 to bolster domestic
supplies amid a global food crisis. Restrictions were eased
allowing some quantities of wheat, rice and wheat products to be
shipped to  Africa , as well as Bangladesh and Nepal through
state-run companies under government-to-government deals.  The panel on July 11 put off a decision to end the ban on
wheat exports, while approving shipments of 1 million tons of
non-basmati rice.  Shares Gain  Shares of Kohinoor Foods Ltd. and other rice exporters
gained today in Mumbai trading as exports may boost profits.
Kohinoor advanced 7.3 percent to 42.55 rupees (92 cents), KRBL
Ltd. surged 4.6 percent to 27.15 rupees and LT Foods Ltd.
climbed 3.6 percent to 46.4 rupees.  Group of 20 farm ministers, including India’s, agreed June
23 to increase agriculture output, set up a crops database and
limit export bans to tackle what French President  Nicolas
Sarkozy  called the “plague” of rising food prices. Higher food
expenses have pushed 44 million more people into poverty since
June last year, the World Bank estimates.  Wheat exports from India may accelerate the decline in
wheat futures in  Chicago  this year after the International
Grains Council forecast increased supplies. World wheat
production will rise to 677.1 million tons in the year through
June 2012, the London-based Council said Aug. 25.  December-delivery wheat dropped as much as 2 percent to
$7.365 a bushel on Chicago Board of Trade. Rough-rice futures
for November delivery in Chicago declined as much as 2.7 percent
to $17.66 for 100 pounds.  India likely harvested a record 85.93 million tons of wheat
in the year ended June 30, a 6.3 percent increase from a year
earlier, while rice output totaled 95.32 million tons, up from
89.1 million tons, Agriculture Secretary P.K. Basu said July 19.  The government, which buys grains from farmers at assured
prices and sells to the poor at cheaper-than-market rates, had
stockpiles of 33.62 million tons of wheat as of Sept. 1, up
almost 13 percent from a year earlier, while rice reserves were
22.71 million tons, according to Food Corp. of India data on its
website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
