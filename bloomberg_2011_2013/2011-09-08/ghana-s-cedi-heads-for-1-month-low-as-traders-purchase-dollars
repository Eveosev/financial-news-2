Ghana’s cedi headed for its lowest
in almost a month against the dollar as traders bought the U.S.
currency to import goods for resale and manufacturers sought
dollars to bring raw materials into the West African nation.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
weakened 0.5 percent to 1.5390 per dollar as of 1:05 p.m. in
Accra, the capital. A close at this level will be the lowest
since Aug. 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Today we saw dollar demand from the commerce industry,
who import goods from abroad, as well as the manufacturing
industry,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the local unit
of Barclays Bank Plc said in a telephone interview. “The market
did not get much supply today.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
