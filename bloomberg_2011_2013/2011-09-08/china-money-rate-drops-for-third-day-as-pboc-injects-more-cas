China ’s money-market rate dropped
for a third day on speculation increased injections of funds by
the central bank will help ease a cash crunch.  A total of 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) was added to
the financial system this week, compared with 25 billion yuan
last week, according to Pin Ru Tan, a strategist at HSBC
Securities Asia Ltd. in  Hong Kong .  “The Central Bank conducted a bigger net injection of
liquidity this week and that has contributed to easier liquidity
conditions,” Tan said. “As we head towards banks’ quarter-end
accounting, liquidity conditions are likely to tighten again.”  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 35 basis points to 4.00 percent as
of 4:35 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  Banks will hoard cash before the one-week long National Day
holidays next month, putting pressure on liquidity, according to
Chen Liang, a bond analyst at Sealand Securities Co. in Shenzhen.
Financial markets in China will be closed from Oct. 3 to Oct. 7
for the National Day holiday.  The yield on the 3.94 percent government bonds due January
2021 fell two basis points to 4.06 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. The one-year swap contract, the fixed
cost needed to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.31 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
