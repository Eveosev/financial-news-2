Oil dropped for a second day in  New
York , trimming a third week of gains, as investors bet that
signs of a slowing U.S. economy indicate fuel demand will falter
in the world’s biggest crude consumer.  Futures slid as much as 0.7 percent after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the economic recovery is fragile.
An Energy Department report showed gasoline stockpiles climbed
199,000 barrels last week, compared with an analyst forecast for
a 1.4 million barrel decline. Tropical Storm Nate is forecast to
become a hurricane today in the  Gulf of Mexico , the National
Hurricane Center said.  Crude for October delivery fell as much as 65 cents to
$88.40 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $88.58 at 9 a.m. Sydney time. The contract
yesterday slipped 29 cents to $89.05. Prices are 2.5 percent
higher this week and up 19 percent the past year.  Brent oil for October settlement decreased $1.25, or 1.1
percent, to $114.55 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe Exchange yesterday. The European benchmark contract
closed at a premium of $25.50 to U.S. futures, compared with a
record settlement of $26.87 on Sept. 6.  Fed policy makers will discuss the tools they could use to
boost the economic recovery at their next meeting this month,
Bernanke told economists in a speech in  Minneapolis  yesterday.
U.S. equities fell after he failed to give specific plans. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 1.1 percent at 4 p.m. in New
York.  Growth, Stockpiles  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
cut growth forecasts yesterday for the U.S. and  Japan , the
largest and third-largest oil-consuming countries.  China  is the
second-biggest user of crude.  U.S. crude stockpiles fell 3.96 million barrels to 353.1
million, the Energy Department report showed. They were forecast
to drop 2 million barrels, according to the median estimate of
14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Nate’s top winds are 70 miles (113 kilometers) per hour,
just under the threshold of 74 mph needed to be a hurricane,
according to an advisory from the U.S. National Hurricane Center
at 5 p.m. East Coast time. The storm has been lashing Petroleos
Mexicanos rigs in the Bay of Campeche and its final track is
still in question.  To contact the reporter on this story:
