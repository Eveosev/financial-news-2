The Philippine peso fell the most in
a month on speculation the central bank will loosen restrictions
on dollar purchases to help stem appreciation that poses a risk
to exports.  Policy makers may further liberalize currency rules,
including allowing companies with dollar requirements to buy
without obtaining prior approval from the regulator, Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said this week.
The measures will increase demand for the U.S. currency and help
temper gains in the peso “to a certain extent,” he said.  “The market may be anticipating that the central bank will
issue some rules,” said Roland Avante, treasurer at Sterling
Bank of Asia in Manila.  The peso fell 0.4 percent to 42.405 per dollar at the noon
trading break in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. That’s
the biggest drop since Aug. 5. Trading resumes at 2:30 p.m.  The yield on 8 percent bonds due July 2031 fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percent, to 7.23 percent, according to
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.’s fixing rate. It fell to
7.22 percent on Sept. 6, the lowest for a benchmark 20-year note
since Bloomberg started the data in 1998.  The central bank will keep its overnight borrowing rate
unchanged at 4.5 percent for a third straight meeting today,
according to all 15 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
