Canal Plus SA, the pay-tv company
which has agreed to buy 60 percent of  Bollore (BOL) ’s television
assets, may raise that holding to 100 percent,  Les Echos 
reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer
Bertrand Maheut.  “We have an option that can be exercised three years from
now,” he said, according to the daily newspaper. Canal Plus
will pay 279 million euros for its 60 percent holding, Les Echos
said, a price Maheut described as “legitimate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
