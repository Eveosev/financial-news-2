A Ukrainian court annulled a ruling
that ordered the return to the government of a 68 percent stake
in an aluminum smelter sold to United Co. Rusal,  Interfax  said,
citing Deputy Head of the State Property Fund Ihor Khotey.  The Ukrainian Supreme Economic Court returned the case to
the Kiev Economic Court, Interfax reported today. The state’s
sale of the Zaporozhskiy aluminum smelter, or Zalk, was earlier
rejected by the court and again in May in an appeal hearing.  Rusal, the largest aluminum producer, planned to challenge
the decision, it said in an e-mailed statement at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
