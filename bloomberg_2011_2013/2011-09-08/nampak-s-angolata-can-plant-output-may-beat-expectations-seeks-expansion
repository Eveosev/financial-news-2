Nampak Ltd. (NPK) , the South African
packaging company, said production from its Angolata beverage-
can plant in Angola may “exceed prior predictions.”  While “some regulatory challenges exist” in Angola,
these are expected to be resolved in January 2012, the company
said in an investor presentation published on its  website  today.  Nampak is also looking for other expansion opportunities in
Angola, “whether by acquisition or greenfield investment,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
