VeriSign Inc. (VRSN)  tumbled the most in
six years after the company announced the departure of Chief
Financial Officer Brian Robins, squelching speculation that it
was poised to be acquired.  The shares dropped $4.88, or 14 percent, to $29.03 at 4
p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, for the biggest
plunge since July 2005. The stock had jumped 13 percent this
week before today after the company canceled appearances at two
conferences, one by Robins, fueling rumors that VeriSign was in
talks to be bought.  An interim CFO will be named soon, Dulles, Virginia-based
VeriSign said yesterday in a statement. Chairman and founder Jim Bidzos has been filling the chief executive officer role after
Mark McLaughlin left last month to take the top job at Palo Alto
Networks Inc. Shareholders were hoping the cancellations might
indicate positive news for VeriSign, which operates computers
that direct  Internet traffic .  Pulling out of two events without explanation suggests that
a “significant corporate action may be pending,” said Ed
Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities Inc.  Part of the reason for the buyout speculation stems from a
previous VeriSign speech cancellation. In May 2010, the company
backed out of a presentation at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  conference,
citing a scheduling conflict. A day later, it announced plans to
sell its authentication-services unit to  Symantec Corp. (SYMC)  for
$1.28 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
