Academy Press Plc and  University
Press Plc (UPL) , educational publishers in  Nigeria , rose by the
maximum daily limit on speculation third-quarter profit will
increase as schools reopen, spurring demand for their products.  Academy Press gained 15 kobo, or 5 percent, its biggest
gain since Jan. 13, 2010, to 3.17 naira, by the 2:30 p.m. close
in Lagos. University Press rose 18 kobo, or 5 percent, the most
since June 8, to 3.78 naira. The  Nigerian Stock Exchange 
introduced a maximum daily limit of five percent on share price
moves, up or down, during the financial crisis three years ago
to prevent wide swings in share prices.  “We are getting closer to the period when profits rise for
these companies,” David Adonri, chief of brokerage Lambeth
Trust and Investment Co., said by phone today. “Schools reopen
in the third quarter and that drives up their profits.”  University Press shares have fallen 44 percent this year
while  Academy Press (ACADEMY)  stock has lost 14 percent. That compares
with a 13.4 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
