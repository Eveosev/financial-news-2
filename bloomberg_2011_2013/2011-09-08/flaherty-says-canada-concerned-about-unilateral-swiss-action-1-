Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today he was concerned about the Swiss central
bank’s decision to move unilaterally to stem gains in the
country’s currency.  “We were concerned when Japan acted unilaterally with
respect to their currency,” said Flaherty, who will attend a
meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in Marseille
tomorrow, speaking to reporters in Ottawa. “We’re also
concerned about Switzerland acting unilaterally. That’s a
discussion I’m sure we’ll get into this weekend.”  The  Swiss National Bank  said this week it will attempt to
prevent the franc from rising with the “utmost determination,”
setting a ceiling of 1.20 francs to the euro.  Flaherty said he will encourage his G-7 colleagues to
maintain commitments made at the 2010 G-20 summit in Toronto,
including to reduce government deficits.  “Our view is that the G-20 commitments made at Toronto to
move toward deficit reduction, balanced budgets, are essential,
and we want to stay the course,” said Flaherty, adding that not
all G-7 countries share  Canada ’s position.  To contact the reporter on this story:
