Kansai Electric  Power Co., which
provides electricity to western  Japan , started commercial
operations of a 10-megawatt solar power plant in Sakai City,
Osaka.  The plant, which started partial operation in October 2010,
can generate power enough for about 3,000 homes, the utility and
the city said in a joint  statement  yesterday.  Kansai Electric plans to build an 18-megawatt solar plant
with Sharp Corp. and Sakai City. The companies have not decided
when construction will start for that plant, Sharp spokeswoman
 Miyuki Nakayama  said today by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
