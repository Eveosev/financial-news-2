The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments dropped 1.5 basis points to 318.5 at 8:30 a.m. in
London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of credit
quality.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 3.5
basis points to 713.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 0.25 basis point to 174.5 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 2 basis points to 259 and the
subordinated index fell 2.5 to 467.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
