South African business confidence
declined to its lowest level in 15 months in August as a
recovery in  Africa ’s largest economy stalled, the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry said.  The business confidence index fell to 98.6 from 99 in July,
the Johannesburg-based chamber said in an e-mailed statement
today. The index is compiled from economic indicators such as
retail sales and inflation, and financial gauges, including the
 stock index  and the currency.  Confidence was adversely affected by a slowdown in economic
growth and rising prices, the chamber said. The economy expanded
an annualized 1.3 percent in the second quarter, the slowest
pace in two years, while inflation accelerated to a 17-month
high of 5.3 percent in July, according to the statistics office.  “Conventional fiscal and monetary measures to stimulate
the global economy appear to have been exhausted,” the chamber
said. The industry group “is growing increasingly concerned
about the current and expected low levels of growth, stagnation
of economic activity and job losses.”  A separate survey published by Rand Merchant Bank on Sept.
6 showed business confidence plunged to a one-year low in the
third quarter as demand for manufactured goods weakened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
