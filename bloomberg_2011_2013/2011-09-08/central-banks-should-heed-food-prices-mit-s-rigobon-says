Central bankers should take food
prices into account in setting policy and targeting inflation,
said Roberto Rigobon, an economics professor at  Massachusetts
Institute of Technology ’s Sloan School of Management.  “I think they should be concerned” about food-price
inflation, Rigobon said today at the Bloomberg Link Global
Inflation conference in New York. “It makes absolutely no sense
for a central banker to be saying ‘my inflation rate is only 2
percent,’ when the consumers in the street are feeling an
inflation rate of 5” percent.  “You lose your legitimacy by the fact that the distance
between  core inflation  and your headline inflation is
tremendous,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
