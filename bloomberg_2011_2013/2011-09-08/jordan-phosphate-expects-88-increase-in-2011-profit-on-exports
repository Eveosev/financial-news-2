Jordan Phosphate Mines (JOPH)  Co. expects
profit to rise 88 percent to 150 million dinars ($212 million)
in 2011 as exports gain, Chairman Walid Kurdi said.  “There is high demand this year from our main markets in
Asia and Europe,” Kurdi said in an interview in Amman today.
“I am very optimistic about this year’s and next year’s
results.”  Jordan Phosphate, the world’s sixth-largest producer of the
fertilizer, had first-half profit of 64 million dinars, he said.
Production will rise by about 18 percent to 7 million metric
tons this year, he said, forecasting a 37 percent increase in
sales to 775 million dinars.  Jordan Phosphate’s largest customers are in India,
Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea, Netherlands, Turkey and
Bulgaria. Applying phosphate to farmers’ fields can boost crop
quality, as well as growth, water-use efficiency and disease
resistance.  The company operates three mines in Jordan with total
reserves of phosphate rock of 800 million tons. The middle-
eastern nation has combined phosphate rock reserves of about 1.7
billion tons, according to Kurdi.  Jordan Phosphate., which exports about 5 million tons
annually, is building a new port in Aqaba in a bid to expand
shipments. The $240 million harbor is expected to be operational
late 2012, Kurdi said.  The company’s newest production site will start commercial
operation in early 2013, with annual output of 500,000 tons of
phosphoric acid, he said.  The $700 million site in the kingdom’s south is a joint
venture between Jordan Phosphate and Indian Farmers Fertiliser
Cooperative Ltd.  Jordan Phosphate’s shareholders include Kamil Holdings
Ltd., owned by the Brunei Investment Agency, with 37 percent,
and the Jordanian government, with 26.2 percent, the company’s
website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
