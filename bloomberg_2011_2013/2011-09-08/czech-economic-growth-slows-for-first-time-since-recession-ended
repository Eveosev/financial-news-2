Czech economic growth eased more
than previously estimated in the second quarter as a
slowdown in the European Union dented demand for exports.  Gross domestic product rose 2.2 percent from a year
earlier, less than the first quarter’s 2.8 percent and below the
2.4 percent preliminary figure published Aug. 16, the Prague-
based Czech Statistics Office said today in a statement on its
website. On a seasonally adjusted basis, GDP grew 0.1 percent
from the previous three months.  “The positive contribution of foreign trade and fixed
asset creation were partially offset by the continued decline in
final household and government consumption,” the office said in
the statement.  The Czech economic recovery is dependent on EU demand for
its products, which include Skoda Auto AS vehicles and car
parts. The bloc purchases about 80 percent of Czech exports,
with Germany alone accounting for a third. Exports account for
70 percent of GDP.  The euro region grew 0.2 percent from the previous three
months in the second quarter compared with 0.8 percent in the
January-March period as governments cut spending to trim budget
deficits. Czech domestic consumption has been constrained by
efforts to reduce its budget gap and by unemployment, which has
exceeded 8 percent for two years.  The central bank in August raised its economic growth
forecast for this year to 2.1 percent from 1.5 percent. It cut
its 2012 estimate to 2.2 percent from 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
