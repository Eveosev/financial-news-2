Officials for the  National
Basketball Association  and its players’ union met for more than
five hours today, marking the first time since the lockout was
imposed on July 1 that negotiations were held on consecutive
days.  The league and union have agreed to meet again on Sept. 13
with both represented sides by their full negotiating committees,
said Jeff Kessler, the lead outside counsel to the players’
association.  Among the participants in today’s meeting in New York were
union Executive Director  Billy Hunter  and NBA Commissioner David Stern, who has said the league’s teams lost a collective $300
million last season on annual sales of more than $4 billion.  The regular season is scheduled to begin on Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
