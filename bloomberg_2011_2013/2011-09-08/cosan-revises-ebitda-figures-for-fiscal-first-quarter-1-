Cosan SA Industria & Comercio, which
shares control of the world’s largest sugar-cane processor with
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) , said it revised a measure of earnings
for the fiscal first quarter after miscalculating some costs.  Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, in the quarter that ended June 30 was 3.82
billion reais ($2.31 billion), compared with a previously
reported 3.76 billion reais, Sao Paulo-based Cosan said today in
a regulatory filing. Ebitda was raised to properly reflect some
amortization and harvesting costs.  Cosan last quarter reported a record quarterly profit of
2.3 billion reais after posting an accounting gain from the
formation of its Raizen venture with Shell. Cosan and Shell in
June concluded combining sugar, ethanol and fuel-distribution
assets in Brazil.  Cosan rose 16 centavos, or 0.7 percent, to 24.06 reais in
Sao Paulo trading at 9:29 a.m. New York time. The stock has
climbed 5.5 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 13
percent drop for Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
