The U.S. Energy Department awarded
$43 million to 41 wind-energy projects to accelerate the
development of offshore power plants.  The funding will be provided over five years to improve the
technology of offshore  wind turbines , including control systems
and support-structure designs, and to eliminate market barriers
that hinder development, the department said today in a
statement.  “The U.S. has an abundant offshore wind resource that
remains untapped,” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in the
statement.  The funding includes $4.5 million for the Gorham, Maine-
based Biodiversity Research Institute, $4.1 million for  Alstom
SA (ALO) ’s U.S. unit Alstom Power Inc. and $4 million for Siemens AG’s
U.S. unit Siemens Energy Inc., according to the agency’s
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
