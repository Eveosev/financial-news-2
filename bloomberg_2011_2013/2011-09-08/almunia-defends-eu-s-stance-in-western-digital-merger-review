European Union regulators “must
give priority” to the first of two rival deals that file for
approval, the EU’s competition commissioner said.  Joaquin Almunia  said the European Commission had to
prioritize  Seagate Technology Plc (STX) ’s plan to expand its computer
hard-drive business over a similar transaction by  Western
Digital Corp. (WDC)  that filed for approval a day later.  Western Digital  is challenging the EU priority decision
that views each deal as shrinking the number of competitors in
the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
