The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index no
longer has to rise above its high for the year to exceed the
average year-end projection of Wall Street strategists, as
compiled by Bloomberg.  Even so, the CHART OF THE DAY shows the strategists as a
group are looking for a bigger gain through Dec. 31 than they
were when the year began. The top panel displays the average
estimate and the  S&P 500 , and the bottom panel tracks the
difference between them in index points.  The S&P 500 will finish the year at 1,353, based on the
average estimate of 13 strategists. The overall figure dropped
since the beginning of August by 48 points, far enough to fall
below the index’s 2011 peak of 1,363.61, set on April 29.  The latest average exceeded yesterday’s close by 154
points, or 13 percent. The gap between the projection and the
S&P 500 widened from 101 points, or 7.9 percent, in the year’s
first survey on Jan. 4.  “Current stock valuations reflect recessionary concerns”
that probably won’t be justified, UBS AG wrote three days ago in
a report.  Jonathan Golub , chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS,
cut his year-end estimate that day to 1,350 from 1,425.  Golub became the fifth strategist to trim his projection
for the S&P 500 since last month, when the index retreated as
much as 13 percent. Credit Suisse Group AG’s Douglas Cliggott,
Deutsche Bank AG’s Binky Chadha and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s
 David Kostin  all cut estimates in August. BMO Capital Markets’
Ben Joyce reduced his 12-month forecast for the index as well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
