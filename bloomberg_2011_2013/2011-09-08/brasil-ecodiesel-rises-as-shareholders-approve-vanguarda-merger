Brasil Ecodiesel Industria e
Comercio de Biocombustiveis e Oleos Vegetais SA (ECOD3) , the biodiesel
maker owned by Spanish billionaire Enrique Banuelos, rose to a
five-week high after shareholders approved the acquisition of
closely held crop producer Vanguarda do Brasil SA.  Brasil Ecodiesel rose 4.7 percent to 67 centavos at the
close of Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the
highest since Aug. 2.  “It’s a good deal for Brasil Ecodiesel, as the company
will no longer depend so much on biodiesel-making and will be
also a crop producer from now on,” Erick Hood, an analyst at
SLW Corretora brokerage, said in a telephone interview. “Demand
for commodities such as corn and soy is likely to remain high
for a while, and Brasil Ecodiesel will benefit from that,” said
Hood, who has a “buy” recommendation for the stock.  The Sao Paulo-based company will swap 1.1 billion reais
($665 million) worth of its shares for all of Vanguarda’s,
Marcelo Passaglia Paracchini, chief executive officer of
Veremonte Participacoes SA, the  investment company  that owns 40
percent of Vanguarda, said in a telephone interview on Sept. 6.
Brazilian markets were closed yesterday for a national holiday.  Brasil Ecodiesel will likely pursue additional deals, and
another acquisition might be announced within two months,
Paracchini said.  Banuelos will own 21 percent of the company resulting from
the merger between Brasil Ecodiesel and Vanguarda, according to
Paracchini.  To contact the reporter on this story:
