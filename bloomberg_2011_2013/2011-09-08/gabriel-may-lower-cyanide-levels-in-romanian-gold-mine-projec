Gabriel Resources Ltd. (GBU) , the Canadian
gold miner, said it may lower the cyanide level in a tailing
pond at its Rosia Montana gold-mine project to obtain a permit
from the Romanian Environment Ministry.  The Toronto-based company may lower the cyanide level to
three parts per million concentration, less than the currently
proposed five parts-per-million concentration, which is half of
the European Union’s maximum allowed level, local director
Cecilia Szentesy told reporters in Bucharest today.  Romania’s Environment Minister Laszlo Borbely asked the
company to lower the cyanide level last month. The ministry also
asked the company to set aside about $160 million in
environmental guarantees in the first years of development,
