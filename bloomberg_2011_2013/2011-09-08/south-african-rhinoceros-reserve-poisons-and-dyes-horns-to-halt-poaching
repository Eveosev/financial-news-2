The Rhino & Lion Reserve, a
privately-owned park north of Johannesburg, said it is
conducting tests to inject poison and an indelible dye into the
horns of living rhinos to combat poaching.  “Testing is ongoing and comprehensive to ensure that the
animals are in no way harmed,” it said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. While harmless to rhinos the poison causes nausea,
vomiting and convulsions in humans.  Poachers in  South Africa  have killed at least 279 rhinos
this year to meet demand for the horns in east  Asia  where they
are used for supposed medicinal properties, the country’s
environmental affairs ministry said on Aug. 29. The country is
home to 93 percent of the continent’s rhino population.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
