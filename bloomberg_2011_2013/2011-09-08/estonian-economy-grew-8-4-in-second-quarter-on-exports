Estoniaâ€™s economy grew at a slower
pace in the second quarter from a year earlier than in the
previous three-month period, weighed down by slowing output.  Gross domestic product rose 8.4 percent from a year
earlier, unrevised from a preliminary estimate and a revised 9.5
percent rate in the first quarter, the Tallinn-based statistics
office said on its website today.  Output grew a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent from a
quarter before, compared with a preliminary estimate of 1.8
percent. The office recalculated figures for the first quarter
and earlier periods due to methodology changes, it said.  The $19 billion economy became the first former Soviet
Republic to adopt the euro on Jan. 1, seeking to boost trade and
investment after recording the second-deepest recession in the
European Union in 2008 and 2009 behind  Latvia . The Baltic nation
has grown at the fastest pace in the 27-member bloc this year,
helped by rising demand for wireless network gear manufactured
at the local plant of Stockholm-based Ericsson AB, and by higher
shipments of Russian oil products through its ports.  Exports rose an annual 54 percent in the first half, the
statistics office said last month.  The  Finance Ministry  revised its growth forecast for this
year to 7 percent yesterday and reduced 2012 forecast to 3
percent, saying rising global uncertainty will cap boost from
stronger-than-expected exports and investment. The expansion may
slow to 1 percent next in a risk scenario which foresees a
global double-dip recession, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
