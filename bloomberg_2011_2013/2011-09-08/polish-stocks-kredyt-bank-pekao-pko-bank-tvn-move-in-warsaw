Poland ’s WIG20 Index fell 3.81, or
0.2 percent, to 2,365.94 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
declining for the first time in three days.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB)   gained 0.19 zloty, or 1.5 percent,
to 12.99 zloty, extending yesterday’s 6.8 percent advance. Banco
Santander SA is seeking to buy the Polish unit of KBC Groep NV,
Dziennik Gazeta Prawna reported, without saying where it got the
information. Santander, which owns  Bank Zachodni WBK SA (BZW) , would
merge it with Kredyt Bank to create the third-largest bank in
Poland, Dziennik said.  A spokeswoman for Santander, who asked not to be identified
by name in line with company policy, declined to comment on the
newspaper’s report.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, lost
0.1 zloty, or 0.3 percent, to 33.29 zloty and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , majority-owned by UniCredit SpA, sank 4.5 zloty, or 3.2
percent, to 138.5 zloty.  The zloty weakened for the first time in three days against
the Swiss franc, reviving concern homeowners may default on
their foreign-currency mortgage loans. Franc-denominated
mortgages totaled 162.2 billion zloty ($54.2 billion) in July,
accounting for 54 percent of all home loans in Poland, according
to the country’s financial regulator.  TVN SA (TVN)  , Poland’s largest television network, rose
0.44 zloty, or 3.3 percent, to 13.94 zloty, climbing for a
second day. ITI Holdings SA expects to sell its entire 56
percent stake in the company at an enterprise value of at least
22 zloty per share, Puls Biznesu reported today, without saying
where it got the information. Time Warner Inc. and Bertelsmann
AG are among companies interested in the stake, Puls said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
