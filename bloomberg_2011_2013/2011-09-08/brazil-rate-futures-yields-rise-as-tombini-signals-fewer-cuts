Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts rose after the central bank signaled it may
cut borrowing costs less than expected, prompting traders to
reverse bets on more aggressive cuts.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 rose 17
basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 10.76 percent at 4:59
p.m. New York time. The contract due in January increased one
basis point to 11.41 percent, indicating traders are betting the
central bank will cut  interest rates  100 basis points over the
next two policy meetings this year.  Policy makers, in the minutes of the central bank’s Aug.
30-31 meeting, said the global economic slowdown may be more
prolonged even as it may be less acute than the crisis that
followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.
The bank repeated its forecast that annual inflation will begin
to slow in the third quarter, while acknowledging that consumer
demand remains “robust.”  The minutes signaled “less cuts than the market
expected,” because they said the impact of the global economic
slowdown on  Brazil  will be “less sharp than in 2008,” said
Marcelo Gazzano, an economist with RBS Securities Inc. in  Sao
Paulo .  Policy makers cut the benchmark Selic target rate a half
point, to 12 percent, last month after raising it at their
previous five meetings.  Barclays Plc cut its forecast for the year-end interest
rate to 11 percent after the minutes were published, from a
forecast of 12.5 percent before the August policy meeting.
Jankiel Santos, chief economist at Espirito Santo Investment
Bank, also cut his year-end interest rate forecast to 11
percent, a prediction shared by Citigroup Inc.  The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.6602 per dollar, from 1.6571
on Sept. 6. Brazilian markets were closed yesterday for a
holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
