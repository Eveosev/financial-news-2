David Blanchflower , an economics
professor at Dartmouth College, said the effectiveness of
monetary policy is hindered by “discontinuity” between tactics
for fighting inflation and deflation.  While central bank leaders, including Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , can tackle rapid price acceleration by
increasing interest rates, it is unclear what to do when
inflation falls to zero or becomes negative, Blanchflower said
today during an interview with Tom Keene at the Bloomberg Global
Inflation Conference hosted by Bloomberg Link.  “That’s the discontinuity, and that’s what keeps Bernanke
and keeps me awake at night,” said Blanchflower, a former
official with the Bank of England. “It’s the fear of negative
price changes. I don’t know about all this fear of
hyperinflation. I haven’t seen any. We know what to do about it,
and Bernanke and I could fix it in 20 minutes,”  The Fed pledged on Aug. 9 to hold  interest rates  at zero to
0.25 percent, where they have been since 2008, until at least
the middle of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
