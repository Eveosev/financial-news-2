Chile’s student leaders are meeting
today to discuss their response to a government offer for face-
to-face talks on demands for lower cost and higher quality
schooling, as students prepare more protests.  Leaders including Camila Vallejo, president of the
University of Chile’s Student Federation, known as Fech, will
debate how to respond to an offer by President Sebastian Pinera,
Fech said in a  statement . The teacher’s union rejected the
proposal, it  said  on its website.  Protesters will hold a demonstration in front of a
University of Chile campus in Santiago this evening, calling on
the government to improve access to education and ban for-profit
schools, the Fech said. Pinera, who has proposed creating a $4
billion education fund, today asked students to accept his
government’s proposal.  “The time is over for strikes and violence, burning of
schools and causing damage, pain and destruction,” he said in a
speech transmitted on state television. “Our government is
absolutely committed to do a deep and structural reform of our
educational system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
