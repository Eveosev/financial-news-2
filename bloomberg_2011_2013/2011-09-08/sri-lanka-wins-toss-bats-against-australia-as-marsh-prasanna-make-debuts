Australia  took control on the
opening day of the second cricket Test with Sri Lanka by bowling
the host out for 174.  Ryan Harris took 3-38, while Trent Copeland, Mitchell Johnson and Nathan Lyon claimed two wickets each, after Sri
Lanka won the toss and elected to bat in Kandy. Angelo Mathews
was top scorer with 58 and  Kumar Sangakkara  had 48.  Shane Watson  scored 36 and Phillip Hughes had 23 as
Australia reached 60 without loss at stumps to trail by 114
runs.  Australia made one change from the team that won the series
opener in Galle, bringing in Shaun Marsh for his Test debut in
place of No. 3 batsman  Ricky Ponting , who returned to Australia
for the birth of his second child.  Marsh was presented with his so-called Baggy Green cap
before the start of play from his father, Geoff, a former
opening batsman who played 50 Tests and 117 one-day
internationals for Australia.  Sri Lanka named leg-spinner Seekkuge Prasanna for his Test
debut after both Rangana Herath and Ajantha Mendis were ruled
out because of injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
