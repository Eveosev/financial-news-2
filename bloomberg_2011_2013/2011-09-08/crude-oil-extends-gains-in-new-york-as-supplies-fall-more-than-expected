Crude oil futures extended their
gains after a U.S. government report showed a larger decline in
inventories than analysts expected.  Supplies fell 3.96 million barrels to 353.1 million in the
week ended Sept. 2, the Energy Department said today.
Inventories were forecast to decrease 2 million barrels,
according to the median of 15 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Crude oil for October delivery rose 68 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $90.02 a barrel at 11:04 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  Oil traded at $89.90 a barrel before the release of the
report at 11 a.m. in Washington, a day later than usual because
of the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Sept. 5.  Crude also rose before President Barack Obama addresses a
rare joint session of Congress on jobs. Obama will propose a
more than $300 billion stimulus plan in the Republican-
controlled House chamber as job growth stalls and the
unemployment rate hovers above 9 percent.  The International Energy Agency won’t ask its members to
tap their emergency oil stockpiles again because supplies have
risen over the summer, the new head of the energy adviser to 28
industrialized nations said.  “I don’t think there is any reason to do that given the
present situation -- no, no, no,” Maria van der Hoeven, the 61-
year-old executive director of the Paris-based IEA, said in an
interview yesterday. She began her four-year term on Sept. 1,
succeeding Nobuo Tanaka from Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
