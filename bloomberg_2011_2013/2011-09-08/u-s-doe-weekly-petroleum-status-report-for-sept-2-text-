barrels per day during the week ending September 2, 6 thousand
barrels per day above the previous weekâ€™s average. Refineries
operated at 89.0 percent of their operable capacity last week.
Gasoline production decreased last week, averaging about 9.2
million barrels per day. Distillate fuel production decreased
last week, averaging 4.5 million barrels per day.  U.S. crude oil imports averaged nearly 8.6 million barrels per
day last week, down by about 1.0 million barrels per day from
the previous week. Over the last four weeks, crude oil imports
