Canaccord Financial Inc. (CF) ,  Canada ’s
largest independent brokerage, won’t make an offer to buy
 Evolution Group Plc (EVG)  after holding talks with the British
stockbroker.  Canaccord didn’t elaborate in a statement sent today on why
it won’t proceed with an offer. The company said in August it
held talks with London-based Evolution Group.  Evolution Group then said on Aug. 16 it had received
“approaches from a number of other parties.”  Scott Davidson, a spokesman for Toronto-based Canaccord,
didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking comment placed
after regular business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
