A Kenyan court ordered Cortec
Mining, a South African company, to stop prospecting for
minerals at Mrima Hills in southeastern Kenya, the  Daily Nation 
reported, citing High Court Judge Maureen Odero.  The order was issued after the Kaya Mrima Self-Help Group
convinced the court that Cortec was granted a prospecting-mining
license incorrectly, the Nairobi-based newspaper said. A case
filed by representatives of the group said the area where
prospecting is taking place is a gazetted forest and nature
reserve, it said.  Cortec has invested 13.5 billion shillings ($144 million)
in the project so far, the newspaper said.  The South African company is 70 percent owned by Kelowna,
Canada-based  Pacific Wildcat Resources Corp. (PAW) , the newspaper said
on Aug. 11.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
