Slovenia’s economic recovery is at
risk from the euro region’s debt crisis because it hampers
access to funding, according to the government’s forecasting
institute.  “Short-term indicators of economic activity and confidence
are pointing to a further slowdown of the economy,” the
Institute for Macroeconomic Analysis and Development said in an
e-mailed statement today. “Gross domestic product expansion in
the first half was very modest, powered by exports and dragged
by the  construction industry .”  Slovenia’s export-dependent economy expanded 0.9 percent in
the second quarter on the year, compared with 2.3 percent in the
first three months. GDP gained 0.1 percent in the first half,
according to the institute.  The economy of the Balkan nation is losing momentum as
austerity measures in  Europe  sap demand and the sovereign-debt
crisis puts the brake on the economic recovery. The institute
has joined the Slovenian central bank in warning that a lack of
credit is further crimping the fragile economic recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
