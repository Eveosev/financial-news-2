The corn crop in  Argentina , the
world’s second-largest exporter, is threatened by a lack of rain
in the main growing regions that’s also affecting wheat, the
Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said.  Corn planting and the growth of the wheat crop, which is
fully planted, may be hindered by dry conditions, the exchange
said today in its weekly crop report. The country needs
sufficient rain to restore soil moisture in the east of the main
growing region to achieve a forecast to plant 3.5 million
hectares (8.65 million acres) of corn, the exchange said.  Argentine corn farmers will harvest a record 28 million
metric tons in the season that started last month and ends in
August 2012, Agriculture Undersecretary Oscar Solis said in an
Aug. 25 interview. Farmers have planted 4.6 million hectares of
wheat in the 2011-2012 season, though dry conditions in the west
of the growing region are affecting the output outlook,
according to the report.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 14 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $7.34 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid speculation that this year’s price rally will prompt
livestock producers to use other grains as feedstock. The grain
has risen 17 percent this year. Wheat futures for December
delivery fell 13.5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $7.38 a bushel on
the CBOT.  To contact the reporters on this story:
