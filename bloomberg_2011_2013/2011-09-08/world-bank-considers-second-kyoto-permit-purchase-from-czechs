The  World Bank  said its carbon funds
may buy greenhouse gas permits created under the 1997  Kyoto
Protocol  from the  Czech Republic , the second such deal.  “We can confirm that negotiations on an Assigned Amount
Unit agreement between the Czech Republic and certain World
Bank-administered carbon funds are at an advanced stage,” the
bank said today by e-mail. “However, the agreement is not
signed yet and we therefore cannot disclose the volume being
discussed.”  In May 2010, the Washington-based development bank agreed
to buy 2 million AAUs from the country on behalf of its Spanish
Carbon Fund (Tranche 2) and its Carbon Fund for Europe, the
institution’s only other AAU-purchase agreement, according to
the e-mail and a  document  published on its website.  Assigned Amount Units were created under the protocol, an
agreement between nations to curb global warming in the five
years through 2012. The Czech Republic has surplus AAUs because
it cut  greenhouse gases  as some of the country’s biggest
emitters went out of business or shut operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
