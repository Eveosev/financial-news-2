Former  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  Chief
Executive Officer Georges Pauget told  Les Echos  in an interview
that he doesn’t see a need for a general refinancing by European
banks.  French banks are correctly financed for normal situations,
he told the newspaper, adding that recent volatility in banking
shares has often been the result of rumors.  If market conditions haven’t improved by the end of the
year then other refinancing solutions may be necessary, he said.  Addressing comments by International Monetary Fund head
 Christine Lagarde  that European banks need refinancing, Pauget
said that the main problem facing banks is political inertia at
the European level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
