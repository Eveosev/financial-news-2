Washington Post Co. (WPO)  said its board
has approved the repurchase of as many as 750,000 shares of the
companyâ€™s Class B common stock.  The Washington-based company, which owns the Washington
Post newspaper and Kaplan education business, did not announce a
ceiling price or a time limit for the purchases, according to a
statement.  Washington Post Co., which has faced increasing government
scrutiny at its for-profit colleges and lower advertising and
circulation revenue at its newspapers, also declared a regular
quarterly dividend of $2.35 per share, payable on Nov. 4, to
shareholders of record on Oct. 24.  Washington Post Co. increased $1.96 to $328.01 at 1:10 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
declined 26 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
