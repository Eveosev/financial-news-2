The increase in orders to take
aluminum out of  Detroit  warehouses is related to banks using the
metal for financings, said  Martin Abbott , chief executive
officer of the London Metal Exchange.  The increase in so-called canceled orders at Detroit
warehouses monitored by the LME is unrelated to “real”
consumption of metal, Abbott said at a Metal Bulletin conference
in Paris. Canceled warrants are orders to take metal out of
warehouses.  The canceled warrants in Detroit warehouses have more than
doubled this year, to 205,100 metric tons, according to LME
data. They make up 67 percent of all aluminum canceled warrants
and 4.4 percent of the global inventory.  Banks are using canceled warrants to shift metal to “non-
listed storage” warehouses that are not monitored by the LME
for financing transactions, Abbott said. Aluminum is attractive
for financing because there is plenty of metal available, prices
are more expensive in the future, and low  interest rates  allow
for metal to be borrowed now and sold later at a profit.  “The opportunity to structure such deals is greater now
than ever before due to the seemingly endless availability of
cheap finance from central banks,” Abbott said. “Detroit is a
prime target in the U.S. for financiers,” he said. That’s
because warrants stored in Detroit are “freely available in the
market,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
