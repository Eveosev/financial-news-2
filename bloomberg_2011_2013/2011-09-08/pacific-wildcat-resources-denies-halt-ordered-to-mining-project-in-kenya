Pacific Wildcat Resources Corp. (PAW) , a
Canada-based mineral producer and explorer, denied its unit in
Kenya had been ordered to halt exploration and drilling.  The  Daily Nation , a Nairobi-based newspaper, reported
yesterday that a High Court judge ordered Cortec Mining to stop
prospecting work at Mrima Hills in southeastern Kenya.  “There is no injunction in place,” Pacific Wildcat said
in a statement issued today by Market News Publishing. “All
exploration work continues on Mrima Hill.”  The company said its project had the approval of the Kaya
Mrima Self Help Group, which the Nation said had convinced the
court that Cortec’s prospecting license had been awarded
incorrectly.  A court action brought by the group on Aug. 12 was
withdrawn on Aug. 22 by mutual consent, Pacific Wildcat said,
adding that it had asked the Nation to retract the article.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
