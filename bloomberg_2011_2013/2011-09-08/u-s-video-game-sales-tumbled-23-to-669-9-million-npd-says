(Corrects PlayStation 3 price drop in eighth paragraph.)  Video-game industry sales in the
U.S. declined 4 percent to $1.13 billion in September from a
year earlier, led by declines in sales of game accessories and
consoles.  Sales of new titles rose 3 percent to $630.2 million, Port
 Washington , New York-based NPD Group said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) ’s “Madden NFL 12” was the top-
selling game for the month. Console sales fell 9 percent to $349
million from $382.9 million a year earlier, NPD said.  The industry has suffered a prolonged sales slump this year
amid a relatively weak slate of titles. The biggest releases,
including Redwood City, California-based Electronic Arts’
“Battlefield 3” and  Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) ’s “Call of Duty:
Modern Warfare 3,” are due through December and could turn 2011
sales into positive territory, NPD has said. The research did
not provide analysis of September sales.  Nintendo Co. in late July cut the price to $170 from $250
for its portable 3DS gaming system, which allows for 3-D viewing
without the need for special glasses. The Kyoto, Japan-based
company also lowered its profit forecast.  Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony  Nintendo sold 260,000 3DS systems, an increase of more than
10 percent over the prior month, the company said in a
statement. Its home console, the Wii, sold 240,000 units down
from 254,000 a year earlier.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , based in Redmond, Washington, sold 438,000
Xbox 360 game consoles, the top-selling video-game player in
September, it said. The company a year ago sold 483.9 million
game consoles.  U.S. sales of  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s PlayStation 3 jumped 20 percent
in September, as the video-game industry moved into the peak
holiday buying period.  Tokyo-based Sony, which cut the price of the PlayStation 3
in August to $249.99 from $299.99, saw software sales rise 52
percent, spokesman  Patrick Seybold , citing NPD research, said in
an e-mailed statement. The Tokyo-based company did not release
its monthly U.S. sales figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
