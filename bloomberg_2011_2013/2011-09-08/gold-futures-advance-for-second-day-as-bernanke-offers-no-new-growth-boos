Gold rebounded, paring a weekly loss,
as expectations of further stimulus in the U.S. stoked demand
for safer assets.  Bullion for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.5 percent
to $1,880.03 an ounce after falling as much as 0.9 percent to
$1,853.93. It was 0.2 percent higher at $1,873.68 at 3:43
Singapore time. December delivery futures in  New York  gained as
much as 1.4 percent to $1,883.70 an ounce.  Obama called on Congress to pass a jobs plan that would
inject $447 billion into the economy through spending on
infrastructure, subsidies to local governments to stem teacher
layoffs, and cutting in half the payroll taxes paid by workers
and small-business owners.  “The plan reflects the government’s deep concern about the
economy, raising the real possibility of another round of
quantitative easing, which is supportive of gold,” said Duan
Shihua, head of corporate services at Haitong Futures Co. and
the top-rated gold analyst this year in an annual poll by the
Futures Daily and Securities Times. “We’re just getting some
book squaring today as investors digest the news, but that just
represents to us a good buying opportunity.”  Spot gold, which reached a record $1,921.15 an ounce on
Sept. 6, is down 0.5 percent this week. It rebounded from a two-
day, 4.4 percent-slump yesterday after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  held off from offering new measures to spur
growth, boosting demand for gold as a store of value.  Jobless Claims  First-time applications for  unemployment benefits  rose last
week, a sign the labor market is struggling to gain traction.
Claims for unemployment benefits rose 2,000 to 414,000 in the
week ended Sept. 3, data yesterday showed, adding to signs the
 U.S. economy  is faltering. The median target of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a drop to 405,000.  “Concerns over the health of the European banks are aiding
gains in the metal,” said Kunal Shah, head of research at Nirmal
Bang Commodities Pvt in Mumbai.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
yesterday “downside risks” to the euro area’s economy have
intensified as the region’s debt crisis worsens. The central
bank kept  interest rates  unchanged.  Gold is still in the 11th year of a  bull market , the
longest winning streak since at least 1920 in  London , as
investors seek to diversify away from equities and some
currencies, and hedge against inflation.  Bullion may touch $2,000 an ounce by October as concerns
over the U.S. and European economic problems persist, Mehul
Choksi, chairman of  India ’s biggest jewelry retailer Gitajali
Gems Ltd., said yesterday.  China Demand  Consumer prices in China climbed 6.2 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing today.
That compared with the 6.2 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 31 economists and July’s 6.5 percent
gain, which was the highest level in three years.  China ’s gold investment demand surged 44 percent in the
second quarter from a year ago to 53 metric tons of coins and
bars, according to the World Gold Council. That was second-
largest after India. Jewelry demand in the country gained 16
percent to 102.9 tons, council data showed.  Platinum for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1,857.85 an ounce, trading below gold for a fifth time this
week. Cash silver rose 0.7 percent to $42.63 an ounce, while
palladium rose 0.4 percent to $762 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
