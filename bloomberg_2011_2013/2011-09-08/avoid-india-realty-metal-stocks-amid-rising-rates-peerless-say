Kaushik Dani, a Mumbai-based  fund
manager  at Peerless Mutual Fund, which has 49 billion rupees in
assets, comments on the outlook for Indian stocks. Dani spoke in
a phone interview.  The BSE India Sensitive Index advanced 0.1 percent to
17,082.68 as of 10:51 a.m. local time.  On market outlook:  “Global concerns are still there, which continue to affect
markets. A major concern is the high inflation rate, which is
not softening. Credit options are also slowing down. Everyone is
eyeing the U.S. jobs data to come out today, to see how markets
will go.”  On  interest rates :  “There is a general consensus of a 25-basis point rise in
interest rates on Sept. 16. The most important thing to watch
out for is the monthly inflation data, which is out before the
policy is announced. Inflation is not decreasing month-on-month
and if comes on the higher side, it will show things in the
economy are not improving.”  The central bank has raised its repurchase rate 11 times
since the start of 2010 and last increased it by 50 basis points
on July 26 to 8 percent to damp living costs that are rising the
fastest among the so-called BRICS nations.  On investment strategy:  “For the past couple of quarters, we have been focusing on
non-interest rate sensitive sectors, like  consumer goods ,
health-care and select technology stocks. We also like a few
automobile stocks. Investors should avoid high rate-sensitive
sectors, where leverage is high, such as realty, metals and
power-generation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
