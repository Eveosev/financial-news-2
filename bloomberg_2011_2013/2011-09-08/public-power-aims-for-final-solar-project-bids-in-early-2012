Public Power Corp SA (PPC) , Greece’s
biggest electricity producer, will ask for final bids in a
tender to build a 200 megawatt photovoltaic park and panel
production plant in Kozani, northern Greece, to be submitted by
early 2012.  The 15 companies that bid for the project will be asked to
submit binding offers so as to start construction by “next
summer,” according to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-
based company today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
