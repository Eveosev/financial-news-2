Raw sugar may advance next week on
signs that  China  may boost imports and concern that output from
 Brazil , the world’s top producer, will trail demand.  Eight of 12 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar in  New York  will rise. Three
forecast a drop, and one was neutral. Before today, the contract
for October delivery fell 1.5 percent this week to 28.73 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S.  Five respondents said refined sugar on London’s NYSE Liffe
will gain, and the same number expected a decline. Two were
neutral. Before today, futures for October delivery rose 1.2
percent this week to $763 a metric ton.  Three people said that the refined premium over raw would
widen, four said it will narrow, and four were neutral.  To contact the reporters on this story:
