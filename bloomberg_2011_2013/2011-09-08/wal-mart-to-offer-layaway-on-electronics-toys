Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, plans to resume layaway on electronics and
toys this holiday season as customers struggle to make
purchases.  The program will be available at all stores nationwide
starting Oct. 17 and running through Dec. 16, the Bentonville,
Arkansas-based company said today in a statement. Toys and
electronics with a retail price of $15 or more will be eligible.  Wal-Mart, which canceled layaway for everything except
jewelry in 2006, is trying to reverse declining sales at U.S.
supercenters and discount stores, which excluding fuel slipped
0.9 percent in the second quarter. Wal-Mart shoppers’ biggest
concern is unemployment, Chief Financial Officer  Charles Holley 
said on a conference call last month.  “We’re always looking for ways to ease budget strain for
our customers, and we know this holiday season in particular
brings with it additional financial pressure,” Duncan Mac Naughton, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising officer, said in the
statement.  Wal-Mart fell 21 cents to $52.21 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have slipped 3.2
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
