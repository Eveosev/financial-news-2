Belarus’s central bank said it would
use its reserves to smooth volatility in the ruble after the
currency is floated next week.  “The increase in gold and currency reserves provides the
 Natsionalnyi Bank Respubliki Belarus  with the opportunity to
smooth speculative fluctuations in the ruble exchange rate,”
the bank said today in a  statement  on its website.  Belarus, which is grappling with a balance-of-payments
crisis that forced a 36 percent devaluation of the ruble in May,
will allow the market to determine the currency’s exchange rate,
scrapping official government rates, President  Alexander Lukashenko  said Aug. 30. While the ruble’s value may decline 30
percent to 50 percent against the dollar, the move will help
address the country’s trade deficit, Moody’s said Sept. 5.  Belarus’s gold and foreign-currency reserves rose 10
percent in August to $4.6 billion, according to central bank
 data . Free trade in the currency on the  Belarusian Currency and
Stock Exchange  is scheduled to begin Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
