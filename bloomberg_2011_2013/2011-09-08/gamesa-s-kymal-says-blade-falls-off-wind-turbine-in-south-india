Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA,
Europe’s second-biggest wind turbine maker, is investigating an
accident in which a blade fell off of an 850-kilowatt turbine in
southern India, the head of the company’s local unit said.  The accident is an “isolated” incident, Ramesh Kymal,
chairman and managing director of Gamesa Wind Turbines Pvt.,
said today by telephone. “We have more than 7,000 of these
turbines operating worldwide without any problems.”  The turbine was installed about five years ago at a wind
farm owned by  Pioneer Wincon Pvt. , which has been maintaining
the equipment, said Kymal. “We haven’t been doing the
maintenance even though we wanted to,” he said.  Pioneer Chief Executive Officer D.V. Giri said the blade
fell off the turbine two days ago and hit a transmission line,
knocking out power temporarily. Power has since been restored,
Giri said by telephone today.  There were no signs of abnormalities prior to the incident,
and Gamesa is sending technicians to investigate, he said.  It wasn’t clear if the blade broke or fell from the joints.
 Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , India’s biggest wind turbine maker, spent
$100 million on a global retrofit program after rotor blades
shipped to customers developed cracks starting in 2007.  When blades fell from a Suzlon turbine at a North Dakota
wind farm earlier this year, an investigation determined that it
was a “singular event” caused by the failure of a bolt
connecting the rotor assembly to the nacelle,  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , the
project’s owner, said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
