Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
criticized Ukrainian counterpart  Viktor Yanukovych  for calling a
natural-gas agreement between two countries “unfair” and the
“work of the devil.”  “That is just outrageous,” Medvedev told Euronews in
Yaroslavl, Russia, where he attended global policy forum
yesterday, according to the transcript of the interview released
by the Kremlin. “All contracts must be executed until they are
terminated legally through the court or revoked by the parties.”  Medvedev indicated that Russia may compromise on the gas
deal’s conditions if Ukraine allows the country to enter its
transit network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
