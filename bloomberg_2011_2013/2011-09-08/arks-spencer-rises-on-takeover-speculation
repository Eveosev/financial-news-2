Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  rose for a
second day in London trading after the Independent newspaper
reported renewed speculation that the U.K.’s largest clothing
retailer may be a takeover target for private equity firms.  The stock advanced as much as 4.5 percent and was up
4 percent at 326.4 pence at 10:32 a.m., extending yesterday’s
4 percent gain and valuing the retailer at 5.17 billion pounds
($8.24 billion).  Apax Partners LLP may be considering a bid of 450 pence a
share, the Independent said, without saying where it got the
information. There is “vague chatter” that other companies may
try to buy the retailer, according to the newspaper. An Apax
spokesman declined to comment on the report when contacted by
Bloomberg.  Billionaire  Philip Green  proposed a takeover of Marks &
Spencer in 2004 worth 9.1 billion pounds, or 400 pence a share.
Former Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Rose  fended off the
attempt.  In July, the retailer reported 13-week sales growth that
missed some analysts’ estimates because of stagnant general-
merchandise revenue. Chief Executive Officer  Marc Bolland  plans
to expand online and in markets outside the U.K. to reach sales
of 12.5 billion pounds by fiscal 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
