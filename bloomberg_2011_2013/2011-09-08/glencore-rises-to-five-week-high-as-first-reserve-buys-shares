Glencore International Plc advanced
to the highest level in five weeks in  London  trading after First
Reserve Corp. sold bonds in the world’s largest publicly traded
commodities supplier and bought shares.  Glencore rose as much as 6.7 percent to 432.9 pence, the
highest since Aug. 4. First Reserve said it sold $800 million of
Glencore convertible bonds and bought stock.  “We consider this to be a bullish signal for Glencore’s
shares,” Liberum Capital analysts wrote in a note. “First
Reserve is a specialist natural resources private equity firm.”
First Reserve Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Macaulay is a Glencore non-executive director “and we expect it
will remain a long term Glencore shareholder,” Liberum said.  The purchase is equivalent to 2 percent of the shares in
issue, they wrote, keeping Glencore as a “conviction buy.”  Glencore climbed 5.1 percent to 426.25 pence by 12:03 p.m.
in London, valuing it at 29.5 billion pounds ($47 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
