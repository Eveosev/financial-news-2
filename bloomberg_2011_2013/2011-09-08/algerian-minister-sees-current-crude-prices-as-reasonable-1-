Algeria’s Oil Minister Youcef Yousfi
said current  oil prices  are fair for buyers and producers and
that price fluctuations “do not harm” exporters of crude,
speaking on national radio’s Channel 1.  “Prices now are reasonable and suitable for us as
exporters and for consumers, even those who are going through
economic and financial problems,” Yousfi told the radio in an
interview broadcast today.  Oil for October delivery rose 44 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$89.78 a barrel at 9:46 a.m. local time on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Brent crude for October gained 30 cents to
$116.10 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
Exchange.  Yousfi said he expects the North African country’s income
from oil and gas to increase 20 percent this year.  Algeria , a
member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
pumped 1.26 million barrels a day of crude in August, according
to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
