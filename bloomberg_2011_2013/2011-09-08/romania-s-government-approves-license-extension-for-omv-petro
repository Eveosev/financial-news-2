Romania ’s government approved a
three-year extension of  OMV Petrom SA (SNP) ’s exploration licenses in
the country, government spokeswoman Ioana Muntean said.  The country’s biggest oil company gave up about 30 percent
of the initially contracted permits for the oil and gas blocks
it plans to explore, Muntean said in a phone interview today.  The Romanian licenses, which  OMV AG (OMV) , central Europe biggest
oil company, holds via Petrom, are due to expire on Sept. 12 and
were granted to Petrom before it was sold to OMV in 2004.  A failure to renew the licenses or a renewal delay would
have “a material adverse effect on Petrom’s business, results
of operations and its financial condition,” OMV said in May in
the prospectus of a planned share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
