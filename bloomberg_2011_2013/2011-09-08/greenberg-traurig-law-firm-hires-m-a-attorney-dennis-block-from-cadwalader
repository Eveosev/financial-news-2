Dennis Block, a lawyer who worked on
 Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s acquisition of Wyeth and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s
buyout of Bear Stearns, is joining Greenberg Traurig LLP as
senior chairman of its global mergers and acquisitions practice.  Block will begin on Sept. 12 and will be based in the
firm’s New York office, Greenberg Traurig said in a statement.  “Dennis is one of this country’s top mergers and
acquisitions lawyers,” Richard A. Rosenbaum, Greenberg
Traurig’s chief executive officer, said in the statement. “He
will help move our team into the ranks of the foremost M&A
practices in  New York City .”  Block is leaving Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP, where he
was a senior partner in the firm’s corporate practice group.
Block also represented Pfizer in its $100 billion acquisition of
Warner-Lambert and $60 billion purchase of Pharmacia, according
to the statement.  Cadwalader Chairman  Christopher White  said Block had made
“many valuable contributions” in his 13 years at the firm.  “We respect him and his contribution to the firm and wish
him well in the future,” White said in an e-mail.  Block will be reunited with former colleague Bruce Zirinsky, co-chair of Greenberg Traurig’s global business
reorganization and financial restructuring practice. The two men
worked together at Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP and Cadwalader,
according to the statement.  Greenberg Traurig operates more than 33 U.S. and
international offices with about 1,800 lawyers. The firm’s
global mergers and acquisitions practice has more than 350
