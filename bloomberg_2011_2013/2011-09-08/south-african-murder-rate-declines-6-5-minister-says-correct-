South Africa ’s murder rate fell for
a fifth straight year as the government expanded the police
force and allocated more money to fighting crime.  A total of 15,940 murders, or 31.9 per 100,000 people, were
committed in the 12 months through March, down from 16,834
homicides, or 34.1 per 100,000 people, the previous year, the
 South African Police Service  said in a report released in
Pretoria today. The incidence of most other crimes also
declined.  The “statistics confirm our assertion that indeed the tide
against crime is turning and that police, joined by society, are
gaining an upper hand against vicious criminals,” Police
Minister Nathi Mthethwa told reporters. “Victory against crime
is now an achievable goal.”  President  Jacob Zuma ’s administration has identified the
fight against crime, which is fueled by a 25.7 percent
unemployment rate, as a top priority. Spending on public order
and safety rose an average 13.1 percent annually over the three
years through March this year, and accounts for about 9 percent
of total government expenditure.  The number of personnel employed by the police force is
projected to reach 200,600 in the current fiscal year, up from
190,199 at the end of March 2010, according to government data.  Rapes Cases Increase  South Africa’s murder rate has fallen from 67.9 per 100,000
people in 1995, when an integrated national police force was
created and national statistics were compiled for the first
time. It is still more than six times higher than that of the
U.S., according to  U.S. Disaster Center  data.  “There has been a very big improvement” in South Africa’s
crime statistics, Gareth Newham, an analyst who heads the
Institute for Security Studies’ crime and justice program, said
by phone from  Pretoria . “We have seen quite a big shift in a
number of reported crime categories. The police are doing a
better job and there are a lot more of them.”  The number of assault cases declined 4.5 percent, attacks
on cash-transit vans fell 29 percent, car hijackings decreased
24 percent and truck hijackings dropped 29 percent, the police
report showed. Bank robberies fell 58 percent while commercial
crimes increased 2.8 percent.  The number of reported sexual offenses fell 3.1 percent,
even as the number of rape cases rose 2.1 percent to 56,272.  “The number of reported cases of rape still remains
unacceptably high,” Mthethwa said. “We cannot seriously say we
are winning the war against rape.”  Most Wanted  Ninety-four police officers were killed on duty over the 12
months, down from 100 a year earlier, while 49 of the country’s
50 most-wanted criminals were arrested.  “By international standards South Africa remains a
dangerous society,” Frans Cronje, deputy chief executive
officer of the Johannesburg-based  South African Institute of
Race Relations , said in an e-mailed statement. “However, the
data suggests that progress is slowly being made in securing a
safer society. This is most probably due to the joint efforts of
the South African Police Service and the private security
industry,” which now has twice as many active personnel as the
police.  To contact the reporters on this story:
