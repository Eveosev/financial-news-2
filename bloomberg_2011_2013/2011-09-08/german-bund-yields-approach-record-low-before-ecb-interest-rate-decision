German 10-year bund yields fell to a
record low after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said “downside risks” to the economy have intensified
and inflation concerns had eased.  Italian bonds declined after the nation’s Senate approved a
revised 54 billion-euro ($75.6 billion) austerity plan as the
government seeks to convince investors it’s serious about
cutting its deficit. French bonds gained as the ECB cut its
euro-area economic growth forecasts for this year and next. The
euro-region’s economy faces “particularly high uncertainty,”
Trichet said at a press conference in Frankfurt after the ECB
kept its benchmark interest rate at 1.5 percent.  “Trichet said the risks have ‘intensified’ and the staff
forecasts for 2012 have been revised down,” said Eric Wand, a
bond strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London. “We
are seeing buyers of bunds coming in. This sort of talk should
support intermediate to longer-dated AAA core product.”  Ten-year bund yields fell to a record 1.823 percent as
Trichet spoke, before being two basis points lower at 1.89
percent at 4:13 p.m. in London. The 2.25 percent securities
maturing September 2021 rose 0.185, or 1.85 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,406) face amount, to 103.275. Two-year notes dropped three
basis points to 0.46 percent. They declined to an all-time low
0.417 percent Sept. 6.  Euribor futures rose, pushing the implied yield on the
contract expiring in June down five basis points to 1.02
percent, signaling traders added to wagers for lower borrowing
costs. It earlier fell to 0.97 percent, the least since Aug. 19.  Forecasts Cut  Trichet said the ECB now forecast growth this year of 1.4
percent to 1.8 percent, down from an earlier prediction of 1.5
percent to 2.3 percent. Growth next year will be 0.4 percent to
2.2 percent, lowered from 0.6 percent to 2.8 percent, he said.
Inflation forecasts were unchanged.  “Trichet toned down the hawkish language modestly, laying
the ground for a softer approach from the ECB over the coming
months,” Stewart Robertson, senior economist at Aviva
Investors, said in an e-mailed note. “Rate rises now look off
the cards, and markets have begun to price in interest-rate
reductions over the next year,” he said.  A Credit Suisse Group AG index shows traders are betting
the ECB will lower its refinancing rate by 29 basis points over
the next 12 months. As recently as Aug. 1, they forecast an
increase of 25 basis points.  French Bonds  French 10-year bond yields dropped eight basis points to
2.59 percent, and Belgium’s 10-year yields declined 11 basis
points to 3.93 percent.  The European debt crisis is sapping confidence in banks and
driving up market borrowing costs, prompting economists such as
Nouriel Roubini and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz to urge
the ECB to reverse this year’s rate tightening.  The Bank of England today kept its key rate at a record low
of 0.5 percent today, and maintained its bond-purchase program
at 200 billion pounds ($321 billion).  Italian bonds dropped for the first time in three days,
with two-year yields climbing three basis points to 3.90
percent, and 10-year rates rising two basis points to 5.28
percent. Italy’s revised austerity package is of “extreme
importance,” Trichet said.  The ECB began buying Italian and Spanish bonds on Aug. 8 to
curtail a surge in yields as contagion from the debt crisis that
engulfed Greece, Ireland and Portugal spread to the euro
region’s third- and fourth-largest economies.  ‘Too High’  Europe’s policy makers have called on politicians from both
nations to trim their budget deficits and restore market
confidence. Italy’s sovereign debt is “too high” and the
country must make massive efforts to cut its deficit, German
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said today in an interview
on Deutschlandfunk radio.  Spain’s two-year yields were little changed at 3.42
percent. Ten-year rates rose two basis points to 5.03 percent.  Greek two-year note yields jumped as much as 85 basis
points to a euro-era record 55.76 percent. The nation’s 10-year
yield climbed to an all-time high 20.13 percent.  Trichet told reporters it would be “an enormous mistake”
for Greece not to cut its deficit.  Irish 10-year bond yields rose five basis points to 8.73
percent, down from a euro-era record 14.22 percent reached on
July 15. Irish debt handed investors a return of 21 percent this
quarter, the best performer among euro-denominated government
bonds, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg.  German government bonds have returned 7.1 percent this
year, the indexes show. Treasuries gained 8 percent, Greek debt
lost 30 percent, and Italian bonds declined 1.1 percent,
according to the indexes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
