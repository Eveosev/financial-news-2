The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
headed for its highest close in a week, advancing 211.15, or 0.7
percent, to 30,725.75 by 12:51 p.m. in Johannesburg, a second
day of gains.  The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s biggest producer
of the metal, headed for its strongest close in more than two
weeks, rising 6.40 rand, or 2 percent, to 331.89 rand. AngloGold
is the top pick among South African gold stocks, UBS AG said, as
it raised Africa’s second-largest producer  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)   to “buy” from “neutral.” The stock added 1.33 rand, or
1.1 percent, to 117.52 rand.  Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  , the publisher of South Africa’s
largest weekend broadsheet newspaper, fell to its lowest in more
than four weeks, dropping 70 cents, or 3.1 percent, to 22 rand.
The company ended talks with a group of investors led by Capitau
Holdings Ltd. after the bidders failed to secure funding because
of tax changes.        Cie Financiere Richemont SA (CFR)  , the world’s second-
biggest luxury-goods company, headed for its highest close in a
week, rising 50 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 39.75 rand. Analysts
at Societe Generale SA raised the stock to “buy” from
“hold,” saying it should enjoy some rerating driven by strong
sales growth and relief on negative Swiss franc developments.  Coal of Africa Ltd. (CZA)  , a coal producer, rose for the
first day in five, climbing 15 cents, or 2 percent, to 7.70
rand. India’s coal imports from South Africa rose 8 percent in
August from a year earlier, according to India Coal Market
Watch.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the world’s second-
biggest platinum miner, declined 4.07 rand, or 2.3 percent, to
171.92 rand. The stock was downgraded to “hold” from “buy”
at Cadiz Securities by equity analyst Nic Dinham.  Nampak Ltd. (NPK)  , a packaging company, gained 16 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to 20.46 rand. The company said production from
its Angolata beverage-can plant in Angola may “exceed prior
predictions.”  Sanlam Group Ltd. (SLM SJ), the largest South Africa-based
insurer, rose to its highest in more than a month, advancing 74
cents, or 2.8 percent, to 27.69 rand. Earnings per share
excluding one-time items and fund transfers jumped 35 percent to
1.09 rand in the six months through June, Sanlam said, beating
the median estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for
adjusted earnings per share of 1.01 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
