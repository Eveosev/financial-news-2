Carol Bartz , who was fired Sept. 6
as Yahoo! Inc.’s chief executive officer, stands to receive a
payout in the range of $10 million after less than three years
on the job.  Bartz, 63, would have received $10.4 million, including
cash and equity, had she been fired at the end of last year,
according to a April 29 filing by the company that estimated the
payout. In addition, Bartz is still eligible for vesting stock
options based on the shares reaching certain milestones in the
future.  Yahoo fired Bartz, who took the helm in January 2009, after
the company posted disappointing sales and struggled to compete
with rivals Facebook Inc. and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  Yahoo will lose its
spot as the top seller of display ads in the U.S. to Facebook
this year, New York-based researcher  EMarketer Inc . has
predicted.  The company said in a filing yesterday that “no new
compensatory or severance arrangements were entered into in
connection with these leadership changes.”  Bartz is eligible for about $3 million based on her salary
and bonus last year, according to the April 29 regulatory
filing. Also, the company would award a pro-rated bonus based on
her months on the job this year, according to the filing.  Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale,  California , fell 6 cents to
$13.55 at 9:49 a.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The shares had dropped 18 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
