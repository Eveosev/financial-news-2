The following is the text of
the U.S. trade balance report for July released by the
Commerce Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, through the Department of Commerce, announced
today that total July exports of $178.0 billion and
imports of $222.8 billion resulted in a goods and services
deficit of $44.8 billion, down from $51.6 billion in June,
revised.  July exports were $6.2 billion more than June
exports of $171.8 billion.  July imports were $0.5 billion
less than June imports of $223.4 billion.  In July, the goods deficit decreased $6.4 billion from
June to $60.6 billion, and the services surplus increased
$0.4 billion to $15.8 billion.  Exports of goods increased
$5.7 billion to $126.9 billion, and imports of goods
decreased $0.7 billion to $187.5 billion.  Exports of
services increased $0.5 billion to $51.1 billion, and
imports of services increased $0.1 billion to $35.3
billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $3.2 billion from
July 2010 to July 2011.  Exports were up $23.4 billion, or
15.1 percent, and imports were up $26.6 billion, or 13.6
percent.  Goods (Census Basis)  The June to July increase in exports of goods reflected
increases in industrial supplies and materials ($2.7
billion); capital goods ($2.2 billion); automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($1.3 billion); and other
goods ($0.2 billion).  A decrease occurred in consumer goods ($0.6 billion).
Foods, feeds, and beverages were virtually unchanged.  The June to July decrease in imports of goods reflected
decreases in industrial supplies and materials ($2.5
billion); other goods ($1.0 billion); and foods, feeds,
and beverages ($0.3 billion). Increases occurred in
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($2.9 billion);
capital goods ($0.3 billion); and consumer goods ($0.1
billion).  The July 2010 to July 2011 increase in exports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials
($9.6 billion); capital goods ($3.4 billion); automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($2.7 billion); foods, feeds,
and beverages ($2.0 billion); and consumer goods ($0.8
billion). A decrease occurred in other goods ($0.5
billion).  The July 2010 to July 2011 increase in imports of goods
reflected increases in industrial supplies and materials
($13.0 billion); capital goods ($5.6 billion); automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($2.9 billion); consumer
goods ($2.2 billion); and foods, feeds, and beverages
($1.2 billion). Other goods were virtually unchanged.  Services  Exports of services increased $0.5 billion from June to
July. The increase was mostly accounted for by increases
in travel, passenger fares, and other transportation
(which includes freight and port services).  A decrease in
transfers under U.S. military sales contracts was partly
offsetting.  Changes in the other categories of services
exports were small.  Imports of services increased $0.1 billion from June
to July. The increase was more than accounted for by
increases in travel and passenger fares.  Changes in the
other categories of services imports were small.  The July 2010 to July 2011 increase in exports of
services was $4.7 billion. The largest increases were in
other private services ($2.2 billion), which includes
items such as business, professional, and technical
services, insurance services, and financial services,
travel ($1.3 billion), and royalties and license fees
($0.7 billion). Within other private services, the largest
increase was in business, professional, and technical
services.  The July 2010 to July 2011 increase in imports of
services was $1.0 billion. The largest increases were in
travel ($0.4 billion), royalties and license fees ($0.3
billion), and passenger fares ($0.3 billion).  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in July, exports of goods and
services averaged $175.2 billion, while imports of goods
and services averaged $224.0 billion, resulting in an
average trade deficit of $48.9 billion.  For the three
months ending in June, the average trade deficit was $48.3
billion, reflecting average exports of $174.6 billion and
average imports of $222.9 billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The July figures show surpluses, in billions of dollars,
with Hong Kong $2.3 ($2.4 for June), Australia $1.7
($1.4), Singapore $1.2 ($1.0), and Egypt $0.4 ($0.3).
Deficits were recorded, in billions of dollars, with China
$27.0 ($26.7), OPEC $11.9 ($13.8), European Union $8.9
($9.8), Japan $5.3 ($4.0), Mexico  $4.9 ($6.4), Germany
$4.2 ($4.0), Canada $3.2 ($2.8), Nigeria $2.8 ($3.0),
Ireland $2.7 ($2.8), Venezuela $2.6 ($3.3), Taiwan $1.6
($1.8), and Korea $1.4 ($1.6).  Advanced technology products exports were $23.6 billion in

less than the $24.7 billion in June, while July imports
were $0.8 billion less than the $33.5 billion in June.  Revisions  Census Basis (not seasonally adjusted)
For June, exports of goods were virtually unrevised, and
imports of goods were revised down $0.5 billion. Goods
carry-over in July was $0.2 billion (0.2 percent) for
exports and $1.0 billion (0.6 percent) for imports.  For
June, revised export carry-over was $0.1 billion (0.1
percent), revised down from $0.2 billion (0.2 percent).
For June, revised import carry-over was $0.3 billion (0.2
percent), revised down from $1.7 billion (0.9 percent).  Balance of Payments Basis (seasonally adjusted)
Exports and imports of goods for January 2011 through June
2011 reflect the incorporation of more comprehensive and
revised quarterly and monthly data. For June, exports were
virtually unrevised and imports were revised down $0.6
billion.  Exports and imports of services for January 2011 through
June 2011 reflect the incorporation of more comprehensive
and revised quarterly and monthly data.  For exports of
services, the largest revisions were in royalties and
license fees.  For imports of services, upward revisions
in royalties and license fees and travel were mostly
offset by downward revisions in other private services.  Exports of services for June were revised up $1.0 billion
to $50.6 billion, mostly reflecting upward revisions in
royalties and license fees, travel, and passenger fares.
Imports of services for June were virtually unrevised at
$35.2 billion; upward revisions in most categories were
offset by a downward revision in other private services.  Addition of South Sudan
Effective with the release of August 2011 statistics on
October 13, 2011, the U.S. International Trade in Goods
and Services report will be revised to reflect South Sudan
as an independent country.  Sudan and South Sudan will be
listed individually in exhibit 6 of the FT-900 supplement.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
