South Africa ’s government has “no
intention” of regulating or legislating against the use of
 Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM) ’s Blackberry Messenger services,
Communications Minister Radhakrishna Roy Padayachie said.  “The minister, however, welcomes the willingness of
Research in Motion to work closely with government to prevent
the abuse of the encrypted messenger services by criminals for
unlawful purposes,” the Pretoria-based ministry said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The statement was issued to clarify comments made by
Communications Deputy Minister Obed Bapela, who called for
encryption codes on the Blackberry Messenger service to be made
available to the government, the ministry said. The government
is working on a policy statement, which will review current
regulations on “cyberspace matters,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
