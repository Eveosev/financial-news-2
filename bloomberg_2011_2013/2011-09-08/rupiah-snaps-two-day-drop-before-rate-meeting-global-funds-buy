Indonesia ’s rupiah rose, snapping a
two-day drop, as foreign investors boosted holdings of the
nation’s assets on prospects the economy can withstand a global
slowdown.  The currency rebounded from the weakest level in almost two
weeks reached yesterday as overseas holdings of the country’s
government bonds rose 26 percent this year to 247 trillion
rupiah ($28.9 billion) as of Sept. 5, debt management office
data show. Economists predict Bank Indonesia will leave its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 6.75 percent during a
policy meeting today to boost growth.  “We are seeing capital inflows attracted by good economic
fundamentals,” said Han Hao Li, an economist at Forecast Pte in
Singapore. “The trend for the rupiah is to strengthen in six
months to one year.  Bank Indonesia  doesn’t need to increase
interest rates as inflation is steady.”  The rupiah gained 0.1 percent to 8,556 against the dollar,
as of 8:20 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has climbed 4.9 percent this year, the second best
performer in Asia outside of Japan after the  Singapore dollar .
The currency touched 8,578 yesterday, the weakest level since
Aug. 26.  Consumer prices in Indonesia climbed 4.79 percent in August
from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 4.61 percent
in July that was the least since May 2010, the government said
this week. Gross domestic product will rise 6.5 percent this
year, the most since 1998, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
told lawmakers on Aug. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
