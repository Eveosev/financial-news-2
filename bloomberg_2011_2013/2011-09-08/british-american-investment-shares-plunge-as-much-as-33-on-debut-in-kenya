Shares in British American
Investment Co., a Kenyan financial-services company, fell as
much as 33 percent on debut on the  Nairobi Stock Exchange .  The stock was trading at 6.75 shilling at 11:36 a.m. in
Nairobi, compared with a starting price of 9 shillings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares earlier
traded as low as 6 shillings.  “Prices are falling as a reflection of the under-
subscription and due to the existing bear market,” Joseph Thiga, a trader at Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a
phone interview today.  British American’s initial public offering, the first such
share sale in  Kenya  since December 2008, was undersubscribed
with investors only bidding for 60 percent of the shares on
offer. The Nairobi bourse’s All Share index is Africa’s second-
worst performing equity gauge after Egypt, having fallen 33
percent so far this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
