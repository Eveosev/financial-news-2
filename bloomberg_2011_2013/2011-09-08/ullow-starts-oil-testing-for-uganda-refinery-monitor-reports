Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  started testing oil
in Uganda to help determine the design of a planned refinery in
the East African nation, the  Daily Monitor  reported, citing
Jimmy Kiberu, the spokesman of the Ugandan unit.  Tullow is extracting as much as 400 barrels of oil a day
from its Kagogole-1 well, and the testing will be extended to
the Kasamene-1A, Kigogole-3 and Ngiri-2 wells in two to three
months, the Kampala-based newspaper reported. The company plans
to start production by 2015, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
