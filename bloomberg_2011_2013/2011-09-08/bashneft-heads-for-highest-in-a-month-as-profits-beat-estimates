OAO Bashneft climbed to the
strongest level in more than a month after higher prices and
oil-product sales boosted second-quarter profit 44 percent from
the previous three-month period.  Shares of the oil producer controlled by Russian
billionaire  Vladimir Yevtushenkov â€™s AFK Sistema rose 1 percent
to $52 at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, their highest since
Aug. 4.  Net income climbed to $532 million from $370 million in the
first quarter, Bashneft said today in an e-mailed statement.
That beat the average estimate of $424 million from four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
