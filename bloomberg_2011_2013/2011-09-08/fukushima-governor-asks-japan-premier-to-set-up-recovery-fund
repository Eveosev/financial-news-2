Fukushima Governor Yuhei Sato asked
the central government to establish a disaster recovery fund
under the prefecture’s control to invest in reconstruction
projects after the March 11 earthquake and radiation disaster.  Sato made the request to Japan Prime Minister  Yoshihiko
Noda  who visited Fukushima prefecture and the crippled Dai-Ichi
nuclear power plant today for the first time since taking office
last week.  “We need a fund that Fukushima can use independently to
reconstruct the prefecture,” Sato said in a meeting this
evening with Noda. The size of the requested fund was not
disclosed and Noda said he would study the request.  Sato also restated to Noda that Fukushima prefecture
doesn’t want nuclear plants operating in the region in future
and that a thorough investigation is needed into the accident.  An earthquake and tsunami on March 11 caused meltdowns at
the plant north of Tokyo, triggering the worst nuclear accident
in 25 years. The catastrophe at the plant controlled by  Tokyo 
Electric Power Co. displaced about 50,000 households after
radiation leaked into the air, soil and sea.  Noda, who took the post of prime minister on Sept. 2, met
workers trying to contain radiation leaks from  Tokyo Electric ’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi station this morning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
