Liquidity standards proposed in
Basel 3 are “overly onerous” and will affect the ability of
banks to lend while also increasing the cost of borrowing,
Business Day said, citing  Standard Bank  Group Ltd. Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Sim Tshabalala.  Plans to tighten liquidity ratios for banks should not be
universally implemented in their existing form, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Tshabalala as saying.
Countries with well-regulated financial systems should not be
unfairly prejudiced by the changes, Tshabalala told the
newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
