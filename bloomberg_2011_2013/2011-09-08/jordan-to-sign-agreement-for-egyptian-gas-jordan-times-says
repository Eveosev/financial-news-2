Egypt will supply Jordan with 150
million cubic feet of natural gas per day under an agreement the
countries expect to sign within a week, the  Jordan Times  said,
citing the Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources.  Shipments are to reach 220 million cubic feet by 2012, the
newspaper reported, citing Khaled Toukan. Attacks this year on
the gas pipeline in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula forced Jordan’s
power plants to burn diesel and heavy oil instead of gas, at a
daily cost of around 3 million Jordanian Dinars ($4.2 million),
report said. Jordan relies on Egyptian gas to generate 80
percent of its electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
