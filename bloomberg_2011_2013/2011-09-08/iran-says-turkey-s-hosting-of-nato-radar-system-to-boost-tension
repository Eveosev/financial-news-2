Iran said neighboring Turkey’s
decision to host an early-warning radar as part of a North
Atlantic Treaty Organization defense system will add tension in
the region, the  Mehr  news agency reported.  “Strengthening NATO’s presence in the region in itself
creates insecurity and only results in the continuation of the
West’s imperialistic policies,” said Ramin Mehmanparast, an
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, according to a report today
by state-run Mehr news agency. “We expect friendly countries
and our neighbors to show more vigilance and by taking into
account the region’s interests, not pave the way for policies
that create tension and lead to complications.”  The deployment of the system in Turkey “will not serve
regional stability and security even for the host country,”
Mehmanparast said.  The radar will help protect against ballistic-missile
threats and is part of a strategic initiative agreed upon at a
NATO summit in Lisbon last year, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said
in a statement on Sept. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
