Jose Lobaton hit a homer and drove
in four runs as the Tampa Bay Rays defeated the Yankees 7-2 to
end New York’s five-game Major League Baseball winning streak.  Lobaton hit a three-run homer last night in the second
inning at Tropicana Field in  St. Petersburg , Florida. He added a
run-scoring single in the fourth to give the Rays a 6-1 lead.  Evan Longoria,  Matt Joyce  and  Ben Zobrist  added solo home
runs for Rays. All of Tampa’s homers came off Hiroki Kuroda (11-9), who gave up seven runs on nine hits in six innings.  Alfonso Soriano had a run-scoring single for the Yankees
and Robinson Cano drove in New York’s other run on a groundout.  Rays rookie Chris Archer (7-5) beat the Yankees for the
third time this season, giving up two runs on four hits in seven
innings.  The Yankees (68-60) are in fourth place in the American
League East, six games behind the Rays (73-53) and the  Boston
Red Sox  (75-55), who lost 2-0 to the Los Angeles Dodgers to lose
sole possession of the division lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
