A team from Chula Vista,  California ,
will play for the  Little League World Series  championship
tomorrow against a club from Tokyo.  At Lamade Stadium yesterday in Williamsport, Pennsylvania,
California defeated Westport,  Connecticut , 12-1 and Japan won
3-2 over Tijuana,  Mexico .  Chula Vista’s Nick Mora hit a three-run homer in the second
inning to give the team a 6-1 lead. He drove in a fourth run on
a single to left field in the sixth inning.  “When I was hitting, I wasn’t trying to hit a home run,”
Mora said. “I was just trying to hit a line drive up the
middle. That’s when the home runs come.”  Mora allowed one run on two hits, walked one and struck out
10 batters in 5 2/3 innings before reaching the pitch limit and
being replaced with one out in the sixth and final inning.  “I wanted that complete game,” Mora said. “I was kind of
disappointed. When I was pitching, I knew most of their
weaknesses and I was able to hit those spots.”  Tokyo ’s Takuma Gomi brought home the go-ahead run in the
sixth inning to give Japan the win over Mexico.  Connecticut will face Mexico in tomorrow’s consolation game
before Tokyo and California play for the championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
