The Wigan Warriors defeated Hull
16-0 in the lowest-scoring rugby league Challenge Cup final in
33 years.  Sam Tomkins and Iain Thornley scored the only tries at
rainy Wembley Stadium in  London  as Wigan won the knockout
competition for a record-extending 19th time. Pat Richards
kicked eight points for the Warriors.  It was the lowest-scoring final since Hull Kingston Rovers
beat Hull 10-5 in 1980.  Hull was seeking its first title since 2005 and its fourth
overall.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
