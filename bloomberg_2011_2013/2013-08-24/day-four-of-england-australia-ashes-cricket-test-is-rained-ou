Rain wiped out play on the fourth
day of the final Ashes cricket Test between England and
 Australia  at the Oval in  London .  No balls were bowled as overnight rain continued throughout
the day. Play was officially abandoned at 4:05 p.m. local time,
six hours after the scheduled start.  England is 247-4 in its first innings to trail by 245 runs.
Rain is forecast for much of tomorrow’s final day, leading to
the prospect of a second draw in the five-game series.  England has already won the Ashes urn, cricket’s oldest
trophy, holding an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
