Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the
Bank of  Japan (BOJDTR) ’s decision to step up stimulus is paying off in
the economy and financial markets.  The campaign “has started to exert effects,” Kuroda told
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual conference in
Jackson Hole,  Wyoming  today. Bond purchases have been “exerting
strong downward pressure on the nominal  interest rates .”  Japan ’s central bank is buying more than 7 trillion yen
($70.9 billion) in bonds each month to expand the monetary base
by 60 trillion yen to 70 trillion yen per year. It seeks to
generate inflation of 2 percent within two years after 15 years
of battling deflationary forces.  Kuroda said the push has helped boost stock prices and
restrain bond yields, while supporting bank lending and
bolstering confidence among consumers and businesses. Inflation
expectations are also picking up, he said.  “We think that at least in the next two years or so we would be able to
contain increases in long-term interest rates, so as to maintain low real interest
rates,” he said.  Consumer prices rose in June, and the world’s third-biggest
economy expanded at an annualized 2.6 percent in the three
months through June 30. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
is up 31 percent this year.  Japan will maintain the strategy “while continuing to make
efforts to maintain the stability of the global financial
system,” Kuroda said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
