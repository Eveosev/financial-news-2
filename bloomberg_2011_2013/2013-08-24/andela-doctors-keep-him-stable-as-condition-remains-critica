Doctors treating  Nelson Mandela , the
former South African president who led the struggle against
apartheid, have had to intervene to keep his condition stable,
according to the office of the presidency.  Mandela “is still critical but stable” in a Pretoria
hospital, President  Jacob Zuma ’s office said in a statement
today. “While at times, his condition becomes unstable, the
doctors indicate that the former president has demonstrated
great resilience and his condition tends to stabilize as a
result of medical interventions.”  Mandela turned 95 last month in the hospital where he has
been treated since June 8. The former president spent 27 years
in prison for his opposition to white minority rule, including
18 years on Robben Island, where he contracted tuberculosis.
This hospital stay is his fourth, and longest, since December.  Mandela won the Nobel Peace prize in 1993 and became the
nation’s first black president a year later when his African
National Congress party won elections. He stepped down in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
