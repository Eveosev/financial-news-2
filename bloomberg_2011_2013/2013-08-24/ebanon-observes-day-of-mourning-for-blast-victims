Lebanon marks a day of national
mourning after two blasts killed as many as 50 people during
Friday prayers in the northern city of Tripoli.  The explosions near two Sunni mosques also wounded 350, the
official  National News Agency  cited Mayor Nader Ghazal as
saying. At least 45 died and another 500 were injured, Lebanon’s
 Daily Star  said today.  Caretaker Prime Minister  Najib Mikati  announced the
decision to observe public mourning in memory of the victims,
NNA reported late yesterday.  The bombings at Tripoli, which shares its name with the
Libyan capital, occurred at a time of heightened tensions
between Sunni and Shiite communities as the sectarian war in
 Syria  spills into Lebanon. Tripoli has seen clashes between
supporters and opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  The two mosques hit yesterday are led by clerics who have
been supportive of the mostly Sunni rebels seeking to topple
Assad, who is Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. One blast
targeted Al Taqwa Mosque and the second hit near the entrance of
the Salam Mosque.  The two blasts were the third and fourth to hit Lebanon
since July. The previous two occurred in the Shiite militant
Hezbollah stronghold in  Beirut ’s southern suburb. The first
wounded more than 50, while the second killed at least 27
people.  Hezbollah has called the latest attacks a “terrorist” act
aiming at “dragging” the Lebanese into a civil war, according
to an e-mailed statement. “Hezbollah expresses extreme pain”
for the loss of life in Tripoli,’’ it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
