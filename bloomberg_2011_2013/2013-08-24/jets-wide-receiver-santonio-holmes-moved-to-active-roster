New York  Jets wide receiver  Santonio Holmes  was moved to the active roster from the physically unable
to perform list.  Holmes, 29, has been rehabbing since undergoing a pair of
offseason surgeries to fix a torn ligament in his left foot. He
suffered the Lisfranc injury against the  San Francisco 49ers  in
a National Football League game early last season.  The team has not said if Holmes will be ready to play in
the season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sept. 8.
He missed the final 12 games of last season.  “We’re all going to lean on the trainers and doctors, and
when they say he’s ready to go, he’ll be chomping at the bit, I
can tell you that right now,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said
yesterday. “I think he’s in great shape. Hopefully he can get
on the field soon.”  A first-round draft pick out of Ohio State University,
Holmes has 123 receptions for 1,672 yards and 15 touchdowns in
three seasons with the Jets. He was named the Super Bowl Most
Valuable Player following the 2008 season when he was a member
of the Pittsburgh Steelers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
