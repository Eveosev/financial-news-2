Iran ’s foreign Ministry warned
against any international military action in  Syria , its long-time ally, saying that intervention would heighten regional
tensions.  “There are no international authorizations for a military
intervention in Syria,” foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Araghchi was quoted as saying today by the state-run Iranian
Students' News Agency. “We warn against any moves or
announcements that would result in further tensions in the
region.”  Araghchi also questioned claims that Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad’s government used chemical weapons in an attack
opposition groups say killed 1,300 people, saying “evidence”
pointed to the fact that it had been carried out by “terrorist
groups” with the aim to implicate the Syrian government. “The
fact that they were used while UN inspectors were present is a
sign that some hands are at work to accuse the Syrian
government,” he said.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  is coming under increased
pressure to intervene in Syria amid allegations of chemical arms
use by Assad. In comments to reporters yesterday, Defense
Secretary Chuck Hagel indicated that U.S. military forces,
including naval vessels, are positioned in the Mediterranean and
ready to act if the president calls on the Pentagon to strike at
Syria.  “Provocative opinions by U.S. military officials or moves
such as positioning war ships won’t help resolve the issue and
will only endanger further the situation in the region,”
Araghchi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
