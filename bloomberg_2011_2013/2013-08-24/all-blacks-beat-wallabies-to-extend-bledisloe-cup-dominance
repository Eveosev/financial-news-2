New Zealand  beat Australia 27-16 in
the second round of the Rugby Championship to secure the
Bledisloe Cup for the 11th straight series with a game to spare.  Winger  Ben Smith  scored two tries for the All Blacks at
Wellington’s Westpac Stadium, while rookie fly-half Tom Taylor
kicked 14 points in his Test debut and Israel Dagg added a late
penalty. Israel Folau ran in an intercept try and Christian
Leali’ifano booted 11 points for the Wallabies, who last beat
the All Blacks in New Zealand in 2001.  “We were under the pump there for a while,” All Blacks
captain Richie McCaw said in a televised interview. “Our last
couple of weeks was by no means perfect, but it was a good
start.”  The victory gave the All Blacks an unbeatable 2-0 lead in
the three-match Bledisloe Cup series against  Australia , which
last held the trophy in 2002. It also keeps them tied atop the
southern hemisphere championship standings on nine points with
 South Africa , which won 22-17 in  Argentina .  Morne Steyn kicked five penalties and finished with 17
points to lead South Africa to the win in Mendoza. Bjorn Basson
scored the lone try for South Africa, while Juan Manuel
Leguizamon and Marcelo Bosch touched down for Argentina.  New Zealand hosts Argentina next in Hamilton on Sept. 7,
when the Wallabies face the Springboks in Brisbane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
