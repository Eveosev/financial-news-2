Any withdrawal of stimulus by the
Federal Reserve should be positive for  Brazil  because it would
show the U.S. economy is recovering, said Luiz Awazu Pereira,
deputy governor of Brazil’s central bank.  “For us, the exit from unconventional monetary policy was
perhaps a long-awaited, predictable process,” Awazu told the of
Kansas City Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
“The puzzle is why is it, with all this careful preparation,
things got a little bit out of hand.”  The Brazilian central bank this week sought to stem the
world’s worst currency decline, announcing a $60 billion
intervention program involving swaps and loans to prop up the
currency, the real, after it fell to a four-year low.  Emerging
markets  such as Brazil have been pressured in recent weeks as
Fed officials consider when to start reducing their $85 billion-a-month asset-buying program.  Brazil provided liquidity and created currency swaps so
that investors understand “there’s going to be available forex
for them to pay their bills,” said Awazu, the monetary
authority’s director for international affairs.  “The process of exit is a welcome transition to more
normal global monetary policy conditions,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
