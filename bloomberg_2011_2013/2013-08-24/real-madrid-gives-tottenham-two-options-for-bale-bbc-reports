Real  Madrid  has presented two
different offers to Tottenham for winger Gareth Bale, the
British Broadcasting Corp. reported on its website.  The first offer is for 86 million pounds ($134 million)
with structured payments over three to four years, the  BBC  said.
That would eclipse the world-record 80 million pounds Real paid
Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.  The second is for one payment of about 70 million pounds,
with the possible inclusion of a player, the BBC said. That
would also be a record total amount for a soccer transfer.  Bale, 24, was named the player of the year in the Premier
League last season by both his peers and the media. The European
soccer transfer period ends Sept. 2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
