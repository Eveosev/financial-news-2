Dean Meminger, who played with Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe on the  New York Knicks ’ 1973 National
Basketball Association championship team, was found dead
yesterday in a Manhattan hotel room. He was 65.  New York  City police said they had begun an investigation
into his death, according to the  Associated Press .  “From the day he was drafted by this franchise in 1971,
Dean was a friend and close family member of this team,” Knicks
General Manager Glen Grunwald said in a statement. “On April 5,
2013, the 1973 World Championship team was honored at Madison
Square Garden on its 40th anniversary -- there was no one
prouder than Dean to be back on the court with his teammates.”  Meminger, drafted out of Marquette University as the
Knicks’ first-round pick and 16th overall in 1971, averaged 6.1
points in six seasons with New York and the  Atlanta Hawks .  During three varsity seasons at Marquette, he averaged 18.8
points.  Meminger coached the New York Stars in the Women’s
Basketball League, the Albany Patroons in the Continental
Basketball Association and the Long Island Knights in the United
States Basketball League. He coached Manhattanville College in
2003-04.  “Dean ‘The Dream’ Meminger touched the hearts of so many
on and off the basketball court,” his family said in a
statement obtained by the AP. “Through basketball and
education, he helped countless people around the country receive
scholarships, high school and college admissions, and even
employment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
