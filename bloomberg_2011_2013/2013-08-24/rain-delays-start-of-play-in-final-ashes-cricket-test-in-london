Rain delayed the start of play on
day four of the final Ashes cricket Test between England and
Australia.  Play was to begin at 11 a.m. local time at the Oval in
London and the umpires brought the lunch break forward a half
hour to 12:30 p.m.  England will resume on 247-4, trailing by 245 runs.  Ian
Bell  is an unbeaten 29, with  Chris Woakes  15 not out.  England has already won the Ashes urn, cricketâ€™s oldest
trophy, holding an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
