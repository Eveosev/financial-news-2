Treasury yields touched two-year
highs as the U.S. employment market strengthened and minutes of
the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting showed policy makers
supported slowing the pace of asset purchases this year.  U.S. government securities pared losses yesterday, leaving
yields little changed on the week, as a drop in new home sales
in July reminded investors the economic expansion remains
uncertain. Treasuries due in 10  years  and longer have performed
the worst in the Group of Seven this month. The Treasury is
scheduled to auction $98 billion of notes next week.  “The Fed seems more disposed to tapering than the market
originally thought, and the economy is getting better, which
means higher yield for now,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who
oversees $2.1 billion as chief investment officer at United
Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. “Yields will remain
elevated, but we should hover near these levels as value hunters
will come in until we get more data that confirms the
strengthening economy.”  The U.S.  10-year yield  fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, on the week at 2.82 percent in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.5 percent note
due in August 2023 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face value,
to 97 8/32. The yield climbed to 2.93 percent on Aug. 22, the
highest since July 2011. It is still below its average of 3.54
percent in the past decade.  ’Expect Tapering’  The minutes released Aug. 21 showed Fed officials supported
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to start reducing stimulus under
quantitative easing later this year if the economy improves,
with a few saying it might be needed soon. U.S.-registered bond
funds lost $30.3 billion in August, a private report said.  “Almost all committee members agreed that a change in the
purchase program was not yet appropriate,” and a few said “it
might soon be time to slow somewhat the pace of purchases as
outlined in that plan,” according to the record of the Federal
Open Market Committee’s July 30-31 policy session.  “It does appear the markets are continuing to expect
tapering,” said  James Camp , managing director of fixed income
in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida , at Eagle Asset Management Inc.,
which oversees $27.8 billion. “The Fed wants out of QE. In the
near-term we see a 3 percent handle,” or yield of 3 percent on
the 10-year note, he said.  The number of jobless claims in the month ended Aug. 17
declined to 330,500 a week on average, the least since November
2007, a Labor Department report showed on Aug. 22. Compared with
a week earlier, claims rose by 13,000 to 336,000, in line with
the median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Home Sales  Sales (NHSLTOT)  of newly built homes declined 13.4 percent to a
394,000 annualized pace, the weakest since October, following a
455,000 rate in the prior period that was lower than previously
estimated, Commerce Department figures showed yesterday. The
median estimate of 74 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for a decrease to 487,000. Last month’s decline was the biggest
since May 2010.  A jump in borrowing costs over the past three months may be
prompting buyers to hold back, showing the difficult job ahead
for Fed officials as they try to wean the economy from monetary
stimulus while sustaining growth. The average rate on a 30-year,
fixed-rate purchase loan was 4.58 percent in the week ended Aug.
22, the highest in two years, according to McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac . The 30-year rate was at 3.35 percent in early
May compared with a record-low 3.31 percent in November.  Yield Curve  The  extra yield  10-year Treasuries offer over two-year
notes, known as the yield curve, expanded to as much as 2.55
percentage points on Aug. 22 the most since July 2011.  U.S. securities due in 10 years and longer tumbled 3.7
percent this month through Aug. 22, the biggest decline among G-7 nations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The Fed’s debate over when to taper $85 billion in monthly
bond buying has roiled financial markets around the world and
sparked a selloff in fixed-income assets. The central bank is
buying $45 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage
bonds each month. U.S. policy makers next meet on Sept. 17-18.  “Economic growth is continuing at a moderate pace,” said
Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which oversees $11 billion in fixed-income assets. “We’ve pretty much priced in the effects of the
Fed slowing down bond buying later this year.”  The U.S. central bank has kept its target for overnight
lending between banks at  almost zero  since December 2008.  Auction Reduction  The U.S. government is scheduled to sell $34 billion of
two-year notes on Aug. 27, $35 billion of five-year securities
the following day and $29 billion of seven-year debt on Aug. 29.  The U.S. is cutting the two-year auction by $1 billion, the
first reduction after selling $35 billion of the securities each
month since October 2010. The five- and seven-year auctions have
been unchanged since 2010.  The Treasury said on July 31 it expects to gradually
decrease coupon auction sizes during the coming quarter as the
nation’s fiscal health improves. The  federal budget   deficit  for
July was $97.6 billion, bringing the total for fiscal 2013,
which ends Sept. 30, to $607.4 billion. It was the lowest figure
for that stage of a fiscal year since 2008.  The Treasury sold $16 billion in five-year inflation-indexed securities on Aug. 22 at a yield of negative 0.127
percent, the highest since April, 2010, with investors wary of
paying a premium to guard against the threat of rising consumer
prices.  Taper Forecasts  “Investors are even less worried about inflation as we get
closer to tapering, because there will be less money in the
system,” said  George Goncalves , the head of interest-rate
strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., one of the 21 primary dealers
obligated to bid at government auctions.  Primary dealers, those companies that underwrite the  U.S.
debt , predict the Fed will reduce the pace of its asset
purchases in September by $15 billion, to $70 billion a month, a
July survey released this week showed.  Investors bid $2.89 for each dollar of the $1.345 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
