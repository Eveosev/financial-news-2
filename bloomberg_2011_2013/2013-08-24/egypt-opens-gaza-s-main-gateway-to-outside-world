Egypt opens Rafah crossing with  Gaza
Strip  in both directions,  Interior Ministry  says on website,
after allowing no one to leave or enter the Palestinian
territory for 5 days.

patients, dual nationals cross
* NOTE: Over past 10 days, Rafah crossing opened only twice, to
let Palestinians stranded on Egyptian side of border return to
homes in Gaza, controlled by Islamist Hamas movement

pattern following July 3 ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
* NOTE: Hamas is offshoot of Muslim Brotherhood group to which
Mursi belongs  To contact the reporter on this story:
