Egypt ’s prime minister said comments
by International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde acknowledge that Egypt needs assistance.  While domestic efforts to resolve the economic crisis are
paramount, “that doesn’t mean the IMF should be excluded,”
Hazem El Beblawi told reporters in Cairo today. “No wise
country would want to cut its relations with international
funding organizations.”  A $4.8 billion loan agreement with the IMF is an essential
part of efforts to revive economic growth, Planning Minister
Ashraf El-Arabi said on Aug. 5. Last week, he said talks had
been postponed as Egypt undergoes a bloody struggle between the
generals in charge of the nation and their Islamist opponents.  “We are very keen to support the Egyptian people in this
transition period, but clearly not all the ingredients are all
on the table,” Lagarde said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming  yesterday. “There needs to
be global political endorsement, there needs to be enough
stability for the policy commitments to be delivered. That is
not yet the case.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
