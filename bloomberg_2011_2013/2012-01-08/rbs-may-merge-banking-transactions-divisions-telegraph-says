Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  may
combine its  investment banking  and global transactions services
divisions, the Sunday Telegraph reported, without citing anyone.  The revamp, which may be announced this week, is part of an
effort to comply with a government requirement to separate
retail and investment banking businesses, the newspaper
reported.  RBS spokesman Michael Strachan declined to comment on the
report when Bloomberg called him today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
