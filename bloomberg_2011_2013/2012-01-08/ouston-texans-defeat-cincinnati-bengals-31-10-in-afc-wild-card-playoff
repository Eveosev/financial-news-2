Drew Brees  threw for 466 yards and
three touchdowns to lead the  New Orleans  Saints’ record-setting
offense to a 45-28 win over the  Detroit Lions  in a National
Football Conference wild-card game.  In an earlier American Football Conference game yesterday,
the Houston Texans defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 31-10 to
advance to the divisional playoffs against the  Baltimore Ravens 
on Jan. 15. The Saints will travel to  San Francisco  to play the
49ers on Jan. 14.  The Atlanta Falcons (10-6) visit the  New York Giants  (9-7)
in an NFC playoff game today, and the  Denver Broncos  (8-8) host
the Pittsburgh Steelers in an AFC contest.  The Saints accumulated 626 total yards to break the league
record for a postseason game held by the  San Diego Chargers , who
recorded 610 yards on Jan. 14, 1964.  New Orleans was behind 14-10 at halftime, scoring on Darren Sproles 2-yard run and John Kasay’s 24-yard field goal.  “What stopped us in the first half were those turnovers,”
Brees said in a televised postgame interview. “Going into the
locker room, we said we had to bear down on one play at a time
and one drive at a time. I think we scored on every drive in the
second half.”  Two minutes into the third quarter, Brees completed a 41-
yard pass to Devery Henderson and a 3-yard pass to Jimmy Graham
for a touchdown at 4:03.  Team That Believes  In the final quarter, Sproles ran 17 yards for a touchdown,
Robert Meachem scored on a 56-yard pass from Brees and Pierre Thomas plunged one yard for a score.  The Lions last made the playoffs in 1999 and last won a
playoff game in 1991.  Matthew Stafford completed 28 of 43 passing attempts for
380 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions for the Lions.  At Reliant Stadium in Houston, the Texans’  Arian Foster 
carried 24 times for 153 yards for two touchdowns, including an
8-yard run to tie the score at 7-7 in the first quarter. He
added a second score on a 42-yard run in the final quarter.  “This team believes,” Foster said in a post-game
interview. “I’ve never been on a team like this. We don’t need
anyone else to believe because we believe in ourselves.”  T.J. Yates completed 11 of 20 passing attempts for 159
yards and one touchdown. He completed a 40-yard pass to  Andre Johnson  in the third quarter to widen Houston’s lead to 24-10.  “The way we ran the ball today, it will be hard to stop us
in the playoffs,” Yates said. “We did a good job moving the
ball up and down the field all day.”  Andy Dalton  connected on 27 of 42 passing attempts for 257
yards and three interceptions, the last of which set up Foster’s
fourth-quarter touchdown.  Cedric Benson put the Bengals ahead 7-0 on a 1-yard run in
the first quarter. Mike Nugent kicked a 37-yard field goal
midway through the second for Cincinnati’s final score.  Neil Rackers kicked a 39-yard field goal with less than two
minutes left in the half to tie the score and J.J. Watt returned
a 29-yard interception to give the Texans a 17-10 halftime lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
