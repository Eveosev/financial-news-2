Egypt  plans to cut expenditures in
this fiscal year’s budget through reducing bonuses for
administrative employees by 10 percent and by lowering goods-
and-services spending 3 percent, according to an e-mailed
Finance Ministry statement today.  “It was decided to prohibit the purchase of non-domestic
products unless strictly necessary, in light of placed
allocations” and without affecting the reserves of basic goods,
the statement cited Finance Minister Momtaz El-Saieed as saying.
Advance payments of sealed contracts contributing to the
country’s investment projects are not to exceed 25 percent of
the contracts’ value, El-Saieed said, according to the
statement.  Egypt aims to reduce spending as it seeks aid from the
 International Monetary Fund . Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri
announced plans last month to reduce public spending by about 20
billion pounds ($3.3 billion). Finance Minister Momtaz El-Saieed
said Jan. 2 that he will stick to a budget deficit target of 8.6
percent of economic output in the fiscal year that ends June 30.
He also raised natural gas and electricity prices for energy-
intensive industries by about 33 percent.  Egypt’s reserves tumbled after the revolt that toppled
former President  Hosni Mubarak  in February. Foreign investors
sold $7.5 billion of Egyptian treasury bills and bonds through
the end of September, according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
