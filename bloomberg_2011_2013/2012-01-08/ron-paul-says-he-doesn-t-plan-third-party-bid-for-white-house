Republican presidential candidate  Ron Paul  said he doesn’t plan to begin a third-party bid for the
White House, although he didn’t rule out the possibility.  “I’m not an absolutist,” the Texas congressman said in an
interview that aired today on the “Fox News Sunday” program.
“Everyone knows I have no intention of doing that. It would be
a bit of a burden.”  Ahead of the Jan. 10 New Hampshire primary, Paul is trying
to convince voters that he is the best alternative to former
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Separate polls released Jan.
6 by NBC News and  Suffolk University  found Paul in second place,
and more than 20 percentage points behind Romney.  Paul’s libertarian views including opposition to the  Iraq
war  have set him apart from his rivals for the Republican
nomination. Still, he said he would need the support of
traditional Republican voters to win his party’s nomination.  “The message has to be across the board,” Paul said. “I
still have to attract the votes” of traditional Republicans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
