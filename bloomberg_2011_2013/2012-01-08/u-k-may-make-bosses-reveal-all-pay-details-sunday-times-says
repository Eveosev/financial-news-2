The U.K. government is preparing
measures to force chief executive officers at listed companies
to reveal complete details of their pay packages and to say how
much more they earn than their employees, the Sunday Times said.  Bosses will have to provide a single pay figure including
salary, share grants, retirement provisions and other perks,
under the proposals which Business Secretary Vince Cable will
reveal to representatives of the U.K.’s financial industry in a
week’s time before announcing them at the end of the month,
according to the Sunday Times.  Companies will also have to detail the difference between
their chief executive’s remuneration and that of their average
worker, the newspaper said, without saying where it obtained the
information. Other measures may give shareholders a binding vote
on executive pay and make companies reveal the percentage of
profits paid to directors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
