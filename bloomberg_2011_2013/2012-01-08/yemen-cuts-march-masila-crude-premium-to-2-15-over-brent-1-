Yemen cut the premium for March
shipments of  Masila Blend oil (PGCSMASI)  by 27 percent from a month
earlier, to $2.15 a barrel above the European benchmark Dated
Brent crude, the state oil committee said.  The Middle Eastern state will sell 2.5 million barrels of
Masila Blend to trader Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. at that price,
according to an e-mailed statement today from the state oil
committee. Yemen will issue a tender to sell the remaining
600,000 barrels of the grade available for purchase in March.  The March premium for Masila crude is lower than the price
of $2.93 a barrel Yemen charged above the Dated Brent price for
February cargoes. Yemen kept the premium for Marib Light grade
crude at parity with Dated Brent, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
