The  Arab League  called again on the
Syrian government and armed groups to end violence against
civilian demonstrators, withdraw troops from urban areas and
release political prisoners.  “The Syrian government is urged to immediately and fully
abide by its vows to execute the approved protocol in a way that
would guarantee security to Syrian civilians and does not
obstruct peaceful protests, in order for the delegation’s
mission to succeed,” the Cairo-based organization said today in
a statement handed to reporters in the Egyptian capital.  The League’s observers will continue their mission in  Syria 
as long as the government abides by the agreement, the statement
said. Arab League leader Nabil el-Arabi said today he expects to
receive a full report from monitors on Jan. 19.  “On the lights of the report to be presented on Jan. 19, a
decision will be made, after the committee meets, followed by a
ministerial meeting,” Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jaber al Thani said in a press conference in Cairo.
There is “no agreement to send foreigners as part of the Arab
League monitors,” he said.  Syrian anti-government fighters killed 11 members of
President Bashar al-Assad’s security forces in predawn clashes
in Daraa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in an e-
mailed statement today. The fighting in the southern governorate
of Daraa, where the 10-month uprising against Assad began, also
injured 20, the group said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
