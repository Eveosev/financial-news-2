U.K. budget retailer Peacocks plans
to sell its Bonmarche womenswear chain as part of a company
revamp, the Sunday Times reported.  Cardiff-based Peacocks may receive less than 10 million
pounds ($15.4 million) for Bonmarche, which it bought for 51
million pounds in 2002, the Sunday Times said, without saying
where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
