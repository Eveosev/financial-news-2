Europe should act on making its
bailout fund operational “quickly” and adopt bonds to fund
infrastructure investment in the region, Italian Prime Minister
 Mario Monti  told daily  Il Sole 24 Ore .  The European Stability Mechanism, or ESM, “must follow
lean procedures in order to be effectively usable” by
countries, Monti said in an interview with Sole today. Europe
should also use project bonds “to build transportation and
communications networks, such as broadband,” Monti said. On so-
called euro bonds, Monti said that there are “significant
divergences” within the region.  “A rapid improvement in the European governance will help
 interest rates  to drop,” making it easier for each nation to
carry out reforms, Monti told the newspaper.  The premier also said his government will soon take
measures to cut the costs of politics and bureaucracy in  Italy ,
