Dubai stocks retreated the most in
more than two weeks as investors await the release of full-year
results and after oil declined in  New York .  Air Arabia (AIRARABI)  PJSC, the  Middle East ’s largest discount
airline, decreased for the first time in four days and  Dubai
Investments PJSC (DIC) , the owner of stakes in more than 40 companies,
slumped 3 percent. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  fell 1 percent, the
most since Dec. 21, to 1,335.03 at the 2 p.m. close in the
emirate. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  slipped less than 0.1
percent.  “People are waiting for full-year and quarterly earnings
before making investment decisions,” said Ziad Dabbas, a
financial analyst at  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , the United
Arab Emirates’ second-largest lender by assets. “There is still
some concern over international market performance and volume is
weak as there are no positive catalysts.”  Air Arabia  may report (AIRARABI)  a 12 percent drop in full-year
earnings, according to the mean estimate of five analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. Higher fuel prices and political unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa led to a 26 percent decline
in the company’s third-quarter earnings. Shares in the airline,
which may report financial results on Feb. 18, fell 28 percent
in 2011. They dropped 1 percent to 58.8 fils today. Dubai
Investments, which said in November third-quarter income sank 88
percent, decreased the most since Nov. 21 to 61.1 fils.  Crude Falls  Emerging market stocks (MXEF)  declined 0.6 percent on Jan. 6 and
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  retreated 0.3 percent after
better-than-forecast jobs growth in the U.S. and a drop in the
 unemployment rate  failed to extend a weekly rally. Crude oil for
February delivery decreased 0.3 percent to $101.56 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on Jan. 6. Gulf Arab oil
exporters, including the U.A.E. and Qatar, supply about a fifth
of the world’s oil.  About 48 million shares  traded (VOLDFM)  in Dubai today, compared
with a 12-month daily average of about 100 million shares. The
DFM General Index fell 17 percent last year.  Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  climbed 0.2 percent
to 6,467.61, the highest close since Aug. 1.  Bank Albilad (ALBI)  rose
2.5 percent to 20.5 riyals, the highest since July 2010, after
Saudi Arabia’s second-smallest bank said fourth-quarter profit
surged to 107 million riyals ($29 million) from 4.5 million
riyals a year earlier.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  fell 0.6 percent and Kuwait’s  gauge (KWSEIDX) 
slipped less than 0.1 percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI) 
lost 0.5 percent, while Oman’s benchmark stock  index (MSM30)  rose 0.1
percent. Bahrain’s  measure (BHSEASI)  was unchanged. In North Africa,
Egypt’s market was closed for a holiday.  Israel’s TA-25 Index rose 0.1 percent at 2:43 p.m. in Tel
Aviv. The yield on the country’s 5.5 percent notes due January
2022 was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
