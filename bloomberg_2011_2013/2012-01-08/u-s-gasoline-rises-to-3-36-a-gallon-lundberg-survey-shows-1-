The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 12.03 cents to $3.3596 a
gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The price increase covers the three-week period ended Jan.
6 and is based on the Camarillo, California-based company’s
survey of about 2,500 stations.  It was the first increase in survey results since the
period that ended Oct. 21. Prices are 27.84 cents higher than a
year earlier, when the average was $3.0812.  “The price hike is more than the increase that retailers
received in wholesale prices,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of
Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in a telephone interview.
“Consumers are being shielded for now from 5 to 7 cents more in
price hikes.”  Prices rose as crude oil surged 8.6 percent and as a
government subsidy on ethanol expired Dec. 31. The subsidy,
enacted in 1978, gave a 45-cent tax credit to refiners for each
gallon of the biofuel blended into gasoline.  “Wholesale prices were up 19.5 cents and at least part of
the wholesale price increase came from the cancellation of the
ethanol subsidy,” Lundberg said yesterday. “It looks as though
if crude  oil prices  didn’t reverse themselves, we would see an
additional five to 7 cents” a gallon for gasoline.  Gasoline for February delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 26.46 cents, or 11 percent, to $2.7516 a gallon in
the three weeks ended Jan. 6.  Stockpiles Rose  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles (DOESTMGS)  jumped 2.48 million barrels to
220.2 million in the week ended Dec. 30, according to the Energy
Department. Inventories were up 7.8 percent since Nov. 4 after
climbing for six out of eight weeks.  Demand , or deliveries to wholesalers, during the past four
weeks was 4.9 percent below a year earlier while overall fuel
supplied was down 7.2 percent.  Gasoline demand at the pump in the week ended Dec. 30 sank
14 percent from the prior week to the lowest in more than seven
years of records, according to  MasterCard (MA)  Inc.’s SpendingPulse
report on Jan. 4. Demand during the previous four weeks was 3.4
percent below a year earlier.  The front-month crude oil contract gained $8.03, or 8.6
percent, in the three weeks ended Jan. 6 to settle at $101.56.  Crude May Fall  Crude prices may fall this week on speculation that  Iran 
won’t block the  Strait of Hormuz  and as the European debt crisis
weakens the euro against the dollar, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Fifteen of 32 analysts, or 47 percent, forecast oil will
slide through Jan. 13. Fourteen respondents, or 44 percent,
predicted a gain and three estimated there will be little
change. Last week, 41 percent of analysts projected a drop.  Crude oil  supplies (DOESCRUD)  rose 2.21 million barrels to 329.7
million in the seven days through Dec. 30, according to the
Energy Department.  Inventories (DOESCROK)  at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for New York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil,
fell 2 percent to 29.3 million, the lowest level since November
2009.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline averaged $3.60 a gallon in
the latest survey, Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail
stations averaged $3.69 a gallon, which was the highest price in
the lower 48 U.S. states among the cities surveyed.  The lowest price was in  Salt Lake City , where a gallon
averaged $2.86, Lundberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
