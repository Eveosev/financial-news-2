A Nigerian soldier was injured in a
firefight between military forces and suspected members of
Islamic militant group, Boko Haram, in a market in the
northeastern city of Maiduguri, according to the field
operations officer of the military joint  task force  in the area.  “Gunmen opened fire on a patrol vehicle and our men had to
defend themselves and we have arrested some of the suspects,”
Victor Ebhaleme said by phone today. Boko Haram, which means
“Western education is a sin,” says it’s fighting to establish
Islamic law in the entire country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
