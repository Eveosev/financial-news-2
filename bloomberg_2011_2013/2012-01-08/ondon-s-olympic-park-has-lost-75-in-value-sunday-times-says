London ’s Olympic Park had lost 75
percent of its value by the time of a valuation in 2009, raising
doubts over plans to sell it for as much as 2 billion pounds
($3.1 billion) after this year’s summer games, the Sunday Times
reported.  The park, which contains the Olympic stadium, an aquatic
centre and 250 acres of parkland and was bought for more than
750 million pounds, was valued at 138 million pounds if sold to
one developer and 157 million pounds if sold in lots, according
to the report by Jones Lang LaSalle quoted by the newspaper.  Former London Mayor  Ken Livingstone  had said the park would
be worth from 1 billion to 2 billion pounds after the games,
when it would be sold to pay back debts to the National Lottery
and the government.  The London Games start July 27.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
