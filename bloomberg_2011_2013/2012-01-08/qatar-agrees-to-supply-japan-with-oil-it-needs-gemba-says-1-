Qatar  will supply  Japan  with the
“oil it needs” in light of the situation with  Iran , Koichiro Gemba, Japan’s foreign minister, told reporters in the Qatari
capital of Doha today.  The European Union is weighing a ban this month on
purchases of Iranian oil after the U.S. tightened sanctions at
the end of last year. The Islamic Republic conducted 10 days of
naval maneuvers east of Hormuz ending Jan. 3 and warned it would
block the strait if prevented from selling its oil, according to
Iranian state-run news agencies. The country plans even bigger
military maneuvers in the area next month, the state-run Fars
news agency reported Jan. 5.  Japan relied on Qatar for 12 percent of its crude imports
in 2009, making it the third-largest supplier behind  Saudi
Arabia  and the  United Arab Emirates , according to  U.S. Energy
Department data . Gemba, who is on a regional tour of the Persian
Gulf, spoke in a press conference with Qatar’s Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah.  Japan asked Saudi Arabia to provide more crude oil to
compensate for any loss in shipments from Iran, al-Watan
reported, citing a foreign ministry spokesman.  Qatar, the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas producer,
also supplies LNG to Japan, the biggest importer of the fuel.
Qatar raised LNG exports to Japan after a March 11 earthquake
reduced nuclear power output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
