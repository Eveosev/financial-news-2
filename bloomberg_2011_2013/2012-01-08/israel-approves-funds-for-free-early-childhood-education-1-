Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s cabinet approved changes to the 2012 budget,
including funding to support free early childhood education and
afternoon daycare.  The plan was approved by a vote of 21 to 8, according to a
text message sent today by the prime minister’s office. It makes
education free for children from the age of 3, instead of 5.
“We are not breaking the budget framework,” Netanyahu said
today in an earlier statement.  Netanyahu has been under pressure to increase spending for
education and social welfare following demonstrations by
hundreds of thousands of Israelis this summer against the high
cost of living. The premier appointed a committee led by  Manuel Trajtenberg  that recommended trimming defense spending and
increasing benefits for families with small children.  To contact the reporter on this story:
