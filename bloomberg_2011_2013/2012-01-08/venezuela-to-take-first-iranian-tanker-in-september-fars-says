of 113,000 metric tons, Iranâ€™s Fars news agency reported.  A total of four Aframax-sized tankers of the same capacity
are under construction with Iran Marine Industrial Co., known as
Sadra, and will be delivered to Venezuela, state-run Fars

Aframax tankers at the company. The ships are valued at 52
million euros ($66.12 million) each and are the first of their
