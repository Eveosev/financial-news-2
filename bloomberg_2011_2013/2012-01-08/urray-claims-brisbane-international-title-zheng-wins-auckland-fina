Andy Murray  warmed up for the
Australian Open with a straight sets win against Alexandr
Dolgopolov in the Brisbane International tennis final today.  Murray defeated Ukraine’s Dolgopolov 6-1, 6-3 in 65 minutes
to claim a 22nd ATP title. The 24-year-old this month started
working with new coach  Ivan Lendl .  “It’s my first week with this new team and it was good,”
Murray told the British Broadcasting Corp. “I really enjoyed
it. Hopefully it’ll bring more success in the future.”  The Britain, runner-up at the Australian Open the past two
years, is aiming to win a first Grand Slam title. This was his
final match before the tournament begins on Jan. 16.  Yesterday, Estonia’s  Kaia Kanepi  beat Slovakia’s Daniela Hantuchova to take the women’s title in Brisbane. Kanepi won 6-
2, 6-1.  China’s Zheng Jie won the Auckland Classic today when
Flavia Pennetta of Italy quit their match with an injury in the
third set. Zheng was leading 2-6, 6-3, 2-0 in the final, which
had been held over from yesterday because of heavy rain.  In an all-French final yesterday, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga
defeated Gael Monfils 7-5, 6-3 at the Qatar Open in Doha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
