French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
narrowed challenger  Francois Hollande ’s lead in opinion polls,
according to an Ifop survey in Le Journal du Dimanche today.  The Socialist Hollande leads the incumbent in a head-to-
head contest by 54 percent to 46 percent, a 4 point swing in
Sarkozy’s favor from last month, the poll showed. Sarkozy gained
2 points and Hollande lost 2 points.  In the multi-candidate knockout voting round, Hollande
would take 28 percent, up by 1/2 a point, and Sarkozy would win
26 percent, up 2 points. National Front candidate Marine Le Pen
would get 19 percent, down one point.  The Ifop survey questioned 1,163 registered voters between
Jan. 4 and Jan. 6. No margin of error was provided.  The first voting round will be held April 22 and the
decisive contest is set for May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
