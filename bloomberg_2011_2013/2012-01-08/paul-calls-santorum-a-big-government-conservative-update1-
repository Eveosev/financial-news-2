U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of
 Texas , touting his opposition to spending bills in  Washington ,
said in a debate of the Republican candidates for president that
former Senator  Rick Santorum  of  Pennsylvania  is “a big-
government conservative” who supported excessive spending.  Santorum responded by calling Paul’s comments “a
ridiculous charge.” He also defended the money he steered to
his state while in Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
