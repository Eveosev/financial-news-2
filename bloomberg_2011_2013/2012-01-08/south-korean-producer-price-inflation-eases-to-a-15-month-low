South Korean producer prices rose at
the slowest pace in 15 months in December as vegetable and fruit
costs declined.  Prices (KOPPIYOY)  climbed 4.3 percent from a year earlier, after a 5.1
percent increase in November, the  Bank of Korea  said in a
statement from Seoul today. They rose 0.2 percent from November.
The cost of fruit fell 26 percent last month from a year earlier
and that of vegetables dropped 13 percent, the bank said.  The central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged at 3.25
percent in December for a sixth straight month to shield growth
as Europe’s fiscal crisis threatens to curb global expansion.
The consumer inflation rate was 4.2 percent in December,
breaching the central bank’s target limit of 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
