(Corrects date in seventh paragraph.)  Israel ’s consumer price-linked bonds
rose to the highest level in more than three weeks amid investor
bets inflation will accelerate as electricity prices rise.  The yield on the CPI-linked bond due June 2013 dropped four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.56 percent at 11:45
a.m. in Tel Aviv, the lowest since Dec. 15. The  two-year break-
even rate (ILGGBE02) , the rate difference between inflation-linked bonds
and fixed-rate government bonds of similar maturity, gained one
basis point to 190. That implies an average annual inflation
rate of 1.90 percent.  Electricity prices surged 4.7 percent in November, after
attacks on a  gas pipeline  from  Egypt  interrupted supply, raising
input costs for power production. Israel will extend the reduced
 tax rate  on diesel fuel for power production by one year to help
keep a planned increase in electricity prices to a minimum, the
 Finance Ministry  said Jan. 5.  “Electricity prices, which are expected to increase by 9
percent in February, will boost inflationary pressure in coming
months,” said Gil Chen, a bond trader at I.B.I.-Israel
Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  Consumer prices rose 2.6 percent in November from a year
earlier, the smallest increase in a year, the  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said Dec. 15. The government’s target range is
between 1 percent to 3 percent.  Israel plans to auction 200 million shekels ($52 million)
in 30-year bonds tomorrow, the longest maturity in the local
market.  The yield on the 5.5 percent notes due January 2022 rose
one basis point to 4.52 percent. Two-year  interest-rate swaps (ISSW2) ,
an indicator of investor expectations for rates over the period,
rose two basis points to 2.46 percent on Jan. 6.  The  Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index (TEL-B40) , which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, fell less than 0.1 percent. The
shekel, down 7.5 percent last year, its worst performance since
2001, weakened 0.2 percent to 3.8527 a dollar on Jan. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
