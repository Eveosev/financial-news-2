Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the
Munich-based Ifo economic institute, said  Germany  is being
“marginalized” in the European Central Bank,  Der Spiegel 
reported, citing an interview.  The fact that the nation now provides neither the bank’s
president nor its chief economist illustrates the loss of
influence, the magazine cited Sinn as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
