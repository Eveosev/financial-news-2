Euro-zone countries plan to make
coordination of economic policies mandatory by making it part of
 European Union law ,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing the latest
draft of a new EU contract.  The draft foresees stronger integration of the euro-zone
interior market and would force governments to discuss economic
reforms with each other before enacting them, according to the
report. The plan also contains stricter rules on budget deficits
and debt loads, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
