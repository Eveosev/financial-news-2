The  Philippines  said the death toll
from a landslide that hit a gold-mining community has climbed to
31 people, underscoring the risks of unlicensed prospecting.  The number of dead has risen from 25 when the disaster
struck on Jan. 5 in Compostela Valley in the southern province
of Mindanao, Colonel Leopoldo Galon, a spokesman of the
military’s eastern command, said in a mobile-phone text message
today. There are still 39 people missing, he said.  As many as 80 percent of 200,000 to 300,000 small-scale
miners in the nation are operating without permits, with the
desire for profit luring them back to Compostela even after
earlier evacuations, Mines and Geosciences Bureau Director Leo
Jasareno said in a phone interview today.  “If you ask them to choose between farming and mining for
gold, they would definitely go for the latter,” he said.  A miner can earn between 2,000 pesos ($45) and 2,500 pesos
per gram of gold and would consider himself unlucky if he found
only a gram each day in Compostela, Jasareno said. The minimum
wage in the capital is less than 500 pesos.  A landslide in  April 2011  killed 14 in Compostela,
according to disaster management agency data. Another took the
lives of five people in the valley last month following heavy
rains caused by Tropical Storm Washi.  About 3,700 communities in the Philippines are vulnerable
to landslides, Jasareno said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
