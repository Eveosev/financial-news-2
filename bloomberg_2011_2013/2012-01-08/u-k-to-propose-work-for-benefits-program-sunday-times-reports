The U.K. coalition government is
planning a compulsory community work program for the long-term
unemployed, the Sunday Times said, citing Employment Minister
Chris Grayling.  The plan will include stopping benefits for as many as
three years for those who refuse to sign up, the newspaper said.
Grayling has indicated his support for the plan, saying a “work
for dole” program will help curb the U.K.’s expenditure on
benefits for the jobless, the paper said.  People who have been  unemployed (UKUEILOR)  for three years or more
will be forced to work unpaid for six months under the terms of
the program, the Sunday Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
