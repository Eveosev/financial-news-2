Louis Oosthuizen won golf’s Africa
Open title for a second straight year, finishing two shots ahead
of Tjaart van der Walt in East London,  South Africa .  The 29-year-old, who shared the overnight lead with fellow
South African Van der Walt, was 27-under-par for the tournament,
the opening event of the European Tour season.  Retief Goosen finished on 24-under, with Jaco van Zyl
another shot back as South Africans took the top four spots. Van
der Walt, 37, is still waiting for a first career title.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
