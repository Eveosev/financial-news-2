Oil rose for the first day in three,
climbing as much as 59 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $102.15 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Crude for February delivery was at $101.93 at 10:05
a.m. Sydney time.  A pipeline that would allow oil from the  United Arab
Emirates  to bypass the  Strait of Hormuz  separating it from  Iran 
has been delayed because of construction difficulties, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  The 1.5 million barrel-a-day link would ensure the U.A.E.
can export crude without risking a blockade at Hormuz, where
fully laden tankers exit the  Persian Gulf  with one-fifth of the
worldâ€™s traded oil. The chance that Iran might try to close the
waterway has intensified as  Europe  prepares to follow tougher
U.S. sanctions on the country.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
