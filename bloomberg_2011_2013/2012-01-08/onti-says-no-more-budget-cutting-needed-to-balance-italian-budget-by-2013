The Italian government will not have
to carry out an additional package of budget cutting measures to
meet its goal of eliminating its deficit in 2013, Prime
Minister  Mario Monti  said.  His government will now focus on producing a package of
measures to spur economic growth and competitiveness in  Italy  to
be presented before a meeting of European Union finance chiefs
on Jan. 23, Monti said on the “Che Tempo Che Fa” talk show on
state-owned RAI television.  Monti said that the plan would seek to “modernize” the
country’s labor market to create more employment and
opportunities for young people.  The government will work on “many fronts” to spur
competion through opening up closed professions, he said. Monti,
who leads an unelected government of non-politicians, said he is
well positioned to force people to give up some of their
priviliges because he has no natural constituency to protect.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
