Chelsea midfielder  Frank Lampard  will
be allowed to leave during this monthâ€™s transfer window, but
only if he moves to a soccer club outside of England,  the People
reported.   Paris Saint-Germain may be interested in the 33-year-old,
who will be available on a free transfer because Chelsea wants
to cut its wage bill, the newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Chelsea does not want Lampard to join a rival and rejected
an approach from Manchester United on Jan. 5, the People
reported.  Lampard is reluctant to join a team in Major League Soccer,
although the  Los Angeles Galaxy  is interested, the newspaper
added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
