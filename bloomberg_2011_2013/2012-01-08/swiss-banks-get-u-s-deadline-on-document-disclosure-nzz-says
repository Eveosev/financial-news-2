The U.S.  Justice Department  set a
deadline of Jan. 23 for 11 Swiss banks to disclose information
on all transactions with U.S. customers since 2000, Neue
Zuercher Zeitung reported, citing bankers it didn’t identify.  The banks may provide the department with a version of the
documents in which customers’ names are blacked out, while
giving an uncensored version to the Swiss Financial Market
Authority, the Zurich-based newspaper said. The U.S. government
would have to prove fraud to get access to the names, according
to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
