Regulators and lenders in the U.S.,
European Union and  Japan  are to face “detailed” peer reviews
of their implementation of international bank capital rules,
global regulators said.  All member countries of the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  have agreed to undergo the assessments, the group’s
governing board said in a statement on its website. The results
of the reviews, to begin in the first quarter of 2012, will be
published, it said.  The EU, U.S. and Japan will be the first to be assessed, it
said. The reviews will include examining how lenders value their
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
