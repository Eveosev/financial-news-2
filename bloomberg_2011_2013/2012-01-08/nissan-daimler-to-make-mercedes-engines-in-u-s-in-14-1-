Nissan Motor Co. and  Daimler AG (DAI)  will
build four-cylinder Mercedes-Benz engines beginning in 2014 at a
Nissan plant in Tennessee, the first Mercedes engines made in
 North America .  The engines will be used in Mercedes and Infiniti models,
the companies said in an e-mailed statement. The engines for
Mercedes will be used in C-Class models being built at Daimler’s
factory near Tuscaloosa,  Alabama .  Nissan-Renault and Daimler first announced plans in April
2010 to share development costs, engines and small-car
technologies to take on Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp. The
latest project will bring Daimler’s Mercedes and Smart brands
closer to Renault’s small cars and Nissan’s Infiniti range.  Nissan-Renault isn’t “commenting on the scope of the
expansion,” or whether additional workers will be hired, said
Rachel Konrad, a spokeswoman.  The plant in Decherd,  Tennessee , which is about 67 miles
(107 kilometers) northwest of Chattanooga, began production in
1997. It builds 4-,6- and 8-cylinder engines for U.S.-
manufactured Nissan and Infiniti vehicles, Nissan said. Last
year, Decherd made more than 580,000 engines, the company said.  The Nissan-Daimler engine venture is expected to produce
250,000 engines annually once full output is reached, the
companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
