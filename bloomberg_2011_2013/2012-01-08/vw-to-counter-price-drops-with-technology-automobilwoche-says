Volkswagen AG (VOW3)  Chief Executive Officer
 Martin Winterkorn  plans to invest in technology for lighter and
more fuel-efficient cars to avoid becoming engulfed in pricing
battles with competitors amid potentially weakening demand,
Automobilwoche reported, citing an internal memo.  The carmaker will reshape itself with “new technologies
and models, in new markets, with new factories and investments
on an unprecedented scale,” Winterkorn told top executives in
the memo, according to Automobilwoche.  To contact the reporter on this story:
