Bill Parcells , a former coach of the
 New York Giants  and Jets, is among 15 modern-era finalists who
will be considered for inclusion in the 2012 class to be
inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Parcells, 70, who retired from coaching in 2006, needs a
positive vote of at least 80 percent to be elected by the 44-
member Selection Committee, which meets in Indianapolis on Feb.
4. The results will be announced at 5:30 p.m. EST on NFL-Network
live from the Super Bowl Media Center.  Parcells coached the Giants (1983-90), the  New England
Patriots  (1993-96), Jets (1997-99) and  Dallas Cowboys  (2003-06).
He was a finalist in 2001 and 2002 after he retired as head
coach of the Jets, although at that time, he wasnâ€™t covered by
Hall of Fame rules that require a coach to be retired for five
seasons before being eligible.  Besides Parcells, the finalists for the 50th class of Hall
of Famers, which include two senior nominees, are running back
 Jerome Bettis , wide receiver Tim Brown, cornerback Jack Butler,
wide receiver Cris Carter, center Dermontti Dawson, San
Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr., defensive end Chris Doleman and linebacker Kevin Greene.  Candidates also include defensive end Charles Haley,
defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy, running back Curtis Martin,
wide receiver Andre Reed, tackle Willie Roaf, guard Will Shields, guard Dick Stanfel and cornerback Aeneas Williams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
