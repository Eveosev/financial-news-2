Italy  will push ahead with market
liberalizations and measures to boost economic growth, Economic
Development Minister  Corrado Passera  told  Corriere della Sera .  “We’ll go ahead in all sectors: gas, energy, commerce,
transports, professional associations,” the newspaper cited
Passera as saying in an interview.  Passera ruled out new taxes and said Italy has to cut
expenses of the public administration and fight tax evasion
instead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
