Paul Scholes  has reversed his
decision to retire from soccer and rejoined the playing staff at
 Manchester United  with immediate effect.  “It’s fantastic that Paul has made this decision,” United
manager  Alex Ferguson   told the club’s website . “It’s always sad
to see great players end their careers, but especially so when
they do it early.”  Scholes, 37, quit playing at the end of last season after
making 676 appearances for United and winning the Premier League
title 10 times. He has since been on the club’s coaching staff.  His return will bolster Ferguson’s options in midfield.
Darren Fletcher is on an “extended break” because of
ulcerative colitis, a chronic bowel condition, while Anderson
and Tom Cleverley have both suffered from injuries this season.  “I’ve been pretty clear since I stopped playing that I
miss it,” Scholes told United’s website. “I’m delighted the
manager feels I can still make a contribution to the team and
I’m looking forward to playing my part in trying to bring more
success to this great club.”  Scholes also made 66 appearances for the England national
team, scoring 13 times, and played at the 1998 and 2002 World
Cup finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
