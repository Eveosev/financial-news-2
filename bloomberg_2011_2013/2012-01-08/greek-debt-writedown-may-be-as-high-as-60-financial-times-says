Private creditors holding Greek
government bonds are set to accept a writedown of 55 percent to
60 percent of their holding, the  Financial Times  reported,

lower  Greece ’s debt would be more than a 50 percent writedown
agreed as part of a debt swap agreed in October, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
