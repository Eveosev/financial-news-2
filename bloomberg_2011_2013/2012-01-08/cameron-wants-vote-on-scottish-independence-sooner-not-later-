U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said that a referendum on Scottish independence should be held
“sooner rather than later.”  “It’s unfair on the Scottish people themselves, who don’t
really know when this question is going to be asked, what it is
going to be,” Cameron told the British Broadcasting Corp.’s
“Marr” program today. “We’ll be making clear in the coming
days what the legal situation is.”  Scotland ’s First Minister Alex Salmond has pledged to hold
a referendum on whether the country should become independent in
the second half of his five-year term. Salmond’s Scottish
National Party, which is seeking to drum up support for
independence, won an unprecedented majority in last May’s
elections to the devolved parliament in Edinburgh.  Both the coalition’s Conservative and Liberal Democrat
parties, as well as the opposition  Labour Party , want Scotland
to remain part of the U.K.  Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that
delaying the vote was hurting the Scottish economy.  “I believe very strongly that Scotland is better off, that
there are more opportunities for Scottish people within the
U.K.,” he told  Sky News  today. “Scotland cannot afford a long
period of dithering and delay from Alex Salmond.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
