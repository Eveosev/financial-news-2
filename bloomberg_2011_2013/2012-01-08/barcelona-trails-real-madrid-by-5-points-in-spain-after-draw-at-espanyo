Barcelona was held to a 1-1 draw by
city rival Espanyol as Spanish soccer’s La Liga resumed after
the midseason break. AC Milan and Juventus both won to remain
tied on points atop  Italy ’s Serie A.  Cesc Fabregas gave Barcelona the lead in the 16th minute
last night before Alvaro Vazquez’s 86th-minute header tied the
scores. Barca’s Gerard Pique hit the post in the second minute
of stoppage time and Espanyol survived a penalty appeal when the
shot from the rebound struck a defender on the arm.  The draw leaves Barcelona five points behind league leader
 Real Madrid , which has 43 points through 17 games. Two days ago,
Karim Benzema scored twice to help Madrid defeat Granada 5-1,
while third-place Valencia rallied from two goals behind to tie
2-2 at Villarreal yesterday. Fourth-place Levante drew 0-0
against Real Mallorca.  First-place AC Milan and Juventus both have 37 points in
Serie A, two more than Udinese, which beat Cesena 4-1 yesterday.  Zlatan Ibrahimovic gave Milan a 22nd-minute lead at
Atalanta from a penalty kick, with Kevin-Prince Boateng scoring
after 82 minutes to secure a 2-0 victory. Alessandro Matri gave
Juventus a 1-0 win at Lecce.  Lazio remains on 30 points after a 4-0 loss at Siena two
days ago, with  Inter Milan  one point back following a 5-0
victory against Parma.  The French, German and Dutch leagues are still on their
winter break.  T*
