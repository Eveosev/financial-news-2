Klaus Regling, who heads the European
Financial Stability Facility, plans to offer potential investors
in the fund a guarantee of as much as 30 percent on their
investment, rather than the 20 percent currently offered,  Bild-
Zeitung  reported.  The current insurance rate isn’t enough given the risk
involved, the newspaper said, citing comments made by Regling to
policymakers of the German  Christian Social Union  at Wildbad
Kreuth in  Bavaria  last week. The CSU belongs to Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s ruling coalition.  Separately, the German government is considering an earlier
start of the planned European Stability Mechanism program, Bild
cited unidentified people in the government as saying. European
states may add the scheduled 80 billion euros ($102 billion) to
the pool in one move rather than in installments or raise the
amount to 100 billion euros, Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
