Republican presidential candidate
Newt Gingrich said he doesn’t think that rival Mitt Romney can
defeat President  Barack Obama  in the November election.  “I don’t believe” that Romney, the former governor of
Massachusetts, is electable, Gingrich said at the beginning of a
Republican candidates’ debate sponsored today by NBC News and
Facebook in Concord,  New Hampshire . “The bigger the contrast,”
Gingrich said, “the clearer the choice, the harder it is for
that billion-dollar campaign to smear his way back into
office.”  “I think he will have a very hard time getting elected,”
Gingrich, a former U.S. House speaker, said of Romney when
pressed.  Romney, in response, said he’s “very proud” of his
conservative record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
