Iran  plans to increase daily crude
oil exports to  Japan  to 240,000 barrels in 2012, Tehran Times
said, citing Mohsen Qamsari, head of international affairs at
the state-owned National Iranian Oil Co.  Iran’s oil exports to Japan declined by 100,000 barrels a
day last year, Qamsari said, without giving an export figure.
He cited Japan’s decision to reduce oil imports to 3.5 million
barrels a day from 5.5 million barrels earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
