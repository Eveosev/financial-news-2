Portugal’s  consumer price index 
rose in February from a year earlier at a slower pace than
recorded in January.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
climbed 0.2 percent from a year earlier, less than the 0.4
percent increase in January, the Lisbon-based National
Statistics Institute said today in an e-mailed statement. Prices
fell 0.1 percent from January.  Using the statistics institute’s own methods, consumer
prices in Portugal were unchanged in February from a year
earlier and also declined 0.1 percent from January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
