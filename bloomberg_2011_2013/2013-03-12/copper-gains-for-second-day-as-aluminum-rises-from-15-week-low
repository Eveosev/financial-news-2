Copper gained for a second day as
aluminum, zinc and lead rebounded from the lowest level in about
15 weeks amid speculation that recent declines in prices will
attract buyers from  China .  Copper for delivery in three months climbed as much as 0.3
percent to $7,784.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,778 at 10:01 a.m.  Shanghai  time. Zinc rose
0.9 percent to $1,978 a ton, after falling to $1,928 yesterday,
the lowest since Nov. 23, while aluminum added 0.6 percent to
$1,962.50 a ton, after declining to a 15-week low of $1,934.85
yesterday.  China is holding a once-a-decade leadership transition at
the annual National People’s Congress in Beijing, which is to be
completed on March 17. The congress usually leads to an increase
in approvals of infrastructure projects.  “Now is a good time to buy,” Zhang Tianfeng, an analyst
at Dongxing Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. Investors
expect an increase infrastructure spending in the next few
months, Zhang said.  Copper for June delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained 0.6 percent to 56,800  yuan  ($9,128) a ton, while May
futures on the Comex in New York rose 0.3 percent to $3.528 a
pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
