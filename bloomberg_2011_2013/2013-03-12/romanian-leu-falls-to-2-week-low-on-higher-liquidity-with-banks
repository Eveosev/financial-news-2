Romania ’s leu weakened to the
lowest level in two weeks after the central bank extended a
policy of unrestricted currency supply at a repurchase auction
yesterday.  The leu pared its advance this year after the Banca
Nationala a Romaniei scrapped a cap on the size of its repo
auction last week and continued with its policy of lending to
commercial banks without limits yesterday. It lent 2.3 billion
lei to eight commercial banks, less than the 7.3 billion at last
week’s auction.  The “leu declined, echoing generous liquidity conditions,
as the central bank relinquished the cap on the repo again,”
analysts at  BRD-Groupe Societe Generale (BRD)  SA, including Bucharest-
based Roxana Hulea, wrote in a note today.  The leu weakened more than 0.1 percent to 4.3751 per euro
by 4:50 p.m. in Bucharest, the lowest level on a closing basis
since Feb. 26. It lost 0.4 percent yesterday, cutting its gain
this year to 1.7 percent.  The increased liquidity pushed Romania’s interbank offered
rate, or ROBOR, to the lowest level in three weeks at 5.03
percent, below the central bank’s key interest rate of 5.25
percent.  Romania’s inflation rate declined to 5.7 percent in
February, matching the median estimate of 12 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg, as a stronger currency capped prices for food and
services.  To contact the reporters on this story:
