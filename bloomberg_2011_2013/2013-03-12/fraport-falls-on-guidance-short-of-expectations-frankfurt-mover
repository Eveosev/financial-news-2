Fraport AG, the operator of
 Europe ’s third-largest airport, declined the most in more than
four months after the company said operating profit in 2013 will
fall short of analysts’ expectations.  Fraport said today earning before interest and taxes,
depreciation and amortization will rise to 870 million euros
($1.13 billion) to 890 million euros this year, below the
average of 917 million euros from 24 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Net income will fall, while the number of passengers
at  Frankfurt  airport will remain stable, the company said.  “The given outlook is slightly disappointing” on both
operating profit and Frankfurt passenger growth,  Jochen Rothenbacher , an analyst at Equinet Bank, said in a note to
clients, adding he might cut his forecast “slightly” after
today’s analyst meeting.  The shares fell as much as 4.6 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Nov. 9, and traded down 3.6 percent at 43.41
euros at 11.30 a.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the airport operator
at 4 billion euros.  Fraport said 2012 Ebitda rose 6 percent to 850.7 million
euros, matching the average analyst estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
