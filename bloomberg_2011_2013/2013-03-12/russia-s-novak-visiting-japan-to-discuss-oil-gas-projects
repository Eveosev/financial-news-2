Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak will meet  Japan ’s Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry
Toshimitsu Motegi tomorrow in Tokyo to discuss cooperation in
oil and gas projects, the ministry said in an e-mail.  Novak is also scheduled to meet officials at Japanese
energy companies to discuss the planned $20 billion Yamal LNG
plant and other projects, said four people with knowledge of the
meetings. They asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  Russian billionaire Leonid Mikhelson will accompany Novak
on the trip, one of the people said. Mikhelson is chief
executive officer of  OAO Novatek (NVTK) , which holds 80 percent of the
Yamal project.  Total SA (FP)  is a partner in the plan to build the
LNG plant by 2017 in  Russia ’s arctic region. Novatek, Russia’s
biggest gas producer after OAO Gazprom, may seek investors in
the project, two of the people said.  The Russian company may offer a stake in the Yamal project
to Chinese companies, two people with knowledge of the matter
said in February. Novatek is also in talks with companies
including  Electricite de France SA  about participating,
Mikhelson said in January.  The Russian company is in an advanced talks on LNG sales
from Yamal and about 80 percent of the gas is ready for signing
contracts, Mikhelson said yesterday on a conference call.  To contact the reporters on this story:
