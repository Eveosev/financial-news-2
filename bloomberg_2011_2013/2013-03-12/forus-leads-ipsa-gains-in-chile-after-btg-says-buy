Forus SA (FORUS) , a Chilean retailer of
Columbia clothes and Nine West shoes, surged to a record after
Grupo BTG Pactual recommended the stock as a bet on rising
demand by South American consumers.  Forus rose 2.1 percent to 3,011 pesos at 1:32 p.m. in
Santiago, the  highest price  on a closing basis since the stock
started trading in 2006, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Forus was the biggest gainer today on  Chile ’s
benchmark  Ipsa (IPSA)  index, which fell 0.4 percent.  BTG initiated  coverage  of Santiago-based Forus with a buy
recommendation and a 12-month price target of 3,445 pesos,
according to an e-mailed report yesterday. The brokerage firm
estimated consumer demand will grow 4 percent to 6 percent this
year in  Peru , Colombia, Chile and Uruguay while Forus will reap
gains from 70 stores opened in 2011 and 2012.  “While Chile continues to be Forus’s primary market, over
time we expect that Peru, Colombia and Uruguay will represent a
bigger piece of the pie,” analysts Isabel Darrigrandi, Alonso Aramburu and Fabio Monteiro wrote in the note. “Forus continues
to ramp up its operations in these countries.”  Forus plans to open 35 to 40 stores this year, BTG said.
Forus doesn’t operate credit cards, has no associated  default
risk  and leases its stores instead of buying, which results in a
“light” balance sheet, BTG said.  The retailer trades at  21 times  estimated 2013 earnings,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil’s Arezzo
Industria e Comercio SA, a comparable company according to BTG,
trades at 26 times estimated 2013 earnings.  Forus rallied 95 percent last year, the best performance on
the Ipsa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
