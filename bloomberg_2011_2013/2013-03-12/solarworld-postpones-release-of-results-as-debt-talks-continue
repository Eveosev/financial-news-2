Solarworld AG (SWV) ,  Germany ’s biggest
solar-panel maker, postponed the release of its 2012 financial
report as talks with creditors over its debt continue.  Solarworld delayed the release scheduled March 21 to an
unspecified date in the future due to “ongoing restructuring
negotiations with its creditors,” the Bonn-based company said
today in a statement.  “Talks with creditors are proceeding constructively,”
Solarworld said. It’s working on a “restructuring concept”
with German law firm  Goerg  and Los Angeles-based financial
adviser Houlihan Lokey, it said.  Competition mainly from Chinese companies cut solar panel
prices by half in 2011 and another 24 percent last year. That
tipped more than a dozen companies into bankruptcy including
 Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and Q-Cells, once the world’s largest
producer of power-generating cells.  Solarworld, which said in January it needs to make
“serious adjustments” to its debt structure, has lost money in
four of the past five quarters and reported net debt of 805.2
million euros ($1.05 billion) at the end of September. It has
150 million euros of bonds due in 2016, and 400 million euros of
bonds due in 2017, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
