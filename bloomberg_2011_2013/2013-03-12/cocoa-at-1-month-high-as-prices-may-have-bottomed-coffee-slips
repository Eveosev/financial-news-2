Cocoa futures climbed to a three-
week high on signs of reduced deliveries by farmers in  Ivory
Coast , the world’s biggest producer.  Orange juice  and cotton
also gained, while coffee slid. Sugar was unchanged.  Purchases of  cocoa beans  by the Ivory Coast government fell
7.5 percent in the first three months of the season that began
in October, according to a document sent to Bloomberg by an
official in the ministries of finance and agriculture.
Deliveries to ports from farms slid to 649,249 metric tons,
compared with 702,127 tons a year earlier, the data show.  “This should allow prices to work higher as there will be
less cocoa on the market,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist
at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago, said in an e-mail.
Supplies in the Ivory Coast are getting tighter, and some beans
have poor quality, Smith said.  Cocoa for May delivery rose 1.3 percent to settle at $2,158
a ton at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , after touching
$2,176, the highest for a most-active contract since Feb. 14.
Prices are up 5.7 percent in the past four sessions, the longest
rally since Dec. 3.  Also in New York, orange-juice futures for delivery in May
rose 0.9 percent to $1.375 a pound, the fourth straight gain.
Cotton futures for May delivery jumped 0.7 percent to 87.33
cents a pound, the ninth gain in 11 sessions.  Arabica-coffee futures for delivery in May slid 1 percent
to $1.4235 a pound, the biggest decline in a week.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery closed unchanged at
18.82 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
