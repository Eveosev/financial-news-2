The U.S. Energy Information
Administration  reduced its crude-oil price and global
consumption projections for 2013.  West Texas Intermediate oil will average  $91.92 a barrel 
this year, down 1 percent from the February estimate of $92.81,
the Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm, said today in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook. The U.S. benchmark grade will average $92.17 in 2014,
unchanged from the previous month’s estimate.  Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half the world’s
crude, will average $108.33 a barrel in 2013, down $1 from last
month’s forecast. The average cost of domestic and imported
grades used by U.S. refiners will be $96.62 a barrel this year,
down 88 cents from the February projection of $97.50. Brent will
drop to $100.75 a barrel next year and the average cost for
refineries will slip to $96.91 in 2014, the EIA said.  WTI crude for April delivery rose 75 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $92.81 a barrel at 1:04 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Brent oil for April settlement dropped 32 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $109.90 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Brent’s premium to WTI shrank to as narrow as
$16.94, the least since Jan. 31.  WTI-Brent Spread  The spread between Brent and WTI, which will average about
$16 a barrel this year, will narrow to $9 in 2014. The Brent
premium will shrink because increasing pipeline capacity will
lower the cost of shipping oil from the central U.S. to
refineries on the  Gulf Coast , according to the report.  U.S. production was forecast to gain 0.8 percent this year
to 7.31 million barrels a day, the report showed. The 2014
estimate jumped to 7.88 million from 7.82 million.  The EIA  decreased its forecast  for global oil consumption
this year to 90.13 million barrels a day from 90.21 million
estimated last month. World demand will climb to 91.53 million
in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
