The Philadelphia Eagles released
cornerback  Nnamdi Asomugha  as the National Football League’s
free-agent signing period began.  Asomugha had joined the team in 2011 as the Eagles’
management was building what it thought was a Super Bowl
contender. Philadelphia hasn’t made the playoffs since then and
the team fired coach Andy Reid after last season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
