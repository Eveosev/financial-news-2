Fiat SpA (F)  is raising 1.25 billion
euros ($1.6 billion) from its first sale of bonds in the
currency since July, helping spur the busiest start to a year
for euro debt issuance from carmakers since 2009.  Fiat is selling high-yield notes due in five years at 6.625
percent, according to a person familiar with the matter. The
deal lifts sales from carmakers to 11.5 billion euros this year,
compared with 10.7 billion euros during the same period in 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The issuance comes as European automakers face a sixth year
of slumping sales. Turin-based Fiat said on Jan. 30 it may raise
as much as 5 billion euros in bonds by the end of 2014 to
“optimize the management” of debt, which totals 15.8 billion
euros, according to Bloomberg data.  “Autos is an industry facing secular pressure in  Europe ,
compounded by the macro pressure,” said Mitch Reznick who helps
oversee about $41 billion at Hermes Fund Managers Ltd. in
London. “The impact of these pressures is mitigated for Fiat by
the company’s low leverage, market access, high cash balances
and access to credit lines.”  Richard Gadeselli, a spokesman for Fiat, declined to
comment on the bond sale.  Chrysler Support  Fiat’s new bonds are provisionally rated B1, four steps
below investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service and one
step higher at BB- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings.  The carmaker last sold securities in the single currency on
July 11, when it raised 1 billion euros from 7.75 percent bonds
due October 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Those notes
have since climbed 5.8 cents on the euro, outperforming the
average increase of 0.6 cents among European carmakers that sold
debt in euros and pounds since January 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The average premium investors demand to hold Fiat’s debt
rather than government bonds is 423 basis points, compared with
513 basis points for securities in Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s Euro High Yield Constrained Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
