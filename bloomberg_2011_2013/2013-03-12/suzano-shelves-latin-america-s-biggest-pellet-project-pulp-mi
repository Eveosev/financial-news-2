Suzano Papel e Celulose SA ,
 Brazil ’s most indebted pulpmaker, will suspend investments in
the region’s biggest biomass-pellet project and its Piaui pulp
plant as it seeks to cut debt.  The projects will be shelved until the company lowers its
net debt to 2.5 times its earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, Walter Schalka, chief executive
officer for the  Salvador , Brazil-based company, said today in an
earnings call. Its fourth-quarter net debt was five times
Ebitda.  Suzano will focus on extracting value from existing assets
and bringing its Maranhao pulp factory online by the end of the
year, almost doubling its production capacity for the paper raw
material, Schalka said.  “The company is not comfortable with the current level of
debt and is taking action to correct that,” he said.  Suzano may sell 250 million reais ($127 million) of non-
operating assets and expects debt levels to fall after it starts
operating the Maranhao project, which will require 2.3 billion
reais of investment this year, he said.  Suzano  said  in July 2010 it would invest $800 million in
three pellet plants and forests in the northeast.  “This would have been the biggest pellet-export project in
 Latin America  by a massive margin,” David Hostert, an analyst
at Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s London office, said today in
an e-mail. “They would have been the first in the region to do
this on a large scale.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
