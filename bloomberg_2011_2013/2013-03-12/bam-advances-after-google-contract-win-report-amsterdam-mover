Royal BAM Group NV (BAMNB)  rose to the
highest price in almost a year after reports that the largest
Dutch builder by market capitalization won a contract to build
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s European headquarters in  London .  BAM  jumped  as much as 6.9 percent to 3.65 euros, the
highest intraday price in Amsterdam trading since March 29.
Google’s 1 billion-pound ($1.49 billion) headquarters in London
will be built by Bunnik, Netherlands-based BAM, the Financial
Times reported late yesterday, without citing anyone.  BAM is one of the parties seeking to build Google’s new
headquarters, with expected construction costs of about 250
million pounds to 300 million pounds, BAM said in an e-mailed
statement today. It’s up to Google to announce which party has
been selected as preferred bidder, BAM said.  “The contract confirms BAM’s strong position as builder of
large buildings” and will increase its visibility in the U.K.
in coming years, Edwin de Jong, an Amsterdam-based analyst at
SNS Securities, wrote in a note to investors. De Jong has a buy
recommendation on BAM shares.  The shares were up 3.9 percent at 3.54 euros as of 12:07
p.m., giving the company a market value of 857 million euros
($1.11 billion).  Construction will probably start this year, with work
scheduled to be completed in 2016, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
