Syniverse Holdings Inc. offered
concessions to European Union regulators in an effort to allay
antitrust concerns over its plans to buy Mach, a competing
provider of services to mobile-phone companies.  Syniverse submitted the offer on March 11, the European
Commission said in a  filing  on its website today. It didn’t give
details of the company’s proposal. The EU must rule on the deal
by May 30.  Syniverse said last week that the EU sent it an antitrust
complaint listing possible competition problems with the deal’s
effect on markets for data clearing and near real-time roaming
data exchange. Syniverse, owned by  Carlyle Group LP (CG) ,  agreed  to
buy Luxembourg-based rival Mach for about 550 million euros
($717 million) in July.  Companies can offer to sell units or change the way they do
business in order to win regulators’ approval and eliminate
concerns that a deal will expand their control of a market and
harm competition with rivals or increase prices for customers.  Bobby Eagle, a spokesman for Tampa, Florida-based
Syniverse, declined to comment on the commitments. He said the
company is “unable to share specific details” on the
transaction beyond its public filings.  The EU opened an in-depth probe in December, saying the
merger may hamper competition by forming the largest data-
clearing house “by a very wide margin” for settling usage
records for consumers making calls or using data on telephone
networks for telecommunications providers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
