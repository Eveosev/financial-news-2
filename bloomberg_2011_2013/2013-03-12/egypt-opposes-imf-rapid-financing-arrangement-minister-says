Egypt doesn’t plan to seek a $750
million emergency loan from the  International Monetary Fund , the
country’s finance minister said.  “The government will not accept this type of loan because
its problems outweigh its benefits,” El-Morsy El-Sayed Hegazi
said in Cairo today. “The government doesn’t need the rapid
loan offered by our brothers in the IMF.”  The program that Egypt submitted to the fund to secure a
$4.8 billion loan is “strong,” he said.  Egypt has the option of requesting rapid funding under an
IMF lending program before reaching a broader loan agreement,
Wafa Amr, an IMF spokeswoman, said yesterday. It’s up to
Egyptian authorities to decide whether to request support under
the fund’s Rapid Financing Instrument, which offers “rapid—but
limited—financial assistance to member countries facing an
urgent balance of payments need,” she said.  The political bickering and tensions marring  Egypt ’s
transition since the 2011 uprising have prolonged its bid to
complete the $4.8 billion loan agreement with the fund, which
government officials say is necessary to boost investor
confidence and unlock other funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
