Boeing Co. (BA)  received initial
approval from U.S. regulators to test its proposed changes to
the 787 Dreamliner’s batteries, the first step toward resuming
flights of a plane grounded worldwide for almost two months.  It’s unclear when the 787 will begin carrying passengers
again. Boeing must perform tests to ensure that the battery’s
new design meets safety regulations, and the agency could insist
on more design changes, Federal Aviation Administrator Michael
Huerta told Congress Feb. 28.  Still, the decision creates a path to return the 787 to
service and signals the lithium-ion battery issues aren’t fatal
to Chicago-based Boeing’s most sophisticated model. The
worldwide fleet of 49 Dreamliners has been parked since Jan. 16
following two incidents of batteries overheating and smoking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
