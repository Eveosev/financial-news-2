Hurricane Fly, ridden by  Ruby
Walsh , became the first horse in 38 years to regain his title in
the Champion Hurdle, the main event on the opening day of
England’s Cheltenham horseracing festival.  The 13-8 favorite, a nine-year-old trained by Willie
Mullins, won the event in 2011 and is the first horse since
Comedy Of Errors in 1975 to recapture the hurdling crown. Rock
On Ruby (11-2), last year’s winner, was second with Countrywide
Flame (16-1) third.  Hurricane Fly overtook long-time leader Rock On Ruby before
the final fence and held on to the lead without being troubled.
The two-mile, 110-yard race carried a top prize of 227,800
pounds ($339,000).  “I can’t say I was overly confident, from the word ‘go’ he
didn’t travel as well as he can,” Walsh told reporters. “He’s
an unbelievably big heart for a small horse. He made a mistake
or two, but he’s as tough as nails.”  Walsh and Mullins also won the first race, the Supreme
Novices’ Hurdle, with Champagne Fever at 5-1, and completed a
treble with 8-11 favorite Quevega in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle.  The start of the meeting was delayed to allow the course to
thaw out after freezing weather overnight, when covers were used
to combat frost. The four-day festival in western  England  is one
of the biggest events in U.K. jumps racing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
