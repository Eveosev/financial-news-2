Chile’s peso rose to a three-week
high on a surge in copper, which accounts for more than half of
the Andean country’s exports.  The currency touched a level stronger than 471 per dollar
for the first time since Feb. 18, appreciating as much as 0.2
percent to 470.91 before trading little changed at 471.25 at
12:01 p.m. in Santiago. Copper for May delivery rose as much as
1.7 percent to $3.5760 a pound, the biggest increase on an
intraday basis since January.  “Copper’s pretty high,” said Ronald Volpi, the head of
spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago. “These are levels to buy the dollar. It’s a good
place to get back in.”  Copper rose after passenger vehicle sales in  China  had
their strongest start to the year since 2010. China is the
biggest customer for Chilean copper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
