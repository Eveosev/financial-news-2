Qatar Airways  Ltd, the second-
biggest Gulf carrier, said it will receive seven new freight
aircraft this year as it expands its cargo-carrying capacity by
40 percent.  The airline has already received a new  Airbus A330 , Chief
Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said at a conference in the
Qatari capital of Doha. Two more A330s will be delivered in the
coming weeks and three additional by the end of the year. The
company will also receive a Boeing 777 freighter by the middle
of the year and will phase out three A300s, he said.  “We look forward to being among the top five air cargo
operators in the world within the next five years,”  Al Baker 
said in a statement.  Cargo transport, which is growing at 20 percent a year,
accounts for 28 percent of Qatar Airway’s revenue, Al Baker
said. The airline will start using a new $1 billion cargo
complex on April 8 at the new $16 billion Hamad International
Airport, which opens April 1.  The carrier’s cargo capacity will rise by 530 tons a day
when the seven planes are received, Al Baker said. Qatar seeks
to become a Persian Gulf transport hub before hosting the 2022
 World Cup  of soccer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
