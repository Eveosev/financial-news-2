EBay Inc. (EBAY) , operator of the world’s
largest online marketplace, fell the most in five months after
ChannelAdvisor Corp. said February sales grew at the slowest
pace since April 2011 as consumers bought fewer car parts.  The shares decreased less than 1 percent to $52.40 at 10:17
a.m. in  New York , and earlier touched $50.90 for the biggest
decline since Oct. 9. Through yesterday, the  stock  had advanced
3.5 percent this year, compared with a 9.1 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  So-called same store sales grew 8.2 percent at EBay in
February from a year earlier, ChannelAdvisor said in a statement
today. After accounting for an extra sales day from the leap
year in 2012, revenue growth was 12 percent. Auto parts and
accessories sales climbed 6.8 percent, “the slowest measurement
we’ve seen since breaking out EBay details,” ChannelAdvisor
said, citing a spate of winter storms that caused consumers to
postpone work on their cars.  After accounting for the leap year,  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  posted
a 35 percent gain in same store sales, about 1 percentage point
higher than the growth the world’s biggest online retailer
posted in January, ChannelAdvisor said.  “February saw a few speed bumps for e-commerce between the
tough leap-year comparison, macro  consumer confidence  concerns
and a plethora of winter storms,” ChannelAdvisor said in the
statement. “Given that backdrop, Amazon came in particularly
strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
