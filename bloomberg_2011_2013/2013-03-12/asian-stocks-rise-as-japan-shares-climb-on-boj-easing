Asian  stocks  fell from a 19-month
high as Chinese shares extended their decline.  Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. (1662)  surged after Japan confirmed it has extracted
frozen natural gas from under the seabed.  China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , the nation’s biggest shipping
company, dropped 5.3 percent after Citigroup Inc. said the sale
of its logistics unit means the loss of a stable, growing
business.  Whitehaven Coal Ltd. (WHC) , Australia’s second-biggest
independent coal producer, sank 5.5 percent on government plans
for stricter coal mining approvals. Japan Petroleum, the
country’s second-largest oil and gas explorer, surged 5.7
percent after Japan confirmed gas output from methane hydrate,
known as “burnable ice.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.3 percent to 136.11 as
of 9:16 p.m. in Tokyo after rising as much as 0.3 percent. More
than twice as many stocks fell as gained on the measure, which
closed yesterday at the highest level since August 2011.  “Shares have risen a lot already, and there’s a short-term
risk of a pull-back,” said Takashi Aoki, a Tokyo-based fund
manager at Mizuho Asset Management Co., which oversees about $38
billion. “The global economy is recovering steadily, led by the
U.S. China is growing at a cruising speed rather than continued
acceleration, so you shouldn’t have excessively high hopes.”  The regional gauge advanced about 12 percent from the start
of November through yesterday, led by Japanese shares as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe pursues policies to beat deflation and
pressures the central bank to ease monetary policy.  Relative Value  Asia’s benchmark index traded at 15.2 times estimated
earnings as of yesterday compared with 14.1 for the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and 12.7 for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  fell 0.1 percent today. The index
rose 0.3 percent at the close of trading in New York yesterday
to be within nine points of its record high.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  retreated 0.3 percent,
reversing a gain of as much as 0.9 percent. BOJ deputy-governor
nominee Kikuo Iwata said in parliament that decisive monetary
easing was needed to pull the country out of deflation.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slipped 0.9 percent, with
trading volume 11 percent below its 30-day average for the time
of day. China’s Shanghai Composite Index fell 1 percent,
reversing an earlier gain of 1 percent and capping its longest
losing streak since November.  Cosco Falls  South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.5 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 0.6 percent, led by utility and energy
companies. Taiwan’s Taiex Index slumped 0.6 percent while
Singapore’s Straits Times Index gained 0.3 percent.  China Cosco slumped 5.3 percent to HK$4.08. The company
said it plans to sell its logistic unit to its parent to improve
financial results. The company may gain 2.4 billion ($386
million) to 4.6 billion  yuan  from the sale, but will lose a
growing business in the long run, Citigroup said.  China Life Insurance Co., the nation’s biggest insurer,
slumped 1.7 percent to 17.58 yuan in Shanghai as shares resumed
trading after being suspended amid comments by its chairman on
this year’s earnings. Chairman Yang Mingsheng’s comment that
profit will “surely” improve in 2013 referred to the company’s
parent, China Life said in a statement yesterday.  China Railway Group Ltd. and China Railway Construction
Corp., the nation’s two biggest train line builders, fell at
least 5.1 percent in Hong Kong. China’s plan to dismantle its
rail ministry is market-oriented and pro-competition, and
companies that have enjoyed government support will be affected,
SinoPac Securities Asia Ltd. analyst Vivian Liu said.  Datang Slump  China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) , a coal and wind power
producer, slid 5.7 percent to HK$6.51.  China Datang (1798)  Corp.
Renewable Power Co., a state-owned wind-energy developer,
declined 3.1 percent to HK$1.56.  Credit Suisse Group AG cut their rating to neutral from
outperform after China Longyuan surged 44 percent from mid-
November through March 8, while China Datang more than doubled.
Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index climbed 9.4 percent during
the period.  Whitehaven sank 5.5 percent to A$2.39, declining for a 10th
time in 11 days. Australia’s government plans to make the
approval process for coal-seam gas and coal mining projects more
stringent to ensure protection of water resources, according to
Environment Minister Tony Burke.  AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK)  and Santos Ltd., Australian energy
companies whose coal-seam gas projects have faced opposition
from some environmental groups and farmers, dropped at least 1.6
percent.  Methane Hydrates  Japan Petroleum Exploration surged 5.7 percent to 4,175 yen
in Tokyo, its highest close since April 2011 and the second-
 biggest gain  in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Japan confirmed gas
output from methane hydrate buried under the seabed off the
coast of Japan’s main island of Honshu.  Modec Inc. (6269) , a maker of
floating production systems for the offshore oil and gas
