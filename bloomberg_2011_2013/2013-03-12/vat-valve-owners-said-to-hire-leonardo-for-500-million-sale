VAT Valve ’s family owners have
hired Leonardo Inc. as an adviser to help sell the Swiss
vacuum-valve maker priced at more than $500 million, according
to two people with knowledge of the situation.  VAT Valve has annual sales of more than $300 million and
may attract bids from  OC Oerlikon (OERL)  Corp. of  Switzerland ,  Eaton
Corp. (ETN) , and private-equity investors, said one of the people, who
asked not to be identified because the process is private.  The planned sale of the Haag-based company, which employs
about 1,000, follows the death of its founder Siegfried
Schertler in 2010. VAT Valve has moved into components for the
flat screen and photovoltaic markets under Richard Fischer, who
took over running of the business in 1984.  Spokespeople for VAT Valve and Leonardo couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.  Oerlikon could raise 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.27
billion) for takeovers if needed, Chief Executive Officer
Michael Buscher said in a March 5 interview. The focus is on
adding assets to existing units making vacuum pumps and coatings
for cars. Oerlikon head of investor relations Andreas
Schwarzwaelder declined to comment on any speculation.  Eaton highlighted March 1 it will continue to look at
potential targets as they come up. Eaton spokesman Gary Klasen
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
