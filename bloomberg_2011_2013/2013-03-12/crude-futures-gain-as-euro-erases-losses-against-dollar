West Texas Intermediate advanced,
narrowing its discount to  Brent crude  to the lowest level in
more than five weeks, as the euro trimmed losses against the
dollar and OPEC increased production.  WTI gained for a fourth day as the euro stayed above $1.30.
Brent’s premium to WTI narrowed for a fifth session, dropping to
$17.11 a barrel from $20.79 in that time. Brent fell 0.5 percent
after OPEC boosted output to the most in three months in
February. WTI futures open interest reached a record yesterday
in  New York .  “The real move is in that Brent-WTI spread,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital
Advisors. “Oil is following currencies. I won’t be surprised to
see that spread narrow a little bit more.”  WTI for April delivery gained 48 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
settle at $92.54 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices are up 0.8 percent this year. Volume was 36 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day at 4:41 p.m.  Oil was little changed after the  American Petroleum
Institute  reported U.S. inventories dropped 1.38 million barrels
last week to 377.6 million. April futures gained 54 cents to
$92.60 in electronic trading at 4:41 p.m. Prices were at $92.58
before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent for April settlement dropped 57 cents to $109.65 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. Volume
was 30 percent above the 100-day average. Brent’s premium to WTI
shrank to $17.11, the lowest level since Jan. 30. The spread was
$23.18 on Feb. 8.  Narrowing Gap  The gap between Brent and WTI, which will average about $16
a barrel this year, will narrow to $9 in 2014 as new pipeline
capacity lowers the cost of moving crude to  Gulf Coast  refiners
from the central U.S., the Energy Information Administration,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said in a monthly
report today.  The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3026 after dropping as low
as $1.2991. The currency decreased to $1.2955 on March 8, the
weakest level since December. A stronger euro and weaker dollar
increase the appeal of investing in oil.  “This currency move is the dominant force right now,”
said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a  New York- 
based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “It’s been quite a
reversal here in currencies and the currency move has had quite
an effect on  oil prices .”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May slid to 18.38 percent. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index of 24 commodities index added 0.1 percent.  Goldman Recommendation  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  reiterated yesterday its
recommendation to take advantage of an anticipated narrowing in
the Brent-WTI spread by buying the June WTI contract and selling
the same-month Brent futures. The spread will average around
$7.50 in the second quarter, Goldman analysts including  Jeffrey
Currie  said. It was $15.52 today.  Brent, the benchmark for half the world’s oil, is more
sensitive to changes in Middle Eastern and North African
production because Europe has a greater dependence on supplies
from the region.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped
30.31 million barrels a day last month, according to OPEC’s
monthly oil market report. That’s up from 30.24 million in
January and is the most since November, according to OPEC
estimates based on secondary sources. U.S. supplies will rise to
the most in almost three decades in 2013, OPEC estimated.  Awaiting Inventory  The EIA may say tomorrow that oil stockpiles rose to an
eight-month high last week and diesel and gasoline supplies
fell, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Crude inventories probably grew by 2.3 million
barrels to 383.7 million in the week ended March 8, the most
since June 22. That would be an eighth gain, the longest streak
of advances since May.  “OPEC produced more oil in February, but really we are
waiting for the U.S. inventory numbers,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“Oil is moving along with the dollar.”  The EIA reduced its crude-oil price and global consumption
projections for 2013 in the monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook.
WTI will average  $91.92 a barrel  this year, down 1 percent from
the February projection of $92.81. The U.S. benchmark grade will
average $92.17 in 2014, unchanged from the previous month’s
estimate.  The department  decreased its forecast  for global oil
consumption this year to 90.13 million barrels a day from 90.21
million estimated last month.  Seaway Pipeline  Supplies increased to 381.4 million barrels in the week
ended March 1 as inventories rose at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for New York futures, the EIA reported last week.  A doubling of the capacity on the Seaway pipeline to the
Gulf Coast from Cushing is expected to help clear a glut. The
boost to 850,000 barrels a day will be completed in the first
quarter, according to slides published by  Enterprise Products
Partners LP (EPD) , co-owner of Seaway, at a Feb. 28 Simmons Energy
Conference presentation. Seaway was reversed in May to provide
an outlet for growing production from  North Dakota  and western
 Canada .  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 651,865
contracts as of 4:41 p.m. It totaled 429,602 contracts
yesterday, 20 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was a record 1.726 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
