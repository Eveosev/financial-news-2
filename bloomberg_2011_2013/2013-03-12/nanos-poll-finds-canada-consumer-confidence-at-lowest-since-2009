Canadian  consumer confidence  fell
to its lowest since 2009, as expectations for growth turned
negative and the outlook for jobs worsened, according to a poll
released by Nanos Research.  The Nanos Economic Mood Index -- an aggregate of survey
responses on the outlook for the economy, job security, personal
finances and real estate -- fell to 99 in February from 103.8 a
month earlier.  Statistics  Canada  reported earlier this month that  growth 
in the worldâ€™s 11th largest economy slowed to a 0.6 percent
annualized pace in the fourth quarter last year, making the
second half of 2012 the weakest since Canada emerged from its
last recession.  All measures calculated by Nanos deteriorated during the
month. The balance of opinion between those who say their jobs
are secure and those who believe they are not fell to 29.4
percentage points, from 34.3 in January.  Net perceptions on personal finances fell to negative 15.3
from negative 10.5 in January, while the balance of opinion
indicator that gauges optimism about future growth swung to
negative 4.9 percentage points, from 4.8 percentage points a
month earlier. The measure calculating optimism about real
estate values fell to 16.1 in February from 16.7 in the prior
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
