Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) , the largest
U.S. warehouse-club chain, said second-quarter profit rose 39
percent, helped by a tax benefit on a dividend paid to an
employee retirement-savings program.  Net income  in the quarter ended Feb. 17 rose to $547
million, or $1.24 a share, from $394 million, or 90 cents, a
year earlier, the Issaquah, Washington-based company said today
in a statement. Excluding a gain of $62 million from a tax
benefit in connection with a dividend paid to a 401(k) savings
plan, profit was $1.10 a share. Analysts  projected  $1.06, the
average of 24 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Costco has worked to lower its already-discounted prices to
lure more shoppers to its annual memberships. The strategy has
worked, helping boost second-quarter sales at stores open for
more than a year 5 percent, excluding changes in gas prices and
foreign-currency exchange rates. Revenue by similar measures
gained 1.2 percent at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in the U.S. and 0.4
percent at  Target Corp. (TGT)  in their most recent quarters.  Costco  rose  1.3 percent to $103.75 at the close in New
York. The shares have added 5.1 percent this year, compared with
an 8.9 percent gain for the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index.  Revenue from membership fees advanced 15 percent to $528
million, the company said. That was part of an 8.3 percent
increase in total revenue to $24.9 billion, Costco said. That
missed the $24.95 billion average estimate of 17 analysts.  About half of the gain in membership revenue came from fee
increases, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a
call with analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
