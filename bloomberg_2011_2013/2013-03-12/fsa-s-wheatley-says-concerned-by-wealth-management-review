The U.K. finance regulator’s recent
review of sales practices at six retail banks’ wealth-management
divisions is “worrying,” said Martin Wheatley, a managing
director at the agency.  The Financial Services Authority has “concerns both over
the suitability of investment portfolios, as well as banks’
ability to demonstrate suitability, in a significant number of
customer files,” Wheatley said in prepared remarks for a London
speech. “We are even more worried that the firms’ own
compliance departments identified a much smaller number.”  The FSA will be replaced on April 1 by the Financial
Conduct Authority, which will have an increased focus on
protecting British consumers, and the Prudential Regulation
Authority, which will become a unit of the  Bank of England ,
keeping watch on systemic financial issues.  Wheatley, who will lead the FCA, said he will set up a
wealth-management supervision department to increase oversight.  The FSA said in August that its push to ensure wealth-
management services were responsibly sold to retail clients has
resulted in enforcement probes. The regulator had said it became
concerned with the “unacceptable risk” for clients and wrote
letters in 2011 to chief executive officers at firms that
provide retail wealth-management advice after identifying
“widespread failings” in the sector.  The agency is also taking on regulation of  consumer credit ,
increasing its focus on corporate governance structures, and
strengthening client-asset rules, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
