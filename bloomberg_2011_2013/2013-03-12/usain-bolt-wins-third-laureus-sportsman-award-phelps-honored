Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt
was named sportsman of the year at the 2013 Laureus World Sports
Awards ceremony in Rio de Janeiro. Gold-medal winning
heptathlete Jessica Ennis of Britain took the women’s award.  Bolt, a 26-year-old Jamaican, claimed the award for the
third time after repeating his feat at the 2008 Beijing Olympics
by winning gold medals in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 400-
meter relay in London last year. Ennis, 27, won the Olympic
heptathlon with a British-record score of 6,955 points.  Tennis player  Andy Murray , who secured the men’s gold medal
at the London games, won the Laureus breakthrough award after
also taking his first Grand Slam singles title at the U.S. Open.
Europe’s Ryder Cup golf squad took the team award after matching
the biggest comeback in the history of the biennial competition
against the U.S. to retain the title.  U.S. swimmer  Michael Phelps  received the inaugural
exceptional achievement award after lifting his career tally to
a record 22 Olympic medals, including an all-time best 18 golds.  The winners were chosen from a shortlist by the Laureus
World Sports Academy, a panel made up of 46 leading sportsmen
and sportswomen including  Dan Marino ,  Franz Beckenbauer ,  Jack Nicklaus  and  Martina Navratilova .  To contact the reporter on this story:
