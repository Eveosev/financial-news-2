Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  Chief
Financial Officer  Charles Holley  said sales returned to normal
by the end of February after being hurt by delayed tax returns
the previous month.  The slowing in sales in January wasn’t “disastrous,”
Holley said today at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2013
Consumer & Retail Conference in New York.  Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, had struggled early
this year as the late release of tax forms and additional,
federally mandated fraud scrutiny delayed some returns while a
rise in the payroll tax took a bigger bite from shoppers’
paychecks. Jerry Murray, Wal-Mart’s vice president of finance
and logistics, said in a Feb. 12 e-mail obtained by Bloomberg
News that month-to-date sales had been a “total disaster.”  Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, rose 0.9 percent
to $73.60 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 7.9
percent this year, compared with a 10 percent gain for the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average .  To contact the reporter on this story:
