Barwa Real Estate Co. (BRES)  tumbled the
most in more than three years after the Gulf Cooperation
Council’s largest real estate developer by assets recommended
the same  cash dividend as last year .  The shares dropped 7.7 percent, the most since December
2009, to 24.91 riyals at the close in Doha. Barwa shares were
 the most traded  on the benchmark  QE Index (DSM) , which fell 0.4
percent.  The board recommended a 1 riyal cash dividend per share for
2012 after profit declined 17 percent to 1.17 billion riyals
($321 million). Revenue from leasing rose 18 percent to 741
million riyals.  Trading in Barwa shares is “dominated by domestic
investors, predominantly retail, who react more to dividends
than earnings,” said  Julian Bruce , Dubai-based head of
institutional trading at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE. A “dividend of
1 riyal was disappointing versus expectations of 1.5 riyals
hence the sell-off.”  Profit for 2013 may climb 13 percent to 1.32 billion
riyals, according to Aljazira Capital Co. Barwa’s  14-day
relative strength index  declined to 22 today. A reading below 30
indicates for some analysts that the security is poised to gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
