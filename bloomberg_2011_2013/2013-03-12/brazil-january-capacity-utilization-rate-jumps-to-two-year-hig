Brazil ’s industrial capacity
 utilization  rose more than expected in January to the most in
two years as manufacturers show signs of emerging from a slump.  Capacity usage as measured by the National Industrial
Confederation, known as CNI, reached 84 percent in the month, as
compared to a 81 percent  forecast  from nine economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. Utilization increased from a revised 82.9 percent
in December and 81.4 percent last year.  President  Dilma Rousseff  has enacted tax breaks for
industrial goods and pressured commercial banks to reduce
lending rates to revive investment in  Latin America ’s biggest
economy, which last year posted the slowest growth among the
BRIC countries of Russia, India and  China . The government also
cut industrial power rates as much as 32 percent to boost
competitiveness. The central bank on March 6 held its benchmark
 rate  at a record low 7.25 percent for a third straight meeting.  “Industry has reduced its idleness,” Flavio Castelo Branco, CNI’s executive manager of economic policy, said in an
interview. CNI expanded the number of industries included in the
index’s calculation to 21 from 19 previously, he said.  Industrial  production  rose 2.5 percent in January, more
than the 1.6 percent forecast from economists and the highest
monthly increase since March 2010, the national statistics
institute said March 7. Output of capital goods, a sign of
investment, rose 17.3 percent from a year earlier, the first
increase after 16 months of decline.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.86 percent at
1:15 p.m. local time. The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.9615
per  U.S. dollar  from 1.9569 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
