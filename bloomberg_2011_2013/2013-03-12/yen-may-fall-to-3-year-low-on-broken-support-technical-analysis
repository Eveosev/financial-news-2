The yen may decline to its weakest
level in more than three years after weakening past a key
support target, according to IronFX Financial Services Ltd.  The Japanese currency might fall to 97.60, its lowest level
since August 2009, in the next three to six days after
decreasing past support at 96.55 yesterday, according to
Marshall Gittler, head of global foreign-exchange strategy at
Limassol, Cyprus-based IronFX. The decline is being driven by
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s continued efforts to boost
inflation, said Gittler, a former yen strategist at Deutsche
Bank AG in  Tokyo .  “There are a lot of structural impediments to growth in
 Japan , and it’s very difficult to overcome these,” Gittler said
in a telephone interview. “The one thing that they can do is
loosen monetary policy further. They can do that quickly, and it
may have some effect.”  The yen increased 0.4 percent to 95.87 per dollar today in
 New York  after falling to 0.5 percent to 96.71. The currency may
experience trend-line resistance at about 95.70, Gittler said.
The yen appreciated to as much as 95.64 earlier before paring
its gain.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
sell orders may be gathered, and support is an area where there
may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
