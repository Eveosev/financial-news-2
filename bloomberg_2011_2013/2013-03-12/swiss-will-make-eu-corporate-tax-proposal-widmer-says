Switzerland will make proposals by
the middle of this year on how to solve a disagreement with the
European Union over tax rates paid by multinational
corporations, according to Finance Minister Eveline Widmer- Schlumpf.  Tax rates vary among Switzerland’s 26 cantons, and they may
charge companies less tax on income earned abroad than on that
earned in Switzerland. The practice, termed “ring-fencing,”
has helped Switzerland to attract big companies such as  Glencore
International Plc. (GLEN)  EU officials say that this system gives
foreign firms an unfair advantage.  “By the middle of the year, the middle of the Irish EU
presidency, we’ll have to make proposals,” Widmer-Schlumpf said
in a speech to members of a economics society in Bern late
yesterday.  EU countries have threatened countermeasures if Switzerland
doesn’t act by then.  “We’ll without a doubt stick to our sovereignty and our
inter-cantonal tax competition,” she said. “We will construct
the tax system in a way in that it’s accepted and at a same time
in a way that we assure income.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
