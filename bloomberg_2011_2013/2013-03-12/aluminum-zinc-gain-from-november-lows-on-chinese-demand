Copper fell in  London  after higher
production of the metal in China and expanding stockpiles
indicated supply is ample.  Copper production in China increased 12 percent in the
year’s first two months, according to the nation’s statistics
bureau. Inventories tracked by the London Metal Exchange are the
highest since 2010 and swelled today for a 19th session.  “The February copper output data was positive, which has a
detrimental effect on prices,” Steve Hardcastle, head of client
services for industrial commodities at Sucden Financial Ltd. in
London, said by phone. “The longs to an extent are out,” he
said, referring to bets on higher prices.  Copper for delivery in three months dropped 0.3 percent to
$7,735 a metric ton by 10:34 a.m. on the LME. Prices will stay
“range-bound for now above $7,700,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London, said by e-mail. Copper for
delivery in May fell 0.3 percent to $3.506 a pound on the Comex
in New York.  Stockpiles of the metal, up 62 percent this year to the
highest since March 2010, rose 0.8 percent to 517,900 tons,
daily LME figures showed. Orders to withdraw copper from
warehouses jumped 40 percent to 33,400 tons, cutting this year’s
drop to 35 percent, on a 10,000-ton request in New Orleans.  “There continues to be a tight market, with relatively low
levels of visible stocks,”  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , which has four
Chilean copper mines, said today as it reported annual earnings.
The company predicted stronger demand growth in  China  and the
U.S., the world’s two biggest consumers of the metal.  The dollar traded near the highest level since August
against a basket of six currencies. A stronger greenback makes
commodities less appealing as an alternative investment.  Zinc for delivery in three months on the LME rose 0.3
percent to $1,966 a ton after closing yesterday at the lowest
level since November. The 14-day relative strength index, a
gauge of whether a commodity is overbought or oversold, is below
the level of 30 that indicates a potential impending rebound to
some analysts who study technical charts.  Nickel, tin and aluminum fell in London. Lead rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
