Merck & Co. (MRK)  jumped the most since
July after saying it will continue a closely-watched study of
its cholesterol lowering drug Vytorin, easing investor concern
that the drug may pose a risk to patients.  Merck rose 3.2 percent to $45.04 at 4 p.m.  New York  time
for its biggest gain since July 27. The research, called
IMPROVE-IT, is projected to continue until September 2014, the
 Whitehouse Station , New Jersey-based company said in a statement
today.  Vytorin, with $1.7 billion in sales last year, combines the
generic cholesterol drug simvastatin with Merck’s cholesterol
drug Zetia, which generated $2.6 billion in revenue. Investors
have been awaiting results of the study after researchers found
in 2008 that Vytorin may not provide heart benefits over
simvastatin, which is sold for a fraction of the price. That
finding slashed sales of Vytorin and Zetia as doctors started
prescribing lower-cost generic cholesterol medicines instead.  The announcement “suggests no safety issues,” said  Mark Schoenebaum , an analyst with ISI Group in New York, in a note to
clients. “If Zetia, Vytorin were unsafe, would you be
comfortable waiting another 18 months to look at the data?”  Merck hasn’t seen trial results and no more reviews are
planned, the drugmaker said. Under the current time frame,
results won’t be available until about two years before Zetia’s
patent expires, limiting the amount of sales Merck stands to
lose if the final outcome is negative, Schoenebaum said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
