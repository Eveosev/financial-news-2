The U.K. stocks climbed for a
fourth day, extending the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index’s (UKX)  highest
level in more than five years.  Antofagasta (ANTO)  Plc rallied 3.1 percent after the copper
producer doubled its dividend payout.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) 
gained 1.2 percent after the lender sold a 520 million-pound
($773 million) stake in  St. James’s Place (STJ)  Plc. British Land Co.
dropped the most in 1 1/2 years after the company sold new
shares equivalent to about 10 percent of pre-offer capital.  The FTSE 100 rose 6.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,510.62
at the close in London, extending its highest level since
December 2007. The equity benchmark has climbed 1.3 percent in
four days as economic reports from U.S. payrolls to Chinese
exports bolstered optimism in the global recovery.  “The market has actually moved to another stage,” Justin Urquhart Stewart, who helps oversee about $6.8 billion at Seven
Investment Management Ltd., said in a telephone interview from
London. “The global economy is healing itself quite well,
corporate results are pretty good and there is even a hint of
some M&A. There is every reason to still be in this market.”  The broader FTSE All-Share Index added 0.1 percent while
Ireland’s  ISEQ Index (ISEQ)  advanced 0.6 percent. The volume of shares
changing hands in companies on the FTSE 100 was 8.6 percent
lower than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Industrial Output  Gains were limited after data showed an unexpected drop in
U.K.  industrial production  and manufacturing in January.
Production and factory output fell 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent
respectively, the Office for National Statistics said.  Antofagasta advanced 3.1 percent to 1,129 pence after the
copper producer doubled its dividend to 98.5 cents a share,
including a 77.5-cent special payment. The company still
reported a 17 percent decline in 2012 net income to $1.03
billion that fell short of analysts’ average estimate.  Fellow copper producer,  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  jumped 6.1 percent to
552 pence for the biggest advance on the FTSE 100. The stock had
tumbled 9.1 percent from the previous four days.  Lloyds gain 1.2 percent to 50.6 pence after the mortgage
lender sold part of its stake in St. James’s Place as the
industry faces pressure from regulators to bolster capital.  Bank of America Corp. sold the 102 million shares on behalf
of Lloyds at 510 pence apiece. The U.K. bank still owns 37
percent of the money manager, which declined 4.9 percent to
510.5 pence today.  IAG Jobs  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  gained 4.8
percent to 257.2 pence after the parent of British Airways
resolved a dispute with unions in Spain.  IAG yesterday backed a mediator’s plan for about 3,140 job
cuts at unprofitable Spanish unit Iberia after offering
concessions that won union backing. IAG Chief Executive Officer
Willie Walsh is seeking a 600 million-euro ($780 million)
earnings turnaround at Iberia by 2015.  InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG)  increased 1.8 percent to
2,011 pence, its highest price since its spinoff from Six
Continents Plc and initial public offering in 2003. UBS AG today
raised its recommendation for the company to neutral from sell.
Volume matched the three-month average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  British Land dropped 4.4 percent to 555 pence after the
U.K.’s second-largest real estate investment trust raised about
493 million pounds in a share sale to help fund acquisitions and
development.  Morgan Stanley, UBS AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. placed
the 89.7 million new shares, on behalf of the company, at 550
pence apiece which was at the lower end of a price guidance
given to investors.  Elsewhere, IG Group Holdings Plc rallied 7.6 percent to
561.5 pence on the broader All-Share Index. A close at this
price would be the highest for the stock since the company sold
shares to the public in April 2005. The spread-betting firm
posted an 18 percent increase in third-quarter revenue to 88.6
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
