Symrise AG (SY1) , the world’s fourth-
largest flavors and fragrance supplier, fell the most in six
months in Frankfurt trading as investors focused on margins that
were shy of analysts’ estimates rather than long-term growth
targets.  Profitability at the maker of perfume ingredients for
Dior’s Fahrenheit narrowed by 50 basis points to 19.5 percent
last year, the company said in a release today. DZ Bank analyst
Thomas Maul had predicted 19.9 percent. The stock fell as much
as 4.2 percent to 28.36 euros, its biggest intraday slide since
Sept. 12.  Symrise forecast that the inflated raw-material prices that
crimped margins in 2012 will remain at a high level and Chief
Executive Officer Heinz-Juergen Bertram pledged to improve
efficiency and expand in  emerging markets  to lift earnings to
more than 500 million euros ($650 million) by 2020, with sales
of 1 billion euros.  "All in all good prospects for Symrise have not changed at
all, however, weaker than expected 2012 margin and change of
guidance may cause some pressure on the shares in the first
hours of trading,’’ said Maul in a note.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization gained 7 percent to 339 million euros last year, in
line with analysts’ estimates, Symrise said in a release today.
Bertram said the company’s “well equipped” for 2013, and that
the company’s growth should outpace expansion in the wider
fragrances and flavors market.  The stock was down 4 percent at 28.40 euros as of 9:46 a.m.
local time, valuing the company at 3.4 billion euros. Prior to
today, the stock had risen 9.1 percent this year, less than the
12 percent gain of  Germany ’s MDAX index of mid-sized companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
