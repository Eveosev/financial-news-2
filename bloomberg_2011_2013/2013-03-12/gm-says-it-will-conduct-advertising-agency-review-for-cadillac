General Motors Co. (GM)  said it will
conduct an advertising agency review for its Cadillac luxury
brand.  Fallon Worldwide has the Cadillac account and will be
invited to participate in the review “with other agencies,”
Detroit-based GM said in a statement on its website.  The company said it’s not disclosing other agencies
involved in the review or how it will be conducted.  Cadillac’s U.S. vehicle sales in the first two months of
the year rose 32 percent to 26,961, according to researcher
Autodata Corp. GM is emphasizing Cadillac and mass-market
 Chevrolet  as its primary brands worldwide.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
