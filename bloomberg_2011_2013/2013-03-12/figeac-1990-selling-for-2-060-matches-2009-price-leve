A 1990 case of Chateau Figeac
Saint-Emilion fetched 1,380 pounds ($2,060) on the London-based
Liv-ex market yesterday, the same price as reached in a similar
transaction back in September 2009, according to Liv-ex data on
its Cellar Watch website.  The price for top Bordeaux wines climbed in 2010 and early
2011 before dropping back over the following 16 months, as the
market reflected the broader global financial crisis. A case of
Figeac sold for as much as $4,200 at Christie’s in  New York  in
October 2009, and for just 1,265 euros ($1,580) at a Christie’s
Paris sale last June, according to the auction house’s archives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
