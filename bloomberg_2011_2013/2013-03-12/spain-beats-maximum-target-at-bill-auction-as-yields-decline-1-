Spain’s borrowing costs dropped at
a bill auction as investors bet the European Central Bank will
put a lid on market volatility triggered by a political
stalemate in  Italy .  The Treasury sold 5.83 billion euros ($7.6 billion) of six-
and 12-month securities, beating its upper goal of 5.5 billion
euros for the sale, the Madrid-based Bank of Spain said. It sold
six-month bills at an average 0.794 percent, down from 0.859
percent on Feb. 12. The 12-month securities yielded 1.363
percent, down from 1.548 percent.  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  last week fell
to the lowest since November 2010 after it sold five-year and
10-year debt at the cheapest yields in more than two years.
Meanwhile, ECB President Mario Draghi rejected concerns a
political impasse following an inconclusive vote in Italy may
threaten the euro area’s recovery path.  Demand for the six-month bills rose to 3.22 times the
amount sold, compared with 2.88 last month. The ratio was 1.85
on the longer-dated securities, down from 1.97, the Bank of
Spain said.  The yield on Spanish  10-year benchmark bonds  fell 5 basis
points to the lowest in more than two years after the auction at
11 a.m. in  Madrid . That compares with a euro-era high of 7.75
percent in July before the ECB stepped in. The spread with
similar German maturities narrowed to 322 basis points.  The Treasury returns to the markets next week to sell
three-month and nine-month bills on March 19 and bonds on March
21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
