Canadian heavy oil weakened on the
 spot market  after strengthening more than $10 a barrel in the
previous six days on a report that was seen as favorable for the
development of the Keystone XL pipeline.  Western Canada Select, a heavy blend of diluted oil-sands
bitumen, weakened by $1 a barrel to $20.50 a barrel below West
Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in April, according to
Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc. In a draft environmental
assessment March 1, the U.S. State Department said  TransCanada
Corp. (TRP) ’s planned pipeline, which would carry Canadian crude to
the U.S., wouldn’t worsen the risk of global warming.  “I think it was a little bit of an exaggerated price move,
and I think what we’re seeing right now is a little bit of
pullback on that,” said David Bouckhout, senior commodity
strategist at TD Securities in Calgary. He said fundamentals
including pipeline constraints and continued work at  BP Plc’s (BP) 
Whiting, Indiana, refinery, also weakened WCS.  Syncrude, a light oil processed from bitumen, strengthened
by $1.15 a barrel to a $7.15 premium to WTI, Net Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
