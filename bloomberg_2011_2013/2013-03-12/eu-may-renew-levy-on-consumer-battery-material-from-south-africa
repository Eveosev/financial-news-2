The European Union threatened to
renew for another five years a tariff against South Africa on a
material for consumer batteries, saying EU producers including
Greece’s Tosoh Hellas AIC may need the longer trade protection.  The 27-nation EU said it would examine whether to reimpose
the 17.1 percent levy on imports of electrolytic manganese
dioxide from South Africa. The bloc imposed the levy in 2008 to
punish Delta EMD Pty for selling the material in Europe below
cost, a practice known as dumping.  The review “will determine whether the expiry of the
measures would be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence
of dumping” and “a continuation or recurrence of injury” to
the EU industry, the European Commission, the bloc’s trade
authority in Brussels, said today in the  Official Journal . The
anti-dumping duty was due to lapse this week and will now stay
in place during the probe, which can last as long as 15 months.  Delta EMD , which in 2008 was South Africa’s only known
producer of electrolytic manganese dioxide, increased its share
of the EU market to between 60 percent and 70 percent in the 12
months through September 2006 from 30 percent to 40 percent in
2002, the bloc said at the time.  The probe into whether to renew the duty results from a
Dec. 11 request by Tosoh Hellas and Spain’s  Cegasa Internacional
SA , the only EU producers of electrolytic manganese dioxide, the
commission said today. A regular re-imposition of the levy would
be for five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
