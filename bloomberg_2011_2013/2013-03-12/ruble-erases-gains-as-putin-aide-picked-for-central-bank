The ruble erased its advance versus
the dollar and pared gains against the central bank’s currency
basket after President  Vladimir Putin  nominated a Kremlin aide
and former economy minister to lead the regulator.  The Russian currency was little changed at 30.7090 per
dollar by 8:33 p.m. in Moscow, after earlier strengthening as
much as 0.3 percent to 30.6330. It was less than 0.1 percent
stronger at 34.8861 against the  dollar-euro basket  used to
manage the ruble, from 34.8614 earlier in the day.  Elvira Nabiullina, an adviser to the president and  Russia ’s
economy minister from 2007 to 2012, was nominated by Putin to
succeed Bank Rossii Chairman Sergey Ignatiev when his third term
ends in June. Putin said her nomination will be submitted to
lawmakers. Ignatiev has resisted calls to cut  interest rates ,
sparking what Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Shuvalov  called a
“huge argument” with the government on how to stoke flagging
economic growth.  “The market is disappointed,” Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief
economist at Otkritie Financial Corp. in Moscow, said by phone
after the announcement. “Even though Nabiullina is a quite good
economist there are some concerns that her politics, if she is
approved to the post, would be in favor of the Kremlin.”  Yields on Russia’s ruble-denominated Eurobond rose 4 basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.07 percent. The central
bank uses the dollar-euro basket to limit swings in the ruble
that erode exporter’s competitiveness.  Futures expiring in March on the ruble signaled 0.1 percent
weakness to 30.736 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
