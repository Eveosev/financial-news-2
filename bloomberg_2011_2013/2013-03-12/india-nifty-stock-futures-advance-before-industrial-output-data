Indian (SENSEX)  stocks declined the most in
two weeks amid concern a faster-than-estimated expansion in
factory output may reduce the scope for monetary easing.  The S&P BSE Sensex lost 0.6 percent to 19,535.68, according
to preliminary closing prices in Mumbai. Volumes were 20 percent
below the 30-day average.  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) ,  India ’s biggest
generator outside state control, slid 3 percent after it was
downgraded by Credit Suisse Group AG. Lender  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) 
retreated 1.9 percent.  Industrial  production  in January climbed 2.4 percent from a
year ago after a revised 0.5 percent drop in December, data from
the government showed today. The median of 28 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey was for a 1.3 percent gain. Inflation data for
February are due on March 14 and the  Reserve Bank  of India meets
for its next policy review on March 19.  “It looks like hopes for a 50-basis point cut next week
have been tempered, and at best, we will only have a 25-basis
point reduction,” Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP
Paribas Financial Services Ltd., said by phone from Kochi in
southern India today. “Some investors would also like to take a
hard look at the inflation number before buying.”  The  Reserve Bank of India  meets for its next policy review
on March 19. The authority cut its benchmark  rate  by 25 basis
points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29, the first reduction in nine
months. That’s still the highest among major Asian nations.  Tata Power slid 3.1 percent to 98 rupees. HDFC Bank lost
1.9 percent to 643 rupees.  Foreigners bought a net $251 million worth of local shares
on March 8, taking their net investment in Indian equities this
year to $9 billion, a record for the period, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. They bought a net $24.5 billion worth of shares
last year, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
