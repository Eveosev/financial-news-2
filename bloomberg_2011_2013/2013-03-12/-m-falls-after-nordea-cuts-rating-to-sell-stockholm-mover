Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , Europe’s
second-largest clothing retailer, fell the most in two weeks in
Stockholm trading after Nordea Bank AB cut its rating on the
company to sell from buy and reduced its price estimate.  The shares declined as much as 2 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Feb. 26. The stock slipped 1.3 percent to
234.40 kronor as of 11:05 a.m. local time, giving the Stockholm-
based company a market value of 393 billion kronor ($61.4
billion.)  H&M shares have gained 10 percent since Nordea upgraded the
shares to buy in November and with limited scope for earnings
growth in the first half of this year, the bank sees a lack of
near-terms triggers, analysts Stefan Stjernholm and Stellan Hellstrom said in a note to clients. The “long-term story is
intact” and tough market conditions in  Europe  and limited
online exposure will probably hamper sales, they said.  “H&M’s limited exposure to online is likely to hold back
sales momentum until the company can offer online sales in all
its market, which we do not expect until 2015,” they said.  Nordea lowered its price estimate on the stock to 220
kronor from 260 kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
