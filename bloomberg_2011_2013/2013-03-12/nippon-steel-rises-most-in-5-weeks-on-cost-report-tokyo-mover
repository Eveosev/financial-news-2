Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal
Industry Corp.,  Japan ’s top steelmaker, rose the most in five
weeks after the Nikkei newspaper said it will likely close a
blast furnace near Tokyo to cut idled capacity.  The  shares  rose as much as 7.2 percent to 268 yen, headed
for their biggest gain since Feb. 4. They were up 6 percent at
265 yen as of 10:34 a.m. in Tokyo trading.  The reported closure is the first measure to streamline
operations at the company following its creation in October from
the combination of Nippon Steel Corp. and Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd. The measure will be part of a mid-term business
plan to be announced this week, the Nikkei reported earlier
today without saying where it got the information.  The company in November raised its cost-saving targets by
33 percent to 200 billion yen ($2.1 billion) annually after
three years of integration.  Nothing has been decided about any closures, Nippon Steel &
Sumitomo Metal said today in a statement.  The steelmaker plans to close one of three blast furnaces
at its Chiba mill, the company’s biggest plant, within several
years, Nikkei reported. The furnace is equivalent to about 7
percent of the company’s production capacity, Nikkei said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
