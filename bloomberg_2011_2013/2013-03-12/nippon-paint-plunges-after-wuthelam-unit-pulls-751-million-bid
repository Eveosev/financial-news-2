Nippon Paint Co. (4912)  dropped by the
most in two years in  Tokyo  trading after saying a Wuthelam Group
unit withdrew a takeover bid valued at $751 million.  Wuthelemâ€™s Nipsea International Ltd. unit has abandoned the
unsolicited 900 yen a share offer and will begin new talks with
Nippon Paint on possible ventures in Asia, the Osaka-based
paintmaker said today in a statement. Nippon Paint  fell  5.7
percent, the biggest decline since March 14, 2011, to 852 yen at
the close of trading in Tokyo.  Nipsea in January offered to pay 72 billion yen ($751
million) for a 30 percent stake in the paintmaker, which already
counted Singapore-based Wuthelam as its largest shareholder with
a 14.5 percent stake. Acquisitions of stakes in Japanese
companies announced by overseas firms jumped to $13.9 billion
last year, a 37 percent increase since 2011 and the most since
2008 according to data compiled Bloomberg.  Wuthelam formed the Nipsea venture with Nippon Paint more
than 50 years ago and the two companies operate ventures in
countries including China, Singapore and Malaysia.  Kyodo News  reported the bid withdrawal earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
