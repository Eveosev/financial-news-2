EFG Financial Products Holding AG (FPHN) 
rose the most in almost five months after Notenstein Private
Bank agreed to buy a 20 percent stake in the Swiss firm from  EFG
International AG. (EFGN)   EFG Financial Products climbed as much as 6.1 percent, the
biggest gain since the company sold shares in an initial public
offering in October. The stock was 5.3 percent higher at 51.9
francs as of 10:16 a.m. in Zurich trading, valuing the company
at 346 million francs ($365 million).  Notenstein, which is owned by St. Gallen-based Raiffeisen
Schweiz, agreed to buy the stake for 70.2 million francs,
according to an  e-mailed statement  from EFG International today.
EFG International, which created the investment products
business in 2007, reduced its shareholding from 58 percent to
about 25 percent at the time of the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
