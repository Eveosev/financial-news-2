France ’s benchmark  CAC 40 Index (CAC) 
will cross the 4,000 mark for the first time since July 2011,
and will rally further if it crosses a key resistance level,
according to a technical analyst at Louis Capital Markets LLP.  The gauge had in December crossed above a long-term
downtrend formed by the successively lower highs of 2011 and
2012 and started a firm medium-term uptrend, Andy Dodd wrote in
e-mailed comments. The CAC 40 won’t face resistance until it
reaches 4,024, he added.  “I would expect some resistance at those levels, but the
uptrend is clearly in place at the moment,” London-based Dodd
said. “There is not much in the way of resistance until the
4,024 swing high and I am happy to be long here and buy
pullbacks to the uptrend.”  The  measure of French equities  will come under pressure
between 4,024 and 4,088, which are intraday highs reached in
July 2011 and January 2010 respectively, Dodd said. A break
above this zone will yield more gains and the CAC 40 will rally
to as high as 4,170, about the highest level in 2011.  The  index , which includes Sanofi, Total SA and BNP Paribas
SA, added 0.1 percent to 3,840.61 at 1:59 p.m. in Paris. The
measure has risen 5.5 percent so far this year as U.S. lawmakers
reached a budget compromise and investors bet that central banks
around the world would continue with policies to support
economic recovery.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of price, volume and other trading data to predict changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
