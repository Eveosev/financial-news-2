Prospects that  Yandex NV (YNDX)  will use
part of its almost $1 billion in cash for dividends outweigh a
share sale that sent the Russian company’s stock down the most
in three weeks, Barclays Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co say.  The nation’s most-used search engine tumbled 8 percent to
$23.03 yesterday after some of its largest shareholders said
they would sell twice as much stock as the company had planned
to acquire in a buyback announced March 11. Yandex raised $552
million in the offering, pricing shares at $22.75 apiece,
according to a statement released after trading closed in New
York. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. and RTS Index  futures  retreated.  At least seven of the 16 analysts that have buy
recommendations on Yandex reiterated their ratings on the
Nasdaq-listed company yesterday. Boris Vilidnitsky, an analyst
at Barclays in  London  who sees Yandex gaining 54 percent in the
next 12 months, said yesterday’s slide was “overdone” as the
company, which had $895 million in cash and cash equivalents as
of Dec. 31, may use part of these funds to reward shareholders.  “This is just the beginning,” Vilidnitsky said by phone
yesterday. “The company has a lot of cash and has been
discussing using some of it as a dividend payment, which I think
may happen already this year. I would be a buyer here.”  The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge lost 1.3 percent to 100.69 as
RTS stock futures slipped 0.5 percent to 153,220 in U.S. hours.  Cash Pile  Besides Vilidnitsky,  analysts  at JPMorgan, Credit Suisse
Group AG, UralSib Financial Corp., Otkritie Capital and Sberbank
Investment Research reiterated their buy ratings on Yandex
yesterday. Of the 21 analysts covering the stock, 76 percent have
a buy recommendation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reiterated its 12-month target
price on Yandex at $31.50 yesterday, implying a 37 percent
gain from current levels.  Yandex, which has never paid dividends, had $900 million
in cash as of last month and expected to have “about $1 billion in
the near future,” Chief Financial Officer Alexander Shulgin
said on a Feb. 19 conference call.  The company’s  founders -- Chief Executive Officer Arkady Volozh and Chief Technology Officer Ilya Segalovich -- along with
shareholders including  Baring Vostok Capital Partners  sold 24.3
million shares. Volozh is expected to reduce his stake to 10.5
percent from the current 12.2 percent, Segalovich's will drop to 
2.5 percent from 2.6 percent, while Baring Vostok will cut to 
11 percent from the current 16 percent, according to
Barclays’ Vilidnitsky.  ‘Shareholder Remuneration’  “We remain positive on Yandex long-term fundamentals and
would view any weakness in the shares as a buying opportunity,”
JPMorgan analysts wrote in a report yesterday. “The decision to 
use Yandex’s existing cash cushion suggests that more shareholder
remuneration may follow, possibly in the form of dividends.”  Yandex reported last month fourth-quarter earnings that
missed analysts' estimates, and said domestic sales growth will 
slow.  The Market Vectors  Russia  ETF, the largest Russian
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 1.2 percent to $28.92 in 
New York yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures 
expected swings in the stock futures, slipped 0.5 percent to 
20.78 points.  The ruble erased its advance versus the dollar and pared
gains against the central bank’s currency basket after President
Vladimir Putin nominated  Elvira Nabiullina , an adviser to the
president and Russia’s economy minister from 2007 to 2012, to
lead Bank Rossii.  Oil Rises  Futures expiring in March on Russia’s ruble showed the
currency falling 0.2 percent to 30.744 per dollar, after
strengthening as much as 0.3 percent to 30.6330 in Moscow
yesterday. The ruble gained less than 0.1 percent versus the
dollar to 30.7010 by the close in Moscow. The currency was
little changed at 34.8955 against the dollar-euro basket used by
the central bank to minimize swings that hurt exporters.  Crude for April delivery gained 0.5 percent to $92.54 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, narrowing
its discount to Brent crude to the least in more than
five weeks. Brent for April settlement dropped 0.6 percent to 
$109.65 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. 
 Urals crude , Russia’s major export blend, was little changed at 
$106.79.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 1.4 percent to HK$4.15 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:20
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
