  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s software will power
more tablets than  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s operating system for the first
time this year as smaller, cheaper alternatives to the iPad gain
favor with consumers, according to IDC.  Devices running Google’s Android software will climb to 49
percent of the market in 2013, while Apple’s share will slip to
46 percent, IDC said in a  statement  today. Last year, Apple
commanded 51 percent, compared with Google’s 46 percent.  Machines introduced since the iPad’s debut in 2010 --
including Google’s own Nexus tablet and products from Amazon.com
Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. -- are gaining ground with
prices starting around $200, less than half the cost of the
newest iPad model. Apple released the iPad mini in October,
charging $329 for the most affordable version, in a bid to
defend its market dominance amid mounting competition.  “One in every two tablets shipped this quarter was below 8
inches in screen size,” Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at IDC, said
in the statement. “We expect smaller tablets to continue
growing in 2013 and beyond.”  Global shipments will reach 190.9 million units this year,
IDC said, higher than its prior prediction for 172.4 million.
The tablet market will surge to 350 million units by 2017.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows 8 software will be used on 7.4
percent of tablets by 2017, up from just 1 percent last year,
IDC said. Devices with the operating system, including
Microsoft’s Surface tablet, will take a small share from both
Apple and Google.  As multi-functional tablets gain in popularity, fewer
consumers will buy dedicated e-readers from Amazon or  Barnes &
Noble Inc. (BKS)  After peaking at 26.4 million units in 2011, e-reader
shipments slipped to 18.2 million last year and will “grow only
modestly” this year and in 2014 before starting a gradual
decline by 2015, IDC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
