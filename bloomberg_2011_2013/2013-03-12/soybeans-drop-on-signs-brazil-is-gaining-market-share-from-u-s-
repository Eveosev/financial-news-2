Soybeans fell the most in more than
two weeks as the harvest accelerates in  Brazil , where a record
crop is expected. Corn and wheat rose.  Brazilian farmers collected about 48 percent of the harvest
as of March 8, up from 46 percent a year earlier, and sold 58
percent of the crop, researcher Safras & Mercado said in a
report yesterday. Brazil, expected to overtake the U.S. as the
world’s biggest exporter, may produce a record 83.5 million
metric tons of soybeans, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
March 8.  “Harvest is moving along quickly in Brazil, and soybeans
are reaching ports and getting loaded on ships, slowing demand
for U.S. supplies,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for
Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview.  Soybean futures for delivery in May dropped 0.7 percent to
close at $14.6875 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest decline since February 22.  The May contract’s premium to November futures fell 5.4
percent to $1.9825 after yesterday reaching the highest since
September as farmers increased sales of last year’s crop, Grow
said. May soybean-meal futures fell 0.4 percent to $436.20 for
2,000 pounds of the animal feed.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to $7.1425 a
bushel in Chicago, climbing for the fifth time in six sessions.  Wheat futures for May delivery added 0.5 percent to $7.035
a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporters on this story:
