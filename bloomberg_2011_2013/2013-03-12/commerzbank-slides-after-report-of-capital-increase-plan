Commerzbank AG (CBK)  fell the most in six
weeks in Frankfurt trading after Manager Magazin said  Germany ’s
second-biggest bank planned to sell shares to increase its
capital by as much as 10 percent.  Commerzbank fell as much as 5.3 percent to 1.367 euros, the
biggest decline since Feb. 4. It dropped 3.2 percent to 1.398
euros at 5:16 p.m., valuing the company at 8.2 billion euros
($10.7 billion).  The bank hired  UBS AG (UBSN)  to help prepare the possible share
sale, which could raise 700 million euros ($912 million) to 800
million euros, the magazine reported on its  website  citing
people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified.  Nils Happich, a spokesman for Commerzbank in  Frankfurt ,
declined to comment on the report when contacted by telephone. A
Frankfurt-based UBS spokeswoman declined to comment.  “Such a sale wouldn’t be good for the share price and
wouldn’t be a smart move,” Ingo Frommen, an analyst with
Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart who recommends
investors hold Commerzbank shares, said in a telephone
interview. “The stock would be sold at less than its value and
you’d have to be in an emergency to do so.”  Commerzbank’s price-to-book ratio, a measure investors use
to calculate a company’s value, is 0.37, less than half of the
average 0.82 for companies traded on the 46-member Stoxx 600
Banks Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
