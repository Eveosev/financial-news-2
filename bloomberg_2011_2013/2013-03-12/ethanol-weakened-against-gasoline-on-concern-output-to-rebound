Ethanol weakened against gasoline
on concern that improving returns for making the biofuel will
spur a rebound in production from record low levels for this
time of year.  The spread widened 0.78 cent to 61.62 cents a gallon a day
before the Energy Information Administration is to report the
most recent weekly production data. Ethanol has risen 5.4
percent this month, boosting returns to the highest level since
June and narrowing its discount to gasoline from the 2013 high
of 78.76 cents on Feb. 14, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “It’s tightened significantly,” said Jerrod Kitt, an
analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago . “I would be surprised if we
didn’t see a production increase tomorrow.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $2.534 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, dropping from the highest price since Sept. 4. Prices
have gained 16 percent this year.  Gasoline futures for April delivery slipped 0.22 cent to
$3.1502 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol Output  Ethanol  production  was down 16 percent to 805,000 barrels a
day in the week ended March 1, from a record 963,000 barrels a
day December 2011, data from the Energy Department’s analytical
arm show.  Plants reduced output and shut operations as manufacturing
costs increased with the price of corn after drought reduced
yields.  Corn for March delivery advanced 6.5 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $7.41 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. The May contract jumped by 3 cents to
$7.1425 a bushel.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
10 cents a gallon, the highest level since June 22. The amount
doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’
grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to
livestock.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, the
certificates refiners submit to the Environmental Protection
Agency to show compliance with the U.S. Renewable Fuels
Standard, dropped to 77.5 cents from $1.01 yesterday, Starfuels
Inc. said today.  Advanced RINs  They were valued at a record $1.06 on March 8, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, while the worth of  advanced RINs ,
which include biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol,
fell to 92.5 cents from a record $1.08.  “Apparently, people are trying to sell them,” said Jim Damask, a manager at Starfuels in Jupiter,  Florida . “A little
bit of selling came in and it created an avalanche.”  Ethanol  stockpiles  have dropped five consecutive weeks to
19.4 million barrels in the week ended March 1, the lowest level
since Nov. 30 and the longest set of declines since October
2010, the most recent EIA report showed.  The U.S. didn’t make any  foreign purchases  of the fuel for
the first time since Feb. 1, according to the data. That
compares to the 2012 high of 122,000 barrels a day in October.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.42 a gallon last week,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gasoline Pool  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, up from 88 percent the previous week and the
highest in five months.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell in the major U.S.
trading hubs, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 5.5 cents to $2.615; in
Chicago the additive lost 4.75 cents to $2.555; in  New York  the
biofuel decreased 0.5 cent to $2.67; and on the West Coast
ethanol lost 0.5 cent to $2.855 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf expanded to
24 cents from 19 cents yesterday and Chicago’s discount to New
York Harbor widened to 11.5 cents from 7.25 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
