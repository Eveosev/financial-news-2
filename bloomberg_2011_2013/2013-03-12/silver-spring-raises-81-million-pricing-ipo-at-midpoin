Silver Spring Networks Inc. (SSNI) , the
maker of networking equipment for smart electricity grids,
raised $81 million in its initial public offering after pricing
an increased number of shares at the midpoint of the range.  The Redwood City, California-based company sold 4.75
million shares for $17 each, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, after offering 3.71 million shares for $16 to $18
apiece. The stock will be listed on the  New York  Stock Exchange
under SSNI.  The company, which filed for a $150 million IPO last July,
planned to sell all of the shares, according to the original
terms of the  prospectus , and to raise an additional $12 million
in a private placement to its biggest shareholder, Foundation
Capital.  Revenue at the power-grid networking company declined 17
percent to $196.7 million in the 12 months through December
compared with the previous year, regulatory filings show. It
recorded a net loss of $89.7 million, narrower than the $92.4
million loss a year earlier.  The company was founded in 2002 and provides customers with
hardware and software that enable power providers to offer
flexible pricing and monitor the health of power grids,
according to company filings. Sales have been hurt by slow
adoption of smart-grid technology, caused by uncertainty over
the timing of U.S. stimulus spending and regulatory
investigations, the filings show.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG led the
IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
