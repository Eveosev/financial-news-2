Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S.
home lender, gave Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf  $1 million
in restricted share rights as part of his pay for 2012, when the
bank’s stock surged 24 percent.  Stumpf, 59, received 27,398 restricted shares, the San
Francisco-based bank said today in a regulatory filing. The
value is based on the March 8 share price of $36.50. The
restricted stock vests in three annual installments starting
March 15 next year.  Stumpf’s 2012 compensation package hasn’t been disclosed by
the bank in full. The company set his salary at $2.8 million in
2010 and hasn’t announced any change to the figure since then.
His total compensation was $19.8 million for his work in 2011.  Shares of Wells Fargo  rose last year  as residential markets
firmed and the lender originated almost 1 in 3 U.S. mortgages.
Net income of $18.9 billion set a record for a third straight
year. The shares have climbed 7.3 percent this year.  Stumpf owns about $35 million in stock based on today’s
closing price of $36.66. He holds about 956,038 shares either
directly or through family trusts and retirement accounts,
according to today’s filing.  BB&T Corp.,  North Carolina ’s second-largest bank, boosted
CEO Kelly King’s compensation 45 percent to $8.6 million for
2012. The compensation for King, 64, included almost $980,000 in
salary, plus other incentives and equity-linked rewards, the
company said today in a filing. BB&T, based in Winston-Salem,
climbed 16 percent last year, the most since 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
