European stocks  were little
changed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index closing near its
highest level in 4 1/2 years, as a report showed that U.K.
manufacturing output unexpectedly contracted.  Antofagasta (ANTO)  Plc climbed to its highest price in a month
after the copper producer more than doubled its dividend from a
year earlier. St. James’s Place Plc dropped the most in eight
months after Lloyds Banking Group Plc reduced its stake in the
wealth manager. Pirelli & C. SpA fell after forecasting earnings
for 2013 that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  The Stoxx 600 added less than 0.1 percent to 295.37 at the
close after climbing as much as 0.3 percent and dropping as much
as 0.2 percent. The gauge has  surged 5.6 percent  this year as
U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget. The equity
benchmark rose to its highest level since June 2008 last week.  “We’re getting more cautious about this top of the equity
market, and we’re beginning to think maybe you should take some
risk off the table,” said Philippe Bonnefoy, who oversees $565
million as chief investment officer at Newscape Capital Group.
He spoke in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “Analysts
have been pretty positive and aggressive on earnings and you’ve
seen earnings downgrades rather than upgrades in many cases.”  Of the 269 companies on the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  that have posted
quarterly earnings this season, 49 percent have  beaten analysts’ 
profit projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with 52 percent for the previous quarter.  Volumes Drop  National benchmark indexes advanced in 10 of the 18
western-European markets. France’s CAC 40 and the U.K.’s FTSE
100 rose 0.1 percent. Germany’s DAX fell 0.2 percent. The number
of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600-listed companies was 9.7
percent lower than the average of the past 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Stoxx 600 rallied 2.3 percent last week, its biggest
advance in two months, as a report showed the U.S. economy
created more jobs than forecast and optimism mounted that
central banks will continue to stimulate their economies.  U.K.  manufacturing output  slipped 1.5 percent in January
after increasing a revised 1.5 percent in December, according to
a statement from the Office for National Statistics. Economists
had predicted the measure would be unchanged. Total  industrial
production  in the European Union’s third-largest economy
declined 1.2 percent in January after gaining 1.1 percent in the
previous month, separate figures showed. Economists had called
for a 0.1 percent increase.  Antofagasta Gains  Antofagasta gained 3.1 percent to 1,129 pence after the
copper producer controlled by Chile’s Luksic family proposed a
dividend of 98.5 cents a share, compared with 44 cents a year
earlier. The average analyst estimate had called for a dividend
of 58 cents.  SBM Offshore NV surged 21 percent to 12.93 euros, its
biggest rally since at least October 1989, after agreeing to pay
$470 million to settle a dispute with Talisman Energy Inc. The
world’s biggest supplier of floating oil rigs said it will take
a provision of $270 million in addition to the $200 million that
it set aside in December for its Yme platform in the North Sea.  St. James’s Place lost 3.2 percent to 519.50 pence. Lloyds
sold 102 million shares in the company, leaving the bank with a
37 percent stake. Britain’s biggest mortgage lender said it will
make a gain of 400 million pounds ($596 million) from the sale
and the revaluation of its remaining holding. Lloyds added 1.2
percent to 50.6 pence.  Pirelli, Fraport  Pirelli retreated 4.2 percent to 8.55 euros after Europe’s
third-largest tiremaker forecast earnings before interest and
taxes of 810 million euros ($1.1 billion) to 850 million euros
in 2013. That compared with the  average analyst estimate  of 875
million euros in a Bloomberg survey.  Fraport AG dropped 4 percent to 43.24 euros, its biggest
decline in 10 months. The owner of Frankfurt airport forecast
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
in 2013 that fell short of analysts’ estimates. Fraport also
closed Frankfurt airport, which is the third largest in Europe,
because of snow.  Geberit AG (GEBN)  slipped 1.9 percent to 227.40 Swiss francs after
the Swiss toilet maker predicted that construction will probably
contract in Europe in 2013 as governments reel in spending and
lending. The company depends on the region for more than 90
percent of its  sales .  STMicroelectronics NV slid 4.6 percent to 5.81 euros after
six people familiar with the situation said the company has
failed to find a buyer for its wireless-chip joint venture with
Ericsson AB. The two firms will now consider winding down the
four-year-old ST-Ericsson as one option for its future, the
people said, asking not to be named because the discussions are
private. Potential buyers including Samsung Electronics Co.
declined to make an offer, said two people.  6  To contact the reporter on this story:
