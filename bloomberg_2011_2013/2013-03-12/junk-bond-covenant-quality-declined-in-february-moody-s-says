The strength of junk-bond
covenants, which are written into the terms of debt agreements
to protect investors, fell to the lowest level in at least two
years as measured by Moody’s Investors Service.  The average covenant score for speculative-grade bonds, in
which 1 is the strongest and 5 the weakest, was 3.96 last month,
the lowest since the rating company began tracking the data in
January 2011.  A high percentage of bonds with ratings in the highest
speculative-grade tier weakened the average because they
generally are sold with less investor protection, Alexander Dill, Moody’s lead covenant analyst, wrote in the report. About
56 percent of bonds issued in January and 36 percent in February
held ratings in the Ba class, according to the report.  “Bonds rated Ba and especially Ba1 generally have high-
yield lite covenant packages or full covenant packages ranking
low in covenant quality,” Dill wrote. “Investors are often
willing to accept less protection with comparatively less-risky
instruments.”  So-called high-yield lite bonds, which lack covenants
restricting a company’s ability to distribute cash to
shareholders or to incur more debt, accounted for 40 percent of
the issuance in February, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
