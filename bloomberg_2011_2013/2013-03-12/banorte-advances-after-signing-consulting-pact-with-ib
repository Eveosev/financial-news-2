Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB,
 Mexico ’s second-largest publicly traded bank, rallied the most
in a week after entering a consulting agreement with
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)   The stock advanced 2.2 percent to 93.53 pesos at the close
of Mexico City trading. It was the second-biggest advance on the
Mexican  IPC index  of stocks, which fell 0.1 percent.  The 10-year agreement will allow Mexico City-based Banorte
to cut costs as a percentage of revenue while increasing the
bank’s return on equity to more than 20 percent, the companies
said in a statement today on PR Newswire. Banorte’s ROE in 2012
was 14.3 percent, according to its year-end report.  “This is very good news,” Rafael Escobar, an analyst with
Vector Casa de Bolsa SA in Mexico City who rates the shares buy,
said in a telephone interview. “The investments in technology
will be useful to Banorte.”  Under the agreement, Armonk, New York-based IBM will
provide consulting, information technology and research and
development to create a “client-centric banking model” for
Banorte, according to the statement,  To contact the reporter on this story:
