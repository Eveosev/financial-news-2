Softbank Corp. (9984) , the Japanese
carrier buying 70 percent of  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  for about $20
billion, plans to reduce the maximum amount of the bridge loan
used for the acquisition after a bond sale.  Japan’s third-largest mobile phone operator will lower the
loan amount to 1.28 trillion yen ($13 billion) from 1.65
trillion yen announced in December, according to a  filing  to the
 Tokyo  Stock Exchange today. The Tokyo-based company raised 370
billion yen in bonds this month, including 300 billion yen of
1.47 percent notes due March 2017 for retail investors,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The country’s three megabanks -- Mizuho Corporate Bank
Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. -- are the loan’s mandated lead arrangers, along with
Deutsche Bank AG, according to the Dec. 17 statement. The
facility was split into two parts, with the 250 billion yen
portion of the loan drawn down on Dec. 21 and the remainder at
the time of the Sprint acquisition, it said.  “The company succeeded in raising more than expected from
the bond sale,” said Nobumasa Mizutani, the chief  investment
adviser  at Japan Credit Advisory Co., a hedge-fund advisory firm
in Tokyo. “This brings Softbank’s direct and indirect financing
to a better balance.”  Softbank is  ranked  A by JCR, the credit-rating company’s
sixth-highest investment grade, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
