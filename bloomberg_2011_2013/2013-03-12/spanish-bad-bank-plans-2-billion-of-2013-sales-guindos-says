Spain ’s bad bank is planning sales
of 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) this year as it starts selling
soured real estate transferred from lenders that took state aid,
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said.  “As you know, commercial activity has now started
beginning with the sale of real estate assets,” de Guindos told
a  congress  committee in Madrid today.  Lenders including the  Bankia (BKIA)  group that took state aid have
turned over 50.4 billion euros of assets to the bad bank as part
of a drive to clean up their balance sheets agreed under the
terms of a European bailout Spain sought for its financial
system last year. As many as 200,000 assets were transferred at
a gross discount to book value of 52 percent, and the bad bank,
known as Sareb, has 60 people handling them, de Guindos said.  Assets held by Sareb include 76,000 empty homes, 6,300
rented homes, 14,900 land plots and 84,300 loans, he said. Spain
has commissioned a detailed study of each asset so that Sareb’s
business plan can be revised, said de Guindos.  Under a business plan announced in October, Spain’s rescue
fund said it would strive for a 14 percent to 15 percent annual
return on equity over its life of about 15 years. The European
Commission said last month that coming up with a “sound
business plan” for Sareb would be crucial to its success.  To contact the reporter on this story:
