OAO Lukoil’s Litasco bought a cargo
of Forties crude at the lowest differential in almost 11 months.
Statoil ASA bid for Russian Urals blend at the highest spread in
near a month.  Daily exports of the 12 main grades of  North Sea  crude for
loading in April will increase 8 percent to the most in 10
months, loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Litasco bought Forties lot F0313 from Statoil at a discount
of 75 cents a barrel to Dated Brent for loading March 22 to
March 24, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring
the Platts pricing window showed. That’s the lowest since an
April 19 trade at minus 85 cents.  Trafigura Beheer BV failed to find a buyer for F0315
loading March 27 to March 29 at minus 35 cents, Royal Dutch
Shell Plc offered F0318 loading March 28 to March 30 also at a
35-cent discount without finding a buyer while BP Plc sought to
sell a April 2 to April 4 shipment at 10 cents less than Dated
Brent, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days dropped to a discount of 51 cents to Dated Brent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a
discount of 47 cents yesterday and is the lowest since June 22.  Brent for April settlement traded at $109.81 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $109.89 in the previous session. The May
contract was at $109.33, a discount of 48 cents to April.  Shipments of Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk, Statfjord,
Gullfaks, Alvheim, Aasgard, DUC, Flotta, Grane and Troll blends
will total 61.2 million barrels, or 2.04 million barrels a day,
compared with a revised 1.9 million this month. That is the
highest since June.  One 650,000 barrel cargo of Flotta crude will be exported
in April compared with none this month, according to a loading
plan obtained by  Bloomberg News .  South Korean refiners that import North Sea crudes stand to
receive smaller rebates on their oil-product exports under tax
changes scheduled to start April 1, according to government and
refinery officials.  Mediterranean/Urals  Statoil failed to find a seller for Urals at $1.85 a barrel
less than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam,
according to the Platts survey. That’s the smallest discount
since Feb. 15.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened by 5 cents to $2.40 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $2.38 a barrel,
compared with $2.75 in the previous session. That’s the
narrowest since Feb. 25.  South Sudan  and  Sudan  agreed to order companies to resume
southern oil shipments through a Red Sea export terminal within
two weeks, more than a year after they were halted over a
dispute about transportation fees.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 3 cents to $3.39
a barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
