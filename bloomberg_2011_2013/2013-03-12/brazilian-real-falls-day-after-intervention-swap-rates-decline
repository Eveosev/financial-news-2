Brazil ’s real dropped a day after
the central bank intervened to weaken the best-performing
emerging-market currency this year.  The currency depreciated almost 0.1 percent to 1.9577 per
 U.S. dollar  at 9:54 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Swap rates due in January
2014 decreased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
7.83 percent.  The real fell yesterday from a 10-month high as the central
bank sold $1 billion of reverse foreign-exchange swaps.
The currency has strengthened 4.8 percent in 2013, the most
among 25 emerging-market counterparts tracked by Bloomberg, as
inflation accelerated.  “The central bank has found a balance point for the real
between 1.95 and 2 per dollar,” Jose Carlos Amado, a currency
trader at Renascenca DTVM in Sao Paulo, said in a phone
interview. “The government has a clear concern with inflation
and depending on the flows it could let the real appreciate
more, but in the short term is comfortable with this level.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
