JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  was hit with a
denial-of-service cyber attack today that prevented customers
from banking online through the Chase.com website, according to
Michael Fusco, a company spokesman.  “We’re working to get Chase online back up to full
speed,” Fusco said by telephone. He said no customer data had
been affected.  A group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters
took responsibility for similar attacks on U.S. banks in
December, saying they were responding to a video on Google
Inc.’s YouTube.com ridiculing Islam’s Prophet Muhammad. The
attacks flood Internet sites with traffic, blocking access.  The group said in  an online posting  today it would keep up
the bank attacks, listing as additional targets: Bank of America
Corp., Citigroup Inc., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Fifth
Third Bancorp,  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , BB&T Corp., U.S.
Bancorp and Union Bank NA.  Carl Herberger, a vice president for the network security
firm Radware Ltd. In Tel-Aviv, said multiple banks were under
attack. He declined to say which ones.  To contact the reporters on this story:
