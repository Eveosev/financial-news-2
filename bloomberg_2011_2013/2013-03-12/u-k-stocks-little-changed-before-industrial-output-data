U.K. stocks were little changed,
paring early losses, as investors awaited data on the country’s
industrial production.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index fell less than 0.1 percent to
6,500.31 at 8:18 a.m. in  London . The gauge has still rallied 2.2
percent this month, for the longest winning streak since May
1997, on optimism central banks around the world will continue
to support economic recovery. The broader FTSE All-Share Index
and Ireland’s ISEQ Index were also little changed today.  U.K. manufacturing production was unchanged in January
after increasing 1.6 percent in December, economists estimated
before a report today. Total industrial production in the
European Union’s third-largest economy rose 0.1 percent in
January after gaining 1.1 percent the previous month, economists
predicted. The  Office for National Statistics  will release the
data at 9:30 a.m. in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
