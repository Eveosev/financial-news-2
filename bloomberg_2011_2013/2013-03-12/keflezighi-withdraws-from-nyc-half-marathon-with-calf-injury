Meb Keflezighi, the 2009  New York 
City Marathon champion, will miss the March 17 NYC Half Marathon
because of tightness in his calves, organizers said.  Keflezighi, the first American to win the New York marathon
in 27 years, was set to headline the professional field as part
of a U.S. contingent that includes Abdi Abdirahman and Dathan Ritzenhein.  Keflezighi said in a statement on the New York Road Runners
website that he decided to withdraw to prevent further injury
before the Boston Marathon on April 15.  Sunday’s 13.1-mile (21.1-kilometer) race will go from
 Central Park  to Manhattan’s South Street Seaport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
