OPEC boosted its crude production
to the highest in three months in February led by increased
output from Saudi Arabia and  Iraq .  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped
30.31 million barrels a day last month, the producer group said
in its monthly oil market report. That’s up from 30.24 million
in January and is the most since November, according to OPEC
estimates based on secondary sources. U.S. supplies will rise to
the most in almost three decades in 2013, OPEC estimated.  Brent crude prices have fallen 1 percent this year on
renewed concern that the  European debt crisis  will crimp global
growth and depress oil demand. The North Sea grade traded near
$110 a barrel today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. OPEC’s 12 members kept their collective output target of
30 million barrels a day unchanged at their last meeting in
December.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, increased
output to 9.12 million barrels a day in February from 9.08
million the previous month, OPEC said. The kingdom said in its
direct communication with the group that it pumped 9.15 million.  Iranian production in February was unchanged at 2.7 million
barrels a day, OPEC said. The country’s own estimate was 3.7
million, which would put it as the second-biggest producer.  U.S. supplies  are forecast to increase 580,000 barrels a
day this year to average 10.59 million barrels a day, which
would be the most since 1985, OPEC said. The gains will be
driven by rising tight oil output in  Texas  and North Dakota.  World oil demand growth is forecast to rise 840,000 barrels
a day this year to 89.67 million barrels a day, little changed
from last month’s report. The demand for OPEC’s crude is
estimated to average 29.7 million barrels a day in 2013.  The group will next gather on May 31 at its secretariat in
Vienna to discuss production policy. The International Energy
Agency will release its monthly report tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
