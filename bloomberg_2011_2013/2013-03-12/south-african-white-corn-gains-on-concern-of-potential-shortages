South African white-corn futures
gained to the highest in more than three months on speculation
that there may be a shortage of the grain.  White corn for delivery in July, the most-active contract,
rose 0.5 percent to 2,346 rand ($257) a metric ton, the highest
since Dec. 3, by the close on the South African Futures Exchange
in Johannesburg. The yellow variety declined 0.6 percent to
2,264 rand a ton.  White-corn stocks fell 16 percent to 2.2 million tons in
January from a month earlier, the South African Grain
Information Service said on Feb. 22. A lack of rain in some of
the nation’s main growing regions will probably result in lower-
than-average yields, analysts and traders at BVG (Pty) Ltd.,
Senwes Ltd., and Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd. have said this
month.  “There is a potential shortage for white corn,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG, said by phone from  Pretoria  today.  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as  animal feed . The country may reap 6.75 million tons of
white corn this season, 0.1 percent more than a year earlier,
the Crop Estimates Committee  said on Feb. 26 .  Wheat for May delivery increased 0.1 percent to 3,409 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
