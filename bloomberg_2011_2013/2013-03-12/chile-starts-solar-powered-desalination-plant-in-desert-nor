Chile’s government will start a
solar-powered desalination plant in the Atacama Desert and seeks
to expand use of the technology in the world’s largest copper-
producing nation.  The plant will operate in the Lluta Valley treating salty
water from a river to boost local agriculture, Fundacion Chile
said in a  statement  published in the Electricidad website today.
Fundacion Chile is a state-sponsored entity that promotes
technological innovation.  The plant will be Chile’s first powered by solar energy,
Fundacion Chile said. Mining companies including  Anglo American
Plc (AAL) ,  Cap SA (CAP)  and  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  are also
building desalination plants on the desert’s Pacific coastline
to expand copper and iron ore mining.  The success of the plant may lead to broader use of the
technology in the Atacama Desert, the driest place on earth,
Carolina Cuevas of Fundacion Chile said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
