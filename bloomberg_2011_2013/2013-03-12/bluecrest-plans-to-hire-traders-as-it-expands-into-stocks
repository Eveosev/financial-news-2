BlueCrest Capital Management LLP, the $35 billion hedge fund founded by  Michael Platt , plans a return to stocks after scaling back amid losses before the financial crisis, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  BlueCrest is in the process of hiring stock traders who would invest internal capital, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. London-based BlueCrest has already hired Christian Dalban, 48, to help oversee the effort after he held similar positions managing teams of equity traders at  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  and hedge fund Millennium Management LLC, the people said.  Platt, whose firm focuses on fixed-income investments and uses computer algorithms to profit from asset-price trends, decided to shut down a $500 million BlueCrest equity fund in 2007, predicting that the worsening credit crunch would spark a further slump for global stocks. BlueCrest is now joining  hedge funds  including Tudor Investment Corp. in looking to expand back into equities, after the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  rose to a record and as investors increasingly favor stocks over bonds.  “All asset managers are getting concerned that the beta play in fixed income is becoming extremely risky,” said Yariv Itah, a partner at Casey Quirk & Associates LLC, a Darien, Connecticut-based firm that advises hedge funds and other money managers. “They are preparing for a day when we move away from a trend of decreased interest rates to rising interest rates. They are beginning to plan on how they can provide returns for their investors in that kind of environment.”  Internal Capital  BlueCrest spokesman Ed Orlebar declined to comment on the hedge fund’s expansion into equities.  Dalban, who is based in London, left Nomura in February after  Tokyo ’s largest brokerage dismissed traders he oversaw, people familiar with the matter said at the time. BlueCrest has also held talks to hire Jonathan Larkin, Nomura’s former New York-based head of American equities who stepped down last month, the people said.  The hedge fund plans to provide internal money to stock traders it hires so they can develop an investing track record, said the people. It may try to raise assets from outside investors if the traders prove successful managing internal capital, the people said. The firm may hire at least a dozen traders in the initial push, one of the people said, adding that a precise number hasn't been set.  BlueCrest’s earlier equity fund was down 8 percent for the year when Platt decided to shut it down in August 2007.  Changed Sentiment  Fixed income has attracted about $1.2 trillion of net investments since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, according to Deutsche Bank AG research, as market participants sought safety from the meltdown of the U.S. housing market and  Europe ’s debt crisis. Inflows into stocks were unchanged from the end of 2008 through last year, it said.  Sentiment changed in the first two months of this year, with stocks drawing a net $73 billion of new money, the Frankfurt-based bank said in a Feb. 27 note. Stocks may outperform as global economic growth accelerates, concerns over Europe fade, investors shun low-yielding bonds, and healthier companies repurchase shares and buy competitors, it said.  BlueCrest has at times restricted client investments into its BlueTrend strategy and other hedge funds to ensure they don’t become too big to produce good returns. While BlueTrend has posted an average annual gain of 15 percent since starting in 2004, its returns were little changed in 2011 and 2012, said an investor, who declined to be identified because the matter is private.  Tudor Investment  Platt, 44, started BlueCrest in 2000 after leaving a proprietary trading desk at New York-based  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  He manages BlueCrest’s $13.7 billion Capital International fund. Dalban worked for JPMorgan until 2005, where his titles included global co-head of equity derivatives. Larkin, 38, previously ran U.S. single-stock volatility trading at JPMorgan.  Paul Tudor Jones ’s $11.6 billion Tudor Investment is considering starting its first equity fund since stock manager James Pallotta left the firm in 2009, people familiar with the matter said last month. New York-based Tudor is a  macro hedge  fund that invests in currencies and interest rates based on traders’ views of global macroeconomic trends.  Patrick Clifford , a spokesman for Tudor, declined to comment on the firm’s plans.  CQS Hiring  CQS U.K. LLP, a $11.2 billion hedge fund based in London that invests in convertible bonds, corporate debt and asset- backed securities, has been adding staff to focus on stocks. It hired equity trader David Morant and analyst Ben Halfacre from SAC Capital Advisors LLC,  Steven Cohen ’s $14 billion hedge fund, according to registrations with the U.K. Financial Services Authority. CQS also added analysts Daniel Woodbridge and Alex Torrance from Marble Bar Asset Management LLP and Saxlingham Asset Management LLP, respectively, records show.  “We’ve been adding staff in equities,”  Michael Hintze , CQS’s co-founder, said in an emailed statement. “It is a natural extension of our expertise across the  capital structure  and we believe it adds value to our investment process and investor returns.”  Hedge fund clients plan to add the most money in 2013 to equity funds, which they expect to outperform all other strategies, according to investor surveys published by Deutsche Bank and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) .  ‘More Stable’  This view marks a reversal from 2012 when investors pulled assets from stock-picking hedge funds after they underperformed benchmarks.  Equity funds  rose 1.2 percent on average for the two years ended in 2011, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc., trailing the 14 percent gain of the benchmark  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)   Still, pension funds may remain reluctant to add money to hedge funds that bet on rising and falling stock prices. Those institutions already have “significant” direct equity holdings, Deutsche Bank said in its Feb. 25 investor survey.  Hedge funds often prefer pension funds over other clients, because they commit larger amounts of money for longer periods of time, said Jaime Castan, who last year stepped down as co- head of hedge-fund investing at LGT Capital Partners AG in Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland .  “Pension fund money has a reputation for being more stable,” Castan said in a telephone interview.
