Mexico’s short-term bond yields
fell to record lows amid speculation policy makers will keep
benchmark borrowing costs unchanged after cutting them for the
first time in more than three years last week.  Yields on peso-denominated debt due in December fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.07 percent at 7:07
a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 12.4959 per dollar.  Central bank policy makers said in a March 8 statement
after lowering the reference rate by a half-percentage point to
a record 4 percent that the reduction “doesn’t represent the
start of a cycle.” Yields on shorter-term debt should converge
to 4 percent as investors expect policy makers to stay on hold,
according to Alejandro Urbina, a portfolio manager at Silva
Capital Management.  The yields “continue to adjust to the move lower” by the
central bank, Urbina said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“It is more an adjustment about how long the reference rate
will stay at the new low.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
