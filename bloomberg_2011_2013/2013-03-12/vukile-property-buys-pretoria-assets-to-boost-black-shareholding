Vukile Property Fund Ltd. (VKE)  agreed to
buy five investment-grade sites from Encha Properties for cash
and shares that will see it comply with  South Africa ’s black
ownership laws.  Vukile will pay 800 million rand ($88 million) in cash and
issue shares worth 600 million rand to Encha, the Johannesburg-
based fund said today in a statement. The properties are
“predominantly” occupied by national government departments
and four of the five units are in  Pretoria , Vukile said.  “Post the transaction, Encha will own an ungeared
approximate 600 million rand stake in Vukile,” the company
said. “This will represent an approximate 25 percent holding in
Vukile, after adjusting for mandated investments.”  South African law requires companies with annual revenue of
more than 5 million rand to sell 25 percent of their local
operations to black citizens with transactions that benefit
workers, women and disabled people favored. The government takes
this ownership into account when it decides to buy from private
companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
