The naira fell for a third day, set
for its lowest level in almost four months as importers in
 Africa ’s second-biggest economy increased demand for dollars to
pay their bills.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer declined 0.1
percent to 158.43 per dollar by 12:16 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, the lowest on a closing basis since Nov. 16,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The naira has slipped
1.4 percent this year.  The naira’s weakness is “largely due to increased
corporate demand to cover import bills and other foreign-
exchange obligations,” Kunle Ezun and Kenneth Asenime, Lagos-
based strategists at Ecobank Transnational Inc., wrote in a note
to clients today.  Nigeria relies on imports to cover 70 percent of its own
fuel needs because of inadequate refining capacity, and those
shipments into the country are a source of pressure on the
naira, according to the central bank. Bonny Light Crude, the
nation’s main export grade, slid for a third day, dropping 0.5
percent to $112.39 in New York.  “Although the naira has a weakening outlook, the steady
rise in reserves to $47.9 billion -- around 10 months equivalent
of imports -- provides a large cushion to support the naira in
the weeks ahead,” said Ezun and Asenime.  Nigeria’s  foreign-currency reserves  have advanced 8 percent
this year to $47.9 billion, according to March 8 data compiled
by the Central Bank of Nigeria in the capital, Abuja.  The bank sold $180 million at an auction yesterday,
compared with $150 million at the previous sale on March 6. The
bank sells dollars to lenders on Mondays and Wednesdays to help
stabilize the naira.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 4.116
percent. Borrowing costs on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic
bonds due January 2022 declined 12 basis points to 11.14
percent, according to yesterday’s data compiled on the  Financial
Markets Dealers Association  website.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.1 percent to 1.9225 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
