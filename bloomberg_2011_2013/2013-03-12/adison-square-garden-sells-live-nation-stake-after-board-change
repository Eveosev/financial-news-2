Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG)  sold its
$44 million stake in  Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , severing
ties with the concert promoter after MSG Chairman  James Dolan 
stepped down from Live Nation’s board last month.  MSG, the New York sports and entertainment company that
owns the Knicks and Rangers, sold all of its approximately 3.9
million shares in Live Nation, according to a statement today.  Dolan’s resignation, which was announced in a filing by
Live Nation in February, followed Irving Azoff’s decision to
step down as chairman of the company in December. MSG acquired
its stake as part of a transaction Live Nation completed in
February 2011, when it bought the remaining 25 percent of
Azoff’s Front Line Management Group that it didn’t already own.  Shares of Live Nation, the world’s largest concert promoter
and ticket seller, rose 0.2 percent to $11.65 at the close in
New York. MSG’s stock fell 1 percent to $55.42.  Dolan, who also serves as chief executive officer of
 Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , had joined Live Nation’s board in
June 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
