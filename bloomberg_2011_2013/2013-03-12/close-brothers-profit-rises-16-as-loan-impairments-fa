Close Brothers Group Plc (CBG) , the
British financial services company founded in 1878, said profit
for the first half rose 16 percent as loan impairments fell.  Net income for the six months to Jan. 31 rose to 58.8
million pounds ($87.6 million) from 50.5 million pounds, the
London-based lender said in a statement. Loan impairments fell
14 percent to 25.8 million pounds.  Close Brothers has been restructuring its funds business
and in 2011 sold its advisory, U.K. offshore and Cayman Islands
operations to focus on banking, securities and asset management.
The lender’s loan book grew 6 percent.  “Our margins stayed solid and bad debts improved,” Chief
Executive Officer Preben Prebensen said in a telephone
interview. The lender’s average 13-month duration for loans
means it can quickly re-price riskier loans, he said.  Close Brothers fell 5 pence, or 0.5 percent, to 1,080
pence, at 9:23 a.m. local time, valuing the bank at 1.59 billion
pounds. The lender has risen 25 percent this year.  -- Editors:  Keith Campbell , Jon Menon  To contact the reporter on this story:
