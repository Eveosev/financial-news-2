Brian Hoffmann, co-chairman of
Clifford Chance LLP’s mergers and acquisitions practice in the
Americas, will rejoin McDermott Will & Emery LLP as a partner.  Hoffmann is returning to McDermott’s  New York  office, where
he was a partner from 1995 to 1999, McDermott said today in an
e-mailed statement.  Hoffmann’s “long history leading sophisticated corporate
transactions, including public mergers and acquisitions, will
enable us to meet growing demand from clients all over the
world,” David Goldman, head of McDermott’s corporate advisory
practice group, said in the statement.  Hoffmann, a graduate of Georgetown University Law Center,
specializes in M&A, high-yield and other complex corporate
transactions, according to his biography on Clifford Chance’s
website. He was a partner at that firm since 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
