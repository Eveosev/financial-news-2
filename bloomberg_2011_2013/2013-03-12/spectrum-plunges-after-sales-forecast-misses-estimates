  Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SPPI) , a
maker of cancer medicines, plunged as much as 44 percent after
the drugmaker said full-year sales would fall far short of
analystsâ€™ estimates.  Shares  declined  to $7.95 at 5:49 p.m.  New York  time in
extended trading, after closing at $12.43. The Henderson,
Nevada-based company dropped as low as $7 after the forecast was
released.  Annual 2013 revenue will be $160 million to $180 million,
Spectrum said today in a statement. Analysts anticipated total
revenue of $297 million, according to the average of five
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company said sales of its
top product, Fusilev, will be $80 million to $90 million.  Spectrum cited shifting ordering patterns for Fusilev, an
injection known chemically as levoleucovorin, as well as the
increased use of generic drugs by hospitals, for the sales
forecast.  Fusilev first won FDA approval in 2008 for patients with a
bone tumor called osteosarcoma. The agency two years ago cleared
the drug as a treatment for patients with advanced  colon cancer .
The treatment generated $204 million in  sales  last year,
Spectrum reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
