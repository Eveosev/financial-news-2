The operator of parking garages at
the new Yankee Stadium, which haven’t generated enough revenue
to pay $240 million in tax-exempt debt, has hired bankruptcy
attorneys, according to a  securities filing . [bn:WBTKR=84882MF:US]   Bronx Parking Development Corp. [] will pay Willkie Farr &
Gallagher $18,750 a month to serve as bankruptcy counsel,
according to the corporation’s 2013 operating budget filed with
the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.  Bronx Parking is in discussions with creditors and isn’t
planning a bankruptcy filing, Edward Moran, the firm’s chief
restructuring officer, said in a telephone interview.  “We’re still trying to work things through with
bondholders,” Moran said, declining to offer specifics. “It’s
very, very delicate times.”  The garages and lots, which have about 9,300 spaces, have
suffered as more fans take public transportation to Major League
Baseball games and drivers balk at paying $35 to park. The
facilities averaged about 4,000 cars on event days and had an
occupancy rate of 43 percent, according to filings. The Yankees
have exclusive use of 600 spaces.  Subsidized Parking  Nuveen Asset Management is the biggest holder of Bronx
Parking debt, with $116.1 million of bonds maturing in 2037 and
2046 as of Feb. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Chicago-based company held $15 million in bonds maturing in 2017
and 2027 as of Jan. 31.  Bonds maturing in 2046 traded on March 8 at 42.5 cents on
the dollar, the data show.  Bronx Parking issued $237.6 million of municipal bonds in
2007 through  New York City ’s Industrial Development Agency to
build three garages, renovate two others and refurbish six lots
near the 50,287-seat Yankee Stadium. It opened in 2009 adjacent
to the site of the team’s old ballpark.  The project received a $70 million subsidy from New York
state and about $39 million from the city.  Bronx Parking’s next interest payment of $6.9 million is
due April 1 and there is an $8.1 million payment due Oct. 1.  The corporation had about $13.5 million in various funds as
of Dec. 31, 2012 which will decline to about $6 million at the
end of 2013, according to the budget. Net operating income is
forecast at $4.8 million.  A message for Willkie’s chief marketing officer, Antoinette McGovern, wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
