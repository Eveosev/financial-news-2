China ’s crude processing fell to
the lowest level in four months in February as the nation
celebrated the week-long Lunar new year holiday.  Daily  oil-refining  volumes in the world’s second-largest
crude user dropped to 9.9 million barrels a day last month,
according to figures from the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing. That’s the lowest since October. January processing
was at about 10.1 million, combined data for the first two
months of the year show.  China’s factories slowed or halted activity during the
Lunar new year holiday from Feb. 9 to Feb. 15 as travelers went
back to their hometowns to celebrate with their families. Crude
processing in the first two months of 2013 rose 3 percent from
the same period in 2012.  The nation’s  crude output  climbed 0.8 percent to 16 million
tons last month, while  natural gas production  gained 5.2 percent
to 9.57 billion cubic meters, today’s data show.  Gasoline output 
soared 13 percent to 7.9 million tons, and  diesel production 
fell 2.7 percent to 13.6 million tons.  China’s apparent oil demand, or domestic crude processing
plus net imports, was 10.2 million barrels a day, the lowest
since October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
figures was up 4.4 percent from a year ago.  China’s biggest oil refineries cut their average operating
rates by 4.5 percentage points from two weeks ago to 83.7
percent as of March 7 because of refinery maintenance,
Oilchem.net, a Shandong-based industry website, said last week.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
