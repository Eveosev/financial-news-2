China Everbright Bank Co. (601818)  has won
board approval to sell as many as 12 billion shares in  Hong
Kong , moving closer to listing in the city after scrapping a
stock sale last year.  The offer will take place within the next 18 months and
comply with the period given to the company to sell shares, with
the exact timing determined “according to the state of global
and Chinese capital markets,” the lender said in a  statement  to
the Shanghai stock exchange.  China Everbright Bank had planned to raise as much as $6
billion from a share sale in Hong Kong, before scaling that back
to about $1.7 billion and then delaying the offering in August,
citing sluggish  capital markets  and low valuations on banking
shares.  The proceeds will be used to “bolster its core capital,
raise the bank’s capital adequacy ratio and strengthen its
ability to weather risks,” China Everbright Bank said in the
statement. A Hong Kong listing would also help it improve
profitability and support the “healthy expansion of its various
businesses,” it said.  The lender said in August that it would restart listing
preparations when there was a “relatively good window.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
