JSE Ltd. (JSE) , which operates the
 Johannesburg Stock Exchange , said full-year profit fell 12
percent on lower trading revenue even as the group moved its
trading platform back to  South Africa  from London.  Net income declined to 302 million rand ($33 million) for
the 12 months through December, compared with 342 million rand a
year earlier, the company said in a statement today. Diluted
earnings per share excluding one-time items fell 15.9 percent to
4.73 rand, beating the 4.30 rand median estimate of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “In common with most other cash equity exchanges around
the world, our equity market trade execution revenues
declined,” the company said today in a statement.  The exchange returned its trading platform to Johannesburg
from  London  last year to allow faster trades and generate higher
revenue, Chief Executive Officer Nicky Newton-King said in March
2012. The number of transactions on the exchange was little
changed at 26.9 million in 2012, compared with 26.5 million the
year before, the company said.  JSE shares dropped as much as 0.7 percent and were 0.1
percent lower at 76.40 rand by 3:10 p.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
