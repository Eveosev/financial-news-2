Royal Nickel Corp. (RNX) , the owner of a
nickel project in  Quebec , gained the most in six months after
the company signed a memorandum of understanding with Tsingshan
Holding Group Co., a Chinese stainless-steel producer.  Royal Nickel rose 22 percent to 39.5 Canadian cents at 9:57
a.m. in Toronto, where the company is based. The shares earlier
gained 23 percent, the most intraday since Aug. 24.  The two companies will consider offtake and partnership
agreements after a feasibility study is completed on Royal
Nickel’s Dumont project, the company said today in a statement.
Tsingshan also expects to build a plant that would use nickel
sulphide concentrate, which will be produced at Dumont, to
produce stainless steel.  The news is “a positive first step” towards Royal Nickel
securing a senior partner for development of the Dumont project,
John Hughes, a Toronto-based analyst at Desjardins Securities
Inc. said in a note today. Hughes rates the company a buy with a
price target of C$1.95.  To contact the reporter on this story:
