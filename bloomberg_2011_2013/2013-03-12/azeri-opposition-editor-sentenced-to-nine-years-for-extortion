An Azeri court today sentenced an
opposition editor to nine years in prison for extortion and
bribery, charges the defense team rejected as politically
motivated.  The Serious Crimes Court in the capital, Baku, also
convicted Avaz Zeynalli, editor of the  Xural  newspaper, of tax
evasion, defense lawyer Yalcin Imanov said by phone.  “This is an unlawful verdict given by a political order,”
Imanov said, adding that they plan to appeal.  Zeynalli was arrested in 2011 following complaints by Gular
Ahmadova, then a senior member of the ruling New Azerbaijan
Party and a member of parliament.  Ahmadova herself was arrested last month on fraud charges.
She’s accused of swindling $1 million from a former university
rector whom she allegedly promised to secure a seat in
parliament before a 2005 election. She denies the charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
