Swiss stocks  climbed to their
highest level since February 2008 as bank shares advanced,
offsetting a decline in the shares of Geberit AG.  Swatch Group AG (UHR)  and Cie. Financiere Richemont SA led gains.
UBS AG rose as a person familiar with the matter said the lender
has held talks to buy Italy’s Banca Intermobiliare di
Investimenti e Gestioni SpA. Geberit fell the most in more than
four months as the maker of toilets and bathroom-piping systems
predicted a difficult year for the construction industry.  The SMI added 0.6 percent to 7,802.93 at the close of
trading in Zurich, its highest level since February 2008. The
SMI rallied 1.9 percent last week as the unemployment rate fell
in the U.S. and speculation mounted that central banks around
the world will continue to support economic recovery. The
broader Swiss Performance Index increased 0.5 percent today.  “The equities market in  Europe  seems to be only trading
one way: up,” Ion-Marc Valahu, co-founder and fund manager at
Clairinvest in Geneva, wrote. “No amount of bad news is
seemingly able to derail this progress.”  The volume of shares changing hands in shares listed on the
 SMI (SMI)  was 23 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  European Union leaders will meet at a summit in Brussels on
March 14-15 to discuss the terms of a bailout for Cyprus. These
include the nation’s debt sustainability and whether to impose
losses on depositors.  Swatch, Richemont  Swatch, the largest maker of Swiss watches, gained 0.9
percent to 545 francs as Societe Generale SA rated the shares
new buy, forecasting a target price of 650 francs for the
shares. Richemont increased 1.4 percent to 78.65 francs as the
French bank rated the stock new buy, setting a target price of
95 francs.  UBS AG (UBSN)  added 0.3 percent to 15.14 Swiss francs. The stock
earlier rose as much as 0.9 percent. Switzerland’s biggest
lender has held talks to buy Banca Intermobiliare as it seeks to
expand its private-banking business, according to a person
familiar with the discussions.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s second-largest
lender, climbed 0.7 percent to 26.27 Swiss francs.  EFG Financial Products Holding AG (FPHN)  surged 6.5 percent to
52.50 francs, the biggest jump since its initial public offering
in October, after Notenstein Private Bank agreed to buy a 20.25
percent stake in the financial-services firm from  EFG
International AG. (EFGN)   Notenstein, which is owned by St. Gallen, Switzerland-based
Raiffeisen Group, agreed to buy the stake for 70.2 million
francs ($74 million), according to an e-mailed statement from
EFG International today.  Geberit (GEBN)  fell 1.9 percent to 227.40 francs. The toilet maker
said that the European construction industry will probably
contract this year. The company generates more than 90 percent
of its sales from Europe. Geberit also said it will pay a
dividend of 6.60 francs per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
