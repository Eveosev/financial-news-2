Purchases of cocoa beans in Ivory
Coast, the biggest producer, fell 7.5 percent in the first three
months of the 2012-13 season, according to a document from the
ministries of finance and agriculture.  Cocoa deliveries to ports from farms in the country’s
interior amounted to 649,249 metric tons in the period from Oct.
1 to Dec. 31, according to the document, sent to Bloomberg by a
finance ministry official who asked not to be identified because
the figures aren’t public yet. That compares with 702,127 tons a
year earlier.  Exports of cocoa beans increased 4.1 percent to 503,946
tons in the period, the document showed. Farm-gate prices, set
this season at 725 CFA francs ($1.44) a kilogram (2.2 pounds),
gained 3.6 percent from an average of 700 francs a year earlier,
according to the document. Cocoa producers’ revenue declined to
470.7 billion CFA francs from 491.5 billion francs a year
earlier, the document showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
