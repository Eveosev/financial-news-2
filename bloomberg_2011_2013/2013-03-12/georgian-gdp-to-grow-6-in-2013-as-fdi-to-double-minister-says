Georgia ’s economy will expand 6
percent in 2013 as government-backed funds and state guarantees
lure back foreign capital, Finance Minister Nodar Khaduri said.  Foreign direct investment will reach $2 billion this year,
buoyed by the efforts of billionaire Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili’s government, Khaduri told reporters today in the
capital, Tbilisi. FDI fell to $865 million in 2012 from $1.1
billion the previous year. Gross domestic product advanced 6.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
