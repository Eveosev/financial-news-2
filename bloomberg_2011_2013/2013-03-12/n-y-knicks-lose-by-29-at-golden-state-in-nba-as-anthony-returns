Carmelo Anthony’s return from a
three-game injury absence could not prevent the  New York Knicks 
from losing by 29 points at the  Golden State Warriors  in a
National Basketball Association game.  The Warriors won 92-63 at the Oracle Arena in Oakland,
 California , matching the fewest points they have allowed in a
game in six decades.  Anthony, returning from a knee injury, scored 14 points on
4-for-15 shooting. The Knicks shot an NBA season-low 27.4
percent and went 5-of-27 (18.5 percent) on 3-pointers.  “We had nothing going offensively, shots that we normally
make we just didn’t make,” Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  told
reporters. “We played one quarter tonight, after that we had
nothing in our tank.”  The 63 points scored by the Knicks were the fewest by a
Warriors opponent since the Philadelphia Warriors defeated the
Milwaukee Hawks 69-63 on Dec. 28, 1953, the Warriors said. The
Warriors hadn’t held an opponent to such a low shooting
percentage since  Washington  shot 26.9 percent on Nov. 22, 1975.  “That’s a heck of a defensive night, I don’t know how many
teams in history have nights like that,” Warriors coach Mark
Jackson said in a news conference. “It takes a combination of
great defense and at times bad offense. I wish we could take the
credit, but it’s a combination.”  Stephen Curry had 26 points, Klay Thompson had 23 and
former Knick David Lee added 21 points, 10 rebounds and eight
assists for the Warriors (36-29), who went 11-of-20 from 3-point
range.  Road Trip  The Knicks (38-23), who are starting a five-game road trip
that continues tomorrow night in Denver, were held to nine
points in the fourth quarter against a team that had been
allowing 101 points per game.  Chris Copeland led the Knicks with 15 points off the bench.
Anthony played 34 minutes in his first action since hurting his
knee on March 4 at  Cleveland .  “He was a little sluggish, we expected that,” Woodson
said. “He’s been out a few games, he looked a little rusty.”  New York’s J.R. Smith was ejected from the game for a
flagrant foul on Harrison Barnes midway through the third period
with the Knicks trailing by 24 points.  The Brooklyn Nets failed to make up ground on the Knicks,
losing 106-97 at the  Philadelphia 76ers  to stay 2 1/2 games
behind New York in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic division.  The  San Antonio Spurs  defeated the visiting Oklahoma City
Thunder 105-93 last night to stay atop the Western Conference
standings with a 49-15 record. The Thunder fell to 47-17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
