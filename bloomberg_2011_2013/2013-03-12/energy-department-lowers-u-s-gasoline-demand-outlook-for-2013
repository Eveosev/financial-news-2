The U.S. Energy Department
maintained its forecast for gasoline prices at the pump in 2013
and lowered its estimate for gasoline demand.  Regular-grade gasoline will average $3.55 a gallon this
year, the same as in last month’s forecast, the department’s
Energy Information Administration said today in its monthly
 Short-Term Energy Outlook . Prices in 2012 averaged $3.63 a
gallon.  Prices may average $3.38 in 2014, the department estimated,
down from $3.39 in last month’s forecast.  Gasoline  consumption  this year will average 8.71 million
barrels a day, down from 8.73 million in last month’s
projection. Demand in 2014 may be 8.71 million barrels a day,
down from last month’s forecast of 8.72 million.  Distillate demand, including heating oil and diesel, will
be 3.75 million barrels a day this year, down from the last
month’s outlook of 3.77 million. Consumption in 2014 is
estimated to be 3.81 million barrels a day, down from the
previous projection of 3.83 million.  The department expects households heating primarily with
oil to spend an average of about $2,442 during the winter season
from Oct. 1 to March 31. That’s 17 percent higher than last
year, as a result of a 4.1 percent increase in prices and a 12
percent increase in consumption. In February, the EIA forecast
consumers would spend an average of about $2,459.  About 6 percent of U.S. households depend on heating oil
for space heating. The Northeast accounts for about 80 percent
of these households.  To contact the reporters on this story:
