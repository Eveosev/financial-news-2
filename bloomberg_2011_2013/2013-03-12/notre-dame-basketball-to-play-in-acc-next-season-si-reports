The University of  Notre Dame ’s
basketball teams will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference next
season, Sports Illustrated reported.  Notre Dame said last September that it would join the ACC
in all league-sponsored sports except football as soon as it
could exit the  Big East  Conference. The Big East presidents will
vote on the issue today, SI reported, citing an unidentified
person with direct knowledge of the situation.  The ACC was able to accommodate Notre Dame as the league’s
basketball schedule hasn’t been completed for the 2013-14 season,
SI said on its website. The ACC will have 15 basketball schools
next season, when it also adds Syracuse and Pittsburgh from the
Big East.  Notre Dame’s planned departure comes after the Big East
last week reached an exit agreement with seven schools --DePaul,
Georgetown, Marquette, Providence,  Seton Hall , St. John’s and
Villanova -- whose top sports program is men’s basketball. The
agreement clears the way for the so-called Catholic 7 to start a
new league and take the conference name next season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
