(Corrects unit in fourth paragraph.)  West  Texas  Intermediate crude on
the  spot market  in Midland, Texas, rose to its first premium
since 2010 to oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, as a pipeline connecting
the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast prepares to start.  Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  expects in mid-March to
begin filling its reversed Longhorn pipeline system, which will
carry crude to the Houston area from Crane, Texas, said Bruce Heine, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based spokesman for the company. The
pipeline will begin deliveries of about 75,000 barrels a day in
mid-April and expand to 225,000 in the third quarter.  “When the Longhorn starts up, that’s the important one for
the Permian, and I expect line fill is currently going on now,”
said Amrita Sen, chief oil market analyst for Energy Aspects
Ltd. in London. “Essentially, the Permian is starting to clear
up as these phase-one pipelines come online.”  WTI in Midland strengthened by 45 cents to a premium of 10
cents a barrel to crude in Cushing at 12:14 p.m.  New York  time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the first premium
since May 21, 2010.  West Texas Sour in Midland strengthened by 60 cents to 25
cents a barrel below WTI in Cushing, the smallest discount since
April 21, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
