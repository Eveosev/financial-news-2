Ukraine failed to attract two loans
totaling 221.9 million euros ($288.7 million) in a tender to
finance construction of a liquefied natural-gas terminal because
less than two bids were made and the tender was canceled,
 Kommersant-Ukraine  newspaper reported, citing tender information
it obtained.  Ukraine may cancel the LNG project altogether should talks
with  Russia  on lowering price for natural gas imports be
successful, the Kiev-based newspaper cited an official at the
Energy and Coal Ministry who did not want to be named.  To contact the reporter on this story:
