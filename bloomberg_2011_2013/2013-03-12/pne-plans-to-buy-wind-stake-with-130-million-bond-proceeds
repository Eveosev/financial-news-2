PNE Wind AG (PNE3) , the German wind power
developer, plans to use proceeds from issuing 100 million euros
($130 million) in corporate bonds to fund the purchase of more
than 50 percent of an onshore wind company.  PNE Wind, based in Cuxhaven, is in talks with a company it
didnâ€™t identify over a possible sale, it said today in an e-
mailed statement. An initial price indication for all the shares
in the business, which mainly develops onshore wind in Germany
and abroad, is 100 million euros, according to PNE Wind.  The company, planning to issue the bonds in the first half,
may also use proceeds to buy wind farms on land and at sea in
 Germany  and abroad as it seeks to expand, according to the
statement. It may also invest equity in its German wind
projects, which it could sell on to investors once the ventures
are commissioned, it said. The company currently has about 180
megawatts of wind in the approval process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
