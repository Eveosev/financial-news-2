New York Knicks leading scorer
Carmelo Anthony will return tonight at the Golden State Warriors
after missing three games with a knee injury, coach  Mike Woodson 
told reporters.  Forward Amar’e Stoudemire had knee surgery today in New
York and is expected to be sidelined for six weeks, Knicks
spokesman  Jonathan Supranowitz  said.  Woodson said playing time for Anthony, who is averaging
28.2 points per game this season, will depend on how he feels
during the game at Oakland, California.  “He hasn’t been on the floor in a while, I have to gauge
how he’s moving around,” Woodson said. “I’m just going to
watch how he’s moving, the flow.”  Anthony, 28, was injured during the Knicks’ win March 4 at
Cleveland and missed the past three games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
