A  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  safety executive
testified he didn’t authorize post-explosion tests on the type
of cement used on the  BP Plc (BP/)  well that blew up in the  Gulf of
Mexico  and was surprised when he heard about them a year later.  BP contends the tests were intentionally discarded amid a
Halliburton employee’s fear of litigation and despite protective
orders following the disaster. Houston-based Halliburton
provided cementing services for the well, which exploded in
April 2010, setting off the largest offshore  oil spill  in U.S.
history.  Tommy Roth, Halliburton vice president, said at trial today
in  New Orleans  that these tests weren’t authorized and he didn’t
know about them when he testified three times before the  U.S.
Congress  in 2010 about the company’s role on the doomed Macondo
well. Under cross-examination today by a BP lawyer, Roth said he
learned in April 2011 that a Halliburton employee had conducted
unauthorized tests and in 2012 that the results were discarded.  “I was surprised,” Roth said today.  11 Killed  The blowout and explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon
killed 11 workers and spilled more than 4 million barrels of oil
into the Gulf of Mexico. The accident sparked hundreds of
lawsuits against London-based BP, owner of the well; Vernier,
Switzerland-based  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , owner of the Deepwater
Horizon; and Houston-based Halliburton.  The nonjury trial over liability for the disaster began
Feb. 25. U.S. District Judge  Carl Barbier  will determine
responsibility and whether one or more of the companies acted
with willful or wanton misconduct or reckless indifference --
the legal requirement for establishing gross negligence.  Lawyers for the government and spill victims contend BP was
over budget and behind schedule on the Macondo deep-water
drilling project off the  Louisiana  coast, prompting the company
to cut corners and ignore safety tests showing the well was
unstable.  They also allege Halliburton’s cement job was defective and
Transocean employees made a series of missteps on the rig,
including disabling safety systems, failing to properly maintain
the installation and leaving the crew untrained for crisis
situations.  Worker Miscues  BP sued its contractors, claiming Transocean workers’
miscues were the main cause of the explosion and that
Halliburton officials concealed flaws with cement work done on
the drilling project. Transocean and Halliburton countersued,
pointing the finger back at BP on liability issues.  Halliburton has withheld information about the cement job
from BP, the  oil company  has claimed. In a filing today, the
company said Halliburton failed to provide Macondo well cement
samples to BP following repeated requests after the spill.  BP also contends that Halliburton conducted its own tests
and threw them out, never providing the results to anyone.  BP alleged in a December 2011 court filing that Halliburton
employee Rickey Morgan reported a discarded test to lab
supervisor Ron Faul, who then ordered employee Tim Quirk to
verify the stability of the cement slurry delivered to Macondo,
but not to create a record of the test or its results.  After the blast, Roth testified today, Faul, Quirk and
Morgan didn’t tell him about the cement company’s post-incident
tests.  Cement Slurry  Roth said he didn’t ask Faul to test the cement job
Halliburton used on the Deepwater Horizon. He also didn’t ask
Faul not to test the cement slurry, Roth said. Faul had reported
to him about the cement used in the project, Roth said today in
his second day of testimony.  “He saw no unusual elements that would raise any
significant concerns,” Roth said of Faul’s e-mailed report.
“He said it looked like a good job.”  Another Halliburton executive,  Tim Probert , testified
yesterday that he learned in 2012 that the unauthorized tests
had been discarded.  Brad Brian, a Transocean attorney, asked Probert yesterday
whether he was angry when he was told two years later that the
tests had been destroyed.  “Yeah. Obviously it doesn’t make you feel happy,” Probert
replied.  Gregg Perkin, an engineering expert for the plaintiffs,
testified today that the well could have been shut down after
the explosion and before the spill if the blow-out preventer had
an acoustic-monitoring device.  Offer Declined  Perkin said the acoustic monitoring device was “offered”
to Transocean and BP several years before the rig blast. The
companies declined, he testified.  At the time of the explosion, the device was required in
oil fields of the  North Sea  and  Brazil  and not in the Gulf of
Mexico, Jim Williamson, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in
trial today.  Perkin agreed the acoustic device wasn’t required by
regulators in the Gulf of Mexico.  “It’s been well established the blow-out preventer met all
of its certification and maintenance requirements,”  Jared
Allen , a Transocean spokesman, said after Perkin testified.  The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, 10-md-02179,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New
Orleans).  To contact the reporters on this story:
