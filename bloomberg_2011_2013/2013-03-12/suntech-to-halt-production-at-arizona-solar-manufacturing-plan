Suntech Power Holdings Co. plans to
stop production at its Goodyear,  Arizona , solar-panel
manufacturing facility in April.  Forty-three employees will be affected, Suntech said in a
statement today.  Higher production costs because of U.S. import tariffs on
solar cells and aluminum frames contributed to the decision,
according to the statement. The company previously announced
plans to cut operating expenses by 20 percent in 2013.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
