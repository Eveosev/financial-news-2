EON SE, Germany’s largest utility,
hired Leonhard Birnbaum of  RWE AG (RWE)  for its management board and
extended Chief Executive Officer Johannes Teyssen’s contract.  EON’s supervisory board extended Teyssen and Management
Board Member Jorgen Kildahl’s contracts until the end of 2018,
the Dusseldorf-based company said today in a statement.  Klaus-Dieter Maubach and Regine Stachelhaus will be
replaced by Birnbaum and Mike Winkel, the company said. It also
extended the contract of Management Board Member Bernhard Reutersberg until the end of his 62nd year in February 2016.  Birnbaum, expected to join in July, will oversee markets
and services, while Kildahl will be responsible for exploration
and production and business in  Russia  and outside  Europe . Winkel
will become chief human resources officer and be responsible for
conventional and renewables generation. Chief Financial Officer
Marcus Schenck’s current contract runs to the end of 2014.  EON is among European utilities battling weaker demand and
slower economies, at the same time that the company is dealing
with  Germany ’s plan to exit nuclear generation by 2022. EON,
which scrapped previous profit forecasts for 2013, plans to
reduce capital spending and is selling assets to cut costs.  The utility is also studying whether to close unprofitable
power plants. It will report its 2012 earnings tomorrow.  Stachelhaus leaves at the end of June due to illness in her
family and Maubach by the end of March “by mutual agreement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
