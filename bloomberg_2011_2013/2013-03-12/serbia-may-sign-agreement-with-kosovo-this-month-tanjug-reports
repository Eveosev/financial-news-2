Serbia  may sign an agreement with
 Kosovo  that would grant autonomy to mostly Serb municipalities
in the breakaway province on March 20 or 28,  Tanjug  newswire
reported, citing Serbiaâ€™s President Tomislav Nikolic.  The agreement will help improve relations with Kosovo,
which is a condition for Serbia to win a start date for European
Union entry talks. It became possible after Kosovo agreed during
EU-mediated talks to give the Serb minority some self-rule,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
