Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  declined as high inventories and property curbs
increased concern that demand may wane.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to 3,890  yuan  ($626) a
metric ton and traded at 3,901 yuan at 10:44 a.m. local time.  The China’s cabinet on March 1 introduced measures to tame
 home prices , including a 20 percent tax on individuals selling
properties. Jiangsu Shagang Group Co., China’s biggest non-
state-owned mill, cut prices for rebar products by 250 yuan to
3,800 yuan a ton after the State Council announced detailed
property curbs, Shanghai Securities News reported today.  “The main theme now in the rebar market is high inventory
and the government curb on property investment, which are
bearish for building material demand,” said Cai Yuehui, an
analyst at Ruida Futures Co. Cai said the market may be prone to
rebound with gains in the  U.S. dollar  spurring other metals such
as the copper.  The average spot price for rebar fell 0.2 percent to
3,753 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co. Iron ore for immediate
delivery fell 1.5 percent yesterday to $144.10 a ton, according
to data compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
