(Corrects date of Fitch downgrade in third paragraph.)  Italian borrowing costs rose today
in the first auction since  Fitch Ratings  downgraded the nation,
saying inconclusive elections threatened its ability to respond
to the fourth recession since 2001.  The Rome-based Treasury auctioned 7.75 billion euros ($10.1
billion) of one-year bills today at 1.28 percent, the highest
since December and up from 1.094 percent at an auction of
similar maturity debt Feb. 12. Attracted by higher rates,
investors bid for 1.50 times the amount offered, up from 1.38
times last month. Today’s sale was probably helped by 8.69
billion euros in bill redemptions this week.  Fitch lowered  Italy ’s credit rating one level to BBB+ on
March 8, saying inconclusive parliamentary elections in February
threatened the government’s ability to respond to a recession
and the  European debt crisis . Italy’s bonds have trailed their
Spanish counterparts since the parliamentary elections on Feb.
24-25 failed to produce a clear winner, threatening outgoing
Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s austerity program.  “The political stalemate, supply pressure and the recent
downgrade by Fitch continue to keep Italy in the spotlight,”
UniCredit strategist Elia Lattuga wrote in a note yesterday.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped 3 basis points to 4.6
percent after the sale at 11:08 a.m. in  Rome . Italy returns to
the market tomorrow with the sale of longer maturity bonds.  -- Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
