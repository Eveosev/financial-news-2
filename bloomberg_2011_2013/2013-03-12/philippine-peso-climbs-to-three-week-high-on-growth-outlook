The Philippine peso rose to a
three-week high on speculation the fastest pace of economic
growth in  Southeast Asia  will lure more overseas funds. Ten-year
bond yields dropped to the lowest level in at least 15 years.  The $225 billion economy has reached a level of stability
that will enable it to achieve 7 percent expansion, Anoop Singh,
director of the Asia & Pacific Department at the  International
Monetary Fund , said at a forum in Manila today. Gross domestic
product increased 6.6 percent in 2012, the most in two years,
and the government predicts growth of 6 percent to 7 percent in
2013.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 40.612 per dollar as of 2:02
p.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched
40.605 earlier, the highest level since Feb. 20. The median
estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for the
currency to breach 39 by year-end.  “Investors are still bullish on the Philippine story and
the consensus is for the peso to rise to the 39 level,” said
Toto Hilado, executive vice president at Rizal Commercial
Banking Corp. in  Manila . “We’re seeing more inflows into stocks
and other assets.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, was little changed
at 3.86 percent. The peso has appreciated 5.2 percent in the
past 12 months, the best performance among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Rate Decision  Net inflows  into the nation’s stocks and debt climbed to
$1.3 billion in January, almost six times the $213 million in
December, the central bank reported Feb. 14. The Philippine
Composite Index of equities reached a record high yesterday and
has rallied 17 percent this year.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas can’t rule out a further cut in
 interest rates  on special-deposit accounts, Governor Amando
Tetangco said today at the same forum. The government is closely
watching asset markets “prone to bubbly behavior,” he said,
citing the equity and property sectors. The government is
watching capital flows and is preparing for outflow risks,
Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima added.  Funds in the accounts rose to 1.9 trillion pesos ($45.7
billion) as of Feb. 15 from about 1.7 trillion pesos in January,
according to central bank data. The economy grew 6.6 percent in
2012.  Bangko Sentral will keep its benchmark overnight borrowing
rate at a record low 3.5 percent on March 14, according to all
16 economist estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  The central bank is moving to an “interest-rate corridor
approach,” Tetangco said today, referring to a band that will
give BSP greater policy flexibility. The reduction in the SDA
rate to 3 percent from more than 3.5 percent in January was an
“initial step” to a transition to a policy band, the governor
said last week.  The yield on the 13 percent bonds due February 2023 fell 16
basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 3.5 percent,
according to midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing &
Exchange Corp. That’s the lowest rate for a benchmark 10-year
note since Bloomberg started tracking the data in October 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
