Lithuania ’s Klaipeda State Seaport
Authority will get a 44 million-euro ($57 million) loan from the
Nordic Investment Bank to upgrade the Baltic port and boost its
cargo-handling capacity by a quarter.  “Modern, well-functioning infrastructure in Klaipeda
Seaport is of strategic importance for Lithuania’s economy,”
NIB President Henrik Normann said today in a  statement  on the
Helsinki-based lender’s website. “This investment will boost
the country’s competitiveness in trade logistics and promote the
capacity of transportation services in the region.”  Klaipeda is the northernmost ice-free port on the eastern
coast of the  Baltic Sea . The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development gave a separate loan in January for developing
container handling at the port to support “the transformation
of Klaipeda into a major regional transshipment hub.”  The NIB said its loan will be used to reconstruct quays,
build a pier for ferries as well as deepen and widen the port’s
navigation channel. The projects will increase annual capacity
by as much as 13 tons and make Klaipeda safer for ships,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
