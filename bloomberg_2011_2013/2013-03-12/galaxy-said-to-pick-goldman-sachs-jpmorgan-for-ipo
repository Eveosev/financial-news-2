China  Galaxy Securities Co., a
brokerage backed by China’s sovereign wealth fund, picked
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to help manage
its initial public offering in Hong Kong, two people with
knowledge of the matter said.  The Beijing-based firm may raise as much as $1.5 billion in
the second quarter, said the people, asking not to be identified
because the information is private. The two New York-based
banks, along with Galaxy Securities’s Hong Kong unit, will act
as sponsors and global coordinators for the offering, they said.  Central Huijin Investment Ltd., a unit of China Investment
Corp., owned 79 percent of Galaxy Securities at the end of 2011,
according to Huijin’s website.  Galaxy Securities has shortlisted more than 10 other banks
to help arrange the sale and their roles are yet to be decided,
the people said. The brokerage was forced to put on hold its
Shanghai listing plan after Chinese regulators suspended IPO
approvals, they said.  IFR reported earlier today that China Galaxy picked 16
banks for the offering. An external spokeswoman for Galaxy
Securities declined to comment on the IPO plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
