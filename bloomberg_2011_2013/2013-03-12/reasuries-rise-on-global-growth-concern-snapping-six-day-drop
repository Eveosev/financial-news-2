Treasuries rose for the first time
in seven days as yields at almost the highest levels in 11
months attracted investors before the first of three sales this
week of notes and bonds totaling $66 billion.  Benchmark  10-year note  yields dropped earlier after data
showing U.K. industrial production unexpectedly fell in January
reignited concern global growth will slow. The U.S. is scheduled
to sell $32 billion in three-year notes today, $21 billion of
10-year debt tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year securities on
March 14. Yields surged last week as stronger-than-forecast jobs
data increased optimism that the U.S. economy is gathering pace.  “These are semi-attractive levels,” said Justin Lederer,
an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York,
one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve.
“The U.S. is not ready to break significantly higher in yields.
The three-year will go fine. There are just buyers out there.”  Treasury 10-year  yields  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.02 percent at 12:17 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They climbed to 2.08
percent on March 8, the highest level since April 5, and touched
2.07 percent earlier today. The price of the 2 percent note
maturing in February 2023 gained 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 26/32.  Thirty-year bond  yields  decreased four basis points to 3.22
percent. They reached 3.28 percent on March 8, also the highest
since April 5.  Global Peers  Treasuries due in 10 years and more are trading at the
cheapest level in 19 months relative to global peers with
similar maturities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.
Yields on the Treasuries were 53 basis points higher yesterday
than those in an index of other sovereign debt due in 10 years
and more, the indexes show. That was the most since August 2011.  “It represents value against other fixed-income markets,”
said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading
in New York at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World
Markets unit. “We continue to cheapen up against those. We have
not been narrowing to them over the course of the last few
sessions.”  The three-year notes being sold today yielded 0.41 percent
in pre-auction trading, versus 0.411 percent at the prior sale
on Feb. 12.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their orders with the Treasury, purchased a record amount of
three-year debt for the third straight month at the February
sale. They snapped up 26.9 percent of the securities, topping
the previous record of 26.4 percent at the January offering.  Record Low  Indirect bidders , the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 18 percent of the notes, a record low.  The Feb. 12 auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of notes offered,
was 3.59, versus 3.62 at the previous auction and a record high
of 3.96 at the October sale.  U.K. production fell 1.2 percent from December, when it
rose 1.1 percent, the Office for National Statistics said today
in London. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 29
economists was for a 0.1 percent increase. Manufacturing output
also declined, falling 1.5 percent.  Global stocks fluctuated, and the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index dropped as much as 0.5 percent.  Data ‘Disappointment’  “There’s a little bit of disappointment about the economic
figures around the globe, and that’s supportive of Treasuries,”
said Ralf Umlauf, head of floor research at Landesbank Hessen-
Thueringen in Frankfurt. “We are seeing weaker equity markets
as well as bad figures from U.K. industrial production. In the
medium-term, yields should rise because the U.S. will show
moderate growth.”  U.S. retail  sales  advanced in February for a fourth month,
rising 0.5 percent, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce
Department reports the figure tomorrow.  Government data on March 8 showed the U.S. economy gained
236,000 jobs in February, versus 165,000 projected by a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. The unemployment rate
unexpectedly fell to 7.7 percent, from 7.9 percent.  The Fed is purchasing $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage
debt each month under the quantitative-easing stimulus strategy
to fuel growth by putting downward pressure on yields. The
central bank bought $1.38 billion today of Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities maturing from April 2028 to February 2043.  Fed policy makers’ next meeting is on March 19-20.  Treasuries trading  volume  dropped yesterday to $185
billion, the least since touching a 2013 low of $183 billion on
March 4, according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker
of U.S. government debt. Volume increased to $384 billion on
March 8, the highest since Feb. 26. Average daily Treasuries
volume for the past year is $248 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
