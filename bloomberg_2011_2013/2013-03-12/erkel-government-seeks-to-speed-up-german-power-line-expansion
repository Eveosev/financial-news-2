Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government wants to speed up the modernization of Germany’s
power grid to protect supplies as  Europe ’s biggest economy
shifts its generation mix away from nuclear energy.  The government identified 36 high-voltage power-
transmission projects costing an estimated 10 billion euros ($13
billion) as “high-priority” in a  draft bill  to be debated
March 14 in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament.  “The swift expansion of renewable energies, the gradual
shutdown of the remaining nuclear power plants and the
construction of fossil-fired stations at new locations require
power to be transmitted across large distances,” according to
the bill. “Especially power from wind farms and new
conventional plants in northern Germany must be shipped to
consumer hot spots in the south and west.”  Germany, which plans to shutter its atomic reactors by
2022, depends on networks in neighboring Poland, France and the
 Czech Republic  to reroute power from its wind farms in the north
to the southwest, the nation’s biggest manufacturing region,
where Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and chemical maker  BASF SE (BAS)  run
factories. The Czech government last year complained it was
close to a blackout because the German wind farms overloaded its
grid.  German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler, who will speak on
the issue in this week’s debate, said last week that the
government wants to speed up planning for  power lines  to four
years on average from the current 10 years.  Germany’s Federal Administrative Court would handle any
legal cases arising from the power line developments, a measure
to speed up the projects. Previously lawsuits could be brought
in local or regional courts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
