The rand weakened to the lowest
level in almost four years against the dollar after  South Africa 
posted a current-account shortfall wider than analysts’
estimates in the fourth quarter.  The currency depreciated as much as 1.3 percent to 9.2122
per dollar, the lowest since April 15, 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rand traded 0.5 percent weaker at
9.1329 by 3:55 p.m. in Johannesburg, bringing its slide this
year to 7.2 percent, the most among more than 20 emerging-market
peers monitored by Bloomberg. Yields on the benchmark 10.5
percent bonds due December 2026 dropped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 7.38 percent.  The  current-account deficit  narrowed to 6.5 percent of
gross domestic product, according to central bank data. That
compares with a 6.3 percent median estimate of 10 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The gap for the third quarter was revised to
6.8 percent of GDP from 6.4 percent.  “It is a bit of a shocker for the rand,” Mohammed Nalla,
head of strategic research at  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  in
Johannesburg, said by phone. “The worry is that the previous
number was revised upwards. That’s a very large negative.”  The deficit, the broadest measure of trade in goods and
services, almost doubled to 6.3 percent in 2012 from 3.4 percent
a year earlier as mining strikes and slower growth in  Europe  cut
exports. South Africa’s monthly trade deficit jumped to a record
in January as mining production declined in the wake of labor
disputes.  Foreign Inflows  Mining  output , which accounts for 53 percent of the
nation’s exports, probably fell 4.2 percent in the year through
January, a report to be released on March 14 may show. Strikes
have halted output at five mines of  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) , the
nation’s second-biggest coal producer.  South Africa relies mainly on foreign investment in stocks
and bonds to fund the deficit. Foreign portfolio inflows dropped
to 12.5 billion rand in the last quarter from 27.5 billion rand
in the previous three months, the central bank said.  The current-account shortfall “highlights the very poor
savings rate and the continuing need for capital inflows,”
Arthur Kamp, chief economist at Cape Town-based Sanlam
Investment Management, said by phone. “That’s reflected in a
weaker currency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
