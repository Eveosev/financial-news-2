China’s benchmark money-market rate
rose for a second day on speculation investors are raising funds
to subscribe for a bond sale by China Minsheng Banking Corp.  The nation’s first privately owned bank has approval from
the China Securities Regulatory Commission to sell 20 billion
 yuan  ($3.2 billion) of convertible bonds, according to a Feb. 8
statement to the stock exchange. The sale may lock up about 400
billion yuan of capital, according to Sealand Securities Co.  “A lot of institutions have started borrowing money,
preparing to buy the Minsheng convertibles, which is helping
push up the seven-day repo rate,” said Chen Ying, a bond
analyst in Shenzhen at Sealand Securities Co.  The  seven-day repurchase rate , which measures funding
availability on the  interbank market , increased six basis points
to 3.05 percent in Shanghai, according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The People’s Bank of China will conduct 26 billion yuan of
28-day repurchase operations today, according to a trader at a
primary dealer required to bid at the auctions.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.26 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
