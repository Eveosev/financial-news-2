Investors who bought  SNS Reaal NV (SR) 
bonds in the three days before the Dutch government took control
of the lender can’t cancel the trades and are now creditors of
the state, a government official said.  Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem nationalized SNS
at 8:30 a.m. on Feb. 1, seizing its stock and subordinated
bonds, after losses on real estate loans brought the firm to the
brink of collapse. Trades done after the morning of Jan. 29
hadn’t settled by the time of the takeover, and those buyers are
left with a claim on any redress, said the official, who
declined to be identified because the transactions are private.  Buyers of the SNS subordinated bonds that the government
seized are now the owners of a security identification number
that gives them the right to compensation. Dijsselbloem said
March 4 they won’t get anything back because a liquidation of
the bank wouldn’t have generated enough to pay senior debt
investors, let alone junior note holders.  Bondholders who suffered losses can submit their objections
to the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal,
which will rule on Dijsselbloem’s decision to set compensation
at zero.  To contact the reporter on this story:
