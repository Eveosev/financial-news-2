Journalists working for closely
held media in  Mali  went on a nationwide strike today to demand
the release of an editor who was arrested by the army last week.  Boucary Daou, manager of Le Republicain, a daily newspaper,
was detained on March 6 for publishing a letter criticizing
Captain Amadou Sanogo, the leader of last year’s military coup,
according to an e-mailed statement from Maison de la Presse, a
media organization based in Bamako, the capital.  Daou’s detention comes after  a series of arbitrary arrests 
and beatings of journalists in the impoverished West African
nation since the March 2012 coup and the takeover of northern
Mali by Islamist insurgents, according to the New York-based
Committee to Protect Journalists. A radio broadcaster in the
central town of Niono was attacked with a knife earlier this
month, the group said in a statement yesterday.  The letter in Le Republicain was signed by officers in the
Malian army saying it’s unfair Sanogo will receive a monthly
salary of at least 4 million  CFA francs  ($7,900) as head of a
military committee in charge of defense reform, according to
Maison de la Presse. Sanogo, who ousted President Amadou Toumani
Toure in the coup, was appointed to the position last month.  Army spokesman Modibo Traore didn’t answer a call made to
his mobile phone today.  France  intervened in Mali on Jan. 11 to help the interim
government restore state control over the north, which was run
by Islamist rebels seeking to impose Shariah law in the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
