Chinese stocks  fell the most in a
month in  New York , as  Perfect World  Co. sank after forecasting
sales below analysts’ estimates while  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) 
slid amid debt restructuring and plans to close a U.S. plant.  The Bloomberg  China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. slipped 1.7 percent to 93.06
yesterday, the steepest slide since Feb. 7. Online games
developer Perfect World plunged the most since April 2012 and
Suntech slumped to a three-month low. Qihoo 360 Technology Ltd.
dropped as U.S. regulators queried its 2011 earnings report.  Citigroup Inc. and BOC International Holdings Inc.
downgraded Perfect World after the Beijing-based company
predicted lower first-quarter sales than analysts estimated.
Suntech said it plans to stop production at its  Arizona  solar-
panel manufacturing facility next month.  China’s economy , the
world’s second-largest, emerged from a seven-quarter slowdown in
the last three months of 2012.  “Most companies haven’t given us a strong outlook for the
first quarter, as a recovery in corporate operations is lagging
behind a recovery in the macroeconomy,” Tian X. Hou, the
founder of T.H. Capital LLC, said in a telephone interview from
Beijing yesterday. “Perfect World’s fourth-quarter results were
the worst among major Chinese web gamers as it lacks new games
to drive growth.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., slid 1.7 percent to $37.98,
the biggest decline in a week. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
retreated for the first time in eight days, falling 0.2 percent
to 1,552.48. Thirty-day  volatility  on the China-US gauge climbed
to a one-month high of 16 yesterday.  Sales Forecast  Perfect World’s American depositary receipts plunged 8.8
percent to $10.52, the lowest level in three months. Its ADRs
have lost 1.5 percent in 2013, compared with a 27 percent jump
in  NetEase Inc. (NTES) ,  China ’s second-largest web games operator, and
a 20 percent gain in  Giant Interactive Group Inc. (GA)   Perfect World projected first-quarter sales to be between
592 million yuan ($95.2 million) to 619 million yuan in a
statement on March 11, below the 642.8 million yuan average
estimate of three analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Its fourth-
quarter net income of 1.78  yuan  per ADR was also below the mean
estimate of 2.5 yuan.  Citigroup cut Perfect World to neutral from buy and lowered
its price target by 30 percent to $13.2 in a note yesterday. BOC
International also lowered its recommendation to hold, the
equivalent of neutral, and Barclays Plc reduced the price goal
to $12.3 from $13.5.  Qihoo Retreats  Qihoo, which owns the most-used web browser in China and
provides online security and search services, dropped 1.5
percent to $31.34, the lowest close this month.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked Qihoo in
a Sept. 17 letter to explain details of its 2011 annual report,
according to documents published yesterday.  Guangshen Railway Co. (GSH) , which runs the only train line
linking mainland China to  Hong Kong , sank 5.4 percent to $24.9,
the biggest loss in a month.  China’s Ministry of Railways will be split into two,
according to a March 10 report to the National People’s
Congress. Some functions will be put into a State Railway
Administration under the Ministry of Transportation. A new
company, China Railway Corp., will take over commercial
operations, according to the plan.  Reforms announced are market-oriented and favor
competition, Vivian Liu, an analyst at SinoPac Securities Asia
Ltd., said in phone interview yesterday from Shanghai. Railway
companies that had enjoyed a degree of government support may be
affected, she said.  Production Stop  Suntech tumbled 5.2 percent to $1.09, the lowest price
since Dec. 18. The company, based in Wuxi of China’s Jiangsu
province, said yesterday it plans to stop its Goodyear, Arizona,
facility in April. Higher production costs, as well as U.S.
import tariffs on solar cells and aluminum frames contributed to
the decision to close the factory, it said.  Five Wall Street investment and hedge funds have the most
to lose as the company seeks more time to repay $541 million of
convertible debt.  Mongolian Mining Corp. (975) , the nation’s biggest coking coal
exporter, swung to a full-year loss of $2.5 million in 2012
after prices declined because of slowing demand in China, its
main market. That compared with a profit of $119.1 million a
year earlier, the Ulan Bator-based company, known as MMC, said
yesterday in a statement.  MMC’s dollar bonds due in 2017 fell 2.84 cents on the
dollar, the most since the securities were issued in March 2012,
to 102.12 cents in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Yields rose 82 basis points, or 0.82 percentage
point, to 8.25 percent.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  dropped 1.3 percent
to 11,292.14 yesterday, while the Shanghai Composite Index of
domestic Chinese shares slipped 1 percent to 2,286.61, sinking
for a fourth day in the longest losing stretch since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
