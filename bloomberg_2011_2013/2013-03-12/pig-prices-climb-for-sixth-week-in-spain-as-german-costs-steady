Pig prices rose for a sixth
straight week in  Spain  and  France  while prices were steady in
 Germany , the European Union’s biggest pork producer, industry
group Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter Deutschlands
e.V. reported.  Prices climbed to 1.818 euros a kilogram ($1.08 a pound) in
Spain and 1.64 euros a kilogram in France, Damme, Germany-based
ISN wrote in an online  report  today. The countries are the EU’s
second- and third-largest pork producers. Hog weights in Spain
have reached the lowest in five years as demand outpaced supply,
according to the report.  “Spain remains the market leader, still continuing the
upward trend,” ISN wrote. “In France, there is complaint about
weak demand for meat resulting from low domestic consumption,
although prices are rising.”  In Germany, pig prices were unchanged for a third week at
1.626 euros a kilogram as “extensive quantities” of pigs
available for processing were counteracted by “exceptionally
brisk buying interest,” according to the report.  Dutch, Belgian, Austrian and Irish pig prices were also
unchanged from the previous week, while prices advanced in the
U.K. and declined in Denmark and Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
