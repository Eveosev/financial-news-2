Mongolian Mining Corp. (975) , the
nation’s biggest coking coal exporter, swung to a full-year loss
in 2012 after slowing demand in  China , its main market, hit coal
prices.  MMC’s average selling price for its washed hard coking
coal, used by steelmakers, fell 30 percent to $108 a metric ton,
even as it sold 17 percent more coal. The net loss was $2.5
million in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit
of $119.1 million a year earlier, the Ulan Bator-based company
said today in a statement. Revenue dropped 13 percent to $474.5
million.  “The apparent consumption of coking coal in China has
fallen in line with the slower growth of steel production and
the de-stocking and reduction of inventory levels by coke and
steel producers,” the company said.  MMC, which accounted for about 27 percent of the nation’s
coal exports, said inventories in China had returned to normal
levels from the fourth quarter of 2012, and “re-stocking
activities are expected to positively influence coking coal
prices in the short-term.”  The stock lost 4.7 percent to HK$3.06 as of 11:07 a.m. in
 Hong Kong , compared with the 0.2 percent gain in the benchmark
 Hang Seng  index. It has slumped 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
