Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor nominee
Haruhiko Kuroda may face the need for two rounds of confirmation
votes in Parliament after the largest opposition party said
he’ll need to be proposed again for a full term.  The Democratic Party of  Japan  said that while it supports
Kuroda, the Asian Development Bank president, to serve the
remainder of outgoing Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa ’s tenure from
March 19 to April 8, another nomination will be needed for the
full five-year term starting next month. Shirakawa in February
announced he would be leaving almost three weeks early.  “Kuroda didn’t explain to my satisfaction how he will
realize” the 2 percent inflation target at yesterday’s hearing,
DPJ party policy chief Mitsuru Sakurai said in press conference
today. “We want him to come back to parliament again and
discuss his views.”  The comments add to potential hurdles for Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe to put in place his desired central bank leadership
team. The DPJ also said it would oppose Kikuo Iwata for one of
the two BOJ deputy governor slots, while supporting Hiroshi Nakaso.  Abe needs opposition support to get his BOJ candidates
through the upper house of parliament, where his Liberal
Democratic Party lacks a majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
