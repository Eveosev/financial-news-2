Gold’s worst start to a year in a
quarter century and the biggest sales by investors on record are
increasing concern that bullion’s longest rally since the end of
World War I is ending.  Investors sold 106.2 metric tons valued at $5.4 billion
from  exchange-traded products  in February, the most since their
creation in 2003, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Another 26.1
tons was cut since then. Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc
say the 12-year rally will peak in 2013 and billionaire  George Soros  reduced his stake in the biggest ETP by 55 percent in the
last quarter. Prices are within 5 percent of a  bear market  after
the longest run of monthly losses since 1997.  Hedge funds  are now their least bullish since 2007 as
economies accelerate and Federal Reserve policy makers review
stimulus. Bullion as much as doubled after central banks, led by
the Fed, started buying more than $3.5 trillion of debt from
December 2008 to restore growth. With global equities at a four-
year high and the dollar near its strongest in seven months,
eight of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg said they expect
lower average  gold prices  in 2014 than this year.  “There is a belief that the world economy is improving,”
said John Toohey, a  San Antonio , Texas-based vice president of
equity investments at USAA Investments, which manages more than
$54 billion of assets. “We are especially seeing the signs in
U.S. and that may at some point lead to higher  interest rates .
It seems as if the fast money is moving out of gold.”  Worst Start  Gold slid 5.6 percent to $1,581.55 an ounce in  London  this
year by yesterday’s close, the worst start since 1988. It traded
at $1,595.71 today and averaged a record $1,669 last year. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities rose 1.1 percent
since the start of January and the MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWD) 
of equities gained 6.4 percent. Treasuries lost 1.1 percent, a
Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reduced its three-month forecast
by 12 percent to $1,615 on Feb. 25 and expects $1,550 in a year.
Gold is “significantly overvalued” and unlikely to return to
its September 2011 record of $1,921.15, Credit Suisse said Feb.
1. The bank, along with Barclays Plc, Societe Generale SA,
Natixis SA, BNP Paribas SA, ABN Amro Bank NV, Danske Bank A/S
and TD Securities Inc., is predicting lower average prices next
year than in 2013.  About $6.8 trillion was added to the value of global
equities since November as  China  accelerated for the first time
in two years. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect U.S.
growth to gain every quarter this year and the  International
Monetary Fund  predicts global expansion will climb to 3.5
percent in 2013 from 3.2 percent in 2012. U.S. unemployment fell
to a four-year low of 7.7 percent last month, as job growth
surged from automakers to builders to retailers.  ‘Asset Bubble’  Soros Fund Management LLC, founded by the 82-year-old who
called bullion the “ultimate asset bubble” in 2010, owned
about $97 million of metal through the SPDR Gold Trust as of
Dec. 31, a regulatory filing showed last month. Louis Moore Bacon’s Moore Capital Management LP sold its stake in the SPDR
fund, valued then at $16 million, and cut holdings in the Sprott
Physical Gold Trust by 53 percent to $12.1 million in the fourth
quarter. Spokesmen for both investors declined to comment.  John Paulson , the largest SPDR investor, kept his holding
unchanged last quarter, his filing showed. The stake is now
valued at $3.4 billion. New York-based Paulson & Co.’s investors
can choose between gold-and dollar-denominated versions of most
of its funds. The 57-year-old told clients March 6 that his Gold
Fund fell 26 percent this year. Stefan Prelog, a spokesman,
declined to comment.  Mario Draghi  Central bank asset buying won’t end any time soon and
concern about currency debasement combined with rising
expectations for inflation will spur demand for gold, Morgan
Stanley said in a Feb. 25 report. The median estimate of the 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for a record annual average of
$1,700 in 2013, falling to $1,638 in 2014.  Bank of Japan Governor-designate Haruhiko Kuroda said last
week the central bank should bring forward open-ended asset
purchases scheduled to start next year. European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said March 7 that officials discussed
cutting borrowing costs further. Gold usually earns returns only
through price gains, increasing its allure at a time of record-
low interest rates.  “Just because it feels that the economy is improving does
not necessarily mean that is actually happening,” said  Michael Cuggino , who manages $17 billion of assets at Permanent
Portfolio Family of Funds Inc. in  San Francisco . “We could
continue to see governments trying to boost growth.”  Gold Council  Bullion isn’t declining for all investors, amid mounting
rhetoric over currency wars. Gold priced in yen rose 5.7 percent
this year and in British pounds advanced 4.1 percent.  Central banks added 534.6 tons to reserves last year, the
most since 1964, in part to diversify their currency holdings,
according to the London-based World Gold Council. Barclays
forecasts 300 tons of buying in 2013 and the same in 2014. Lower
prices and improving economies may boost jewelry purchases, the
biggest source of demand, with the bank predicting a 3.2 percent
gain this year, from an 8.2 percent drop in 2012.  The slump in gold is curbing profit for those extracting
the metal, in some cases from as deep as 2.4 miles underground.
As bullion almost quadrupled since 2003, mining costs jumped
more than fivefold, data compiled by New York-based Kenneth Hoffman and other analysts at Bloomberg Industries show. For as
many as 11 of the world’s biggest miners, production costs
averaged $991 an ounce in the first nine months of 2012.  Future Production  The 30-member Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver
Index, including  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) , fell 17
percent this year, extending retreats of 8.3 percent in 2012 and
20 percent in 2011. Mining companies have so far held off
locking in prices by selling future production, with Barclays
anticipating net hedging of 20 tons this year and 35 tons in
2014. Annual production is about 2,700 tons.  Options traders are increasing bets on more declines. Puts
that profit should the  SPDR Gold Trust (GLD)  fall 10 percent  cost  2.1
points more than calls betting on a 10 percent rally, according
to three-month options data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
relationship known as skew reached a record 3.3 points Feb. 21.
Combined ETP holdings stand at 2,479.9 tons, from a peak of
2,632.5 tons in December.  Hedge funds  are 84 percent less bullish on gold than they
were the month before prices reached a record in September 2011.
Speculators held a net-long position of 39,631 futures and
options in the week ended March 5, the fewest since July 2007,
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.  The  U.S. Mint  sold 753,000 ounces of American Eagle gold
coins last year, 25 percent less than in 2011, data on its
website show. Coin and bar sales from Australia’s Perth Mint
fell 17 percent last year, the company said March 6.  “People are seeing less need for gold,” said Michael Mullaney, the chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust in
 Boston , which manages $9.5 billion of assets. “The end of loose
 money supply  is making gold less attractive.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
