Peru ’s sol depreciated for the
first time in four days after the central bank bought dollars to
stem gains in the local currency.  The sol fell 0.1 percent to 2.5960 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, according to Datatec data. The currency has slid
1.7 percent this year after gaining 5.4 percent in 2012.  The central bank bought $90 million, the most in three
weeks, as companies paying local income tax led the sol to
appreciate as much as 0.3 percent intraday. The monetary
authority has purchased $3.5 billion this year and raised
 reserve requirements  three times to contain the sol.  “The extended tax period will keep the currency under
pressure to appreciate,” though the pace will probably be
moderate, said  Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank Peru
SA. “The central bank won’t allow wide fluctuations in the
currency.”  Companies have until March 21 to make monthly tax payments
and until early April to meet their obligations for the 2012 tax
year, according to the website of Peru’s tax collection agency,
Sunat.  The central bank said on its website it issued 150 million
soles in certificates of deposit today with maturities as long
as one year. After buying dollars the monetary authority issues
the securities to absorb the extra soles from the market through
a process known as sterilization.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due in August 2020 increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.83 percent at 3:27 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.14
centimo to 125.53 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
