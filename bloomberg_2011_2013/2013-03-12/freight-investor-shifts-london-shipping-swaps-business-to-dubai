Freight Investor Services Ltd., a
brokerage of shipping and iron-ore derivatives, said itâ€™s
shifting most of its London-based dry-cargo business to Dubai.  Staff will relocate from April 2, Freight Investor said in
an e-mailed statement today. The move will help meet Asian
demand for the contracts, the brokerage said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
