Colombia ’s peso bond yields fell to
a record low on speculation policy makers will reduce borrowing
costs next week to buoy growth in the Andean economy.  Yields on peso debt due May 2014, the benchmark for bonds
with shorter maturities, fell one basis point, or one percentage
point, to 3.82 percent at 9:34 a.m. in Bogota. The yields are at
the lowest since the securities were issued in 2009.  “The market is focused on what will happen in next week’s
central bank meeting,” Eduardo Bolanos, an analyst at Asesores
en Valores brokerage in Bogota, said in a phone interview.  Banco de la Republica will lower the overnight lending rate
a quarter percentage point to 3.5 percent at the March 22
meeting, according to the majority of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The central bank has cut its policy  rate  six times
beginning in July to 3.75 percent, the lowest level among major
Latin American economies.  Colombia’s economy has no inflationary pressure in the near
future, as excess capacity helps keeps prices down, the central
bank said March 8 in the minutes of its February meeting. Annual
inflation decelerated in February to 1.83 percent, the slowest
since 1955 and below the bank’s target range of 2 percent to 4
percent.  Policy makers also cited “paralysis” in the country’s
coal industry and the risk of lower demand from  Venezuela  in its
unanimous decision to cut the key rate last month.  The peso was little changed at 1,802.05 per  U.S. dollar .
It’s down 1.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
