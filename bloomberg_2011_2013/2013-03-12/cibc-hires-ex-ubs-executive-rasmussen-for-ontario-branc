Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce 
hired former  UBS AG (UBSN)  executive Grant Rasmussen to help oversee

head, Ontario for CIBC retail distribution, Kevin Dove, a
spokesman for the Toronto-based firm, said today. CIBC’s Ontario

management unit as president and chief executive officer, and as
a former CEO of Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Direct Investing
