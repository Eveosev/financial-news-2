Chilean economists forecast a
faster pace of monetary tightening than they did a month ago as
they increased their economic growth estimates.  Policy makers will keep the key rate unchanged at today’s 5
percent through the end of 2013 before raising it a half-point
within 23 months, according to a monthly survey posted on the
central bank website today. Analysts last month forecast only a
quarter-point increase over that time frame.  Since the last survey was conducted on Feb. 11, economic
growth data exceeded estimates made by analysts even as
inflation slowed to 1.3 percent from 1.6 percent in January.
While the inflation rate will increase in 11 months to 3
percent, it won’t exceed the bank’s target range of 2 percent to
4 percent for the coming 23 months, according to the poll.  Gross domestic product will rise 5 percent in 2013,
analysts said in today’s survey, increasing their previous
forecast of 4.9 percent growth. The Imacec index, a proxy for
GDP, climbed 6.7 percent in January from last year, beating by
more than 1 percentage point estimates in the February central
bank survey.  The peso, which has gained 0.5 percent against the U.S.
dollar in the past three months, fell 0.1 percent to 472.23 per
dollar at 8:36 a.m. local time. The peso will trade at 475 in
two months, according to the median estimate of 55 analysts in
today’s poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
