Cyfrowy Polsat SA (CPS)  climbed from a
two-week low in Warsaw trading on speculation  Poland ’s largest
television network may restart paying a dividend this year after
fourth-quarter earnings exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  rose 6.1 percent to 17.3 zloty at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Warsaw, the biggest gain since Dec. 11. The stock has
increased 5.4 percent this year, while the benchmark WIG20 Index
lost 3.9 percent.  Net income rose 59 percent to 121.6 million zloty ($38
million) on a “positive effect” of bond revaluation and lower
debt-servicing costs, the Warsaw-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. That exceeded the 99.1 million zloty
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 12 analysts.  “The fourth-quarter numbers are very decent,” Piotr Janik, an analyst at KBC Securities in Warsaw, said in a note
today. “We see room for a hefty dividend payment in 2013”
after Cyfrowy’s net debt fell to less than twice earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Cyfrowy, controlled by billionaire Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, last
paid a dividend in 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company could “theoretically” pay a dividend
from 2012 profit and will decide on a payout after the first
quarter, Chief Executive Officer Dominik Libicki said on Nov.
14.  The company plans to keep its net debt at less than twice
its Ebitda this year even as it forecasts the Polish television
ad market to shrink 4 percent to 6 percent in 2013, the
broadcaster said in a presentation on its website today.  Cyfrowy, which offers services including satellite
television broadcasting, mobile phone operations and wireless
 Internet access , increased the number of its pay-TV unit
subscribers by 14,000 to 3.57 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
