Charge-offs on U.S. retail credit
cards reached a six-year low in February as payment rates
improved, according to Fitch Ratings.  The rating companyâ€™s Prime Credit Card Chargeoff Index,
dropped 30 basis points to 3.88 percent after increasing in
January. Charge-offs occur when issuers give up trying to
collect payment on delinquent accounts.  Monthly payment rates, the pace at which cardholders repay
outstanding balances, climbed to a lifetime high of 24.83
percent, the company said. The increase is a sign of consumer
prudence according to Michael Dean, managing director at Fitch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
