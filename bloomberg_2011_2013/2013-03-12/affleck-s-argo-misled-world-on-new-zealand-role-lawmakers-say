New Zealand’s parliament criticized
Hollywood director and actor Ben Affleck’s portrayal of the
nation’s role with respect to fleeing American hostages in the
Oscar-winning film "Argo."  Lawmakers passed a motion today “expressing regret” that
"Argo" depicted New Zealand as unhelpful to U.S. Embassy workers
in the 1979  Iran  hostage crisis. The motion, put forward by New
Zealand First leader Winston Peters, said the film misled the
world, and the nation deserved a correct factual record.  “In reality, our courageous New Zealand diplomats’
inspirational actions were of significant help to the American
hostages,” Peters said in the Wellington sitting.  Affleck directed and starred in "Argo," which depicts the
rescue of six U.S. Embassy workers during the Iranian
revolution. The film suggests that the New Zealand and Britain
embassies in Iran turned away the hostages before Canada gave
them shelter. It won Best Picture at this year’s Academy Awards.  Affleck had “struggled” with New Zealand and Britain’s
portrayal, saying it wasn’t “totally fair,” the New Zealand
Herald  reported  him as saying in an interview last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
