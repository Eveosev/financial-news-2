Clover Industries Ltd. (CLR) ,  South
Africa ’s biggest dairy processor, slid the most in more than a
month in Johannesburg trading after reporting a 34 percent drop
in first-half earnings.  Clover  fell  as much as 4.3 percent, the steepest intraday
decline since Feb. 1, and traded 3.2 percent lower at 16.36 rand
as of 11:14 a.m. local time. Earnings excluding one-time items
retreated 34 percent to 38 cents a share in the six months
through December, Clover said in a statement. Sales rose 11
percent to 3.98 billion rand ($436 million).  Clover is seeking to restore earnings growth after profit
was dragged down by higher costs for fuel and marketing. The
Johannesburg-based company is counting on its so-called cold
chain, the largest in South  Africa , to drive profit.  The company began distribution of Red Bull GmbH’s energy
drinks on March 1 and will start to sell Enterprise Foods Pty
Ltd. products in June, Chief Executive Officer Johann Vorster
said by telephone. The company’s cold-distribution business is
one of its “strongest points,” he said.  Fresh milk consumption in Africa’s largest economy
contracted 3.1 percent in 2012, while demand for long-life milk
grew 7.5 percent, according to Clover.  Clover has lost 6.6 percent this year compared with a 1
percent decline in the  10-member (JFPPS)  FTSE/JSE Africa Food Producers
and Processors Index, making it the second-worst performer after
