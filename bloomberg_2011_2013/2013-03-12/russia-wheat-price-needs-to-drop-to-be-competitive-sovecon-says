Russia, the world’s third-biggest
 wheat supplier  last season, risks losing global business in the
2013-14 season that starts July 1 unless the country’s domestic
prices fall at least 29 percent, SovEcon said.  If domestic prices don’t decline to a level of $250 a
metric ton or lower in the season 2013-14, Russian wheat may not
be competitive, Andrey Sizov Jr., managing director of SovEcon
consultancy, said by phone in Moscow today.  The domestic wheat price in Russia’s Southern federal
district, the country’s main exporting area, is slightly above
$350 a ton, Sizov said. That compares with $265 to $275 a ton
for exporters on a free-on-board basis at ports there, he said.  “It is unclear if prices will fall that much though,”
Sizov said, referring to domestic prices.  Prices advanced in Russia this season after drought in 2012
seared the grain crop, cutting it by 25 percent year-on-year to
70.7 million tons.  Wheat for May delivery traded at $6.9675 a bushel,
or $256 a ton, on the Chicago Board of Trade by 4:03 p.m. Moscow
time.  Reaping of the new crop in Russia is expected to begin in
June or July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
