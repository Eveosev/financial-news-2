Spain ’s government bonds rose for a
10th day and the nation’s borrowing costs fell at a bill sale
amid optimism the  European Central Bank  will limit volatility
caused by a political stalemate in Italy.  The country’s 10-year  securities  extended their winning
streak to the longest since August 2005 after Economy Minister
Luis De Guindos said yesterday he expected the economy to return
to growth by year-end. German bunds rose for a second day as
U.K. industrial output unexpectedly declined, boosting demand
for safer assets. French and Austrian securities also gained.
The ECB said in September it would buy the bonds of European
nations that request aid providing certain conditions are met.  “We have the ECB backstop and without it we’d be in a more
volatile situation,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
 London . “At the same time we have event risk in terms of the
political level and we also have economic risk and that’s
supportive of the bund and core markets in general.”  Spain’s  10-year yield  dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.72 percent at 4:31 p.m. London time after
falling to 4.70 percent, the lowest since November 2010. The 5.4
percent bond due in January 2023 rose 0.29, or 2.90 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,303) face amount, to 105.23.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 5.83 billion euros of six-
and 12-month bills, beating its target of 5.5 billion euros. It
auctioned the six-month securities at an average yield of 0.794
percent, down from 0.859 percent on Feb. 12. The 12-month bills
were allotted at 1.363 percent, versus 1.548 percent.  Spanish housing transactions climbed 18.9 percent in
January from a year earlier, a government report showed today.  ‘Pretty Strong’  “Spain is looking pretty strong,” said Allan von Mehren,
chief analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “The underlying
sentiment is positive and that’s having an impact on Spain.
Italy is finding it more difficult.”  German bunds led gains among the securities of so-called
core nations after the U.K. government said industrial
production slid 1.2 percent from December. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.1 percent increase.  The 10-year bund yield dropped four basis points to 1.48
percent after falling to a record 1.13 percent on June 1.  The yield on  French 10-year bonds  declined two basis points
to 2.11 percent and that on  Austrian securities  fell one basis
points to 1.76 percent.  German Borrowing  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s federal government will
reduce its net borrowing requirement in 2014 to the lowest in 40
years, allowing it to fulfill  Europe ’s fiscal compact targets
early, a draft plan shows.  Net new federal borrowing, the sum of credit used to plug a
budget spending gap, will drop to 6.4 billion euros, half of an
earlier target, according to the budget draft that will be put
to the Cabinet in Berlin tomorrow.  Germany  is scheduled to sell 5 billion euros of two-year
notes tomorrow. It last sold the securities on Feb. 13 at an
average yield of 0.21 percent.  Italian bonds rose for the first time in three days even as
borrowing costs increased at a bill sale.  The Treasury auctioned 7.75 billion euros of one-year
securities at 1.28 percent, up from 1.094 percent at the
previous sale on Feb. 12.  Italy ’s  10-year yield  fell four basis points to 4.60
percent after jumping to 4.96 percent on Feb. 27, the highest
level since Nov. 15.  Italy Auctions  Italy plans to sell as much as 3.5 billion euros of three-
year notes and up to 2 billion euros of 15-year bonds tomorrow.
It last sold the three-year securities on Feb. 13 at 2.30
percent. The Rome-based Treasury is also scheduled to auction
floating-rate notes due in 2017 and 2018.  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of France and  Belgium ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish securities returned 4.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
debt gained 0.1 percent and Germany’s fell 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
