U.K. day-ahead natural gas  prices
surged to their highest in more than a year as  Centrica Plc (CNA) 
restricted withdrawals from the nation’s biggest gas store and
freezing weather gripped  Europe ’s biggest market.  Gas for tomorrow jumped as much as 8.3 percent while the
 within-day  contract rose as much as 11 percent. Minimum
temperatures in London are forecast to be below freezing in
seven of the next 10 days, according to CustomWeather Inc. on
Bloomberg. The 30-year average minimum is 3 degrees (37
Fahrenheit).  Cold weather drove withdrawals of the fuel to a six-day
high yesterday, when 4.5 percent the nation’s reserves were
removed from stores. Centrica Plc’s Rough storage field in the
 North Sea , Britain’s largest, said today it would limit
withdrawal capacity by 25 percent for the four hours through
2:15 p.m.  London  time. Day-ahead gas has averaged 70 pence so
far this year, 17 percent more than in the year-earlier period.  “So far this year, inventories have seen one of the
largest draws ever and the premium of U.K. gas prices to other
European benchmarks widened sharply in order to attract greater
imports from neighboring countries,” Sabine Schels, a commodity
strategist at Bank of America Corp. in London, said in a
research note e-mailed today and dated yesterday. “The U.K. gas
market has yet again been exposed to its deep-rooted supply
problems.”  The day-ahead contract jumped as much as 7.5 pence to 98
pence a therm, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the highest price since Feb. 8, 2012, and is equivalent
to $14.58 per million British thermal units. The price was at
96.25 pence at 12:38 p.m. London time.  Within-day gas  traded at
97.50 pence after rising 10 pence to 101 pence.  Yesterday’s  withdrawal from stores  including Rough was 258
gigawatt-hours, cutting the level to 5,476 gigawatt-hours,
according to data from  National Grid Plc (NG/) , the network manager.
At that pace, they will reach the record low set in March 2010
of 2,924 gigawatt-hours in less than 10 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
