Temperatures in the Midwest and
Great Plains are expected to fall below normal while both coasts
reach seasonal levels as March comes to a close.  From  Montana  to  Ohio  and south to Oklahoma, temperatures
may be at least 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.2 Celsius)
lower than the norm from March 22 to March 26, according to  MDA
Weather Services  in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . A pocket from
eastern Montana to central Nebraska may reach 8 to 14 degrees
below normal.  “The core of the strongest cold should be focused across
the northern half of the nation, though occasionally some deeper
southward penetration is possible,” MDA said.  March 20 is the start of astronomical spring in the
Northern Hemisphere and the month marks the end of the heating
season that begins in November. Cooler weather in March has less
of an impact on energy markets than it would in January, usually
the year’s coldest month.  The normal average temperature in  New York City  on March 15
is 42 degrees (5.6 Celsius), while on Jan. 15, it’s 32,
according to the  National Weather Service . In Chicago it’s 38 on
March 15 and 24 on Jan. 15, the weather service said.  January accounts for 25 percent of seasonal gas-heating
demand compared with about 17 percent for March. About 50
percent of U.S. households use natural gas for heating.  For the rest of this week, temperatures may reach 5 to 8
degrees above normal across the U.S. West and Rocky Mountain
states, according to  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  “Short-term heat is the same to a bit stronger in
 California , with upper 80s in Burbank peaking on Wednesday and
low 90s in Phoenix peaking at 93 on Friday,” Rogers said.  Temperatures are expected to reach 83 degrees in  Los
Angeles  this week, according to the weather service. The normal
high in the city is about 70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
