A Swiss prosecutor is probing
 Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s former Chairman  Daniel Vasella  and other  board 
members after two criminal complaints related to Vasella’s 72
million-Swiss franc ($75 million) payout were filed in Basel.  The public prosecutor is investigating whether Novartis
executives can be charged, Peter Gill, the prosecutor’s
spokesman, said in a telephone interview today.  Vasella’s “golden parachute” came to light after details
were leaked to the press, leading to a public outcry in
 Switzerland  and prompting Vasella to give up the money. Vasella
and the board’s compensation committee failed to disclose the
payments to shareholders, said  Hans-Jacob Heitz , a lawyer who
filed one of the complaints charging the executives with breach
of trust and providing untruthful business information.  “They should have disclosed the payment in the last annual
report at the latest,” Heitz said in a telephone interview
today. Heitz didn’t say how many shareholders he represents. The
other complaint was filed anonymously, according to Gill.  Ulrich Lehner, who may be named head of  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ’s
supervisory board, was a member of key Novartis board committees
involved in the payout, Heitz said.  The probe, an “absolutely” normal procedure, may take
another couple of weeks, Gill said.  Spokesmen for Novartis and ThyssenKrupp weren’t immediately
available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
