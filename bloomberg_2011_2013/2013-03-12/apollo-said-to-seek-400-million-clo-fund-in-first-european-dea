Leon Black ’s  Apollo Global
Management LLC (APO)  is said to be planning its first collateralized
loan obligation in  Europe  amid investor demand for securities
backed by high-yielding debt.  The  private-equity firm  has asked  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to manage
the sale of the 306.5 million-euro ($400 million) deal, ALME
Loan Funding 2013-1, according to three people with knowledge of
the deal, who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private. It plans to include a 180 million-euro top-rated
portion.  Europe’s CLO market was effectively shuttered following the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 as investors
shunned hard-to-value securities. London-based  money manager 
Cairn Capital Ltd. issued a 300.5 million-euro CLO last month,
the first since 2011.  “While there are challenges to a robust return of new
issuance in European CLOs we expect to see more deals coming to
the market over the next few months,” said Vishwanath Tirupattur, global head of securitized products research at
Morgan Stanley in  New York .  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. The Apollo deal can have as much as 10
percent of its collateral in high-yield bonds, said the people.  Spreads on top-rated portions of European CLOs fell to 150
basis points from 295 basis points at the start of 2012,
according to data from Morgan Stanley. The AAA rated portion of
Cairn’s CLO pays a spread of 140 basis points more than
benchmarks, according to Bloomberg data. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Charles Zehren , a spokeswoman for Apollo in New York,
declined to comment on the deal. A spokesman for Citigroup in
 London , who asked not to be identified citing company policy,
also declined to comment.  Two Deals  Before Cairn’s issue, two CLOs have been sold in Europe
since 2008. Pramerica Investment Management Ltd. is also
planning to raise a 300 million-euro CLO, people with the
knowledge of the deal said.  The money manager, which oversaw 26 CLOs as of June 2012,
raised a $721.9 million CLO deal in the U.S. in October,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. market has
been more active with $52.6 billion of deals backed by leveraged
loans sold in 2012, Bloomberg data show.  Details of Apollo’s CLO are as follows:  To contact the reporters on this story:
