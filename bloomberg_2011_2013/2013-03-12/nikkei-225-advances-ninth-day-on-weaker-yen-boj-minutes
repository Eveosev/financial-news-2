Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average halting the longest winning streak
since July 2009, after a technical indicator signaled the market
has advanced too far, too fast.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)  fell 3.1 percent to pace losses
among brokerages, the best performing industry on the  Topix (TPX) 
Index since November. Japan Tobacco Inc. fell 0.7 percent after
the government priced a stake in the cigarette maker below
yesterday’s closing level.  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401) ,
Japan’s biggest steelmaker, jumped 4.4 percent on a report it
will shut a furnace to cut costs.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent to close at 12,314.81 in
Tokyo, snapping an eight-day winning streak. The Topix lost 0.4
percent to 1,035.90 after rising as much as 1 percent. The 
Nikkei’s 14-day relative strength index , a gauge of market
momentum, hit 73 yesterday, above the 70 threshold that some
traders say signals stocks are overbought.  “The market was overheating in the short term and poised
for profit taking,” said  Yutaka Miura , a senior technical
analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s third-
biggest lender by market value. “The  market sentiment  remains
strong. From here, investors will wait and see what policy the
BOJ will actually take.”  The Topix has rallied 43 percent from Nov. 14, when a
general election was announced, fueling optimism a new
government will do more to beat deflation. An index of
 brokerages  surged about 70 percent in that time as increasing
trading volumes spurred expectations of higher fee revenue.  Relative Value  The Topix  traded  at 21.1 times estimated earnings, compared
with 14.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 for the
Stoxx Europe 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Daiwa Securities  dropped 3.1 percent to 651 yen, and  Japan
Asia Investment Co. (8518) , which gets 22 percent of its revenue
outside Japan, declined 7.5 percent to 87 yen after gaining
about 12 percent over the past two days. Ichiyoshi Securities
Co., of which 43 percent is owned by U.S. investors, fell 3.5
percent to 1,037 yen after rising for eight consecutive days.  Shares rose earlier as BOJ deputy governor nominee Kikuo
Iwata said the central bank can end deflation solely through
buying government debt and doesn’t need to purchase riskier
assets to meet its inflation target. Iwata spoke at upper house
parliamentary confirmation hearing today. Separately, minutes
from a BOJ meeting showed members agreed to pursue aggressive
easing to achieve a price target.  New BOJ  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY) ’s 43 percent advance since the elections
that brought Abe to power were announced has been undermined by
declines in the yen. When  converted  back into dollars Japan’s
market has increased about 19 percent, just three percentage
points more than the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  in the same time.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slipped 0.2 percent today. The index
rose 0.3 percent at the close of trading in  New York  yesterday
to within nine points of its record high.  Nippon Paint Co. dropped 5.7 percent to 852 yen, the
biggest drop since March 2011.  Kyodo News  reported Wuthelam
Holdings Pte Ltd. would back out of its takeover bid today. The
paint company announced the withdrawal after the market closed.  Japan  Tobacco dropped 0.7 percent to 2,990 yen after the
government priced a stake in the firm 2 percent below
yesterday’s closing price as part of a 978 billion yen ($10.1
billion) sale to help fund rebuilding projects after the 2011
earthquake and tsunami.  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal gained 4.4 percent to 261 yen
after the Nikkei newspaper reported the oldest of its three
furnaces at its Kimitsu mill in Chiba Prefecture will be closed,
cutting production capacity by 7 percent. The company seeks to
add 200 billion yen to earnings through cost cuts and other
steps, the report said.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 2.9 percent
to 25.72 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.2
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading
volume on the Nikkei 225 was 16 percent above the 30-day
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
