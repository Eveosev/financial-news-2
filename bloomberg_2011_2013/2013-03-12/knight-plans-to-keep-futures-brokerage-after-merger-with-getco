Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) , the
market maker that’s being acquired by Getco LLC, plans to keep
its futures brokerage.   The unit will continue to provide futures execution,
clearing and custody services, according to a March 6 letter to
clients from Thomas M. Joyce, Knight’s chairman and chief
executive officer, and Carl Gilmore, who heads the futures
group.  “We would like to reiterate our commitment to our futures
customers and our futures clearing and custody efforts,” Joyce
and Gilmore said in the letter, which was published on the
company’s website. “Knight Futures is an important part of our
initiative.”  The  Jersey City , New Jersey-based firm agreed in December
to be purchased by Getco in a $1.4 billion deal, ending Knight’s
17 years of independence. Getco was among six financial firms
that bailed out Knight in August, after trading glitches caused
more than $450 million in losses and brought the company to the
brink of bankruptcy.  Knight plans to sell its debt-brokerage unit to  Stifel
Financial Corp. (SF) , seven people with knowledge of the matter said
in February. The firm intends to retain BondPoint, an electronic
trading system for corporate, municipal and government debt, one
of the people said at that time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
