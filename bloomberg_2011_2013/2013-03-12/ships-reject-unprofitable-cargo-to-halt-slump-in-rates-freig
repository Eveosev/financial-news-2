The worst start to a year for
freight rates is leading one of the creators of shipping
derivatives to bet on a recovery as owners of vessels carrying
coal, iron ore and grains turn away cargoes.  The Baltic Dry Index averaged 769 since Jan. 1, the lowest
since at least 1985, according to the Baltic Exchange in  London .
Rates for all vessels in the gauge are unprofitable, data
compiled by Pareto Securities A/S in Oslo show. Investors should
bet on a rebound by buying freight swaps, said Philippe Van Den Abeele, the managing director of Castalia Fund Management (U.K.)
Ltd. and one of the creators of the derivatives market in
shipping two decades ago.  “Owners are saying no to unprofitable cargoes,” said
Peter Sand, a Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based analyst at the Baltic and
International Maritime Council, the trade group whose members
control 65 percent of the global merchant fleet. “It’s
impossible to run a profitable business at these levels. There
is some kind of limit where even owners desperate to relocate or
reposition their ships will not go so low.”  Rates plunged 93 percent since peaking in 2008 after owners
ordered too many vessels just as the global economy entered its
worst recession since World War II. The fleet will expand faster
than demand for a sixth year in 2013, according to Clarkson Plc,
the world’s largest shipbroker. All 12 members of the Bloomberg
Dry Ships Index most recently reported annual losses or
declining profit. That will narrow to six in 2013, analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Running Costs  Capesizes, the largest vessels in the Baltic Dry Index,
earned an average of $6,329 a day this year, according to the
Baltic Exchange, which reports rates on more than 50 maritime
routes. The ships need $7,758 to cover running costs, rising to
about $16,000 once debt repayments are included, according to
Moore Stephens LLP, a London-based accountant that tracks the
industry’s expenses, and Pareto.  Rates may rise as high as $9,750 in the second quarter, 24
percent more than the current cost of forward freight agreements
for the period, said Abeele. He brokered the first FFA in 1992
when he was at Clarkson’s securities unit and now advises a
hedge fund trading the contracts. The vessels will earn an
average of $11,500 this year, according to the median of nine
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Panamaxes, the second-biggest component of the Baltic Dry
Index, averaged $6,479 daily this year. They need $6,606 to
cover running costs, rising to about $11,000 including debt,
according to Moore Stephens and Pareto. Earnings will average
$9,000 this year, about 7 percent more than the current price of
swaps, according to the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Spot Market  “The downside is basically non-existent,” said Abeele.
“We cannot justify selling this market because the underlying
spot market is so low.”  Some owners’ refusal to take cargoes at current rates can
be seen in shipping data. More than 2,400 dry-bulk carriers were
anchored last month out of a global fleet of about 8,500,
compared with annual averages of less than 1,000 in 2009 and
2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A rebound in rates may be curbed because of the scale of
the capacity glut. The fleet of bulk carriers expanded 63
percent to 591 million deadweight tons since the start of 2008,
according to IHS Fairplay, a Redhill, England-based research
company. That compares with a 28 percent gain in dry-bulk
cargoes, Clarkson estimates.  The International Monetary Fund cut its 2013 forecast for
global growth in trade to 3.8 percent in January, from 4.5
percent. About 90 percent of world trade travels by sea, the
Round Table of International Shipping Associations estimates.  Iron Ore  The 17-nation euro area’s economy will contract 0.1 percent
this year after shrinking 0.6 percent in 2012, according to the
average of 54 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Europe 
buys about 14 percent of all seaborne iron ore and coal,
according to Clarkson.  Growth in  Japan , which buys 14 percent of the world’s coal
and iron ore, will slow to 1.2 percent this year from 2.05
percent in 2012, according to the median of 51 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  China, which accounts for about 65 percent of seaborne
demand for iron ore and 18 percent of coal shipments, lacks a
sustainable growth model, outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao said March
5. The two commodities are the biggest sources of demand for
dry-bulk shipping and China is the largest importer of both,
according to Clarkson.  Oil Tankers  The nation’s economy started accelerating again for the
first time in two years in the fourth quarter.  China ’s iron-ore
imports will advance 8 percent this year, from 9 percent in
2012, as demand for thermal coal used in power plants gains 10
percent, from 41 percent, Clarkson estimates show.  Losses for dry-bulk vessels extend across most of the
merchant fleet. The ClarkSea Index, which also includes rates
for container ships and oil tankers, averaged $8,284 in
February, the lowest since at least 1994, according to Clarkson.
The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a gauge of oil-shipping costs,
fell 13 percent this year.  Shares of  Pacific Basin Shipping (2343)  Ltd., the largest member
of the Bloomberg Dry Ships Index, rose 9.2 percent this year and
will retreat 2.3 percent to HK$4.64 in 12 months, according to
the average of 17 analyst estimates. The Hong Kong-based
operator of 189 dry-bulk carriers will  report profit  of $31.3
million this year, after a $158.5 million loss in 2012, the mean
of 13 estimates shows. An e-mail to the company’s investor
relations department seeking comment wasn’t answered.  Global Fleet  STX Pan Ocean (STX)  Co., which has the second-largest weighting
in the index, gained 14 percent this year in Singapore trading
and will advance 12 percent to S$6.30 in 12 months, the average
of 11 estimates shows. The Seoul-based company also operates oil
tankers and car carriers. An e-mail to the company seeking
comment wasn’t answered.  Demolitions will exceed 20 million deadweight tons for a
third consecutive year in 2013, according to Clarkson. That will
combine with fewer orders for new ships to slow fleet growth to
7 percent, from 10 percent in 2012, Clarkson estimates.
Outstanding orders at shipyards are equal to 17 percent of
existing capacity, down from a record 74 percent in 2009, IHS
data show.  “Owners’ hands will be forced by the prolonged period of
low earnings,” said Will Fray, a senior analyst at Maritime
Strategies International Ltd., a London-based research company.
“It’s a cyclical industry, so it’s more a time to buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
