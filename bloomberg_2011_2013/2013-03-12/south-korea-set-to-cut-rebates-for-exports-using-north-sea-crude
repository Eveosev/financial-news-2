South Korean refiners that import
North Sea crude will have their rebates for oil-product exports
reduced under tax changes planned to start April 1, according to
three government and refinery officials.  Companies have been asked to submit their views on the
proposed tax revisions by March 18, according to officials at
the Korea Customs Service, SK Innovation Co. and the Korea
Petroleum Association who asked not to be identified, citing
department and company policies. The new rules would apply to
refiners that buy North Sea crude, which is exempt from a South
Korean import tariff of 3 percent under a free trade agreement
with the European Union, the officials said today.  South Korean refiners are currently entitled to a tax
rebate on all their oil-product exports, even if they are
produced using duty-free crude, according to the Korea Petroleum
Association official. The government plans to adjust the refund
depending on the proportion of the refiners’  crude imports  that
aren’t subject to the tariff, according to a statement on the
Korea Customs Service’s website on Feb. 25.  South Korea’s crude imports from Norway and the U.K.
totaled 39.78 million barrels in 2012, accounting for 4.2
percent of its total overseas purchases, according to data from
Korea National Oil Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
