IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH) ’s 2020 bonds
jumped, pushing the yield to the lowest in almost five months,
after the company controlled by Israeli business tycoon Nochi Dankner reached a debt accord to avert default.  IDB Holding, which is struggling to meet payments on about
2.06 billion shekels ($560 million) of debt, offered to transfer
15 percent of the company’s shares to bondholders as well as
inject 500 million shekels in cash. The debt framework also
calls for three new bond series at a value of about 1.56 billion
shekels to be issued,  according to a filing  to the Tel Aviv
bourse today.  The yield on IDB’s 1.07 billion shekels of 5.1 percent
bonds plunged 533 basis points, or 5.33 percentage point, to
48.34 percent, the lowest since Oct. 29, at the close in  Tel
Aviv . The  shares  rose 11 percent, the most since Feb. 20, to
12.47 shekels. The yield on  Israel ’s 4.25 percent benchmark
bonds due March 2023 fell for the first time since March 4,
declining one basis point, to 4 percent.  “This is not a day of celebration for bondholders as the
company still has to show how it is going to make future
payments,” said Yaniv Pagot, chief strategist at  Ramat Gan ,
Israel-based Ayalon Group Ltd. “IDB is winning time and the
controlling shareholder gets the chance to stay in place.”  Standard & Poor’s Maalot in December cut the holding
company’s debt rating to default citing a “large gap” between
its available funds and obligations. Argentinian businessman
Eduardo Elsztain agreed in September to pay $25 million for 10
percent of IDB’s parent company Ganden Holdings Ltd., with the
option of investing another $75 million.  Unprofitable Investments  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, declined for a third day, easing
0.1 percent to 284.03.  Dankner saw IDB Holding  shares  plunge 74 percent last year,
hitting a record low on Dec. 27, as a combination of
unprofitable investments and regulations to boost competition
prompted the company to disclose a “going concern” warning on
Aug. 31. Tel Aviv-based IDB Holdings’  market value  has dropped
to 605 million shekels from 5.06 billion shekels at the end of
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The debt agreement, which bondholders still need to approve
at a general meeting, comes after the company’s investment unit
IDB Development Corp. last week sold its stake in  Clal
Industries Ltd. (CII)  to boost funding. Dankner, who has been seeking
funds to avoid default, last year arranged the investment from
Elsztain and sold an insurance company to a unit of  Warren
Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B)  for $221 million.  Cash Crunch  IDB Development bondholders earlier this month gave
authorization to act on debt restructuring and to take legal
steps as necessary after S&P Maalot in January cut the company’s
rating to ilB, saying it may fall 1 billion shekels short of
cash to cover liabilities in 2014. York Capital Management, the
biggest IDB Development bondholder, suggested converting more
than half of IDB debt owed to bondholders and banks into shares,
Calcalist reported Feb. 10.  The yield on IDB Development’s 4.5 percent bond due June
2018 fell for the first time in four days, dropping 110 basis
points to 20.13 percent  In the local  debt market , the two-year break-even rate, the
yield difference between the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-
rate government debt of similar maturity, declined for the first
time in three days, falling three basis points to 251 basis
points. That implies an average annual inflation rate of 2.51
percent over the period. The government’s target range is
between 1 percent and 3 percent.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, fell one basis point to
1.63 percent. The  Bank of Israel  last month kept  interest rates 
at 1.75 percent. The shekel weakened 0.1 percent to 3.6799 to a
dollar, trimming this month’s appreciation to 0.9 percent, the
fifth-best performer among 31 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
