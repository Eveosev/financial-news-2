Thailand’s baht rose the most in
six weeks and  government bonds  advanced after overseas investors
boosted their holdings of the nation’s debt, drawn by yields
that are relatively high compared with developed nations.  The currency climbed to the strongest level in 19 months
after global funds  bought  $156 million more sovereign notes than
they sold yesterday, the biggest net purchases this month, Thai
Bond Market Association data show. Prime Minister Yingluck
Shinawatra said yesterday the government is targeting an annual
growth rate of 4 percent to 5 percent over the long term. The
economy grew 6.4 percent in 2012, official data show.  The baht rose 0.3 percent to 29.63 per dollar as of 3:10
p.m. in Bangkok, the biggest advance since Jan. 30, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency touched 29.57, the
strongest level since August 2011, and has gained 3.2 percent
this year, the most in  Asia . One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, held steady at 5.22 percent.  “Funds are flowing into Thailand and that put appreciation
pressure on the baht,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist
covering  emerging markets  at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute
Inc. in Tokyo. “The authorities seem to be tolerant of gains so
far.”  The baht climbed by as much as 0.5 percent after it
breached a recent psychological support level of around 29.65,
according to Nalin Chutchotitham, a Bangkok-based analyst at
 Kasikornbank Pcl. (KBANK)  Prior to today, the baht’s strongest level
this year was 29.66 reached on Jan. 21 and Jan. 31.  More Easing  Asian currencies were supported after Kikuo Iwata, the
nominee for the deputy governor of the  Bank of Japan (8301) , said today
decisive monetary easing is needed.  “Generally, the move up among the Asian currencies is led
by speculation of more liquidity coming in from  Japan  in
addition to the U.S.,” Kasikornbank’s Nalin said.  Thailand’s benchmark 10-year bond yields 3.65 percent,
compared with 2.05 percent for similar-maturity  U.S. Treasuries 
and 0.64 percent in Japan. Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor
Pongpen Ruengvirayudh said last week the monetary authority is
seeking to encourage outflows to ease pressure on the baht.  The yield on Thailand’s 3.625 percent government notes due
June 2023 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.65 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate
was 3.66 percent yesterday, near the 3.663 percent reached on
March 7 that was the highest level since Feb. 4.  “When the yields rose, it provided a good buying
opportunity for investors seeking better returns,” Dai-Ichi’s
Nishihama said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
