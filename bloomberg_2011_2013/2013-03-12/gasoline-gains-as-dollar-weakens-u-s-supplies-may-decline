Gasoline rose as a weaker dollar
sparked a commodity rally and on speculation U.S. inventories
declined last week. Crack spreads and backwardation narrowed.  Futures gained as West Texas Intermediate crude on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange jumped 1 percent. The dollar slipped
0.2 percent against the euro, boosting the investment appeal of
commodities. The Energy Information Administration will probably
report tomorrow that U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell 1.2 million
barrels last week, according to the median of nine analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “The dollar is under pressure,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“Gasoline held yesterday’s low and turned around. We’re seeing
some short-covering ahead of the inventory report.”  April-delivery gasoline rose 1.27 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$3.1651 a gallon at 9:44 a.m. on the Nymex on volume that was 70
percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  The April  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
on Nymex narrowed 50 cents to $39.84 a barrel. The  spread 
against Brent oil on ICE Futures Europe Exchange slipped 7 cents
to $22.11.  The premium for April futures over later-month contracts,
or backwardation, narrowed, indicating less concern that
supplies will be scarce. The gap between April and September
slipped 1.57 cents to 19.24 cents a gallon, the smallest spread
since Jan. 25.  Heating oil for April delivery advanced 2.09 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.99 a gallon on volume that was 6.7 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day. Supplies of
distillates, including diesel and heating oil, probably declined
2 million barrels last week, according to the survey.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.7 cent to
$3.703 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. It was the first
increase since Feb. 26. Prices are 9.8 cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
