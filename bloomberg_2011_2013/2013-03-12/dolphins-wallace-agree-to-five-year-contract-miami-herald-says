The Miami Dolphins agreed to a
five-year contract with free-agent wide receiver  Mike Wallace 
that’s worth $60 million to $65 million, the Miami Herald said,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the deal.  Wallace, 26, spent his first four National Football League
seasons in Pittsburgh and led the Steelers in receiving yards
the past three years. He’s totaled 235 receptions for 4,042
yards and 32 touchdowns.  Wallace’s contract will include about $30 million in
guaranteed money and makes him the third-highest paid receiver
in the NFL behind  Calvin Johnson  of the Detroit Lions and Larry Fitzgerald of the Arizona Cardinals, the Herald said.  Wallace had eight touchdown receptions for the Steelers
each of the past two seasons after catching 10 scoring passes in
2010. Dolphins receivers had a combined three touchdown catches
last season, the fewest in the NFL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
