Treasuries snapped six days of
declines before the first of three debt auctions totaling $66
billion this week.  Benchmark  10-year yields  were four basis points from the
highest level in 11 months. The government is scheduled to sell
$32 billion of three-year notes today, $21 billion of 10-year
debt tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on March 14.
Yields surged last week as a stronger-than-expected jobs gain
increased optimism the pace of economic growth will pick up.
The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year Treasuries
instead of German bunds widened to the most since June 2010.  “The auction will be an important factor today,” said
 Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit
Global Research in Milan. “People have been reallocating money
away from Treasuries, and that has pushed up yields. There has
been an underperformance of U.S. yields versus German yields and
we think that’s gone too far.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.04 percent at 8:57 a.m. London time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 2 percent note due
February 2023 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 99
5/8. The rate climbed to 2.08 percent on March 8, which was the
highest level since April.  The  yield difference , or spread, between 10-year Treasury
notes and similar-maturity German bunds was 54 basis points.
UniCredit is betting that the spread will narrow to as little as
20 basis points over the next few weeks, Cazzulani said.  Global Spread  Treasuries due in 10 years and more are trading at the
cheapest level in 19 months relative to global peers with
similar maturities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.
Yields on the Treasuries were 54 basis points higher on March 8
than those in an index of other sovereign debt due in 10 years
and more, the indexes show. That was the most since August 2011.  U.S. retail  sales  advanced in February for a fourth month,
rising 0.5 percent, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce
Department reports the figure tomorrow.  “The economy looks quite good, not very strong but strong
enough,” said Kei Katayama, who buys non-yen debt for Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd. in  Tokyo , which manages the equivalent of $51.4
billion and is part of  Japan ’s second-largest brokerage.
“Yields may rise toward year-end.”  Hiring Increase  Government data on March 8 showed the U.S. economy gained
236,000 jobs in February, versus 165,000 projected by a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt
a month to fuel growth by putting downward pressure on yields.  The three-year notes being sold today yielded 0.42 percent
in pre-auction trading, versus 0.411 percent at the prior sale
on Feb. 12.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their orders with the Treasury, purchased a record amount of
three-year debt for the third-straight time last month. They
snapped up 26.9 percent of the securities, topping the previous
record of 26.4 percent at the January sale.  Indirect bidders , the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 18 percent of the notes, a record low.  Park Sungjin, the Seoul-based head of asset management at
Meritz Securities Co., which oversees $7 billion, said he set a
bet against five-year notes two weeks ago.  “The  U.S. economy  is in a recovery,” Park said. Five-year
yields may rise past 1 percent by Dec. 31 from about 0.90
percent today, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
