U.S. cattle prices will rebound to
a record this year as a recovery in the world’s largest economy
stokes demand for red meat, top beef producer  JBS SA (JBSS3)  said.  The increase in consumption is coming at a time ranches in
the U.S. still haven’t recuperated from a drought that reduced
herds and led Cargill Inc. to shut a plant in January, JBS Chief
Executive Officer Wesley Batista said yesterday in an interview
at the headquarters of JBS’s parent J&F Participacoes SA in  Sao
Paulo . Cattle futures have dropped 4.9 percent in  Chicago  from a
record $1.35175 a pound on Jan. 11 amid speculation that a rise
in retail beef prices will boost demand for chicken meat and
pork.  “This decline in prices will be short lived,” he said.
“Global demand continues to rise and, as the  U.S. economy 
slowly recovers, domestic demand will improve too.”  A surge in corn and soybean prices last year amid the worst
U.S. drought in more than five decades prompted ranchers to cull
animals at a record pace and led the U.S. cattle herd to drop to
the lowest level since 1952.  The shutdown of Minneapolis-based Cargill’s plant in Texas,
which represented about 3 percent of U.S. slaughtering capacity,
will likely boost profits at rivals including JBS as they
produce more to offset the shortfall, Batista said.  Cattle for April deliver rose 0.7 percent to $1.29 at 10:12
a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
