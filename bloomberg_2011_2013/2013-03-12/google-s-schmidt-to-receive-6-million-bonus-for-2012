Google Inc. (GOOG)  Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt will receive a bonus of $6 million for 2012, the
operator of the world’s biggest search engine said.  Co-founders Sergey Brin and  Larry Page  aren’t receiving
bonuses, according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  Schmidt, who handed the chief executive officer title to
Page in 2011, owns about 2.5 percent of Google’s outstanding
shares and has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
