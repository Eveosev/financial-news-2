Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerlandâ€™s second-biggest bank, plans to cut 94 jobs at its
main  New York  office.  The reductions will begin April 1 at the Madison Avenue
location, the Zurich-based company said today in a  filing  with
the state Department of Labor. Affected employees have already
been notified, said Jack Grone, a spokesman for the bank.  Credit Suisse is seeking an additional 400 million Swiss
francs ($422 million) in cost savings by the end of 2015, on top
of 4 billion francs in planned cuts announced since 2011, the
firm said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
