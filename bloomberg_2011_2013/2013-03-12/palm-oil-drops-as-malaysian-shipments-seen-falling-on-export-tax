Palm oil fell for the first time in
four days on speculation that exports from  Malaysia , the world’s
second-largest producer, may decline for a fifth month as a tax
on shipments curbs demand among importers.  The contract for May delivery lost as much as 1.5 percent
to 2,413 ringgit ($777) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and ended the morning session at 2,434 ringgit in  Kuala
Lumpur . Futures have lost 27 percent in the past year on rising
global oilseed supplies and slowing demand.  Exports fell 14 percent to 1.4 million tons in February for
a fourth monthly drop, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board. The government said in October it would cut the export
tax to between 4.5 percent and 8.5 percent, from about 23
percent, from Jan. 1, to clear stockpiles. The duty for March
was fixed at 4.5 percent after a zero rate in January and
February as the base price in the first two months of the year
was below the threshold that triggers the minimum tax.  “In March, we may see a decline in crude  palm oil  exports
as well, as the 4.5 percent export tax come into effect and may
deter price sensitive buyers from countries like  India ,” Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance Investment Bank Bhd., wrote in a
report. “With production retreating further due to the seasonal
downcycle, we expect further moderation in inventories, albeit
at a slow rate as exports are not expected to be strong.”  Output slumped 19 percent to 1.3 million tons last month,
while inventories shrank to 2.44 million tons, the board said
yesterday. Malaysian  reserves  reached a record 2.63 million tons
in December. Shipments were little changed at 441,025 tons in
the first 10 days of March from 440,830 tons in the same period
in February, surveyor Intertek said yesterday.  Soybean oil  for May delivery declined 0.6 percent to 50.14
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for May
delivery retreated 0.6 percent to $14.7025 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September dropped 0.7
percent to 6,534  yuan  ($1,051) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange . Soybean oil for delivery in the same month declined
0.2 percent to 8,180 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
