Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) ,
owner of cable networks TLC and Animal Planet, raised $1.2
billion in its first bond sale in 10 months.  The company’s $350 million of 3.25 percent, 10-year debt
yields 125 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries
and $850 million of 4.875 percent, 30-year bonds pay a spread of
165 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
offering was marketed earlier today at $1 billion.  Discovery is expected to use most of the proceeds to help
fund its $1.7 billion acquisition of German broadcaster
ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG’s SBS Nordic unit, consisting of
television networks in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and  Finland ,
Moody’s Investors Service said today in a statement. Moody’s
will rate the bonds Baa2, its second-lowest investment-grade
ranking.  Discovery last sold securities in May, issuing $500 million
each of 3.3 percent, 10-year notes at a relative yield of 155
basis points and 4.95 percent, 30-year notes at 195 basis
points, Bloomberg data show. The notes due 2042 traded at 102.5
cents on the dollar to yield 4.79 percent on March 8, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan
Chase & Co. managed the offering for the  Silver Spring ,
Maryland-based company, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
