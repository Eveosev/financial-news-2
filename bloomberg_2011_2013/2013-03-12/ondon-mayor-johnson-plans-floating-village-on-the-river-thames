London Mayor  Boris Johnson  plans to
create a village that floats on the  River Thames  as the U.K.
capital strives to develop derelict industrial sites on the
city’s eastern waterfront.  The mayor is starting an international competition for
developers for the project, which will float on a 15-acre (6
hectare) area of water in east London, Johnson said in an e-
mailed statement today. The completed project will be 1 1/2
times the size of the city’s Green Park, he said.  “It has the potential to become one of the most sought-
after addresses in the capital while breathing new life back
into London’s waterways,” Johnson said.  London’s docks are being targeted for redevelopment as a
scarcity of land in the city center pushes new projects
eastward. The  London  Development Agency is seeking a partner to
develop Royal Albert Docks, a 35-acre patch of derelict docks,
unused warehouses and industrial land near London City Airport.  The floating village project, located near the Emirates
Airline cable car, will be linked to other parts of the capital
by the Docklands Light Rail system and the Crossrail train,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
