France , like much of  Europe , woke
up to a blanket of snow this morning, with the precipitation
disrupting train services, canceling flights and stranding
vehicles on highways.  The French Aviation Authority said it has asked Paris
airports  Charles de Gaulle  and Orly to cut the number of their
flights by 25 percent. The national rail service, SNCF, asked
people to avoid traveling to Paris. There were delays and
canceled services on several lines in the French capital’s
subway system.  “Because of unfavorable weather conditions, SNCF
recommends that travelers avoid trying to get to Paris this
morning,” it said in a statement. The company’s suburban train
service is “severely disrupted,” it said.  Meteo France, the country’s weather service, has placed 29
districts in northern France on “orange” alert, saying it
expects average snowfall in the region of between 5 and 15
centimeters.  All high-speed rail services to and from the the
northeastern city of Lille were halted this morning.
Additionally, about 600 vehicles were blocked on highway A16 in
the Nord Pas-de-Calais region north of Paris last night, with
100 still stranded,  Agence France-Presse  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
