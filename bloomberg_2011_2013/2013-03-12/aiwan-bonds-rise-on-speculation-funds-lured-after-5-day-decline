Taiwan ’s 10-year government bond
yields fell from the highest level since September 2011 on
speculation some investors took advantage of a five-day decline
in prices to buy the securities.  Borrowing costs on the notes climbed 16 basis points in the
last two days, the largest two-day jump for a benchmark bond of
that tenor in more than four years. Demand for debt had waned
after reports showed  job creation  in the U.S., Taiwan’s second-
biggest export market, beat economists’ estimates in February,
while the jobless rate dropped to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent.
The Taiex index of shares traded 1.2 percent off a one-year high
as global funds bought $404 million more stocks than they sold
in March, taking 2013 net purchases to $2.1 billion, exchange
data show.  “Some traders think it’s pretty much impossible for yields
to rise by the same extent as in the past few days,” said Sam
Chang, a fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei.
“We’re seeing people closing positions” that bet on further
declines, he said.  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due March 2023 slipped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.37 percent in
Taipei, according to prices from Gretai Securities Market. The
rate touched 1.4 percent earlier, the highest for a benchmark
10-year yield since September 2011.  The first yuan-denominated bonds sold in Taiwan, an issue
from Chinatrust Commercial Bank, started trading today and the
yield was unchanged at 2.9 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  Taiwan Dollar  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed at NT$29.73 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.810 yesterday, the weakest level since Sept. 10.
The currency was trading 0.2 percent stronger at NT$29.673 one
minute before the 4 p.m. close.  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 11 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month  non-deliverable forwards  strengthened 0.1 percent
to NT$29.67 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  over a month used to price options, fell 32 basis points to
3.34 percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little
changed at 0.386 percent, according to the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
