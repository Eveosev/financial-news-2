Pattern Energy Group LP, a closely
held renewable energy company backed by private equity investor
Riverstone Holdings LLC, said it received about $700 million in
debt financing to build its South Kent wind farm in  Canada .  The deal included multiple banks and was structured with
joint venture partner  Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) , which owns half the
project, Pattern spokesman Matt  Dallas  said today by e-mail. He
wouldnâ€™t name the lenders.  South Kent, located in southern Ontario near the shores of
Lake Erie, will have a generating capacity of 270 megawatts and
consist of components made at factories in the province, San
Francisco-based Pattern said today in a statement.  Siemens AG (SIE)  is
providing the wind turbines and blades, and CS Wind Corp. is
supplying the towers.  The wind farm may enter operation by March 2014, and the
Ontario Power Authority has a 20-year contract to purchase its
power for 13.5 Canadian cents (13.2 cents) a kilowatt-hour,
Dallas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
