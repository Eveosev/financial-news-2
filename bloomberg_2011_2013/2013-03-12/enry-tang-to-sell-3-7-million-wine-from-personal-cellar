Henry Tang , whose bid to become
 Hong Kong ’s chief executive suffered after the Feb. 2012
discovery of an illegal wine cellar at his house, is auctioning
off part of his collection.  An assortment of 810 lots exclusively from Burgundy goes on
sale on March 15 and 16 in a Hong Kong event that Christie’s
International estimates will raise HK$29 million ($3.8 million).
The top lot is a case of Romanee-Conti 1995 that carries a high
estimate of HK$1 million ($129,000).  Tang, who, according to the book “Billionaire’s Vinegar,”
attended a seven-day wine tasting marathon in Munich in 1998,
has amassed one of Hong Kong’s most extensive collections.  “It ranks among the largest and most complete wine
collections in the world,” Christie’s said on its website.
“The collection is as worldly as the collector.”  In 2008, while Tang was Hong Kong chief secretary, Hong
Kong dropped all wine import duties. The city has grown to 
become the world’s largest rare and fine-wine auction market.  Investor appetite in  China  that drove Bordeaux prices to
record levels in mid-2011 before a price slump has now switched
increasingly to rarer Burgundies.  Other lots that may attract heavy bidding are a case of
Montrachet Domaine de la Romanee-Conti 1978 carrying a high
presale estimate of HK$600,000 and a case of Vosne-Romanee Cros
Parantoux 1996 Cote de Nuits, Henry Jayer at HK$550,000.  Tang, who was the city’s former second-highest ranked
official, lost to Leung Chun-ying over illegal construction at
his home in the upmarket Kowloon Tong district.  (Frederik Balfour is a reporter-at-large for Muse, the arts
