A top anti-corruption lawmaker from
 Russia ’s ruling party is denying impropriety after accusations
that her family hid ownership of a luxury property in Moscow.  Irina Yarovaya, head of the State Duma’s security and anti-
corruption committee, is living in an apartment worth at least
$2 million, according to a blog  posting  yesterday by activist
Alexey Navalny and a  report  in the New Times magazine. The
property was bought in 2006 and registered in the name of
Yarovaya’s daughter, who was 17 at the time, the New Times said.
The asset wasn’t included on the lawmaker’s official income and
property declaration, it said.  Yarovaya didn’t violate any law because declaring property
owned by underage children has only been a requirement since
2011, Konstantin Mazurevsky, a senior member of the governing
 United Russia  party, said in a  statement  on its website.  The real estate controversy is the second corruption
scandal for United Russia in less than a month. Vladimir Pekhtin
Feb. 20 gave up his seat and resigned as chairman of the Duma’s
ethics committee after bloggers published documents showing he
owned luxury property in  Florida .  To contact the reporter on this story:
