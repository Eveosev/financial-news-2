Advertising delivered through
social media or on mobile phones needs to provide clear
disclosures and abide by the same requirements that apply to
newspaper and television messages, the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission said.  “Advertisers are responsible for ensuring that their
messages are truthful and not deceptive,” the agency  said  in
updated guidelines issued today. It said it would take
enforcement action against companies that violate  consumer
protection laws .  The guidelines aim to provide practical tools for
advertising on smartphones or through social media like  Facebook
Inc. (FB)  or Twitter Inc. services. The suggestions  update   the “Dot
Com Disclosures” guidance the FTC issued in 2000 to cover the
rise of online shopping.  Advertisers need to take into account that most consumers
won’t scroll through a long ad for information, the full cost of
a product should be presented before a purchase is made, and
presenting hyperlinks that just say “disclaimer” or “more
information” isn’t adequate, according to the guidelines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
