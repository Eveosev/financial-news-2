Rubber retreated for the first time
in six days as inventories in  China  and  Japan  advanced, raising
concern that demand will slow for the commodity used for tires
and gloves.  The contract for delivery in August fell as much as 1.6
percent to 296.2 yen a kilogram ($3,067 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange, before trading at 297 at 11:04 a.m.
local time. Futures ended at 301.1 yen yesterday, the highest
settlement since Feb. 20.  Stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses rose 3.8 percent to
11,363 tons on Feb. 28, the Rubber Trade Association of Japan
said yesterday. Inventories in China, the biggest user, rose
4,182 tons to 107,481 tons, the highest level in three years,
based on a survey of nine warehouses in  Shanghai , Shandong,
Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the Shanghai Futures Exchange said
on March 8.  “Inventories are at high levels in China and Japan because
demand is still weak,” Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity broker
Yutaka Shoji Co., said by phone from Tokyo today.  Total vehicle sales in China fell 14 percent from a year
earlier to 1.35 million units in February, the China Association
of Automobile Manufacturers said yesterday.  The contract for September delivery on the SHFE fell 1.6
percent to 23,615  yuan  ($3,795) a ton. Thai rubber free-on-board
rose 1.1 percent to 91 baht ($3.07) a kilogram yesterday,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
