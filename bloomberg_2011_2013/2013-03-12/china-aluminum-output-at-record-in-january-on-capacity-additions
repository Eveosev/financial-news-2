Aluminum production in  China , the
biggest producer and user, climbed to a record in January on
capacity additions, data from the National Bureau of Statistics
showed today.  Production was 1.78 million metric tons in January,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on the data. The
figure exceeded the previous record of 1.75 million tons in
August, said Zhang Chenguang, an analyst at SMM Information &
Technology Co. The bureau doesn’t release January output data
alone and may revise previous data without disclosure.  Rising output will probably weigh on prices and force
higher-cost smelters to cut output, affecting their earnings.
Inventories tallied by the Shanghai Futures Exchange expanded to
492,267 tons last week, the highest since November 2010, as
those in major trading hubs climbed to a record in February.  “The additions of new capacity far exceeded the output
cuts,” said SMM’s Zhang from  Shanghai . “We’ll probably see
further output constraints later this year.”  Output in the first two months jumped 15 percent from a
year ago to 3.51 million tons, while February output was 1.73
million tons, the bureau said in an e-mailed statement.  China Power Investment Corp., the nation’s second-largest
producer, will eliminate 200,000 tons to 300,000 tons of
obsolete capacity, and has no plan to add more, President Lu
Qizhou said on March 6. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., or Chalco,
said in January it will report a “substantial” loss for 2012
on falling prices.  More Cuts  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange has declined 12 percent in the past year to $1,953.75 a
ton at 1:39 p.m. in Shanghai. The contract for June delivery on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange was at 14,875  yuan  ($2,391) a ton.  “Our own survey showed 451,000 tons of output capacity
closed due to losses, and smelters are considering shutting
another 500,000 tons if prices remain low,” Zhang said.  Aluminum demand in China is expected to rise 8.6 percent
this year to 23.35 million tons, while output may grow 9.8
percent to 24 million tons, Yao Xizhi, an analyst at Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co., said in January.  Production of aluminum products gained 16 percent from a
year ago to 4.65 million tons in January-February, while alumina
output grew 15 percent to 6.81 million tons in the period, data
from the statistics bureau showed.  Companies have delayed new projects as prices are below a
break-even level of 16,000 yuan a ton, and there may be “large-
scale” output cuts if prices stay low, Zhang Xuexin, chairman
of Xinfa Group, said on March 8.  Copper  output  in the first two months this year rose 12
percent to 975,000 tons, and production in February was 483,000
tons, according to the bureau.  NOTE: Percentage changes are provided by the National
