  Qatar Telecom QSC (QTEL) , the country’s
biggest company by revenue, reported a 74 percent increase in
third-quarter profit after its Indonesian unit completed a one-
time sale of telecommunication towers.  Net income  for the quarter rose 1.07 billion riyals ($290
million) from 616 million riyals a year earlier, according to an
e-mailed release today from the company. EFG-Hermes  forecast  net
income of 670 million riyals on Sept. 27, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue gained 6.2 percent to 8.63
billion riyals and the number of customers increased by 8.3
percent to 89.2 million.  Qtel, as the company is known, is expanding overseas amid
competition in its home market from  Vodafone Qatar (VFQS) , which began
operations three years ago. Earlier this month, the company said
it raised its stake in  Kuwait ’s National Mobile
Telecommunications Co. to 92 percent from 53 percent.  PT IndoSat (ISAT) , a unit of Qtel, completed the sale and lease
back of 2,500 towers to PT Tower Bersama Infrastructure for $406
million, according to an Aug. 6 statement.  Qtel’s EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, gained 3.6 percent to 3.865
billion riyals, according to today’s statement.  Qtel shares  advanced 0.6 percent to 103.3 riyals on the
Qatar Exchange before the financial results were announced. The
company’s stock has gained 9.8 percent this year compared with a
2.7 percent loss for the  QE Index (DSM)  of Qatari companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
