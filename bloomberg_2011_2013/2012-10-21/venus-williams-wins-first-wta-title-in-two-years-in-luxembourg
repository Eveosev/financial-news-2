Venus Williams  ended the longest
title drought of a tennis career slowed by injuries and illness
by winning the Luxembourg Open.  The 32-year-old American beat Monica Niculescu of Romania
6-2, 6-3 yesterday for her 44th WTA singles title and first
since winning in Acapulco in February, 2010.  Williams started her 2012 season in March following a
seven-month layoff while taking medicine for Sjogren’s syndrome,
an energy-sapping autoimmune disease that also causes joint
pain. Her best performance in nine previous tournaments this
year was reaching the Cincinnati semifinals in August.  “Coming to the tournament this week I was just trying to
play well,” Williams said in comments distributed by the WTA.
“I didn’t know if I could win this event, so to stand here as
the winner is a wonderful way for me to end the year, and it
really makes me look forward to next year as well.”  Since winning in Acapulco more than 2 1/2 years ago,
Williams missed most of the second half of 2010 with a knee
injury and the majority of the first half of 2011 with hip and
abdominal injuries. She then took time out to treat her illness.  Her career haul of 44 singles titles, which includes seven
Grand Slam championships, is second-most among active players,
trailing only sister Serena, who has won 45. Yesterday’s
victory, which improved her record to 44-27 in finals, also
lifted her to No. 24 from 41 in the  WTA singles rankings.   “My main goal coming here was to make the top 32 and be
seeded going into the Australian Open,” Williams added.
“Wherever I end up, it’s just very rewarding to win here after
facing a lot of challenges.”  Caroline Wozniacki  of  Denmark  beat top seed Samantha Stosur
of Australia 6-2, 4-6, 7-5 in yesterday’s Kremlin Cup final in
Moscow. Andreas Seppi of  Italy  took the men’s title with a 3-6,
7-6 (7-3), 6-3 win over  Brazil ’s Thomaz Bellucci.  Argentina ’s Juan Martin del Potro defeated Slovenian
qualifier Grega Zemlja in straight sets in the Erste Bank Open
final in Vienna. Del Potro won 7-5, 6-3 after losing to Jo- Wilfried Tsonga in last year’s final.  France ’s Tsonga was beaten by Tomas Berdych of the  Czech
Republic  in the Stockholm Open final, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
