The Canadian government’s decision
to block the C$5.2 billion ($5.23 billion) bid by Petroliam
Nasional Bhd of Malaysia for Calgary-based  Progress Energy
Resources Corp. (PRQ)  is not a precedent for other rulings,
International Trade Minister Ed Fast said.  Speaking to reporters in Vancouver, Fast said the decision
on Petronas, as the Malaysian state-owned company is known,
doesn’t mean Beijing-based  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s $15.1 billion takeover
of Calgary-based  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  will be rejected.  “This decision does not set a precedent because every
single application is considered on its own merits,” Fast said.
“Each application has its own specific circumstances that are
being brought to bear.”  While  Canada  welcomes foreign investment, it won’t rubber
stamp takeovers, Fast said today at a press conference on border
security and cargo trade between the U.S. and Canada. Petronas
still has time to respond to the government’s concerns about the
Progress bid, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
