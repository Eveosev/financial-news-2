Nakheel PJSC, the builder of
artificial islands off Dubai’s coast, said nine-month profit
surged 83 percent as demand for its properties climbed and
almost all of its retail space was leased.  Net income for the period ended Sept. 30 rose to 1.1
billion dirhams ($299 million) from 600 million dirhams a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today. Revenue more
than doubled to 4.5 billion dirhams from 2 billion dirhams.  Nakheel, which almost drove Dubai’s government into
bankruptcy after the 2008 credit crunch slashed property values
by more than 65 percent, is completing delayed projects and
trying to increase revenue from shopping-mall and hotel
operations. Earnings were bolstered by “near 100 percent
occupancy” of retail and other leased assets, Dubai-based
Nakheel said today.  The developer wrote down the value of its real estate by
78.6 billion dirhams from late 2008 through mid-2010, and it
received a bailout from Dubai’s government in 2009. The company
also shelved several large projects, labeling them long-term,
including two palm-tree-shaped islands along the emirate’s
 Persian Gulf  coast.  The company, which restructured $16 billion of debt, said
today that cash payments to trade creditors have reached 9.4
billion dirhams. Nakheel has also reduced long-term liabilities
to its customers by 7.2 billion dirhams through consolidation
and swap transactions, it said.  The government-controlled developer has provided buyers
with the keys to 4,000 homes since the restructuring, Nakheel
said. Most properties now under construction are expected to be
handed over to customers in the last quarter of 2012 and in
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
