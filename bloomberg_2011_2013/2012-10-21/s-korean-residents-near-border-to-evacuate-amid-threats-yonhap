About 820 South Korean residents
near the border with  North Korea  were ordered to temporarily
evacuate tomorrow, Yonhap News reported, citing unidentified
military officials.   North Korea’s army on Oct. 19 threatened to fire on South
Korean activist groups if they carry out a plan to send anti-Kim
Jong Un leaflets into the North tomorrow.   South Korea ’s military is prepared to “completely
destroy” the origin of a North Korean attack if it occurs,
Defense Minister Kim Kwan Jin told lawmakers on the same day.  A group of South Korean organizations plans to send 200,000
leaflets by balloons near the demilitarized zone at 11 a.m.
tomorrow, according to Park Sang Hak, leader of the Fighters for
Free North Korea, which is organizing the event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
