New York  Yankees CC Sabathia said he
will make a return trip to a surgeon to have tests on his left
pitching elbow that has “off and on” caused him pain between
starts, the New York Daily News reported.  “Yeah, you have to be concerned because like I’ve said,
I’ve never had any problems with the elbow before,” Sabathia
said yesterday, according to the newspaper. “It’s something
that I’ve not felt before, never had, so it’s best to go get it
checked out and go from there.”  The 32-year-old Major League Baseball pitcher will see Dr.
James Andrews, who saw the player when he was on the disabled
list with elbow swelling Aug. 9-23. General Manager Brian Cashman said he wasn’t concerned, calling the appointment “a
follow-up,” the newspaper reported.  Sabathia has pitched with a bone spur in the left elbow
since he played for the Cleveland Indians, the newspaper said,
citing a person familiar with the situation.  Sabathia was 15-6 with 197 strikeouts last season. He was
2-0 against the Baltimore Orioles in the American League
Divisional Series, and 0-1 in the AL Championship Series when
the Detroit Tigers swept the Yankees 4 games to none.  To contact the reporter on this story:
