U.S. stocks are beating every major asset class for the first time in 17 years even as economic growth weakens and profits rise at the slowest rate since 2009.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has  rallied  14 percent in 2012, beating Treasuries, corporate bonds, commodities, the dollar and equities in Asia and Europe, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The last time that happened, in 1995, the  S&P 500  was posting the biggest  annual advance  of the last five decades. With a price-earnings ratio close to today’s level, the index gained another 93 percent in the next 2 1/2 years.  For all the concern about  unemployment  and manufacturing growth, the best assets this year remain American companies after unprecedented steps by the  Federal Reserve  to support growth. Forecasts for a rebound in the U.S. economy and the central bank’s pledge to keep  interest rates  near zero for years convinced bulls the S&P 500 will extend gains. Bears say political gridlock will drag down prices after monetary stimulus wears off.  “We see good earnings growth and improving economic outlook, we see good equity valuations and easy monetary policy, we see skeptical investors and low positioning in equity assets,” said  Max King , a multi-asset strategist at Investec Asset Management in London, which oversees $100 billion. “This is a major green light for equities and the fact that people don’t see it, is great.”  Treasury Returns  Treasuries have returned 3.3 percent in 2012, compared with 9.9 percent for U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds and 14 percent for high-yield debt, based on Barclays Plc index data. The S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities advanced 1.7 percent, while the  Dollar Index (DXY)  that measures the U.S. currency against those of six trading partners weakened 0.7 percent.  The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent  last week  to 1,433.19 following better-than-estimated data on U.S. housing starts and as earnings from Citigroup Inc.,  Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  and Mattel Inc. topped forecasts. Including dividends, the index is up 16 percent this year,  led by  PulteGroup Inc., Sprint Nextel Co. and Gap Inc., which have risen more than 96 percent. The S&P 500 added 0.1 percent to 1,434.16 at 10:03 a.m.  New York  time.  The  bull market  will last another year as individuals regain confidence and return to equities after withdrawing money since 2007, according to Laszlo Birinyi, the president of Birinyi Associates Inc. in Westport, Connecticut. Investors have pulled about $100 billion from U.S. stock funds this year and added $250 billion to bond funds, according to data from the Investment Company Institute in Washington.  ‘Better Shape’  “I don’t think you’ve seen the signs of a frothy, toppy market,” Birinyi, who traded equities at Salomon Brothers Inc. in the 1980s, said in an Oct. 17 phone interview. “People are realizing that the stock market is not all that bad. It’s been telling us that the economy and companies are in better shape than people think.”  Shares worldwide rallied this year as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said July 26 the bank would step up its fight to save the euro and bring down record borrowing costs in Spain and Italy.  The Fed initiated a third phase of so-called quantitative easing on Sept. 13 to purchase $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities per month and said that it will keep interest rates near record lows at least through mid-2015.  The U.S. recovery is the weakest post-recession expansion since World War II, according to Bloomberg data, and the International Monetary Fund  forecasts  gross domestic product around the world will expand 3.3 percent this year, the slowest since the 2009 recession.  Leader Board  While the S&P 500 is outperforming broader indexes, nine national markets among 24 developed nations tracked by Bloomberg have gained more.  Germany’s DAX Index (DAX)  has jumped 25 percent as investors raised expectations policymakers will solve Europe’s debt crisis. The Athens Stock Exchange General Index soared 28 percent on optimism Greece will reach a deal with the IMF and European partners to remain in the  euro zone . Silver, corn and platinum have risen at least 15 percent.  Bears say the support of central banks can only do so much. They also note that the so-called fiscal cliff, the more than $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts that are set to kick in automatically next year unless Congress breaks a deadlock, is weighing on investors deciding which assets to buy.  ‘Moving Up’  “I’d rather have things be moving up as a result of fundamentals than a very aggressive central bank,” Jason Brady, a managing director at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management Inc., which oversees about $83 billion, said in an Oct. 18 phone interview. “You’re looking at a bunch of companies in situations where there are a lot of headwinds and a real difficulty of getting growth.”  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  reported results last week that showed the global economic slowdown is prompting companies to curtail technology spending. The stocks have fallen every day since releasing quarterly earnings, with Intel down 2.5 percent in the first trading session and  IBM losing  4.9 percent, the biggest loss since October 2009.  General Electric Co. (GE) , the biggest maker of power-generation equipment, fell 3.4 percent on Oct. 19 when it reported revenue that missed analyst estimates and cut its 2012 sales target. It was the  second quarter  in a row of lower-than-projected sales, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Jobless Rate  While the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly declined to 7.8 percent in September, payroll growth slowed, a Labor Department report showed on Oct. 5. Companies added 114,000 workers last month after a revised 142,000 gain in August, according to government data.  Reports on the world’s largest economy beat forecasts last month. U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly expanded in September after three months of contraction while service industries grew by the most in six months, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed this month.  “The negative case is always more compelling,” Birinyi said. “It’s always more rational because the negative case is about now. The stock market is about tomorrow.”  S&P 500 earnings may rise 4.7 percent this year to $101 per share, the highest on record, according to the average prediction among Wall Street equity strategists. While the growth rate is about a third of  the pace  in 2011 and the slowest since 2009, profits have already expanded an average 23 percent a quarter since the start of 2010. They’re projected to pick up in 2013, increasing 5.7 percent, the data show. For the 117 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly results so far, earnings are exceeding estimates by 4 percent on average, while sales are increasing 1.8 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Record Predicted  Wall Street strategists tracked by Bloomberg predict the S&P 500 may surpass its all-time high next year. The benchmark may end 2013 at 1,585, according to the median forecast of five analysts polled by  Bloomberg News , 1.3 percent higher than a record in October 2007.  The improvement in the  U.S. economy  and signs Europe’s debt crisis may be easing made Treasuries less attractive than equities this year. The yield on the benchmark  10-year bond  fell to 1.38 percent on July 25, according to Bloomberg data, a record low. It finished last week at 1.76 percent, from 1.88 percent at the end of 2011.  Bond Returns  Barclays Plc’s 10-20 Year Treasury Total Return Index has climbed 3.3 percent this year. The Barclays Municipal Bond Index has advanced 6.1 percent, while a gauge of  Treasury inflation- indexed notes  known as TIPS added 6.3 percent.  Debt issued by companies, loans and  hedge funds  also trailed stocks. A Barclays index of investment-grade  U.S. corporate debt  has gained 9.9 percent in 2012 and a  gauge  of high-yield credit advanced almost 14 percent. The S&P Leveraged Loan 100 Total Return Index is up 9.7 percent this year, while the HFRI Hedge Fund-Weighted Composite Index added 4.8 percent .  The S&P GSCI commodity index is poised for its smallest annual advance since plunging in 2008. China expanded 7.4 percent last quarter, the lowest pace in more than three years, the government said Oct. 18. A slowdown in the world’s second- biggest economy and largest consumer of raw materials is putting pressure on the ruling Communist Party to add stimulus, fueling confidence the country will avoid a hard landing and boost world economic growth.  Emerging Markets  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) , which tracks stocks in 21 developing nations including China, Brazil and Russia, has climbed 9.8 percent, and the  Euro Stoxx 50 Index (SX5E)  for the 17- nation euro area is up 9.7 percent.  The 34 percent rally for the S&P 500 in 1995 was the biggest gain in 37 years. The U.S. equity benchmark traded at an average 16.6 times reported earnings and rose more than 19 percent annually through 1999 as economic growth boosted profits and investors snapped up new-technology businesses. The index ended last week with a price-earnings multiple of 14.5, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Equities remain cheap compared with other assets, according to Alan Higgins, who helps oversee $48 billion for Coutts & Co.  Profits for S&P 500 companies represent 6.9 percent of the index’s price, compared with a yield of 2.7 percent on investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds, according to Bloomberg and Barclays data. The spread of 4.2 percentage points compares with an all-time high of 4.6 points in 2011, the data show.  “Equities still stand out either as attractive or reasonably valued, so we are more likely to invest there,” Higgins, the London-based securities firm’s chief investment officer for the U.K., said in a phone interview on Oct. 18. He cut investments in credit last week. “They are more likely to take the lead based on current valuations.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Alexis Xydias in London at   axydias@bloomberg.net ; Whitney Kisling in New York at   wkisling@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrew Rummer at   arummer@bloomberg.net ; Lynn Thomasson at   lthomasson@bloomberg.net
