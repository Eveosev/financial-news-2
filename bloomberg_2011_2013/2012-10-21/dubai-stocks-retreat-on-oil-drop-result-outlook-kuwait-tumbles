Kuwaiti stocks fell the most since
2009 after the government amended the electoral system,
prompting calls by the opposition for more protests and a
boycott of the elections. Dubai’s index declined.  Construction company  Combined Group Contracting Co. (CGC) 
decreased 4.4 percent.  National Mobile Telecommunications Co. (NMTC) ,
the company known as Wataniya, fell the most since June.
 Kuwait’s Stock Exchange Price Index (KWSEIDX)  tumbled 3.1 percent, the
most since July 2009, to 5,729.38 at the close in  Kuwait  City.
Dubai’s benchmark lost the most in a week.  Kuwait’s cabinet yesterday issued draft decrees setting
Dec. 1 as election day and amending the voting system by
reducing the number of candidates each voter can elect to one
from four. Opposition groups have called for a mass protest
tonight against the amendments. The opposition and a number of
former lawmakers said they would boycott the parliamentary
elections, Kuwait’s second in less than a year.  “In the past two years, the Kuwaiti market has relied
mainly on small players, they run away the quickest as soon as
there’s some political instability and that’s what happened
today,” said Fouad Darwish, head of brokerage at Kuwait-based
Global Investment House KSCC by phone. “They won’t take any
additional risks.”  Four people have been detained since Oct. 16, when a
demonstration by the opposition turned violent and protesters
clashed with security forces. Thousands of people had assembled
outside parliament in  Kuwait City  to protest what the opposition
said was an attempt by the government to amend the election law
to weaken their chances at the polls.  ‘Investment Levels’  About 843 million shares were traded in Kuwait today,
compared with a  12-month daily average  of about 523 million. The
benchmark’s 14-day relative index slumped from 44 on Oct. 18 to
25 today. A reading below 30 indicates to some investors that a
security is poised to gain. Bader Al-Saad, the head of the
 Kuwait Investment Authority , said in remarks to al-Arabiya that
share prices are now at “investment levels.”  Combined Group declined for the first time since Oct. 16 to
1,300 fils. Wataniya dropped 2.5 percent, the most since June 3,
to 2,360 fils.  Dubai’s measure lost 0.3 percent to 1,649.69 after oil
declined and amid investor concern companies in the emirate may
report lower third-quarter results. Builder  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) ,
which has the fourth-heaviest weighting on Dubai’s gauge, may
post a  58 percent  drop in profit for the three months ended
Sept. 30, according to the mean estimate of five analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. The shares lost 1.2 percent.  Oil Drops  “Investors are waiting on more clarity for third-quarter
results and 1,650 is a level of strong resistance,” said Nabil Rantisi, managing director of brokerage at Abu Dhabi-based
Menacorp. A decline in international markets also pushed stocks
lower, he said.  Crude oil for November delivery tumbled 2.2 percent, the
most in more than two weeks, to $90.05 a barrel on Oct. 19 in
 New York , as  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  General Electric Co. (GE)  missed
quarterly sales forecasts, raising concern that slowing economic
growth will reduce oil demand. Kuwait,  Saudi Arabia  and four
other members in the Gulf Cooperation Council supply about a
fifth of the world’s oil. The  Standard and Poor’s 500 Index  fell
1.7 percent, the most since June, to 1,433.19 at the end of last
week.  The Tadawul All Share Index fell 0.4 percent. Oman’s  MSM30
Index (MSM30)  and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  slipped less than 0.1 percent, while
 Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  was little changed. Bahrain’s  BB
All Share Index (BHSEASI)  declined 0.4 percent. In North Africa, the  EGX
30 Index (EGX30)  lost 1.5 percent, the most since Oct. 8.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  declined 1.5 percent to 1,199.19, the
lowest close since Sept. 27. The yield on the 5.5 percent
benchmark Mimshal Shiklit government bonds due January 2022 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.07 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
