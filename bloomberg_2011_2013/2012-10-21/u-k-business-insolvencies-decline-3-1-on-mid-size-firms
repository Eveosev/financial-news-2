The number of U.K. business
insolvencies fell in September as failures at mid-size companies
declined,  Experian Plc (EXPN)  said.  Insolvencies slid 3.1 percent from a year earlier to 1,679
companies, affecting 0.08 percent of all businesses last month,
the Dublin-based Experian said today in a statement.
Bankruptcies at firms with 26 to 50 employees dropped 16 percent
to 92 companies, with 0.19 percent of businesses of that size
affected compared with 0.23 percent a year earlier.  Data released this week may show the U.K. exited a
recession in the third quarter, with economists in a Bloomberg
News survey  forecasting  expansion of 0.6 percent compared with
the previous three months. Still, the recovery may be restrained
by the euro-area sovereign-debt crisis and the U.K. government’s
fiscal squeeze.  “Larger firms experienced a slight increase in
insolvencies” in September, “which may lead to smaller firms
that were supplying to them experiencing a knock on effect,”
Max Firth, managing director of Experian’s U.K. and Ireland
business-information unit, said in the statement. “This
highlights the need for firms need to be prudent and consider
their credit management practices in order to survive.”  Building-company insolvencies were unchanged at 232 cases
last month, affecting 0.14 percent of businesses in the sector
compared with 0.17 percent a year earlier, Experian said. The
plastics and rubber industry had the highest failure rate at
0.28 percent, followed by the health and household industry with
0.23 percent.  Across all sectors, companies with 51 to 100 employees
posted a 7.3 percent increase in insolvencies to 44 cases, with
the proportion affected rising to 0.16 percent from 0.15
percent.  Scotland  and southwest  England  had the lowest rates of
insolvency in Britain, at 0.06 percent of businesses affected in
each region, according to Experian. Insolvency numbers in
Yorkshire and southeast England increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
