Jockey Frankie Dettori won’t be
retained next year by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s Godolphin training set-up.  He will continue to ride for the stable on a freelance
basis, Godolphin said  on its website .  The Italian has been with Godolphin for 18 years and ridden
nine English classic winners. He also partnered Dubai Millennium
to victory in the 2000 Dubai  World Cup .  “We have had a tremendous association with Frankie over
many years,” Godolphin’s racing manager Simon Crisford said on
the website. “However, Frankie is looking for a fresh challenge
and we felt that the retainer was not really working, so this is
the  best way forward. We have had many great days together and
we look forward to working with Frankie in the future and
hopefully enjoying more success together.”  Dettori said Godolphin had been a “major part” of his
achievements in racing.  “I have loved every minute of it,” he said. “I feel the
time has come for a change. My position in the stable has
changed a little bit and I need a new challenge.”  Mickael Barzalona and Silvestre de Sousa will be
Godolphin’s retained riders next year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
