Tommy Gainey  had to wait more than
two hours to celebrate his first U.S.  PGA Tour  title at the
McGladrey Classic, where his final-round, 10-under-par 60 gave
him a one-shot win over  David Toms .  Gainey, a former contestant on the Golf Channel reality
show “The Big Break,” entered yesterday in a tie for 29th
place, seven shots behind co-leaders Jim Furyk and  Davis Love III . Gainey, who’s known as “Two Gloves” because he wears a
glove on each hand, then made eight birdies and an eagle to
surge atop the leaderboard and break the course record at Sea
Island Resort in Georgia.  Gainey, 37, missed a chance to become the sixth player to
shoot 59 in a PGA Tour event when his 19-foot birdie putt came
up just short on the 18th hole. Afterwards, Gainey sat around
the clubhouse waiting for the final groups to finish and
wondering if his four-round score of 16-under 264 would hold up.  “I shot 60 and you got  Jim Furyk , Davis Love III and David
Toms, Hall-of-Famers and future Hall-of-Famers, chasing me,”
Gainey said at a news conference. “I was just looking at my
phone replying to text messages. I was waiting. I was nervous.
It just worked out for me.”  Gainey is the third golfer to shoot 60 in the final round
of a PGA Tour event, joining Grant Waite at the 1996 Phoenix
Open and Steve Lowery at the 1997 Buick Challenge. Gainey
yesterday scored a three on seven consecutive holes starting on
No. 11, a run that was highlighted by his 40-foot chip-in for
eagle at the par-5 15th.  ‘Hot Putter’  “I got hot and had a hot putter, and I rode it out,”
added Gainey, who had one top-10 finish in 30 previous PGA Tour
starts this season. “It feels like I’m in a dream. So I’m just
waiting for somebody to slap me up side the head or pinch me or
something to wake me up.”  Furyk shot a 69 yesterday to finish third at 14-under par
while Love closed with a 71 to tie for fourth.  The PGA Tour completes its Fall Series with the $4.7
million Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals Classic in Lake
Buena Vista, Florida, from Nov. 8-11.  This week,  Tiger Woods  is among about 30 PGA Tour players
who head to  Kuala Lumpur  for the $6.1 million CIMB Classic,
while the World Golf Championships-HSBC Champions is held the
following week in Guangdong, China.  Bo  Van Pelt  warmed up for the defense of his CIMB Classic
title this week by winning the inaugural Perth International
yesterday as the European Tour returned to Australia for the
first time since 2009.  Van Pelt, 37, claimed his first title of 2012 by holding
off fellow American  Jason Dufner , a two-time winner on the PGA
Tour this year, by two shots at Lake Karrinyup. He earned
256,585 euros ($334,000) for his fourth career victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
