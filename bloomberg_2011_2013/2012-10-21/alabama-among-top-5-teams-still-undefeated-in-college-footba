A.J. McCarron threw for four
touchdowns for the No. 1 University of  Alabama  which led the top
five ranked college football teams to undefeated records heading
into the eighth week of play.  In games involving the top ten Bowl Championship Series
ranked teams yesterday, it was No. 1 Alabama 44,  Tennessee  13;
No. 2 Florida 44, No. 7 South Carolina 11; No. 3 Oregon 43,
 Arizona  State 21; No. 4 Kansas State 55, No. 13 West Virginia
14; No. 5 Notre Dame 17, Brigham Young 14.  Also playing were No. 6 Louisiana State 24, No. 18 Texas
A&M 19; No. 8 Oregon State 21, Utah 7; No. 9 Oklahoma 52, Kansas
7; and No. 10 Southern California 50,  Colorado (COL)  6.  “We just kept grinding and grinding,” Alabama coach Nick
Saban told reporters. “We squandered a few opportunities at
times, but I think the key to the drill was just keep playing
and play the next play. Compete and be relentless in how you do
it.”  McCarron completed 17 of 22 passing attempts for 306 yards
as the Crimson Tide recorded its seventh victory of the season
at Nayland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee.  McCarron connected on a 23-yard scoring pass to Amari
Cooper in the first quarter and a one-yard pass to  Michael
Williams  in the second quarter.  “We set the tone and we stayed on it,” McCarron said.
“We never let up, and that was the biggest thing coach keeps
preaching.”  Cooper scored on a 42-yard pass from McCarron in the third
quarter and Kenny Bell grabbed a 39-yard pass for a touchdown in
the fourth quarter. T.J. Yeldon added touchdowns on runs on one
yard and 43 yards.  Michael Palardy kicked field goals of 32 and 21 yards for
the Volunteers (3-4), while A.J. Johnson rushed two yards for a
touchdown.  Tyler Bray passed for 184 yards on 13 of 27 attempts and
was intercepted twice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
