John Farrell has returned to the
Boston Red Sox as Bobby Valentine’s successor after spending the
past two years as manager of the Toronto Blue Jays.  Farrell was the Red Sox pitching coach from 2007-10 before
joining the Blue Jays, who had a 154-170 record during his
tenure. The Red Sox had pursued Farrell, 50, without success
last year after Terry Francona’s departure.  “I’m extremely excited to be returning to the Red Sox,”
Farrell, who signed a three-year contract, said in an e-mailed
statement. “It’s a great franchise in a  special (SPEC)  city and
region, with great fans, and we want nothing more than to reward
their faith in us.”  Blue Jays General Manager Alex Anthopoulos said Farrell
told him about two weeks ago that he wanted to return to Boston.
Because Farrell still had one year left on his contract in
Toronto, the Red Sox had to send shortstop Mike Aviles to the
Blue Jays as compensation and got right-handed pitcher David Carpenter in return.  “This was, as John explained it to me, a dream job for
him, an opportunity he really wanted to pursue,” Anthopoulos
said yesterday on conference call. “So we felt if there was a
deal that made sense for our club as well, we were going to try
to go ahead and complete that.”  Farrell is the seventh manager in Major League Baseball
history to be acquired by one team while under contract with
another, while it’s the fifth time compensation has been
required in a trade for a manager,  Boston  said in its statement.  Losing Season  The Red Sox fired Valentine on Oct. 4 after the team
finished the season 69-93, its worst record since a 62-100 mark
in 1965. It was Boston’s first losing season since 1997.  When the Red Sox pursued Farrell a year ago,  MLB.com said 
the only way the Blue Jays would have considered letting him go
with two years left on his contract would be if Boston had given
up pitcher Clay Buchholz as compensation.  “I probably don’t even want to go down the path of last
year,” Anthopoulos said. ‘There’s enough that’s gone on this
offseason with this transaction. I’m not looking to add more to
this story or another dynamic. Obviously, it’s been a story that
started last year, it died, and then it continued I guess in the
month of August.’’  Under Farrell, the Blue Jays finished 81-81 in 2011 and
73-89 in 2012. Toronto finished four games ahead of the last-
place Red Sox in the American League East Division.  Red Sox pitchers led the AL with a combined 3.87 earned run
average in Farrell’s first year as pitching coach. They also led
the league in strikeouts in 2008 and 2010, and posted the third-
best ERA in the league from 2007-10, the team said.  ‘Exceptional Leadership’  “John has been a major league pitcher, front office
executive, coach and manager,” Red Sox General Manager  Ben Cherington  said in a statement. “His broad set of experiences
and exceptional leadership skills make him the ideal person to
lead our team.”  Prior to joining the Red Sox in 2007, Farrell spent five
years as director of player development for the Cleveland
Indians.  Aviles, 31, played 136 games for the Red Sox in 2012, when
he had a .250 batting average with 13 home runs and 60 runs
batted in.  Carpenter, 27, is 1-5 with one save and a 5.70 ERA in his
MLB career. He appeared in 33 games in 2012, including 30 with
the Houston Astros prior to being sent to the Blue Jays on July
20 in a 10-player trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
