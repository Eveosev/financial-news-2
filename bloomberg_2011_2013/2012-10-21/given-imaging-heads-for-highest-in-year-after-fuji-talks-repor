Given Imaging Ltd. (GIVN)  headed for the
highest close in more than a year after Calcalist reported
 Japan ’s Fujinon Corp. is in talks to buy the company, valuing it
34 percent above last week’s close.  Shares of the Israeli maker of a capsule-sized camera for
diagnosing digestive ailments climbed 8 percent to 75.38 shekels
at 12:20 p.m. in Tel Aviv, poised for the highest close since
July 2011. The shares earlier rose as much as 17 percent.  Fujinon, a unit of  Fujifilm Holdings Corp. (4901) , is in talks to
buy Given Imaging at a valuation of $750 million, Calcalist
reported, without saying how it obtained the information. Given
Imaging rose 22 percent last week in the U.S., giving it a
market value of $561.3 million, after saying it’s been
approached about a possible takeover.  Given Imaging is exploring strategic options including a
possible merger or sale and Barclays Plc is helping it in the
process, the company said in a statement on Oct. 18. The board
of the Yokneam-based company appointed a committee to oversee
the process. Given Imaging is held indirectly by Israeli
billionaire Nochi Dankner’s IDB Holding Corp.  A spokeswoman for IDB declined to comment on the Calcalist
report. Messages left at Barclays’ Israel offices weren’t
returned today.  IDB has been selling assets, including a stake in Clal
Industries & Investments Ltd. to Russian billionaire Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries Holdings Inc., as the company
seeks to avoid default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
