John Farrell will leave the Toronto
Blue Jays to return to the Boston Red Sox as manager, the Boston
Globe reported without saying where it got the information.  Farrell, 50, who received a three-year deal, will be
introduced tomorrow or the next day as the replacement for Bobby Valentine, the Globe said. Valentine was fired after his only
season with the franchise yielded a 69-93 record, its worst in
47 years.  The Blue Jays will receive infielder Mike Aviles as
compensation for Farrell, the Globe said.  Farrell was the Red Sox’s pitching coach from 2007-10
before he became manager of the Blue Jays, who accumulated a
154-170 record under him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
