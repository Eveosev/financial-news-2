PG&E Corp. (PCG)  said its Diablo Canyon
nuclear plant near  Los Angeles  is operating normally after an
earthquake late Saturday prompted the company to declare an
“unusual event.”  PG&E ended the event at 11:42 a.m. today after conducting
inspections of the site and determining the earthquake had no
effect on plant equipment and operations, the company said in an
e-mailed statement. The designation is the lowest of four
emergencies classified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
and doesn’t require action by the public or government.  A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck late Saturday outside
King City, California, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) north of
Diablo Canyon, according to a U.S. Geological Survey report. The
plant has two units which produce a combined 2,300 megawatts,
San Francisco-based PG&E said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
