$15.7 million, since Sept. 1, the association said today in its
weekly bulletin. Exports in the latest week included 96 tons of
the Giza 88 variety and 470 tons of Giza 86, it said.  Egypt produces the worldâ€™s  finest (FINE)  extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and India
