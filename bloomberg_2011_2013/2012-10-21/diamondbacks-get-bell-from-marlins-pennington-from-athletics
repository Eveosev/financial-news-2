The  Arizona  Diamondbacks acquired
reliever  Heath Bell  from the  Miami Marlins  and infielder Cliff Pennington from the  Oakland Athletics .  The Diamondbacks also got Pennington and minor league
infielder Yordy Cabrera from Oakland for outfielder  Chris Young 
and $500,000, and then sent Cabrera to the Marlins for Bell.  “We’ve addressed two needs today,” Arizona General
Manager Kevin Towers said, according to MLB.com. “We knew we
had an abundance of outfielders, and we wanted to add another
strong arm in the pen, and we wanted to add some depth to the
middle of the infield.”  Arizona also exercised a $6.5 million option on closer J.J. Putz, the Major League Baseball team said. Putz (1-5) had 32
saves last year in 57 games pitched.  Bell, who signed a three-year, $27 million contract with
the Marlins, eventually lost his closer’s job in Miami,
finishing the season with 19 saves and a 5.09 earned run average
in 73 appearances.  “In my mind, as well as I know him, since the velocity is
still good and he’s still got the good rotation on the breaking
ball, I think changing scenery and getting back into hopefully a
comfortable environment for him, I think he’ll be strong,” said
Tower who acquired Bell for the  San Diego Padres  when he was
general manager in 2006, according to MLB.com.  Bell’s contract calls for $9 million in 2013 and 2014, and
his $9 million option for 2015 is guaranteed if he finishes 55
games in 2014 or combines to finish 100 games between 2013-14,
MLB.com said.  Pennington, 28, who can help with the shortstop position
since Stephen Drew left, hit .215 in 462 plate appearances last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
