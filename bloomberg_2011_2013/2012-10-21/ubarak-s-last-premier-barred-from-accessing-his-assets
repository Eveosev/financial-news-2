The Egyptian government barred Ahmed
Shafik, who served as ousted President  Hosni Mubarak ’s last
premier, from accessing his assets, the Justice Ministry said
today in a faxed statement. The decision, announced by Deputy
Justice Minister Yehya Galal, also affects Shafik’s three
daughters, the statement said.  Shafik, who left  Egypt  after narrowly losing the
presidential run-off race to Islamist Mohamed Mursi earlier this
year, is being investigated on a number of corruption-related
charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
