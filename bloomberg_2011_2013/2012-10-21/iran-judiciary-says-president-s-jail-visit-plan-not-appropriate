Iran’s judiciary hasn’t agreed to a
request by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to visit a Tehran
prison where his aide is detained, saying the move wouldn’t be
“appropriate,” the state-run  Mehr  news agency reported.  “Given the  special (SPEC)  situation we’re in, the nation’s
priorities, in particular economic issues, we need to focus our
concerns and efforts on these matters and not those of secondary
importance,” Prosecutor-General Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei,
whose office is part of the judiciary, was cited as saying today
by Mehr. “Visiting a prison in this context is trivial.”  In a letter to the head of the judiciary published in full
by the state-run  Iranian Students News Agency  yesterday,
Ahmadinejad requested permission to visit the Evin prison “at
the earliest time possible.” The president wrote that he had
intended to visit early this month but was asked to postpone his
trip by “days.”  Ali Akbar Javanfekr, a press adviser and close aide to
Ahmadinejad, was imprisoned on Sept. 26 on charges of insulting
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The move highlights
criticism of the outgoing president that has grown as
international sanctions against  Iran ’s nuclear program have hurt
the economy. Ahmadinejad is in the last of his two terms as
president and will be succeeded by the winner of the June
election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
