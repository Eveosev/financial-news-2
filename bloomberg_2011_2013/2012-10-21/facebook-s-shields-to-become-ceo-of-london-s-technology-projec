Joanna Shields,  Facebook (FB)  Inc.’s vice
president for Europe, Middle East and  Africa , will leave the
U.S. company and join a project to create a technology hub in
London, according to the U.K. government.  Shields will become chief executive officer at the Tech
City Investment Organisation as of January, the Department for
Business and Innovation Skills said in a posting on its  website 
today. She will also take up a position as business ambassador
for U.K.’s digital industries and will be the chairman of the
Tech City Advisory Group, according to the statement.  “Joanna’s experience will be hugely valuable in supporting
Tech City,” British Prime Minister David Cameron said in the
statement.  The Tech City Investment Organisation was created in April
last year to support the growth of a cluster of technology
companies in East London. The Tech City Advisory Group, formed
by entrepreneurs, investors and academics, was established to
help the U.K. government develop the project.  “This country has the potential to become a major force in
digital innovation,” Shields said in the statement. “The seeds
have been sown in East London for a dynamic and successful
cluster. We have the infrastructure, the technology and the
talent, now we need to accelerate the growth.”  Prior to joining Facebook, Shields was president at  AOL
Inc. (AOL) , responsible for social and communications businesses. She
has also served as  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s managing director for Europe,
 Russia , Middle East and Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
