Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said Petroliam Nasional Bhd. still has the opportunity
to negotiate with government officials to salvage its rejected
C$5.2 billion ($5.23 billion) bid for  Progress Energy Resources
Corp. (PRQ)   “I’m sure they will continue to work on it, there is
another period of time during which they can continue to have
discussions and try to satisfy the concerns that the department
of industry has,” Flaherty said on an interview with the  CTV
television network  today.  Industry Minister Christian Paradis said late on Oct. 19
that the bid had been rejected because the offer by the
Malaysian state-owned company wasn’t in Canada’s national
interests. Petronas has 30 days to appeal or provide additional
concessions, at which point the government will make a final
decision, according to the statement by Paradis.  “We have made it clear; we believe in foreign direct
investment in  Canada ,” Flaherty told CTV. “The proposals have
to be correct, and certain conditions from time to time will be
proposed by the minister of industry and it’s his
responsibility, and I think that’s what’s going on in this
particular application.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
