     Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co. is making headway
on implementing its alliance with PSA  Peugeot (UG)  Citroen, Chief
Executive Officer Dan Akerson said in an interview.  “There is progress,” Akerson said yesterday in  Sao Paulo ,
ahead of this week’s auto show.  GM said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission it wants to sign agreements with Peugeot on product-
development, vehicle-supply and powertrain-supply plans by the
end of October.  “There is a milestone on the 31st of October,” he said.
“It’s fair to say we’ll have something to comment publicly on
by that.” The deadline allows for postponement, Akerson said in
the interview.  Efforts to iron out details of the GM-Peugeot alliance
slowed amid a worsening European auto market and regulatory
review, people familiar with the matter have said.  The automakers have already missed a June 30 deadline on a
parts-buying plan. GM announced a logistics agreement with PSA
on July 2, more than two months after the  April (APR)  30 deadline set
out in the automakers’ Feb. 29 master agreement filed with the
SEC.  A GM-PSA purchasing announcement may come before the end of
this month or in early November, Akerson told reporters at a
media event.  Peugeot Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin said last
month at the Paris auto show that while a joint purchasing
agreement requires regulatory approval, it should be achieved in
November.  GM gained 0.1 percent to $24.62 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
