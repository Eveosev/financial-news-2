Batsman Jonathan Trott left
England’s tour of  Australia  because of a “stress-related”
illness, and will take a break from the sport, the  England and
Wales Cricket Board  said.  Trott, batting at No. 3, scored 10 and nine in his two
innings in  Brisbane  last week as England lost the first Test
match of the Ashes tour by 381 runs.  “I don’t feel it is right that I’m playing knowing I’m not
100 percent and I cannot currently operate at the level I have
done in the past,” Trott, 32, said, according to the ECB’s
website. “My priority now is to take a break from cricket so
that I can focus on my recovery.”  Trott averaged 46.5 runs in 49 Test matches since 2009,
according to the  ESPN Cricinfo  website.  England  won its last three Test series against Australia.
It hasn’t claimed four in a row since winning the opening eight
series after the contest began in 1882.  The next Ashes Test starts on Dec. 5 in Adelaide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
