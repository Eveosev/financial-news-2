Invel Real Estate Partners  agreed to
buy most of  National Bank of Greece SA ’s real estate unit for
653 million euros ($882 million), betting on a recovery in the
country’s economy.  The sale of the 66 percent stake in Pangaea Real Estate
Investment Co. is expected to be completed by the end of the
year, according to a statement from London-based Invel today.
Pangaea will probably have more than 1 billion euros of real
estate assets at that time and it would be the largest ever
Greek property transaction, Invel said.  The investment “demonstrates our confidence in the
potential of this market and the recovery of the  Greek
economy ,” Christophoros Papachristophorou, Invel’s founder and
managing partner, said in the statement.  Greece  is striving to attract foreign investment as the
economy faces a sixth straight year of contraction. Pangaea,
Greece’s largest real estate investment company, owns and
manages nearly all of National Bank of Greece’s branches as well
as the main offices used by the bank, the country’s oldest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
