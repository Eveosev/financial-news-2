The Congress of South African Trade
Unions, an ally of the ruling African National Congress, is at
risk of losing its biggest affiliate amid a leadership crisis.  The National Union of Metalworkers is holding talks on
whether to form a breakaway labor group and drop its support for
the ANC in next year’s election, the union’s national treasurer,
Mphumzi Maqungo, said in a phone interview today.  The 323,000-member Numsa has opposed a decision by Cosatu
leaders to suspend Secretary General Zwelinzima Vavi after he
admitted to having an extra-marital affair with a subordinate.
Vavi, a critic of the ANC’s economic policies, has said his
suspension is part of a political plot to weaken Cosatu.  “Yes, we are discussing the possibility of forming a
political labor movement outside of the alliance if it were to
come to that,” Mphumzi said. “We still have to conduct
research. It won’t happen overnight.”  Numsa is considering withdrawing its support of the ANC to
protest against the government’s economic policies, including a
decision to toll major roads around Johannesburg and allow so-called labor brokers to continue to operate.  “There are different discussions taking place internally
and we’ll decide at the special congress in December,” Mphumzi
said. “We are still calling for the ANC to rethink their
position with regards to economic policies they have
undertaken.”  The ANC-led government has pushed through a plan to levy
road users from Dec. 3 in the face of opposition from consumer
groups and Cosatu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
