Many people who should know better have been confused by the Federal Reserve's decision to pay 0.25 percent in annual interest on reserves held on deposit by member banks. Robert Hall, a senior professor at Stanford, for example, argues that " an expansion of reserves contracts the economy " when the Fed pays interest on reserves. Perhaps in response to these arguments, some people at the Fed are starting to consider reducing the interest rate they pay to banks for holding deposits at the Fed. That would be a mistake. Lowering the interest rate on reserves could destabilize the financial system, weaken the economy and inadvertently cause banks to shift to more volatile funding sources.  Two sentences in  the minutes  of the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee hint at a possible policy shift: Intriguingly, the minutes mentioned no discussion of the potential costs of lower interest rates, even though Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his presumptive successor, Janet Yellen, have both  warned  that interest rates closer to zero could disrupt short-term funding markets. (Cardiff Garcia at Alphaville cautiously suggests that the Fed's new  reverse repurchase facility  could one day be used to offset small reductions in interest paid on reserves, but is quick to note that the tool isn't ready yet.) There are other reasons to be wary of lower interest on reserves. The Financial Times reported that several bankers whom it didn't identify warned they would have to  start charging depositors fees  just to keep money in checking accounts if they lost the interest income they got from the reserves they hold at the Fed. Offering deposits isn't costless for banks, which have administrative expenses and run much of the infrastructure behind the payments system. Banks also have to pay  fees  to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. commensurate to the value of the deposits they borrow from savers. (Some at the Fed might actually be hoping for this outcome if it made  saving less attractive  compared with spending.) Even though the banks' threats are probably bluster, a lower rate of interest on reserves would still be bad for the economy. Banks would have to respond to the cut in revenue even if they didn't raise fees on depositors. They might lower salaries, raise interest rates on new loans, or engage in riskier trading strategies. Banks might also choose to reduce their reliance on deposits as a source of funding, instead preferring to raise money in the volatile capital markets. None of these things would be helpful to the broader economy. Given these known costs and the small, uncertain benefits, the Fed should avoid experimenting with the rate paid on reserves. (Matthew C.
