Volvo Cars, the Swedish automaker
owned by Chinese manufacturer Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.,
signed a second loan agreement with  China Development Bank .  The $800 million credit with a maturity in 2021 will be
used to further develop products and enhance the  capital
structure , Gothenburg, Sweden-based Volvo Cars said in a
 statement  today. The first drawdown of the loan is scheduled for
this year, with amortization and terms that match those for a
2012 loan of 922 million euros ($1.25 billion), it said.  Volvo Cars has been struggling to restore earnings since
Geely bought the manufacturer from  Ford Motor Co. (F)  in 2010 for
$1.8 billion. Chief Executive Officer Hakan Samuelsson said last
week he is confident Volvo Cars will reach break-even this year
after vehicle sales improved in the second half. Volvo has to
make up for a first-half loss stemming from declines in sales
and pricing, increased investments and currency effects.  Under the new owner, Volvo Cars laid out an ambitious
growth plan to nearly double its sales to 800,000 vehicles by
2020. Deliveries will probably remain about unchanged this year
from the 421,951 vehicles sold in 2012 and grow again next year,
Samuelsson said on Nov. 22.  Volvo Cars is developing its own vehicle underpinnings to
gain full independence from former parent Ford by 2017. Geely
and Volvo Cars are also establishing a shared engineering center
in  Sweden  to offer jointly developed vehicles by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
