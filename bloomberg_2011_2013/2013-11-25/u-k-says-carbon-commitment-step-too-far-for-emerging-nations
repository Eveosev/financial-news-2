U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Davey
comments on why emerging nations pushed to remove the word
“commitments” from a text at United Nations climate talks in
Warsaw on Nov. 23. He was speaking in an interview that day in
the Polish capital, as the negotiations were finishing.  Plan calls for nations to make “contributions” to cut
greenhouse-gas emissions instead of commitments, according to an
undated document published on the  website  of the UN Framework
Convention on  Climate Change .  The text called on nations ready to do so to communicate
post-2020 emission-limiting targets by March 2015.  On emerging nations’ stance at the talks:  Developing countries  “didn’t want to pre-judge the treaty.
The 2015 negotiation. I think they felt that if they signed up
to the commitment that they were making a commitment, a legal
obligation that they’d be bound by. That’s not quite what we
wanted. We wanted people to do their work, do their
calculations, work out what they think they could do and tell
us. We have a process by which we are going to assess the
contributions. So actually, it delivers what we need it to
deliver.”  On investors’ probable reaction to the Warsaw negotiations:  “I think investors will be pleased by this progress. We
now have a work program. We have the process. We have the
timetable. We put the nuts and bolts together.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
