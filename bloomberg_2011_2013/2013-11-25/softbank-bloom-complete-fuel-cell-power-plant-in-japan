Softbank Corp. (9984) , the Japanese
majority owner of  Sprint Corp. (S) , and Bloom Energy Corp. finished
their first joint fuel-cell project.  The project at SoftBank’s M-Tower in Fukuoka, Japan, is the
result of a joint venture the companies formed in July,
Sunnyvale, California-based Bloom said today in a statement.  The 200-kilowatt system is also the first international
project for Bloom, which has more than 100 megawatts of fuel
cells installed in the U.S. for clients such as Google Inc. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  Bloom’s fuel cells produce electricity from natural gas
through a chemical reaction that emits less carbon dioxide than
power plants that burn gas, according to its  website . The
systems also may reduce blackouts, like those that occurred in
Japan after the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, because
they don’t rely on a centralized  power grid .  To contact the reporter on this story:
