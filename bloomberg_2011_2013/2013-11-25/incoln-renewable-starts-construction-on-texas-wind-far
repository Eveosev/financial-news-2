Lincoln Renewable Energy LLC , a
developer of solar and wind energy projects, started building a
300-megawatt wind farm in northwest  Texas .  The Hereford 2 project will use the Competitive Renewable
Energy Zone transmission lines that connect the windy Texas
Panhandle to high electricity demand areas in the state,
Chicago-based Lincoln said today in a statement.  Located 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Amarillo,
Texas, in Castro County, the project will qualify for the
production tax credit for power produced from clean sources,
which was renewed for one year on Jan. 1. Lincoln is working
with Dallas-based Higher Power Energy LLC on the project.  The U.S. unit of  Electricite de France SA  agreed to buy
power from the first phase of the Hereford project under an
agreement signed in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
