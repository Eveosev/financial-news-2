Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai advanced as the government in  Hebei province  began
demolishing old steel blast furnaces.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract by volume
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, rose as much as 0.8 percent to
3,642  yuan  ($598) a metric ton and traded at 3,630 yuan at 10:49
a.m., local time.  The government in the northern province, China’s biggest
steel producing area, will reduce its annual steel output
capacity by at least 10 million metric tons through a program to
destroy furnaces that started yesterday, state-owned China
National Radio reported. The provincial government said
September it planned to cut capacity by 60 million tons by 2017
to tackle air pollution.  “We are seeing some support from the curbs in Hebei,”
said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing CIFCO Futures Co. in
Tianjin.  Rebar inventory  tracked by  Shanghai  Steelhome Information
Technology Co. dropped to 5.24 million tons last week, the
lowest since January 2011. China is the world’s biggest consumer
and producer of steel.  Iron ore  for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
rose 0.3 percent to 934 yuan a ton. The steel-making  material
 for immediate delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel
Index gained 0.2 percent to $136.5 a dry ton on Nov. 22.  Rebar for immediate delivery tracked by Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. was little changed at 3,532 yuan a
on Nov. 22.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
