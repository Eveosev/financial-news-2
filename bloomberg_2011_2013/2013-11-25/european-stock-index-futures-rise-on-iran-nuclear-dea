European  stocks  advanced, after
posting their first weekly loss since October, as Iran agreed to
limit its nuclear program.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  and  Air
France-KLM (AF)  Group rose with a gauge of travel stocks as oil
prices fell after Iran’s accord. PSA Peugeot Citroen gained 5.1
percent after people familiar with the matter said it will
appoint a new chief executive officer. Fresenius Medical Care AG
surged the most in five years after U.S. regulators scrapped a
plan to cut Medicare payments next year.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.4 percent to 324.18
at the close in London, 0.5 points away from its May 2008 high
reached Nov. 18. The benchmark gauge slipped less than 0.1
percent last week, the first loss since Oct. 4. It has surged 16
percent this year as central banks around the world maintained
stimulus measures.  “The negotiations with  Iran  have been going on for a while
and now we’re seeing some progress,” said Veronika Pechlaner,
who helps oversee about $2.3 billion as an investment manager at
 Jersey , Channel Islands-based Ashburton Ltd. “The long-term
impact of the deal could be significant. Anything that takes
pressure off of the consumer and could help accelerate a
recovery could be seen as good news. We are seeing the seasonal
period into Christmas, which is typically strong for markets.”  December Advance  The Stoxx 600  has climbed  every December since 2009. The
volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on the gauge
was 21 percent below its 30-day average today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for as
much as $7 billion in relief from economic sanctions over six
months. Iran and the six countries it has entered a pact with --
the U.S., U.K.,  Germany ,  France ,  Russia  and  China  -- aim to
conclude a comprehensive deal during that time.  The accord is the first major breakthrough in the dispute
over Iran’s nuclear program since 2003. Questions over the
purpose of that plan had deepened the rift between Shiite and
Sunni Muslims in the Middle East, sparked threats of military
action by the U.S. and  Israel , and raised concerns that the oil-rich region was heading for a nuclear arms race.  National benchmark indexes advanced in 15 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3 percent, while
France’s CAC 40 added 0.6 percent. Germany’s DAX jumped 0.9
percent.  In the U.S., the number of contracts Americans signed to
buy previously-owned homes unexpectedly fell in October for a
fifth consecutive month. An  index  of pending home sales
decreased 0.6 percent in October, following a revised 4.6
percent drop a month earlier, data from the National Association
of Realtors showed. The median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey had called for a gain of 1 percent.  Travel Companies  A gauge of travel and leisure companies gained 1.6 percent
for the  biggest jump  among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.
Brent crude futures fell as much as 2.7 percent today. IAG, the
parent of British Airways, climbed 2.8 percent to 372.8 pence
and Air France advanced 1.9 percent to 7.64 euros.  Peugeot gained 5.1 percent to 10.75 euros after two people
familiar with the matter said the board approved hiring former
 Renault SA (RNO)  Chief Operating Officer Carlos Tavares to replace
Philippe Varin as CEO. Varin, 61, plans to step down next year.
Europe’s second-largest carmaker is also likely to benefit from
the Iran accord. Peugeot sold 458,000 vehicles in Iran in 2011,
before the trade sanctions, making it the company’s second-biggest market after France.  Renault, which sold more than 100,000 vehicles in Iran in
2012, added 1.4 percent to 65.33 euros.  Medicare Payments  Fresenius Medical Care, the world’s biggest provider of
kidney dialysis, jumped 7 percent to 51.19 euros, the largest
gain since November 2008. Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a
final rule on Nov. 22 that keeps payments to companies including
Fresenius Medical Care unchanged for 2014. The original proposal
was for a 9.4 percent cut.  Fresenius SE, which owns a 31 percent stake in the dialysis
provider, climbed 3.8 percent to 102.60 euros.  Novartis AG (NOVN)  advanced 0.8 percent to 72.75 Swiss francs
after Natixis upgraded the shares to buy from neutral. The
drugmaker’s progress in research for a breast-cancer treatment
and the $5 billion share buyback announced last week will result
in higher earnings, the brokerage said in a note.  Banco Popolare SC (BP)  declined 4.2 percent to 1.28 euros and
 Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA (UBI)  slid 3.1 percent to 4.88 euros
after Societe Generale SA reduced its 12-month price forecast on
the shares.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  slipped 7.5
percent to 20 euro cents for the biggest decline in the Stoxx
600, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The French brokerage estimated that Italian banks will need
44 billion euros more in provisions for their bad loans. Italian
lenders’ non-performing loans as a proportion of lending rose in
September to the highest level since November 1999, according to
data published by the Italian Banking Association on Nov. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
