Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , the largest U.S.
utility owner, is developing three solar farms with 30 megawatts
of capacity in eastern North Carolina.  The 20-megawatt Dogwood Solar Power Project in Halifax
County and two 5-megawatt plants, Windsor Cooper Hill Solar in
Bertie County and Bethel Price Solar in Pitt County, will all be
completed this year, the company said today in a statement.  SunEnergy1, based in Mooresville, North Carolina, is
designing and building the solar farms with panels from Jiashan,
China-based ReneSola Ltd. The plants will supply enough
electricity for about 6,000 homes.  With these projects, Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke
has 20 U.S. solar farms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
