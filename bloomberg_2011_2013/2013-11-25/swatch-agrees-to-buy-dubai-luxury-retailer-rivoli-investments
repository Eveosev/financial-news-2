Swatch Group AG (UHR) , which bought the
Harry Winston watch and jewelry brand for about $1 billion in
March, agreed to take over Dubai retailer Rivoli Investments
LLC, gaining a network of 360 businesses across the  Middle East .  Swatch, based in Biel,  Switzerland , didn’t disclose the
seller’s name or financial details of the transaction that will
give it control of Rivoli, according to an e-mailed  statement 
today. Previously, it held a 40 percent stake in the retailer,
which offers Swatch timepieces for sale across its network.  The Swiss company said in July that it expects a strong
 second-half  after profit rose 6.1 percent to 768 million Swiss
francs in the first six months. The company is expanding in
markets outside Asia such as the U.S. to avoid depending too
much on that region, Chairwoman Nayla Hayek said on May 29.  Rivoli is an importer, distributor and retailer of luxury
products from watches to leather accessories in the United Arab
Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, according to its website.  Dubai International Capital , owned by ruler Sheikh Mohammed
Bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s Dubai Holding LLC, acquired a
“significant stake” in the Rivoli Group in 2007, according to
 information  on the company’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
