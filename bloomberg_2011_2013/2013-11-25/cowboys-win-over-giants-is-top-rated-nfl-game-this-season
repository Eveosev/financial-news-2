The Dallas Cowboys’ 24-21 win over
the New York Giants yesterday, which snapped a four-game New
York win streak and moved Dallas back into a share of its
division lead, drew the highest rating of the National Football
League season in the nation’s biggest cities.  The late afternoon game at MetLife Stadium in East
Rutherford, New Jersey, was seen on Fox in 18.9 percent of homes
in the top 56 metered U.S. television markets,  Lou D’Ermilio , a
spokesman for the  Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA)  network, said in
an e-mail. It was Fox’s best metered-market rating for an NFL
regular-season game since 2011.  It topped the meter-market rating of 17 for last night’s
game between the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots on NBC.
Denver took a 24-0 halftime lead before New England mounted the
biggest comeback in team history to win 34-31 in overtime. It
was the best metered-market rating for a prime-time November
game in 17 years, according to the  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  network.  Yesterday’s Cowboys-Giants outcome left New York 4-7 and
two games behind Dallas and the Philadelphia Eagles, who are
tied for the lead in the National Football Conference East at
6-5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
