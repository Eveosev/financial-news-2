Yale University  ordered a campus lockdown and told students, faculty and staff to shelter in place after reports of a person with a gun on campus.  Police in  New Haven , Connecticut, where Yale is based, received an anonymous 911 call from a phone booth earlier today, reporting a gunman, according to the school. The caller said his roommate planned to open fire on the Yale campus, according to Anna Mariotti, a city spokeswoman.  Officers from Yale, New Haven and the Connecticut state police are on the scene and are actively searching for a suspect, the school said. Teams in tactical gear have been seen outside several buildings on campus, the  Associated Press  reported.  “Out of an abundance of caution, police will be doing a room-to-room search starting with the residential college areas,” Yale told students in an alert message.  Police have received reports about a person carrying a “long gun” on the Old Campus, a section of Yale that houses dormitories, classrooms and offices, Mariotti said in an e-mail.  “It is likely that the people seen with long guns were  law enforcement ,” she said.  The university issued the “shelter in place” order at about 10:20 a.m. today,  Tom Conroy , a spokesman, confirmed. The university sent out another message before noon saying a lockdown remains in place and advised people off campus to stay away.  Most students have left Yale for Thanksgiving break, according to Conroy.
