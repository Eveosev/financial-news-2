Cotton futures jumped the most in
three months as rain hampers the harvest in parts of the U.S.,
the world’s largest exporter. Coffee and cocoa climbed, while
sugar and orange juice dropped.  U.S. Southeast areas, including parts of Georgia and
Virginia, will get as much as 3 inches (7.6 cm) of rain from
today through Nov. 27, delaying the cotton harvest and eroding
the crop quality, Drew Lerner, the president of World Weather
Inc. in  Overland Park ,  Kansas , said today in a telephone
interview.  “We’re supposed to get pretty big rains over the next few
days, and it’s causing some buying,”  Jack Scoville , a vice
president at Price Futures Group Inc. in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview.. The wet weather “could hurt some volume
and certainly will hurt the harvest progress in the coming
week,” he said.  Cotton for March delivery advanced 1.5 percent to 78.30
cents a pound at 1:25 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. A
close at that price would mark the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Aug. 16.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery gained 0.7
percent to $1.083 a pound.  Cocoa futures for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to settle
at $2,803 a metric ton.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.4 percent to
17.33 cents a pound. Earlier, the price touched 17.31 cents, the
lowest since Sept. 9.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery dropped less than
0.1 percent to $1.389 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
