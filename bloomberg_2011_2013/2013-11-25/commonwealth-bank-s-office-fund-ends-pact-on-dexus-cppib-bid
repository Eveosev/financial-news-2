Commonwealth Bank of Australia  ended
an agreement with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and
 Dexus Property Group (DXS)  on their A$2.8 billion ($2.6 billion) bid
for the bank’s office fund after the consortium failed to match
 GPT Group’s (GPT)  higher offer.  The  Commonwealth Property Office Fund’s (CPA)  manager ended the
agreement, which allowed Dexus exclusive due diligence, as it
didn’t match GPT’s competing proposal valued at A$3 billion, it
said in a regulatory filing today. Dexus can continue due
diligence on a non-exclusive basis, it said.  Today’s announcement allows GPT to begin discussions on the
fund as it fights Dexus for control of A$3.8 billion of office
buildings in  Australia ’s biggest cities. Dexus, which in July
agreed to buy a 14.9 percent stake in the fund known as CPA said
last week it won’t back GPT’s offer.  While Dexus and the Canadian fund are committed to their
bid, it’s too soon to respond to GPT’s proposal, Dexus said
separately today. The companies have entered into a new
confidentiality agreement with CPA’s manager and will continue
with due diligence, it said.  CPA shares fell 0.2 percent to A$1.2625 as of 10:53 a.m. in
Sydney. Dexus shares rose 0.7 percent to A$1.052, and GPT
securities jumped 3 percent to A$3.665, compared with a 0.6
percent gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
