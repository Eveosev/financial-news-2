Koichi Sugimoto, who oversees
automotive research at  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  in  Tokyo , is planning to
depart the company, two people familiar with the matter said.  Sugimoto, who  joined  BNP Paribas in May 2011, is poised to
leave in January, one of the people said, asking not to be
identified because the person is not authorized to discuss the
move with the media.  Excluding Sugimoto, at least five automotive analysts in
 Japan  have changed jobs since April, according to a tally by
 Bloomberg News . Other changes include Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities hiring former Citigroup Inc. Managing
Director Noriyuki Matsushima, Barclays Plc employing Tatsuo Yoshida from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley and UBS AG hiring
Kohei Takahashi from JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “The automotive industry has a large presence in Japan, so
I’m not surprised movement has come from this sector,” said
Adam Johnston, Tokyo-based managing director at  Robert Half
International Inc. , which provides professional staffing
services. “The biggest trigger is that confidence is back in
Japan,” Johnston said.  Japanese shares have climbed as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
has sought to re-energize Japan Inc. after years of deflation
and population declines reduced manufacturers’ incentive to
expand at home. The  Topix index  has gained 47 percent this year.  Prior to joining BNP Paribas, Sugimoto worked at Nomura
Holdings Inc. and Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co. He is a
graduate of  Kyoto University .  To contact the reporters on this story:
