Gasoline in New York Harbor weakened
relative to futures as  Phillips 66 (PSX)  completed maintenance at the
Bayway refinery in  New Jersey .  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, fell by 0.63
cent to a premium of 0.75 cent a gallon more than futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:54 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The 238,000-barrel-a-day refinery, the closest plant to the
delivery point for U.S. gasoline and diesel futures, finished
planned work today, Dennis Nuss, a Houston-based spokesman for
Phillips 66, said by e-mail. The refinery was to shut fuel-gas,
isomerization and catalytic cracking units in October, a person
familiar with operations said previously.  The Bayway complex operates the largest catalytic cracker
in the U.S., according to the companyâ€™s website. Catalytic
crackers convert heavy vacuum gas oil to lighter, more valuable
products, like gasoline and diesel.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in  New York , a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on Brent oil in
Europe, weakened $1.29 to $6.57 a barrel as of 2:04 p.m., the
lowest level since Oct. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
