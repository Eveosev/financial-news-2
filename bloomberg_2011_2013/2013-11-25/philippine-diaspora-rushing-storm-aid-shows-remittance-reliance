After Lyn Lyn Rael’s three-room house was swept away by Super Typhoon Haiyan, leaving her husband and five children homeless, she borrowed 25,000 pesos ($570), the equivalent of two months’ wages, from her employer in Singapore to send to her family.  “They’re all depending on me,” the 30-year-old nanny, who comes from Maghubas village in Leyte province in central Philippines, said by phone. “I had to leave the country two years ago to make money to pay for my kids’ education and for our rice farm. Now to add to it, I need to rebuild our house.”  Remittance growth  rose 3.7 percentage points in the three months after past major disasters, Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a note this month, using data from seven calamities since 2004. Annual transfers from 10.5 million overseas Filipinos like Rael are equivalent to about 10 percent of  gross domestic product , according to World Bank estimates, underscoring the nation’s reliance on these funds even with the fastest expansion among Southeast Asia’s biggest economies.  “Calamities highlight the Philippines’s dependence on remittances to finance domestic consumption, with the affected families turning to their relatives working abroad for help,” said  Trinh Nguyen , an economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong, who forecasts the funds could rise 6 percent this year. “Unless the government succeeds in creating more jobs at home, Filipinos will still need to travel abroad to have better employment opportunities and this dependence will persist.”  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index  has fallen more than 6 percent since the Nov. 8 typhoon swept away coastal towns and destroyed an entire city in the Visayas group of islands. The peso dropped about 1.5 percent in the same period.  Foreign Exchange  Damage to residential, commercial and agricultural properties is estimated at between $6.5 billion and $14.5 billion, catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide said Nov. 18. The storm left more than 5,000 dead and displaced 3.4 million.  The  World Bank  forecast in October that remittances to the Philippines will rise 5.7 percent this year to $26 billion. Overseas Filipinos rushing to send money to families affected by Haiyan will boost funds over the next few months, according to HSBC, UBS AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc.  Remittances are 9.8 percent of GDP in the Philippines, according to World Bank  estimates  that were updated in October. Based on data released by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas,  funds  sent through banks totaled more than 8 percent of  GDP  in 2012.  In the world’s third-largest recipient of remittances, the funds are the biggest source of foreign exchange after exports, and help boost local consumption, supporting sales of companies including Vista Land & Lifescapes Inc. and Jollibee Foods Corp. Remittances rose 5.8 percent in the January-to-September period from a year earlier, according to the central bank.  Nurses, Engineers  Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore  inflation  quickened in October, according to a report today. Taiwan industrial production gained 0.78 percent from a year earlier last month.  In Europe, manufacturing-industry business confidence in France was unchanged in November from the previous month. Pending home sales in the U.S. may have risen in October for the first time in five months, according to a separate survey.  The Philippines avoided a recession during the 2009 global economic slump as remittances helped counter a slide in  exports , even as neighboring economies from Singapore to Thailand contracted. The number of workers from nurses to engineers leaving the Philippines increased 12.6 percent last year to a  record  2.08 million, even as GDP grew 6.8 percent from the previous year, the fastest pace since 2010.  Economic Revival  “Philippines does depend on its remittances, which is inevitable given the economic opportunities within the country are limited,” the Asian Development Bank’s Managing Director-General  Rajat Nag  said in an interview Nov. 22. The “economy needs to get more diversified.”  Philippine President  Benigno Aquino , named by Time magazine as one of the world’s 100 most influential people this year, has overseen an  economic revival  with growth exceeding 7 percent for four straight quarters. The nation this year won investment-grade scores from Moody’s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s.  Expansion this quarter may be between 4.1 percent and 5.9 percent, Economic Planning Secretary  Arsenio Balisacan  said Nov. 14, commenting on the effects of the storm. Full-year growth will probably be 6.5 percent to 7 percent, within the government’s targeted range, he said.  The economy probably expanded 7.2 percent last quarter from a year earlier, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey ahead of a Nov. 28 report. Aquino is still struggling to create enough jobs to reduce a poverty rate that hasn’t decreased since 2006, with unemployment at 7.3 percent in July, the highest after India among 15 Asia-Pacific economies tracked by Bloomberg, based on latest available data.  “It’s painful to be away from the kids, but I have to sacrifice,” said Rael, who sends 10,000 pesos every month to help with household expenses. “I now have to repay the loan I took from my employer.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Karl Lester M.
