Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
largest social network, said retailers have increased use of an
advertising tool that lets them send promotions to their
existing customers.  The number of marketers using  Facebook ’s Custom Audiences
tool in the third quarter rose almost 75 percent from the prior
period, the company will say in a blog post today.  Facebook has been tailoring its offerings for retailers
ahead of the holiday shopping season, in a push to attract more
advertising spending with its member base of more than 1 billion
people. The Menlo Park, California-based company is asking
marketers to use Custom Audiences to promote gift ideas and
sales to consumers who are already customers, or to acquire new
shoppers by excluding existing customers from campaigns.  U.S. online holiday sales are projected to increase as much
as 15 percent to $82 billion this year, more than three times
faster than the total estimated retail gain of 3.9 percent to
$602.1 billion, according to the National Retail Federation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
