Hog futures advanced on speculation
that declining slaughter rates are signaling shrinking supplies
of animals amid increasing U.S. meatpacker demand. Cattle prices
rose.  Pork processors slaughtered an estimated 2.34 million
animals last week, a 0.1 percent decline from a week earlier,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. On Nov. 22, cash
 prices  for hogs eligible for slaughter increased 1 percent to
77.37 cents a pound, the biggest gain in three weeks, according
to the USDA.  “Demand must be pretty good, and numbers might not be
stacking up,” Dennis Smith, a senior account executive at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.6 percent to
90.175 cents a pound at 10:14 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. On Nov. 22, the contract declined 1 percent, the most
in a week.  Cattle futures for February delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$1.32025 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement fell 0.3
percent to $1.6295 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
