Banks in Europe need more
information on the  European Central Bank ’s future supervision of
their industry, said  Juergen Fitschen , the co-chief executive
officer of  Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK)   A number of details on stress testing and the exact
timetable are still open, Fitschen, who is also president of the
BdB Association of German Banks, said in a  statement  today.
These should be “sorted out as soon as possible,” as the ECB’s
assessment is “a major challenge for banks, particularly with
the necessary personnel resources in mind,” he said.  The ECB plans to carry out a three-step examination of
about 130 of the euro region’s biggest lenders before taking
over banking supervision next year. Europe’s leaders entrusted
the Frankfurt-based central bank to oversee the financial system
to restore confidence in the region’s banks after the credit
crisis of 2008 and  Europe ’s sovereign-debt debacle triggered the
continent’s worst recession since World War II.  Current regulations should be examined for their
effectiveness first, before thinking about further steps,
Fitschen said in the statement, adding that “the large number
of regulatory measures and their complexity threaten to
overburden many, especially small banks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
