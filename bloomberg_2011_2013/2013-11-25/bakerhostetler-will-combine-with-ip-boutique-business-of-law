Deutsche Bank AG, have racked up more than $77 billion in legal
costs since the financial crisis, five times their combined
profit last year.  Since September 2008, the 18 banks with the highest
litigation expenses paid at least $24.9 billion settling
lawsuits and probes, set aside $31.5 billion to compensate U.K.
clients improperly sold products including  mortgage insurance 
and earmarked $20.9 billion for further penalties, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The sum equates to spending $42 million a
day. The total may be higher as many settlements aren’t public.  European banks are meeting the cost of helping some clients
launder money and avoid taxes while cheating others by not
disclosing the risk of products designed to protect them from
interest rate swings and manipulating markets for their own
profit. The penalties come as regulators require firms to set
aside more funds to strengthen finances and as executives look
for ways to boost  shareholder returns  even amid lower revenue.  The six biggest U.S. banks, led by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and
 Bank of America Corp. , have allotted more than $100 billion to
lawyers, litigation and settlements since the financial crisis,
more than they’ve paid in dividends. Last month New York-based
JPMorgan reported its first quarterly loss under Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  because of surging legal expenses. The bank
has agreed to the final terms of a $13 billion settlement over
its sales of mortgage-backed securities.  For more, click here.  Legal Fees  Jefferson County’s Bankruptcy Left Few Winners as Debt Forgiven  The impact of Jefferson County’s bankruptcy will
reverberate for decades in  Alabama  and in the $3.7 trillion U.S.
municipal bond market.  Creditors, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., agreed to
forgive $1.4 billion of the county’s $3 billion sewer bonds.
Ratepayers, like Charles Hicks, a retired landscaper who lives
on a fixed income in Birmingham, will see his sewer rate rise
about 8 percent annually for the next four years and 3.5 percent
thereafter, under a plan approved Nov. 21 by a federal judge.  Since filing the $4.2 billion case in November 2011, the
county has spent more than $24 million on attorneys and other
advisers. Most of the payments went to the county’s two main law
firms.  Klee, Tuchin, Bogdanoff & Stern LLP  in  Los Angeles , which
is led by Ken Klee, the lawyer who helped rewrite the U.S.
 Bankruptcy Code  in the 1970s, collected $10.1 million in fees
and was reimbursed about $204,000 for expenses. The second firm,
 Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP , which has offices in
Birmingham, collected $8.2 million in fees and was reimbursed
about $294,000 for expenses.  For more, click here.  To contact the reporter on this story:
