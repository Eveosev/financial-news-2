Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , a unit of
Italy’s biggest utility, began construction on Chile’s largest
solar farm in the northern Atacama desert.  The $60 million Diego de Almagro project will have 36
megawatts of capacity, Rome-based  Enel SpA (ENEL)  said today in a
 statement  on its website. It will produce enough power for about
45,000 homes.  Chile has five solar plants online with a total of 6.9
megawatts of capacity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
