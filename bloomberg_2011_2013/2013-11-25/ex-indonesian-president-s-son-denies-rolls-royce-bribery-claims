(Corrects first name in second paragraph.)  The son of  Indonesia ’s former
president did not receive cash and a luxury car in return for
business in the country from  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/) , Europe’s
largest maker of aircraft engines, his lawyer said.  Tommy Suharto, youngest son of the former president and
formally called Hutomo Mandala Putra, denied the allegations in
a letter to Serious Fraud Office Chairman David Green, his
lawyer Elza Syarief said. Syarief referred to press reports that
Suharto had received $20 million and a Rolls-Royce car in return
for business with national carrier  Garuda Indonesia (GIAA)  PT.  “These accusations are false and have arisen, it appears,
via Internet comments posted by an ex-employee, not through any
formal source,” Syarief said in the statement.  Rolls-Royce said Dec. 6 it had contacted the SFO over
concerns of wrongdoing in business dealings in Asia. It named
David Gold, a member of the House of Lords and previously a
partner at the Herbert Smith LLP law firm, on Jan. 10 to review
anti-corruption procedures and has tightened policies on working
with intermediaries.  “The SFO has not contacted Rolls Royce, Garuda or Mr.
Suharto and there is no legal case or investigation, pending or
otherwise, in relation to these false allegations,” Syarief
said. Neither money or a car were provided in exchange for
convincing flag carrier Garuado to buy Trent 700 engines to
power Airbus SAS A330 jets, the legal representative said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
