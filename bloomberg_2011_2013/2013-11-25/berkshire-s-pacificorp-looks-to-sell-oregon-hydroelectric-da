Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s PacifiCorp
utility is seeking to sell a hydroelectric dam that’s no longer
profitable to operate.  The dam is on the Deschutes River in Bend, Oregon,
PacifiCorp said today in a statement. The company, owned by
 Warren Buffett ’s Omaha, Nebraska-based firm, may seek to place
the structure under local control.  “It’s time to divest or retire our Bend hydroelectric
plant,” Mark Tallman, PacifiCorp’s vice president for renewable
resources, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
