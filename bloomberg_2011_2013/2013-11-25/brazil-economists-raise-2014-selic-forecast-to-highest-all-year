Brazil  economists raised their 2014
key rate forecast to the highest level all year as a weakening
currency complicates efforts to slow inflation.  Brazil’s central bank will raise the benchmark Selic to
10.50 percent next year, compared with the previous week’s
forecast of 10.25 percent, according to the Nov. 22 central bank
survey of about 100 analysts published today. Analysts also see
the real at 2.30 per dollar by the end of this year, compared to
last week’s estimate of 2.27.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has struggled to
spark economic activity while taming inflation persisting near
the upper limit of the central bank’s target range. Consumer
prices have come under added pressure from a double-digit drop
in the real in 2013. The central bank will extend the world’s
biggest rate increase by raising the Selic by 50 basis points
this week, according all estimates from 25 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 10.86 percent at 9:02
a.m. local time. The real weakened by 0.1 percent to 2.2805 per
 U.S. dollar .  Analysts expect the central bank to lift the key rate by 25
basis points in January and resume the tightening cycle in
December, according to the survey.  Annual inflation through mid-November accelerated to 5.78
percent from 5.75 percent the month prior, and has remained
above the central bank’s 4.5 percent target for President
Rousseff’s entire term. Inflation continues to show resistance
and on an annual basis will remain elevated, the central bank’s
director for economic policy, Carlos Hamilton, said on Nov. 6.  The real has declined more than any other major currency in
the past six months and is down 10.1 percent year to date. A
weaker real may pressure inflation by making imports more
expensive.  Latin America ’s largest economy will grow 2.5 percent this
year, according to central bank estimates. That compares with
0.9 percent in 2012 and 2.7 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
