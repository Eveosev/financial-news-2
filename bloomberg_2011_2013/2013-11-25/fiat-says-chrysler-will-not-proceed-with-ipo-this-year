Fiat SpA (F) , the majority owner of
Chrysler Group LLC, said the American automaker will not carry
out an initial public offering this year.  The Chrysler board determined after speaking with the
carmaker’s underwriters that a share sale in 2013 is no longer
feasible, Turin, Italy-based Fiat said in a statement today.
Chrysler will continue to work on the IPO and may move forward
with the process in the first quarter.  “No assurance can be given as to whether or when an
offering will be launched,” Fiat said in the statement. “Any
launch will be subject to market conditions and other relevant
considerations.”  A United Auto Workers trust and Fiat are disputing the
company’s value as  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of
both carmakers, seeks to buy the UAW fund’s 41.5 percent stake.
The trust is working to determine whether to sell its holding to
Fiat directly or press forward with an IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
