The ruble weakened against the
central bank’s target basket of currencies as Brent crude headed
for its biggest loss in more than two weeks after  Iran  reached a
preliminary accord with other countries on its nuclear program.  The Russian currency weakened 0.3 percent to 38.0720
against the central bank’s basket of dollars and euros by 3:38
p.m. in Moscow. The yields on the government’s February 2027
ruble bond was unchanged at 7.84 percent.  Oil,  Russia ’s main export earner, fell 1.6 percent to
$109.27 per barrel in  London , snapping three days of gains and
set for the biggest one-day decline since Nov. 7. Iran agreed to
limit nuclear activities in return for easing some sanctions on
oil, auto parts, gold and precious metals after talks in Geneva
with diplomats from the U.S., China, Russia, the U.K.,  France 
and Germany.  “Iran is the trigger,” Anton Nikitin, an analyst at ZAO
VTB Capital in Moscow, said in e-mailed comments. “Outflows
from funds are of higher importance now, as the past several
weeks  emerging markets  have seen massive outflows.”  Emerging-market bond funds had outflows of $1.37 billion in
the week to Nov. 20, OAO Gazprombank said Nov. 22 in a report,
citing EPFR Global data. Developed-market bond funds saw a $4
billion inflow in the period.  The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent against the euro to
44.4200 and weakened 0.3 percent per dollar to 32.8575. An index
of the 20 most actively-traded emerging-market currencies was
little changed at 93.0815, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
