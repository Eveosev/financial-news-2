Benefits to adopting the euro, such
as easier access to capital and foreign funding, are becoming
“fiction,” Polish Finance Minister nominee Mateusz Szczurek
said in an interview with Dziennik Gazeta Prawna.  Evidence that euro membership offers better financing terms
is disappearing and joining the currency bloc now brings extra
fiscal commitments through the European Stability Mechanism,
Szczurek told the newspaper. Reducing  public debt  to less than
40 percent of gross domestic product, a policy outgoing Finance
Minister  Jacek Rostowski  backed to help prepare for euro
adoption, may not be sufficient, Szczurek said in the interview.  “In my opinion, joining the euro is worth much less than
it was before the crisis,” he said, according to Dziennik
Gazeta Prawna.  Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose party is seeking to
regain the lead in polls as the economy recovers from its worst
slowdown in more than a decade, picked Szczurek, a 38-year-old
ING Groep NV economist, as part of cabinet changes under which
seven ministers were replaced. Poland hasn’t set a timetable for
joining the euro area, with Rostowski repeatedly urging
overhauls that would eliminate risks related to the switch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
