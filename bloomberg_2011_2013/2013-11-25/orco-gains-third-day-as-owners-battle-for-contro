Orco Property Group SA advanced for
a third day as stakeholders vied for control of the company that
develops real estate in central  Europe .  The  stock  gained as much as 2.1 percent before trading 1.1
percent higher at 59.65 koruna as of 11:44 a.m. in  Prague , the
highest level since Oct. 11 on a closing basis. Orco has added
8.4 percent in the past three trading days, the biggest such
increase since mid-August.  Shareholders Alchemy Special Opportunities and Kingstown
Capital Management proposed Czech billionaire and biggest owner
Radovan Vitek be removed from the board of directors, according
to a Nov. 21 company statement. Alchemy and Kingstown own a
combined 23 percent of Luxembourg-based Orco, the notice shows.
The motion will be discussed at a general meeting on Dec. 6.  “Attempts to take control of Orco may prompt shareholders
to increase their stakes before the general meeting,” Miroslav Frayer, an analyst at Komercni Banka AS in Prague, wrote in a
report today. “That could boost the shares in the short term.”  The volume of securities traded today was about 50 percent
the three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Orco is up 4.7 percent this month, compared with a
gain of less than 1 percent for the benchmark  PX Index. (PX)   Vitek, who holds 31 percent of Orco, proposed six members
of the board be dismissed at the meeting next month, the
developer said on Nov. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
