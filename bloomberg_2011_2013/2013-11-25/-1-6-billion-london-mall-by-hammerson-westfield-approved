Westfield Group (WDC) , the world’s biggest
shopping-mall operator by assets, and  Hammerson Plc (HMSO)  won
preliminary approval to rebuild a mall in south London as part
of a project valued at about 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion).  The venture will also develop as many as 600 homes, offices
and leisure facilities after the local-government council in the
town of Croydon voted in favor of the Whitgift Centre project
today. The development will create as many as 5,000 jobs,
according to documents given to the members before the vote.  The development will be the largest retail and commercial
center in south London, the developers said in a  filing  to the
borough. Construction is expected to begin in 2015, Sydney-based
Westfield and London-based Hammerson said in January.  “A step-change in Croydon’s retail and leisure offer is
required,” the borough’s planners told members before the vote.
“The best opportunity for delivering this is via the
comprehensive redevelopment of the Whitgift Centre and
surrounding land.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
