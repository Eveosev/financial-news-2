Ethanol plunged the most in seven
weeks, widening its discount to gasoline, on concern that this
month’s price increase will slow demand.  The spread expanded 3.06 cents to 72.17 cents a gallon,
down from 94.1 cents on Nov. 6. Ethanol futures have dropped 4.3
percent since reaching an 11-week high on Nov. 21.  “Buyers just didn’t show up today,” said Jim Damask, a
manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida . “It just feels
like there are less people out here trying to buy it. It may
have gotten a little overdone.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery tumbled 7.6 cents,
or 3.7 percent, to $1.959 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. It was the biggest drop for a front-month contract since
Oct. 2. Prices have declined 11 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery slumped 4.54 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.6807 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The additive is made mostly from corn in the U.S. A
combination of lower corn prices and higher ethanol prices
encouraged more output.  Production has exceeded 900,000 barrels a day in the past
four reporting periods after being below that level for 16
months, data from the Energy Information Administration show.
Stockpiles were at 15.1 million barrels on Nov. 15, up 0.8
percent from the all-time low on Oct. 25, according to the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Crush Spread  Corn for December delivery added 2.5 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $4.2475 a bushel in Chicago. The corn crush spread, or the
difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn required to
make it, was 41 cents a gallon, down from 50 cents Nov. 22,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol declined 38.5 cents to
$2.625 a gallon in  New York , 47 cents to $2.50 in Chicago, 42.5
cents to $2.575 on the  Gulf Coast  and 25 cents to $2.60 on the
West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The West Coast traded 2.5 cents above the Gulf from a
discount of 15 cents on Nov. 22. New York Harbor’s premium to
Chicago widened 8.5 cents to 12.5 cents.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency enforces the
nation’s biofuel consumption mandate with tracking certificates
called Renewable Identification Numbers. They are attached to
each gallon of the fuel and can be traded among refiners.  Corn-based-ethanol RINs rose 5.5 cents to 25.5 cents, while
advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, advanced 2 cents to 24 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
