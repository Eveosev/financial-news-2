Robin Leigh-Pemberton, who was  Bank
of England  governor during Black Wednesday, has died at the age
of 86, the central bank said.  Leigh-Pemberton became governor in 1983 and retired 10
years later, when he was succeeded by Eddie George. He died last
night and the BOE will announce details of a memorial service
in“ due course,” it said in a statement today.  The son of an aristocrat, Leigh-Pemberton was a landowner
and farmer in Kent,  England , and served as chairman of Kent
County Council. Prior to his appointment to the BOE, Leigh-Pemberton, later Lord Kingsdown, was chairman of National
Westminster Bank. He led the central bank during the pound
crisis in 1992 that culminated in the currency’s expulsion from
the Exchange Rate Mechanism -- the precursor to the euro.  “A tall, imposing and cheerful man, Robin had a talent for
inspiring and persuading others to work for him,” said  Mervyn King , who joined the central bank as chief economist in 1991
when Leigh-Pemberton was governor. “A born captain, he will be
remembered with deep affection by the members of his team.”  King became governor in 2003 and retired this year. Current
Governor Mark Carney said Leigh-Pemberton made a “substantial
contribution to economic policy and the financial system of the
U.K.”  “He will be fondly remembered by current and former
colleagues at the Bank of England,” Carney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
