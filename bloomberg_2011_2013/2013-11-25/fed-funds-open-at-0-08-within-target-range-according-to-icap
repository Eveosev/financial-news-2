Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.08 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.27 percent on Nov. 22 after trading
from 0.05 percent to 0.27 percent and averaging 0.08 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries $2.75 to $3.5
billion Treasuries maturing from February 2021 to November 2023.
The purchases, which are permanent open market operations, are
the part of the Fed’s quantitative easing program aimed at
keeping long-term rates low.  The Fed may also conduct a test of an overnight fixed-rate
reverse repo facility. The temporary open-market operations will
use Treasuries as collateral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
