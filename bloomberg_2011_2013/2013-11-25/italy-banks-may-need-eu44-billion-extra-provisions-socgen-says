Italian banks may have to set aside
an additional 44 billion euros ($59 billion) in provisions for
bad loans, analysts at  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  said.  Doubtful loans have increased at a faster pace than
expected,  Carlo Tommaselli , an analyst at Societe Generale,
wrote in a report today. To bring its provisioning to a
sustainable level would require a 40 percent markdown of the
bad-loan portfolio, leading to a capital shortfall of 19 billion
euros, he estimated.  “This extremely harsh scenario could be manageable as the
banks may enjoy additional buffers to reduce the capital
shortfall and could also use some collateral to further reduce
the bill,” Tommaselli said in the note.  Italian firms and families are struggling to repay their
debts as unemployment rises, forcing banks to set aside more
money for soured loans. Gross non-performing loans as a
proportion of lending increased to 7.5 percent in September from
5.9 percent a year earlier, according to data published by the
Italian Banking Association today. That’s the highest since
November 1999.  To contact the reporters on this story:
