Quebec ’s government will miss its
goal of balancing the budget in the fiscal year that began in
April and will wait until 2015-16 before returning to balance,
La Presse newspaper  reported , without saying where it obtained
the information.  Quebec’s deficit for 2013-14 will probably be C$2.5 billion
($2.4 billion), followed by a C$1.75 billion shortfall in
2014-15, La Presse said.  Finance Minister Nicolas Marceau will confirm he is
abandoning the balanced-budget goal this week or early next week
when he provides a fiscal update, the newspaper said. Tax
revenue has been growing more slowly than expected, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
