The euro, the second best-performing
major currency this year, has increased so much that it will
weigh on economic growth in the euro region going into 2014,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc.’s Jens Nordvig.  The strength of the 17-nation shared currency, which has
increased 2.4 percent versus the dollar year-to-date, the most
after  Denmark ’s krone, will trim euro area growth by 0.5 percent
in 2014, said Nordvig. The shared currency was the fifth-worst
performer among the greenback’s 16 most-traded counterparts in
2012.  “If you look at how much the euro has moved, and the
impact that’s going to have on exports, it’s starting to be a
real issue,” Nordvig, the New York-based managing director of
currency research at Nomura, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Radio’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Michael McKee.
“Last year, it was a dilemma about coming up with policies that
really stated very clearly the euro is here to stay. It’s an
ironic situation.”  The euro depreciated 0.4 percent to $1.3508 at 12:19 p.m.
in New York after earlier falling as much as 0.5 percent. The
shared currency rose to $1.3832 on Oct. 25, its highest level
since November 2011.  Europe’s currency climbed to a four-year high against the
yen on Nov. 19 after a European Central Bank board member said
policy makers must be “very careful” about using negative
interest rates to counter low inflation.  The ECB is the only major central bank that hasn’t
entertained the idea of quantitative easing, which means it has
to consider different ways to come across as dovish in order to
stem the rise in the euro, according to Nordvig.  “It’s absolutely crucial that the ECB signals more clearly
that they have more tools and are willing to use them as
needed,” Nordvig said. “We should see urgency, and I think
hopefully the ECB will start to get more aggressive.”  The 17-nation euro has gained 6.8 percent this year, making
it the best performer out of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 4 percent and the yen slipped the most, 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
