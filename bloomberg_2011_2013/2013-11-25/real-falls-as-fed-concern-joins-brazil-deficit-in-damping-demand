Brazil’s real declined on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will curtail monetary stimulus
amid concern the government’s deteriorating finances will lead
to a reduced  credit rating .  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.2826 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:09 a.m. in Sao Paulo after rising 1.5 percent last
week, its first weekly gain since Oct. 18. Swap rates on the
contracts due in January 2015 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 10.86 percent.  “The dollar’s recovery is tied to the possibility that the
Fed may reduce stimulus,” Joao Paulo de Gracia Correa, currency
manager at Correparti Corretora de Cambio, said in a telephone
interview from Curitiba, Brazil.  The real has fallen 1.9 percent since Oct. 31, when the
central bank reported that the government  budget deficit  swelled
in September to the biggest in almost four years. In the U.S.,
Fed officials signaled in minutes of their October meeting
published last week that they may taper their $85 billion in
monthly bond buying in coming months if the world’s largest
economy improves as anticipated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
