Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s largest
commercial buyer of liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a
spot cargo from  Nigeria , ship-tracking data show.  The Seri Begawan, with about 150,000 cubic meters of
capacity, is en route to the Pyeongtaek terminal on  South
Korea ’s west coast, according to transmissions captured by IHS
Fairplay on Bloomberg. It was scheduled to arrive yesterday.  The vessel loaded the supercooled gas at Nigeria LNG Ltd.’s
terminal at Bonny Island and departed Oct. 22. South Korea
doesn’t have long-term LNG contracts with Nigeria, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Asian LNG importers typically purchase more spot shipments
from December to March to meet peak heating and power demand
during winter in the northern hemisphere. Prices of the fuel for
delivery over the next four to eight weeks rose to $18.60 per
million British thermal units, New York-based Energy
Intelligence Group said Nov. 20 on the website of its World Gas
Intelligence publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
