Rubber climbed to a one-week high as
a weaker Japanese currency boosted the appeal of yen-based
contracts.  Futures for delivery in April on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange gained 0.3 percent to 260.7 yen a kilogram ($2,559 a
metric ton), the highest settlement since Nov. 18.  The yen weakened to 101.92 per dollar, the lowest level in
almost six months, as demand for the safety of the Japanese
currency waned after an accord was struck to set limits on
 Iran’s nuclear program .  “Rubber was supported by a weaker yen after the Iran
nuclear agreement and on gains in equities markets,” Vanessa Tan, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte said by phone from
 Singapore .  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell 1.3 percent to close at 18,850  yuan  ($3,093) a ton.  Thai rubber free-on-board added 0.3 percent to 79.10 baht
($2.47) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . Prices were supported by limited supplies
as heavy rains and flooding in the country’s southern provinces
have disrupted tapping, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
