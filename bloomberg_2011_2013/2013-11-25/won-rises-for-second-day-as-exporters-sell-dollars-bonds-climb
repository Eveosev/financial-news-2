South Korea’s won climbed for a
second day on speculation exporters are selling dollars to meet
month-end expenses. Government bonds gained.  Reviving Asia’s fourth-largest economy will be the focus of
government policy in 2014, Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said at
a meeting in  Seoul  today. The authorities are keeping a close
watch on the foreign-exchange market and monitoring the won’s
volatility, Hyun told reporters. The currency will rise beyond
1,000 per dollar next year as it is regarded as a “safe haven”
because of South Korea’s foreign reserves and current-account
surplus,  Philip Wee , senior currency economist at DBS Bank Ltd.
in  Singapore , wrote in a Nov. 22 research note.  “Exporters are selling dollars as it’s nearing the end of
the month,” said Han Sung Min, a currency trader at Busan Bank
in Seoul. “Lower volatility is being seen in the market with no
big external factors.”  The won rose 0.2 percent to 1,058.80 per dollar as of 9:44
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
0.4 percent off a two-year high of 1,054.35 reached Oct. 24.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, declined eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.17 percent.  The Bank of  Korea  cut its economic growth outlook for 2014
on Oct. 10 to 3.8 percent from the 4 percent it projected in
July, citing a weaker-than-expected global economy. South Korea
may report a current-account surplus of $63 billion this year,
the central bank forecast last month, increasing its previous
July estimate of $53 billion.  The yield on the 2.75 percent sovereign notes due June 2016
fell one basis point to 2.95 percent in Seoul, according to
Korea Exchange Inc prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
