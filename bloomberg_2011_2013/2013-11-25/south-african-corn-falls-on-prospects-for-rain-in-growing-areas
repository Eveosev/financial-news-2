South African corn futures fell by
the midday close in Johannesburg on the prospects for rainfall
in growing areas, potentially boosting the crop.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, dropped 0.7 percent to 2,410 rand ($240) a metric ton
on the South African Futures Exchange. The white variety for
delivery in the same month fell 0.3 percent to 2,464 rand a ton.  The town of Lichtenburg in the North West province, the
region that produces about 14 percent of the nation’s corn, has
a 30 percent chance of rain from today until Nov. 28 and a 60
percent chance on Nov. 29, according to  South African Weather
Service  website.  “There is a good forecast for rain in the western maize
production areas later in the week and more rain is forecast for
next week,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at Pretoria-based BVG (Pty)
Ltd., said in an e-mailed response to questions.  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest producer of corn. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety of the grain is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat futures fell for a third day to settle at 3,514 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
