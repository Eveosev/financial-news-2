Money managers cut bearish bets on
robusta coffee in London by  21 percent  in the latest week at a
time of slow exports from leading grower  Vietnam , according to
data from NYSE Liffe, the derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext.  Investors were net-short, or betting on lower prices, by
8,490 futures and options in the week ended Nov. 19, the
Commitments of Traders report published on the exchange’s
 website  today showed. That compares with 10,792 contracts a week
earlier. The beans used to make instant coffee and espresso
rallied 4.5 percent in the period.  Coffee exports from Vietnam are forecast at 94,000 metric
tons this month, data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development showed. That’s down from 122,000 tons a year
earlier. Stockpiles in warehouses monitored by Liffe fell 8
percent in the two weeks to Nov. 11 to 48,770 tons, bourse data
showed. That’s lower than the 52,000 tons predicted by traders
in August in a Bloomberg survey for the end of the year. Prices
gained 4.3 percent last week, the most in seven weeks.  “Prices rallied last week on speculative short covering,
low certified stockpiles, with expectations of further inventory
draw-downs, given weight by the lack of coffee coming out of
Vietnam,” Toby Donovan, a broker at BGC Partners LLC in London,
said by e-mail today.  Robusta coffee supplies will be 2.4 million bags bigger
than demand in the 2013-14 season started Oct. 1 in most
countries, estimates  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia ’s biggest
investment bank. That compares with a surplus of 6.4 million
bags for the arabica variety, favored for specialty drinks such
as those made by Starbucks Corp., the bank said. A bag weighs 60
kilograms, or 132 pounds.  Cocoa Record  In cocoa, money managers boosted bullish bets to a  record ,
exchange data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The net-long
position was 68,949 futures and options as of Nov. 19, up from
64,676 contracts a week earlier. The beans used to make
chocolate advanced 5.1 percent in the period.  Investors  trimmed bets  on higher white, or refined, sugar
prices to 8,338 futures and options, the data showed. That
compares with 8,805 contracts a week earlier. The sweetener slid
1.2 percent in the period.  In feed wheat, money managers were net-short by 159
