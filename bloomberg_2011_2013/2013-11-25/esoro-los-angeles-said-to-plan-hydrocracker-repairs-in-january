Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s Los Angeles-area
refinery plans to shut a hydrocracker for repairs in January,
according to two people familiar with the schedule.  Maintenance on the unit is expected to last about six
weeks, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information isn’t public. Hydrocrackers convert
heavy hydrocarbons into lighter fuels such as high-octane
gasoline and diesel.  Tina Barbee, a Tesoro spokeswoman at the company’s
headquarters in  San Antonio , declined to comment on the work in
an e-mail.  Tesoro’s Los Angeles refinery, made up of two plants in
Carson and Wilmington, can run a total of 363,000 barrels a day,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Wilmington complex
primarily runs heavy crude produced in California and imported
from abroad, while the Carson site runs oil from Alaska’s North
Slope, the Middle East and West Africa, according to the company
statements.  Tesoro bought the 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson plant from
London-based  BP Plc (BP/)  on June 1. The company has been integrating
the two complexes and refers to both collectively as the Los
Angeles refinery, a Nov. 6 statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
