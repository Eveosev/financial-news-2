China’s stocks  slid for a third day,
led by energy producers, after a explosion at a  China Petroleum
& Chemical Corp. (600028)  pipeline killed 55 people and crude oil fell.  China Petroleum, also known as Sinopec, slumped the most in
five months. PetroChina Co. and China Shenhua Energy Co. dropped
at least 1.3 percent as Brent crude sank 2.6 percent. Anhui Sun-Create Electronics Co., a radar maker, and Wuhan Guide Infrared
Co. led gains by defense-related companies after the government
imposed a protected air zone in the  East China Sea .  Ningbo Port
Co. (601018)  jumped 10 percent on speculation more cities will follow
Shanghai in setting up free-trade zones.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.5 percent to
2,186.12 at the close. Sinopec, which has the fifth-biggest
weighting on the gauge, said operations at its “super-large”
production complex in the city of Qingdao will be disrupted
after the crude pipeline blast. China traded barbs with the U.S.
and Japan over the new air defense zone, as tensions escalated
between Asia’s largest economies.  “ Sinopec (601857)  is a heavy-weighted stock so its decline has
pressures the benchmark index,” said Wang Weijun, a strategist
at Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai. “Military stocks are
often event-driven. When there’s tension between China and
Japan, they move a lot.”  The CSI 300 Index declined 0.4 percent to 2,388.63 today.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 0.3 percent.  A measure tracking energy stocks sank 1.8 percent on the
CSI 300.  Sinopec Blast  Sinopec lost 4 percent to 4.85 yuan, its biggest drop since
June 24. The explosion occurred after oil leaked from the
pipeline into Qingdao’s municipal rainwater network. Xinhua News
Agency, which reported the death toll, said 136 people are
injured and 9 are missing.  PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil company, dropped 1.5
percent to 7.98  yuan . Shenhua, the country’s largest coal
producer, fell 1.3 percent to 16.56 yuan.  Crude retreated after Iran agreed to curtail nuclear
activities in return for easing of some sanctions on oil, auto
parts, gold and precious metals, the first major crack in a
decade-long deadlock.  Anhui Sun-Create Electronics advanced by the 10 percent
daily limit to 30.86 yuan. Wuhan Guide gained 10 percent to
18.81 yuan.  China Spacesat Co. (600118)  added 2.5 percent to 18.74 yuan.  The government announced an air defense identification zone
in the East China Sea effective Nov. 23. Japan lodged a
complaint as the U.S. and  South Korea  expressed concern about
China’s actions. China’s Defense Ministry filed protests to both
nations’ embassies, calling Japan’s remarks “unreasonable” and
the U.S. comments “wrong,” according to a statement posted on
the ministry’s website today.  Ningbo Port jumped 10 percent to 2.54 yuan. Tianjin Port
Co. climbed 3 percent to 9.61 yuan.  Rizhao Port Co. (600017)  advanced 4.4
percent to 2.82 yuan.  Free Trade  The State Council has approved the Dongjiang  free-trade 
zone in Tianjin, the Shanghai Securities News reported on its
website, citing Zheng Xinli, vice chairman of the China Center
for International Economic Exchanges. The council also approved
a free-trade zone in the eastern province of Zhejiang, the
report cited Zheng as saying.  The China Securities Journal also reported today the
government may allow Guangdong and Tianjin to set up their own
free-trade zones.  “It looks like more places will follow Shanghai’s steps in
setting up free-trade zones and that has exceeded market
expectations,” said Wang of Zheshang Securities. “The market
had expected Shanghai to be the only free-trade zone in China in
the near future.” 11 are missing.  The Shanghai Composite is down 3.7 percent this year and
trades at 8.6 times projected profit for the next 12 months,
compared with the seven-year average of 15.3, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
