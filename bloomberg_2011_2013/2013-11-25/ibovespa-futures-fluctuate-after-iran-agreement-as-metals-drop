Ibovespa  futures  fluctuated between
gains and losses after  Iran  agreed to limit its nuclear program,
boosting demand for riskier stocks such as equities, and lower
metals dimmed the outlook for producers.  Oil company  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA  may move after
agreeing to sell a stake of its assets in  Brazil ’s Solimoes
basin.  Gerdau SA (GGBR4)  may be active after Credit Suisse Group AG cut
its recommendation on the steelmaker to the equivalent of hold.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in December climbed 0.1
percent to 52,925 at 9:21 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened
0.4 percent to 2.2875 per U.S. dollar. The Bloomberg Base Metals
3-Month Price Commodity Index fell 0.1 percent.  The MSCI World Index advanced 0.1 percent as Iran agreed to
curtail nuclear activities in return for easing of some
sanctions on oil, auto parts, gold and precious metals, an
accord that broke a decade-long deadlock.  Brazil’s main equity index entered a bull market Sept. 9
after rising 20 percent from this year’s  low  on July 3 through
that day. The gauge is still down 23 percent in dollar terms
this year, compared with a decline of 3.9 percent for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 6.25 billion
reais on Nov. 22, compared with a daily average of 7.55 billion
