Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index advancing for a third day, as the yen touched the weakest
in more than four months against the dollar. Brokerages and
insurers led gains.  The Topix added 0.5 percent to 1,254.26 as of 9:01 a.m. in
 Tokyo , with 30 of the 33 industry groups rising. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average increased 0.8 percent to 15,500.54. The yen was
little changed at 101.25 per dollar after touching 101.36, its
weakest level since July 8.  Iran  yesterday agreed to curtail its nuclear activities and
in return won an easing of “certain sanctions” on oil, auto
parts, gold and precious metals. U.S. home sales data today is
forecast to show an increase in October from the previous month,
adding to reports last week that showed weekly jobless claims
fell to the lowest level since September and American consumers
became less pessimistic this month.  The Topix advanced 45 percent this year through Nov. 22,
the most among 24 developed markets tracked by Bloomberg, as
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda added stimulus to the economy in a bid to end deflation
and boost growth. Kuroda speaks in Tokyo today.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its price target for
Japanese shares last week for the sixth time this year on
expectations the government will make progress on measures such
as cutting corporate taxes and restarting nuclear reactors. The

up from the 1,400 projection set on May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
