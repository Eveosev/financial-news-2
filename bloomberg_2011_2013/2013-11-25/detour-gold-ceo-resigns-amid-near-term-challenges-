Detour Gold Corp. (DGC) , the operator of
the Detour Lake mine in  Canada , said Gerald Panneton resigned as
chief executive officer as the company faces “near-term
challenges.”  Chief Financial Officer  Paul Martin  will serve as interim
CEO while Detour Gold searches for Panneton’s replacement, the
Toronto-based company said in a statement today. The shares fell
11 percent to C$3.80 at 9:35 a.m. in Toronto.  Detour Gold, whose biggest investor is hedge fund firm
Paulson & Co., has dropped 85 percent this year amid a decline
in metal prices and after the company cuts its production
forecast in May. Panneton began as CEO in 2006 and led the
company’s development of Detour Lake in northeastern Ontario,
which poured its first gold bars in February and started
commercial output Sept. 1.  During 30 days of commercial production in September,
Detour Gold’s cash costs were $1,214 an ounce, it said Nov. 7.
Gold for immediate delivery in London fell 0.3 percent to
$1,240.29 at 2:37 p.m. in London.  Detour Gold also said Nov. 7 that operating costs will
decrease as it improves efficiency and raises the mine’s ore-processing rate to the design capacity of 55,000 tons a day.  Paulson holds an 11 percent stake in the company, according
to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
