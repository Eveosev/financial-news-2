Commercial Bank of Kuwait SAK  gained
the most in more than a week on investor bets the lender is
poised to gain after it cleaned up its bad debts.  The shares  jumped 7.1 percent, the most since Nov. 17, to
750 fils. The stock, which has advanced 5.5 percent this year,
was the second-biggest gainer on the benchmark  Kuwait SE Price
Index, (KWSEIDX)  which declined 0.5 percent.  Banks in Kuwait are recovering with the pace of lending
picking up after years of scaling back credit to investment
companies, some of which defaulted on payments after the global
credit crisis.  Commercial Bank of Kuwait  reported zero profit in
the third quarter after posting a loss of 12.6 million dinars
($45 million) in the year-ago period.  “They have been cleaning up the non-performing loans quite
aggressively,” said  Jaap Meijer , an executive director at
Dubai-based Arqaam Capital. “We see room for the bank to do
better based on the fundamentals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
