OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s largest maker
of coal for steelmakers, fell for a second day in New York as
concern that prices for the fuel are dropping outweighed a pact
that will allow the company to avoid defaulting on its debt.  American depositary receipts of Mechel slid 3.5 percent to
$2.21 yesterday after touching the lowest level since the
company listed in the U.S. in 2004. The ADR lost 68 percent this
year. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian equities in the U.S. fell 1 percent to 98.57. RTS stock-index futures increased less than 0.1 percent to 143,270.  Spot prices for coking coal used in the $1.3 trillion
market for steel have tumbled 11 percent this year, compared
with a 3.1 percent decline for the  S&P GSCI gauge  of 24
commodities. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev met metals and
mining industry executives in Moscow yesterday to discuss
support for an industry suffering a drop in global demand. A
group of lenders agreed to free  Mechel (MTL)  of covenant tests on a $1
billion loan until the end on 2014, the Moscow-based company
said yesterday.  “Falling coal price leaves no hope for Mechel,” Vladimir Sergievskiy, an analyst at Barclays Plc in  London  who has a
sell recommendation on the stock, said by phone yesterday.
“Coking coal doesn’t offer any signs of recovery, any reason
for optimism at all, as prices fall and the decline will 
probably continue next year.”  Barclays predicts coking coal prices will drop to an
average $155 per metric ton in 2014, from $159 in 2013 and $209
in 2012, Sergievskiy said. Prices are expected to recover to 
$170 per ton in 2015, he said, citing the bank’s estimate.  Loan Guarantees  The Russian government may compensate for interest-rate
costs incurred in funding development projects in the metals and
mining industry, according to the agenda of Medvedev’s meeting
yesterday. It’s also granting loan guarantees and ease rules on
the central bank accepting company bonds as collateral.  Mechel, controlled by billionaire  Igor Zyuzin , is the
country’s second-most indebted company after United Co. Rusal,
the world’s largest aluminum producer. ING Bank NV, Societe
Generale SA,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Commerzbank AG, Raiffeissen Bank
International AG, VTB, Caterpillar Financial Services
Corporation and ICBC Plc are among banks to sign the agreement.  Certain loan covenants require Mechel to achieve net debt
of no more than 7.5 times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization by the end of 2013, while the
first-quarter ratio was 10.9 times, ING said in a report this
month. The Moscow-based company is seeking new covenants for
2014 and 2015, Vedomosti reported this month.  Russian ETF  The Moscow-traded stock retreated 3.2 percent to 67 
rubles, or $2.03, yesterday.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, fell 1.6 percent
to $28.28, the biggest decline since Nov. 5. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in the stock futures,
decreased 0.8 percent to 21.55.  Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLZLY) , Russia’s biggest gold
producer, gained for the first time in six days, increasing 3.1
percent to $3.11.  United Co. Rusal, a Moscow-based aluminum producer, tumbled
5.4 percent to HK$2.28 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:32 a.m.
local time, poised for the biggest loss since June 20. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
