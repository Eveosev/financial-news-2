Progressive Corp. (PGR) , the fourth-largest U.S. auto insurer, said Chief Executive Officer Glenn Renwick is taking the additional role of chairman, after the
death ofPeter Lewis, who previously led the board.  Renwick, 58, will also retain the title of president, the
Mayfield Village, Ohio-based insurer said today in a statement.  Lewis was CEO from 1965 to 2000 when he turned over the job
to Renwick. The company’s largest shareholder, he remained non-executive chairman until his death on Nov. 23.  Progressive joins the two largest U.S. providers of car
coverage in turning to a single person to handle the roles of
chairman and CEO. Ed Rust leads State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co., and Tom Wilson runs Allstate Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
