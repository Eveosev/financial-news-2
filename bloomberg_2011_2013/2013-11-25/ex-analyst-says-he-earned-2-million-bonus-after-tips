Former Diamondback Capital
Management LLC analyst Jesse Tortora said he was paid a bonus of
more than $2 million the year illegal tips he provided his boss
on Dell Inc. helped earn the fund more than $3.8 million.  Tortora is the first of a group of former hedge-fund
analysts who are cooperating with the U.S. and testifying at the
insider trial of SAC Capital Advisors LP fund manager Michael Steinberg. Prosecutors say Steinberg, who has pleaded not
guilty, earned more than $1.4 million on illegal tips fed to him
by his former analyst, Jon Horvath. Tortora testified he
provided Horvath with secret earnings information about Dell in
2008 and on  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)  in 2009.  The former Diamondback analyst told a  Manhattan  federal
jury today that he shared inside information he obtained from
insiders at technology companies with Horvath and a group of
analysts who were friends from 2007 to early 2010.  Tortora said he funneled the information to his boss,
former Diamondback fund manager  Todd Newman , and testified
Horvath told him he was providing Steinberg with the same tips
which he traded on.  Tortora testified he earned more than $3.4 million during
the three-and-a-half years he worked at Diamondback and was paid
more than $2.25 million in salary and bonus in 2008 -- the year
of the successful Dell trade. Steinberg made more than $1
million for SAC based on the same illegal tip about Dell, which
was provided to him by Horvath, prosecutors said.  Spent Money  Asked how much money he had now, Tortora said he has about
$100,0000 left from his years on  Wall Street .  “While I was there I spent money a bit excessively,”
Tortora testified. “I lost a lot of money doing two things, by
day trading, which I lost about $400,000, and several other
hundred thousand dollars by gambling in Vegas.”  Tortora said he had more than $500,000 in the bank when he
left the hedge fund and has since spent about $400,000 in legal
fees while under investigation. He pleaded guilty in January
2012 and awaits sentencing. Newman was convicted of  insider
trading  after a trial in  New York  last year and sentenced to 4
1/2 years in prison. He’s free while he appeals his conviction.  “I took trips to Vegas, playing blackjack and sports
betting,” Tortora said.  The case is U.S. v. Steinberg, 12-cr-00121, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
