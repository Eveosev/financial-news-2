The Carolina Panthersâ€™ Dec. 8 game
at the New Orleans Saints was moved to Sunday night on NBC,
relegating the matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and Green Bay
Packers to an afternoon start.  The  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  network opted to take advantage of
National Football League broadcast rules that allow for flexible
scheduling on Sundays during Weeks 11-17 in order to highlight
better matchups, it said in a statement.  The Falcons, who reached the National Football Conference
championship last year, are 2-9 this year after falling to New
Orleans on Nov. 21. The Packers, playing without Pro Bowl
quarterback  Aaron Rodgers , tied Minnesota 26-26 yesterday and
are 5-5-1. The Saints are 9-2 and the Panthers, who beat the
Miami Dolphins yesterday, are 8-3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
