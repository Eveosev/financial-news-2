The U.S. government sought to
intervene in a lawsuit accusing units of  H&R Block Inc. (HRB) , the
biggest U.S. tax preparer, of operating a website inaccessible
to people who are blind, deaf or have other disabilities.  The Justice Department asked a federal court in  Boston  to
let it join a lawsuit against the companies filed by the
National Federation of the Blind. The U.S. in court papers
accused two H&R Block units, HRB Digital and HRB Tax Group, of
violating the Americans with Disabilities Act.  “Inaccessible websites of public accommodations are not
simply an inconvenience to individuals with disabilities,”
Jocelyn Samuels, acting assistant attorney general for civil
rights, said in a statement. “They deny persons with
disabilities access to basic goods and services that people
without disabilities take advantage of every day.”  H&R Block’s website isn’t designed to be used with commonly
available technology -- such as screen reader software,
refreshable Braille displays and keyboard navigation aids -- for
people who are blind, deaf or have trouble with manual
dexterity, the U.S. said in court papers.  As a result, two people who sued and other disabled people
aren’t able to register for an online account with H&R Block,
the U.S. said. The website offers tax advice, do-it-yourself tax
return preparation and electronic filing, the government said in
court papers.  Officials for H&R Block, based in Kansas City, Missouri,
didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
