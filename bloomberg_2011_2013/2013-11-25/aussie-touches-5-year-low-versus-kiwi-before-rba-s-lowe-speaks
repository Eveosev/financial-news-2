Australia ’s dollar slid to a five-year low versus the New Zealand currency before the bigger
nation’s  Reserve Bank  deputy governor speaks tomorrow amid
speculation his central bank will curb strength in the currency.  The Aussie touched a 2 1/2-month low on Nov. 22 against the
 U.S. dollar , the day after Reserve Bank of Australia Governor
Glenn Stevens said he remains “open-minded” on currency
intervention. New Zealand’s kiwi gained against all 16 major
peers as swap rates climbed to a two-year high amid bets the
nation’s central bank will raise borrowing costs next year.  “The RBA’s stance of containing currency strength is very
clear, so some caution is needed” against remarks from RBA
speakers, said Kengo Suzuki, the Tokyo-based chief currency
strategist at Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-biggest financial group by market value. Aussie-kiwi may fall
further “when the prospects for a  New Zealand  rate hike get
clearer next year.”  Australia’s currency weakened 0.6 percent to NZ$1.1140 as
of 2:05 p.m. in Sydney after earlier touching NZ$1.1137, the
lowest since October 2008.  The Aussie retreated 0.2 percent to 91.67 U.S. cents after
touching 91.44 on Nov. 22, the weakest since Sept. 6. It slumped
2 percent last week, the most since the period ended Aug. 2. The
kiwi rose 0.4 percent to 82.28 U.S. cents after losing 1.7
percent last week.  Two-year swap rates in New Zealand climbed three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.68 percent, a level not
seen since August 2011. The  Reserve Bank of New Zealand  may
start to raise the benchmark rate from 2.5 percent by June next
year, according to economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year government note declined
four basis points to 4.28 percent. It touched 4.35 percent at
the end of last week, the highest since November 2011.  RBA Deputy Governor  Philip Lowe  will deliver a keynote
address at a conference tomorrow in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
