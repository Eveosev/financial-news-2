Statoil ASA (STL)  moved closer to building
Europe’s largest floating wind farm after abandoning a similar
project in Maine.  The Norwegian energy producer won a lease agreement to
install five  wind turbines  at a site off Scotland, the U.K.’s
Crown Estate said in a  website statement . The venture will be
Britain’s first floating wind farm, it said.  Statoil is focusing on Scotland after exiting a similar
venture in Maine citing contract terms and project delays. The
company is using the floating technology because it allows
access to deeper waters where conventional offshore turbines
can’t function. Japan has spearheaded its development after the
2011 Fukushima disaster led to nuclear-reactor shutdowns.  “Scotland has a huge offshore wind resource but to
maximize this opportunity we need to move into deeper water,”
John Swinney, Scottish cabinet secretary for finance, employment
and sustainable growth, said in the statement dated Nov. 23.  Statoil’s 30-megawatt venture is planned for the Buchan
Deep site, about 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 19 miles) off
Peterhead in Aberdeenshire where waters are more than 100 meters
deep. The company is seeking government approval before making
an  investment decision , according to the  Crown Estate , which
manages Britain’s seabed.  Statoil’s technology involves attaching turbines to steel
cylinders that are fastened to the seabed with mooring lines.
The structures float in areas too deep for traditional towers to
be fixed to the seafloor. The project is the next phase of
Statoil’s Hywind project, the world’s first full-scale floating
turbine that has operated off  Norway  since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
