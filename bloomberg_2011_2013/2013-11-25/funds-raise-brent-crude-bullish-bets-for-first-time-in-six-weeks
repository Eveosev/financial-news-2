Hedge funds and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  for the first time in six
weeks, according to ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 107,381 lots in
the week ended Nov. 19, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. The increase of 18,293
contracts, or 21 percent, is the first gain since the week to
Oct. 8.  Bearish positions  by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish wagers by 273,687 contracts.
The 2.1 percent decrease in net-short bets from the week to Nov.
19 brings their position to its smallest since April 16.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as  hedge funds  and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Brent futures rose 1 percent to $106.92 a barrel in the
week to Nov. 19 and were at $109.26 as of 12:01 p.m. local time.  Swap dealers decreased net-long positions by 10 percent to
205,811 contracts in the period.  Money managers’ bullish bets on European gasoil advanced by
27 percent to 53,553 lots, the first increase in four weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
