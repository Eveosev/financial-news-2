Residential property taxes in
Toronto will rise 2.5 percent next year to help finance a subway
expansion and to cover costs to host the Pan American Games,
according to the draft budget released today.  The city’s total operating budget will be C$9.6 billion
($9.1 billion), up from the 2013 total of C$9.5 billion,
according to the proposal presented to the budget committee at
 Canada ’s biggest city.  The tax rise includes a 0.5 percent increase for a new
subway line in the eastern suburb of Scarborough, as well as
money for hiring 300 new police officers and spending on
preparations for the 2015 Pan American Games.  The budget committee will debate and revise the spending
plan before sending it on to city council, which is scheduled to
vote on the final budget on Jan. 30.  Mayor Rob Ford said he opposes the 2.5 percent tax
increase, saying he backs a 1.75 percent jump.  “We can all see the old ways coming back of taxing and
spending at city hall,” Ford told the budget committee.  City council stripped Ford of most of his powers last week
after he said he had smoked  crack cocaine , bought illegal drugs
and may have driven after drinking alcohol.  The Toronto Transit Commission, which runs public transport
in the city, will see its budget go up C$43 million, with the
city contributing C$13.1 million and the rest coming from fare
increases and revenue from new riders, according to the proposed
budget. The cost of a monthly transit pass will rise C$5.25 on
Jan. 1, to C$133.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
