Michelin today awarded a third star to De Leest, in Vaassen, where Jacob Jan Boerma becomes only the second chef in the Netherlands currently to hold the top ranking.  There are second stars for Bord’Eau, in Amsterdam, and for FG and Fred, both in Rotterdam, Michelin said. De Librije, in Zwolle, under Jonnie Boer, holds onto its third star. Oud Sluis drops out of the ratings because it is closing.  “Jacob Jan Boerma offers a highly personalized style of cooking in which preparation and culinary techniques are perfectly mastered,”  Michael Ellis , international director of the guides, said in an e-mailed release. “His cuisine is creative and full of influences from the world.”  Three stars mean exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey; two are for excellent cooking, worth a detour; one denotes a very good restaurant in its category.  The new winners of a single star include Bridges and Ron Gastrobar, both in Amsterdam.  Michelin & Cie , Europe’s largest tiremaker, produced first guide in 1900. It was free of charge until 1920 and intended for chauffeurs. The volume contained practical information, including street maps and tips on repairing tires. The company is based in Clermont-Ferrand, France.  The company listed the following awards:  ( Richard Vines  is the chief food critic for Bloomberg News.
