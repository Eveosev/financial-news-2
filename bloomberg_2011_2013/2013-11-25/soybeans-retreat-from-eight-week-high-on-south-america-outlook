Soybean futures rose to a two-month
high as record U.S. export shipments tighten supplies for
domestic processors. Wheat and corn advanced.  Soybeans  inspected  for export in the week ended Nov. 21
jumped 39 percent to 66.93 million bushels from a year earlier,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report today.
Shipments since Sept. 1 rose 5.9 percent to 585.6 million from
553.1 million a year earlier, the fastest pace ever, USDA data
show.  China , the biggest consumer, imported 77 percent of the
total last week.  “Soybean exports are flying out of the country at a pace
that is quickly tightening up supplies,”  Jerry Gidel , the chief
grain analyst for Rice Dairy LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “Domestic processors are raising bids to prevent
supplies from going overseas.”  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 0.7 percent to
settle at $13.2925 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $13.345, the highest for a most-active
contract since Sept. 20.  Soybean-meal futures for January delivery added 1.8 percent
to $428.40 for 2,000 pounds of the animal feed, capping the
first three-day gain since Nov. 8.  Prices earlier fell on speculation that rain in South
America improved early crop development and yield potential.
Production in Brazil will rise to a record 88 million metric
tons, and Argentina’s  harvest  may jump 8.5 percent to 53.5
million tons, the USDA said earlier this month.  Brazil  is the world’s biggest producer and exporter of
soybeans, and Argentina is the largest shipper of soy-based
animal feed and cooking oil.  Corn futures for March delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$4.3125 a bushel on the CBOT. The price has tumbled 38 percent
this year on the outlook for a record U.S. crop.  Wheat futures for March delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$6.5925 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
