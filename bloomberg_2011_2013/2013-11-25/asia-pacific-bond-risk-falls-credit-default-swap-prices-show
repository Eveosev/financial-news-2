The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
declined, according to traders of credit default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 3 basis points to 129 basis
points as of 8:20 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is set for its
biggest one-day fall in a week and its lowest close since Sept.
23, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 3 basis points to
100 as of 11:15 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. Thatâ€™s set for its biggest one-day decrease since Oct. 17
and its lowest close since May 21, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 1 basis point to
79.25 basis points as of 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The gauge is poised for its lowest close since
Sept. 19, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
