Palm oil dropped for a second day on
speculation that output in  Malaysia  is poised to climb this
month, adding to the highest stockpiles in six months in the
world’s second-biggest producer.  The contract for delivery in February lost 0.5 percent to
close at 2,629 ringgit ($817) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives. Futures rallied to 2,692 ringgit on Nov. 22, the
highest level for the most-active contract since September 2012,
extending a bull market on concern that output will trail
analysts’ estimates for Indonesia, the biggest supplier.  Malaysia’s output gained about 4.1 percent in the first 20
days of this month according to planters, said Paramalingam Supramaniam, director at brokerage Pelindung Bestari Sdn. in
Selangor. Reserves were at 1.85 million tons in October, the
highest since April, according to the Malaysian  Palm Oil  Board.
The board will release data for November on Dec. 10.  “Higher production may lead to a slight increase in
stockpiles,” said Paramalingam. Inventories may gain 2 percent
in November from a month earlier, he said.  Indonesia raised its palm oil  export tax  to 12 percent for
December from 9 percent this month, Faiz Achmad, director of
food and industry at the Industry Ministry said today. Malaysia
increased its duty on shipments to 5 percent for next month.  Refined palm oil for May delivery gained 0.2 percent to
close at 6,450  yuan  ($1,059) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange .  Soybean oil  climbed 0.2 percent to end at 7,314 yuan.  Soybeans for January delivery lost 0.3 percent to $13.15 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil fell 0.3
percent to 41.34 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
