The judge overseeing  Detroit ’s
bankruptcy case will issue an oral decision Dec. 3 on whether
the city is eligible to remain under court protection, according
to a court filing.  In a two-paragraph order released this afternoon, U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes scheduled a hearing that day to
announce the court ruling.  Detroit filed the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy on July
18, listing about $18 billion in debt and saying it didn’t have
the money to pay bondholders, retirees and employees all it owes
them while still providing basic city services.  Under Chapter 9 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code , which applies
to cities and counties, Detroit must show that it is eligible to
remain in bankruptcy, where it is protected from lawsuits that
might disrupt its effort to restructure.  Rhodes this month presided over a trial in which Michigan’s
Republican Governor  Rick Snyder  testified about the reasons he
authorized the bankruptcy. Unions and groups representing
retired workers argued that the bankruptcy should be thrown out,
claiming Snyder acted illegally by allowing a bankruptcy that
could reduce pensions. Opponents also accused the city of
refusing to negotiate seriously with creditors.  Snyder and Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr testified
that they exhausted all efforts to reach a deal with unions and
other creditors before being forced into bankruptcy, in part by
lawsuits.  The case is City of Detroit, 13-bk-53846,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).  To contact the reporter on this story:
