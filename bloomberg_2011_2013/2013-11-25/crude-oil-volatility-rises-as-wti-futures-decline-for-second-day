Crude options volatility rose as the
underlying futures retreated for a second day.  Implied volatility for at-the-money January options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
17.26 percent at 4 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , up
from 16.13 percent on Nov. 22.  West Texas Intermediate for January delivery fell 75 cents
to settle at $94.09 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices advanced 1.1
percent last week, the first gain in seven weeks.  Calls, or bets that prices would rise, accounted for 56
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most-active
options were January $101 calls, which fell 3 cents to 7 cents a
barrel with 2,284 lots trading as of 4:02 p.m. January $84 puts
declined 1 cent to 4 cents on volume of 2,028.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 59 percent of
the 73,107 lots traded. January $100 calls fell 8 cents to 16
cents a barrel on 2,787 contracts. January $85 puts were
unchanged at 6 cents on volume of 2,513 lots.  Open interest on Nov. 22 was highest for June $80 puts,
with 27,913 contracts. Next were January $75 puts with 27,245
lots and December $120 calls with 25,319.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
