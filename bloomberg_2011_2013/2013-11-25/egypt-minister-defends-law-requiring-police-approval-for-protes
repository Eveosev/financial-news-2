Egyptian authorities defended a new
law that made it illegal to hold demonstrations without the
approval of the police, as rights groups attacked the measure.  Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said the law, signed by
interim president Adly Mansour yesterday, “doesn’t diminish
citizens’ rights to peaceful expression of opinion,” the
ministry said in e-mailed statement today.  Egypt ’s authorities are seeking to stifle daily protests by
Islamist supporters of former President Mohamed Mursi, whose
overthrow by the army in July was followed by a crackdown in
which hundreds of his Islamist supporters were killed. A three-month state of emergency, which granted security forces special
powers, ended earlier this month.  The bill requires at least three days of notice for
protests, and gives security forces the right to bar them as a
threat to public safety. It also bans political gatherings in
mosques, which are regular meeting places for the protesters.  Human rights groups and activists said the law aims to
stifle opposition and will allow repressive police practices and
abuses. Members of the Lawyers Syndicate have threatened to take
to the streets if Mansour doesn’t withdraw the measure within 48
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
