Trafigura Beheer BV’s profit fell 33
percent in its fiscal first nine months on lower oil and metal-price swings and rising costs. The commodity trader cut a stake
in Puma Energy, owner of oil storage and retail gas stations.  Net income declined to $606.8 million in the nine months to
June 30 from $903.2 million in the same period a year earlier,
Amsterdam-based Trafigura said in a  prospectus  for a 500 million
euro ($677 million) bond offer. Net turnover rose 7.4 percent to
$99.1 billion, the world’s second-largest metals trader said.  Trafigura and other commodities traders have been snapping
up assets such as oil terminals, ports, mines and refineries to
counter shrinking margins in the trading business. Glencore
Xstrata Plc, the biggest listed commodities trader, was created
in a $29 billion deal to acquire mining company Xstrata Plc.  Trafigura’s general and administrative costs rose to $1.23
billion from $975 million as depreciation and amortization costs
linked to its growing stable of industrial assets increased.  The company reduced its stake in oil-services company Puma
Energy to 49 percent from 65 percent by divesting part of its
holding to minority shareholders, according to the prospectus.  Sonangol Holdings,  Angola ’s state oil company, paid $500
million to increase its stake in Puma to 30 percent from 20
percent as part of a capital raising for the services unit. The
transaction values Puma, which owns operations in  South America ,
 Asia , Australia and  Africa , at about $5 billion.  Trafigura’s interest in Puma was diluted by 12.5 percent by
Sonangol’s $500 million capital increase. Trafigura also sold
1.9 percent to Cochan Holdings LLC, an Angola investment group,
which maintained its 15 percent interest in Puma.  A new group of shareholders, made up of investors related
to the company, purchased 6 percent of Puma from Trafigura.  “During the year Trafigura sold a 3-1/3 percent stake in
Puma Energy to one of the members of the Board of Directors,”
Trafigura said in the prospectus. A spokesman for the company
wouldn’t identify the board member.  To contact the reporter on this story:
