Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index rebounding from last week’s drop, as the yen
weakened,  Iran  agreed to limit its nuclear program and investors
bet improving U.S. economic data will boost earnings.  Nikon Corp. (7731)  advanced 3.6 percent as the yen touched the
weakest level in almost six months against the dollar, boosting
the outlook for Japanese exporters. Warrnambool Cheese & Butter
Factory Co. climbed 2 percent in Sydney after Saputo Inc. raised
its offer for the dairy. Beadell Resources Ltd. slumped 8.4
percent, leading Australian gold miners lower as the price of
the precious metal retreated after Iran agreed to limit its
nuclear program in exchange for as much as $7 billion of relief
from economic sanctions.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.4 percent to 141.79 as
of 6:59 p.m. in Hong Kong, with nine of the 10 industry groups
on the gauge rising. The measure slid 0.2 percent last week for
the fourth loss in five weeks. The index climbed 9.6 percent
this year as investors bet the Federal Reserve won’t taper its
monthly bond buying before 2014.  Investors “see the economy and corporate earnings growing
at an improved rate with ongoing valuation support from
continued low interest rates,” Ric Spooner, Sydney-based chief
market analyst at stockbroker CMC Markets, said in an e-mail.
“That’s unlikely to be disturbed by the Fed’s taper program.”  Japan’s Topix index gained 0.9 percent and the Nikkei 225
Stock Average rose 1.5 percent as the yen fell as much as 0.6
percent to 101.92 per dollar. Nikon rose 3.6 percent to 1,881
yen. Japan Pile Corp. sank 11 percent to 978 yen after the
construction firm said it will raise as much as 5.15 billion yen
($50.9 million) in a share sale.  Regional Gauges  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 0.3 percent, while
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.1 percent. South Korea’s  Kospi (KOSPI) 
index added 0.5 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index gained
0.3 percent, and  Taiwan ’s Taiex Index increased 0.9 percent.
 China ’s Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent.  India ’s S&P
BSE Sensex Index jumped 1.9 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 13.9 times estimated
earnings on Nov. 22, which is 14 percent below its average of
16.2 during the past 10 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The valuation compares with 16.3 on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 15.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Earnings on the Asia Pacific measure will grow 12 percent
next year and 10 percent in 2015, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S.  home sales  data today are forecast to show an increase
in October from the previous month, adding to reports last week
that showed weekly jobless claims fell to the lowest level since
September and American consumers became less pessimistic this
month.  Fed Stimulus  Minutes of the Fed’s October meeting released Nov. 20
showed officials may reduce their $85 billion a month of bond
buying if the economy improves as anticipated. Stimulus from the
Fed has helped the  S&P 500 (SPX)  soar 167 percent since its March 2009
low. The index has advanced 27 percent this year, poised for its
best annual performance in a decade.  By agreeing to curtail its nuclear activities, Iran won an
easing of certain sanctions on oil, auto parts, gold and
precious metals for six months. The deal, which is reversible,
was announced yesterday after five days of talks in Geneva.  The Iran deal “may provide a more supportive backdrop
across the board in terms of there being less political risk,
but it’s not going to be the key focus of the week,” Chris Green, a strategist in Auckland at First NZ Capital Ltd., said
by telephone.  Topix Performance  Bank of  Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda helped drive a 45
percent surge in Japan’s Topix this year by maintaining
unprecedented monetary easing as he and Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe sought to jolt the nation out of 15 years of deflation. The
Topix is the best performing index of 24 developed markets
tracked by Bloomberg.  Futures on the S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent today. The
index closed at a record high last week, capping a seventh week
of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, also rose for a
seventh week, its longest streak of such gains since January
2011.  Warrnambool Cheese rose 2 percent to A$9.23. Saputo’s
A$9.20 per share cash bid gives its offer a value of A$515
million ($472 million), beating two rival offers for  Australia ’s
oldest dairy producer.  Gold producers declined as the precious metal sank. Beadell
Resources fell 8.4 percent to 76 Australian cents. Silver Lake
Resources Ltd. retreated 8.9 percent to 51 cents. Evolution
Mining Ltd. fell 5.5 percent to 60.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
