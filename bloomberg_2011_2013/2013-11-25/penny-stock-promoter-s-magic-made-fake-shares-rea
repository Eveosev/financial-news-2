Finance shares with art and magic the ability to invest otherwise meaningless bits of the world -- scraps of paper, blocks of computer memory -- with value and power. And financial fraud, which in practice consists mostly of bewildering retirees over the telephone, sometimes seems to have some of the glamour of art forgery, at least when you read Securities and Exchange Commission settlements with an open mind and a pure heart. Today the  SEC announced a settlement  with Curt Kramer, a penny stock promoter, and his companies Mazuma Corporation and affiliates. Kramer and Mazuma bought penny stocks in private transactions, and then re-sold them to public investors in unregistered transactions, which is a no-no, albeit a boring no-no. And  the settlement  plods boringly along until it falls, at paragraph 10, into magic: Umm wait what? True! Here is  the 2012 SEC settlement  with that transfer agent, Steven Bethke: In other words: Bethke did not own any stock in Bederra. What he  did  have was a stack of paper with Bederra's name and some signatures on it. So he thought to himself, well, this paper is pretty much worthless, but it sure  looks  like Bederra stock. 1   Indeed other identical paper is Bederra stock, because someone at Bederra had uttered the appropriate incantations over it. "I dub thee stock," said Bederra's board, and lo, the pieces of paper became stock and represented a fractional undivided ownership interest in the business of Bederra Corporation. Bethke did not have access to the appropriate incantations, since he was not an authorized officer of Bederra; he was just the guy who held on to the paper for safekeeping. But he did have some  inappropriate  incantations, which consisted basically of calling up Kramer 2   and saying "hey I've got some Bederra stock, do you want to buy it?" The  SEC's complaint  against Bethke is frustratingly incomplete but it seems like they believe that Bethke actually managed to sell some stock in Bederra by just pretending real hard that what he had was stock: Notice the word "actual" there. Bederra was telling people that it had 400 million shares outstanding, because it had issued 400 million shares. But the SEC thinks it  actually  had 1.5 billion shares outstanding, because in addition to those 400 million shares that Bederra had issued, the SEC thinks that those 1.1 billion shares that Bethke issued on his own initiative, and without any corporate approval, were also outstanding. His fraudulent sales of fake stock somehow made that fake stock real. Presumably nobody worries about this too much with Bederra -- now Zicix, and apparently  trading at  somewhere between $0.0000 and $0.0001 a share 3  -- but it'd be pretty weird if I could print and sell shares of, like, Berkshire Hathaway, and if they were printed on good enough paper with good enough forged signatures they would actually be  recognized as real Berkshire shares by the SEC . 4  The SEC doesn't really get far into the metaphysics here. Nor do they get into the obvious question, which is: Did Kramer know that his stock was fake? Or did he just know that it was unregistered? He was buying it at a steep discount to public prices, so surely something shady was going on, but the bare-bones complaints are not enough to distinguish exactly what the shadiness was and who was fooling whom about what. Which is fair enough. One purpose of the securities laws is to make cases like this easy for the SEC: If you don't register a public offering, and it's not exempt from registration, you are In Trouble, regardless of whether you're selling shares in a solid valuable company, or shares in a tiny unprofitable company, or, as here,  fake  shares in a tiny unprofitable company. The SEC doesn't need to prove what Kramer or Bethke or anyone else thought about what they were doing; the unregistered sales are all they need. The magic of what these guys did here -- turning worthless paper into ownership of a company,  without that company's knowledge  -- isn't really a concern of the SEC. But it is surprisingly magical. 1  Which incidentally was also pretty much worthless! By April 2009 it was  trading below a penny a share , but I guess you make it up in volume. He sold over 1.1 billion shares, according to the SEC, for $350,000, over 20 transactions. Presumably each transaction was one sheet of paper -- e.g. the first trade, for 2.5 million shares, was presumably one certificate for 2.5 million shares -- so you avoid the "not worth the paper they're printed on" problem. And then, per today's complaint, "Mazuma Holding and Kramer resold the shares to the public for a profit of $934,404."
