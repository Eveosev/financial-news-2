If ever there was a time to visit Panama, this is it. In 2014 its famous canal celebrates 100 years of connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and Panama City is gearing up for the milestone with a slew of major developments.  The celebration kicks off in February with the opening of the Frank Gehry–designed BioMuseo. The $100 million museum, Gehry's first project in Latin America, will contain eight galleries, including two aquariums, dedicated to displaying the country's biodiversity (507-314-0097). On the hotel front, the city's already seen the opening of the Waldorf Astoria Panama (507-294-8000; doubles from $99), the Trump Ocean Club (507-215-8800; doubles from $169), and the Tantalo Hotel (507-262-4030; doubles from $149), but the real talk of the town is the American Trade Hotel, the first Latin American development from the Ace Hotels brand. The 50-room property—opened in November in Casco Viejo, a UNESCO World Heritage neighborhood where dozens of centuries-old buildings are being turned into art galleries, cafés, and microbreweries—features a rooftop pool, a jazz bar, and a farm-to-table restaurant (507-211-2000; doubles from $189). As for eateries, chef Andrés Madrigal, who’s earned a Michelin star and worked with everyone from Ducasse to Arzak, has opened Madrigal, also in Casco, with a focus on Spanish cuisine (Av. A and Calle 5ta Oeste; 507-211-1956; entrées from $22). And in Panama City’s San Francisco neighborhood, on the eastern end of town, is Humo, a standout for its Panamanian barbecue (Calle 70 Este; 507-203-7313; entrées from $16); it was launched by local chef Mario Castre­llón of nearby Maito, where the emphasis is on local ingredients (Calle 50 Este; 507-391-4657; entrées from $16).
