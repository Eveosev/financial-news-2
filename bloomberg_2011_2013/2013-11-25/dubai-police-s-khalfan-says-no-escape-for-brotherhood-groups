Dahi Khalfan, replaced as Dubai
police chief after more than three decades in charge of the
force, warned supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood he’d continue
to monitor their activities.  “O Brotherhood, I want tell you I am in the police and
public security’s top leadership and there’s no escaping me!”
Khalfan posted on his Twitter account on Nov. 23, after last
month being named deputy chairman of police and general
security. He’s succeeded as police commander-in-chief by Major
General Khamis Matar Al Mazeina, who took office Nov. 23.  Officials in the United Arab Emirates have openly opposed
what they say are attempts by  Egypt ’s Muslim Brotherhood to
destabilize the desert nation, emboldened by uprisings across
the Middle East. In July, 69 people were sentenced to seven to
15 years in jail for establishing a secret organization aimed at
threatening the U.A.E.’s sovereignty. The government said the
group had ties to the Brotherhood.  Khalfan, who had run Dubai’s police since 1980, has been
one of the Brotherhood’s most outspoken critics.  The U.A.E. pledged aid to Egypt following the military’s
ouster of Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Mursi in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
