Japan ’s output of copper and copper-alloy fabricated products increased 5.6 percent in October,
climbing for the fourth straight month, as demand from home and
overseas expanded, an industry group said.  Production, including sheets and tubes, rose to 69,540
metric tons last month from 65,866 tons a year earlier, the
Japan Copper & Brass Association said today in a statement,
citing preliminary data. Output was 66,710 tons in September, up
4.8 percent from a year ago.  Japan’s total exports grew 18.6 percent in October,
exceeding the median estimate of 16.2 percent in a Bloomberg
survey. The nation posted its biggest October trade deficit on
record after costs for imported fuel surged in the wake of the
nuclear industry’s shutdown. Imports climbed 26.1 percent,
according to government data on Nov. 20.  The industry’s production for exports rose 20 percent to
11,295 tons last month from a year earlier, expanding for a
seventh month, the group said. Output for domestic consumption
gained for the second straight month, rising 3.2 percent to
58,245 tons, according to the association.  The country’s copper wire and cable shipments rose 11
percent to 66,400 tons in October from a year ago, the  Japanese
Electric Wire and Cable Makers’ Association  said on Nov. 20.
Shipments totaled 59,969 tons in September, up 4 percent from a
year earlier, data showed.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell 0.2 percent to $7,081 ton at 12:36 p.m. in  Tokyo ,
brining losses this year to 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
