Holiday shopping on London's Oxford Street has always had something of a frenzied pace. I personally think that—particularly on Christmas Eve—there should be two lanes on the sidewalk, one for the leisurely "just picking up a few last stocking fillers," and a faster one for "I have been drunk all December and haven't bought a single thing yet. Move!" Iconic department store  Selfridges  may have found a speedy solution for the less-well-prepared shopper (read: men) with a new drive-through service—a world first that started Nov. 15. Customers can order their goods from the Selfridges website before whizzing over to the store to collect the goods roadside from the comfort of their cars. Apparently the whole pick-up process can take less than three minutes—which even makes it viable if you're in a black cab and the meter's running. Maybe Santa should check it out…if so, then  this is the area of the Selfridges site  I'd like him to concentrate on. More From  Conde Nast Traveler :
