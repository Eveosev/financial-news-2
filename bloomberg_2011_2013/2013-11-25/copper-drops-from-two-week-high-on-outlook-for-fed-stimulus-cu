Copper declined for the first time
in four days on concern that the  Federal Reserve  may start
reducing stimulus in coming months amid improving U.S. economic
data, reducing the demand outlook for the metal.  The contract for delivery in three months on the  London 
Metal Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to $7,051.25 a metric
ton and traded at $7,061.50 by 4:19 p.m. in Tokyo. The metal
touched $7,133.75 earlier, the highest level since Nov. 12.  U.S. job openings climbed to a five-year high in September,
according to data Nov. 22, with a report today projected to show
pending home sales rebounded last month. Minutes of the Fed’s
October meeting released Nov. 20 showed officials may reduce
their $85 billion a month of bond buying if the economy improves
as anticipated.  “Signs of an improving U.S. economy will encourage the Fed
to cut stimulus sooner,” said Kaname Gokon, deputy manager of
research at Okato Shoji Co. in  Tokyo .  Further losses in copper prices would be limited as
stockpiles declined in Shanghai and London, while geopolitical
risks also eased following  Iran ’s accord with world powers to
limit its nuclear program, he said.  Iran agreed yesterday to curtail its nuclear activities in
return for easing of some sanctions on oil, auto parts, gold and
precious metals. Copper stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange fell 11 percent last week, the most since
December 2011,  data  showed. Stockpiles monitored by the LME
dropped to the lowest since February.  Copper for delivery in February on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange closed little changed at 50,500  yuan  ($8,288) a ton.
The contract for delivery in March slid 0.4 percent to $3.207 a
pound on the Comex in  New York .  On the LME, aluminum, zinc, nickel, tin and lead also
declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
