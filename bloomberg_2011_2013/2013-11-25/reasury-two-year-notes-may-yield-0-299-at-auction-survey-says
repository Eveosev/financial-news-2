The Treasury Department’s $32
billion sale of two-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.299
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in November 2015, yielded 0.31
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. Last month’s sale of the securities yielded 0.323 percent,
and the record auction low was 0.22  percent  on July 24, 2012.  The size of today’s offering is the same as last month’s
sale, the first time the Treasury has maintained the amount of
the auction since it began reducing it by $1 billion a month
from $35 billion in August, the  longest stretch  of reductions
since October 2010. The amount of the securities sold each month
peaked at $44 billion from October 2009 through April 2010.  The Oct. 24 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.32, up from 3.09 the previous month. The average ratio for the
past 10 auctions was 3.28.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 29 percent of the securities at
the October sale. The average for the past 10 auctions is 24.2
percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 31 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 22.7
percent at the past 10 sales.  Two-year notes have returned 0.4 percent this year,
compared with a loss of 2.5 percent by the broad Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
two-year securities gained 0.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
in total rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $96 billion. The government will sell $35 billion
in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year
securities on Nov. 27. This week’s auctions will redeeem $64.4
billion of maturing securities while raising $31.6 billion of
new cash.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  #<617928.7180051.3.9.1.0.25>#
