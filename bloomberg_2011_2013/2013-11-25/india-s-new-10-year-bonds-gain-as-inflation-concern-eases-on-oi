India’s new 10-year bonds advanced
on speculation a drop in  oil prices  will help cool inflation and
reduce pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates .  Brent crude  sank 2.3 percent today after Iran agreed to
limit its nuclear program in return for easing some economic
sanctions imposed by developed nations.  Wholesale prices  in
India, which imports about 80 percent of its oil, rose 7 percent
in October from a year earlier, the fastest pace since February,
data showed this month. The rupee strengthened 0.6 percent
today, the most among Asian currencies.  “The currency’s appreciation is providing some relief to
the bond markets on the inflation front,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, Mumbai-based executive vice-president of treasury at
Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. “We’re also seeing gains as there is less
supply in the newly issued 10-year bond.”  The yield on the 8.83 percent notes due November 2023,
which were first issued on Nov. 22, fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 8.73 percent as of 10:30 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to prices from the central bank’s trading
system. The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 dropped
to 9.09 percent from a three-month high of 9.10 percent at the
end of last week.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will study data, including food
prices and exchange-rate depreciation, before deciding whether
to increase the benchmark rate for a third straight meeting,
Governor  Raghuram Rajan  said Nov. 13. He raised the key
 repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent on Oct. 29,
the second consecutive increase, to curb inflation.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, declined four
basis points to 8.58 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
