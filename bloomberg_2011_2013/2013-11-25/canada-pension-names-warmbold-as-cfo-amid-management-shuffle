Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
named Benita Warmbold chief financial officer as part of a
management shuffle at the countryâ€™s largest retirement-fund
manager.  Warmbold, the chief operations officer, is swapping roles
with CFO Nick Zelenczuk as part of a realignment, Toronto-based
Canada Pension said today in a statement. Zelenczuk becomes
responsible for operations, technology and planning as COO. The
changes are effective Dec. 1, Linda Sims, a spokeswoman, said in
a telephone interview.  Canada Pension also named Mark Machin, a former  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  banker who joined the pension-fund manager last
year to oversee its Asia unit, as head of international
investment. Alain Carrier, managing director of  Europe  and
global head of infrastructure, private investments, will be in
charge of Europe, reporting to Machin.  Canada Pension, which manages retirement savings for 18
million people in every province except  Quebec , has investments
in equities, real estate, infrastructure and fixed-income. The
firm oversaw C$192.8 billion ($182.6 billion) of assets as of
Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
