     Nov. 25 (Bloomberg) --Gasoline followed  Brent crude  lower
after an accord that limits  Iran’s nuclear program  and eases
some economic sanctions.  Futures fell as much as 2.4 percent while Brent crude
declined 1.4 percent on the London ICE Futures exchange.  Iran ’s
crude exports will be capped at about 1 million barrels a day
under an agreement with six world powers. The deal was announced
yesterday in Geneva.  “Today is all about Iran and Brent is down,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New
York. “This deal could be the beginning of having more
significant Iranian supply on the market next year and it will
add some supply in the near term.”  Gasoline for December delivery slid 2.98 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.6963 a gallon at 9:58 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 9.4 percent below the
100-day average.  Brent for January settlement declined $1.62 to $109.43 a
barrel, the first decline in four days.  The six-month agreement, which offers Iran about $7 billion
in relief from sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear
program, leaves in place banking and financial measures that
have hampered its crude exports.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 34 cents to
$18.69 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to European benchmark Brent
rose 40 cents to $3.22.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for December delivery fell 3.12
cents, or 1 percent, to $3.0101 a gallon. Volume was 53 percent
above the average.  ULSD’s  premium  over WTI narrowed 37 cents to $32.44 a
barrel. The crack  spread  versus Brent rose 35 cents to $16.95.  U.S.  pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.5 cent to
$3.28 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today. Prices
are the highest since Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
