An Indian couple were found guilty
of the murder of their teenage daughter and their domestic
servant in a case that drew national attention.  Rajesh Talwar and his wife Nupur Talwar, both dentists,
will be sentenced tomorrow after being found guilty of the
murders more than five years ago and destroying evidence, B.K.
Singh, a lawyer for the  Central Bureau of Investigation , which
probed the case, told reporters today in televised comments.  The Talwars -- who have always denied the charges -- said
they were “deeply disappointed” and “anguished” by the
verdict, the Press Trust of  India  reported. Rebecca John, a
lawyer for the Talwars, said she will appeal the ruling.  The prosecution argued that the Talwars killed their
daughter after they found her and their male servant in an
objectionable position. In India, where traditional and modern
values frequently clash, it is common for newspapers to report
about family members accused of murdering their children in so-called honor killings.  The police were criticized after originally accusing Hemraj
Banjade, the servant, of being behind the attack only to find
his battered dead body a day later on the terrace of the
Talwars’ apartment, located in Noida near the Indian capital New
Delhi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
