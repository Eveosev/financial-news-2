Canadian  stocks  were little changed
as gold and crude prices slumped after  Iran  and world powers
reached an interim accord on the country’s nuclear program.  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  gained 2 percent after the smartphone maker
replaced its chief financial officer and two other top
executives as it tries to turn around the struggling smartphone
maker.  Detour Gold Corp. (DGC) , the worst-performing stock in the
 Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  this year, plunged 23
percent after its chief executive officer resigned. Kirkland
Lake Gold Inc. sank 12 percent after saying its second-quarter
gold production was lower than previously reported.  The S&P/TSX fell 10.07 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to
13,468.27 at 9:57 a.m. in Toronto. The benchmark equity gauge
has risen 8.4 percent this year.  Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear activities and in return
won an easing of “certain sanctions” on oil, auto parts, gold
and precious metals. The deal, which is reversible, was
announced yesterday after five days of talks in Geneva. Gold
plunged to the lowest level in more than four months as the
accord damped demand for a haven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
