Babcock International Group Plc and
Avincis Mission Critical Services Group SA said they’re in
exclusive talks about setting up a joint venture.  The deal fits with Babcock’s strategy of expanding in
Britain and overseas, the engineering company helping design the
U.K.’s future submarines said after the Sunday Times reported it
was in advanced talks to take over Avincis. The companies
confirmed they’re in joint-venture discussions in separate e-mailed statements.  Babcock and Avincis, a helicopter-service provider based in
 Spain , said there’s no certainty the talks will lead to an
agreement. The companies said they will make further statements
if and when appropriate.  Babcock has gained 37 percent this year. The London-based
company published its first-half results on Nov. 12, reporting
underlying revenue rose 9 percent to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.8
billion) and underlying operating profit increased 9 percent to
172.8 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
