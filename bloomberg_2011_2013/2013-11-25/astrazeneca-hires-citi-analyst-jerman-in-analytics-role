AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  said Joanne Jerman,
a European health equity analyst at Citigroup Inc., will join
the U.K. drugmaker as a director in the global analytics and
intelligence team.  Jerman will focus on respiratory, inflammation and
autoimmune diseases, AstraZeneca spokeswoman Vanessa Rhodes said
in an e-mailed response to a request for comment.  Jerman  was
based in London covering drugmakers including  Almirall SA (ALM)  and
Stada Arzneimittel AG.  Other analysts who have joined pharmaceutical companies
include Jack Scannell, who left Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. in
February to work in drug discovery at e-Therapeutics Plc, a U.K.
company thatâ€™s developing medicines for cancer and depression.
James Dodwell, a director of investor relations at
GlaxoSmithKline Plc in London, was  formerly  an analyst at
Jefferies and Credit Suisse Group AG.  Citi recently hired Peter Verdult, who left  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
to join his former colleague and head pharmaceuticals analyst
 Andrew Baum  in London, a person familiar with that move said in
September. Verdult had left Citi to work for Morgan Stanley in
2009.  A spokesman for Citi in London declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
