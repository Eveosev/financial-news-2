The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
fell, after seven consecutive weekly gains that lifted the gauge
to a record, as energy shares retreated following  Iran ’s
agreement to limit its nuclear program.  Schlumberger Ltd. and Noble Corp. declined more than 3.2
percent as crude oil slipped. An index of airlines reached an
almost seven-year high amid optimism fuel costs may drop.  Alcoa
Inc. (AA)  climbed 3.8 percent and Caterpillar Inc. rose 1.8 percent
after analysts recommended buying the shares.  The S&P 500 dropped 0.1 percent to 1,802.48 at 4 p.m. in
 New York , erasing earlier gains of as much as 0.2 percent. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 7.77 points, or 0.1 percent,
to an all-time high of 16,072.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index
rose 0.1 percent to 3,994.57, after briefly surpassing 4,000 for
the first time since September 2000. About 5.6 billion shares
 changed hands  on U.S. exchanges, about 7.8 percent below the
three-month average.  “The market is not necessarily over-extended, but probably
moderately rich,” Cam Albright, director of  asset allocation  at
the investment advisory unit of Wilmington Trust, said by phone
from Wilmington. The firm oversees about $79 billion. “It’s
probably difficult to envision this market getting a lot more
upside unless it has this continued success on earnings and
economic growth. The deal with Iran takes some of the  risk
premium  out of the marketplace for the moment at least.”  Iran Accord  Iran agreed yesterday to curtail nuclear activities in
return for easing of some sanctions on oil, auto parts, gold and
precious metals, an accord that broke a decade-long deadlock.  The S&P 500 has  rallied 26 percent  this year, closing for
the first time above 1,800 on Nov. 22, as the  Federal Reserve 
continued to buy $85 billion of bonds a month to stimulate
economic growth. The gauge is challenging 2003 for the best
annual gain since 1998.  The index is trading for about 17 times its companies’
reported earnings. While the  valuation  reached the highest level
since May 2010, it’s still below the multiples at the market’s
two previous peaks, when the ratio reached 17.5 in October 2007
and 31 in March 2000, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Minutes from the latest Fed meeting indicated the central
bank may reduce monetary stimulus in coming months. Four out of
five investors expect the Fed to delay a decision to begin
reducing the stimulus until March 2014 or later, according to
the Bloomberg Global Poll of investors, traders and analysts who
are subscribers. Just 5 percent are looking for a move at its
Dec. 17-18 meeting, the Nov. 19 poll showed.  Most Bullish  “The most bullish thing you could have is the Fed says,
‘Hey, we feel comfortable enough to step away,’” Warren Koontz,
the co-manager of the Loomis Sayles Value Fund in  Boston , said
in a phone interview. Loomis Sayles & Co. manages about $191
billion. “The underpinning of the stock market is probably
pretty good.”  The  S&P 500  last week capped its longest winning streak
since February as reports showed retail sales beat estimates and
fewer Americans than expected filed for jobless benefits.  Data today from the National Association of Realtors showed
pending home sales fell 0.6 percent in October, a fifth month of
declines, amid higher borrowing costs. The median projection in
a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 1 percent gain
from the month before.  “The real strong rebound in housing that we saw between
2011 and the first quarter of this year has tapered off now,”
Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Pittsburgh-based Fort
Pitt Capital Group Inc., said in a phone interview. His firm
oversees $1.5 billion. “The question people have is, ‘Can the
uptrend in housing be sustained by what classically has been
growth in income and therefore the ability to get loans?’”  Volatility Gauge  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index rose
4.3 percent today to 12.79. The gauge of S&P 500  options  known
as the VIX trimmed its 2013 decline to 29 percent.  Seven of the 10 main S&P 500 groups fell. Energy shares
slumped 0.8 percent for the worst performance, as prices for
crude, gasoline and heating oil fell following the interim deal
with Iran.  Schlumberger (SLB) , the world’s largest oilfield services
provider, dropped 3.2 percent to $89.81. Noble, an offshore rig
contractor, slipped 4.1 percent to $37.94.  ADT Corp. slumped 5.8 percent to $41.46. The largest
provider of home security agreed to buy back 10.2 million shares
from Corvex Management LP for $44.01 each. Keith Meister,
founder of Corvex, will  resign  from ADT’s board of directors.  Airlines Rally  The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index added 1.6 percent to the
highest level since February 2007, on optimism a decline in fuel
costs will help profit. Delta Air Lines Inc. rose 2 percent to a
record $29.17 and United Continental Holdings Inc. gained 3.4
percent to $39.83.  Alcoa gained 3.8 percent to $9.59. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
upgraded the shares of the largest U.S. aluminum maker to buy
from neutral. The brokerage said the stock may climb to $11.  “We believe that the market is not fully appreciating
Alcoa’s solid position in growing value-added and high-margin
aluminum products for the aerospace and automotive industries,”
analysts Sal Tharani and Chelsea Bolton wrote.  Caterpillar added 1.8 percent to $84.40. Bank of America
Corp. raised the world’s largest maker of mining equipment to
buy from neutral, saying the power-systems business will help
earnings next year.  Health-Care Shares  Health-care companies rose the most among 10 S&P 500
industries, climbing 0.4 percent. Mylan Inc., a generic
drugmaker, advanced 3.6 percent to $44.22. The stock has gained
11 of the past 12 sessions to close at a record. Biogen Idec
Inc. increased 3.6 percent to $295.88.  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., a provider of kidney care
services, jumped 8.9 percent to $61.55 for the biggest gain in
the S&P 500. U.S. regulators scrapped a proposed 9.4 percent
reduction in Medicare payments to dialysis providers.  Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates Inc., said
the four-year  bull market  will keep going because optimism about
the rally hasn’t overtaken concern about company earnings and
valuations.  The lack of exuberance shows people aren’t fully invested
and have money left to buy shares, according to Birinyi, one of
the first money managers to advise clients to buy in 2009.  “We still haven’t heard the story about the barista in
Starbucks who’s made a lot of money in the market,” he said in
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart” with
 Trish Regan  and  Adam Johnson  on Nov. 22. “We’re not there
yet.”  Investors have added to options that provide protection in
the event of a market plunge, based on the CBOE SKEW Index. The
gauge uses the prices of short-term, out-of-the-money S&P 500
options to calculate the market’s perception of the probability
for a tail-risk event.  The  SKEW index  rose to 137 on Nov. 18 as the Fed considered
scaling back its bond-purchasing program and American lawmakers
prepared for another round of budget talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
