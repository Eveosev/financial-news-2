England defender Ashley Cole will
sign a new contract with Chelsea in the coming days, Sky Sports
reported, citing interim manager Rafael Benitez.  Cole, whose current deal runs out at the end of this
season, had been linked with possible moves to Real Madrid and
Paris Saint-Germain.  “I am really pleased, the paperwork has to be done but the
agreement is there,” Sky cited Benitez as saying after today’s
2-1 win over Arsenal.  Frank Lampard is also out of contract at the end of this
campaign and looks likely to leave Chelsea, Sky added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
