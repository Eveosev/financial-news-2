Atletico Madrid  cut Barcelona’s lead
atop La Liga to eight points with a 2-0 victory against Levante
yesterday.  Inter Milan  tied 1-1 in Italian soccer’s Serie A.  Adrian Lopez and Koke scored for Atletico as it took
advantage of Barcelona’s first league defeat of the season, 3-2
at Real Sociedad on Jan. 19. It was Atletico’s 12th straight
home win in the league, matching the club record set in games
bridging the 1939-40 and 1940-41 seasons.  Cristiano Ronaldo  and Angel di Maria each scored twice as
Real Madrid cruised to a 5-0 win at Valencia. Barcelona has 55
points, with Atletico on 47 and Real on 40 in third place.  Osasuna beat Deportivo La Coruna 2-1 to climb two spots to
18th in the 20-team standings, with its opponent dropping into
last place.  Francesco Totti  put Roma ahead in the 22nd minute with a
penalty kick and Rodrigo Palacio tied it for Inter in added time
at the end of the first half.  Inter is in fourth place in Serie A with 39 points.
Defending champion Juventus leads with 48 points, with Napoli
and Lazio on 43 points.  Juventus rebounded from a two-match winless run in the
league to defeat Udinese 4-0 two days ago. Napoli and Lazio drew
1-1 at Fiorentina and 2-2 at Palermo respectively.  Among yesterday’s games, AC Milan beat Bologna with two
goals from Giampaolo Pazzini and bottom club Siena won 1-0
against Sampdoria.  PSG Wins  Paris Saint-Germain moved level on points with Lyon atop

defeat defending champion Montpellier 3-2 two days ago with an
injury-time winner from Andre-Pierre Gignac.  In the first round of games since the Bundesliga’s winter
break,  Bayern Munich  defeated last-place Greuther Fuerth 2-0 on
Jan. 19 to maintain its nine-point lead.  Mario Mandzukic got both goals for Bayern, which has 45

Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola as its next manager to replace
Jupp Heynckes, who’ll retire when his contract expires after the
season.  Second-place  Bayer Leverkusen  won 3-1 against Eintracht
Frankfurt, which is another six points back along with  Borussia
Dortmund  -- a 5-0 winner at Werder Bremen.  Yesterday, Hamburg tied 1-1 at Nurnberg, and Augsburg won
3-2 at Fortuna Dusseldorf.  Ajax took advantage of slips by  FC Twente  and  PSV Eindhoven 
as Dutch soccer’s Eredivisie restarted, winning 3-0 against
fourth-place Feyenoord yesterday.  The defending champion joins PSV on 40 points, one behind
Twente. PSV suffered a 3-1 home defeat to Zwolle on Jan. 18,
while Twente was held to a scoreless tie by  RKC Waalwijk  two
