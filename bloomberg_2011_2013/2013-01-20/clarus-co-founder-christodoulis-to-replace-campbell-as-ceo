Clarus Securities Inc. said Jim Christodoulis will replace Rod Campbell as president and chief
executive officer of the Toronto-based investment bank.  Christodoulis, 39, co-founded Clarus, which provides
 investment banking  for mining, oil-and-gas and so-called special
situations companies, in 2003, the company said yesterday in a
memo.  Clarus is “a research-driven shop, picking good ideas from
those three silos,” Christodoulis said today in a telephone
interview.  About half of Clarus’s investment-banking business comes
from the mining sector, participating in recent financing of
firms including  Perseus Mining Ltd. (PRU)  and  PMI Gold Corp. (PMV)  The
company is expanding its non-resource business in sectors such
as technology.  “We’re seeing a number of great technology names, a number
of great industrial names,” Christodoulis said. “These are
stories that have been forgotten, at least from a Bay Street
standpoint or a broker standpoint.”  In the last month, Clarus hired former Canadian technology
analyst Mark Pavan as a managing director of corporate finance
in technology and other industries. The company also hired gold
analyst Ron Stewart from Dundee Capital Markets Inc. as its
managing director of corporate finance for gold companies.  Oracle Mining Corp. (OMN)  said yesterday Campbell joined the
Vancouver-based company as its president. He’ll be responsible
for evaluating strategic opportunities and coordinating capital-
market activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
