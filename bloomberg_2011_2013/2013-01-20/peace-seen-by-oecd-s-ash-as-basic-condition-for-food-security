The experience of African countries
shows peace is a basic condition for  food security , said Ken Ash, director for trade and agriculture at the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development. Following are comments he
made at the Global Forum for Food and Agriculture in Berlin
yesterday:  “If you take out of the picture in sub-Saharan Africa
those countries that are in conflict, the remaining countries
have made tremendous progress in food security. Peace is a basic
condition.”  “There isn’t much disagreement these days about the need
to invest in agriculture. Returns on investment in research and
development in agriculture are enormous, the numbers are almost
beyond belief, but the lag time is really long. Maybe it’s time
now to move onto the action phase of this particular debate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
