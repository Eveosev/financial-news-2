Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s party and
its Free Democrat ally may retain power in Germany’s fourth
biggest state by population, an exit poll showed.  Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union  won 37 percent of the
votes in Lower Saxony elections today while the FDP took 9.5
percent, the exit poll on ZDF television showed. That might
allow Prime Minister David McAllister to continue the CDU’s
decade-old coalition with the FDP.  The Social Democrats got 33 percent and the Greens 13.5
percent, making the result a tie. The party winning the most
votes in German elections is given first right to form a
coalition.  Among the parties failing the 5 percent threshold are the
anti-capitalist Left Party and the Pirate Party, which campaigns
for Internet freedom.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
