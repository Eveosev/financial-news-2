Dubai’s benchmark stock index rose
to the highest level in almost three years led by  Emaar
Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  on investor optimism a real estate recovery in
the emirate is set to continue this year.  Emaar, the developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper
which said it started the development of a residential project
in Dubai, surged to the highest level since 2009.  Union
Properties PJSC (UPP) , another Dubai-based developer, soared 6.3
percent. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  jumped 1 percent to
1,791.73, the highest level since April 2010, at the close in
the emirate. About 551  million shares  were traded today, triple
the 12-month daily average.  The Emaar news “sent a positive wave across real estate
companies on the DFM,” said Samer Darwiche, Dubai-based analyst
at Gulfmena Investments Ltd. “If Emaar is re-launching
projects, it means there is demand on real estate and thus other
companies should be doing the same.”  Dubai’s property market is recovering as the emirate’s
tourism, hotel and restaurant industries grew last year after a
2008 crash sent  home prices  tumbling more than 65 percent. The
emirate’s economy may have expanded 5 percent in 2012, the
fastest pace since 2007, according to government forecasts.
Positive trends in the property sector are set to continue in
2013,  Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA)  said in an e-mailed note today, raising
Emaar’s price estimate 23 percent to 4.94 dirhams.  Emaar’s Apartments  Emaar, which has the  heaviest weighting  on Dubai’s index,
said yesterday it started developing the Address Residence
Fountain Views in Dubai, which comprises 280 apartments. The
company may post a 15  percent increase  in 2012 net income,
according to the average estimate of 11 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The shares rose 4.1 percent to 4.30 dirhams, the
highest level since November 2009.  Union Properties gained to 47 fils, the highest level since
April 12. The company is poised to return to profit in 2012,
according to an EFG-Hermes Holding SAE estimate compiled by
Bloomberg.  The DFM General Index’s 14-day  relative strength index  rose
to 81 today. A reading above 70 indicates to some analysts that
a security or index is poised to decline. The measure was the
Gulf Cooperation Council’s best-performer last year with a gain
of 20 percent.  Gates Buying  In North Africa,  Egypt ’s benchmark EGX 30 Index increased
0.4 percent at the close in Cairo after Orascom Construction
Industries, the country’s biggest publicly traded company, said
investors led by  Bill Gates  will buy a stake. Orascom, which
rose 1.9 percent today, said it will consolidate its Cairo and
London-traded shares into a listing on the NYSE Euronext
Amsterdam, backed by $2 billion of investments to fund purchases
of Cairo stock at 280 Egyptian pounds a share.  “The news is positive for the company but negative for the
market,” Mohamed Radwan, head of international sales at Pharos
Holding in Cairo, said by phone. “For the short term, I doubt
today’s gains will be sustained. At the rate things are going,
Egypt is definitely not at the top of the list for  Middle East 
and North Africa fund managers.” Orascom accounts for 24.9
percent of the EGX 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Elsewhere in the Middle East,  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI) 
gained 0.6 percent and Kuwait’s  gauge  advanced 0.3 percent.
Oman’s MSM30 Index and Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) 
increased 0.1 percent while the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  of the
biggest companies in the Gulf and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  were little
changed. Bahrain’s  measure  slipped 0.1 percent.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  dropped 1.5 percent at the close in
Tel Aviv. The yield on the government’s benchmark 4.25 percent
bonds due 2023 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 4.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
