Naguib Sawiris, the media and
telecommunications billionaire, plans to return to serving  Egypt 
and participating in its development, even amid “fundamental”
differences with the ruling Muslim Brotherhood, he wrote in the
Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper today.  Sawiris, who sold his ONTV news television channel to
Tunisian businessman Tarak Ben Ammar in December, said he left
Egypt “despaired and grieved” when he saw that the goals of
the revolution were being stolen and the opposition divided.  He critiqued the government of Islamist president Mohamed Mursi and his allies in the Muslim Brotherhood for “taking over
the legislative and executive apparatuses of the state,
dominating the economy and changing its identity, excluding the
opposition, and silencing the media.”  Mursi was elected in June 2012 after the Muslim
Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party won a majority of seats
in the 2011 Parliamentary elections.  Sawiris said he welcomed Brotherhood businessman Hassan
Malek’s call for Egyptian investors abroad to return to Egypt.
Sawiris founded the liberal Free Egyptians Party after the 2011
uprising. It won 15 of 332 seats in the 2011 elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
