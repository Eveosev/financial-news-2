Viktoria Rebensburg won a women’s
super-G in Cortina d’Ampezzo,  Italy , as World Cup leader Tina Maze finished third to extend her lead in the overall standings.
Felix Neureuther topped the men’s slalom in Wengen, Switzerland.  Germany’s Rebensburg, 23, was 0.33 second faster than
Nicole Schmidhofer of Austria with Slovenia’s Maze another 0.01
second back.  Maze takes over atop the super-G standings from  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S., while the 29-year-old leads the overall
competition with 1,474 points -- 718 ahead of second-place Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany.  Germany’s Neureuther, 28, ended a run of three straight
slalom wins by overall World Cup leader Marcel Hirscher of
Austria, who was second today. Croatia’s Ivica Kostelic finished
third.  Hirscher, 23, leads Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal by 188
points in the overall competition, while Neureuther is 114
points adrift in second spot in the slalom standings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
