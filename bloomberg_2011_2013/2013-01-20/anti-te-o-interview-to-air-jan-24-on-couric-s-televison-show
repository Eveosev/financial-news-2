An interview with Manti Te’o will be
shown on Katie Couric’s television show on Jan. 24.  Former Notre Dame linebacker Te’o denied this week in an
off-camera interview with ESPN that he was part of a hoax that
involved the faked death of an invented girlfriend. Te’o denied
that he fabricated the story to gain an edge in voting for the
Heisman Trophy. He was runner-up to Texas A&M quarterback Johnny
Manziel.  Excerpts from his encounter with Couric will be aired on
ABC news shows prior to the broadcast of the full interview,
Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC and ESPN, said in an e-mailed
news release.  Te’o, who has been preparing for the National Football
League draft at the IMG Training Academy in Bradenton,  Florida ,
will be interviewed along with his parents, Brian and Ottilia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
