Jamie Donaldson carded a 4-under-par
final round of 68 today to overhaul overnight leader Justin Rose
at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship and win his second title on
golf’s European Tour.  The 37-year-old from  Wales  finished on 14-under for the
tournament, one shot ahead of England’s Rose and Thorbjorn
Olesen of  Denmark . Portugal’s Ricardo Santos was 11-under.  Donaldson, who collects a check for 336,725 euros
($448,550), bogeyed the final hole, giving Rose and Olesen a
chance to force a playoff with a birdie. Both made only par.  “It’s pretty surreal really, I’ve played really good all
week although I’ve got away with murder up the last,” Donaldson
told the European Tour’s website. “I thought one of them would
hole if not both, but when both putts slipped by it was my
week.”  Donaldson’s previous European Tour win was at the Irish
Open in July.  Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods of the
U.S., the top two in the Official World Golf Ranking, both
failed to make the halfway cut this week. Woods missed out after
a two-shot penalty in his second round.  It was McIlroy’s first tournament since he joined Woods as
a player sponsored by Nike Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
