CVR Partners had a release of
anhydrous ammonia from a flare at its plant in Coffeyville,
 Kansas , according to a  filing  with the National Response Center.  The release at 7:30 p.m. local time yesterday wasn’t
secured and was more than 100 pounds, according to the filing.
 Bloomberg News  couldn’t immediately verify that the information
in the NRC filing was accurate.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
