  Egypt  agreed to export 1,978 metric
tons of cotton in the week ended Jan. 17, according to the
Alexandria Cotton Exporters Association.  The country has shipped 33,115 tons of the fiber, valued at
$95.1 million, since Sept. 1, the association said today in its
weekly bulletin. Exports last week included 46 tons of the Giza
88 variety and 1,932 tons of Giza 86, it said.  Egypt produces the worldâ€™s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India 
are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
