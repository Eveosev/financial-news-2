Saudi Arabia  exported 1.7 percent
less crude in November than in the previous month, while Iraq
and five other OPEC producers also curbed shipments, according
to the Joint Organizations Data Initiative.  The kingdom, the largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, shipped 7.15 million barrels a
day in November as it reduced monthly output by 2.4 percent to
9.49 million barrels a day. Iraq, with the second-biggest
producer in OPEC, trimmed its exports by 3.3 percent to 2.62
million barrels a day even as it pumped 1.7 percent more oil,
data posted today on the initiative’s website showed.  Angola cut crude exports by 5.6 percent, the  United Arab
Emirates  pared shipments by 3.1 percent, and Qatar, Ecuador and
 Venezuela  also reduced exports, the data showed. Algeria’s
shipments surged 42 percent in November to 725,000 barrels a
day, while its production slipped 2.7 percent, according to the
initiative known as JODI.  OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
said in a monthly report on Jan. 16 that its total output in
December dropped by 465,000 barrels a day to 30.4 million, the
lowest level since October 2011. Saudi Arabia led the decrease
in December, the 12-member group said, citing secondary sources.
OPEC’s figure for production last month is 800,000 barrels a day
more than what the group estimates it will need to supply to
consumers in 2013.  Burning Crude  JODI, supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, uses statistics supplied by national governments to
compile data on production, imports and exports for oil-
producing and consuming nations. The data include crude and
condensates and exclude natural gas liquids.  Saudi Arabia used less crude as fuel in  power plants  in
November, burning 367,000 barrels a day, the lowest level since
last March and a 23 percent reduction from a year ago, according
to JODI. The country also reduced its consumption of diesel and
fuel oil in November, two other fuels used in power stations,
the data showed.  Refineries in the kingdom processed 1.78 million barrels a
day of crude that month, 53,000 barrels a day more on average
than in October, according to the initiative.  Kuwait ,  Iran ,  Nigeria , and  Libya  didn’t submit data for the
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
