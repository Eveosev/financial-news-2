IDB Development Corp.’s 2018  bonds 
dropped the most in four months after Standard & Poor’s Maalot
lowered the Israeli investment company’s credit rating on
concern it may struggle to pay debt.  Government bonds  fell.  The 4.5 percent notes maturing June 2018 slumped 3.3
percent, sending the yield down 1.81 percentage points, set for
the biggest drop since Sept. 24, to 19.81 percent as of 12:26
p.m. in  Tel Aviv . The 4.25 percent benchmark government bonds
due 2023 yielded 4.05 percent, up two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, taking the three-day gain to nine basis
points.  S&P cut IDB Development’s rating by three grades to ilB,
five levels below investment grade, citing “weak” funding and
unsustainable high leverage, according to a Jan. 17  statement  to
the Tel Aviv bourse. The company may fall 1 billion shekels
($268 million) short of cash to cover debt and costs in 2014,
S&P said. The yield on IDB Development’s notes soared 13.5
percentage points last year.  “IDB maybe facing difficulties in getting the approvals
necessary to sell assets as it seeks debt financing sources,”
said Gil Chen, a bond trader at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “The negative environment is
pushing down its bonds.”  IDB Development approached  Koor Industries Ltd. (KOR)  to start
talks to sell a full or partial stake in  Clal Insurance
Enterprises Holdings Ltd. (CLIS) , Tel Aviv-based Koor said Jan. 17. IDB
Development owns 55 percent of the insurer and a direct 13
percent stake in Koor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Very Challenging’  IDB Development’s downgrade comes as its parent company,
 IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH) , seeks funds to avoid defaulting on 2 billion
shekels of debt after bondholders on Jan. 7 rejected a
settlement proposal. IDB Holding  shares  slumped 3.5 percent,
headed for the biggest drop since Dec. 27.  “The intention of IDB to sell a stake in Clal is positive
but the approval process will be very challenging and we see a
risk to the execution of a deal,” S&P Maalot said.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, declined for the first time in
four days, falling 0.1 percent to 281.99.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government debt of
similar maturity, rose four basis points to 214, implying an
average annual inflation rate of 2.14 percent.  The shekel weakened 0.3 percent to 3.7288 a dollar on Jan.
18, trimming its monthly gain to 0.1 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-year  interest-rate swaps , an
indicator of investor expectations for rates over the period,
declined one basis point to 1.72 percent that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
