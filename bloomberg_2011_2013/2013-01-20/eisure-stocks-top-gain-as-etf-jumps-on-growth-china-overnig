The largest exchange-traded  fund  of
Chinese equities jumped to a two-week high in the U.S. and the
nation’s leisure and travel companies gained after growth in the
Asian economy accelerated for the first time in two years.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI)  climbed 1.5 percent
in New York for its second weekly gain in 2013. Macau casino
operator  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  rose for a third week,
leading an advance in the  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the
most-traded Chinese shares in the U.S.  Home Inns & Hotels
Management Inc. (HMIN)  reached the highest price since March last week
while  China  Southern Airlines Co. surged to a one-year high.  The China-U.S. gauge and the benchmark for Chinese stocks
traded in Hong Kong posted weekly rallies for a second time this
year after government data showed December retail sales and
industrial production grew at the quickest pace in nine months.
The world’s second-largest economy expanded at a faster-than-
estimated 7.9 percent for the fourth quarter, up from a three-
year low of 7.4 percent in the previous period.  “The data confirmed improving  consumer confidence  we’ve
found in China in the last three months and most figures came
out a bit better than most people expected,” David Riedel, the
president of Riedel Research Group Inc. said in a phone
interview on Jan. 18 from San Francisco. “Consumption-related
stocks, including hotels and travel agencies should benefit and
we expect the government to roll out more measures to encourage
domestic consumption.”  Casino Estimates  The China-US Equity measure climbed 0.7 percent on Jan. 18
to 101.69, up 0.3 percent for the week, while the iShares China
ETF rose to $41.7, the highest since Jan. 2. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 index  added 0.9 percent last week to a five-year high
of 1,485.98 as U.S. House Republicans plan to vote this week on
a temporary increase in the debt-limit.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  surged to a five-
month high of 12,105.71 on Jan. 18, rising 2.2 percent for the
week while the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese
shares added 3.3 percent last week to 2,317.07, the steepest
advance in three weeks.  Melco Crown increased 5.6 percent last week to $19.74,
after reaching $19.92 the previous day which was the highest
level since February 2007.  Simon Cheung, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., raised a  price target  for Melco to $23.5 from $21.5
on Jan. 16, joining at least three other analysts last week in
lifting their estimates for the casino operator.  ‘Decidedly Better’  China Lodging Group Ltd. (HTHT) , a Shanghai-based budget hotel
operator, climbed 3.7 percent to $18.58 in its fourth straight
week of increases. Home Inns added 3.5 percent last week to
$31.13, reaching a 10-month high. Shanghai-based  Ctrip.com
International Ltd (CTRP) , China’s biggest online travel agency,
advanced 0.9 percent to $24.49, extending gains to a third week.  China’s total tourism income in 2012 is expected to rise
15.1 percent from 2011 to 2.59 trillion  yuan  ($420 billion),
according to a Jan. 10  report  on the website of China Tourism
Academy, a research agency supervised by the nation’s tourism
administration. The academy forecasts tourism sales will
increase 14.2 percent in 2013 to 2.96 trillion yuan.  “Sentiment is decidedly better than it was 12 weeks ago,
and it’s been kind of amazing actually,” Kevin Carter, chief
executive officer of Baochuan Capital Management LLC in Walnut
Creek,  California , said Jan. 18 by phone. “There’s a lot more
interest and a lot of inflows. In the last 10 weeks, it’s just
been a surge.”  Airline Traffic  China Eastern Airlines Corp. added 5 percent last week to
$23.56, the highest price since August. Its American depositary
receipts, each representing 50 underlying shares in the
Shanghai-based carrier, traded  higher than  its Hong Kong shares
for the first time in three days on Jan. 18.  China Southern
Airlines (ZNH) , Asia’s biggest carrier by passenger numbers, gained
2.6 percent last week to $28.83.  Chinese airline passenger traffic gained 11.8 percent in
December from a year earlier to 23.8 million, CAAC News, the
newspaper attached to China’s Civil Administration  reported  on
Jan. 17, citing preliminary statistics for 2012.  The Bloomberg Chinese Reverse Mergers Index (CHINARTO) , which tracks a
basket of companies that gained U.S. listings after buying firms
that already trade, advanced for a fourth week, rising 1.1
percent to 79.06 Jan. 18.  Vimicro Sales  Vimicro International Corp. (VIMC) , a Beijing-based audio and
video signal processing chipmaker, jumped 6.1 percent to a 13-
month high of $1.75, extending its gains this year to 43
percent. Its seven-day rally was the longest since September
2009.  The company targets a 30 percent growth in sales in 2013 as
it focuses on domestic sales of video surveillance systems,
Chief Executive Officer John Deng said in an interview at
Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York on Jan. 18.  Deng sees sales from the video monitoring systems rising to
50 percent of total revenue in one or two years, up from the
current 30 percent. The business will benefit from rising demand
for safety in Chinese cities as the nation seeks economic growth
from urbanization, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
