Sales of U.S. homes probably rose in
December to the highest level in three years as the industry
headed toward a more rooted recovery in 2013, economists said
before reports this week.  Combined purchases of new and existing properties climbed
to a 5.49 million annual rate last month, the highest level
since November 2009, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Another report may show the
outlook for growth brightened last month.  Historically low mortgage rates, an improving job market
and an increasing number of households will probably keep
spurring demand for housing this year. The rebound comes as
political wrangling in Washington over federal-spending cuts and
the debt begins to shake  consumer confidence , raising the risk
that the world’s largest economy will suffer.  “The housing market is coming back, gaining momentum, and
it’s one of the bright spots for the economy as we start 2013,”
said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Inc. in  Dallas .  Purchases of previously owned home climbed to a 5.1 million
annual rate in December, the strongest since November 2009,
economists  project  National Association of Realtors figures will
show Jan. 22. New-home sales picked up to a 385,000 annual rate
for the month, the best showing since April 2010, according to
the  survey  median ahead of a Jan. 24 Commerce Department report.  The combined reading would be the strongest since a
government tax credit for first-time buyers first expired three
years ago. It would be the second-highest since August 2007, four
months before the last recession began.  Dwindling Inventory  As a result of the pickup in demand, the inventory of homes
for sale has dwindled, driving up real-estate values and
encouraging more construction. There were 2.03 million existing
homes on the market in November, the  fewest  since December 2001,
and 151,000 new houses for sale, close to the 142,000 reached in
July that was the  lowest  since records began in 1963.  The most recent S&P/Case-Shiller index of homes in 20 cities
showed  prices  increased 4.3 percent in October from a year
earlier, the biggest gain since May 2010. The gauge is up almost
9 percent since reaching a 10-year low in March.  Builders broke ground on 954,000 new homes at an annual
rate in December, according to Commerce Department data released
Jan. 17. Last month’s starts capped the best year for the
industry since 2008, adding to signs residential real estate is
contributing to economic growth.  Record-low borrowing costs have underpinned the gains. The
average rate on a 30-year, fixed mortgage was 3.38 percent last
week,  hovering  near the 3.31 percent reached a month earlier
that was the lowest in data going back to 1972, according to
McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac.  2013 Outlook  Progress will probably build in 2013. Sales of existing
homes will rise about 7.2 percent to 4.98 million this year, the
highest since 2007, according to the median estimate of
economists and housing analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Prices
will gain 3.3 percent after an estimated 4.5 percent jump in
2012, according to the forecasters.  Builder shares are reflecting the recovery. The Standard &
Poor’s Supercomposite  Homebuilding Index (S15HOME)  advanced 101.4 percent
since the end of 2011, outpacing the 18.2 percent gain in the
broader S&P 500.  “After seven years of navigating an unprecedented market
downturn, we finally saw stabilization and recovery in 2012,”
Stuart Miller, chief executive officer of  Lennar Corp. (LEN) , the
largest U.S. homebuilder by market value, said during a Jan. 15
earnings call. “While there have been and still are economic
and political uncertainties ahead, we feel that this housing
recovery is fundamentally based and driven by a long-term
demographic need for housing. 2012, therefore, we believe is
just the beginning of the recovery.”  Also this week, the index of leading economic indicators, a
gauge of the outlook for the next three to six months, will probably
show the expansion will overcome the rancor of the fiscal talks
in  Washington . The median estimate of those surveyed project the
New York-based Conference Board’s measure climbed 0.4 percent
last month after declining 0.2 percent in November.
