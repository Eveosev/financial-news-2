Firefighters in  Australia , which is
emerging from last week’s record heat wave, are using cooler
temperatures to contain wildfires that destroyed property and
claimed lives.  Temperatures in Sydney, Australia’s largest city, which
reached a record on Jan. 18 of 45.8 degrees Celsius (114.4
degrees Fahrenheit), are forecast to reach 25 degrees today,
with Melbourne hitting 26 degrees. More than 120 blazes are
still burning in New South  Wales  and Victoria, the nation’s most
populous states, according to  emergency services .  “We’re not out of the woods yet,” Kim Payne, spokeswoman
for Victoria’s State Control Centre, said in a phone interview
from Melbourne today. “We’re using the current cooler, more
stable conditions to work really hard to get the fires contained
before temperatures peak again later in the week.”  Melbourne  is forecast to rise to 35 degrees on Jan. 24,
while the national capital, Canberra, which posted its second-
highest temperature on Jan. 18 of 41.6 degrees Celsius, will
reach 34 degrees on Jan. 22. Sydney is forecast to register 30
degrees on Jan. 22.  Australia’s hot, dry climate makes bushfires a major risk
in the southern hemisphere’s summer, a situation exacerbated
this month by a consistent heat wave. The continent registered a
national average of 40.33 degrees Celsius on Jan. 7, the hottest
day in more than 100 years of records.  More than 150 homes have been destroyed by fire throughout
the nation’s southeast this month. An 80-year-old man was killed
last week by a blaze in the Victoria town of Seaton, while a
firefighter died earlier this month in the island state of
Tasmania, where about a 100 homes have been destroyed.  The fires have created a thick smoke haze above Melbourne,
which is hosting the Australian Open tennis tournament. The haze
has been seen in  New Zealand , about 1,450 kilometers (900 miles)
east of Australia,  United Press International  reported
yesterday, citing MetService meteorologists.  The worst fires in Australia’s history, the so-called Black
Saturday blazes, killed 173 people as they swept through rural
Victoria in February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
