Leicester beat Toulouse 9-5 to win
Pool 2 and reach the knockout phase of European rugby’s Heineken
Cup after today’s final round of group games.  Toby Flood got all the home team’s points with three
penalties on a snow-swept surface. Yoann Huget scored a try for
four-time champion Toulouse, which is now out of this year’s
competition. Flood was sin-binned late in the game but his team
held on to win.  Also today, Saracens confirmed its top spot in Pool 1 with
a 40-7 win over Edinburgh, and second-placed Munster beat Racing
Metro 29-6. Munster’s win meant Leinster, tournament winner the
past two years, failed to progress to the quarterfinals as it
didn’t secure one of the two spots for best runners-up in the
groups.  Leicester, Saracens, Harlequins, Ulster, Clermont Auvergne
and Toulon advance as group winners, while Munster and
Montpellier went through as the best second-placed teams.  Also this weekend, there were wins for Harlequins,
Connacht, Ulster, Glasgow, Leinster, Clermont-Auvergne, Cardiff,
Montpellier and Treviso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
