Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez will soon
enter a new stage in his recovery from a fourth cancer operation
in Cuba, Vice President  Nicolas Maduro  said, without providing
further details.  Maduro says he last saw Chavez Jan. 14 during a visit to
the Venezuelan president’s bedside in Cuba.  “He is stabilizing in all his medical indicators, in the
function of his organs, in all his fundamental vital indicators
and is fully conscious,” Maduro said today in an interview on
the Televen television network. “He is gaining vital strength
to begin a second stage of recovery that will be announced
through official reports.”  Chavez, who suffered breathing difficulties from a lung
infection and bleeding following the operation five weeks ago,
is sending Maduro “permanent instructions” as his deputy fills
in during the recovery, he said. In their last face-to-face
meeting, Chavez gave Maduro permission to deliver the
presidency’s annual report to the National Assembly and they
spoke about  oil prices , the budget and social programs, Maduro
said.  Venezuela’s 58-year-old leader has been battling a lung
infection following the operation that prevented him from
attending his own swearing-in ceremony Jan. 10 and hasn’t been
seen or heard from since the surgery in Havana Dec. 11.  The  Supreme Court  endorsed delaying the inauguration,
leaving Maduro, Chavez’s handpicked successor, to run affairs in
 South America ’s biggest oil exporter. The opposition has called
the move a violation of the constitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
