Suspected terrorists fired at a
convoy of soldiers yesterday in the Nigerian central state of
Kogi on their way to join the West African Force in  Mali ,
leaving two dead, military authorities said.  “The terrorists laid ambush for the soldiers on their way
to Mali and fired gunshots and explosives that killed two of our
men,” Bola Koleoso, a spokesman for the military, said today by
telephone from Kogi. Four soldiers were wounded and were taken
to hospital while the rest continued the journey, Koleoso said.  Nigeria  increased its contribution to the force in the
desert north of Mali to 1,200 because the crisis may spill over
into Nigeria if not brought under control, President  Goodluck Jonathan  told lawmakers Jan. 17.  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous nation is
battling an insurgency by Boko Haram that has killed hundreds of
people since 2009. The Islamist group has claimed responsibility
for bomb and gun attacks in the mainly Muslim north and in
Abuja, the Nigerian capital.  To contact the reporters on this story:
