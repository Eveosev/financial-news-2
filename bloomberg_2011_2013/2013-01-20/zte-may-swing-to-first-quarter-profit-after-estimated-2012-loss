ZTE Corp. (000063) ,  China ’s second-biggest
mobile-phone equipment maker, said it may swing to a profit in
the first quarter after posting an estimated loss last year.  The company plans to control costs, streamline its
organization and focus its efforts in developed markets such as
the U.S.,  Europe  and  Japan , ZTE said in a statement to the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange today, without giving a target for net
income in the first three months of 2013. ZTE intends to grab as
much as 10 percent of the U.S. handset market by 2015, Cheng
Lixin, head of ZTE’s operations, said in a Jan. 10 interview.  “The smartphone industry will continue to blossom and
there is huge room for growth in the enterprise networking
market,” ZTE said in the statement.  The company estimated a net loss of between 2.5 billion
 yuan  and 2.9 billion yuan ($402 million-$466 million) in 2012,
citing delays in domestic and international network projects and
a drop in revenue for terminal products. That compares with net
income of 2.06 billion yuan in 2011. ZTE, which posted a third-
quarter loss of 1.9 billion yuan, is scheduled to report fourth-
quarter and full-year earnings on March 28.  ZTE’s Hong Kong-listed stock tumbled 39 percent over the
past year, compared with a 20 percent gain for the city’s Hang
Seng Index. The Shenzhen-traded shares have fallen 39 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
