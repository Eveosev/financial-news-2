China  expresses “strong
discontent” with comments made by U.S. Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton  over the Diaoyu islands, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement on the ministry’s website
today.  China expresses “firm opposition” to remarks Clinton made
after meeting Japan’s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, Qin said,
referring to her comments that the U.S. doesn’t hold any
position on the sovereignty of the islands.  “We urge the U.S. side to adopt a responsible attitude
with regard to the issue of the Diaoyu islands,” Qin said.  Clinton met Kishida in Washington last week.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
