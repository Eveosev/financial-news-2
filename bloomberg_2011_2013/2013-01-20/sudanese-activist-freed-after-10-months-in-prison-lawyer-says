Jalila Khamis Koko, who was held for
providing aid to civilians affected by fighting between
government forces and rebels in  Sudan , was released from prison
by a court in Khartoum, her lawyer said today.  The schoolteacher and member of the Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement-North rebel group was charged with five
criminal counts on Dec. 13, including “waging war against the
state.” She spent 10 months in prison after being arrested on
March 15 by National Security Services.  Khamis Koko was found guilty of one charge of “publishing
information likely to cause disturbances,” with the court
deducting the prison sentence from time already served, her
lawyer, Nabil Adib Abdalla, said by telephone. Several other
charges were dropped last week when witnesses failed to provide
adequate evidence,  Amnesty International  said on Jan. 15.  Fighting between government forces and rebels in Southern
Kordofan broke out in June 2011 and spread to Blue Nile state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
