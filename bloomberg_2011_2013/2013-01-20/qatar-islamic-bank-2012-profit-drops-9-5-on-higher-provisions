Qatar Islamic Bank (QIBK)  posted a 9.5
percent decline in profit last year as the country’s biggest
Shariah-compliant lender by assets raised provisions against bad
loans.  Net income was 1.24 billion riyals ($341 million), the
Doha-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today. That
compared with profit of 1.37 billion riyals in 2011. The mean
estimate of seven analysts was for profit of 1.46 billion
riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The bank raised provisions to 502 million riyals in 2012,
from 194 million riyals in 2011, it said.  “Going forward, we can assume similar or low provisions,
given that they already booked them,” Abdullah Amin, an equity
analyst at Qatar National Bank Financial Services, said in a
phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
