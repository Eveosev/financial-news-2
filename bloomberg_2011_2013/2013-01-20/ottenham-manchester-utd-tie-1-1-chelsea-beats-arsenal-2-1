Clint Dempsey  scored in injury time
as Tottenham tied 1-1 against Manchester United in English
soccer’s Premier League today, while Chelsea defeated Arsenal
2-1.  Robin van Persie had given United a first-half lead at
White Hart Lane in a match played in snowy conditions in north
London.    There was also wintry weather at Stamford Bridge, where the
Blues took an early two-goal lead through Juan Mata and Frank
Lampard. Theo Walcott, who has just signed a new “long-term”
contract, replied for Arsenal in the second half.  United has 56 points, Manchester City is on 51, with
Chelsea six points further back. Tottenham has 41, Everton 37,
with Arsenal among three teams on 34 points.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
