Hedge funds  raised bullish commodity
wagers by the most since November as a jump in U.S. housing
starts and the first acceleration in Chinese growth since 2010
drove prices to a three-month high.  Speculators increased net-long  positions  across 18 futures
and options by 4.3 percent to 682,521 contracts in the week
ended Jan. 15, the biggest gain since Nov. 27, U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show. Wagers on a soybean rally
rose for the first time in four weeks on signs of improved
demand for supplies from the U.S., the biggest exporter. Gold
holdings rebounded from the lowest since August.  U.S.  housing starts  jumped 12 percent to a four-year high
in December, capping the best year for the industry since 2008,
the Commerce Department said Jan 17.  China  expanded a faster-
than-expected 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter, government data
showed the next day. Investors boosted commodity holdings by
$20.4 billion last year, up from $14.6 billion in 2011, Barclays
Plc estimates.  “The stabilizing housing sector adds to commodity demand,
especially building materials,” said  Mihir Worah , who manages
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Commodity Real Return
Strategy Fund, with about $22 billion of assets. “Better growth
in China is impacting copper and other base metals. We’re seeing
increased investor flows into commodities, so supportive
fundamentals along with increased investor flows are resulting
in higher prices.”  Commodity Gains  The S&P GSCI climbed 1.7 percent last week and reached
661.02 on Jan. 18, the highest since Oct. 19. The MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities rose 0.5 percent, and the dollar
added 0.6 percent against a basket of six major trading
partners. A Bank of America Corp. index shows Treasuries
returned 0.1 percent. Gold, up 0.3 percent today, and silver,
0.5 percent higher, extended weekly gains.  Housing starts in the U.S. climbed last month to a 954,000
annual rate, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. U.S.  jobless claims  decreased by 37,000 to 335,000
in the week through Jan. 12, the lowest since Jan. 19, 2008,
according to the Labor Department.  China’s acceleration snapped a seven-quarter slowdown as
government efforts drove a rebound in retail sales and the
housing market.  Industrial output  in December rose a more-than-
expected 10 percent and fixed-asset investment for the year
gained 21 percent. Growth may quicken to 8 percent this quarter
and 8.2 percent in the three months ended June 30, according to
the median of 36 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher Taxes  Higher taxes for Americans may dim the outlook for
commodity prices if  consumer spending  slows, said Adrian Day,
who manages about $170 million of assets as the president of
Adrian Day Asset Management in Annapolis,  Maryland .  As part of its budget agreement on Jan. 1, Congress agreed
to let the  payroll tax , used to pay for Social Security
benefits, return to its 2010 level of 6.2 percent from 4.2
percent. That reduces the paycheck by about $83 a month for
someone who earns $50,000. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary  index  of consumer sentiment dropped to 71.3
in January, the lowest since December 2011, data showed Jan. 18.  “When people got their first paycheck this year, everybody
was talking about it, and it’s really something they noticed,”
Day said. “That is going to have a lot of impact. We may see
people substituting buying bulk items instead of branded items
and going to Wal-Mart instead of Whole Foods. It can all hurt
the economy because it’s a significant amount of money out of
people’s paychecks.”  $861 Million  Money managers added a net $861 million to commodity funds
in the week ended Jan. 16, according to  Cameron Brandt , the
director of research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR
Global, which tracks money flows. Outflows from precious-metals
funds totaled $39 million, he said.  Wagers on a crude-oil rally gained 6.7 percent to 179,249
contracts, the highest since September, CFTC data show. Futures
have climbed for six consecutive weeks in  New York , the longest
rally since November 2011.  China, the largest oil-consuming country after the U.S.,
accounted for 11 percent of global demand in 2011, according to
BP Plc. The nation, with a population of 1.34 billion, uses
about 40 percent of the world’s copper, Barclays estimates.  Net-long positions in gold rose 8 percent to 99,458
contracts, the biggest gain since Nov. 27. Those for silver
climbed 6.6 percent to 22,397, the first advance in seven weeks,
and palladium wagers increased 9.2 percent to 16,627.  Palladium Outlook  Palladium will be the best performer in 2013 among precious
metals as supplies tighten and demand increases from China,
Barclays analysts led by  Suki Cooper  in New York, said in a
report Jan. 17. Energy and industrial metals also will rise this
year, according to Barclays.  A  measure  of net-longs for 11 U.S. farm goods advanced 4
percent to 341,527 contracts, the first increase in six weeks,
the CFTC data show. The S&P GSCI Agriculture Index of eight
commodities jumped 2.8 percent last week, the most since July.  Soybean holdings climbed 8.4 percent to 79,436 contracts,
the biggest gain since Dec. 11. Futures in  Chicago  reached a
four-week high on Jan. 17 after the U.S. reported the biggest
jump in export sales in more than two years.  Sales in the week ended Jan. 10 jumped to 1.61 million
metric tons, the most since October 2010 and up from 321,800 a
week earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said. The
purchases included 845,600 by China, the top consumer.  “The outlook for world economic growth has improved,”
said  John Kinsey , who helps manage about C$1 billion (US$1.01
billion) of assets at Caldwell Securities Ltd. in Toronto.
“China’s such a big factor because they’re the largest importer
of almost any commodity. There’s a new regime in  Japan , and
 Europe  seems to have its act together. Global economies are
looking better than they have in some time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
