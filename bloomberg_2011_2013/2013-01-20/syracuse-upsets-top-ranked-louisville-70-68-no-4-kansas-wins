Michael Carter-Williams completed a
dunk and free throw for three points in the final 25 seconds as
No. 6  Syracuse University  upset top-ranked University of
Louisville 70-68 in college basketball.  In another Top 5 game yesterday, fourth-ranked  Kansas 
(16-1) topped Texas 64-59 to remain undefeated after four games
in the Big 12 Conference. The Longhorns (8-9) are winless in
four conference games.  The Orange from Syracuse (17-1) are undefeated in the  Big
East  after five games, while the Cardinals (16-2) were given
their first conference loss.  Syracuse took a 38-38 tie into the locker room after
Carter-Williams sunk a three-pointer with nine seconds left in
the half at KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. The sophomore guard
ended the game with 16 points after accounting for his team’s
final 13 points, scoring 11 and assisting on two.  “The second half, I tried to fight back the best I
could,” Carter-Williams told reporters. “I had two or three
turnovers but I just kept flipping the page, flipping the page
and ended up winning the game, which was great. Those free
throws, I just had to have faith in myself and just try to do
anything to get the win.”  Brandon Triche scored a team-high 23 points for Syracuse.  Russ Smith scored a game-high 25 points for the Cardinals,
who were the second straight No. 1 team to lose. Duke lost to
North Carolina State 84-76 on Jan. 12.  At Frank Erwin Special Events Center in Austin,  Texas , Ben
McLemore scored 16 points and Jeff Withey added 14 as the
Jayhawks rallied from a two-point halftime deficit.  “We just had to play through it,” McLemore said of the
slow start. “We talked in the huddle. Coach told us to be more
aggressive, and that’s what we did.”  Sheldon McClellan came off the bench to score 18 points for
the Longhorns with Julien Lewis contributing 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
