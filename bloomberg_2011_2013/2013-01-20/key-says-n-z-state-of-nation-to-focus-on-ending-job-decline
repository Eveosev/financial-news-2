New Zealand Prime Minister John Key,
trying to reverse two straight quarters of falling employment,
will present an agenda focused on job growth when he delivers a
state-of-the-nation speech this week.  “We get it that jobs are important, that economic growth
is important,” Key told Television New Zealand’s  Breakfast 
today. New Zealanders want to be able to look after their
families “and critical to that is having employment, so we are
going to have a sense of urgency about some of the things that
we’re doing,” he said.  Key said his speech on Jan. 25 will lay out plans to speed
economic growth, which slowed to 2 percent in the 12 months
through September. The government is betting that rebuilding in
earthquake-damaged Christchurch will generate demand and jobs
after the  unemployment  rate rose to a 13-year high of 7.3
percent in the third quarter.  “For us, 2013 is a big year with the economy at front and
center stage again, along with Christchurch,” he said. “The
government is going to move and act this year to ensure that New
Zealanders have confidence that they are going to have
employment.”  Key tomorrow will announce a change in his cabinet, sparked
by the need to appoint a new parliament speaker.  Primary Industries Minister David Carter is expected to be
named as new speaker, and former environment minister Nick Smith
may be reappointed to the cabinet, according to TVNZ.  “They’re pretty well-educated guesses,” Key said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
