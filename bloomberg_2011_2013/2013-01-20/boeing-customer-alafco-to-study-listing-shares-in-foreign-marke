Aviation Lease & Finance Co. (ALAFCO) , a
customer of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co., said it may list part of
the company’s shares in a foreign market.  Alafco, as the Kuwait-based company is known, received
shareholders’ approval on Jan. 17 to conduct a feasibility
study, it said in a statement to the local stock exchange today.
The company didn’t provide further details.  Alafco’s  shares , which are traded on the Kuwait stock
exchange, closed unchanged at 355 fils today.  Kuwait Finance
House (KFIN) , the country’s biggest Islamic lender, is the largest
shareholder in Alafco with a stake of 53.7 percent,  according to
data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Alafco, which posted a full-year profit of 25.6 million
dinars ($91 million), agreed to buy 20 Boeing 737 Max aircraft
valued at $1.9 billion at current list prices, Boeing said in
July. Airbus said in February it won an order for 35 A320neo
planes from Alafco, raising the company’s backlog to 85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
