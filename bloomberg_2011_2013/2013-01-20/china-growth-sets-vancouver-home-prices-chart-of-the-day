Vancouver’s housing market may
depend on the strength of China’s economy as much as anything
that happens in Canada.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the relationship between growth
in China’s gross domestic product and home prices in
metropolitan Vancouver, Canada’s most expensive city, where
Statistics Canada data show 15 percent of the population has a
first language that’s a Chinese dialect.  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney has warned that
indebted domestic consumers are a risk to the world’s 11th
largest economy, and Finance Minister Jim Flaherty tightened
mortgage lending rules for a fourth time last year. Vancouver
house prices have risen as much as 73 percent since mid-2005,
pushing the average cost of a single detached home in the city
over C$1 million ($1.01 million).  The most recent Chinese data signal Vancouver may get fresh
support from across the Pacific Ocean. Annual growth in Asia’s
largest economy was 7.9 percent in the fourth quarter, up from
7.4 percent in the prior quarter, marking the first acceleration
in two years, the National Bureau of Statistics said Jan. 18 in
Beijing.  Faster growth “would support a slightly stronger Vancouver
housing market,” said Robin Wiebe, senior economist at the
Conference Board of Canada in Ottawa and formerly an analyst at
Canada’s federal housing agency. “The major wild card right now
is the ongoing impact of the tighter mortgage rules.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
