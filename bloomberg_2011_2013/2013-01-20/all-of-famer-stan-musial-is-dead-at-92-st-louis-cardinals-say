Stan Musial, the  St. Louis  Cardinals
baseball star whose consistent hitting for both average and
power earned him the nickname “Stan the Man” and the affection
of an entire city, has died, the team said. He was 92.  Musial died today surrounded by family at his home in
Ladue,  Missouri , not far from St. Louis, where he made his mark
in the 1940s and ’50s.  In a 22-year career, all as a Cardinal, Musial won seven
National League batting titles and three Most Valuable Player
awards. His tightly coiled left-handed swing was emulated by a
generation of fans.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
