Hermes International SCA Chief
Executive Officer  Patrick Thomas  said the company had a
“fantastic” end to 2012, echoing rival Salvatore Ferragamo SpA
and suggesting demand for luxury leather goods remains strong.  Last year was “very good,” Thomas said late yesterday
before the Paris-based company men’s fashion show in the French
capital. Thomas also said that he will retire in January 2014.  Hermes, whose Birkin handbags sell for prices starting at
about 5,500 euros ($7,300), raised its target for 2012 revenue
growth to more than 13 percent because of surging demand in
Asia. Ferragamo CEO Michele Norsa said Jan. 13 that he was
“positive” for 2013 after sales at the Florence, Italy-based
shoemaker showed a “positive trend” in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
