The  San Francisco 49ers  completed
the biggest comeback in a National Football Conference
championship game to beat the Atlanta Falcons 28-24 and advance
to the Super Bowl for the first time in 18 years.  The 49ers, who trailed 17-0 in the first half, will play
the  New England Patriots  or the  Baltimore Ravens  in the National
Football League title game on Feb. 3 in  New Orleans .  The previous biggest comeback to win in the NFC title game
was by the Falcons, who recovered from a 13-point deficit to
beat the Minnesota Vikings 30-27 on Jan. 17, 1999.  “We fought all game long. It wasn’t easy by any means,”
49ers linebacker Patrick Willis, who had 12 tackles, said in a
televised interview. “The past two years, all we’ve done is
play as a team.”  San Francisco  last reached the  Super Bowl  after the 1994
season, when it beat the San Diego Chargers 49-26. The 49ers,
who were beaten by the  New York  Giants in last year’s NFC
championship game, have never lost in five prior trips to the
Super Bowl.  The win at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta was San Francisco’s
first in six road games in the playoffs going back to 1989. It’s
only the third time the team has won away from home in the
postseason.  San Francisco snapped a four-game losing streak against the
Falcons and is now tied at 1-1 in playoff meetings with Atlanta.  The Falcons opened a 17-0 lead one play into the second
quarter as Julio Jones hauled in touchdown passes of 46 yards
and 20 yards from quarterback  Matt Ryan  either side of a 35-yard
field goal by Matt Bryant.  San Francisco made it a three-point game as Lamichael James
drove through the Atlanta defense on a 15-yard scoring run and
 Vernon Davis  caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback
Colin Kaepernick with two minutes to play in the first half.  Gonzalez Scores  Ryan then capped a seven-play, 85-yard drive with a 10-yard
pass to Tony Gonzalez 25 seconds before halftime to push
Atlanta’s lead to 24-14. Gonzalez, 36, is sixth all-time in the
NFL with 103 regular-season touchdown receptions.  Atlanta finished the first half with 297 yards of offense
to 166 yards for San Francisco.  The 49ers made it three touchdowns in as many possessions
as  Frank Gore  rounded out the opening drive of the second half
with a 5-yard run.  Trailing 24-21, San Francisco then missed two opportunities
to score.  First,  David Akers , who failed with a league-high 13 field-
goal attempts during the regular season, missed from 38 yards as
his kick struck the top of the left upright and caromed wide.  The 49ers got the ball back when Ryan fumbled a snap on the
next drive. Kaepernick drove his team to Atlanta’s 5-yard line
before  Michael Crabtree  fumbled as he was tackled at the 1-yard
line at the start of the fourth quarter.  49ers Lead  After Atlanta punted, San Francisco went ahead for the
first time as Gore ran for his second score, from nine yards, to
make it 28-24 with 8:23 remaining.  Atlanta then drove 60 yards on 13 plays before Ryan threw
an incomplete pass on a 4th-and-4 at San Francisco’s 10-yard
line with 1:09 remaining. The Falcons could only get one play
off after regaining possession with six seconds remaining.  The second-seeded Patriots today host the Ravens, ranked
fourth in the American Football Conference, for the right to
face the 49ers.  New England  is 4-0 at home in the AFC
championship game.  It’s the first time in 25 years that the same teams have
played for the AFC title in consecutive seasons.  The Patriots won 23-20 last season after Ravens kicker
 Billy Cundiff  missed a 32-yard field goal attempt with 11
seconds to play. Baltimore in August released Cundiff in favor
of rookie Justin Tucker, who kicked a field goal to give the
Ravens a 31-30 win over New England a month later.  Gronkowski Injured  The Patriots will be without  Rob Gronkowski , who fractured
his forearm in a 41-28 win over the Houston Texans a week ago.
Gronkowski tied for fourth place in the NFL with 11 touchdown
receptions during the regular season.  Quarterback  Tom Brady  led the Patriots to Super Bowl wins
after the 2001, 2003 and 2004 seasons, twice earning the game’s
Most Valuable Player award. New England also lost in the Super
Bowl last year and after the 2006 season.  Baltimore won in its only visit to the championship round,
after the 2000 season.  The last teams to vie for the AFC title in consecutive
years were the Broncos and Cleveland Browns following the 1986
and 1987 seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
