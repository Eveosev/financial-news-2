Wise Dan, winner of the Breeders’
Cup Mile last year, won 2012 Horse of the Year honors at the
42nd annual Eclipse Awards.  Wise Dan became the first horse since John Henry in 1981 to
win the top award in addition to the titles of champion male
turf horse and champion older male, at the ceremonies last night
at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach,  Florida .  The 5-year-old chestnut gelding, trained by Charlie
Lopresti and owned by Morton Fink of Northbrook,  Illinois , won
five of six starts last year.  Wise Dan received 194 votes, followed by Kentucky Derby and
Preakness winner I’ll Have Another (30 votes), and Fort Larned
(12), winner of the $5 million Breeders’ Cup Classic.  Ramon Dominquez, who was hospitalized with a skull fracture
after being thrown from his mount two days ago at Aqueduct
Racetrack, was named jockey of the year. Dominquez set a record
for purse earnings by a rider in a single year on Nov.9. His
mounts earned $25.6 million to surpass the $23.4 million mark
set by Jerry Bailey in 2003.  Trainer Dale Romans, who had winners in the Woodford
Reserve, Arlington Million and Breeders’ Cup Turf, bested Todd Pletcher and Bob Baffert in the voting for trainer of the year.  The Eclipse Awards are given to thoroughbred horses and
individuals whose outstanding achievements have earned them the
title of champion in their respective divisions. Votes are cast
by representatives of the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association, Daily Racing Form and National Turf Writers And
Broadcasters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
