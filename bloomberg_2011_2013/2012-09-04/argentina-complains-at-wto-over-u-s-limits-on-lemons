Argentina  complained at the  World
Trade Organization  over U.S. measures it says restrict imports
of fresh lemons from the northwestern region of the Latin
American country.  Argentina said the prohibition of lemon imports for the
last 11 years lacks scientific justification and violates trade
rules, the Geneva-based WTO said in an e-mailed statement.  Yesterdayâ€™s request for consultations came four days after
Argentina complained about U.S. limits on imports of Argentine
beef and other meat products. Such a request is the first step
in WTO dispute proceedings and means the governments must hold
talks for at least two months in a bid to resolve the matter. If
the discussions fail, Argentina can ask WTO judges to rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
