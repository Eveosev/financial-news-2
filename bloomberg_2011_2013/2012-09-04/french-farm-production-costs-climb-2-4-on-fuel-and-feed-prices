French farm-production costs rose
2.4 percent in July as growers and livestock breeders paid more
for energy and fuel, feed and fertilizer, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said.  An index of agricultural-input costs averaged 132.4 for the
month, against 129.4 a year earlier, the ministry  reported  today
on its website.  Energy and lubricant expenses, making up about 11 percent
of the gauge, jumped 3.3 percent, according to the report. The
cost of  animal feed , with an index weighting of about 25
percent, climbed 2.7 percent.  “The price of animal feed continues to progress since
February,” the ministry wrote. “Those for energy and
lubricants again head up, after having declined during the
second quarter.”  The index for fertilizer, accounting for 12 percent of
farming costs, rose 2.9 percent and expenses for seeds and
planting material advanced 3.5 percent, the report showed.  Production costs for commodity crops, a subgroup of farming
expenses, gained 3.7 percent, while livestock and dairy
producers’ costs rose 2.5 percent, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
