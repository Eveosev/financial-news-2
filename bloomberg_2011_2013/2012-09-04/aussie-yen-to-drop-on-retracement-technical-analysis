The Australian dollar may be set for
further declines against the yen as it tests a support area
defined by a so-called Fibonacci retracement level, UBS AG said.  The Aussie, as the currency is also known, has been testing
80.10 yen, the 38 percent Fibonacci retracement of its advance
from a low of 74.48 on June 1 to a high of 83.58 on Aug. 21,
 Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy in
 London , wrote in an e-mailed note to clients yesterday. The
currency may head toward 79.54 yen to 79.03 yen, Adcock wrote.
The 79.54 figure was the lowest level in July, while 79.03 is
the Aussie’s 50 percent retracement level last seen on June 18,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Australian dollar-yen cross “has been under selling
pressure,” Adcock wrote. “With the recent weakness seeing
daily and weekly trending tools turn negative, the picture is
bearish.”  Australia ’s currency was little changed at 80.19 yen at
11:27 a.m. in Sydney from 80.18 yesterday, when it touched
80.07, the lowest since July 25. The Aussie has declined 1.8
percent since June 29 versus its Japanese counterpart, heading
for its back-to-back quarterly losses since 2008.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break below support, as levels where there may be orders to buy
are known, indicates it may decline to the next level.
