The naira fell for a third day
against the dollar on the Nigerian  interbank market  as import
demand increased.  The currency of Africa’s biggest crude producer fell 0.2
percent to 158.5 a dollar as of 2:26 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has advanced 2.4 percent this
year, the best performer in Africa according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “There was some late demand,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging
markets strategist in London at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said
in an e-mailed reply to questions today. The currency earlier
rallied on speculation that  oil companies  were going to sell
dollars in the market, Gadio said.  Fuel imports have been a source of pressure on the naira,
according to the Central Bank of Nigeria, with the country
relying on imports to meet more than 70 percent of domestic fuel
needs because of a lack of refining capacity.  The yield on Nigeria’s 7 percent domestic bonds due October
2019 dropped 29 basis points to 13.52 percent, according to
yesterday’s data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association
website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 slid seven basis points to 4.89 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi was down 0.1 percent to 1.9355 a dollar in
Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
