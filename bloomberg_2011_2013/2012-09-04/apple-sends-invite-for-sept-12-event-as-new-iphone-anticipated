Apple Inc. (AAPL)  sent out invitations to a
Sept. 12 product event in  San Francisco , where the company is
expected to unveil a redesigned iPhone.  “It’s almost here,” Cupertino, California-based Apple
said in the invitation, whose image includes a ‘5’ in shadow,
possibly in reference to the new product’s name. At the event,
set for 10 a.m. at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Apple will
introduce a new iPhone with a larger screen and thinner body,
two people with knowledge of the plans said in July.  The iPhone is Apple’s top-selling product, accounting for
about 70 percent of its profits, according to Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. Release of the new model, which will work with
speedier wireless networks, comes as Apple faces heightened
competition from  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which has become the
world’s largest handset maker by releasing dozens of new devices
a year, compared with Apple’s single new iPhone release.  If the device goes on sale on Sept. 21, Apple could sell as
many as 10 million new iPhones in the final week of September,
according to  Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos.  The success of the iPhone has helped Apple become the
world’s most valuable company by market value. The company’s
shares rose 1.5 percent to $674.97 at the close in New York. The
shares have risen more than sevenfold since Apple co-founder
 Steve Jobs  introduced the device in January 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
