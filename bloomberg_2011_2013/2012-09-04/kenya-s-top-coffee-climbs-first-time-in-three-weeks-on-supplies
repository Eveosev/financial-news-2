Kenya ’s top coffee rose for the
first time in three weeks after supplies of the grade declined,
the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  Benchmark AA gained as much as 17 percent to $312 per 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bag from $267 a week ago, the exchange said
today in an e-mailed statement from Nairobi, the capital.
Supplies of the grade fell 32 percent to 812 bags, and the
average price climbed 7 percent to $281.27 a bag,  “The supply for AA was low and yet there were some orders
for it,” Mansukh Shah, a coffee trader at Nairobi-based
Alanwood Ltd., said by phone. “On the whole the quality of the
coffee was mixed with little changes in prices of other
grades.”  Sales at the auction climbed to 8,148 bags valued at $1.6
million from 5,717 bags worth $1.1 million last week, according
to the exchange. Supplies at the auction fell 6 percent to
20,714 bags. The average price for all the coffee sold rose 2
percent to $160.16.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
