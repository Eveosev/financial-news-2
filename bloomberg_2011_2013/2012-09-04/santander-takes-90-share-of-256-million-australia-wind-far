Banco Santander SA (SAN)  plans to take a
90 percent equity share in a A$250 million ($256 million) wind
farm developed by  CBD Energy (CBD)  Ltd. in New South Wales,  Australia .  CBD Energy will hold the remaining 10 percent in the
Taralga project, which will produce enough electricity to power
40,000 homes a year, the Sydney-based renewable energy developer
said today in a statement. Taralga is Madrid-based Santander’s
first Australian wind farm, according to CBD.  The project partners are “well advanced” in raising debt
for the 106.8-megawatt venture, which has investment costs of
about A$250 million. The project is completing arrangements with
a preferred wind turbine supplier, according to the statement.  TRUenergy Holdings Pty Ltd., the Melbourne-based
electricity company, agreed to buy all the power produced by the
facility.  CBD said in a statement yesterday that the power purchase
agreement with TRUenergy will deliver about A$300 million of
“off-take value” to the project. Taralga, with development
approval for 51 turbines, is expected to be completed in 2014,
according to CBD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
