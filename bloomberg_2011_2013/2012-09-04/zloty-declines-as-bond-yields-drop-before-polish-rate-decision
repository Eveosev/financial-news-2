The zloty slid for a second day
while yields on Poland’s five-year notes dropped to a record on
speculation the central bank will signal tomorrow it plans to
cut  interest rates .  The zloty depreciated 0.2 percent to 4.1963 per euro as of
5:15 p.m. in Warsaw, the third-steepest slide among more than 20
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The yield on
five-year bonds fell six basis points to 4.24 percent, a record
low, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Traders in interest rate derivatives are betting that
policy makers are going to cut rates by the end of the year
after leaving them unchanged tomorrow. The bank has scope to
reduce borrowing costs if needed as the country’s economy slows,
Governor  Marek Belka  told Bloomberg Television during a weekend
conference of central bankers and economists in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming.  The policy makers should signal a “readiness to cut in the
fourth quarter,”  Rafal Benecki , an economist at ING Groep NV in
Warsaw, said in an e-mailed note to clients.  Benecki is among 26 of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
that predict the main rate will stay at 4.75 percent tomorrow.
Three month forward-rate agreements are trading 47 basis points
below the Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
