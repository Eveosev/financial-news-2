Chinese  stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to the lowest level since February 2009, as
Societe Generale SA predicted a weaker growth outlook and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its estimates for Chinese earnings.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  sank the most in ten weeks as
Credit Suisse Group AG warned of softening loan demand and lower
net interest margins at lenders.  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) ,  China ’s
biggest producer of baijiu liquor by market value, surged the
most in almost two years after saying it will raise some product
prices. Citic Securities Co. rose to a one-week high on plans to
buy a 30 percent stake in Shenzhen Qianhai Equity Exchange.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  closed 0.8 percent lower at
2,043.65, the lowest level since Feb. 2, 2009, even after
commentary in the China Securities Journal outlined possible new
government stimulus measures. About four stocks fell for each
one that rose. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost 1.1 percent to 2,204.41.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  retreated 0.8 percent.  “There’s not many bright spots in the stock market now,”
Zhang Yanbin, an analyst with Zheshang Securities Co. in
 Shanghai , said by phone today. “The weak economy continues to
weigh on investors’ minds. We need more policy loosening for the
market to pick up.”  Signs that China’s economic slowdown is deepening have
dragged the Shanghai Composite down 8.2 percent this quarter.
The gauge sank 2.7 percent in August, a fourth straight month of
declines. That’s the  longest streak  since the five months
through August 2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  New Stimulus  China’s efforts to stabilize economic growth may rely on
exports and domestic consumption, according to a front-page
commentary in China Securities Journal today. New stimulus may
include raising export tax rebates, subsidizing purchases of
goods and fine-tuning monetary policy in the fourth quarter,
according to the commentary. Over-reliance on investment as a
way to boost the economy should be “corrected,” according to
the commentary, written by a reporter at the newspaper named
Zhang Zhaohui.  While China will avoid a full-blown hard landing, a shift
to a new consumer-led growth model will see structurally weaker
growth outlook, according to a report from  Societe Generale . The
brokerage lowered its forecast for China’s real gross domestic
growth to 7.7 percent from 8.1 percent for 2012 and to 7.4
percent from 7.7 percent for 2013.  Goldman Sachs cut its earnings growth  estimates  for CSI 300
companies for 2012 to 1.2 percent from 3.6 percent and for 2013
to 8 percent from 11.4 percent, strategists Helen Zhu and
Timothy Moe wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday. Interim
results were “weak” as the slowing economy “clearly weighed
on earnings,” the analysts wrote.  Bank Profits  Credit Suisse lowered its 12-month target for the Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index to 12,000 from 13,000, based on an
assumption of flat earnings growth for the next three years,
according to a report today. A stock rebound is likely in the
next three-to-six months on cheap valuations, the brokerage
said. Credit Suisse cut its profit estimates for lenders on
lower net interest margins and higher credit costs.  Construction Bank lost 2 percent to 3.90  yuan , the biggest
drop since June 25.  Bank of Communications Co.  sank 1.6 percent
to 4.21 yuan. China Minsheng Banking Corp. fell 1.7 percent to
5.68 yuan, the lowest close since Oct. 11.  Citigroup Inc. expects a better Chinese earnings outlook in
the second half, citing further policy easing and lower cost
pressures, according to a report dated yesterday. Policy makers
lowered  interest rates  in June and July after two reductions in
reserve-requirement ratios for lenders this year as the  economy 
expanded at the slowest pace since 2009 in the second quarter.  Fund Injection  China’s benchmark money-market rate fell today by the most
in six months as the central bank pumped money into the
financial system to help ease a cash shortage. The seven-day
repo rate, a gauge of interbank funding availability, slid 90
basis points, the most since Feb. 24, to 2.47 percent.  Moutai surged 6.2 percent to 233.43 yuan, the most since
Nov. 10, 2010. The company plans to raise factory prices for
some products by 20 percent to 30 percent, according to a
statement filed to the Shanghai exchange.  Citic Securities (600030)  advanced 0.6 percent to 10.58 yuan, the
highest close since Aug. 24. The company plans to pay as much as
150 million yuan for the stake in Shenzhen Qianhai Equity
Exchange, according to a statement to the  Shanghai Stock
Exchange .  The Shanghai Composite trades at 9.2 times estimated
profit, near the lowest levels since January, according to
weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The measure’s 30-day
volatility reading was at 12, compared with this year’s average
of 17.1. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands in the gauge
yesterday, about 23 percent lower than the daily average this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
