Iran  released two Azeris arrested in
May on espionage charges in the north-western city of Tabriz,
the privately owned Trend news service reported, citing
 Azerbaijan ’s Foreign Ministry.  Farid Huseynov and Sahriyar Hacizada, known in Azerbaijan
as poets, should be transferred to Baku tomorrow, according to
the report today. Elman Abdullayev, a spokesman for the Foreign
Ministry, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  Azerbaijan’s National Security Ministry sent Huseynov and
Hacizada to north-western Iran to recruit dissidents and promote
separatism, Iran’s English-language state television channel,
Press TV, said in July. The two men obtained confidential
information and images of “strategic locations and facilities”
in Tabriz, it said, citing an unidentified local official.  Relations between the two nations have deteriorated since
Azerbaijan said in February and March that it had foiled
attempts by Iranian-backed groups to carry out terrorist attacks
against Israeli and Western targets. Iran responded by accusing
Azerbaijan of working with  Israel ’s Mossad intelligence agency
in operations against Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
