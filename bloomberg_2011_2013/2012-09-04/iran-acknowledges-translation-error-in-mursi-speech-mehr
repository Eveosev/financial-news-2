Iran  acknowledged there was a
translation error in Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi’s speech
at the opening of the 16th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in
Tehran last week, the state-run Mehr news agency said.  “The shortcoming was only in one case of translating the
word ‘ Syria ’ into ‘Bahrain’ by one of the television channels,”
Mehr reported, citing Ezzatollah Zarghami, the head of Islamic
Republic of Iran Broadcasting. “A technical mistake occurred
during Channel One’s live broadcast and a translator made the
mistake by saying ‘Bahrain’ instead of ‘Syria.’”  Several Iranian state-owned channels including the Islamic
Republic of Iran News Network and Channel One translated Mursi’s
live speech into Farsi.  Mursi, in the first visit to Iran by an Egyptian head of
state since the 1979  Islamic Revolution , said in his speech that
the revolution in Egypt was the cornerstone for the Arab Spring,
and it was followed by Libya and Yemen and then in Syria against
its oppressive government, according to the Bahrain Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs .  Bahrain on Sept. 2 asked Iran to apologize for the
translation error. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement
saying he hadn’t named Bahrain, Mehr said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
