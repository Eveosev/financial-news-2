TPC Group Inc. (TPCG)  and its directors
were sued by an investor claiming a planned $628 million buyout
by private-equity firms is too low. He asked a state judge to
block the $40 per-share deal.  The offer for the Houston-based chemical maker “is
fundamentally unfair” to common stockholders, offering “a mere
1 percent premium,” shareholder-trustee Alvin Smilow contends
in a  Delaware  Chancery Court complaint filed today.  The case was filed a week after Thomas E. Sandal, chief
executive officer of Sandell Asset Management Corp. -- TPC’s
third-largest shareholder with a 7 percent stake -- called the
offer an “outrage” and well below a $57-per-share potential in
a year.  TPC, formerly known as Texas Petrochemicals Inc., is the
largest producer of butadiene, used to make synthetic rubber.
TPC on Aug. 27 announced the agreement with suitors First
Reserve Corp. based in Greenwich,  Connecticut , and SK Capital
Partners of  New York .  A TPC outside spokeswoman, Meaghan Repko of the Joele
Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher firm, said in a phone interview
that the company had no comment on the lawsuit.  TPC rose 83 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.86 in trading in
New York at 4:30 p.m.  The case is Smilow v. TPC Group, CA7829, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
