A Chinese government official who
allegedly beat a flight attendant in a dispute over where to
stow his carry-on luggage has been suspended from his post, the
state-run Xinhua  News Agency  said.  Fang Daguo, a Communist Party standing committee member in
the Guangzhou city district of Yuexiu, allegedly grabbed and
bruised the China Southern Airlines Co. attendant Aug. 29 after
she told him there was no room in the overhead bins to store his
luggage, according to Xinhua. Fang and his wife, who was also
involved in the dispute, “smelt strongly of alcohol” at the
time, Xinhua said, citing a passenger it didn’t identify.  The stewardess posted  photos  of bruises on her arms and
torn clothes on Sina Corp.’s Weibo microblogging service after
the incident, Xinhua reported. Fang and his wife have since
apologized, the news agency said.  An initial investigation by the local government found that
Fang’s wife had a brawl with the flight attendant, Xinhua said,
citing the district’s publicity department. The department
denied that Fang, who is also a political commissar of the
Yuexiu Armed Forces Department, beat the flight attendant,
Xinhua said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
