Bill Gross ’s  Pimco Total Return
Fund (PTTRX) , the world’s biggest mutual fund, attracted $1.3 billion
last month as it continued to outperform peers.  The eighth straight month of net deposits into the mutual
fund contributed to $9.3 billion in new cash for the year
through Aug. 31 and helped lift assets to $272.5 billion,
Chicago-based research firm  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  said today.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Total Return Fund
advanced 8.1 percent this year through last week, beating 97
percent of similarly managed mutual funds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gross had what he termed “ a stinker ” in 2011 after
eliminating U.S. Treasuries early in the year and missing a
rally as investors rushed to the safety of government-backed
debt. The Total Return Fund returned 4.2 percent last year,
trailing 70 percent of peers, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, his worst year since at least 1995. Clients pulled
out about $5 billion in 2011, according to Morningstar.  Pimco, based in Newport Beach, California, is a unit of the
Munich-based insurer Allianz SE.  Mark Porterfield , a spokesman for Pimco, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
