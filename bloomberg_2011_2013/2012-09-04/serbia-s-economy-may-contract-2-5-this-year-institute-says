Serbia’s economy may contract as
much as 2.5 percent this year on falling industrial and
agriculture output, the  Economics Institute  said in its first
report since the new government took office.  Industrial production has been lower on a year-on-year
basis every month since the start of 2012, and will probably
decline 4 percent over the first 10 months, the Belgrade-based
institute said today in a monthly survey of the economy. A bad
harvest because of a drought will also affect full-year gross
domestic product, it said. The central bank forecasts a 0.5
percent decline.  “We more or less agree with the central bank on inflation,
that it will reach 9 percent to 10 percent by the end of the
year,” Vladimir Vuckovic, the leader of the research team and a
member of the country’s Fiscal Council, said as he presented the
report. Over the first nine months, consumer prices are seen
growing 7.9 percent, he said.  “The level of industrial production in June is one of the
lowest since the crisis began in 2008,” Vuckovic said.
“Demand, both domestic and abroad, is clearly weakening.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
