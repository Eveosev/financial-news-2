Russia , the world’s third-biggest
 wheat exporter  last season, shipped about 2.5 million metric
tons of grains from Aug. 1 through Aug. 29 and prices for
cereals stabilized last week, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Exports included 2.1 million tons of wheat, 332,000 tons of
barley and 3,000 tons of corn, the ministry said in a statement
yesterday, without providing comparative numbers for last year.  About 4.6 million tons of grains have been shipped since
the season started July 1, compared with 5.7 million tons in
2011.  Grain prices stabilized on the domestic market last week
due to a “sufficient supply” of cereals from the new harvest,
except in the Volga, Ural and Siberian regions, where crops have
been damaged by drought, prompting purchases, the ministry said.  Average grain prices in Russia’s European part rose 0.4
percent period to 7,929 rubles ($246) a ton for third-grade
milling wheat in the week ended Sept. 2. Fourth-grade milling
wheat prices rose 0.2 percent to 7,638 rubles a ton and feed
wheat was up 0.3 percent at 7,264 rubles a ton, the ministry
said.  Russia’s wheat shipments are expected to fall 63 percent to
8 million tons in 2012-13, which would make it the fifth biggest
exporter after the U.S.,  Australia ,  Canada  and the European
Union, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Wheat for December delivery rose 1 percent to $8.98 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 11:37 a.m. Moscow time.
It’s gained 38 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
