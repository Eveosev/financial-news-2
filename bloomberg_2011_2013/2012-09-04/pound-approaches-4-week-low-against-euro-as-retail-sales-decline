The pound strengthened for a second
day against the euro after a survey showed the U.K. services
sector grew more than economists forecast last month.  Sterling advanced versus 12 of its 16 major counterparts as
European stocks declined, underpinning the attraction of U.K.
assets as a haven from the euro area debt crisis. A gauge of
British manufacturing released yesterday also beat the median
estimate of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . U.K.
government bonds rose.  “This spurt in the services sector, when put together with
manufacturing, shows composite U.K. activity is expanding,”
said  Gavin Friend , a foreign-exchange strategist at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in  London . “When compared with contraction
in the  euro zone , it’s sterling positive,”  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to 79.10 pence per euro
at 5:02 p.m. London time after gaining 0.1 percent yesterday.
The U.K. currency was little changed at $1.5885. It earlier
appreciated to $1.5910, the highest level since Aug. 23.  An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
services industry rose to 53.7, according to Markit Economics
and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply . The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was for a reading of 51.2. A
figure over 50 signals growth.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares declined 1.1 percent.  The pound has appreciated 1.2 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 0.6 percent, and
the euro rose 1 percent.  Gilts Gain  The benchmark 10-year gilt yields fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.64 percent, after earlier rising to
1.71 percent, the highest since Aug. 20. The 1.75 percent bond
due in September 2022 gained 0.21, or 2.10 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 101.125.  Gilts have returned 4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.8 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.7 percent.  The  Bank of England  will keep its key  interest rate  at a
record low 0.5 percent and hold its asset purchase target at 375
billion pounds at its monthly policy announcement on Sept. 6,
according to separate Bloomberg surveys of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
