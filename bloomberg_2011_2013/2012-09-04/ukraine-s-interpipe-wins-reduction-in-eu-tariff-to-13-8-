Ukraine’s  Interpipe  Group won a
reduction of more than a fifth in a European Union steel-pipe
tariff because the EU found the company had reduced price
undercutting.  The EU lowered the import duty applying to two Interpipe
units -- Interpipe Niko Tube and  Interpipe Nizhnedneprovsky Tube
Rolling Plant OJSC (NITR)  -- to 13.8 percent from 17.7 percent.  The levy is part of EU trade protection as high as 35.8
percent on seamless pipes and tubes from Ukraine and  Russia  to
help EU producers including  ArcelorMittal (MT)  counter below-cost --
or “dumped” -- imports. The bloc said organizational changes
at Interpipe, including a merger between two production
companies and a streamlining of the sales operations, led to a
lower dumping margin.  “The changes are of a lasting nature,” the 27-nation EU
said in a decision made in Brussels on Aug. 28 and published
today in the  Official Journal . The decision, due to take effect
tomorrow, is the outcome of a 13-month review of the duty that
Interpipe had requested.  Separately, the EU renewed for five years a 47.4 percent
anti-dumping duty on imports from  China  of a metal component for
binders called lever-arch mechanisms. The bloc published that
decision in the  Official Journal  today as well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
