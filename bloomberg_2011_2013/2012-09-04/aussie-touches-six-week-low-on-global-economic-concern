Australia ’s dollar touched its
lowest level in more than seven weeks as growth in the nation
slowed more than forecast in the second quarter.  The so-called Aussie fell to a six-week low versus the yen
before reports today that may show euro-area retail sales
dropped in July and services shrank last month. Data yesterday
showed a contraction in U.S. manufacturing. Demand for  New
Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, was supported after
figures showed the value of the nation’s construction rose.  “The incoming anecdotal evidence from key resource
companies in Australia remains poor,” said  Sue Trinh , a senior
currency strategist in  Hong Kong  at Royal Bank of  Canada . “The
outlook for Aussie remains rather poor given the deterioration
in the global growth backdrop as well.”  The Australian dollar lost 0.4 percent to $1.0183 at 5:47
p.m. in Sydney after earlier touching $1.0174, the lowest since
July 13. It reached 79.76 yen, the weakest since July 25, before
trading at 79.83, 0.5 percent lower than yesterday’s close. New
Zealand’s currency bought 79.24 U.S. cents from 79.45 yesterday.
It dropped 0.3 percent to 62.12 yen.  Australia’s 10-year yield declined five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to close at 3.04 percent. New Zealand’s
two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, slid 5.5 basis points to 2.625 percent.  Below Estimates  Australia’s  gross domestic product  advanced 0.6 percent in
the second quarter from the previous three months, when it rose
a revised 1.4 percent, a Bureau of Statistics report released
today showed. The result compared with the median of 26
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey for a 0.7 percent gain.  In New Zealand, the  value of construction  increased 0.8
percent to NZ$1.7 billion ($1.35 billion) in the second quarter
after a 0.4 percent drop in the three months through March,
 Statistics New Zealand  said today. Residential building jumped
7.1 percent and non-residential work fell 5.6 percent.  The Aussie has declined 4.3 percent in the past month, the
worst performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The kiwi
posted the second-biggest drop, falling 3.8 percent.  “There’s still a theme of very weak economic data out of
the  euro zone ,” said  Imre Speizer , a strategist in Auckland at
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s second-largest lender. “Both
the Aussie and kiwi have turned down and are heading towards the
bottom” of their ranges, he said.  Sales in the euro region probably fell 0.2 percent in July
after advancing 0.2 percent the previous month, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before the
European Union’s statistics office releases the figures today. A
final reading due today of an index based on a survey of
purchasing managers in  services industries  in the currency bloc
may confirm a drop to 47.5 in August from 47.9 in July, a
separate poll showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
