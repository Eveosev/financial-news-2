Dick Clark Productions, the producer
of “New Year’s Rockin’ Eve,” “The Golden Globes” and other
TV shows, agreed to be acquired by Guggenheim Partners LLC,
Mandalay Entertainment and Mosaic Media Investment Partners LLC.  The investment group expects to complete the purchase of
the company from RedZone Capital Management “expeditiously,”
according to a statement today. The terms weren’t disclosed.  The deal comes almost five months after the death of Dick
Clark, who started the production company in 1957. Dick Clark
Productions created “The Golden Globes” Hollywood foreign-press
award show, “The American Music Awards,” “The Academy of Country
Music Awards,” the “Bloopers” franchise and “The $10,000
Pyramid” game show and its many spinoffs. At one point in the
1980s, Clark was hosting shows on all three major networks and
in syndication.  “We look forward to continuing DCP’s production of branded
entertainment that has become a part of the American lexicon,”
Todd Boehly, president of Guggenheim Partners, a New York-based
investment firm, said in the statement. “We plan to work
closely with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the
Academy of Country Music and all of the network partners and
sponsors to ensure DCP’s long-term growth and success.”  The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the company
was expected to fetch more than $350 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
