German 10-year bund futures may
rally more than 2 percent to a six-week high should they close
above a key level of so-called resistance, UBS AG said, citing
trading patterns.  The contract expiring in September may climb to 146.26, the
July 23 high, should it close above 144.17, the 62 percent
retracement of the sell-off in July and August,  Richard Adcock ,
head of fixed-income technical strategy at UBS in  London , wrote
today in a note to clients, referring to Fibonacci analysis.  “If 144.17 is broken on a closing basis it would suggest a
more prolonged rally is on the cards,” Adcock wrote in an e-
mailed response to questions. Investors should sell the contract
should the price reach 146.20, he said.  The bund futures  contract  expiring in September dropped 0.1
percent to 143.47 at 2:44 p.m. London time, after falling as low
as 143.02.  A break below support at 143, the 38 percent retracement of
the August recovery, would suggest this move has further
downside potential, with the next area of support at the 62
percent level of 142.15, Adcock said.  Resistance refers to an area where analysts anticipate
orders to sell an asset to be grouped. Support refers to an area
on a chart where orders to buy a security may be clustered.
Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
