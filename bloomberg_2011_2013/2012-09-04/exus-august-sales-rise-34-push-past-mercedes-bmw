Toyota Motor Corp. (7201) ’s Lexus, which
lost its crown as the top-selling luxury auto brand in the U.S.
last year, boosted sales 34 percent last month to move past
 Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. (BMW)   It’s the first time the Japanese luxury brand beat both of
its German competitors to be No. 1 in monthly sales since
December 2010 before inventory was hurt by last year’s natural
disasters in  Asia . Lexus sold 24,237 vehicles in August, the
Toyota City, Japan-based company said in a statement yesterday.  While Lexus won the month, it still trails Mercedes by
almost 18,000 and BMW by more than 14,000. Toyota’s brand has a
“very low” chance of closing such a large gap in the final
four months of 2012, said  Jesse Toprak , an industry analyst with
TrueCar.com, a website that follows auto sales.  “You can’t count them out,” he said yesterday. “This
month was a great example of Lexus’s resilience in terms of
their brand loyalty and the potential they can tap into if they
become aggressive with their marketing efforts.”  U.S. sales of Mercedes rose 11 percent to 20,557 last
month, extending its lead in the race for the luxury crown this
year to more than 3,800 over BMW. Mercedes U.S. sales through
August rose 14 percent to 168,462, according to the Stuttgart,
Germany-based automaker.  “With an all-time record setting year so far and now with
exciting product in the pipeline, including the all-new GL-Class
currently on its way to dealers across the country, we plan to
build on this momentum through the end of the year,”  Steve Cannon , head of Mercedes in the U.S., said in a statement.  BMW Slides  Mercedes’ expanded on its previous lead over BMW of more
than 100 U.S. deliveries through July. The sales results don’t
include Daimler’s cargo vans and Smart cars and BMW’s Mini
brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  The BMW brand, helped in July by incentives aimed at
encouraging dealers to buy demo vehicles, declined 19 percent in
August to 16,835. BMW, which overtook Lexus last year to become
the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S., sold 164,636 through
August, a 5.6 percent gain, the Munich-based company said. BMW
beat Mercedes last year by 2,715 deliveries in the U.S.  “August numbers showed how tight the supply of new
vehicles has been for us,” Ludwig Willisch, head of BMW of
 North America , said in a statement.  Willisch has predicted that the BMW brand will again finish
No. 1 following the introduction of the redesigned 3 Series
sedan. The all-wheel-drive version of the compact sedan and new
X1 compact sport-utility vehicle are expected to boost company
sales, BWM has said.  ‘Ambitious Plans’  “All indicators show sales momentum increasing and with
the model year change now complete, we have ambitious plans for
the months ahead,” Willisch said in the statement.  BMW U.S. deliveries fell 0.5 percent in July. Before that
month, the last time BMW had a year-over-year sales decline in
the U.S. was in May 2010 when the company had limited
availability of the 5 Series and X3 sport-utility vehicle before
redesigned versions arrived at dealerships.  Through August,  Lexus  sales gained 25 percent to 150,604.
Toyota has targeted a 25 percent increase to 250,000 vehicles
this year.  The new Lexus ES, which went on sale last month, and GS
sedans were important for boosting the luxury brand’s sales, Tim Morrison, vice president of Lexus sales, told reporters on a
conference call yesterday.  ‘Big One’  “ES was the last big one that we were waiting for,” he
said. “Between GS, LX and RX and RX hybrid and the GS F-Sport,
and the ES and ES hybrid, just all of that has come together for
us nicely.”  Lexus also had its annual “Golden Opportunities” sales
event, he said.  Sales of Tokyo-based  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s Acura brand rose 73
percent to 15,646 last month, the company said in a statement.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac sales, helped by the new XTS
full-sized sedan, rose 11 percent to 14,704 vehicles in August,
the Detroit-based automaker said in a statement.  U.S. sales of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi brand rose 13 percent
last month to 11,527, the company said in a statement.  Porsche AG, the Stuttgart-based automaker that is now part
of VW, sold 3,026 vehicles in the U.S. last month, a 39 percent
increase, the company said in a statement.  Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti sold 11,155 vehicles last
month, a 24 percent gain from a year earlier, the Yokohama,
Japan-based company said in a statement.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 8,141 Lincolns in August, a 1.7 percent
increase from a year earlier, according to a statement from the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Jaguar Land Rover deliveries rose 31 percent to 4,756, the
U.K. brands said in an e-mailed statement. Mumbai-based  Tata
Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  owns Jaguar Land Rover.  To contact the reporter on this story:
