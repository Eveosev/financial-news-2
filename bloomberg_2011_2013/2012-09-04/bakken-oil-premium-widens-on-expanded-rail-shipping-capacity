Bakken oil traded at the most
expensive compared with West Texas Intermediate in four months
as Burlington Northern  Santa Fe  boosted crude rail shipping
capacity for the grade to 1 million barrels a day.  The increase of more than 25 percent over the past year
covers shipments of crude from the Bakken-producing Williston
Basin region in  North Dakota  and  Montana , Krista York-Woolley, a
spokeswoman for the railroad owned by  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ,
said in an e-mail.  Bakken strengthened $4 to a premium of $1 above the U.S.
benchmark at 3:54 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the most expensive the graded has traded at
since May 3.  Canadian oils also strengthened. Syncrude’s premium added
$6.25 to $8.25 above WTI. Western Canada Select’s discount to
West Texas Intermediate narrowed $4.50 to $11.50 a barrel.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast grades strengthened. Light Louisiana
Sweet’s premium to WTI widened $1 to $17.70. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet increased 55 cents to $17.95 over WTI.  Poseidon’s  premium  increased 80 cents to $13.65. Mars Blend
added 75 cents to $13.50 a barrel over WTI. Southern Green
Canyon’s premium widened by 75 cents to $12.25.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, dropped 25 cents to a
premium of $16.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
