Volkswagen AG (VOW)  Chairman Ferdinand
Piech said the company’s Seat unit is “heading in the right
direction” and that investors should wait for a resolution to
the German company’s dispute with  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)   Asked why VW is keeping its stake in Suzuki, Piech told
reporters to “wait and see” and that it’s a “company
secret.” Seat, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company’s Spanish
unit, has suffered from plunging sales amid the debt crisis,
raising questions about its future.  Piech said he sees “no” competitors as a serious threat
to the German automaker and that its greatest challenge is
“arrogance in the company’s ranks.”  Piech and other VW executives were speaking at the
introduction of the new Golf model in Berlin. The company
announced a base price for the model of 16,975 euros ($21,329).  To contact the reporter on this story:
