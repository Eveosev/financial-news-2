An outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever killed 14 people in northeastern Democratic Republic of
Congo by Sept. 1, the  World Health Organization  said.  Thirty cases of the virus have been reported around the
town of Isiro in Congo’s Orientale province since last month,
the Geneva-based organization said in a Sept. 2 report, while
169 people are under surveillance in the region.  Ebola is one of the most virulent viral diseases on earth,
according to the WHO. It’s transmitted through contact with
blood or bodily fluids of an infected person or wild animal,
according to the organization’s website. The virus was first
identified in Sudan and Congo in 1976, WHO says.  An Ebola outbreak last month in neighboring  Uganda  killed
17 people, WHO reported on its website.  “These two Ebola outbreaks are not epidemiologically
linked and have been caused by two different Ebola subtypes,”
WHO said yesterday on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
