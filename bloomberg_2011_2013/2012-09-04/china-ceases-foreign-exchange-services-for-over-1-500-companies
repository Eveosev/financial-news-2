China ’s currency regulator suspended
more than 1,500 companies from using trade-related foreign-
exchange services following record capital outflows.  The companies were found to be “shell corporates,” which
didn’t conduct any business as of the end of August, the State
Admistration of Foreign Exchange said in a  statement  posted on
its website yesterday. The authority also restricted its
services, which include settlement and conversion, for about 700
companies owing to unlawful activities, it said.  “It could be part of the measures to block loopholes as
capital outflows have been quite strong recently”,’’ said Zhang Zhiwei, a Hong Kong-based chief China economist at Nomura
Holdings Inc. by phone today.  The nation reported a $71.4 billion capital-account deficit
for the three months through June, the biggest quarterly
shortfall in data going back to 1998. China started streamlining
foreign-exchange controls for cross-border trade in goods at the
start of last month to support exports, which rose in July at
the slowest pace since January.  As the  yuan  has weakened 0.7 percent this year, China has
been experiencing capital outflows of between $20 billion and
$40 billion each month since late 2011,  Nick Chamie , head of
global currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto,
estimated in an Aug. 24 report.  In April, SAFE said it had uncovered more than 15,000 cases
of “illegal and irregular foreign-exchange transactions”
between 2007 and 2011, resulting in fines totaling 1.27 billion
yuan ($200 million). Two calls to SAFE’s press office today went
unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
