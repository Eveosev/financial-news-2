FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ,  South Africa ’s
second-biggest financial-services company, climbed the most two
weeks after saying full-year profit increased as much as 29
percent.  Shares in the lender added 1.2 percent, the most since Aug.
21, to close at 27.71 rand in Johannesburg, after earlier rising
as much as 3 percent. The stock has gained 34 percent this year,
outpacing a 19 percent rally in the six-member  FTSE/JSE Africa
Banks Index (JBNKS) , which advanced less than 0.1 percent today.  Earnings per share adjusted for one-time items rose between
24 percent and 29 percent from the 183.1 cents reported last
year, FirstRand said in a statement today, beating the 17
percent expected by a poll of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
 Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , South Africa’s third-biggest bank, said on July
27 first-half profit declined 8.6 percent after it set aside
more money for bad loans.  “They have been gaining quite a bit of retail customers
and that’s translating into higher net interest income,” Faizal Moola, a banking analyst at Avior Research Ltd. in  Cape Town ,
said by phone. “There would have been a slight increase in bad
debt, but not to the extent of Absa.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
