Manufacturing probably teetered between growth and contraction in August, a sign the pillar of the recovery is now struggling, according economists surveyed before a report today.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  factory index  was little changed at 50 compared with 49.8 in July, according to the median estimate of 70 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between shrinking and expanding. Spending on construction projects probably rose in July, other figures may show.  The possibility that taxes will rise and government outlays will fall if U.S. lawmakers don’t act by January may shake confidence and cause consumers and businesses to curb spending. The  European debt crisis  represents another stumbling block that threatens to limit orders to American factories.  “Domestic uncertainty and global weakness are both restraining growth in manufacturing,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an economist at BNP Paribas in  New York . “It’s a weak sector of the economy right now. We don’t expect a lot of pickup in investment activity this year.”  The Tempe, Arizona-based ISM will release the report at 10 a.m. New York time. Estimates ranged from 48.7 to 51.5. The group has said that an  index (S15MACH)  reading above 42.5, while signaling contraction in manufacturing, is generally consistent with an expanding overall economy. The gauge averaged 55.2 in 2011 and 57.3 in 2010.  Regional Reports  Other reports show manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the  U.S. economy , weakened last month. Factory activity in the New York region contracted in August for the first time in 10 months, and production in the Philadelphia-area shrank for a fourth month, Federal Reserve reports showed.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc.’s business barometer also  fell  in August, indicating manufacturer’s pace of expansion was slowing and that companies may hold the line on production until sales pick up.  “Many districts reported some softening in manufacturing, either a slowdown in the rate of growth or a decline in the level of sales, output or orders” the Fed said last week in its Beige Book business survey, which reflected information collected on or before Aug. 20.  The slump at factories comes as 8.3-percent unemployment restrains consumer demand and slowing global growth reduces new businesses orders.  Household spending  increased at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the smallest advance in a year, Commerce Department data show. Corporate spending on equipment and software rose at a 4.7 percent pace in that period, the weakest since the third quarter of 2009.  Bernanke’s View  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week said more bond purchases are an option as central bankers weigh further steps to spur growth. He said long periods of high unemployment produce “enormous suffering and waste of human talent” and also risk causing “structural damage on our economy that could last for many years.”  The production outlook also depends on whether global growth continues to cool, damping demand. The euro-area economy shrank from April to June, the third straight quarter without expansion, according to the European Union’s statistics office.  China ’s growth decelerated last quarter from a year earlier for the six consecutive time.  “We remain cognizant that there is the potential for further deterioration of the world economies,” Rick Cote, president and chief operating officer of watchmaker  Movado Group Inc. (MOV) , said during an Aug. 28 earnings call. “Our plans continue to anticipate moderate growth in  North America , modest growth in Northern Europe, declines in Southern Europe and solid growth in  Asia  and  South America .”  Manufacturing Stocks  Shares of manufacturers have fallen behind the market as a result of the weakness. The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Industrial Machinery Index has advanced 5.2 percent since the end of 2011, compared with a 12 percent gain in the broader  S&P 500 .  A healthier housing market could help manufacturers by bolstering demand for more durable goods, like furniture and refrigerators. Economists project  construction spending  rose 0.4 percent in July, a fourth consecutive gain, according to survey median ahead of the 10 a.m. report from the Commerce Department.  Stronger auto production would also help keep factories humming. The  pace  of car and light truck sales in August, data released at the end of the day, probably rose from a rate of 14.1 million units in the prior month, economists forecast.
