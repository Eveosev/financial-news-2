Oil products shipped by sea will
gain 9.7 percent during the next four years, amid a change in
trading routes led by rising refining capacity in  Asia  and the
Middle East, said  DVB Bank SE (DVB) , a transportation lender.  Seaborne volumes will rise to 902 million metric tons by
2015, as shipments from Asia, the largest exporter of refined
products, advance 6.7 percent and exports from Western  Europe ,
the second-biggest shipper, contract as refineries shut, the
Rotterdam-based bank said.  Asian exports will rise to 160 million tons over the
period, as volumes shipped from Europe fall to 120 million tons
by 2015, from 117 million tons last year, according to an e-
mailed report today from the bank’s research and strategic
planning division.  European exports of light distillates, which include
naphtha, gasoline and ethanol that accounted for about 23
percent of the region’s cargoes in 2011 will fall 15 percent
over the next few years, DVB said.  North America , which became a net exporter of oil products
for the first time since 1949 last year, will boost shipments by
14 percent over the next three years, DVB forecast, due to
demand in  Latin America , and for the 2016 Olympics in  Brazil .
That may change how so-called Medium-Range tankers which carry
cargoes of 35,000 to 50,000 tons of refined products are
deployed, the report said.  “If North America’s capacity to produce gasoline continues
to exceed domestic demand, the importance of the traditional
Europe-to-East Coast North America product tanker trade route
could greatly diminish,” the report said.  New Routes  Routes for product tankers are changing as new refineries
in Asia and the  Middle East  replace those in Europe. Middle East
exports will rise 19 percent from 2011 to reach 111 million tons
in 2015, led by cargoes to Asia, while Indian exports will
advance 28 percent over the same period, DVB said.      Exports
of refined products out of the Baltic/Black Sea region will
expand by 5 percent, led by demand from Europe, according to the
report said.  Cargo demand growth will most benefit the largest product
tankers, so called Long Range 2 vessels able to haul 90,000-ton
cargoes, with demand for them rising 17 percent over the next
four years, according to DVB. There are 2,990 vessels in the
product tanker fleet, the bank said, with 334 vessels on order.  The global fleet will remain oversupplied in 2012, and
rates may improve by early 2013 as Middle East refining capacity
rises if older vessels are scrapped and removed from trading,
DVB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
