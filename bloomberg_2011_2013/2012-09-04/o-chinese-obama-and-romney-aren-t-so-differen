Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s promise to  get tough with China  may fall on receptive ears in the U.S., but in China his vow has barely registered, much less caused alarm. Unlike in 2008, when the Chinese media and bloggers  were intensely focused  on the unexpected rise of Barack Obama, the current election has generated limited media coverage and online discussion. To an extent, this shouldn’t be surprising. China is in the midst of a once-per-decade, totally opaque and undemocratic  national leadership transition  (expected this fall but still unscheduled). Those Chinese who care about politics understandably care more about their own. If there’s one theme that’s emerged from the limited Chinese reaction to Romney and the  Republican National Convention , it’s that there’s little in Romney’s rhetoric about China that hasn’t been heard in prior elections. Romney’s in favor of imposing tariffs on Chinese exports if the country’s  devalued currency  isn’t revalued by his first day in office; he’s for selling  more arms to Taiwan ; and he definitely wants  more  aggressive democracy promotion . Instead, what’s changed is a greater Chinese national sense that status as the world’s second largest economy (with a  modernizing military, to boot ) absolves it from having to worry about -- much less answer to -- that rhetoric. This sentiment is expressed in an unsigned editorial published last Thursday in the hypernationalist, state-owned Global Times newspaper. Headlined “ America Slaps China in the Face, but We Have the Power to Kick Back ,” the paper sniffs at Romney’s threats. The editorial opens by recalling the days when U.S. trade policy was an effective means of controlling China: President  Barack Obama  isn’t mentioned in the editorial, but he might as well be: The state-owned press uses  nearly identical language  to critique the Obama administration and its approach to China on almost a daily basis. From the perspective of the state media, there’s little difference between the two candidates when it comes to China. Last Monday, Guangzhou Daily, the official newspaper of Guangzhou’s Communist Party, made this point explicit in an  editorial by Dang Jianjun , a commentator with the paper, which dissects the Republican Party platform and its aggressive military posturing toward China. Unsurprisingly, Dang concludes that the Republican platform reaffirms rather than supplants the Obama administration’s  “pivot” to Asia  -- a policy shift designed to highlight U.S. interests in the region via diplomatic and military means, such as the decision to send  2,500 U.S. troops to Australia : Still, from the perspective of China’s blogs and microblogs, Mitt Romney is no Barack Obama. Obama is the more complicated figure who captured Chinese imaginations in 2008: a politician but also a potent rebuke to  China ’s ruling oligarchy and the limited opportunities that someone of modest background has to join its ruling classes. Whatever his failings in the eyes of many Chinese, Obama's ability to rise from a humble upbringing to the pinnacle of American power is well-known and embraced. Meanwhile, Romney’s background as the wealthy son of another politician is interesting to most Chinese only insofar as it echoes the  aristocratic “princeling” sons  of past leaders who wield considerable power in contemporary China (Xi Jinping, the incoming Chinese president, is one). Still, few in China are under the impression that just because he comes from modest circumstances, Obama is sympathetic to their modest (but rapidly improving) circumstances. Rather, Obama's just an updated model of an American presidential candidate with no regard for China. Romney, in the eyes of some Chinese microbloggers, is actually more upfront about his antipathy toward China, and thus preferable to the hard-to-pin-down Obama. Wang Yilin, a student in Hainan province, takes up this notion in a  tweet  to the Tencent microblog: Wang’s is a particularly colorful means of expressing Chinese boredom with the current election, but it’s by no means an outlier. Among Chinese university and policy elites, similar views -- expressed in a duller fashion -- are making the rounds on microblogs. Frequently, the tweets exhibit an uncanny savvy about two-party politics and a bold confidence about how little China has to fear. On Sunday, Lin Jue, the director of the World Economic Institute at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, summarized those feeling via a  tweet  from her account on Sina Weibo, China’s leading microblog: If there were an emoticon that could properly express a sigh, Lin no doubt would’ve added it to the end of her tweet. Nonetheless, as dull and predictable as the current election is for Chinese observers, there’s an unmistakable irony in those who lack votes critiquing the choices available to those who have them. Predictably, China’s strictly supervised newspapers aren’t on-record pointing out that irony. But, here and there, bloggers and microbloggers touch on it. Sometimes they do it explicitly, but the more powerful instances are often when they do it implicitly, as one anonymous Beijing microblogger did on Thursday, via Sina Weibo. Subtly,  the tweet  refers to the fall's expected Communist Party leadership transition: Mitt Romney  might not be much of a choice in the eyes of many Chinese -- boiled cabbage next to Obama’s boiled chicken -- but at least he is one. For now, though, that’s not enough to generate interest in a race that few Chinese believe can have any measurable impact on their country.
