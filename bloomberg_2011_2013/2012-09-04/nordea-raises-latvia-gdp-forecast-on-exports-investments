Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  more than doubled its
forecast for Latvia’s  economic growth  this year to 4.2 percent
from 2 percent estimated in June, citing strong exports and
fixed investments.  Still, growth will slow in the second half due to the
effects of the euro area’s debt crisis, the largest Nordic
lender said in its economic outlook today. Economic output will
decelerate to 2.5 percent next year, down from the bank’s June
forecast of 5 percent.  Latvia’s rolling 12-month inflation is still “slightly”
above the 3 percent level, about the  reference rate  which the
country needs to meet next spring to qualify for euro adoption
in 2014, Nordea said. A potential increase in food prices
“would have a significant impact on inflation in  Latvia  as the
weight of food in the consumption basket is among the highest in
the EU,” it added.  The bank also slightly raised its GDP forecast for Latvia’s
northern neighbor  Estonia  this year to 2.3 percent. It cut both
Estonia’s and Lithuania’s growth outlook for next year, to 3.5
percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
