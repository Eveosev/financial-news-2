The forint, the world’s second-best
performing currency against the euro this year, may weaken as
Hungary faces delays in aid talks with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union, Citigroup Inc. said.  The forint appreciated less than 0.1 percent to 284.5 by
4:50 p.m. in Budapest, extending its gains in 2012 to 11
percent, the most worldwide after the Chilean peso. Yields on
the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.375 percent.  Hungarian assets rallied as Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s
government held a first round of talks with the IMF and EU in
July after eight months of delays caused by a dispute over
legislation threatening the independence of the central bank. A
separate plan to tax central  bank transactions  approved in July
risks complicating the negotiations on a  credit line  again,
Citigroup said today.  “It is uncertain if talks will resume in September,”
 Eszter Gargyan , a Budapest-based economist at the bank, wrote in
an e-mailed report today. “Investors will likely be
disappointed about local news in the coming months,” she wrote,
adding that Citigroup sees “risks skewed toward a weaker”
forint against the euro.  There may be no progress toward the bailout in the short-
term without market pressure, Gargyan wrote.  Hungary will continue aid talks in September, Zoltan
Csefalvay, a state secretary at the Economy Ministry, said in an
interview today in Krynica, southern Poland, without specifying
a date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
