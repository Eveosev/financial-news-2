Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , based in
Springdale,  Arkansas , will seek to quickly resolve a temporary
ban on frozen boneless-pork shipments to Russia, the company
said.  Russia barred imports of the product from Tyson Fresh Meats
Inc., a division of Tyson Foods, after laboratory tests found
listeria in the meat, according to the national food-safety
watchdog, known as Rosselkhoznadzor. The temporary ban will take
effect on Sept. 12.  “We’re looking into the claims by Russian officials and
will work diligently to quickly resolve this matter,” Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for the U.S. meat producer, said by e-
mail yesterday. “Providing safe, high quality pork is extremely
important to our business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
