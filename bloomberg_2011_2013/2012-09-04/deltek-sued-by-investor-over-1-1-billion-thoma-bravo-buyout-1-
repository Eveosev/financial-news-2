Deltek Inc. (PROJ) , a provider of computer
software for government contractors, was sued by a shareholder
who claims investors will be shortchanged in a planned
$1.1 billion all-cash takeover by Thoma Bravo LLC.  The shareholder, Stephen Bushansky, said in a complaint
made public today in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington that
directors have a duty to get the best price and that the $13-a-
share offer is inadequate.  “The proposed acquisition is fundamentally unfair” to
shareholders, Bushansky said in court papers. “Indeed, the
merger consideration represents a 7.2 percent discount to the
stock’s closing price of $14.01 per share on Aug. 24, 2012, the
last trading date before defendants entered into the merger
agreement.”  Deltek said Aug. 27 that it agreed to the $13 price and
that Thoma Bravo’s offer is 14.6 times Deltek’s earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the past 12
months as of June 30.  Bushansky said in his complaint that on Aug. 1, Greg McDowell, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC, set the target price
at $16 a share.  Patrick Smith , a Deltek spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the
lawsuit.  Thoma Bravo, which specializes in investing in software,
education and financial-services companies, said it plans to
expand Herndon, Virginia-based Deltek through a combination of
acquisitions and internal growth.  Deltek rose 4 cents to $12.98 at 12:43 p.m. in  New York .  The case is Bushansky v. Deltek Inc., CA7827, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
