About 10 percent of the U.S. corn
crop was harvested as of Sept. 2, compared with 6 percent a week
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a
weekly report. Approximately 30 percent of the soybean crop,
which is harvested later than corn, was rated good or excellent,
unchanged from a week earlier, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
