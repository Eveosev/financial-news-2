Thoroughbred racehorse owner  Mike Repole  and trainer  Todd Pletcher  each won their third
consecutive titles at the 40-day meet at Saratoga Race Course,
the New York Racing Association Inc. said.  Ramon Dominguez set a meet record for wins by a jockey with
68 to beat the mark set by  John Velazquez  in 2004 by four. He
rode six winners in a day on both July 22 and Sept. 2.  Repole, chairman of Pirate’s Booty all-natural snacks and
Energy Kitchen fast-food eateries, had 13 winners during the
meet at the Saratoga Springs, New York-based track. In 2009, his
horses went 0-36.  Pletcher, who won 36 races including seven with Repole’s
horses, amassed his ninth career H. Allen Jerkens training
title. He was also Saratoga’s leading trainer in 1998 and from
2002-06.  To contact the reporter on this story:
