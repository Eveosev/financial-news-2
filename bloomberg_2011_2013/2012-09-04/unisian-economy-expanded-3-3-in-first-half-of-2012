Tunisia’s economy grew 3.3 percent
in the first half of 2012, the state statistics institute said.  Tunisia’s gross domestic produce expanded 2.1 percent in
the second quarter from a year earlier, the institute said on
its website today. The economy shrank 1.8 percent last year amid
protests and the subsequent unstable political situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
