The U.S. Open tennis tournament this
year will have its first Italian woman semifinalist since 1930,
thanks to a couple of upsets in the fourth round.  Roberta Vinci, seeded 20th, defeated second seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland 6-1, 6-4 yesterday to set up a quarterfinal
match against 10th seed  Sara Errani , who won 7-6 (7-5), 6-3
against Angelique Kerber, the sixth seed from Germany.  The winner of the Vinci-Errani match will become the first
Italian woman to reach the U.S. Open’s final four since Baroness
Maude Giacomo Levi advanced to the semifinals 82 years ago.  “I’m happy to play against her, for sure an Italian goes
to the semifinal,” Vinci said in a news conference. “She’s my
best friend, so I’m very happy to play against her.”  Errani, 25, and Vinci, 29, will compete as partners today
in the quarterfinals of the women’s doubles, where they are the
No. 2 seeds. They’ve already won seven doubles titles this year,
including at the  French Open .  The previous Italian women’s singles semifinalist at the
 U.S. Open  was a native Chicagoan who grew up as Maude Rosenbaum
and then competed for  Italy  after marrying Baron Giacomo Giorgio
Levi in 1927.  The baroness, who died in 1981 in New York at the age of
79, was divorced from the baron in February 1934 and married New
York stockbroker H. Walter Blumenthal in 1935.  The last Italian man to reach the U.S. Open semifinals was
Corrado Barazzutti in 1977.  Errani reached this year’s French Open final before losing
to  Maria Sharapova , while Vinci is in the quarterfinals of a
major for the first time in her career.  To contact the reporters on this story:
