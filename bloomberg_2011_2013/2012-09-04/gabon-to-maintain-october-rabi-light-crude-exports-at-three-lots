Gabon will maintain exports of its
Rabi Light crude for October unchanged from September at three
cargoes of 650,000 barrels each, according to a loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Shipments of Rabi Blend will be three cargoes of 600,000
barrels each, one less than September, the plan showed.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc operates the Rabi Blend field, while
 Total SA (FP)  runs the Rabi Light project.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
