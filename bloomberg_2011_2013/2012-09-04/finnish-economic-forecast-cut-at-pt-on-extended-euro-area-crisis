Finland’s economy will expand at a
slower rate than previously forecast as the European sovereign
debt crisis weighs on export demand, the Labour Institute for
Economic Research, or PT, said.  Finland’s economy will grow 1.4 percent this year, less
than the 1.9 percent growth forecast on April 3. Next year, the
economy will expand 2 percent, compared with the 2.6 percent
April estimate, Helsinki-based PT said in an e-mailed statement
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
