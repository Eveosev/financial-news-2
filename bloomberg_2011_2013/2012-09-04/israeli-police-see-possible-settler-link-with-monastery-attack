Israeli police are investigating the
possibility that an attack on a monastery was meant as
retaliation for the eviction of Jewish settlers from a  West Bank 
outpost.  Vandals painted the walls of the Latrun monastery with
anti-Christian graffiti and set fire to the front door early
today, said  Micky Rosenfeld , a police spokesman. The graffiti
also made reference to the Migron outpost, which was cleared of
settlers by police two days ago, he said.  “There’s a strong possibility that the two incidents are
linked,” Rosenfeld said in a telephone interview. “We have a
special investigation team looking into it.” The monastery is
halfway between  Tel Aviv  and Jerusalem.  Israeli authorities have clashed in recent years with
settlers behind a campaign called “price tag,” which has
defaced mosques in the West Bank and threatened Israeli peace
campaigners. The settlers reject Palestinian claims to the West
Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
War.  “We hold the Israeli government fully responsible,”  Saeb Erakat , the chief Palestinian peace negotiator, said in an e-
mailed statement. “The settlers’ actions amount to terrorism.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
