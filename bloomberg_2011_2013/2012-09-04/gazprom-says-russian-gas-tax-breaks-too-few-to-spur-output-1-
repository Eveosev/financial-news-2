OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , the world’s biggest
natural-gas producer, will lobby the Russian government to
expand gas tax breaks to spur investment and boost output.  A number of projects may be barely profitable or may lose
money as the government increases extraction taxes, Gazprom said
today in an e-mailed statement. Measures offered by the
government won’t allow Gazprom to reach a 12 percent rate of
return at its Arctic Prirazlomnoye field or the Kirinskoye
project in the  Far East , it said.  The extraction tax rate should be cut to zero to encourage
the development of projects in  Russia ’s east and possibly for
the offshore, the Moscow-based company said.  The Economy Ministry will take a “tough stance” on
Gazprom’s demands for more tax breaks, Sergei Belyakov, a deputy
minister, told reporters today in Moscow. The state-run company
should focus on cutting its expenditure, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
