Two Egyptian fishermen were killed
and two others wounded when a Tunisian navy vessel opened fire
on their boat, which had illegally entered the country’s waters,
 Tunisia ’s  Defense Ministry  said.  The fishermen’s vessel was among a group of about 10
Egyptian boats intercepted off Tunisia’s southern Kerkennah
islands, the ministry said in a faxed statement late yesterday.  The authorities “were obliged to open fire when the
Egyptian vessels failed to comply with orders to stop,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
