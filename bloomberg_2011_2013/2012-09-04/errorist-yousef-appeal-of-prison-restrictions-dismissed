A challenge to prison conditions by
Ramzi Yousef, who is serving a life sentence plus 240 years for
masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, was dismissed
by a U.S. appeals court in  New York .  Yousef, 44, is seeking a lifting of restrictions under
which he has been incarcerated since 1998 in the maximum-
security federal prison in Florence, Colorado. Those measures
bar him from having physical contact with other inmates and
severely limit his communications with anyone outside the
prison, his attorney, Bernard V. Kleinman, told the federal
appeals panel in New York last month.  The appeals court said today in a summary order that they
don’t have jurisdiction over Yousef’s appeal and that it belongs
in federal court in Colorado.  Prisoners housed at the Florence prison include Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, an alleged al-Qaeda leader convicted of stabbing a
jail guard in New York; Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber; and
Terry Nichols, convicted in the 1995  Oklahoma City bombing .  The cases are U.S. v. Yousef, 93-cr-180, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ); and 11-3920,
 U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
