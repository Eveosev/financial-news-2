Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  has waived a
restriction that prohibited Japan’s  NEC Corp. (6701)  from selling 281.1
million of the Chinese company’s shares, according to a
statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange yesterday.  Lenovo issued the shares to NEC in exchange for a 51
percent stake in a joint-venture between the two companies. The
shares were subject to a so-called lock-up restriction that
prohibited NEC from selling them until two years after the deal
closed on July 1, 2011, according to the statement.  The shares are worth HK$1.86 billion ($240 million) at
Lenovo’s closing price of HK$6.62 yesterday. The Hong Kong
Economic Journal yesterday reported that NEC is seeking to sell
the entire stake at a discount of as much as 4.8 percent to the
closing price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
