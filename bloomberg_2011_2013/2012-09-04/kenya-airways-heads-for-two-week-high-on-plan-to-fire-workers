Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, headed for its strongest close
in almost two weeks following a court ruling the company can cut
jobs, a move that may slash costs.  The stock climbed as much as 3.9 percent and was trading
0.8 percent stronger at 13.10 shillings by 2:08 p.m. in Nairobi,
the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A close at
that level would be the highest since Aug. 22.  The company can move forward with plans to axe at least 650
jobs after  Kenya ’s Industrial Court lifted an injunction
stopping the cuts, the Nairobi-based Nation newspaper reported
on Aug. 31. Workers are contesting the decision.  “The costs will go down if they are laying off staff,
which could make the company a more attractive investment
opportunity,” Mbuthia Irungu, an equity trader with Renaissance
Capital Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
