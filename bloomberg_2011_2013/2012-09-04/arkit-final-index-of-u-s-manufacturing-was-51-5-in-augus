The Markit Economics final  index  of
U.S. manufacturing was little changed at 51.5 in August from
51.4 a month earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 indicates expansion. The final figure
compares with an initial August reading of 51.9.  Markitâ€™s purchasers figure is based on replies from about
85 percent to 90 percent of those American manufacturers who
respond to the poll of the more than 600 companies surveyed.  The gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May. The company
surveys purchasing managers in more than 30 countries and
regions, including Europe and  China .  In the euro-area, manufacturing contracted more than
initially estimated in August, suggesting the economy may
struggle to avoid a recession in the third quarter.  The gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area based
on a survey of  purchasing managers  was revised lower to 45.1
from the reading of 45.3 estimated earlier, Markit said
yesterday. The index, which stood at 44 in July, has held for 13
months below 50, indicating contraction.  In China, manufacturing slowed further in August, surveys
of purchasing managers showed, with one gauge at the lowest
level since March 2009. A manufacturing PMI released yesterday
by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit was at 47.6, indicating the
fastest contraction in more than three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
