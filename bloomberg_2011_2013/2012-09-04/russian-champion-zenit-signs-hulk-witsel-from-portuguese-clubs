Russian soccer champion Zenit St.
Petersburg signed Brazilian striker Hulk and Belgian midfielder
Axel Witsel from Portuguese clubs on five-year contracts.  Zenit announced both acquisitions on its  website  late
yesterday without disclosing financial details. Hulk, 26, joins
Zenit after four seasons at Porto, where he won three Portuguese
league titles, three Portuguese Cups and the 2011 Europa League.  Zenit will pay as much as 60 million euros ($75.7 million)
for Hulk, Portuguese news agency Lusa cited his agent, Teodoro
Fonseca, as saying. Such a fee would make Hulk the second-most
expensive Brazilian player after Real Madrid paid 65 million
euros for Kaka in 2009, according to Infostrada Sports.  Zenit will pay Benfica 40 million euros for Witsel after
triggering a buyout clause in his contract, the Portuguese club
said in a  statement  last night on its website.  The 23-year-old Witsel, who’s played 30 times for the
Belgian national team, spent a season at Benfica after joining
from Standard Liege.  Both players were included in Zenit’s  25-man squad  for
Europe’s elite Champions League, where it will face AC Milan,
Malaga and Anderlecht in Group C.  To contact the reporter on this story:
