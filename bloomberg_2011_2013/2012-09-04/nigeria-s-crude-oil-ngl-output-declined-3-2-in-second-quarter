Nigeria ,  Africa ’s largest oil
producer, said crude output including condensates and natural
gas liquids dropped by 3.2 percent in the second quarter.  Production fell to 2.12 million barrels a day, or 193
million barrels, from 2.19 million barrels a day, or 199 million
barrels, a year earlier, the Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria 
said in an Aug. 29  report  on its website. It didn’t give a
reason for the drop in output. Total oil exports in the same
period declined 4 percent to 1.67 million barrels a day from
1.74 million.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation with more than 160
million people, depends on oil exports for more than 80 percent
of its revenue and 95 percent of foreign-exchange income. The
West African nation earned $196 billion from oil and gas sales
in the four years through 2010, according to the statistics
office. The price of  Brent crude  has climbed 8 percent this year
and was trading at $116.34 a barrel today on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in  London .  Total crude and condensate output in Nigeria reached a
record 2.7 million barrels a day, the state-owned  Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp.  said on Aug. 2 after security improved
in the southern oil-producing Niger River delta region.  Energy companies in Nigeria have stepped up production as
attacks on installations in the oil-rich Niger River delta
declined following a 2009 amnesty for militants in the region
fighting for a greater share of oil resources. Attacks by armed
groups in the Niger delta region, home to Nigeria’s oil and gas
industry, cut more than 28 percent of the country’s output from
2006 to 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  At least 90 percent of the country’s crude is pumped by
Royal Dutch Shell Plc,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , Chevron Corp., Total
SA and Eni SpA in joint ventures with the NNPC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
