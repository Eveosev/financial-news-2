RadioShack Corp. (RSH) , the electronics
retailer whose shares have plunged 74 percent this year, is
starting a no-contract wireless service with  Leap Wireless
International Inc. (LEAP) ’s Cricket Communications to spur sales.  Two phones from China’s Huawei Technologies Co. including
the Huawei Mercury Ice go on sale tomorrow with two more devices
available by the end of September, RadioShack and Leap Wireless
International Inc.’s Cricket said today in a statement.  RadioShack Chief Executive Officer Jim Gooch is working to
spur sales that have fallen in four of the past seven quarters.
Third-quarter sales may rise 0.9 percent to $1.04 billion, the
average of 16 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  RadioShack, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, advanced 4.1
percent to $2.53 at the close in New York. San Diego-based Leap
slipped 0.2 percent to $5.46.  To contact the reporter on this story:
