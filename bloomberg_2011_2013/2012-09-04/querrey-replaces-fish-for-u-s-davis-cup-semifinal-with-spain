Sam Querrey  was selected to join the
U.S. Davis Cup team for its semifinal against Spain, with Mardy Fish unable to participate because of health issues.  Querrey, 24, will be joined by John Isner and the Bryan
brothers, Mike and Bob, for the Sept. 14-16 matches in Gijon,
Spain, U.S. captain  Jim Courier  said today. Argentina plays the
Czech Republic in the other semifinal, in Buenos Aires.  With Rafael Nadal injured, Spain’s team will consist of
David Ferrer,  Nicolas Almagro , Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez,
team captain Alex Corretja announced, according to the Tennis
Channel.  “This is going to be just as tough, if not tougher, than
anything we’ve faced this season,” Courier said in an interview
with the network today.  Fish, who won a singles and doubles match for the U.S. in
first-round play against Switzerland in February, withdrew from
the U.S. Open yesterday prior to his fourth-round match against
top-seeded  Roger Federer  because of an undisclosed health issue.
Fish, 30, was sidelined for more than two months this year while
being treated for an accelerated heartbeat.  “Obviously, disappointed that Mardy’s body is not allowing
him to compete the way that he would like to,” Courier said.
“Hopefully, he’ll be back playing again soon this fall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
