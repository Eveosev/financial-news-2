Price cuts on everything from
iPhones to Folgers coffee show why investors in U.S. government
bonds anticipate low inflation for the next decade even as the
 Federal Reserve  considers injecting more cash into the economy.  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to
set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
has averaged 2.54 percent this year. That’s the lowest since
2001 for the measure, which gauges expectations for inflation
between 2017 and 2022. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
that 10-year government bonds will yield 1.76 percent by Dec.
31, down from 2.76 percent in 2011 and 3.19 percent in 2010.  Bond yields show investors expect that soaring gasoline and
corn prices will fail to spread throughout the  U.S. economy  amid
a slump in wages and unemployment at more than 8 percent since
the beginning of 2009. That’s giving the Fed scope to add to the
$2.3 trillion of  government securities  it has bought since 2008,
an option Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week is possible
amid “grave concern” about joblessness.  “The  bond market  doesn’t view inflation as a problem,”
Anthony Valeri, a market strategist in San Diego at LPL
Financial, which oversees $350 billion of assets, said Aug. 28
in a telephone interview. “The bond market still views
deflation as a greater risk to the economy for the next one to
maybe two years.”  Tumbling Yields  Treasuries due in  30 years , the securities most sensitive
to price rises, yield 2.69 percent after touching 2.44 percent
on July 26, the lowest ever. That compares with an average of
3.9 percent in 2011 and 4.43 percent in the last decade.  U.S.  government bonds  have gained 2.6 percent this year,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. That
compares with 3.8 percent for German bunds and U.K. gilts.
Australian securities have gained 5.7 percent.  Yields on the benchmark 10-year note fell 7.5 basis points,
the most in seven days, after Bernanke said on Aug. 31 in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that the labor market is a “grave
concern” and that the central bank “will provide additional
policy accommodation as needed.”  “The economic situation is obviously far from
satisfactory,” Bernanke said in his speech. “Unless the
economy begins to grow more quickly than it has recently, the
 unemployment rate  is likely to remain far above levels
consistent with maximum employment for some time.”  The 10-year yield rose three basis points to 1.58 percent
today. It earlier touched 1.54 percent, the lowest since Aug. 6.  ‘Constrained’ Budgets  Retailers are responding to sluggish economic growth by
cutting prices. Sales rose 0.8 percent in July from the previous
month, the biggest increase since February, government figures
showed Aug. 14. That followed three straight months of declines,
including a 0.7 percent drop in June, the most since May 2010.  “What we’re suffering through in the job market is
reverberating through the economy,” Adolfo Laurenti, deputy
chief economist in Chicago at Mesirow Financial Inc., which
oversees $61.7 billion, said in a telephone interview Aug. 27.
“These lackluster sales at many major retailers are really
reflecting the fact that budgets are still constrained.”  Average hourly earnings rose 1.7 percent in July from a
year earlier, the smallest increase since December 2010 and down
from a peak of 3.8 percent in June 2007, the latest Labor
Department data show. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index was
little changed at minus 47.3 in the week ended Aug. 26, from the
prior reading of 47.4 that was the weakest since January.  Price Cuts  J.M. Smucker Co., which owns the Folgers coffee brand,
lowered retail prices in May by about 6 percent as Arabica bean
prices fell. Orrville, Ohio-based Smucker sees lower coffee
costs for the remainder of the year, President and Chief
Operating Officer Vincent Byrd said Aug. 17.  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the world’s largest consumer-products
company, rolled back $400 million of the $3.5 billion in price
increases it made last year, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller
said Aug. 3 during a conference call. The move boosted
Cincinnati-based P&G’s U.S. market share of laundry detergents,
including category leader Tide, by 0.6 percent in July, he said.  Bentonville, Arkansas-based  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  cut its
price for Apple Inc.’s 16 gigabyte iPhone 4S to $148 from $188,
which was already cheaper than the manufacturer’s suggested
retail price of $199. Second-quarter sales at Wal-Mart’s U.S.
stores open at least a year gained 2.2 percent, below the 2.6
percent in the previous quarter, the company said Aug. 16.  Wal-Mart Cuts  Wal-Mart cut prices on paper household products by 14.1
percent in August from a year earlier and health and beauty aids
by 13.7 percent, according to Bloomberg Industries data. The
cost of laundry goods has climbed 18 percent since September
2010 at the stores, while household paper items have increased
2.3 percent, the data show.  The company announced a program discounting gasoline by 15-
cents-per-gallon on Aug. 29. The average U.S. price of a gallon
of regular unleaded gasoline has risen 16 percent this year to
$3.80, according to AAA.  “Our customers are under pressure from the economy,”
Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising officer for the world’s
biggest retailer, said that day on a conference call. “We have
always had aggressive prices on gas. This takes it to the next
level.”  A measure of prices tied to  consumer spending  was the same
in July as in the previous month, according to an Aug. 30
Commerce Department report. The core personal consumption
expenditure deflator, which excludes food and energy costs, rose
1.6 from a year earlier, down from 2.2 percent in March.  Price Index  The  consumer price index  was unchanged for a second month
in July after plunging 0.3 percent in May, the most since
December 2008, according to the Labor department.  The Fed’s preferred long-term gauge of the bond market’s
expectations for inflation, the five-year, five-year rate, is
down from 2.78 percent in March and has averaged 2.74 percent
during Bernanke’s tenure since February 2006. That compares with
an average of 2.67 percent between 2000 and 2010.  There is concern that flooding the financial system with
cash will eventually spark runaway inflation as the $1.48
trillion in  excess reserves  held by U.S. banks feeds back into
the financial system.  Commercial and industrial  loans  at banks have risen to
$1.46 trillion from a post-crisis low of $1.2 trillion in 2010,
according to the Fed. The peak was $1.61 trillion in 2008.  ‘A Conflagration’  “All of the monetary policy is like filling your house
basement with gas and hoping it won’t catch on fire,” Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners LLC,
said Aug. 24 in a telephone interview. “All it needs is a spark
and it will be a conflagration,” said Minerd, whose firm
oversees more than $125 billion from Santa Monica, California.  The Republican Party platform adopted at its national
convention calls for a commission to investigate a possible
“metallic basis for U.S. currency.”  The move was driven by supporters of Representative  Ron
Paul  of Texas, who has long criticized the Fed’s control of the
 money supply  and wants to revive the link between gold and the
dollar to preserve the currency’s value.  President Barack Obama will accept the  Democratic Party ’s
nomination for reelection this week at their convention in
Charlotte, North Carolina. Lower inflation and bond yields have
helped his administration finance a fourth-straight deficit
exceeding $1 trillion.  Interest Burden  The Congressional Budget Office forecasts interest on
 government debt  will equal 1.4 percent of  gross domestic product 
this fiscal year, less than the 3.1 percent when Democrat  Bill
Clinton  ran for re-election in 1996 and 3.2 percent when
Republican  George H.W. Bush  ran in 1992.  Investors remain bullish on bonds, in part, because wages
are stagnating even though commodities prices have risen.  Food price inflation caused by the worsening U.S. drought,
as well as higher gasoline prices, is being offset by employment
and wages that have failed to recover sufficiently, Valeri said.  Corn has surged 57 percent since June 15, reaching a record
$8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10, as the drought parched millions of
acres across the U.S. Soybeans gained 33 percent since mid-June
and reached a record $17.605 a bushel on Aug. 27. Oil touched a
15-week high of $98.29 on Aug. 23, and gained 20.9 percent on
Aug. 31 to $96.47, as Tropical Storm Isaac strengthened,
crimping output in the  Gulf of Mexico .  “The real driver of inflation is labor costs, how much
people are making,”  LPL Financial ’s Valeri said. “Salaries
aren’t increasing much at all.” Valeri said he favors
intermediate-maturity corporate bonds because “ interest rates 
are going to stay low for a while.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
