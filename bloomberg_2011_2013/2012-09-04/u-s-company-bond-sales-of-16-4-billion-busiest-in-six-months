Corporate issuers led by  Deere (DE)  & Co.
and  Honda (HMC)  Motor Co. offered the most dollar-denominated debt
today in almost six months after yields on U.S. investment-grade
bonds dropped to a record low.  Deere, the largest maker of agricultural equipment, and
Tokyo-based Honda led borrowers selling or planning to sell at
least $16.4 billion of bonds, the  most  since $26.9 billion on
March 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales this
year have averaged $5.7 billion per day while August issuance,
the busiest on record for the month, averaged $5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
