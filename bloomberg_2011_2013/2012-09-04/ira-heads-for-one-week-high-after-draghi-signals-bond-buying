Turkey  bond yields  dropped the most
in more than a week after the central bank reiterated it expects
inflation to slow in the fourth quarter.  Yields on benchmark two-year debt fell 12 basis points, or
0.12 percentage point, to 7.63 percent at the close in Istanbul,
the most since Aug. 27, after rising 13 basis points yesterday.
The lira strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 1.8173 per dollar
after dropping 1.3 percent last month.  Yields yesterday rose the most in almost a month after the
inflation rate declined less than expected to 8.9 percent in
August from 9.1 percent in July as food and transport prices
rose. The median estimate of five economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 8.3 percent. The fall in inflation rate is
expected to gather pace in the fourth quarter, the bank said in
an e-mailed statement today.  “The central bank’s priority is inflation even though it
says growth will slow,” Bugra Bilgi, a hedge fund manager at
Garanti Asset Management in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments
today.  The bank’s core measure of price growth which excludes food
and non-alcoholic beverages declined to 7.2 percent in August
from 7.5 percent a month earlier.  “Inflation is falling and sub-indices are performing well
and the central bank can cut rates,” Bilgi said.  The bank provided 2 billion liras ($1.09 billion) at its
lowest 5.75 percent funding rate in the one-week repurchase
agreements auction today, the same amount of funding last week.
The  overnight cost of borrowing  in the  interbank market  fell for
a second day to 5.11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
