Indonesia ’s East Kalimantan Governor
Awang Faroek Ishak is considering limiting annual coal output
from the region to 150 million metric tons to preserve the
resource and spur the development of alternative energy.  The province, the country’s top coal producer, is expected
to produce 220 million tons of power-station coal this year,
Ishak told reporters at the Kalimantan Coal Conference in
Balikpapan today.  Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal and
a producer of resources including tin, nickel and bauxite, is
trying to control mining production aimed at limiting
environmental damage in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy. The
country banned exports of some mineral-ores starting in May, two
years ahead of schedule, after exports surged.  “If we continue massive production, they will decline
faster,” Ishak said, referring to the province’s coal reserves.
The limitation “aims at extending mine life and we can use new
and renewable energy,” he said.  Indonesian coal output in 2012 may be unchanged from a year
earlier at 360 million tons, down from a previous forecast of
390 million tons, as its smallest miners cut back,  Bob Kamandanu , chairman of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association,
said June 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
