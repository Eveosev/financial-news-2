A French court will decide Oct. 2 on
a buyer for  Petroplus Holdings AG ’s Petit-Couronne refinery, one
of five European plants affected by the company’s insolvency.  Two offers, from  Netoil Inc.  and  Alafandi Petroleum Group ,
are being examined by the court in Rouen, Petroplus said today
in a statement. The bidders have yet to submit proof of their
financial and technical eligibility to run the plant in
Normandy, according to the Zug, Switzerland-based company.  Petroplus, once  Europe ’s largest independent oil refiner,
sought buyers for its plants in the region after filing for
insolvency in January. Three facilities have been sold to
trading companies that will keep the sites running, while a
fourth, at Coryton in the U.K., will be converted to storage.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , previous owner of Petit-Couronne,
has operated the refinery since June under a six-month tolling
arrangement whereby it supplies crude and takes ownership of the
products. Unions fighting to keep the plant running organized a
demonstration at the courthouse today, according to a statement
from the Confederation Generale du Travail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
