What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
lower on speculation that dry, warm weather during the next week
will increase harvesting and farmer sales of U.S. crops, Alan Brugler, the president of Brugler Marketing & Managements Inc.
in Omaha,  Nebraska , said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
speculation that record prices for the oilseed and soybean meal
may slow demand for supplies from the U.S., where harvesting is
beginning, Brugler said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to down 2 cents a bushel as
lower corn prices might slow demand for the higher-priced grain
in  animal feed , Brugler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
