Central banks will increase gold
purchases to 493 metric tons this year as they keep expanding
reserves to diversify from the dollar and guard against a
potential gain in inflation, Thomson Reuters GFMS said.  The banks bought 273 tons in the first half, 34 percent
more than a year earlier, and will purchase 220 tons in the
current half to raise the full-year total by 7.9 percent, the
London-based  researcher  said today in a report. They bought 457
tons last year, GFMS said. Gross first-half purchases rose to
278 tons as sales slid 83 percent from a year earlier to 5 tons.  “We expect the official sector to remain a significant
gold buyer for some time to come,” GFMS said. “Although we
expect to see continued purchases, a more aggressive scale of
acquisitions than current levels is highly unlikely due to the
limited size of the gold market, particularly when compared with
some countries’ foreign-exchange holdings.”  Bullion lending by central banks has remained “broadly
flat” after the first increase in more than a decade last year,
the researcher said. There was growth in “very short-term”
lending from certain central banks to earn extra yields as well
as to avoid storage charges, said GFMS, a unit of  Thomson
Reuters  Corp.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
financial and legal information and trading systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
