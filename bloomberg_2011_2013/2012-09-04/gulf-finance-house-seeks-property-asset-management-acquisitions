Gulf Finance House EC (GFH) , the Bahraini
investment bank that in July reached a deal to restructure debt,
said it’s looking to make acquisitions in asset management and
real estate and boost its stake in current holdings.  Gulf Finance is conducting due diligence on the possible
acquisitions, the Manama-based company said in a statement
today, without elaborating. The regulatory filing was made in
response to a Sept. 2 newspaper report that quoted acting Chief
Executive Officer Hisham al-Rayes, the company said.  Gulf Finance subsidiary G Capital is in talks “with
various prospective partners” to start a second technology fund
after the first one was “very successful,” Gulf Finance said.
Dubai-based G Capital and a partner last year won a bid to buy
Adabank AS of  Turkey  for $75 million. The full acquisition “can
only happen after all the formalities of the Turkish regulator
have been completed,” Gulf Finance said today.  The company said in July it reached an agreement to
restructure an Islamic syndicate facility whereby it will pay
$45 million of a $100-million Wakala facility over six years.
Gulf Finance operates in  venture capital , private equity,
investment banking and asset management, as well as investing in
infrastructure projects in the  Middle East  and North Africa,
according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
