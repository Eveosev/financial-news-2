U.K. stocks  fell to their lowest in
a month, led by a selloff in mining companies, as a U.S.
manufacturing report added to concern the recovery in the
world’s largest economy is slowing.  Rio Tinto  Group retreated 2.6 percent as  iron ore  traded
near a three-year low.  Xstrata (XTA)  Plc, the target of a $33 billion
takeover bid by  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , declined 3.1
percent.  Land Securities (LAND)  Group Ltd. and British Land Co. both
slipped at least 2 percent.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index slid 86.4 points, or 1.5 percent, to
5,672.01 at the close in London, its lowest level since Aug 2.
The gauge has still  gained 7.8 percent from this year’s low  on
June 1 boosted by speculation central banks will add stimulus to
drive growth. The FTSE All-Share Index lost 1.4 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell 0.5 percent.  Today’s “data has forced traders to focus back on the real
economy and the signs are still not encouraging,” said  David
Jones , chief market strategist at IG Index in London. “The
moves today could well be the sign of the market returning to
its more volatile and slightly nervous pre-summer state.”  Manufacturing in the U.S. has contracted for three months,
the longest slide since the recession ended. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s  factory index  fell to 49.6 in August, the
lowest since July 2009, from 49.8 in July.  Economists in a
 Bloomberg survey  had forecast a reading of 50, the dividing line
between expansion and contraction.  Investors are waiting for European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  to speak on Sept. 6. The leaders of the single
currency’s biggest economies hold further meetings before then
as they brace for the ECB’s plan to defend the euro from bond-
market turmoil.  Mining Companies  Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest mining company,
dropped 2.6 percent to 2,722 pence, while  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BLT) , the
biggest, lost 1.5 percent to 1,827 pence. Iron ore slipped on
concern that slowing growth in China, the world’s largest buyer,
will curb demand for the steel-making ingredient.  Xstrata fell 3.1 percent to 917.5 pence, sliding for a
second day. Shareholders will reject the company’s merger with
Glencore on Sept. 7, according to analysts. Qatar Holdings LLC,
which owns about 12 percent of Xstrata, last week said that it
will vote against the offer.  Glencore slipped 0.8 percent to 385.1 pence.  Real Estate  Land Securities lost 2 percent to 777.5 pence after
analysts from UBS AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Exane BNP Paribas
all downgraded the U.K.’s largest real estate investment trust
to neutral.  “The real estate sector is looking less attractive after a
strong performance,” Nick Webb, an analyst at Exane in London
wrote in a report to clients. “The scope for further
performance through re-rating alone seems limited.”  UBS also lowered its recommendation for  British Land (BLND)  to
neutral. The U.K.’s second-biggest real estate investment trust
fell 2.7 percent to 527 pence after announcing it will sell as
much as 400 million pounds ($635 million) of convertible bonds.  The securities, due in 2017, can be exchanged for stock
when the shares rise 27.5 percent to 32.5 percent from their
current price.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  declined 2.6 percent to 178.45 pence
after Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. downgraded the mobile-phone
company to market perform from outperform and cut its share
price estimate by 21 percent to 170 pence. Analysts cited
regulatory changes in the telecommunications industry and
heightened operational risks.  Next, Ashtead  Next Plc (NXT)  lost 2 percent to 3,571 pence after Exane
downgraded the U.K.’s second-largest clothing retailer to
underperform, the equivalent of a sell recommendation, from
neutral. The brokerage said strong trading for the rest of the
year was now priced into the shares.  Ashtead Group Plc (AHT)  surged 12 percent to 315.9 pence, its
highest price since at least 1989, after the construction-
equipment rental company said full-year earnings will be
“materially better” than it had  forecast . Ashtead reported a
76 percent jump in underlying pretax profit in the three months
ended July 31 to 61.4 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
