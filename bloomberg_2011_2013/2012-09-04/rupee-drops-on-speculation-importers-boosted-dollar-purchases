India’s rupee fell, erasing earlier
gains, on speculation importers stepped up dollar purchases to
benefit from the best exchange-rate in more than a week.  The currency had strengthened as much as 0.3 percent
earlier as investors expect the  European Central Bank  to
announce details of a new bond-purchase plan this week, spurring
fund flows into  emerging markets . ECB President  Mario Draghi 
said in Brussels he would be comfortable buying bonds with
maturities of up to about three years, Jean-Paul Gauzes, a
member of the European Parliament, said yesterday. Policy makers
at the ECB are scheduled to meet Sept. 6.  “Since the U.S. was shut yesterday for a holiday, there
were limited dollar supplies,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a
trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “All the bids
I saw today were from oil and gold importers.”  The rupee declined 0.2 percent to 55.6625 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
55.3750 earlier, the strongest level since Aug. 24. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, fell 30 basis points, or 0.30 percentage point,
to 9.50 percent, the lowest level since May 2.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.64 per
dollar, compared with 56.55 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.55 from 56.41. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
