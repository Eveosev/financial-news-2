Hitachi Zosen Corp. (7004) , an industrial
machinery maker, is leading a group including  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and
 JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  that plans to build 120 billion yen ($1.5
billion) of offshore wind farms in  Japan .  The seven-member group will complete 7.5 megawatts of pilot
plants by 2016 before building the wind farms with a combined
capacity of 300 megawatts over 10 years, Tomomitsu Yamamoto,
Hitachi Zosen’s Tokyo-based spokesman, said today by telephone.  Last year’s Fukushima disaster caused by an earthquake and
tsunami prompted the government to reduce reliance on nuclear
energy in favor of natural gas and renewable sources. Japanese
power utilities are obliged to buy electricity from solar and
wind projects at above-market rates.  The Japan Weather Association,  Sumitomo Electric Industries
Ltd. (5802) , Toa Corp. and Toyo Construction Co. are other members of
the group, Hitachi Zosen said today in a statement on its
website. The group may form a special purpose company and seek
funds for the project, according to the statement.  Japan’s government introduced incentives in July to promote
investments in clean energy. The program’s feed-in tariff for
wind is 23.1 yen per kilowatt-hour for 20 years, almost double
the market rate for industrial users.  The Nikkei newspaper today reported the offshore wind power
project, without saying where it obtained the information.  Hitachi Zosen rose as much as 3.5 percent and gained 1.2
percent to 88 yen as of 12:35 p.m. in  Tokyo . JFE Holdings
climbed 2.4 percent to 1,008 yen. Toshiba was unchanged at 249
yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
