Global coffee production for the
season ending this month will be higher than first estimated as
output expands in  Vietnam , the biggest grower of robusta beans,
according to the  International Coffee Organization .  World production will total 132.7 million bags for the
2011-12 season, the London-based group said in a report e-mailed
today. That compares with last month’s 131.4 million-bag
forecast and 134.3 million bags a year earlier.  “This revision is mostly attributable to better-than-
expected levels of production in Vietnam, which is now estimated
at 21 million bags, up 7.9 percent,” the ICO said. Each bag
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Production of robusta, used in instant coffee and espresso,
will rise to 51.5 million bags from 49 million bags a year
earlier, the ICO estimated. That will boost the variety’s share
of global output to almost 39 percent from 36.5 percent a year
earlier, according to the report.  Coffee consumption expanded 0.5 percent to 137.9 million
bags last year, below the 10-year average of 2.3 percent, ICO
data showed. Consumption in importing countries dropped 0.7
percent, with U.K. usage falling as much as 6.7 percent. Demand
gained 3.3 percent in producing nations and slid 2 percent in
 emerging markets , according to ICO figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
