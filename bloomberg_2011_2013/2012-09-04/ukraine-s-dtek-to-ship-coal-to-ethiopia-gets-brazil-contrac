DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private coal
and power producer, secured contracts to ship coal to Brazil and
 Ethiopia  this year.  DTEK will supply 50,000 tons of anthracite to South
American ports by the year end for iron and steel plants
belonging to  Gerdau S.A. (GGBR4) , said the company in a statement on the
regulatory news wire today. DTEK, based in the capital Kiev,
will also deliver coal this year to a cement plant owned by
Ethiopian Petroleum Enterprise in Ethiopia.  DTEK is seeking to increase its presence in foreign markets
and already sells coal in Turkey, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania.  “The export potential to the African market is at least
300,000 tons of anthracite coal,” said Andrey Favorov, the
commercial director for DTEK, said in the statement. “There is
a considerable demand for high quality anthracite coal” in
Africa and  South America , he said.  South America can import more than 1.2 million metric tons
of anthracite a year, Favorov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
