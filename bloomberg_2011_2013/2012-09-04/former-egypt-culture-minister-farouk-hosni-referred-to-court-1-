Former Egyptian Culture Minister
Farouk Hosni has been referred to criminal court on charges of
profiteering, the Justice Ministry said in a faxed statement
today.  Hosni is required to repay 9 million Egyptian pounds ($1.47
million) that he allegedly gained unlawfully during his years as
minister under ousted President  Hosni Mubarak , the statement
said.  Hosni hasnâ€™t received any requests from the court yet and
his wealth derives from legal sources, a spokesman said by
telephone from Cairo today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
