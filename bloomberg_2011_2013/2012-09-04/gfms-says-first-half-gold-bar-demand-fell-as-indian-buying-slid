Gold bar demand dropped 14 percent
in the first half as Indian purchases slipped to the lowest in
three years,  Thomson Reuters  GFMS said.  Global bar investment declined to 504 metric tons in the
six months through June from 587 tons a year earlier, the
London-based  researcher  said today in a report. Indian purchases
slid almost 60 percent in the period to 75 tons, the lowest
amount since the first half of 2009, it said.  Indian demand declined because of a more volatile rupee,
slowing economic growth, a higher cost of capital and concern
about below-average monsoon rains, GFMS said. Global bar demand
may be 513 tons in the second half, 16 percent lower than a year
earlier, said the researcher, a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
