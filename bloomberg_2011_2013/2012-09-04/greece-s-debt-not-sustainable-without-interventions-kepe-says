Greece ’s public debt is on a non-
sustainable path even after a restructuring earlier this year,
the nation’s  Center of Planning and Economic Research  said.  The country will not be able to cut its debt to 120 percent
of gross domestic product by 2020, as required under a bailout
from the European Union and  International Monetary Fund , without
“targeted policy interventions,” the state-run researcher,
known as KEPE, said in a report today.  Such interventions include spreading out an 11.6 billion-
euro ($14.6 billion) package of spending cuts, currently being
finalized by the government, over four years instead of two, a
reduction in the country’s interest rates and a “realistic”
state asset-sales program, KEPE said. Without these changes the
debt in 2020 could be as high as 151 percent of GDP, the center
said.  Greece earlier this year reduced its debt load by about 100
billion euros, the biggest restructuring in history, after
private-sector creditors agreed to write down the value of the
government bond holdings. The government needs approval of its
spending package by euro-area governments and the IMF to receive
more funds under its 240 billion euros of bailout loans.  To contact the reporters on this story:
