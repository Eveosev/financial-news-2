Eastern Water Resources Development
and Management Pcl (EASTW) , Thailand’s biggest private water provider,
rose to a record in Bangkok trading on infrastructure expansion
plans and a forecast for growth in water demand from producers.  The shares  climbed  2.6 percent to 11.8 baht at the close,
the highest level since it listed on the stock exchange in 1997.
The benchmark  SET Index (SET)  in comparison rose 0.1 percent.  The Bangkok-based water company, controlled by state-owned
Provincial Waterworks Authority, plans to spend 4.1 billion baht
($131 million) through 2016 to expand water reserves and
pipelines, Executive Vice President Jaroensuk Worapansopak said
today at a meeting with investors in Bangkok.  Eastern Water is benefiting from an increase in industrial
activity in eastern Rayong province, where  General Motors Co. (GM) 
and  Ford Motor Co. (F)  have plants, after some production shifted
there when factories in Thailand’s central region were damaged
by flooding, according to Jaroensuk.  Manufacturers’ demand for its raw water is projected to
grow 8.4 percent in 2012 and 6.7 percent in 2013, he said.  Eastern Water shares have surged 90 percent this year
compared with an 21 percent increase in the SET Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
