PinguinLutosa NV (PIN) , the Belgian
producer of frozen vegetables, rose the most in almost three
years in Brussels trading after saying it received unsolicited
non-binding offers for its potato division.  The shares climbed as much as 91 cents, or 11 percent, to
8.90 euros, the biggest intraday percentage increase since Aug.
10, 2009. The stock, up 19 percent this year, traded at 8.90
euros at 10:53 a.m. local time, valuing the company at 146.5
million euros. PinguinLutosa bought the potato business in 2007
for 175 million euros in cash.  PinguinLutosa’s board and management will “carefully”
consider the offers, exploring the merits and risks for
stakeholders, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.
Further announcements will be made if and when appropriate,
PinguinLutosa said.  Dutch potato group  Aviko  is one of several companies
interested in buying the potato business,  De Standaard reported 
today, citing PinguinLutosa Chairman Luc Van Nevel. The company
will make a decision at its next board meeting, according to the
newspaper. No one in Aviko’s press office was available to
immediately comment.  “A sale of the potato division of PinguinLutosa would be a
major game changer,”  Pascale Weber , an analyst at KBC
Securities in Brussels who recommends investors accumulate the
stock, wrote in a note to clients today. “Only a sufficiently
high bid would justify such a change.”  PinguinLutosa is the fifth-biggest in the industry, with
the top three players being McCain Foods Ltd., Lamb Weston and
Aviko, Weber wrote in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
