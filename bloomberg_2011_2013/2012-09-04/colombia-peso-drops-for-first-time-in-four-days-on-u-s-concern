Colombia’s peso dropped for the
first time in four days as concern the  U.S. economy  is slowing
hurt demand for higher-yielding emerging market assets.  The peso depreciated 0.2 percent to 1,824.53 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:26 a.m. in Bogota, paring this year’s rally to 6.2
percent, still the best performance after the Hungarian forint
and Chilean peso among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Colombia’s currency fell in line with Latin American
counterparts as a U.S. manufacturing report fueled concern
global growth is stalling, said William Florez, an analyst at
Helm Bank SA’s brokerage unit in Bogota.  “Those international figures haven’t been very good,” he
said in a telephone interview. “The peso is seeing a small drop
influenced by that external context.”  The peso dropped 0.6 percent last week as the central bank
and the Treasury bought dollars to help Colombian exporters by
stemming the local currency’s gain.  Global stocks fell today as reports showed U.S.
manufacturing contracted for a third straight month in August
while  China ’s shrank at the fastest pace since 2009.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 was little changed at 6.62 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
