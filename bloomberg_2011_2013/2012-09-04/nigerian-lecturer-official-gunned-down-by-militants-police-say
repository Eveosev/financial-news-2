Suspected Islamist militants killed
a university lecturer and a local government secretary in the
northeastern city of Maiduguri yesterday, police said.  Suspected members of the Boko Haram group shot the two men
dead in the capital of Borno state, Abdullahi Yuguda, the state
police chief, told reporters today at the scene of the incident.  Boko Haram, which says it is campaigning to establish an
Islamic state in  Africa â€™s top oil producer, has carried out bomb
and gun attacks targeting government buildings, security forces
and churches in the mainly Muslim north and Abuja, the capital,
in the past two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
