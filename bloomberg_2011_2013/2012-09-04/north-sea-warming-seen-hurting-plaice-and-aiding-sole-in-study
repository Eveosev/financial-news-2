Warming of the  North Sea  is driving
out plaice, one of the main commercial fish species in the
region, while improving conditions for sole, research by the
Netherlands’ Wageningen University showed.  Researchers at its Imares marine-science unit linked fish
physiology with environmental data to create habitat maps that
can be used to predict how changes affect populations of plaice
and sole, the university wrote in a  statement  on its website
today. They worked with the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea
Research, according to Wageningen.  “The maps show that the rising temperature of the sea
water can improve the growth of sole,” the university wrote.
“Young plaice, however, fare less well in warmer sea water.”  The sea’s southern coasts are warming, which may explain
why juvenile plaice are migrating away from those areas,
according to the university. Sole is a more southern species and
has greater resilience to temperature increases, it said.  The research team will now study North Sea herring and
whiting, the university wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
