The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities slipped 0.4 percent to 672.55 at 4:32 p.m. in  New
York  as oil, sugar and cotton futures fell. The UBS Bloomberg
CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials dropped 0.3 percent to 1604.097.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cotton futures fell the most in more than a week as
improved crop prospects in  India , the world’s second-largest
exporter, add to the global supply outlook.  Orange juice  rose.  India’s biggest-growing areas will get rain until Sept. 10
as a revival in the monsoon eases drought conditions and boosts
plants, the country’s Meteorological Department said today. The
fiber, down 18 percent in 2012, may extend its slump as the
global surplus rises in the year started Aug. 1, according to
the average of 20 analyst and merchant estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  Cotton for December delivery tumbled 2 percent to settle at
75.68 cents a pound at 2:45 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest decline since Aug. 24.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery increased 1.8
percent to $1.2115 a pound on ICE. The price rose for the fifth
straight session, the longest rally in six months.  Also in New York, raw sugar futures for October delivery
dropped 2.2 percent to 19.34 cents a pound on ICE.  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to
close at $1.653 a pound on signs of limited supply from  Brazil ,
the world’s largest producer. Farmers in Brazil are hoarding
part of their production to wait for price increases, the
National Coffee Council said in a report last week.  Cocoa futures for December delivery slumped 2.3 percent to
$2,551 a metric ton in New York.  Soft  commodities markets : NI SOMKTS  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell as U.S. and euro-area manufacturing contracted in
August, raising concern that slower economic growth will reduce
demand.  Prices dropped 1.2 percent after the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s U.S. factory index declined more than analysts
forecast. Manufacturing slipped more than initially estimated in
the euro area, London-based Markit Economics reported yesterday.  Oil for October delivery decreased $1.17 to settle at
$95.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are
down 3.6 percent this year.  The U.S. manufacturing index decreased to 49.6 in August
from 49.8 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based ISM said
today. Economists in a Bloomberg survey projected an August
reading of 50, which is the dividing line between expansion and
contraction.  Oil markets: NI OILMARKET  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline and heating oil futures fell as U.S. Gulf Coast
refineries came back online after Hurricane Isaac, boosting
supply, and the contraction in U.S. manufacturing indicated oil
demand may shrink.  Futures sank after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  and Phillips 66
started three refineries, the last three plants remaining shut
because of Hurricane Isaac.  October-delivery gasoline fell 2.06 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $2.9522 a gallon on the Nymex. Prices climbed 6.6
percent last month.  Futures touched $3.0032 a gallon earlier on speculation the
refinery outages would persist, reducing fuel supplies. Gasoline
inventories probably declined 3 million barrels last week, the
median of nine estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Heating oil for October delivery fell 3.34 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $3.1468 a gallon on the exchange. Futures
gained 12 percent in August, the biggest monthly rise since
September 2010.  Gasoline: NI GASOLINE

Oil Products Europe: NI OPEMKT  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures climbed for a fourth day in New York,
the longest winning streak since July 24, on speculation that a
government report this week will show a smaller-than-normal
stockpile increase.  Gas gained 2 percent. The report, scheduled for release
Sept. 6, may show stockpiles rose 38 billion cubic feet in the
week ended Aug. 31, according to  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at
Citi Futures Perspective in New York. The five-year average
change is a gain of 60 billion. A surplus to average supplies
has been declining since March.  Natural gas for October delivery rose 5.5 cents to settle
at $2.854 per million British thermal units on the Nymex. The
futures have climbed 9.2 percent from a two-month low of $2.614
on Aug. 28.  Gas inventories totaled 3.374 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Aug. 24, 12 percent above the five-year average, the
Energy Department said Aug. 30 in a weekly stockpile report. The
supply surplus over the five-year average has shrunk since
reaching a six-year high of 61 percent on March 30.  Gas market: NI GASMARKET

European natural gas: NI EGASMARKET  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures topped $1,700 an ounce for the first time
since March on speculation that a sluggish global economy will
spur central bankers to boost monetary stimulus, increasing
demand for the metal as an inflation hedge.  ISM’s U.S. factory index showed contraction for the third
straight month, and manufacturing in the euro area shrank more
than estimated, suggesting the region’s economy may struggle to
avoid a recession in the third quarter. Last month, gold’s
jumped 4.5 percent, the most since January.  Gold futures for December delivery gained 0.5 percent from
Aug. 31 to settle at $1,696 at 1:36 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,701.60, the highest for a
most-active contract since March 13. Floor trading was closed
yesterday for a U.S. holiday.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 3.1 percent to
$32.411 an ounce on the Comex, after reaching $32.435, the
highest since April 13.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery advanced 2 percent to $1,567.50 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery gained 1.9 percent to
$641.45 an ounce.  Precious metal markets: NI PCMKTS  BASE METALS  Copper fell for the first time in three sessions in  London 
on ISM’s manufacturing report, which added to signs of a global
economic slowdown that threatens metal demand.  In  China , manufacturing last month contracted at the
fastest pace since March 2009, a private survey showed
yesterday.  Copper for delivery in three months slipped 0.6 percent to
settle at $7,635 a metric ton ($3.46 a pound) at 5:50 p.m. on
the London Metal Exchange. The metal gained 1.5 percent in the
previous two sessions.  In New York, copper futures for December delivery rose 0.3
percent from Aug. 31 to close at $3.469 a pound on the Comex.
Floor trading was closed yesterday for a U.S. holiday.  In London, zinc and aluminum rose, while tin, lead and
nickel fell.  Base metals markets: NI BMMKTS  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat futures fell for the eighth time in nine sessions on
speculation that cooler weather and rain in the U.S. southern
Great Plains will boost soil moisture and allow farmers to seed
winter varieties starting this month.  As much as 2 inches (5.1 centimeters) of rain may fall in
parts of central and eastern  Kansas  in the next five days,
Commodity Weather Group said. Temperatures will be lower on
average in the next 10 days, the Bethesda, Maryland-based
forecaster said. Little or no rain fell in the past week in
Kansas, National Weather Service data show.  Wheat futures for December delivery slid 0.1 percent to
settle at $8.8875 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. Prices are up 36 percent this year after the worst U.S.
drought since 1956 parched fields and eroded planting prospects.  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 0.7 percent to
$17.6825 a bushel at 2 p.m. in Chicago after reaching a record
$17.89 on signs that the U.S. drought has cut production more
than the government forecast last month.  Soybean production may fall 15 percent to 2.602 billion
bushels from a year earlier, Allendale Inc., a researcher and
broker, said today after surveying farmers. That compares with
the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s estimate of 2.692 billion
on Aug. 10. Corn output will total 10.326 billion bushels,
trailing the USDA’s forecast of 10.779 billion, according to
Allendale. Both crops will be the smallest since 2003.  Soybean-meal futures for December delivery closed unchanged
at $533.40 per 2,000 pounds in Chicago, after surging to an all-
time high of $541.80.  Corn futures for December delivery climbed 0.7 percent to
$8.05 a bushel on the CBOT. The most-active contract touched a
record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Grain markets: NI GRMKTS  LIVESTOCK  Cattle prices advanced to the highest in more than two
weeks on signs of increasing U.S. beef demand. Hog futures were
little changed.  Wholesale beef climbed 0.5 percent to $1.9057 a pound at
midday, snapping a six-session slump, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. In August, the price rose 6.6 percent,
the most since February. Meat sales probably rose before the
U.S. holiday weekend that ended yesterday as more people grilled
outdoors.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.1 percent to
settle at $1.26175 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1.26325, the highest for
the most-active contract since Aug. 16. The commodity is up 3.9
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement advanced 0.2
percent to $1.4695 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement rose less than 0.1
percent to 74.2 cents a pound after dropping as much as 1.2
percent. The price has declined 12 percent this year.  Livestock markets: NI LVMKTS  To contact the reporter on this story:
