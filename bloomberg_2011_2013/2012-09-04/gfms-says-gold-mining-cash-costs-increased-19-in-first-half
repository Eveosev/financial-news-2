Gold producers’ average total cash
costs jumped 19 percent to a record $727 an ounce in the first
half as output was little changed,  Thomson Reuters  GFMS said.  The average cash margin dropped to $872 an ounce in the
second quarter from as much as $1,032 an ounce in last year’s
third quarter, as the average all-in cost of production climbed
to $1,050 in the first half, the London-based  researcher  said
today in a report. Output rose 0.1 percent to 1,366 metric tons
in the first half from a year earlier and second-half supply
will rise 1.7 percent year-on-year to 1,482 tons, GFMS said.  The average grade of ore processed globally dropped 23
percent from 2005 through the end of last year and will probably
decline another 4 percent this year, GFMS estimated. Peru’s gold
output rose 6 percent to 97.2 tons in the first half, beating
 South Africa  and  Russia  as the fourth-biggest producer in the
period. Russia and South Africa were the fourth- and fifth-
biggest miners last year, after  China ,  Australia  and the U.S.,
according to GFMS.  Producers reduced gold hedges by 8 tons in the first half
and will cut forward sales by another 12 tons in the second
half, compared with 11 tons a year earlier, the researcher said.
Miners can sell future output at fixed prices to secure loans
and may cut hedges by buying back contracts, adding to demand.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
