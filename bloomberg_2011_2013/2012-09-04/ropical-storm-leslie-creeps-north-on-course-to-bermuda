Tropical Storm Leslie churned in the
Atlantic toward  Bermuda , where the  National Hurricane Center 
said the system may grow into a hurricane and brush the islands
later this week.  Leslie has winds of 65 miles (100 kilometers) per hour and
is moving north at 5 mph, according to a 5 a.m. Atlantic time
NHC  advisory . The storm was 545 miles southeast of Bermuda.  On its current  track , Leslie is expected to near the
western side of Bermuda this weekend with winds of 100 mph, the
hurricane center said. Leslie may stir storm surf from Bermuda
to the U.S. East Coast, it said.  “Large swells propagating away from the tropical cyclone
will affect Bermuda and nearly all of the U.S. East Coast for
much of the week,” John Cangialosi, a specialist for the Miami-
based center, said in a forecast analysis.  Leslie is the 12th storm of the  Atlantic hurricane season ,
which runs from June through November and has its statistical
peak on Sept. 10.  Last week, Hurricane Isaac struck  Louisiana  with high winds
and heavy rain, closing 95 percent of oil production and 73
percent of natural gas output in the  Gulf of Mexico .  Tropical Depression 13 was 1,450 miles northwest of the
Cape Verde Islands, the NHC also said. The system, with 35 mph
winds, is expected to strengthen into Tropical Storm Michael
without threatening land.  In the Pacific, Tropical Depression John, the 10th named
system of that ocean’s season, was expected to become a remnant
low today. John was 365 miles west of the southern tip of  Baja
California  with 35 mph winds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
