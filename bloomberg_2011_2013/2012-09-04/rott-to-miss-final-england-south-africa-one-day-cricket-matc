England batsman Jonathan Trott will
miss the final one-day cricket match against South Africa
tomorrow at  Trent Bridge  with a hand injury.  Trott will sit out after being hit in the right hand by a
ball bowled by  Dale Steyn  in England’s victory two days ago, the
England and Wales Cricket Board said in a statement. Jos Buttler
was yesterday called into the squad as cover.  England has won the past two games to take a 2-1 lead in
the five-match series and will retain the No. 1 spot in the
International Cricket Council’s one-day rankings until at least
January.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
