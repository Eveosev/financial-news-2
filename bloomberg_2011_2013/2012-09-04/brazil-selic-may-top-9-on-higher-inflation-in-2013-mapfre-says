Brazil ’s central bank is likely to
raise the benchmark Selic interest rate to 9 percent or more to
combat inflation that may exceed the country’s target ceiling in
2013, according to Mapfre DTVM SA.  “We’re quite worried about inflation,” vice-president
Eliseo Joao Viciana, who oversees 10 billion reais ($4.9
billion), said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “There
is a risk of the IPCA exceeding the upper-end of the target and
IGP-M returning to two digits.”  Mapfre DTVM, a Brazilian unit of the Spanish insurer, plans
to invest in bonds linked to inflation and companies that have
“good cash flow and capacity to pass through price increases,”
which will probably remain profitable as inflation accelerates,
he said.  Brazil’s central bank has lowered the Selic to a record low
of 7.5 percent in nine consecutive rate cuts since August 2011,
from 12.5 percent. The country targets inflation of 4.5 percent,
plus or minus two percentage points.  Economists surveyed by the central bank expect the IPCA
inflation to reach 5.51 percent and Selic to rise to 8.5 percent
next year, according to average estimate in the Focus survey
released yesterday.  Brazil’s prices as measured by the IGP-M index rose 1.43
percent in August, the  biggest increase  since November 2010. The
gauge gives producer prices a 60 percent weighting; consumer
prices 30 percent; and construction costs 10 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
