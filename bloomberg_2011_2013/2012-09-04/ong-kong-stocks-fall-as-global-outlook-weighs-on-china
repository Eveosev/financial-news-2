Hong Kong   stocks  fell after Moody’s
Investors Service cut the European Union’s economic outlook and
 Societe Generale  SA predicted weaker Chinese growth, which
fueled speculation of more government stimulus.  Mainland companies retreated after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
lowered earnings forecasts for publicly-traded companies in the
MSCI  China  Index.  Li & Fung (494)  Ltd., a supplier of clothes and toys
to retailers that gets more than 80 percent of sales from
abroad, fell 2.8 percent.  Mongolia Energy Corp. (276) , a mineral and
energy explorer, slumped 4.5 percent after saying it expects a
first-half loss.  Yashili International Holdings Ltd. (1230)  gained 3.3
percent after a report the dairy products producer may be an
acquisition target.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.3 percent to 19,507.99 as of
1:23 p.m. local time. The gauge has fallen five of the last
seven trading days. Volume was 14 percent below its 30-day
average for the time of day. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index of mainland companies dropped 0.6 percent to 9,233.32.  “Investors are waiting for further clues for monetary
easing from Europe, the U.S. and China, and that’s keeping them
on the sidelines,” said  Ben Kwong , chief operating officer at
KGI Asia Ltd., a Hong Kong-based brokerage. Central banks will
probably introduce stimulus measures, but “whether they will be
sufficient enough to satisfy investor expectation is another
thing.”  The Hang Seng Index  traded  at 10.4 times estimated earnings
on average yesterday, compared with 9.3 for the Shanghai
Composite Index and 13.6 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPXL1) 
The Hong Kong gauge climbed 7.6 percent from this year’s low on
June 4 through yesterday on optimism central banks will ease
monetary policy to boost slowing global economic growth.  Europe Outlook  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1
percent today, with the equity market set to reopen after
yesterday’s holiday.  Moody’s lowered the outlook on the EU’s Aaa long-term bond
rating from stable, citing the risks to Germany,  France , the
U.K. and the Netherlands that account for about 45 percent of
the group’s budget revenue.  While China will avoid a full-blown hard landing, a shift
to a new consumer-led growth model will see a structurally
weaker growth outlook, according to a report from Societe
Generale. The brokerage lowered its forecast for China’s real
gross domestic growth to 7.7 percent from 8.1 percent for 2012
and to 7.4 percent from 7.7 percent for 2013.  Goldman Report  Profits for companies in the  MSCI China Index (MXCN)  may increase
1.8 percent this year and 8.6 percent in 2013, compared with
previous growth estimates of 6 percent and 12.3 percent, Goldman
analysts Helen Zhu and Timothy Moe wrote in a report dated
yesterday. In a separate report, Citigroup Inc. said earnings
may rebound in the second half of the year as the government
further loosens policies.  Li & Fung retreated 2.8 percent to HK$11.94. The company’s
mergers and acquisitions may not be enough to offset a slowdown
in “organic” growth as it becomes more dependent on the U.S.
and Europe, Michelle Cheng, an analyst at BNP Paribas SA, wrote
in a report, rating the stock reduce in new coverage.  Mongolia Energy slumped 4.5 percent to 32 Hong Kong cents
after saying it expects a “substantial” loss for the interim
period ending Sept. 30 because of lower prices of coking coal
and a sluggish market in China.  Yashili International rose 3.3 percent to HK$1.55. The
company and  Biostime (1112)  International Holdings Ltd. are potential
targets for acquisition by Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. and Abbott
Laboratories, Hong Kong’s Sharp Daily reported, citing
unidentified people. Biostime climbed 3.6 percent to HK$19.58.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index were little changed at
19,415. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  slid 1.5 percent to 20.18,
indicating traders expect a swing of 5.8 percent for the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
