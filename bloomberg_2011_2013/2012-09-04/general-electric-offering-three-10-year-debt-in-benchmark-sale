General Electric Co. (GE) , the biggest
maker of power-generation equipment with $32 billion of bonds
 maturing  in the rest of 2012, plans to sell three- and 10-year
notes.  The company intends to issue new 10-year securities and
additional 1.625 percent debentures due in July 2015 through its
GE Capital unit for general corporate purposes, according to a
person familiar with the offering who asked not to be identified
because terms aren’t set. The deal will be of benchmark size,
typically at least $500 million, the person said.  GE’s $1.2 billion of 2015 notes, which priced to yield 125
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries when they
were sold on June 27, traded at 102 cents on the dollar last
week to yield 0.94 percent with a 64.7 basis-point spread,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The bonds may be rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service, its
fifth-highest level, and AA+ by  Standard & Poor’s , that
company’s second-highest grade, the person said.  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
Credit Suisse Group AG are managing the Fairfield, Connecticut-
based company’s sale of the 10-year bonds, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
