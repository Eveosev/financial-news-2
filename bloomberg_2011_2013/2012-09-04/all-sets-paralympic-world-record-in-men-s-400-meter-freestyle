Australia ’s Brenden Hall set a world
record to win the men’s 400-meter freestyle S9 swimming event at
the  London Paralympic Games  as  South Africa ’s Natalie du Toit
secured her 12th career gold medal.  Hall, 19, swam the event in 4 minutes, 10.88 seconds to win
his second gold in London after helping Australia win the 400-
meter freestyle relay. Hall’s countrywoman Jacqueline Freney, 20,
won her sixth swimming gold at the games last night in the 50-
meter freestyle S7 event.  China  leads the  medal standings  with 53 golds and 132 in
total after seven of 12 days of competition, while Britain has
23 golds and 79 in total. Third-place Russia also has 23 golds
among its 62 medals. Ukraine and Australia both have 18 golds,
though fourth-place Ukraine has won two more silver medals.  The games run through Sept. 9, with more than 4,000
athletes from 164 teams competing in a series of classes
depending on their impairment.  Du Toit, 28, won the women’s 400-meter freestyle S9 in a
time of 4:30.18. She came into the games with 10 golds from the
previous two Paralympics, and won the 100-meter butterfly S9
last week.  Du Toit is swimming in today’s 50-meter freestyle S9 final
and also will go for medals in the 100-meter freestyle and the
200-meter individual medley. She finished outside the medals in
the 100-meter backstroke and the 100-meter breaststroke.  The Netherlands’ Mirjam de Koning-Peper yesterday tied her
own world record of 34.77 seconds to win the women’s 50-meter
freestyle S6. Ihar Boki of Belarus claimed his fourth gold medal
in  London  by improving his own world record in the 400-meter
freestyle S13 to 3:58.78.  China’s Mi Na set a world record mark of 12.2 meters (40
feet) to win the women’s shot put F37 ahead of compatriot
Quiping Xu.  British wheelchair racer David Weir defended his men’s
1,500-meter T54 Paralympic title to claim his second gold in
London. Weir, 33, also won the 5,000-meter event three days ago
