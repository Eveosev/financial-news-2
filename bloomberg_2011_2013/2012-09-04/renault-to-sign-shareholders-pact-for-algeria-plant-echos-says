Renault SA (RNO)  and Algeria will sign a
shareholders pact in mid-September as part of a plan to build a
factory in the country,  Les Echos  said, citing Mohamed
Benmeradi, Algeria’s industry minister.  The plant will be 51 percent-owned by Algeria’s national
investment fund and the Societe Nationale des Vehicules
Industriels, and 49 percent-owned by Renault, the newspaper
said. Algeria has proposed locating the plant in Oued Tlelat,
near the city of Oran, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
