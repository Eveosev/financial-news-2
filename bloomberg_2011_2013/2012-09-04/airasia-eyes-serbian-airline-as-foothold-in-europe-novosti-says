AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) , Asia’s biggest
discount airline, may take over JAT Airways, Serbia’s state-
owned flag carrier,  Vecernje Novosti  newspaper reported, citing
an unidentified Serbian government official.  AirAsia representatives are meeting with Serbian officials
in Belgrade this week and may bid for the unprofitable airline
as it may choose the Serbian capital as a regional hub for
flights to Asia, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
