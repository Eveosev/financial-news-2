Andy Warhol ’s 1966 canvas of
leather-clad Marlon Brando on a motorcycle is expected to bring
about $20 million at Christie’s in New York in November.  Titled “Marlon,” the work comes from the collection of
Donald L. Bryant, a trustee of the Museum of  Modern Art  who
bought it for $5 million at Christie’s in 2003.  The current estimate is “very much in line with where the
market has gone for Warhol,” said  Brett Gorvy , chairman and
international head of postwar and contemporary art at
Christie’s.  In May,  Sotheby’s (BID)  sold a Warhol Elvis Presley for $37
million. In 2008, Christie’s sold “Double Marlon,” a canvas
larger than “Marlon” with two smaller Brando images, for $32.5
million.  For “Marlon,” Warhol used Brando’s publicity shot from
the 1953 movie “The Wild One,” printing the image on unprimed,
41-by-46-inch canvas. Four images of the same size exist, one of
which is loaned to the Tate in London, according to Gorvy.  “It’s the best of the four in terms of the image and
condition,” he said. “Because of the way the ink seeps into
the surface, the image registers extremely well.”  “Marlon” will be offered at Christie’s evening postwar
and contemporary art sale on Nov. 14 in  New York . It is
guaranteed by a third party, who has pledged to buy it for an
undisclosed minimum price.  To contact the reporter of this story:
