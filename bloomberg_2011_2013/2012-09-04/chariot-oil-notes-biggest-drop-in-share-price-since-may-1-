Chariot Oil & Gas Ltd. (CHAR) , the U.K.
explorer focused on  Namibia , noted the biggest slump in its
share price since May.  Chariot said the results of the Kabeljou well in the Nimrod
prospect, which started drilling on July 27 and is scheduled to
take 60 days to compete, aren’t yet known, according to a
statement today.  The stock plunged 21 pence to 100.25 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close of trading. More than 20 million shares traded, the most
since May and more than eight times the daily average of the
past three months.  The company, whose partners in Nimrod include  BP Plc (BP/)  and
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , is targeting 5 billion barrels of crude
at Nimrod. Chariot fell the most on record in May after saying
that no commercial hydrocarbons were found at the Tapir South
prospect.  “There is no news, and Chariot, and Petrobras, and BP are
keeping a very tight ship on any news coming off the rig,”
Emily Ashford, a London-based analyst at Finncap Ltd., said by
phone. It can “be possible market jitters.”  Namibia’s coastal shelf may mirror that of  Brazil  across
the Atlantic Ocean, where the Tupi field discovery in 2007 was
the biggest offshore find in the Americas in three decades.  Namibia has attracted attention from the world’s biggest
oil companies, with BP and  Repsol SA (REP)  buying stakes in the past
year. Petrobras is the operator of the Kabeljou well.  To contact the reporters on this story:
