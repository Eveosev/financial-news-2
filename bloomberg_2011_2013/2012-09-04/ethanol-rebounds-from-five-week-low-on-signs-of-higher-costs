Ethanol futures rebounded from a
five-week low on concern the corn crop will be lower than
government estimates, raising costs to make the biofuel.  Prices followed the grain higher as Allendale Inc.
estimated that the U.S. crop will be 10.326 billion bushels this
year, below the 10.779 billion the Agriculture Department
forecast Aug. 10.  “You did get some support to the upside in ethanol from
corn,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago .
“At an $8 price tag, they’re very hand-to-mouth here. They’re
covering their immediate needs and that’s about it.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to settle at $2.563 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade today. Futures have gained 16 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged on the West
Coast at $2.725 a gallon and in  New York  the additive increased
1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.675, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.645 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel jumped 0.5 cent to
$2.58.  Corn for December delivery climbed 5.25 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $8.05 a bushel in Chicago. The most-active contract
touched a record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Producers are losing 37 cents a gallon making ethanol from
corn, based on September contracts. A bushel yields about 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
