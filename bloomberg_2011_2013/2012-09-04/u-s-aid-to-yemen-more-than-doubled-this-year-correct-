(Corrects spelling of Yemen in headline.)  The U.S. has more than doubled its
aid to Yemen this year to $345 million, said Rajiv Shah,
administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.  Of that total, $185 million is to support political
transition, humanitarian assistance and development, Shah said
in a speech whose text was distributed to reporters in the Saudi
capital  Riyadh  today.  Shah is attending a conference to raise funds for Yemen,
the poorest Arab country, where a popular uprising last year
forced President Ali Abdullah Saleh to cede power. His former
deputy and successor, Abdurabu Mansur Hadi, faces continued
street protests, separatist movements and an insurgency by al-
Qaeda militants as he seeks to restore stability. The government
estimates it needs $11 billion in foreign aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
