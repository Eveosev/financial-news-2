European gasoline extended gains to
trade at the highest in more than four months.  Russia  will reduce gasoil exports and boost fuel oil
shipments from the port of Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea ,
according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded at $1,150 a metric ton on the barge market,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Argus bulletin board. That compares with transactions from
$1,124 to $1,138 a ton yesterday and is the most since April 16,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vitol Group bought the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is
added to make finished fuel. OAO Lukoil’s Litasco unit sold.
Barge lots usually comprise 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to Brent crude, increased to
$10.41 a barrel from $10.03 in the previous session, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and products
broker in London.  Naphtha’s  discount  to  Brent crude  narrowed to $4.88 a
barrel from $5.20 yesterday, PVM data showed. It closed at $3.90
a barrel on Aug. 31, which was the smallest loss in six months.  Middle Distillates  Russia will ship 14 cargoes, or 244,400 tons, of gasoil
this month from Novorossiysk, a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News shows. That’s down from 280,800 tons in August,
according to the plan.  Gasoil for September delivery climbed $2.25, or 0.2
percent, to $1,003.75 a ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange
in London as of 12:14 p.m. local time. The more active October
contract traded at a 50-cent premium, or contango, to September.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability,
declined to $18.64 a barrel versus $18.85 as of 4:30 p.m.
yesterday. Brent was up 0.2 percent at $116.02 a barrel.  Residues  Russia will sell 10 consignments of  fuel oil , or 350,000
tons, in September from the Black Sea port, according to the
loading plan. That’s up from 280,000 tons in the previous month.  Fuel-oil shipments to  Asia  from Western countries in
October more than doubled from a week earlier to 3 million
metric tons, according to vessel-charter data and information
from traders compiled by Bloomberg.  Thirteen tankers, including ten very large crude carriers,
are scheduled to arrive in Asia next month after loading at
ports in Europe, the U.S. and the Caribbean, data from
shipbrokers including Poten & Partners Inc. show. The October
volume compares with 1.43 million tons reported a week earlier.
