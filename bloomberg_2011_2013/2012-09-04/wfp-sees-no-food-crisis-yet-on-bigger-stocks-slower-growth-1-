The world has avoided a food crisis
so far because international rice and grain stocks are higher
than in 2008 and global economic growth is slower, the  United
Nations ’ food-relief agency said.  Rice prices in  Asia  are relatively stable, and there hasn’t
been any restriction of exports or panic buying so far, the
Rome-based  World Food Programme  wrote in a statement on its
website today.  Wheat prices have jumped 23 percent in the past 12 months
and corn rose 7.7 percent on concern drought in the U.S. and
 Russia  will curb grain supplies. Thai rice prices fell about 8
percent amid an outlook for higher production. Rising food costs
triggered more than 60 riots worldwide from 2007 to 2009,
according to the U.S. State Department.  “Although we need to be prepared for a possibility of a
repeat of 2007-08, as yet this is not a food crisis,” the WFP
wrote. “In contrast to 2008, global economic growth is
presently weak, so demand is not pushing prices further
upwards.”  Countries are better prepared for high food prices
after establishing or improving social safety nets such as
school meals, according to the UN agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
