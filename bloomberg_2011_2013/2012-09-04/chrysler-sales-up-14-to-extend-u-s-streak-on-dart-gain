U.S. auto sales in August continued
to outpace the anemic economic recovery, smash through estimates
and deliver a good-news story for President  Barack Obama  and the
Democrats just in time for their convention.  Chrysler Group LLC,  Ford Motor Co. (F) , General Motors Co.,
Toyota Motor Corp. and  Honda (7267)  Motor Co. said U.S. sales in August
rose more than analysts estimated as new models such as the
Dodge Dart, Ford Escape and Chevrolet Spark built on gains
earlier this year. Light-vehicle deliveries last month were at
the fastest pace since the government’s 2009 “cash for
clunkers” program.  “It just is a story that makes it easier for the president
to take credit for what’s happening in the U.S. auto industry,”
 Jeremy Anwyl , vice chairman of auto-market researcher
Edmunds.com, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “When
you’re dealing with headlines and sound bites, these results add
credibility to the statement, ‘Look at the good I did.’”  Republican nominee  Mitt Romney  has criticized the bailout.
His vice presidential choice,  Paul Ryan , made it clear that
autos will be much-debated in next two months when he cited a
shuttered sport-utility vehicle plant as part of Obama’s
failures in his acceptance speech. That plant had stopped making
GM trucks before Obama became president.  U.S. auto sales are on pace to exceed 14 million vehicles
for the best year since 2007 and to gain at least 10 percent for
a third-straight year, the first such streak since 1973. The
industry’s rebound has spurred hiring at automobile assembly
plants from  Michigan  to Alabama, as Toyota and Honda are both on
pace this year to break their 2007 records for North American
output.  Third Shifts  GM, adding third shifts to factories in four states, has
created 4,300 jobs working odd hours. Automakers, including
Chrysler,  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , have announced
plans to add production beyond the normal two-shift day in at
least 15 plants.  Michigan’s unemployment rate has declined to 9 percent as
in July from a 26-year high of  14.2 percent  in August 2009,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The U.S.
unemployment rate was 8.3 percent in July.  The stronger-than-expected results from the five biggest
sellers of cars and light trucks in the U.S. “is an affirmation
that the automotive market is strong,” Alan Baum, principal of
auto-industry forecaster Baum & Associates in West Bloomfield,
Michigan, said yesterday in a telephone interview. “This would
normally be a time in the year when model year-end incentives
kick in, and there were some targeted incentives in place that
were effective.”  Topping Estimates  Chrysler sales last month increased 14 percent, the  Auburn
Hills , Michigan-based company said yesterday in a statement.
Ford’s car and light-truck deliveries rose 13 percent and GM’s
climbed 10 percent. The automakers topped 10 analysts’ average
estimates of 9.9 percent for Chrysler, 8.5 percent for Ford and
3 percent for GM.  Honda and  Toyota (7203)  sales surged 60 percent and 46 percent to
exceed seven analysts’ average estimate for gains of 59 percent
and 40 percent. Accord deliveries climbed 89 percent to 34,848,
the Tokyo-based automaker said yesterday in a statement. Sales
of the Prius line of hybrid models and RAV4 sport-utility
vehicle both more than doubled, according to a  statement 
yesterday on Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota’s  website .  Nissan Motor Co. sales rose 7.6 percent, according to a
statement. The Yokohama, Japan-based automaker missed seven
analysts’ average estimate for a 12 percent increase. Deliveries
of the Altima, which Nissan is updating for the 2013 model year
and adding capacity, gained 12 percent to 25,889.  Chrysler Gains  Chrysler, the automaker controlled by  Fiat SpA (F) , said
deliveries of the Dart almost quadrupled from a month earlier to
3,045, helping extend its streak of U.S. sales gains to 29
months. Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  is counting on
a steady climb in demand for Dart, introduced in June, as
Chrysler continues to update its lineup.  “We expect Chrysler to continue to gobble up incremental
share in the compact-car segment,” Alec Gutierrez, an analyst
at Irvine, California-based auto-market researcher Kelley Blue
Book, said in a telephone interview. “Chrysler is still trying
to get enough selection of variety out to their dealers to
satisfy demand. Their product portfolio has improved.”  Ford, which just introduced a new Escape small SUV, said
sales of the model rose 37 percent to 28,188. Ford also said it
added a third shift to the Escape factory in Kentucky last month
to meet demand. Deliveries of F-Series pickups climbed 19
percent to 58,201, the model line’s best monthly total this
year, according to a statement yesterday.  No Apologies  “There’s nothing in our lineup that I have to apologize
for,” Beau Boeckmann, vice president of Galpin Motors in  Van
Nuys ,  California , said yesterday in a telephone interview. The
dealership, Ford’s largest in the U.S., had a 20 percent sales
gain on the strength of new models.  U.S. light-vehicle sales accelerated to a 14.5 million
seasonally adjusted annualized rate, according to researcher
Autodata Corp. That’s the market’s best sales pace since 14.6
million in August 2009, when the U.S. government offered
incentives for buyers to exchange older vehicles for new models.
The industry exceeded 15 analysts’ average estimate of 14.2
million in a Bloomberg News survey.  The sales pace in August 2011 was 12.5 million.  Industrywide deliveries this year through August climbed 15
percent to 9.71 million,  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based
Autodata said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  2012 Outlook  GM expects full-year 2012 U.S. light-vehicle sales will be
in the 14 million to 14.5 million range, Sue Yingzi Su, GM’s
senior economist, told reporters yesterday on a conference call,
reiterating a previous estimate. The forecast could be narrowed,
to perhaps “slightly” above 14 million, she said.  GM slipped 0.2 percent to $21.31 at the close yesterday in
New York. Shares of Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford rose 0.7
percent to $9.41.  General Motors Corp. entered bankruptcy court protection on
June 1, 2009, and the new  General Motors Co. (GM)  emerged on July 10,
2009. The  U.S. Treasury  and other  owners  sold $15.8 billion of
common shares and the automaker sold $4.35 billion of preferred
shares in a November 2010 initial public offering.  Since bankruptcy, Detroit-based GM has announced more than
$7.3 billion of investments for U.S. factories that retain or
create 18,600 jobs, said Bill Grotz, a spokesman. The company
earned a record full-year net income of $9.19 billion in 2011
while surpassing Toyota as the world’s top-selling automaker.  GM ran an eight-week promotion that expired yesterday for
its Chevrolet brand that offered no-haggle pricing on 2012 car
and truck models plus a money-back guarantee. The automaker set
monthly records for the Chevy brand’s Spark, Sonic, Cruze and
Volt models, according to a statement yesterday.  Gasoline Prices  Car sales may have been boosted in part because the
national  average price  for regular unleaded gasoline climbed 8.7
percent in August, the biggest monthly increase since April
2011, to $3.83 a gallon, according to AAA, the biggest U.S.
motoring organization.  Passenger-car deliveries climbed 28 percent to 650,576,
topping the 13 percent gain in light-truck sales to 634,626,
according to Autodata.  Honda, GM, Toyota and Chrysler all are using so-called
stair-step programs this year to give rewards to dealers whose
sales reach thresholds set by the companies. Programs such as
Honda’s, which started in March to boost Accord deliveries and
ran through August, offer incentives for dealers of as much as
$1,000 per Accord sale and extend bonuses retroactively for cars
sold in previous months, too.  Accord Clearance  Honda’s six-month Accord program helped to wind down
inventory of the 2012 model to clear way for the redesigned 2013
Accord, and kick-started Honda’s recovery in the U.S. from
inventory shortages and corresponding market-share losses caused
by Japan’s March 2011 tsunami.  U.S. market share for Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota rose
1.7 percentage points through August to 14.4 percent and 0.7
percentage points for Honda to 9.8 percent, according to
Autodata.  South Korea’s  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and Kia Motors Corp.
combined to sell 11 percent more vehicles in August than a year
earlier. That was less than the 19 percent average gain of five
analysts’ estimates. Hyundai said deliveries of the Sonata and
Genesis sedans slipped in August from a year earlier in a
statement. Kia’s sales of the Optima sedan more than doubled to
13,949, according to a statement.  Volkswagen Gains  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , targeting more than 500,000 vehicle sales in
the U.S. this year, increased combined deliveries of its
Volkswagen and Audi brands by 48 percent in August, beating the
average 46 percent average gain of four analysts’ estimates. The
Volkswagen brand sold 41,011 vehicles last month, a 63 percent
increase from a year earlier, according to a statement.  VW brand sales, the best August since 1973, were fueled by
sales of the new Passat sedan, which rose to 10,090 last month
compared with 314 a year earlier, the company said in a
statement.  “I haven’t seen any softening,” Frank Trivieri, vice
president of sales at Volkswagen of America, said yesterday on a
conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
