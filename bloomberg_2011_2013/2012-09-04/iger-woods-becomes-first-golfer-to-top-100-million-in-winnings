Tiger Woods became the first golfer
to surpass $100 million in career winnings on the U.S.  PGA Tour 
with his third-place finish at the Deutsche Bank Championship.  Woods, 36, received $544,000 yesterday by finishing two
shots behind winner Rory McIlroy at the second of the four
FedExCup playoff events. He’s now collected almost $100.4
million in prize money since turning professional in 1996.  As Woods won 14 major championships and dominated the sport
-- spending a record 281 weeks at No. 1 in the Official World
Rankings -- tournament purses increased as the value of the PGA
Tour’s sponsorships and television contracts surged.  “It’s just that we happened to time it up right and
happened to play well when the purses really had a nice spike
up,” Woods said at a news conference. “It was nice to have a
nice start to my career, and I won some majors early. I think we
got some interest in the game of golf.”  Vijay Singh  of Fiji is second behind Woods with $66.79
million in career earnings, almost $179,000 ahead of Phil Mickelson in third place on the PGA Tour’s  career earnings list .  Woods has 74 career PGA Tour wins, second behind  Sam Snead ’s 82 victories, and his 14 titles in the sport’s four
majors are four behind  Jack Nicklaus ’s record. Nicklaus, 72, had
$5.73 million in career winnings, while Snead, who died in 2002
at the age of 89, totaled $713,155.  “The purse increase helps,” Woods said. “I’ve won fewer
tournaments than Sam Snead has. Obviously he was in a different
era.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
