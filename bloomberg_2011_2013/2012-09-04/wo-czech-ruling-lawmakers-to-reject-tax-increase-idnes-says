Two members of Czech Premier Petr
Necas’s party won’t support in parliament a government bill
raising taxes,  iDnes.cz  reported, citing lawmakers Tomas Ulehla
and Petr Tluchor.  If the bill is rejected, Necas is ready to submit it again
and link it to a vote of confidence in the government, iDnes.cz,
the website of the newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes reported, citing
an unidentified lawmaker. Necas has said the government would
have no reason to continue if the lower house rejects the bill,
which is needed to cut the  budget deficit .  The ruling coalition holds 100 mandates in the 200-seat
lower house, one vote short of the majority needed to override
the Senate, which in August rejected the legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
