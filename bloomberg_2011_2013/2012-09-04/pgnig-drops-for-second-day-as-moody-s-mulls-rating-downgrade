Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA  declined for a second day as Moody’s Investors
Service said it may reduce the debt rating of  Poland ’s dominant
natural-gas company.  The shares retreated 0.5 percent to 4.03 zloty as of 1:19
p.m. in Warsaw. The WIG20 index of Polish stocks lost 0.3
percent to 2,258.27, falling for the first time in three days.  Moody’s will review PGNiG’s Baa1 rating, the third-lowest
investment grade, for a possible downgrade because of “weak
operational performance” in the first half of the year combined
with growing debt, Joanna Fic and Andrew Blease, London-based
analysts at the company, said in a statement today.  State-owned PGNiG posted on Aug. 23 an unexpected second-
quarter loss on rising import costs of natural gas from  Russia .
Net loss widened to 314 million zloty ($94 million) from 20
million zloty a year earlier, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
