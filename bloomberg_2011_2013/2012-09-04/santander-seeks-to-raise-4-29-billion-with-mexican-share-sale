Banco Santander SA (SAN)  said it would
seek to raise as much as $4.29 billion with a sale of shares in
its Mexican unit as  Spain ’s biggest bank bolsters capital after
booking charges for its Spanish real estate.  Santander will seek to sell as much as 24.9 percent of its
Grupo Financiero Santander  Mexico  SAB unit at 29 pesos to 33.50
pesos a share, the lender said in an e-mailed statement today.
The sale of the stock, which will start trading in Mexico and
 New York  on or about Sept. 26, values the unit at as much as
$17.2 billion, the Santander, Spain-based lender said.  The share sale will help Santander bolster capital after it
set aside 21 billion euros ($26.4 billion) in provisions since
the start of last year to cover losses on souring assets such as
Spanish real estate. The Mexican sale will add about half a
percentage point to Santander’s core  capital  ratio, a measure of
financial strength, which stood at 10.1 percent at the end of
June under Basel II rules.  Santander will seek to sell 20 percent of the shares in
Mexico and the rest in the U.S. and elsewhere, the company said.
The deal will be the largest ever share sale by a company in
Mexico. Santander Mexico will be the only financial institution
from that country to trade in New York, the bank said.  The company said the Mexican stake sale was part of its
strategy of seeking stock listings for its banks in the
countries where it operates. The bank will seek to list all its
major units within five years, Chairman  Emilio Botin  said in a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
