Canadian Natural Resource Minister
Joe Oliver said his government has estimated natural resource
companies are planning to invest C$650 billion ($659 billion) in
the country over the next decade.  That’s 30 percent more than the government had projected a
year ago, Oliver said, according to the prepared text of a
speech he’s giving today in Toronto. Oliver also said that his
department estimates natural resource production accounts
directly for 15 percent of  Canada ’s nominal output, and adds
another 4 percent to output indirectly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
