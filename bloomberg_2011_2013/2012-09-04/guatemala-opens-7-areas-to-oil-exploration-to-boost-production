Guatemala will open seven new sites
to oil exploration bids as Central America’s biggest crude
producer struggles to reverse declining output.  Guatemala, which shares its northern border with Mexico,
will open up nearly 800,000 hectares (2 million acres) for
exploration and will discuss offers with interested companies
over the next three months, according to a  statement  posted on
the  Finance Ministry ’s website. The winning bidders will be
announced early next year.  Oil production in Guatemala has fallen to 10,000 barrels
per day from 30,000 barrels per day over the last 30 years,
according to Energy and Mining Minister Erick Archila. Central
America’s biggest economy intends to increase production to
80,000 barrels per day by 2022, he said in a July 12 interview.  At least 80 companies, including Colombia’s  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) 
and  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , have requested information
about the exploration options, according to the ministry. The
government is also in talks with Vancouver-based  Ivanhoe Energy
Inc. (IVAN)  to construct a refinery to process the country’s heavy
petroleum, Archila said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
