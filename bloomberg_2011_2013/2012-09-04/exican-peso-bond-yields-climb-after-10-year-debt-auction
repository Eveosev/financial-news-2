Yields on Mexican local currency
bonds due in 10 years rose after the  Finance Ministry  sold 8.5
billion pesos ($645 million) of the debt at auction today.  The yield on the debt due in June 2022 rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.45 percent at 4 p.m. in
 Mexico  City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
on the bonds due in 2024 rose four basis points to 5.54 percent.
The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 13.1782 per dollar.  Mexican peso debt maturing in 10 years or more slumped as
investors digested the additional supply that the debt sale
created, according to Alejandro Urbina, who manages and advises
on about $800 million of emerging-market assets at Silva Capital
Management. The bid-to-cover ratio at the auction, a measure of
investor demand, was 2.6.  “There was a placement or emission which put some pressure
on the long-end,” Urbina said in a telephone interview. “There
still wasn’t much participation by foreigners. There was pension
fund selling possibly ahead of the emission.”  Mexico also sold all 7 billion pesos ($531 million) of 28-
day Cetes it offered at auction today. The country also
auctioned off all 8 billion pesos of the 91-day securities and
all 9 billion pesos in 182-day bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
