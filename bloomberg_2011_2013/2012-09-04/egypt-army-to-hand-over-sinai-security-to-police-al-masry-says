Egypt â€™s military plans to shift the
responsibility for a long-term security plan in Sinai to the
 Interior Ministry , the independent Al-Masry Al-Youm reported,
citing an unidentified security official.  The official said the armed forces are not able to continue
operating in Sinai for long periods of time and that security
forces under the Interior Ministry are responsible for
combatting terrorism and criminals, the Cairo-based newspaper
reported. The military boosted its forces in Sinai after
unidentified gunmen killed 16 Egyptian border guards last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
