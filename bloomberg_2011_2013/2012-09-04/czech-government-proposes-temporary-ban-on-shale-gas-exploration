The  Czech Republic  proposed to ban
shale-gas exploration until at least mid-2014 as it prepares
laws to regulate the technology’s effect on the environment.  The moratorium is expected to begin in the middle of
October after it’s approved by the government, Environment
Minister Tomas Chalupa said on the ministry’s  website .  “The current law doesn’t adequately cover the entire
process of unconventional gas mining,” he said. Laws should
reflect “technologies and their impact on the environment.”  Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves pumping water
mixed with sand and chemicals underground at pressure to free
hydrocarbons trapped in shale rock. While the U.S. has used the
method to become the largest natural-gas producer, France and
Bulgaria have banned the technology because of environmental
concerns. Exxon Mobil Corp. pulled out of exploration in  Poland 
after two wells failed to find commercially viable gas reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
