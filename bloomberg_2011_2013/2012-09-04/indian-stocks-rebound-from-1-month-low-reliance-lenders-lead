Indian stocks rebounded from their
lowest level in a month as some investors judged the recent
declines as excessive, and amid optimism a revival in monsoon
rains will help policymakers’ efforts to revive growth.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the world’s largest
oil-refining complex, rallied 2.2 percent after falling to the

1.1 percent.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  rebounded from a three-week low.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.3 percent
to 17,440.87 at the close. Yesterday, the gauge ended at its
lowest level since Aug. 3. A revival in the monsoon has helped
narrow the deficit to 12 percent from 29 percent at the end of
June, according to the weather office. Bigger harvests of rice,
oilseeds and cereals will help cool the  inflation  rate that is
the highest among the largest developing economies, potentially
improving chances of the central bank reducing borrowing costs.  “The market had drifted in the past few days without any
major negatives and that has provided investors an opportunity
for value-picking,” said Sunil Pachisia, vice-president at
brokerage Pratibhuti Viniyog Ltd. in Mumbai. “The monsoon has
improved significantly, which should help bring down inflation
and increase chances of a rate cut.”  Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao last reduced the
benchmark repurchase rate in April after growth slowed for a
fourth quarter. Borrowing costs have been kept unchanged at
policy reviews in June and July on concern inadequate rainfall
will fuel inflation.  BRIC Inflation  Consumer  prices  rose 9.86 percent in July, faster than the

August, a private survey showed yesterday.  The Sensex retreated 2 percent last week, its first weekly
decline in five and the biggest since the week ended May 11. The
