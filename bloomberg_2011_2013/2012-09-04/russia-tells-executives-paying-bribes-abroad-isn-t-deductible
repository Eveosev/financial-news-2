Russia , the world’s most corrupt
major economy, issued a statement telling executives that they
can’t claim  tax deductions  at home for bribes paid abroad.  “Expenses incurred while committing legal violations,
including providing bribes or kickbacks, are not recognized for
the purposes of tax assessment,” the  Finance Ministry  said in a
 statement  posted on its website yesterday.  The ministry’s press service declined to comment on the
statement immediately today.  The issuance of the statement is related to Russia’s
obligations under the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development’s Anti-Bribery Convention, not in response to a
request from a specific company, the Vedomosti newspaper
 reported  today, citing an unidentified ministry official.  Russia joined the Anti-Bribery Convention in February and
officially became the 39th signatory in April, according to the
 OECD ’s website.  Russia ranks alongside  Nigeria  at 143rd of 182 countries in
Berlin-based Transparency International’s 2011 Corruption
Perceptions  Index , making it the most corrupt member of the
Group of 20 countries.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
