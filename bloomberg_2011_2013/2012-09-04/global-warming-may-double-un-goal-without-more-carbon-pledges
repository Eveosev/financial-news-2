International pledges to reduce
 greenhouse gases  may fail to stop global warming from rising to
twice the level deemed safe by United Nations scientists,
Climate Action Tracker said.  Without further action to lower emissions of heat-trapping
gases, the planet is set to warm by 2.6 to 4.1 degrees Celsius,
the project, run by three European research groups, said today
in a  report  released in Bangkok, where the UN is holding a week
of informal discussions.  That level of warming exceeds the 2-degrees Celsius (3.6
degrees Fahrenheit) ceiling that UN envoys have set as a global
goal. That target is technically achievable, and it’s up to
politicians to ensure it’s met, said Bill Hare, director of
Climate Analytics, one of the groups that set up the project.  “It is a question of political will, not technological
feasibility, as to whether 2 degrees Celsius is out the
window,” Hare said in the statement.  Aside from Climate Analytics in Potsdam,  Germany , the
tracker is run by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact
Research and Ecofys, a consultant with offices in the U.S.,
 China , Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
