DTE Energy Co. (DTE) ,  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and
 Spectra Energy Corp. (SE)  agreed to spend as much as $1.5 billion to
jointly develop a pipeline that will move natural gas from
Ohio’s Utica Shale to markets in the Midwest and eastern Canada.  The proposed Nexus Gas Transmission system would include
250 miles (400 kilometers) of pipe capable of moving 1 billion
cubic feet of gas a day to Michigan and Ontario, according to a
statement today. The cost is estimated at $1.2 billion to $1.5
billion, Houston-based Spectra said in a separate statement.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , Devon Energy Corp. and Exxon Mobil
Corp. have begun tapping into the Utica formation, which
stretches from Kentucky to Ontario. The Ohio portion may produce
as much as 5.5 billion barrels of oil and 15.7 trillion cubic
feet of gas, according to the state’s Department of Natural
Resources.  The proposed pipeline, which may begin operating by
November 2015, is intended to deliver gas from the Utica Shale
to serve power plants and industrial customers. The partners
plan to hold an open season to seek customers in the fourth
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
