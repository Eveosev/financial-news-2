U.S. government debt  reached $16
trillion for the first time after rising $1 trillion since
November, according to Treasury Department data.  The debt rose to $16.02 trillion on Aug. 31 as Republicans
and Democrats debate ways to trim the  budget deficit . The
parties will have to negotiate on raising the $16.4 trillion
federal debt ceiling. Treasury officials have said the U.S. will
reach the limit in the fourth quarter of this year and can take
measures so that Congress doesnâ€™t have to raise it until 2013.  U.S. government debt reached $14 trillion in December 2010
and $13 trillion in June 2010. Ten years ago today the debt was
$6.2 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
