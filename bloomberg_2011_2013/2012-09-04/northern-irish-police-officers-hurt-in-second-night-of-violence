Rioters in Northern Ireland injured
15 policemen during a second night of violence in  Belfast , in
some of the worst trouble experienced in the region this year.  Officers used water cannon and fired plastic bullets, the
Police Service of Northern Ireland said in a statement today.
Rival Protestant and Catholic gangs threw petrol bombs, bricks
and bottles, and pushed a hijacked van into police lines.  “Again we find ourselves subject to serious violence,”
said Will Kerr, assistant chief constable of the region’s police
force. “The negative impact of these violent pictures on jobs,
tourism and investment cannot be underestimated.”  Rioters injured 50 police in the first night of trouble.
The violence was sparked by a parade, which remain frequent
flash points for confrontation even after armed violence in
 Northern Ireland  largely ended more than a decade ago.  The  Parades Commission , an independent body which rules on
contentious marches, allowed the September 2 parade by
republicans, who want a united Ireland, to take place without
restrictions.  The Orange Order, a mainly Protestant marching group,
criticized that decision and said the Parades Commission should
be disbanded. Orange Order leaders said a Protestant parade
planned for the end of this month in the same area must be
allowed to proceed without any restrictions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
