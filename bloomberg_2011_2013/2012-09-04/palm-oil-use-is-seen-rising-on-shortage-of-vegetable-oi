Palm-oil  use is expected to climb in
the year through September 2013 to compensate for a shortage of
other vegetable oils, Oil World said.  World palm-oil consumption will climb to 53.9 million
metric tons from 50.7 million tons in 2011-12, the Hamburg-based
oilseed researcher said in an e-mailed report.  Palm-oil futures traded in  Malaysia  have fallen 4.1 percent
this year, compared with a 12 percent increase for  Rotterdam
sunflower oil . Oil World forecasts a decline in production of
oil from sunflower seeds, cotton seed and peanuts.  “Global dependence on palm oil will rise significantly in
the next 12 months to compensate insufficient supplies of other
vegetable oils,” Oil World wrote. “We expect palm oil prices
to recover owing to increased export demand.”  World production of eight vegetable oils will climb to
153.4 million tons in the year through September 2013 from 149.9
million tons, led by the increase in output of palm oil,
according to the industry researcher.  Palm oil output in  Indonesia  is forecast to climb to 26.6
million tons from 25 million tons, while Malaysia’s production
is predicted to increase to 19.4 million tons from 18.1 million
tons, Oil World wrote.  “In Malaysia, yields have started to recover and we expect
a much better profitability of the trees in the next 12
months,” Oil World said.  Production of sunflower oil is forecast to fall to 14
million tons from 15.1 million tons, output of  soybean oil  is
seen rising to 42.7 million tons from 42 million tons and
rapeseed-oil production will gain to 24.4 million tons from 23.9
million tons, according to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
