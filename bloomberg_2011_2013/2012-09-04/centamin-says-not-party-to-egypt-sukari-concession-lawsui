Centamin Plc (CEY)  said today it is not
party to a lawsuit seeking to void the concession allowing it to
extract gold from the Sukari mine.  The case, filed by Hamdy El Fakharany, a lawmaker with the
now-dissolved parliament, seeks the nullification of the
concession granted to Centamin on the grounds it had not been
submitted for parliamentary approval. An Egyptian administrative
court said today it would announce its decision on Oct. 30 after
reviewing the recommendation from its advisory body, which said
the court did not have purview over the case. The panel’s ruling
is not binding on the court.  Centamin said in an e-mailed statement the hearing on Oct.
30 was to consider the advisory panel’s recommendation that the
case “should in fact be dismissed” and that it had not been
served with any papers relating to the case.  “The Sukari concession agreement is, itself, an act of
parliament passed in 1994, and outside the scope of the court
process,” Andy Davidson, the company’s head of business
development and  investor relations , said in e-mailed comments.  Centamin operates the mine as a 50-50 joint venture with
the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
