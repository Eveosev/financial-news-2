Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International Inc. (VRX) , Canada’s largest publicly traded drugmaker,
obtained a $2.75 billion bridge loan to support its acquisition
of  Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. (MRX)   JPMorgan Chase & Co. is providing the financing, the
company said in a filing today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Bridge financings usually mature in one year and are
often used as backstops to bond offerings or longer-dated bank
debt.  “We will finance the transaction with the combination of
term loan and bonds,” Chief Executive Officer J. Michael
Pearson said on a conference call.  The transaction will push the company’s leverage, or debt
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, to 4.2 times, Pearson said.  Moody’s Investors Service today placed Valeant on review
for downgrade because the acquisition may “push Valeant’s
leverage beyond Moody’s tolerance level for the Ba3 rating”,
credit analyst Michael Levesque wrote in a research report.  Valeant is acquiring Medicis for $44 per share,
representing a 39 percent premium to Medicis’s trading price at
market close on Aug. 31.  Bridge facilities are short-term loans that usually mature
in one year and are often used as backstops to bond offerings or
longer-dated bank debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
