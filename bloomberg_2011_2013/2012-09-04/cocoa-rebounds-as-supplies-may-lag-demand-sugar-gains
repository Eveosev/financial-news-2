Arabica coffee climbed for a second
session in New York on signs of limited supply from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer. Cocoa and sugar slid.  Farmers in Brazil are hoarding part of their production to
wait for price increases, the National Coffee Council said in a
report last week. The price has dropped 27 percent this year on
forecasts for a bigger harvest in Brazil.  “Brazilian offers remain light,”  Jack Scoville , a vice
president for Price Futures Group in Chicago, said today in a
report. “Farmers there are not offering much, and are offering
lower qualities when they offer at all.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to
close at $1.653 a pound at 1:46 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Earlier, the price climbed as much as 1.9 percent.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators held the biggest
coffee net-short position, or bets on prices declines, since May
2007, with 16,866  contracts  in the week ended Aug. 28, data from
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  “Funds are holding a new record short position in  New
York , and prices have hardly moved,” Keith Flury, an analyst at
Rabobank International in  London , said by e-mail today.
“Roasters seem to be there ready to buy when prices fall.”  Cocoa futures for December delivery slumped 2.3 percent to
$2,551 a metric ton in New York.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery dropped 2.2 percent
to 19.34 cents a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
