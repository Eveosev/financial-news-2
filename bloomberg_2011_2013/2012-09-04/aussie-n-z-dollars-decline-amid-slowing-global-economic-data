The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars fell to more than one-month lows versus the greenback as
crude-oil futures and stocks declined amid reduced demand for
riskier assets.  The two South Pacific nations’ currencies weakened after a
report showed manufacturing in the U.S.  contracted  for a third
month and before reports today that may show retail sales in the
euro area declined and services contracted. The New Zealand
dollar fell versus all but one of its most-traded peers after
the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand said it will keep its cash rate
at 2.5 percent until 2014.  Weaker manufacturing figures “weighed on the outlook for
global growth,” Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist at
Gain Capital Group LLC in  New York , wrote yesterday in a note to
clients. “As a result, high-beta currencies were under
pressure.” High-beta currencies tend to have the greatest
volatility.  The Aussie fell 0.2 percent to $1.0225 in New York
yesterday, after earlier declining as much as 0.3 percent to its
lowest level since July 25. The currency was little changed at
80.19 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, known as the kiwi, decreased 0.4
percent to 79.45 U.S. cents, after sinking as much as 0.7
percent to its lowest level since July 26. The kiwi fell 0.2
percent to 62.31 yen.  Crude oil futures declined 1 percent to $95.54 a barrel in
New York and the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell 0.1 percent.  Retracement Decline  The Australian dollar may be set for further declines
against the yen as it tests a support area defined by a so-
called Fibonacci retracement level, UBS AG said.  The Aussie has been testing 80.10 yen, the 38 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its advance from a low of 74.48 on June
1 to a high of 83.58 on Aug. 21,  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-
income technical strategy in  London , wrote in an e-mailed note
to clients. The currency may head toward 79.54 yen and then to
79.03 yen, Adcock wrote.  The Australian dollar-yen cross “has been under selling
pressure,” Adcock wrote. “With the recent weakness seeing
daily and weekly trending tools turn negative, the picture is
bearish.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
