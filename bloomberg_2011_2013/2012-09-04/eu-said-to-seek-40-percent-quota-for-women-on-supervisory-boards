European companies may be required
to appoint women to 40 percent of seats on supervisory boards by
2020 under a European Union proposal to be published next month,
according to a person familiar with the plan.  Companies would face sanctions including fines, exclusion
from government tenders and a ban on public subsidies, if they
fail to comply, said the person who asked not to be identified
because the plan isn’t yet public. The sanctions, which would
also allow authorities to revoke other board appointments, would
be set by national governments.  The EU draft law to redress the gender imbalance would
apply to all listed companies with more than 250 employees and
annual sales of more than 50 million euros ($63 million), the
person said. State-owned companies would be required to
introduce the quotas by 2018 to set an example for other firms.  Some 13.7 percent of board seats in the EU belong to women
after a 1.9 percentage point increase between October 2010 and
January 2012, the European Commission said in a  report  in March.
EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding last year asked
businesses to appoint more women to company boards. LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA is  among only 24 companies  that signed
 Reding’s pledge  to increase female board members to 30 percent
by 2015 and 40 percent by 2020.  The quotas would apply to supervisory or non-executive
board members, the person said. Companies that don’t meet the
quotas could argue their case if they weren’t able to appoint
enough qualified women.  Large Companies  The commission’s proposal will need the backing of most of
the EU’s 27 member states and the European Parliament, who can
both amend a draft law before it becomes final.  The EU’s plans were reported by the Financial Times
earlier.  Spain  has a target for 40 percent of female representation
on large company boards by 2015, and  France  passed a law last
year to impose a 20 percent quota by 2014 and 40 percent by 2017
for companies with at least 500 employees and annual sales of 50
million euros.  Norway , which is not part of the EU, in 2003 set
a quota for at least 40 percent of corporate board seats to be
filled by women.  To contact the reporter on this story:
