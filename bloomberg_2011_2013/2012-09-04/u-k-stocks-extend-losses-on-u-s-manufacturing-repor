U.K. stocks extended losses after
data showed U.S. manufacturing contracted last month, fueling
concern the economic recovery is slowing.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index dropped 1.5 percent to
5,671.53 at 3:08 p.m. in London.  The  Institute for Supply Management â€™s U.S. factory index
fell to 49.6 in August from 49.8 a month earlier. Economists in
a Bloomberg survey projected an August reading of 50, which is
the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
