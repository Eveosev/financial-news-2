The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index
erased an earlier loss as a rally in  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  sparked a
rebound in technology shares.  The S&P 500 rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,406.91 at 2:36
p.m. New York time, reversing a decline of as much as 0.7
percent.  Apple jumped 1.3 percent as it sent out invitations to a
Sept. 12 product event in San Francisco, where the company is
expected to introduce a redesigned iPhone.  U.S. stocks fell earlier as data showed American
manufacturing contracted in August, fueling concern the
economic recovery is slowing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
