Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)  fell the most in 11
months after Evercore Partners Inc. downgraded the maker of
graphics processors to underweight from equal-weight, saying
2013 will be “challenging” for the company.  Nvidia dropped 5.4 percent to $13.28 at the New York close,
the biggest decline since Oct. 3.  The stock , which had risen 1.2
percent this year through Aug. 31, was among the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index’s biggest losers today.  Nvidia has bet on its Tegra mobile processor to boost
revenue, winning orders from  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  as
they push into the tablet market. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara,
California, could come under competitive pressure as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
prepares to introduce new versions of the iPad, wrote Evercore
analysts led by  Patrick Wang , in a note to clients today.  “If Tegra-based tablets are unable to gain traction
against Apple, Nvidia could be faced with an inventory glut in
the coming months,” the Evercore analysts wrote.  Additionally, Mountain View, California-based Google may
switch from using Nvidia’s Tegra 3 chip to Samsung Electronics
Co.’s Exynos 5 in its Nexus 10 tablet, according to the note.  Chris Caso, an analyst with Susquehanna International
Group, also downgraded Nvidia’s shares today to neutral from
positive, saying that recent checks indicate a “sharp
slowdown” in third-quarter notebook builds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
