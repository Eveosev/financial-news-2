Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , rose after a court in Budapest
deferred a verdict on whether a state-owned company can start a
competing mobile network operator.  The shares rose 1 percent to 426 forint by the close in
Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock index gained 0.9 percent to
17,756.87.  A group of state companies won the right in January to
start a mobile network competing with Magyar Telekom and units
of  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Telenor ASA. (TEL)  The three existing
providers appealed the results and the court yesterday deferred
its decision by another two weeks.  “Any generous delay would be a positive factor due to the
lack of increasing competition,”  Akos Kuti , a Budapest-based
analyst at broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in a research
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
