Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index poised for its longest losing streak in six
weeks, as the European Union’s outlook was cut by Moody’s
Investors Service ahead of policy makers’ meetings. Australian
shares declined as the central bank left the key rate unchanged.  Mobile phone maker  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , which gets 16
percent of its sales in Europe, fell 2.2 percent in Seoul.
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s second-biggest lender by
market value, slid 2.1 percent.  Agile Property Holdings (3383)  Ltd.
declined 4.7 percent in Hong Kong as its rating was cut at DBS
Vickers after its chairman was arrested.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.4 percent to 117.27 as
of 7:59 p.m. in Tokyo, headed for a four-day decline, the
longest streak since July 25. About 11 stocks dropped for every
seven that gained on the measure.  The  European Central Bank  “is more likely to trigger
action when they meet” in two days, said Matthew Sherwood,
Sydney-based head of markets research at Perpetual Investments,
which manages about $25 billion. “Whether it’s comprehensive
enough to keep sentiment strong and keep markets rallying is a
different issue because in the end there’s not much central
banks can do to address the global debt situation.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.4 percent this quarter
through yesterday as expectations for further stimulus measures
countered signs of a global economic slowdown. The Asian
benchmark traded at 12.3 times estimated earnings as of last
week, compared with 13.6 times for the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPXL1)  and 11.7 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  U.S. Manufacturing  Futures on the S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent today before a
report expected to show manufacturing teetered between growth
and contraction in August after shrinking in July. U.S. equity
markets were shut yesterday for a holiday.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei
225 Stock Average fell 0.1 percent. South Korea’s  Kospi index 
slid 0.3 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.2 percent.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.7 percent. The Shanghai
Composite Index lost 0.8 percent as Societe Generale SA cut its
forecast for China’s real gross domestic growth.  The European Union’s outlook was cut to negative from
stable by Moody’s, which came after ECB President  Mario Draghi 
told officials he would be comfortable buying three-year
 government bonds  to lower borrowing costs for nations in
financial distress.  The ECB may cut its benchmark  interest rate  to 0.5 percent
from 0.75 percent on Sept. 6, according to the median estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  European Talks  European leaders are stepping up shuttle diplomacy this
week in efforts to preserve the monetary union. EU President
 Herman Van Rompuy  is traveling to Berlin for talks with German
Chancellor Angela Merkel today as Italian Prime Minister  Mario
Monti  welcomes French President  Francois Hollande  to Rome.  LG Electronics fell 2.2 percent to 68,200 won. Shimano
Inc., a maker of bicycle parts that depends on Europe for 36
percent of its sales, dropped 2.4 percent to 5,590 yen in Osaka.  Banks led declines among shares in Sydney after the  Reserve
Bank  of Australia left the overnight cash-rate target at 3.5
percent as domestic demand weathers a global slowdown. Westpac
slid 2.1 percent to A$24.32 and  Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Australia’s third largest lender, dropped 2 percent
to A$24.34.  Agile Properties declined 4.7 percent to HK$8.21 after its
rating was cut to hold from buy at DBS. Chairman Chen Zhuo Lin
was arrested by police in  Hong Kong  in connection with an
allegation of indecent assault, the company said in a statement
on Aug. 31.  SouthGobi Resources Ltd., a coal producer in Mongolia
controlled by Rio Tinto Group, fell 6.5 percent to HK$19.02
after Aluminum Corp of China Ltd., also called Chalco, dropped
its C$925 million ($939 million) partial offer.  Chalco slid 0.3 percent to HK$2.91. The company’s initial
offer to buy a 60 percent stake in SouthGobi stalled in May when
Mongolia passed a law restricting foreign-state-owned companies
from controlling key assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
