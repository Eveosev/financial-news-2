The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities climbed 0.8 percent to 680.6599 at 4:31 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
gained 0.9 percent to 1,616.196.  CRUDE OIL  Oil climbed to the highest intraday price in more than a
week in  New York  on speculation central banks will take more
steps to boost economic growth, spurring demand for raw
materials.  Oil for October delivery increased as much as 88 cents to
$97.35 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest intraday price since Aug. 27, and was at
$96.91 at 8:53 a.m. London time. There was no floor trading
yesterday because of the U.S. Labor Day holiday, and
transactions since the Aug. 31 close will be booked with today’s
trades for settlement. Prices are 1.9 percent lower this year.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude was down 1 cent at $19.68 a barrel at 10:07 a.m.  Singapore 
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. , a broker.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, narrowed for
the fourth time in five days. Gasoil swaps for October rose
$1.33, or 1 percent, to $132.35 a barrel, PVM said. That’s the
highest since Aug. 23.  Naphtha swaps for October climbed $13, or 1.3 percent, to
$990.50 a metric ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical and
gasoline feedstock was the highest since April 30. Naphtha’s
premium to London-traded Brent crude futures gained $10.58 to
$115.80 a ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 12:32
p.m. Singapore time. The difference, also known as the crack
spread, was the widest in six days.  BASE METALS  Copper declined for the first time in three days after the
European Union’s outlook was cut to negative by Moody’s
Investors Service ahead of meetings of the region’s policy
makers today.  The metal for delivery in three months lost as much as 0.5
percent to $7,640 a metric ton before trading at $7,657.25 on
the  London  Metal Exchange at 3:10 p.m. Shanghai time.  Zinc and tin declined in London, while aluminum gained.
Lead and nickel were little changed.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold gained to the highest level in more than five months
as global data strengthened the case for more central-bank
measures to boost growth, increasing demand for the metal.
Silver climbed to the highest price since April.  Immediate-delivery gold rose as much as 0.3 percent to
$1,697.20 an ounce, the most expensive since March 13, and was
little changed at $1,694.18 at 2:26 p.m. in Singapore. Assets in
gold-backed exchange-traded products, which reached a record
2,460.462 metric tons on Aug. 29, stood at 2,459.963 tons on
Aug. 31, according to data tracked by Bloomberg.  Cash platinum rose for a third day, adding 0.5 percent to
$1,555.93 an ounce. Palladium also advanced for a third day,
increasing as much as 1.6 percent to $640.75 an ounce, and last
traded at $638.50.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans and the meal that’s crushed from the oilseed
gained to records in  Chicago  as drought in the U.S. cut global
supplies, and after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
hinted at extra stimulus. Corn and wheat advanced.  Soybeans for November-delivery rose as much as 1.9 percent
to $17.89 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and traded at
$17.84 at 1:48 p.m. in Singapore. Soybean-meal futures gained as
much as 1.4 percent to $540.80 per 2,000 pounds, and were at
$540.60. U.S. markets were closed for a holiday yesterday.  Corn for December delivery rose as much as 1.3 percent to
$8.0975 a bushel in Chicago and traded at $8.075. The price
reached a record $8.49 on Aug. 10. December-delivery wheat
gained as much as 1 percent to $8.9875 a bushel, taking most-
active gains this year to 38 percent.  Palm oil  climbed to the highest level in more than a week
on speculation that further monetary stimulus in the U.S. amid a
rally in soybeans to a record due to a drought will boost demand
for the tropical oil.  The November-delivery contract advanced as much as 0.9
percent to 3,100 ringgit ($999) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the highest level since Aug. 27, and was
at 3,079 ringgit at 11:38 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .  Rubber retreated from a one-week high after the European
Union’s economic outlook was cut by Moody’s Investors Service,
deepening concern that the region’s debt crisis will weaken
demand for the commodity used in tires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
