Beijing h ome sales  in August surged
110 percent from a year earlier driven by first-home buyers
after the central bank cut  interest rates  and signs of a price
rebound damped expectations for cheaper housing.  A total 28,753 new and existing homes were sold in the
Chinese capital in a “traditionally weak month,” 1.2 percent
lower than an 18-month high recorded in July, Centaline Property
Agency Ltd. said in a report e-mailed today.  China ’s new home prices rose for a third month in August,
adding to evidence of a rebound in sentiment as the government
signaled property curbs are working to stabilize prices,  SouFun
Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , the country’s biggest real estate website owner,
said yesterday. Expectations for rising sales are “strong”
this month and next, traditionally the big season for Chinese
developers, according to the Centaline.  “As the  property market  enters the ‘golden September and
silver October,’ developers are optimistic about sales going
forward,” Centaline, China’s biggest real-estate brokerage,
said in the report. Still, “home buyers’ willingness to buy is
wavering given expectations for price gains and banks vowing
strict stance on mortgage discounts.”  Almost 66 percent of the top 100 residential projects
monitored by Centaline in Beijing raised prices this year, which
led to a 26 percent decline in sales, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
