U.S. stocks retreated as a private
report showed American manufacturing industries contracted in
August, feuling concern the economic recovery is slowing.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,405.25 at 10:02 a.m. in New York.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
fell to 49.6 in August from 49.8 a month earlier, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said today. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
projected an August reading of 50, which is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction. Estimates from the 81
economists ranged from 48.7 to 51.5. The gauge averaged 55.2 in
2011 and 57.3 a year earlier.  Exchanges were closed yesterday in New York for the Labor
Day holiday. U.S. stocks rallied with commodities and Treasuries
on Aug. 31 as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he
wouldn’t rule out more stimulus to lower a jobless rate he
described as a “grave concern.”  The gain wasn’t enough for the  S&P 500  to avoid a second
straight weekly decline as concern over the global economic
recovery overshadowed the Fed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
