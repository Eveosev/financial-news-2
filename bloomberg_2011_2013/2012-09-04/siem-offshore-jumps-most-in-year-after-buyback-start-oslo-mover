Siem Offshore Inc. (SIOFF) , a Norwegian
offshore services company, rose the most in more than a year in
Oslo trading after announcing a share buyback.  The shares rose as much as 7.8 percent, the most since Aug.
10, 2011, and traded up 6.5 percent at 8.2 kroner as of 1:29
p.m., the fourth  largest gainer  on the Oslo All-Share Index.  “It’s very positive that they are willing to buy back
their own stock,” Petter Narvestad, an analyst at Fondsfinans
ASA, said by phone. “The share is trading at significant
discount to the break-up value of the company.” Siem Offshore
has a net asset value of about 15 kroner a share, he said.  The Kristiansand, Norway-based company said it will
repurchase as many as 10 million shares at as much as 10 kroner
($1.72) apiece, according to a statement today. The buyback
started today and will run until the company’s 2013 annual
general meeting at the latest, it said. About 300,000 shares had
traded as of 1:27 p.m., compared with a daily average of 184,000
over the past six months.  Siem Offshore, which was spun off from Subsea 7 Inc. in
2005, owns and operates a fleet of ships that services offshore
installations. Second-quarter sales grew 16 percent to $91
million from a year earlier, it said Aug. 23.  “It’s a company with a solid balance sheet so they
shouldn’t have any problems with either buybacks or dividends
and also investing in growth,” said Narvestad, who has a buy
rating on the stock and 12.5-krone price estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
