The euro-area  producer-price
inflation  rate held at a 2 1/2-year low in July as a deepening
economic slump made it more difficult for companies to pass on
higher costs.  Factory-gate prices  in the 17-nation euro region rose 1.8
percent from a year earlier, after a similar gain in June, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the weakest gain since March 2010. Economists had
forecast an increase of 1.6 percent, the median of 22 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey showed. From the prior month, July
prices gained 0.4 percent.  European companies are seeking ways to lower costs as
budget cuts discourage  consumer spending  and undermine export
demand. Euro-area unemployment held at 11.3 percent in July, the
highest on record, and economic confidence slumped in August,
adding to signs the economy may have slipped into a recession.  In  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, producer prices rose
0.9 percent from a year earlier, after increasing 1.6 percent in
the previous month, today’s data showed. Spain and Italy
reported quicker price growth.  Energy costs on the producer level advanced 4.8 percent in
July from a year earlier after rising 4.7 percent in the
previous month, the statistics office said. Annual price growth
of intermediate goods was unchanged and costs of capital goods
rose 1 percent.  The  European Central Bank , which in July cut its  benchmark
rate  to a record low 0.75 percent, will publish its updated
inflation projections when policy makers meet in  Frankfurt  on
Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
