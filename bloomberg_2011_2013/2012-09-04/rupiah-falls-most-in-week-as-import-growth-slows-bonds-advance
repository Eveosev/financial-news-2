Indonesia’s rupiah declined by the
most in more than a week after July exports contracted for a
fourth month and imports increased by the least since November
2009, signs  Europe ’s debt crisis is hurting the local economy.  Falling overseas shipments helped make the rupiah Asia’s
worst-performing currency last month as it dropped 1.5 percent.
Indonesia’s trade deficit narrowed to  $177 million , the smallest
since the nation last posted a surplus in March, as import
growth slowed to 0.75 percent from 11 percent in June, the
statistics bureau reported yesterday.  Government bonds  rose.  “The rupiah will continue to underperform regional
currencies,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-
Chinese Banking Corp. in  Singapore . “We may see the trade
deficit widen again.”  The rupiah weakened 0.3 percent to 9,589 per dollar as of
3:17 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest decline since Aug. 28,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. One-
month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings
used to price options, declined 75 basis points, or 0.75
percentage point, to 6.5 percent.  Exports decreased  7.3 percent  in July from a year earlier,
compared with a 16 percent contraction the previous month, the
government reported. The European Union accounts for 18 percent
of Indonesian exports. The trade shortfall reached $1.3 billion
in June.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.07
percent, the lowest level since Aug. 24, prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
