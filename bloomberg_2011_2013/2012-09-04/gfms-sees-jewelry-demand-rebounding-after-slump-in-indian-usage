Gold jewelry demand is set to
rebound in this yearâ€™s second half after a slump in Indian
consumption cut first-half usage to the lowest for the period
since 2009,  Thomson Reuters  GFMS said.  Global jewelry demand will increase 5.4 percent from a year
earlier to 952 metric tons in the second half, the London-based
 researcher  said today in a report. Consumption slid 13 percent
to 932 tons in the first half, the lowest since 2009, as Indian
usage plunged 30 percent to 279 tons, it said.  Indian demand slowed amid record local prices, strikes by
jewelers to protest taxes and a weakening economy, GFMS said.
Consumption in the six biggest western markets declined by a
combined 10 percent in the first half due to substitution to
other metals and weaker  consumer spending , the company said.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
financial and legal information and trading systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
