Japanese  shares  fell, with a fourth
day of declines on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average dragging the
gauge to its lowest in a month, after the European Union’s
outlook was cut by Moody’s Investors Service.  Shimano Inc. (7309) , a bicycle-parts maker that relies on Europe
for about a third of its revenue, declined 2.4 percent in  Osaka .
 Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s biggest oil explorer, advanced 0.9 percent
after Barclays Plc advised buying the shares and crude prices
rose to a week high. Toyota Motor Corp. sank 0.3 percent after
the automaker’s sales in China dropped 15 percent last month.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent to 8,775.51 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, the lowest since Aug. 6. Volume was 4.8
percent below the 30-day average. The broader Topix Index lost
0.3 percent to 726.69 after rising as much as 0.2 percent.  The  European Central Bank  “is more likely to trigger
action when they meet” in two days, said Matthew Sherwood,
Sydney-based head of markets research at Perpetual Investments,
which oversees about $25 billion. “Whether it’s comprehensive
enough to keep sentiment strong and keep markets rallying is a
different issue because in the end there’s not much central
banks can do to address the global debt situation.”  The Topix dropped 17 percent from this year’s peak on March
27 on concern Europe’s debt crisis is deepening as amid slowing
economic expansion in China and the U.S. The gauge trades at 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less
than one means companies can be bought for less than the value
of their assets.  Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.2 percent today ahead of
reports expected to show manufacturing growth in the world’s
biggest economy. The market was shut yesterday for a holiday.  Euro Stocks  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  slid 2.9 percent
to 20.09, indicating options traders are expecting a swing of
about 5.8 percent in the Nikkei 225 in the next 30 days.
Strategists are forecasting the measure will end the year at
10,400, according to the average of 15 surveyed by Bloomberg.  Companies that do business in Europe declined. Shimano lost
2.4 percent to 5,590 yen. Sysmex Corp., a medical equipment
maker that gets 30 percent of sales in Europe, retreated 2.5
percent to 3,525 yen.  The European Union’s outlook was cut to negative from
stable by Moody’s, which cited downside risks to France and
Germany, who shoulder the biggest cost of bailing out euro-zone
states.  Euro leaders are continuing their shuttle diplomacy this
week in efforts to save the single currency. EU President  Herman
Van Rompuy  is traveling to Berlin for talks with German
Chancellor Angela Merkel today as Italian Prime Minister  Mario
Monti  welcomes French President  Francois Hollande  to Rome.  Inpex Climbs  Energy stocks gained after crude for October delivery
climbed as much as 83 cents to $97.30 a barrel in electronic
trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the highest
intraday price since Aug. 27.  Inpex advanced 0.9 percent to 438,000 yen after the stock
