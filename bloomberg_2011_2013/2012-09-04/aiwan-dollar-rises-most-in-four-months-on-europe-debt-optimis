Taiwan ’s dollar advanced for a third
day on bets the European  Central bank  will announce details of
its new bond-buying plan, boosting optimism that policy makers
will succeed in containing the region’s debt crisis.  The currency was trading 0.3 percent stronger one minute to
the market-close before speculation of a central bank
intervention trimmed gains, according to two traders who asked
not to be identified. Official data to be released tomorrow may
show Taiwan’s consumer prices rose 2.6 percent in August from a
year earlier, the fastest pace since 2008, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “The market is hoping for the ECB bond-buying plan to
materialize,” said Ma Tieying, an economist at DBS Group
Holdings Ltd. in  Singapore .  “Consumer prices should remain
high in the third quarter due to the typhoon season.”  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.902
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
rose as much as 0.4 percent earlier and touched NT$29.815, the
strongest level since Aug. 10.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell 21 basis points to 3.6
percent. The  overnight money-market rate  was steady at 0.39
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  Taiwan cut its 2012 economic growth forecast last month to
1.66 percent from 2.08 percent, after gross domestic product
shrank more than initially estimated in the second quarter.
Export orders fell 4.39 percent in July from a year earlier, a
fifth straight monthly decline, data showed Aug. 20.  The currency’s one-month non-deliverable forwards closed
0.1 percent higher at NT$29.805 per dollar, indicating the spot
rate may strengthen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ECB Bond Buying  ECB President  Mario Draghi  told lawmakers in Brussels
yesterday he would be comfortable buying bonds with maturities
of up to about three years, said Jean-Paul Gauzes, a member of
the European Parliament.  Global funds sold $42.9 million more local stocks than they
bought today, trimming this year’s net purchases to $722
million, according to exchange data.  Typhoon Tembin caused at least NT$72.9 million ($2.4
million) worth of agricultural damage on the island in August as
the storm tore through farming facilities and crops.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on Taiwan’s
1.125 percent notes due September 2022 was at 1.169 percent from
1.167 percent yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
