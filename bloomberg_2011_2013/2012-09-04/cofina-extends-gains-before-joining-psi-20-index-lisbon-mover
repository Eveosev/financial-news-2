Cofina SGPS SA (CFN)  rose for a fourth day
to close at the highest level in almost eight months, as the
Portuguese news publisher prepares to join the country’s
benchmark PSI-20 stock index on Sept. 24.  The  stock  climbed 17 percent to 70 euro cents, the highest
price since Jan. 19. Cofina has almost doubled since the NYSE
Euronext Lisbon exchange announced on Aug. 29 that the publisher
would join the index.  Cofina, founded in 1995, has five newspapers, including
financial daily Jornal de Negocios, and nine magazines in
 Portugal . The biggest shareholders include Credit Suisse AG,
Caderno Azul SPS and Newshold SGPS, according to  data compiled 
by Bloomberg.  The stock may rise to 76 cents before joining the index,
according to  Pedro Oliveira , a trader at Go Bulling in Lisbon.
“Then we will see if it has enough strength to continue to
rise.”  Cofina reported second-quarter revenue on Aug. 30 that beat
analysts’ estimates. Sales fell 9.3 percent in the period to
29.7 million euros ($37.4 million).  Cofina and  Banif SGPS SA (BNF) , a Portuguese lender, will join
the PSI-20 index as part of a quarterly review, the NYSE
Euronext Lisbon said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
