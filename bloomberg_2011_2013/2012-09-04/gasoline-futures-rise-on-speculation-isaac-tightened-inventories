Gasoline and heating oil futures
fell as U.S. Gulf Coast refineries came back online after
Hurricane Isaac, boosting supply, and a contraction in U.S.
manufacturing indicated oil demand may shrink.  Futures sank after Valero Energy Corp. and Phillips 66
started three refineries, the last three plants remaining shut
because of Hurricane Isaac. West Texas Intermediate crude oil
fell $1.17 to settle at $95.30 a barrel after the Institute of
Supply Management’s factory index fell to 49.6 in August.  “The refineries coming back online, coupled with the fact
that oil has fallen off on weak economic data, has shaken off
some of the disappointment we saw earlier,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “Those
refineries made a lot of progress in the last six hours.”  October-delivery gasoline fell 2.06 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $2.9522 a gallon on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Prices climbed 6.6 percent last month.  The ISM sank to the lowest level since July 2009, from 49.8
a month earlier. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had projected
an August reading of 50, which is the dividing line between
expansion and contraction.  Valero started its Norco and Meraux refineries, and
Phillips 66 started its Alliance plant. Hurricane Isaac shut
seven refineries in  Louisiana  with 1.4 million barrels a day of
combined capacity and caused three others to reduce rates.  Hedge Funds  Futures touched $3.0032 a gallon earlier on speculation the
refinery outages would persist, reducing fuel supplies. Gasoline
inventories probably declined 3 million barrels last week, the
median of nine estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Hedge funds  increased net-long positions in gasoline, or
wagers on rising prices, by 3 percent in the seven days ended
Aug. 28, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report on Aug. 31. Bullish bets climbed
2,124 to 72,571 in the week ended Aug. 28, the CFTC data show.
It’s the highest level since the week ended May 1.  Money managers raised bullish bets on heating oil, a proxy
for diesel, for a ninth consecutive week. Net-long wagers
advanced 4,352 futures and options combined, or 23 percent, to
23,083, the highest level since the week ended May 8, the CFTC
report showed.  Heating oil for October delivery fell 3.34 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $3.1468 a gallon on the exchange. Futures
gained 12 percent in August, the biggest monthly rise since
September 2010.  Venezuela ’s Amuay oil refinery, the country’s largest, will
return to full capacity in “days” after restarting some
distillation units following a fatal gas explosion on Aug. 25,
Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said. The shutdown had tightened the
global supply of oil products, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the
Paris-based  International Energy Agency , told reporters in  New
Delhi  today.  “If they can get that plant back online, it’s going to
present a huge sigh of relief to the region,” Flynn said.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.3
cent to $3.824 yesterday, AAA data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
