Brazilian pension fund Funcef plans
to increase its stake in the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam to 10
percent from 6.25 percent, its president said.  “We decided to increase our participation,” Funcef
President Carlos Caser told reporters in Brasilia today. The
fund plans to acquire shares owned by construction company
Barueri, Brazil-based Engevix Engenharia SA, Caser said.  The move would double the fund’s total investment in the
Belo Monte dam to about 600 million reais ($294 million),
investment chief Mauricio Marcellini said today at the same
event. The purchase requires final approval by Funcef’s
governing council.  Funcef is the pension fund for workers at  Brazil ’s state-
controlled bank Caixa Economica Federal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
