Spain’s bank-rescue fund will inject
government bonds, not cash, into  Bankia (BKIA)  group to recapitalize
the lender while it awaits European bailout funds.  FROB, as the country’s bank rescue fund is known, will
receive the bonds from the country’s treasury before
transferring them to Bankia’s parent, according to an official
at the Economy ministry, who asked not to be named in line with
government policy. Bankia’s parent will recapitalize its listed
unit by extending a subordinated loan, he said.  Spain is bolstering Bankia group after the nationalized
lender posted a 4.45 billion-euro ($5.6 billion) first-half
loss. Bankia requested in May 19 billion euros in state aid
following a 4.5 billion-euro bailout in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
