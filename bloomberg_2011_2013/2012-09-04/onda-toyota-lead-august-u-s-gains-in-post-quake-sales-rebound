Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  led U.S. sales gains in August amid the industry’s
strongest month since 2009, reclaiming market share lost a year
earlier because of  Japan ’s natural disasters.  Honda, Japan’s third-largest carmaker, posted an increase
of 60 percent yesterday, compared with the 59 percent average of
seven analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Toyota’s sales
rose 46 percent, compared with a 40 percent average projection.
Nissan Motor Co.’s deliveries grew 7.6 percent, short of the 12
percent average estimate.  Toyota and Honda “didn’t go crazy on incentives, which
were in check compared to last year,” said  Jesse Toprak , an
analyst at TrueCar.com, an automotive pricing and data company
in Santa Monica,  California . “They stayed fairly aggressive
where they needed to, particularly Honda with the Accord as it
gets ready to launch the new model.”  Their gains contributed to a 14.5 million seasonally
adjusted annualized sales  rate  for cars and light trucks,
according to researcher Autodata Corp. That was the fastest pace
since August 2009, when the U.S. government offered incentives
to exchange older vehicles for new, more fuel-efficient models.
Last month’s rate also beat the 14.2 million average of 15
analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Honda was pushing to boost Accord sales as the Tokyo-based
carmaker prepares to sell a revamped version this month and as
competition grows with Toyota’s Camry, a new Nissan Altima and
the September arrival of Ford Motor Co.’s redesigned Fusion.
Updated models have helped make midsize cars the biggest vehicle
segment this year.  Accord sales surged 89 percent in August to 34,848, second
to Toyota’s Camry at 36,720. Nissan’s Altima was third with
25,889.  Industry Gains  Industrywide sales of midsize models rose 26 percent in
August and 22 percent to 2.52 million vehicles this year,
according to Autodata. Total car and light-truck sales rose 20
percent last month to 1.29 million, according to the  Woodcliff
Lake , New Jersey-based research firm.  “People are inspired by the glut of new product in the
market,” said Jessica Caldwell, an industry analyst for
Edmunds.com, an auto pricing and data website in  Santa Monica .
“Especially since they are in the position to get rid of their
ailing older vehicles.”  Among U.S.-based carmakers, sales rose 10 percent at
 General Motors Co. (GM) , 13 percent at Ford and 14 percent at
Chrysler Group LLC.  Honda rose 1.4 percent to 2,506 yen at 9:23 a.m. in Tokyo
trading, while Toyota climbed 1.5 percent to 3,125 yen. Nissan
fell 1.1 percent to 728 yen.  Market Share  Japanese and South Korean automakers sold a combined
586,227 light vehicles last month, 45.6 percent of new vehicle
sales, according to Autodata. Market share for the U.S.-based
companies was 45.3 percent on 581,591 deliveries.  Sales of cars rose 28 percent to 650,576, topping the gain
of 13 percent to 634,626 for light trucks, Autodata reported.  Sales of cars, which typically have higher  fuel efficiency 
than trucks, may have gained in part because August’s national
average price for regular unleaded gasoline climbed 8.7 percent,
the biggest  monthly increase  since April 2011, to $3.83 a gallon,
according to AAA, the biggest U.S. motorist group.  Toyota,  Asia ’s largest automaker, reported August sales of
188,520 Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles, up from 129,483 a year
earlier. The Toyota City, Japan-based company is running North
American factories at the fastest pace in five years to increase
supplies of Camrys, Corolla small cars and RAV4 compact sport-
utility vehicles.  Lexus Prevails  The Lexus luxury brand had a 34 percent increase to push
its sales past both Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s BMW and
Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz for the first time since December
2010.  The addition of the new ES and GS sedans helped Lexus boost
deliveries to 24,237, Tim Morrison, the brand’s vice president
for U.S. sales, told reporters on a conference call yesterday.  “ES was the last big one that we were waiting for,” he
said of the sedan, which was introduced in late July.  Combined sales for the Prius hybrid line also contributed
to Toyota’s gains, more than doubling to 21,111.  The automaker’s market share was 14.7 percent last month,
up from 12.1 percent a year earlier, according to Autodata.
Toyota and Honda both lost sales and market share last year as
Japan’s March 2011 earthquake and tsunami crimped production.  Honda, fifth in the U.S. by sales volume, delivered 131,321
vehicles to customers in August, up from 82,321. Along with the
Accord’s gains, sales more than doubled for the Civic small car
and climbed 44 percent for the CR-V crossover. The Civic and CR-
V are the top sellers in their segments.  The company’s Acura luxury line posted a 73 percent gain,
led by increases for MDX and RDX sport-utility vehicles.  ‘Extraordinary’ Deals  “This has been a great time for people to buy cars because
the deals in the past month have been extraordinary,”  Maryann Keller , principal of Maryann Keller & Associates, a consulting
firm in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said today on the “Bloomberg
Surveillance” television show.  Dealers are “anxious to get rid of the 2012 Civics and
2012 Accords because they’ve got new models coming into
showrooms now,” Keller said.  Honda spent an average of $2,419 a vehicle on incentives,
up 7.7 percent from a year ago, and just below the industry’s
$2,478 average, according to Autodata. Toyota’s average was
$1,934 and Nissan’s was $2,762, Autodata said.  The rise in Honda’s incentives in recent months came mainly
from spending for the 2012 Accord,  John Mendel , the company’s
U.S. executive vice president, said in an Aug. 23 interview.
That includes discounted lease offers and 0.9 percent financing
for as long as 60 months, according to Honda’s website. The
arrival of the 2013 Accord this month will bring a reduction in
that spending, Mendel said.  The company’s basic view with regard to incentives is
“we’re not going to do anything stupid,” he said. “The bottom
line is if it’s higher than zero, it’s higher than we want it.”  Honda’s market share in August was 10.2 percent, up from
7.7 percent a year earlier, Autodata said.  Nissan, Hyundai  Nissan deliveries rose to 98,515 last month from 91,541 a
year earlier. The company got a boost from Sentra and Versa
small cars and luxury Infiniti JX crossovers and GS cars, as
well as the Altima.  Nissan’s market share was 7.7 percent last month, down from
8.5 percent as the Yokohama, Japan-based company’s sales gain
trailed the industry’s.  South Korea ’s  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and affiliate  Kia Motors
Corp. (000270)  combined to sell 11 percent more vehicles in August than a
year earlier. That was less than the 19 percent average estimate
of five analysts.  Hyundai, which increased sales 4.4 percent to 61,099, said
in a statement that deliveries of Sonata and Genesis sedans
slipped in August from a year earlier. Kia’s sales of the Optima
sedan more than doubled to 13,949, as the company’ total rose 21
percent to 50,028, according to a statement.  Subaru, the auto brand of Japan’s  Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd. (7270) , had a 36 percent increase in August deliveries while those
at  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  fell 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
