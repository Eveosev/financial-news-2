Cat Power’s new CD is called “Sun.”  Power has been in love with  Memphis  for years. Surprisingly
through, the title isn’t a reference to Sun Studios of Elvis Presley fame.  Charlyn Marshall -- who found her stage name when she met a
man with a “Cat Diesel Power” cap -- is known for her lush
production, with everything drenched in Memphis horns.  The music on the new disc does indeed shine. Power started
work on it immediately after the release of its predecessor,
“The Greatest,” in 2006. (There was a cover-version album in the
intervening years.)  This time, the songs are stripped down to overdubs and drum
machines, with the title track an electronic chug while she
salutes freedom. Rating: ****.  Like so many others, I’ve been aghast about  Russia  after
the jail sentences handed out to Pussy Riot members for their
church protest. The mild “crime” and excessive punishment say
much about censorship in Vladimir Putin’s country. The incident
also raises the question of whether they are any good.  With only a few songs, clunky riffs and sub- Yoko Ono 
yelling, it’s sad to report the group has a long way to go.
Perhaps its sole misdemeanor is the choice of name. Rating: *.  On the other hand, Mumiy Troll’s musicians can play their
instruments and have some clever songs.  The new album “Vladivostock,” named after the act’s home
city, includes the catchy “Hey Tovarish.” It sounds like Rolling
Stones meeting Status Quo for a vodka-fueled jam session.  The only bad point is a press release which says Mumiy
Troll is the most dangerous band in Russia. As described by a
Communist Party official. Though rule No. 1 of rock goes like
this: If you say you are dangerous, you probably aren’t.  Pussy Riot at least sounds a lot more scary. Rating: ***.  Mark Knopfler is continuing to make understated rock, laced
with economically beautiful guitar solos. “Privateering,” his
seventh CD after Dire Straits, is getting ever more bluesy. The
20 songs are spread over two discs, with “Kingdom of Gold” and
“Radio City Serenade” the highlights. Rating: ***.  Dave Stewart  is also embracing Memphis blues and Nashville
on “The Ringmaster General.” The former Eurythmics star forges 
some impressive collaborations with Joss Stone, Alison Krauss 
and Diane Birch. Rating: ****.  Only fans will probably fully appreciate the new Elbow CD, 
right from its title “Dead in the Boot” -- a reference to the 
previous “Asleep in the Back.” It's a downbeat B-sides 
compilation, led off by the long-forgotten “Whisper Grass.” 
Rating: ***.  Cat Power is on Matador, Mumiy Troll on Village, Mark
Knopfler on Universal import (out in the U.K. now and in the
U.S. on Sept. 11), Dave Stewart on Surfdog Records and 
Elbow on Polydor import.  Download fees vary across services. The albums are priced
from about $12 in the U.S. and 9 pounds in the U.K.  Information:  http://www.catpowermusic.com ,
