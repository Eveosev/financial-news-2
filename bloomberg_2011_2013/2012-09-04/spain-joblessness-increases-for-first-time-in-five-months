 Spanish  registered unemployment 
rose in August for the first time in five months amid a
worsening  recession .  The number of people registering for jobless benefits rose
38,179 from July to 4.63 million, according to data released
today by the  Labor Ministry  in  Madrid . That compares with an
increase of 51,185 in the same month last year.  The euro area’s fourth-largest economy contracted for a
third quarter in the three months through June, pushing the
European Union’s highest  unemployment  rate to 24.6 percent, a
record in the country’s 36 years of democratic history.  Economists contradict Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s
forecast that unemployment has peaked at a quarter of the
workforce. The proportion of jobless will rise to 26.1 percent
in 2013, according to the median of nine forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
