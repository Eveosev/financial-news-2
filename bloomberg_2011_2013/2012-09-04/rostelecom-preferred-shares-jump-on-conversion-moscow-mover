Preferred shares of OAO Rostelecom,
 Russia ’s dominant long-distance phone operator, surged to the
highest level in more than three months as the board plans to
discuss converting them into common stock.  Rostelecom preferred shares gained 3.1 percent to 88.95
rubles by 4:08 p.m. in Moscow, the highest intraday level since
May 24. The stock jumped as much as 4.1 percent earlier. The
ordinary shares were little changed at 125.37 rubles.  The board will hold preliminary talks and review a
presentation by  Renaissance Capital  about the possible
conversion on Sept. 6, Kira Kiryukhina, a Rostelecom
spokeswoman, said by phone today.  “We believe the preferred shares offer the best exposure
to Rostelecom’s strong fundamental prospects as they are traded
at a 31 percent discount to commons,” Uralsib Capital analysts
led by Konstantin Chernyshev said in an e-mailed note. The bank
reiterated its buy recommendation on preferred and common shares
today.  Rostelecom’s preferred shares trade at 6.4 times  estimated
earnings , compared with 9.1 times for its ordinary shares. The
preferred stock has lost about 6.6 percent this year.  Second-quarter profit rose 3 percent from a year earlier to
8.8 billion rubles, according to Rostelecom’s Aug. 30 report,
exceeding analyst estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
