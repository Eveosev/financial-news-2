Iryna Ivaschenko, the International
Monetary Fund’s representative in  Hungary , comments on the
Washington-based lender’s proposals for the country’s
government.  She commented in an e-mailed reply to questions from
Bloomberg yesterday.  On whether Hungary needs to enact more austerity measures:  “We are not looking for more fiscal adjustment beyond what
the government is already planning, there is no more austerity
in our proposals. But we think the adjustment can be achieved
with more balanced measures, and more generally, we are looking
for policies that can boost growth.”  On whether the IMF will discuss with Hungary a  credit line  more
flexible than a Stand-by Agreement:  “Our Stand-by Arrangements could be treated as
precautionary by the government.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
