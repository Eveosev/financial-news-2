Two Coptic Christian boys were
arrested and detained by Egyptian authorities for insulting
Islam after accusations they had torn up pages of the Koran.  Nabil Rizk, 10, and Mina Farag, nine, have been held in a
juvenile detention facility in Upper  Egypt  since yesterday
pending further investigation, Ishak Ibrahim, head of religious
freedom at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said by
phone today. A resident went to the police station accusing the
boys of tearing up papers, included Koranic verses.  The boys have been detained, according to a faxed statement
today from the Egyptian prosecutor in the town of Beni Suef.  A Coptic schoolteacher in Sohag was sentenced last month to
six years in prison for posting cartoons deemed defamatory to
Islam and the  Prophet Muhammad  on his Facebook account.  More than 18 cases of religious defamation have been filed
since the uprising that ousted  Hosni Mubarak  last year, Ibrahim
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
