Australia  will play four Test matches
on its rugby union tour to  Europe  in November and December.  The Wallabies open their tour Nov. 10 against  France  in
Paris before facing England, Italy and  Wales  on successive
Saturdays, the Australian Rugby Union said today.  The squad will be announced in late October. Australia
hosts world champion New Zealand on Oct. 20 in the third and
final Bledisloe Cup match in Brisbane. The All Blacks already
retained the trophy for a 10th straight series by winning both
meetings between the teams in the inaugural Rugby Championship.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
