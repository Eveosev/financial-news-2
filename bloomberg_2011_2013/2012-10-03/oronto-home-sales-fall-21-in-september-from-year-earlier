The volume of home sales in Toronto,
 Canada ’s largest city, fell 21 percent in September from the
same month last year, realtor data shows.  The number of homes sold in the Greater Toronto Area fell
to 5,879 from 7,422, the data show, while the average price rose
more than 8.5 percent to C$503,662 ($510,335), the Toronto Real
Estate Board said in an e-mailed statement.  “While sales have been lower due to stricter mortgage
lending guidelines, we continue to see substantial competition
between buyers,” said board President Ann Hannah in the
statement. “The months of inventory trend remains low from a
historic perspective, which explains the strong price increases
we are experiencing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
