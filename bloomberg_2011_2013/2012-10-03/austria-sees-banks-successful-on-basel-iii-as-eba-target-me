Austria ’s Central Bank said it
expects the nation’s lenders to meet capital rules set by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision after  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) 
and Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG beat targets set by
the European Banking Authority.  “The Austrian banks have shown that they can quickly
strengthen their capital base significantly without restricting
the supply of credit,” Central Bank Director  Andreas Ittner 
said in a  statement  today. “This supports my expectation that
the Austrian banking sector also will succeed in additional
capital strengthening related to Basel III.”  Erste had a capital ratio of 9.9 percent according to the
EBA definition at the end of June, while RZB’s ratio was 10
percent, the banks said in separate statements. That means they
both exceeded the EBA’s target of 9 percent of risk-weighted
assets.  Erste previously had a shortfall of 743 million euros ($960
million) and RZB of 2.13 billion euros, according to an EBA
stress test looking at third-quarter numbers in 2011.  Erste filled the gap mostly with retained earnings, while
RZB predominately sold assets and converted capital into forms
accepted by the EBA.  The new Basel rules, known as Basel III, are scheduled to
be phased in by 2019.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
