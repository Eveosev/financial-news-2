Nikola Karabatic, the best-known
player on  France ’s Olympic champion handball team, has denied
betting on a match involving his club, while saying that his
girlfriend did.  French prosecutors have charged Karabatic, his girlfriend,
his brother Luka and 8 other people for betting on a May 12 game
between his Montpellier team and Cesson-Sevigne, Agence France-
Presse reported, citing lawyers for the accused. Montpellier
lost 31-28.  Montpellier prosecutor Brice Robin said in a Oct. 1 press
conference that 87,880 euros ($113,500) of bets were placed,
earning 252,880 euros. The bets were placed in lots of 100
euros, allowing winning to be picked up anonymously.  On his Facebook page, Karabatic said he was living a
“nightmare” and that his girlfriend’s betting on a Cesson
victory didn’t constitute fraud. He said she “knew our
situation well,” which was that Montpellier had already
clinched the French championship, had five major players
injured, and Cesson needed to win to remain in the major league.  Karabatic and his brother didn’t play in the Cesson
game. “To accuse me of cheating and fixing a game is
intolerable,” he wrote.  Karabatic, 28, was born in  Serbia  and has lived in France
since he was four. He played on the French national team that
won the Olympic gold medal in 2008 and 2012, and the world
championship in 2009 and 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
