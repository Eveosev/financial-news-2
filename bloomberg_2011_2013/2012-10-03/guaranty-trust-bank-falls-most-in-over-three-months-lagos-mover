Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) ,  Nigeria ’s
biggest lender by market value, fell the most in more than three
months after the stock reached a record high yesterday.  The shares dropped 4.2 percent to 20.11 naira by the close
in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, the biggest decline
since June 21. Guaranty advanced 9.6 percent yesterday, reaching
20.98 naira, the highest since at least January 2002, when
Bloomberg began tracking the stock.  “Guaranty overshot the 20 naira psychological price
yesterday so we expected investors to begin to harvest their
gains today,” Abiola Rasaq, a Lagos-based analyst at Vetiva
Capital Management Ltd., said by phone today. “We see the stock
stabilizing at between 19.20 naira and 19.30 naira” by year-
end, he said.  The  Nigerian Stock Exchange  chose Guaranty and 15 other
stocks as trial securities in market-making activities that
began Sept. 18. The bourse raised their daily price movement
limit to 10 percent, from the 5 percent that applies for all
other stocks.  First-half profit at Guaranty jumped 66 percent to 45
billion naira ($286 million), the lender said Aug. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
