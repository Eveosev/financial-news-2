Ethanol futures rose a fourth day in
 Chicago  as losses from making the fuel caused producers to
reduce output.  Prices extended the longest streak of gains since July 18
after an Energy Department report showed  production  tumbled 3
percent last week to 785,000 barrels a day, the least since the
agency began publishing weekly data in June 2010.  “There’s no margin there,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone Group in  Des Moines , Iowa. “The
market needed to adjust. We had burdensome supply and the
market’s starting to take note of that and is responding.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery climbed 1.8 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to settle at $2.39 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest price since Sept. 14. The futures have
jumped 8.5 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf advanced 5
cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.42 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive jumped 4.75 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.3625, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.49 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel increased 2 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.455.  Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish engineering and renewable energy
company, said this week it will temporarily idle a Madison,
 Illinois , ethanol plant, for maintenance and on unprofitable
returns.  That followed  Biofuel Energy Corp.’s (BIOF)  Sept. 24 decision to
shut its 115 million-gallon-a-year plant in Fairmont,  Minnesota .  Blackford said he expects “some more contraction” as
producers wrestle with higher-than-normal corn costs, caused by
the most severe U.S. drought in 56 years.  Corn Declines  Corn for December delivery fell 1.5 cents to $7.5675 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, plants
are losing about 35 cents on each gallon of the biofuel
produced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t
include profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Gasoline for November delivery tumbled 6.97 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.7995 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The motor fuel narrowed its  premium  to ethanol to 40.95
cents, the smallest gap since Sept. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
