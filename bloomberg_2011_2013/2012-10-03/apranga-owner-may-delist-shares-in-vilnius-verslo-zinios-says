Apranga AB (APG1L) , the biggest Baltic
clothing retailer, may be delisted from  Lithuania â€˜s Nasdaq OMX
Vilnius stock exchange, Verslo Zinios newspaper reported, citing
majority owner Darius Mockus.  Mockus, through other companies he owns, controls more than
60 percent of shares in Vilnius-based Apranga, the newspaper
said. Since Aug. 29, he has bought Apranga shares through
another company for about 350,000 euros ($451,000) in 10 trades,
including the purchase of a stake from Swedish asset manager
East Capital for 200,000 euros, Verslo Zinios reported.  Mockus is dissatisfied by listing restrictions on his
status as an investor and is considering ending public trading
in Vilnius, Verslo Zinios said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
