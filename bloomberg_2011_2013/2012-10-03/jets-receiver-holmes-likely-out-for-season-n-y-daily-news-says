New York Jets wide receiver  Santonio Holmes  will probably miss the remainder of the National Football
League season with a left foot injury, the New York Daily News
reported.  Holmes, who has a team-high 20 catches for 272 yards this
season, suffered a Lisfranc injury, or displaced bones in the
mid-foot, in a 34-0 loss to the  San Francisco 49ers  three days
ago, the newspaper said.  The injury happened a week after All-Pro cornerback
 Darrelle Revis  was ruled out for the season with a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee.  Holmes was injured when his left leg buckled without
contact on a reception in the fourth quarter. Carlos Rogers
returned the fumble 51 yards for a touchdown. Revisâ€™s injury
also came without contact when he tried to change direction and
make a tackle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
