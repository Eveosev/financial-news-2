The French state-owned bank Caisse
des Depots et Consignations plans to raise its stake in  Veolia
Environnement ’s Transdev transport venture to 60 percent from 50
percent with the water utility retaining a 40 percent holding,
Le Figaro said, citing unidentified people.  Veolia spokeswoman Marie-Claire Camus declined to comment
and a spokesman at Paris-based CDC wasn’t immediately available
for comment today on the report, part of the French water
company’s debt restructuring plan and asset disposal strategy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
