Palm oil gained for the first time in
six days as a slump to the lowest level in almost three years
widened its discount to  soybean oil , spurring demand from
importers for food and fuel.  The December-delivery contract advanced as much as 4.5
percent to 2,357 ringgit ($770) a metric ton on the  Malaysia 
Derivatives Exchange and was at 2,350 ringgit at 4:54 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures earlier fell to 2,230 ringgit, the lowest
level for the most-active month since November 2009. Futures
have slumped 23 percent since the end of August.  Palm oil has plunged as a global economic slowdown hurt
demand for the oil used in everything from candy to biofuel amid
a seasonal increase in production in  Indonesia  and Malaysia, the
world’s largest producers. Stockpiles in Malaysia may have
jumped to 2.6 million tons at the end of September, Ivy Ng, an
analyst at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd., wrote in a report today.  “The selldown of crude  palm oil  may be overdone based on
fundamentals, and the price decline should be sufficient to
attract demand,” CIMB’s Ng said. “Palm oil is at an attractive
discount to soybean oil and is increasingly attractive as a
biodiesel feedstock.”  Soybean oil’s  premium  over the tropical oil reached $378.98
a ton yesterday, the most since September 2008. Soybean oil and
palm oil are used in foods and fuels.  Soybean oil for December delivery dropped 1.1 percent to
50.16 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November delivery lost 1.5 percent to $15.0825 a bushel.  Record Reserves  Reserves in Malaysia may be at 2.43 million tons, Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd., wrote in
a report today. Inventories reached an all-time high of 2.27
million tons in November 2008, according to the Malaysian Palm
Oil Board. The board is scheduled to release data for last month
on Oct. 10.  Indonesia’s exports may fall to 1.52 million tons this
month from an estimated 1.63 million tons in September as buyers
may hold orders because of falling prices, said Sahat Sinaga,
 executive director  at the Indonesian Vegetable Oil Industry
Association.  “Buyers may seek to renegotiate their long-term
contracts,” Sinaga said. “It’s hard to take positions with
such a drop in prices.”  Monthly palm oil output may remain high until early 2013,
says Susanto, head of marketing at Indonesia Palm Oil
Association. Production may exceed 25 million tons this year, he
said. Prices are poised to fall further as stockpiles climb in
 Asia  and exports remain weak, said Susanto.  First Resources Ltd. (FR)  dropped as much as 7.3 percent to
S$1.900 and Golden Agri-Resources Ltd. fell as much as 3.8
percent to S$0.630 in Singapore trading today, leading declines
in Asian palm oil producers.  Sime Darby Bhd., (SIME)  the biggest listed
palm oil producer, lost as much as 5.1 percent to 9.24 ringgit
in  Kuala Lumpur .  To contact the reporter on this story:
