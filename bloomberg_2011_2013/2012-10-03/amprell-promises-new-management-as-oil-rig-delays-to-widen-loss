Lamprell Plc (LAM) , the oil-rig engineer
suffering project delays, plunged to the lowest in 3-1/2 years
in  London  after saying its 2012 loss will be wider than forecast
and it will make changes to its senior management.  The company slumped 36 percent to 70 pence, the lowest
level since April 2009. Lamprell will announce details of
leadership changes in the “near term,” it said in a statement.  Delays to the Windcarrier project led to additional costs,
while a holdup on a separate development will stall some sales
and earnings until next year, said the Douglas, Isle of Man-
based company, whose main facilities are in Dubai. Lamprell
forecast in August a full-year loss of as much as $17 million.  Chief Executive Officer Nigel McCue had pledged to revamp
Lamprell after unexpected delays to projects since May drove
down its share price. The company didn’t give an update today on
talks with banks after receiving waivers on loans at the end of
June. Lamprell said Aug. 28 it would have to negotiate with
lenders again to avoid breaking loan conditions at the year-end.  “I am extremely disappointed in the need to make this
latest trading update and feel that a refreshed management team
will bring a more focused sense of delivery,” Chairman  John Kennedy  said. “Fundamentals of the business continue to be
sound and the order book and new contract pipeline remain
strong.” Kennedy, a former executive at  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  and
Wellstream Holdings Plc, started as chairman three months ago.  The order book stands at about $1.5 billion, Lamprell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
