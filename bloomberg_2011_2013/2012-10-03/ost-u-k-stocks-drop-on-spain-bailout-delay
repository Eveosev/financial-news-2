U.K. stocks  advanced after a report
showed companies in the U.S. added more workers to payrolls in
September than economists had predicted.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  rose 2.5 percent a day
after Vanguard Group Inc. selected the  FTSE Group  to provide
indexes for its international funds.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  fell 2.6 percent
as it posting its first drop in profit in almost two decades.
 FirstGroup Plc (FGP)  slumped 21 percent as the government stripped the
company of the West Coast rail franchise.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 16.36 points, or 0.3 percent, to
5,825.81 at the close in London, before the monthly U.S.
payrolls report on Oct. 5. The equity benchmark dropped 1.9
percent last week as Germany and France disagreed on when to
start a banking union in the euro area and concern grew that the
latest round of U.S. stimulus will fail to encourage economic
growth. The FTSE All-Share Index advanced 0.2 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 0.4 percent.  “The encouraging thing is that even if the Europeans can’t
get their houses in order, the world’s biggest economy is in
good shape, creating jobs and growing which is good for the
globally exposed stocks of the FTSE 100,” said  Angus Campbell ,
head of market analysis at Capital Spreads in London. “This
bodes well for this Friday’s non-farm payroll.”  In the U.S., the ADP Employer Services report showed
private employers hired 162,000 workers in September, from a
revised 189,000 jump in August. The median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg had called for an increase of
140,000 workers.  Services Industry  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  non-manufacturing
index , which covers almost 90 percent of the economy, rose to
55.1 in September from 53.7 the previous month. That exceeded
the 53.4  median estimate  of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Spain has no plans to ask for a bailout soon, Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said in Madrid yesterday after the close
of trading.  In China, an  index  that surveys purchasing managers in non-
manufacturing industries fell to 53.7 in September from 56.3 in
August, the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing said in Beijing today.  LSE advanced 2.5 percent to 980 pence. MSCI Inc. slumped 27
percent in  New York  trading yesterday. Vanguard, the largest
U.S. mutual-fund provider, said yesterday it will use FTSE’s
equity benchmarks rather than those from MSCI for six
international stock-index funds.  EasyJet, Dunelm  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  climbed 3.5 percent to 615 pence, its highest
price since January 2008, after predicting full-year pretax
profit of at least 310 million pounds ($498 million). Europe’s
second-biggest discount airline had forecast profit of no more
than 300 million pounds.  Dunelm Group Plc (DNLM)  jumped 3.8 percent to 680 pence after the
budget  home-furnishings retailer  said same-store sales rose 3
percent in the first quarter, beating the average analyst
estimate of a 2.7 percent increase.  Tesco slid 2.6 percent to 327.95 pence after the  U.K.’s
largest retailer  said trading profit, a measure that excludes
gains from property, declined 11 percent to 1.59 billion pounds
over the six months ended Aug. 25.  FirstGroup plunged 21 percent to 193.4 pence, its biggest-
ever drop. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said in a
statement that “serious technical flaws” were found in the
franchise process. Virgin Trains may now retain the contract to
operate services between London and Glasgow.  Stagecoach Group
Plc (SGC) , which owns a stake 49 percent stake in the rail unit of
Virgin Group, climbed 1.9 percent to 288.8 pence.  Lamprell Plc (LAM)  sank 36 percent to 70 pence, its lowest price
since April 2009, after saying its full-year loss will be wider
than it had predicted. In August, the oil-rig engineer forecast
a $17 million loss for 2012. Lamprell has plummeted 73 percent
so far this year.  The FTSE 100 has failed to post back-to-back gains or
losses for the last eight days, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
