TNK-BP, the Russian oil venture half
owned by  BP Plc (BP/) , wants to sell its stake in the Junin 6 block in
Venezuela’s Orinoco crude belt to state-run OAO Rosneft,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  TNK-BP is considering its options for its share of
Consorcio Ruso, a group of  Russia ’s five biggest oil producers
that is helping develop the block, the people said, asking not
to be identified while plans are at a preliminary stage.  The move by Russia’s third-biggest oil producer may follow
OAO Surgutneftegas, which plans to exit the Junin 6 project,
three people said, declining to comment on prices. Surgut’s
talks are more advanced than TNK-BP’s plans, one person said.  TNK-BP is seeking about $200 million for its 20 percent of
Consorcio Ruso group,  Kommersant  reported earlier today, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Dmitry Sergeev, a spokesman for TNK-BP, declined to
comment, as did Alexey Artemnenko, a spokesman for Surgut.  The Russian companies and Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA began
production at the Junin 6 block at a Sept. 28 ceremony attended
by Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin. PDVSA, as the
Venezuelan state company is known, holds 60 percent of the
Petromiranda venture, which is developing Junin 6, and the
remaining 40 percent of the project is held in equal stakes by
the companies in Consorcio Ruso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
