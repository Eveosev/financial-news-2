Asian  stocks  fell as Chinese services
industries expanded at the weakest pace since at least March
2011 and Spain’s prime minister said that a bailout request
isn’t imminent.  Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. (1929) , a Hong Kong-based chain
with more revenue than Tiffany & Co., dropped 3.1 percent,
pacing declines among Chinese retailers.  Canon (7751)  Inc., the world’s
No. 1 camera maker that gets 31 percent of sales from Europe,
declined 1.9 percent. PT Bumi Resources slid 4.2 percent after
 Indonesia ’s biggest thermal coal exporter said it may sell a
unit and issue shares to raise cash and repay debt.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slipped 0.3 percent 121.68 as
of 6:04 p.m. in Tokyo, with almost three shares falling for
every two that rose on the gauge. The regional index is heading
for a third week of declines on concern political discord will
prevent  Europe  from resolving its debt crisis. Spain’s Prime
Minister Mariano Rajoy said yesterday a bailout request is not
imminent, disappointing investors.  “There are a lot of issues in Europe because it’s not easy
to execute austerity programs,” said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based
head of multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management (Asia)
Ltd., which oversees about $8 billion. “Spain needs financial
aid, but there are always political and social considerations.
Austerity is tough. China will introduce additional stimulus
measures in their own time.”  Australian Rate Cut  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slid 0.5 percent and
 Taiwan ’s Taiex Index fell 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng
Index (HSI)  gained 0.2 percent as it resumed trading following a long
weekend. Markets in  China  and South Korea are closed today for
holidays.  Australia ’s S&P ASX 200 Index gained 0.1 percent, closing
at the highest level since August 2011, as traders raised bets
that Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens will
follow yesterday’s rate cut with another reduction on Nov. 6.  Traders are pricing in a 75 percent chance of a quarter-
point reduction next month, according to swaps data compiled by
Bloomberg. That would match the 50-year low of 3 percent at the
height of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.  Chinese retailers dropped after mainland non-manufacturing
industries expanded at the weakest pace since at least March
2011 as officials struggle to reverse a slowdown in the world’s
second-biggest economy.  Chinese Retailers  Chow Tai Fook declined 3.1 percent to HK$10.70 in Hong
Kong. China Dongxiang Group Co., a sportswear retailer, sank 6
percent to 78 Hong Kong cents.  Anta Sports Products Ltd. (2020)  slipped
2.9 percent to HK$5.79.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The gauge added 0.1 percent yesterday in New York as a
rebound in Apple Inc. overshadowed disappointment after Rajoy
said a bailout request from Spain isn’t imminent.  Companies that do business in Europe dropped. Canon slid
1.9 percent to 2,555 yen in Tokyo. Cosco Pacific Ltd., which
operates a port in  Greece , slipped 1.3 percent to HK$10.70.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 6.9 percent this year as
policy makers boosted stimulus measures to counter a global
economic slowdown. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at
12.8 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.8
times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The Asian Development Bank cut the region’s inflation and
growth forecasts amid Europe’s debt crisis and economic slodown
in the U.S. and China. Asia excluding  Japan  will expand 6.1
percent this year, the slowest pace since 2009, the Manila-based
lender reported today.  Bumi Resources  Bumi Resources declined 4.2 percent to 680 rupiah. The
company is considering the sale of PT Fajar Bumi Sakti,
Corporate Secretary Dileep Srivastava said yesterday at a
Jakarta briefing where President Director Ari Hudaya said it may
also sell stock. An investigation initiated by shareholder Bumi
Plc, founded by Nathaniel Rothschild, prompted concern it may
struggle to repay debts.  Palm-oil producers slumped after the price of the commodity
plunged by the most since October 2008 yesterday. Sime Darby
Bhd., the world’s biggest supplier, fell 3.4 percent to 9.41
ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. First Resources Ltd. dropped 5.4
percent to S$1.94 in  Singapore .  Daiichi Sankyo Co. sank 5.4 percent to 1,191 yen in  Tokyo .
A panel of scientific advisers recommended an early end to the
trial of a lung-cancer medicine the Japanese pharmaceutical
company is developing with ArQule Inc., a Massachusetts-based
maker of experimental drugs.  APN News & Media Ltd. fell 3.5 percent 41.5 Australian
cents after the publisher of the New Zealand Herald said it has
nothing to announce about its asset revenue following a record
surge yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
