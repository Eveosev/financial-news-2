A global nickel surplus may expand
for a third year to the highest level since 2008 as supply from
new mining projects outweighs China’s demand growth,  Japan ’s top
producer said.  Supply will likely exceed demand by 60,000 metric tons in
2013, said Toru Higo,  Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. (5713) ’s general
manager of nickel sales and raw materials. Supply outstripped
demand by 40,000 tons this year and 22,000 tons in 2011, he said.  Sherritt International Corp. (S)  said Sept. 13 that its
Ambatovy project in Madagascar got a six-month approval to
operate commercially.  Xstrata Plc (XTA) ’s Koniambo project in New
Caledonia is scheduled to start production during the first
quarter of next year, spokesman Wayne Groeneveld said Sept. 26.
China, the biggest consumer, has been ramping up infrastructure
spending to counter a slowdown in economic growth that’s on
course for the weakest annual pace in more than two decades.  “The surplus will likely increase further next year with
the Ambatovy and Koniambo projects starting production,” Higo
said in an interview yesterday. “On the demand side, all
countries except  China  are slowing.”  Prices of the metal, used for corrosion resistance in
stainless steel, have fallen 0.4 percent this year, making it
the worst performer among six base metals on the London Metal
Exchange. Three-month delivery metal traded at $18,636 a ton on
the LME at 2:40 p.m. in  Tokyo . LME stockpiles on Oct. 1 reached
the highest level since March 30, 2011.  China Infrastructure  World stainless-steel output may gain 4.7 percent to 35.7
million tons in 2013, Higo said. Output by China, the biggest
producer, is expected to rise 9.7 percent to 15.8 million tons
with the new infrastructure projects, he said.  In September, China’s government approved  plans  for 2,018
kilometers (1,254 miles) of roads, as well as sewage plants,
port and warehouse projects and subways.  China’s nickel output including pig iron may fall 3.4
percent to 425,000 tons in 2013, while demand will likely rise
6.9 percent to 770,000 tons, he said. The country’s nickel pig
iron output may drop 7.7 percent to 240,000 tons because of
lower nickel prices, he said. Pig iron is a substitute made from
low-grade ore from  Indonesia  and the  Philippines .  China’s nickel imports will reach a record 345,000 tons in
2013, up 23 percent from this year, Higo said. Japan’s exports
will jump 2 percent to an all-time high of 89,000 tons as
producers ship more ferronickel and nickel oxide to China,
 Taiwan , South Korea and Southeast Asia to make up for sluggish
demand at home, Higo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
