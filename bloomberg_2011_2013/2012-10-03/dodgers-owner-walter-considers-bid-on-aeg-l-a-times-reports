Los Angeles Dodgers Chairman  Mark Walter  is considering a bid on Anschutz Entertainment Group
Inc., the Los Angeles Times reported.  Walter, the chief executive officer of Guggenheim Partners
LLC, said the possible “synergy” in marketing and sponsorship
among the Los Angeles teams attracts him to AEG as an
investment, the newspaper said.  AEG owns the National Hockey League’s Kings, the Galaxy of
Major League Soccer and a 30 percent stake in the  National
Basketball Association ’s Lakers. Anschutz has also offered to
fund construction of a $1 billion, 65,000-seat stadium in
downtown Los Angeles to try to lure one of the  National Football
League ’s 32 teams.  Walter said Guggenheim will make a final evaluation on the
prospect of bidding on AEG after the company releases
confidential financial information.  Guggenheim bought the Dodgers for $2.15 billion in May. AEG
officials have said the company that owns the Staples Center and
the Home Depot Center may bring as much as $7 billion, the Times
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
