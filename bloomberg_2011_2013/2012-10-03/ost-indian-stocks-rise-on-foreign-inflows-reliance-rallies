Indian (SENSEX)  stocks climbed to the highest
level in 14 months as foreign funds increased their holdings of
domestic equities amid optimism the government will undertake
measures to revive economic growth.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 0.2 percent
to 18,869.69, the highest close since July 25, 2011.  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest refining complex,
gained the most in a week.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the biggest
home-products maker, added 2.3 percent.  Indian equities had their biggest monthly advance since
January last month as foreign funds bought shares worth $4.1
billion amid a burst of policy announcements aimed at reviving
an economy expanding at near its slowest pace in three years.
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  in September cut fuel subsidies,
opened retailing and airlines to foreigners and reduced a tax on
local companies’ overseas borrowings.  “Flurry of announcements and the coordinated, thoughtful
approach has surprised everybody and the markets,” Madhav Dhar,
managing partner of GTI Capital Group, told Bloomberg TV India
in an interview. “The nose of the plane is lifted up but we
need to keep the engines going. We have to fire at all cylinders
and I think we’re seeing signs of that.”  The Sensex has surged 22 percent this year as foreigners
purchased a net $16.2 billion of equities, the most among 10
Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, which excludes  China . The
flows pushed up the rupee 5.3 percent in the three months ended
September, the strongest quarterly gain since 2009 and the best
performance among Asian currencies. The rupee rose 0.4 percent
from Oct. 1 to 52.1650.  ‘Great Trade’  Yen-based investors who buy rupee-denominated assets will
earn 15 percent, including interest, in a year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. This would be the best gains among
most-traded Asian currencies.  “Exchanging dollars into the mid-50s and buying Indian
assets at depressed levels, and particularly in countries like
Japan, exchanging yen to buy Indian assets in one of the great
trades in history,” GTI Capital’s Dhar said. “On a longer term
basis, the rupee is extremely undervalued. The fair value is
closer to 40 than 52 or 53. Fair value is a long term, nebulous
concept but it is an anchor on a longer term cycle.”  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index increased 0.2 percent to 5,731.25.
Its October futures settled at 5,768.25. The BSE-200 Index rose
0.3 percent to 2,325.53. The National Stock Exchange of India
and the BSE Ltd. traded 889 million shares on Oct. 1, equivalent
to the 12-month daily average.  Reliance Industries gained 1.5 percent to 846.1 rupees.
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software services
exporter, increased 1.5 percent to 1,322.65 rupees. Hindustan
Unilever rose 2.3 percent to 555.5 rupees.  Hindalco Industries
Ltd. (HNDL)  added 1.5 percent to 124.7 rupees.  Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  rose 2.1
percent to 365.2 rupees.  ‘Attractive Valuations’  The Sensex trades at 15 times estimated  earnings , the most
expensive since March 30. The ratio is still below the gauge’s
three-year average of 16.3, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
measure’s 14-day relative strength index is at 73. Some
investors see readings above 70 as a signal to sell.  “I would still say valuations are attractive but we have
had a very sharp move and you might see some consolidation,”
said Dhar. “As they say bull markets are born in despair, grow
with cynicisms, mature with optimism and die with euphoria. We
are somewhere between despair and cynicism. I’m not concerned
valuations are stretched or an impediment to further moves.”  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , the second-largest software services maker,
declined 1.2 percent to 2,578.25 rupees.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , India’s
biggest cigarette company, fell 1.1 percent to 270.25 rupees.
 Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , the second-largest motorcycle maker, dropped
1.6 percent to 1,781.25 rupees.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd., India’s biggest steelmaker by
value, plunged 4.9 percent to 415.4 rupees on a coal ministry
proposal to bar utilities from selling electricity at market
rates using coal from mines given to them for free.  To contact the reporter on this story:
