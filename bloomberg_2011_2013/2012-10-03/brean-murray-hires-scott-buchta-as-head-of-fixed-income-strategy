Brean Murray Carret & Co. LLC, the
New York-based investment bank and asset manager, has hired
 Scott Buchta  as its head of fixed-income strategy as the company
expands in bonds.  Buchta, 48, started this week, he confirmed today in a
telephone interview. He was among about 20 workers fired in
August by Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP as that firm retrenches
amid a slump in trading and mergers and acquisitions.  Brean Murray this year hired former Gleacher & Co.
executives Robert Fine and Robert Tirschwell to build its fixed-
income business. The May exit from Gleacher of Fine, who oversaw
mortgage bonds, asset-backed securities and  interest rates , and
Tirschwell, his head of trading, led to the departure of as many
as half of the unit’s 70 employees.  Buchta previously headed investment strategy at Braver
Stern Securities LLC and Guggenheim Securities, after 20 years
at Bear Stearns Cos., which he left in 2008 after its purchase
by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
