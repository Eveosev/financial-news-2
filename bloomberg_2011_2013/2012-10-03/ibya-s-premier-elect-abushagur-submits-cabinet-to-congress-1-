Abushagur asked the National Congress to approve a new Cabinet
charged with rebuilding a nation ravaged in last year’s bloody
uprising.  The list, which was released to reporters in Tripoli,
includes nominees for 29 of the 30 posts, with only the foreign
minister yet to be named. Abushagur proposed Al-Mabrouk Eissa
Abu Haroura to head the pivotal Oil Ministry. The person
nominated for defense minister is Abdusalam Jadallah al-Salheen
Saleh Obedie, a field commander from Benghazi who took part in
the uprising against  Muammar Qaddafi , Guma Mishri, a high-
ranking police officer, said in an interview. The interior
ministry nominee is Omar al-Aswad, who had previously worked on
foreign security, he said.  The National Congress will vote on the nominees tomorrow,
Omar Hameidan, spokesman for the legislature, told reporters.  Abushagur named three deputy premiers, representing the
country’s eastern, western and southern regions, according to
the list, released by the congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
