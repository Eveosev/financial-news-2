Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) , the loan-
servicing firm whose stock has more than doubled this year,
gained the most since 2009 after agreeing to buy WL Ross & Co.’s
Homeward Residential Holdings Inc. for $750 million in cash and
convertible preferred stock.  Ocwen  jumped  20 percent to close at $34.88 in New York, the
top performer on the 1,989-company  Russell 2000 Index. (RTY)  Homeward
services about 422,000 mortgages with an unpaid principal
balance exceeding $77 billion, West Palm Beach, Florida-based
Ocwen said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer William Erbey, Ocwen’s biggest
shareholder, has led the company’s expansion since the 2008
financial crisis as other firms exit the mortgage-servicing
business. Erbey oversaw the purchases of servicing units from
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  last year.  “Homeward brings with it a global servicing platform as
well as a growing origination business that is already operating
at a $10 billion annual run-rate,” Erbey, 63, said in the
statement.  Ocwen has advanced 141 percent this year. Erbey  owned  13
percent of the shares as of Aug. 21, according data compiled by
Bloomberg.  WL Ross, led by billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, organized
Homeward in 2007 and has since added assets from  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
and Option One Mortgage Corp., a division of  H&R Block Inc. (HRB) 
Ocwen will pay $588 million in cash and $162 million in Ocwen
convertible preferred stock. The deal will add to earnings
immediately, according to the statement.  ‘Good Holding’  “It’s been a good holding for us,” Ross, 74, said in a
phone interview. “We also recognize that mortgage-servicing is
a scale business. Therefore we would need to be either the
acquisitor and roll up more or be an acquiree.”  Ross said that he explored an initial public offering for
Homeward before deciding to sell it to Ocwen. Homeward had an
internal rate of return of 14 percent a year, he said.  Mortgage servicing is “a good business to be in,” Ross
said. “I don’t think it’s topped out. We wouldn’t have kept
convertible stock if we did.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
