Irish Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  said
 Europe  will move forward with the measures needed for Ireland to
meet the conditions of its aid package and get its economy back
on track.  “I am confident that colleagues remain committed to
securing a positive outcome,” he said in prepared remarks for a
speech in Brussels.  Ireland, which will take on the European Union’s six-month
presidency in January, is trying to lower the cost of its bank
bailout, in part by seeking to restructure 30 billion euros ($39
billion) of promissory notes used to rescue the former  Anglo
Irish Bank . The country also supports related efforts to create
a euro-area bank supervisor and allow direct bank aid from the
17-nation currency bloc’s firewall fund.  Kenny said the EU may need more integration of its budgets
and economies in order to stabilize the common currency and the
17-nation economy.  “Let us move swiftly to do what needs to be done,” Kenny
said. “But in examining how to move ahead, let us not distract
ourselves chasing rainbows.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
