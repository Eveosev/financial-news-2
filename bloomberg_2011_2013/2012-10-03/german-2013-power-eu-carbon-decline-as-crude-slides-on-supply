German power for 2013 fell to near a
record as European Union carbon permits and Brent oil dropped
after U.S. crude output climbed to the highest level in more
than 15 years and fuel consumption decreased.  Baseload next-year electricity, for supplies around the
clock, lost as much as 0.7 percent as carbon dropped as much as
4.1 percent in its longest streak of declines since Sept. 17.
Brent tumbled 2.6 percent after the Energy Department said crude
output rose to the most since December 1996.  Power for 2013 fell as much as 35 cents to 47.40 euros
($61.20) a megawatt-hour, near the record-low 47.30 euros on
Sept. 25, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contract was at 47.50 euros at 5:50 p.m. Berlin time. Carbon for
December delivery slid 24 cents to 7.63 euros a metric ton on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  Brent for November lost $2.88 to $108.69 a barrel. Crude
affects natural-gas generation costs in Europe and traders
consider prices of the fuel when buying and selling long-term
power contracts.  The German 2013  clean-spark spread , a calculation of the
profit utilities get from selling electricity for next year
after accounting for the cost of gas and emissions permits,
narrowed 2.4 percent to minus 9.87 euros a megawatt-hour at 5:40
p.m., data compiled by Bloomberg show. The calculation has been
negative since the beginning of this year.  Power for next month fell 1.1 percent to 48.65 euros a
megawatt-hour, broker data show. The day-ahead contract gained
60 percent to 44.75 euros a megawatt-hour as demand was forecast
to increase after a holiday in  Germany  today. The contract
settled at 44.77 euros in the daily auction on European Energy
Exchange AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
