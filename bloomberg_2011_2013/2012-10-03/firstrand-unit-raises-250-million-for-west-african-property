  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ,  South Africa ’s
second-biggest financial-services company, said the property
unit of its investment banking arm raised $250 million to
develop real estate in West Africa.  The money will be used to supply the “strong demand for
high-grade retail and commercial property,” Johannesburg-based
RMB Westport said in an e-mailed statement today. Nigeria, Ghana
and Angola have been “earmarked as key jurisdictions in which
to develop retail and commercial property.”  An increasing proportion of Africa’s population is moving
into urban areas as economic growth quickens, with houses and
malls being built in major cities including Accra, Abuja and
Luanda, the capitals of Ghana, Nigeria and Angola respectively.  “Over the past decade, African economic output has more
than tripled, which is one of the many reasons we think that
 Africa  today holds the greatest overall investment potential for
all frontier markets globally,” Michael O’Malley, a director of
RMB Westport, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
