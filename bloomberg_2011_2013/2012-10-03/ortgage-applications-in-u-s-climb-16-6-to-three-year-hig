Mortgage applications in the U.S.
climbed last week to the highest level in more than three years
as borrowing costs dropped to a record low.  The  Mortgage Bankers Association â€™s  index  jumped 16.6
percent in the period ended Sept. 28 from the prior week to
reach the highest point since April 2009, the Washington-based
group said today. Purchase applications rose 3.9 percent and
refinancing surged 19.6 percent.  The average rate on a 30-year fixed loan fell to 3.53
percent, an all-time low in the series dating back to 1990, from
3.63 percent the prior week. Borrowing costs on a 15-year fixed
mortgage decreased to 2.90 percent from 2.98 percent.  The share of applicants seeking to refinance a loan rose to
83.3 percent, the most since January 2009, from 81.2 percent the
previous week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
