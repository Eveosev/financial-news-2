Production in the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico 
will exceed 2009’s peak and top 2 million barrels a day of oil
equivalent in 2019.  Gulf output will increase in 2013 after declining this
year, Lauren Payne, an analyst for Wood Mackenzie Ltd., said at
a meeting in Houston. She said drilling days increased
significantly this year from 2011 after declining for two years
in the wake of the 2010  BP Plc (BP/)  oil spill.  Gulf oil production  fell to 1.32 million barrels a day in
2011 from a peak of 1.56 million in 2009, U.S. Energy Department
data show. Through July of this year, production was 1.27
million barrels a day. Wood Mackenzie’s forecast includes both
oil and gas.  Most of the production growth in the coming years will be
heavy sour crude, Payne said. Heavy refers to density, sour to
high sulfur content.  Companies will spend about $70 billion on Gulf production
through 2030, more than in all other major deep-water areas
combined, Julie Wilson, a senior analyst for exploration at  Wood
Mackenzie , said at the meeting. The Gulf is attractive to
producers because of favorable access to markets and acreage and
well-developed infrastructure, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
