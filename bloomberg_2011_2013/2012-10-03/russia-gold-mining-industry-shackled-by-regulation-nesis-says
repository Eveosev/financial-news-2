Russia ’s gold-mining industry is
“shackled” by poor regulation, limiting its development,
according to  Polymetal International Plc (POLY)  Chief Executive Officer
Vitaly Nesis.  “Russia has the best prospects globally for gold mining,”
Nesis said today at the  Minex Russia Forum  in Moscow. While it’s
politically stable and has “good” resources, state rules
hamper efforts to expand production, he said.  Russia, boasting the third-biggest  gold reserves , ranks
only fourth in terms of output,  U.S. Geological Survey  data
show. That means producers can’t take full advantage of prices
that have risen for 11 straight years. Licensing of gold
deposits is held up by time-consuming bureaucracy, according to
St. Petersburg-based Polymetal, which left the MSCI Russia Index
last year in favor of the U.K. FTSE 100’s wider investor base.  The licensing process is “very slow” and not technically
advanced, with some state bodies not even accepting electronic
documents, Nesis said. He advised separating legislation for oil
and gas from laws governing hard commodities such as gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
