The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars held near the highest level in more than three weeks,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was little
changed at 27 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate
at 8:20 a.m. in  London , the most expensive since Sept. 5,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The cost has increased
from minus 17 on Sept. 14, the cheapest since June 2011.  The one-year basis swap was unchanged at 27 basis points,
or 0.27 percentage point, below Euribor.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held near the lowest since August 2007. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as
the Euribor-OIS spread, was little changed at 13.5 basis points.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at a
record low 0.087 percent yesterday from 0.095 the day before.
The Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs
over the next three months, was unchanged at 8.4 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday, placing 297 billion euros ($383 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based central bank from 295 billion euros the
day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
