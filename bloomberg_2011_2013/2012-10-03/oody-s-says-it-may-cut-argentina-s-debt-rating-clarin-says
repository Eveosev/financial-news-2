Moody’s Investors Service may cut
Argentina’s debt rating because of the government’s
unpredictable policies, newspaper  Clarin  reported, citing
Moody’s analyst  Gabriel Torres .  Argentina’s B3 rating, six levels below investment grade,
may be cut further to a level similar to Cuba’s, the Buenos
Aires-based newspaper said, citing Torres.  The company has a negative outlook on Argentina because of
its accelerating  inflation,  foreign exchange restrictions, the
government’s use of pension funds and central bank reserves, a
lack of clarity in its statistics and its defaulted debt with
the Paris Club, Clarin cited Torres as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
