Cattle prices fell for the first time
in three sessions on signs of slowing U.S. demand for beef. Hog
futures declined from a seven-week high.  Meatpackers processed 372,000 cattle in the first three
days of this week, down 1.1 percent from the same period a week
earlier, and down 5.8 percent from year earlier, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. Wholesale- beef  prices have dropped 2.1
percent this year, government data show.  “Domestic demand has been lackluster,” Dick Quiter, an
account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC in  Chicago , said
in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to
settle $1.26025 a pound in Chicago. The commodity has still
risen 3.8 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement increased 0.2
percent to $1.468 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for December settlement dropped 1.3 percent to
settle at 75.875 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, after reaching 77.75 cents, the highest
since Aug. 14. Prices have slumped 10 percent this year.  The hog market “just got a little overdone, and maybe
moved up a little too fast,” Quiter said. “People just decided
to take a little profit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
