The New York Metropolitan
Transportation Authority’s overtime costs exceeded budget
forecasts by a combined $100 million in the past two years
because of reduced staffing, storm-related emergencies and
maintenance needs, state Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said.  The comptroller, in a report on the agency’s finances, also
found that its debt service may reach $3 billion by 2016, 41
percent higher than this year. Debt-service costs as a
percentage of total revenue may rise to almost 20 percent by
2018 from 15.9 percent in 2011, even with biennial 7 percent
fare and toll increases, the comptroller reported.  Even so, the MTA’s finances have stabilized because of
increased ridership, lower energy and interest costs, and
changes expected to save about $1.1 billion a year by 2016, the
report said. One risk stems from a court decision under appeal
that struck down a  payroll tax  in counties served by MTA
commuter trains, which officials expected to generate $1.5
billion in 2012 and almost $1.8 billion by 2016, DiNapoli said.  “There are areas of concern,” DiNapoli said in a
statement. “The pace of the economic recovery, litigation
challenging the constitutionality of the Payroll Mobility Tax,
collective bargaining and funding for the next capital program
could all affect the budget. Fare and toll hikes continue to
outpace inflation, placing a burden on working men and women
across the metropolitan region.”  Fare Increases  The biggest U.S. transit agency, which has a budget of
$12.6 billion, carries an average of 8.7 million weekday riders
on subways, buses and regional commuter lines. It also operates
several bridges and tunnels.  The MTA financial plan projects deficits of $487 million in
2013, $759 million in 2014, $1.1 billion in 2015 and $1.4
billion in 2016. Fare and toll increases account for 82 percent
of the resources available to close those gaps over the next
four years, with agency savings accounting for 18 percent, the
comptroller’s report said.  “We know the debt service amounts to a significant amount
of money and we’ve budgeted for it,” Adam Lisberg, an MTA
spokesman, said in an interview. “If we didn’t spend the money
installing subway platform countdown clocks, replacing and
modernizing signal switches and repairing rails, the system
would go back to its bad old days. So we have to do the work,
and increasingly such costs come from borrowing.”  Agency officials reduced overtime costs in 2010 by $49
million from a 2009 peak of $664 million, only to see it
increase $75 million more than they expected last year, to $655
million.  Officials attributed the increase to reduced personnel and
more demand for workers after winter snowstorms and Tropical
Storm Irene hit the region, the comptroller said. This year,
agency officials expect overtime to reach $578 million, or about
$25 million higher than they previously budgeted, the
comptroller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
