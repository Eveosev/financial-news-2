Oil fell to a two-month low in New
York after the government reported that U.S. crude production
climbed to the highest level in more than 15 years and fuel
consumption decreased.  Futures dropped 4.1 percent after the Energy Department
said  crude output  rose 11,000 barrels a day to 6.52 million last
week, the most since December 1996. Total fuel demand fell 0.3
percent to  18.3 million barrels  a day in the four weeks ended
Sept. 28, the lowest level since April. Crude and distillate
stockpiles declined as gasoline supplies rose.  “The oil market is following the fundamentals today,”
said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc. in
Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “We’re in a very comfortable situation
as far as supply and demand are concerned.”  Crude oil for November delivery declined $3.75 to $88.14 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the lowest
settlement since Aug. 2. Prices are down 11 percent this year.  Brent oil for November settlement decreased $3.40, or 3
percent, to end the session at $108.17 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange, the lowest close since Aug.
2. The European benchmark crude was at a premium of $20.03 to
the New York-traded West  Texas  Intermediate grade, up from
$19.68 yesterday.  The U.S. met 83 percent of its energy needs in the first
six months of the year, department data show. If the trend
continues through 2012, it will be the highest level since 1991.  New Technology  A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale
formations in states including  North Dakota , Texas and  Oklahoma .
North Dakota’s output rose 26 percent this year through July,
according to the department.  This technology unleashed a boom in natural gas output that
propelled supplies to a record last year and sent prices to a
decade low of $1.907 per million British thermal units in April.  “The demand picture is looking poor and the market’s in
the midst of a down trend,” said Todd Horwitz, chief strategist
at Adam Mesh Trading Group in  Chicago . “We’re going lower.”  Crude oil supplies were up 8.4 percent last week from a
year earlier, the Energy Department said today. Stockpiles
dropped 482,000 barrels from the previous week to 364.7 million
barrels. Inventories were forecast to increase 1.5 million
barrels, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  Imports of crude increased 511,000 barrels a day to 8.11
million in the week ended Sept. 28. Shipments have arrived at an
average rate of 8.84 million barrels a day this year.  No Shortage  “There’s certainly no shortage of crude oil in the U.S.,”
said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in
New York. “Crude imports at 8.1 million barrels a day are at a
low level by historical standards. The rise in domestic output
kept supplies from posting a big decline.”  Crude oil stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery
point for WTI, rose 135,000 barrels to 43.9 million last week,
the first gain in four weeks.  Gasoline inventories  rose 114,000 barrels to 195.9 million
last week, the department said. Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, tumbled 3.67
million barrels to 124.1 million.  Demand for gasoline dropped 1.5 percent to 8.68 million
barrels a day on average in the four weeks ended Sept. 28, the
report showed.  “The inventory numbers were rather neutral but demand
looks pretty awful,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “A
weak economy and falling demand will probably leave us with
fuller oil tanks in the months to come.”  Gasoline Prices  Gasoline for November delivery dropped 6.97 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.7995 a gallon in New York, the lowest settlement
since July 25. November heating oil slipped 5.91 cents, or 1.9
percent, to end the session at $3.0664 a gallon.  Futures declined before the report as a measure of  China’s
economy  fell, signaling fuel demand may decrease in the world’s
second-biggest user of the commodity, after the U.S.  Chinese services industries expanded at the weakest pace
since at least March 2011, while euro-area services and
manufacturing output contracted.  “Energy markets appear to be moving on concerns about
weakening demand,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
the Price Futures Group in Chicago. “The Chinese non-
manufacturing data seems to signal that we’ll be seeing less
fuel use.”  China ’s services purchasing managers’ index fell to 53.7 in
September from 56.3 in August, the National Bureau of Statistics
and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in Beijing
today. The number was lower than any previous reading in data
compiled by Bloomberg starting in March 2011.  ‘The Malaise’  “The malaise in  Asia  and Europe, especially in China, is
finally being reflected in this market,” Schork said.  The dollar climbed as much as 0.3 percent to $1.2878 per
euro, reducing the appeal of commodities to investors. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell 2.3 percent.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 596,616
contracts as of 4:38 p.m. Volume totaled 366,655 contracts
yesterday, 30 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.56 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
