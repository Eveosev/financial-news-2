Finland should promote foreign direct
investments to stabilize  economic growth  and create jobs as it
seeks to catch up to its European peers, a committee reporting
to the  Economy Ministry  said.  Finland needs foreign direct investment worth as much as 30
billion euros ($39 billion) over the next eight years to achieve
that target, the Helsinki-based ministry said today on its
 website .  Finlandâ€™s stock of foreign investments totaled about 60
billion euros last year, equal to about 32 percent of gross
domestic product. Investment stock should grow between 20
billion to 30 billion euros by 2020 to exceed the European Union
average of 42 percent, the ministry said.  The government will map out a strategy to attract
investments by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
