Gold futures advanced for the second
time in three days on speculation that moves by the world’s
central banks to bolster economic growth will spur demand for
the metal as a hedge against inflation.  Bullion advanced 5.1 percent last month as the  Federal
Reserve  announced a third round of stimulus as the jobless rate
held above 8 percent for a 43rd month in August. The  European
Central Bank  also pledged to buy more debt in September, and the
 Bank of Japan (8301)  added to an asset-purchase fund. The U.S. Labor
Department will release the latest employment figures on Oct. 5.  “The quantitative easing announcements continue to support
the market,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup
Inc.’s institutional client group in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “The market will be closely watching the
payroll numbers as that will tell us how the economy is doing.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,779.80 an ounce at 1:56 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Futures reached $1,794.40 on Oct. 1, the highest since
Nov. 14.  The U.S. jobless rate probably rose to 8.2 percent last
month from 8.1 percent in August, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before the
government report.  Silver futures for December delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$34.69 an ounce in New York.  Platinum futures for January delivery climbed 0.4 percent
to $1,694.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
seventh-straight increase.  Palladium futures for December delivery advanced 0.6
percent to $657.90 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
