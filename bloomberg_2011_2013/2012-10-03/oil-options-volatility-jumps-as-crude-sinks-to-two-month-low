Crude oil options volatility jumped
to a 10-day high as the underlying futures sank to the lowest
level in two months in the biggest retreat since June.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 31.9 percent as of 2:40 p.m. in  New York , up
from 28.7 percent yesterday.  “The lower we go, the firmer volatility becomes,” said
Ray Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Crude oil for November delivery fell $3.75, or 4.1 percent,
to settle at $88.14 a barrel at 2:06 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the lowest level since Aug. 2 and biggest
decline since June 21.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $100 calls, bets that prices would rise, which fell 51
cents to 64 cents a barrel at 2:48 p.m. with 2,464 lots trading.
November $80 puts were the second-most active, with 2,213 lots
exchanged as they rose 21 cents to 27 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall accounted for 51 percent of the
55,927 contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets made up 62 percent of
the 160,135 contracts traded.  November $105 calls were the most actively traded options
with 28,788 lots changing hands. They fell 5 cents to 7 cents a
barrel. November $100 calls declined 9 cents to 21 cents on
volume of 14,907.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
47,537 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 45,651 lots
and December $125 calls with 44,317.  To contact the reporter on this story:
