Canada must be open to foreign
investment to help expand its economy and should seek new
markets beyond the U.S. for its oil exports, TMX Group Ltd.
Chief Executive Officer  Thomas Kloet  said.  “I believe it is imperative that Canada remain open to
foreign direct investment to help fund our economic expansion,”
Kloet said at a panel discussion at the Toronto Global Forum
conference.  The government must set clear ground rules that encourage
and welcome investment while ensuring that the best interests of
Canadian businesses and citizens are defended, said Kloet, who
oversees the Toronto Stock Exchange owner.  Kloet’s comments come as the Canadian government reviews
Chinese state-owned  Cnooc Ltd.’s (883)  $15.1 billion takeover offer of
Calgary-based  Nexen Inc. (NXY)   Canada must build on its successes of trade pacts with
other countries, including the North American Free Trade
Agreement, to add agreements with new international markets, he
said.  Canada  must move beyond the U.S. to seek new markets for
exporting its oil, Kloet said.  “One of the biggest drivers of current and future
prosperity for Canada rests with trade with a single country,”
Kloet said. “Regardless of the success of this trading zone,
Canada must continue to seek new markets for this critical
export commodity.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
