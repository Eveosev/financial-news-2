Farmers in  Brazil ’s Mato Grosso state
took advantage of early season rainfall to plant about 2 percent
of their soybean acreage for 2012-13, according to Soybean &
Corn Advisor Inc.  Mato Grosso farmers are seen planting 7.89 million hectares
(19.5 million acres) of the oilseed, Hinsdale, Illinois-based
Soybean & Corn Advisor wrote in an online report today. Field
work is expected to progress slowly this week on a forecast for
dry weather, it said.  “Many farmers are still cautious about planting their
soybeans due to the drier near-term forecast,” the consulting
company led by Michael Cordonnier wrote. “The farmers who have
started planting their soybeans are generally those who want to
plant a second crop of corn or cotton after the soybeans.”  Brazil is expected to overtake the U.S. as the largest
soybean exporter in 2012-13, after the worst U.S. drought in 50
years damaged crops and hurt yields, according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture projections. Soybean prices have
advanced 25 percent in  Chicago  since the start of the year.  Farmers in Parana state were allowed to start planting
Sept. 21, and have seeded 3 percent of 2012-13 soybean acreage,
which is expected to increase 4 percent to 4.58 million
hectares.  About 30 percent of the main-season corn crop in Parana has
been planted, with acreage expected to fall 13 percent to
847,000 hectares.  “The average corn planting pace in Parana over the past
three years for this date is about 35 percent, so corn planting
has been a little slow due to drier weather earlier in
September,” Soybean & Corn adviser wrote.  In Rio Grande do Sul, farmers have planted 35 percent to 40
percent of their corn crop, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
