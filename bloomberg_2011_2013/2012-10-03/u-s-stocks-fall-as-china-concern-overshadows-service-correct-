(Corrects to two-day advance in second paragraph.)  U.S. stocks retreated as concern
about  China ’s economy overshadowed better-than-forecast growth
in American employment and service industries.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.2 percent to
1,442.85 at 10:05 a.m. in New York, snapping a two-day advance.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, rose to 55.1 in September from the prior month’s 53.7,
the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today.  Another report today showed companies added 162,000 workers
to payrolls in September following a revised 189,000 jump in
August, figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Employer
Services showed today. The median forecast of 38 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg projected a 140,000 advance. Estimates
ranged from 90,000 to 190,000 in the Bloomberg survey.  The data comes two days before the Labor Department’s
September payrolls report is published. The jobless rate in the
U.S. probably rose to 8.2 percent last month from 8.1 percent in
August, as employers kept a lid on hiring, economists said.
Payrolls increased by 115,000 in September, less than the
139,000 average over the first eight months of the year, the
report may also show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
