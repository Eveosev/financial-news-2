Iceland’s central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson lost a lawsuit he filed against the bank for
lowering his salary, the Reykjavik District Court ruled.  Gudmundsson was appointed governor of Sedlabanki in August
2009 on a 1.6 million kronur ($13,007) monthly salary. An
independent wage commission that determines the pay of
government executives reduced his salary to a total of 1.3
million kronur in March 2010, prompting Gudmundsson to sue the
bank demanding that the commission’s decision be invalidated.  The arguments of the plaintiff “don’t lead to a ruling in
his favor,” according to the  ruling  posted on the court’s
website. “Because of that the defendant is acquitted of all the
demands of the plaintiff.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
