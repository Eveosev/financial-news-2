Rasheed Wallace, a 38-year-old former
All-Star who holds the National Basketball Association records
for season and career technical fouls, signed with the  New York 
Knicks and ended his two-year retirement.  Wallace averaged 14.6 points and 6.7 rebounds during 15
years with the Washington Wizards, Portland Trail Blazers,
Atlanta Hawks,  Detroit  Pistons and Boston Celtics. He won an NBA
championship with the Pistons in 2004 alongside Knicks coach
Mike Woodson, who was an assistant in Detroit at the time.  The 6-foot-11 Wallace last played in the NBA for Boston
during the 2009-10 season, averaging nine points and 4.1
rebounds while starting 13 of 79 games. His 304 career technical
fouls are the most for a player in NBA history, according to
ESPN, and his single-season record of 41 came in 2000-01. He
made the All-Star Game most recently in the 2007-08 season.  Wallace probably will be used as a backup to power forward
Amar’e Stoudemire. The Knicks’ roster also includes 38-year-old
Marcus Camby and a pair of 39 year olds, Jason Kidd and Kurt Thomas.  The Knicks didn’t disclose terms of Wallace’s contract in a
news release.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
