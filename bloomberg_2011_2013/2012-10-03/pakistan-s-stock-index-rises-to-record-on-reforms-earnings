Pakistan’s  Karachi Stock Exchange 100
Index (KSE100) , Asia’s cheapest benchmark gauge, rose to a record after
banks and  oil companies  reported an increase in profits and the
government amended a tax on shares.  The index of 100 companies traded on the Karachi exchange
rose 0.4 percent to 15,712.21, surpassing the previous record
close of 15,676 set on April 18, 2008.  The benchmark index has surged 38.5 percent this year, the
third-best performance among 92 stock gauges tracked by
Bloomberg, after Pakistan eased rules on a capital gains tax on
shares in January to increase investor activity.  “The next six months will see more consolidation,” said
Muhammad Imran, head of local equity sales at Arif Habib Ltd. in
Karachi.  Overseas investors bought shares worth six billion rupees
($62 million) this year through Oct. 2, according to data on the
website of the National Clearing Company of  Pakistan , which
handles transactions for investors and traders at the exchange.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
