Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d.  will
be the first major Slovenian state-owned company to be sold to
international investors, Finance  reported , without saying where
it obtained the information.  The Maribor-based bank, the second biggest by assets after
Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., needs 100 million euros ($129
million) of fresh capital with  Russia â€™s  Gazprombank OJSC (GZPR)  among
the probable candidates to purchase a stake in the Slovenian
lender, the Ljubljana-based newspaper said.  Other companies that Slovenia will probably sell to
investors are the insurer Zavarovalnica Triglav d.d., Telekom
Slovenije Group d.d. and Petrol Group d.d., the energy company,
according to Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
