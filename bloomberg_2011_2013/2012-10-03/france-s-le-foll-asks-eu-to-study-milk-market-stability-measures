French Agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll asked European Union Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos to consider a milk-market stability mechanism as part of
the reform of the 27-nation bloc’s Common Agricultural Policy.  France  will end a system of taxing dairy farmers that
exceed production limits after the European Commission contested
the legality of the measure, the  Agriculture Ministry  wrote in a
e-mailed statement today.  “It’s imperative to develop alternative mechanisms to cope
with seasonal supply surpluses,” Le Foll was cited as saying in
the statement. “I’ve written to the commissioner to ask him to
think about, as part of the CAP reform, a community stability
mechanism in the milk sector.”  France is the EU’s second-largest milk producer, behind
 Germany , Eurostat data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
