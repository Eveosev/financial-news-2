Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , the
world’s largest microcontroller maker, will let about 17 percent
of its workforce leave through an early-retirement program as
the unprofitable company seeks to restructure.  Renesas got 7,511 buyout applications from workers and the
company will accept all of them, it said in a statement to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange today. The manufacturer will take a 85
billion-yen ($1.1 billion) charge in the fiscal second quarter
for the worker buyout program, it said.  The chipmaker, whose customers include  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and
Nintendo Co., said it expects to save 54 billion yen annually
from the reduction. The Kawasaki, Japan-based company said in
July it would eliminate 5,000 jobs and obtained 97 billion yen
in financial support from its major  shareholders  and banks last
month as it seeks to be profitable for the first time since it
was set up in 2010.  Renesas said it’s reviewing the impact on its earnings
forecasts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
