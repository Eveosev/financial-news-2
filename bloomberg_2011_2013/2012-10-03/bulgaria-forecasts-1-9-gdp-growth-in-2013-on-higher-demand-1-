Bulgaria ’s economy is forecast to
expand 1.9 percent in 2013 after an estimated 1.2 percent growth
in 2012, driven by increasing demand and investment linked to
European Union aid.  Next year’s budget-deficit assumption is 1 percent of gross
domestic product and 0.5 percent of GDP in 2014, after 1.3
percent of GDP this year, the  Finance Ministry  in the capital
Sofia said on its website today. The government forecasts
average EU-harmonized inflation at 3.4 percent next year, after
2.6 percent this year, according to the ministry.  Bulgaria, the EU’s poorest country in terms of economic
output per capita, weathered the global crisis without borrowing
from lenders abroad. Growth slowed to 0.5 percent from a year
earlier in the second quarter, the same as in the first three
months. The government works to cut the budget gap to help
contain the fallout from the euro debt crisis.  The  International Monetary Fund  raised this year’s economic
growth forecast for Bulgaria yesterday to 1 percent from a 0.8
percent estimate on April 17, and to 1.5 percent for 2013 citing
recovering exports. The economy grew 1.7 percent last year,
after a revised 0.4 percent in 2010. The European Commission
forecasts the economy to expand 0.5 percent this year and 1.9
percent in 2013.  Flat Tax  The government plans to keep personal and corporate income
taxes unchanged from a flat 10 percent next year, in an effort
to attract more investment and boost growth, the ministry said.  Bulgaria plans to sell  government bonds  worth as much as
1.2 billion lev ($792.3 million) a year through 2015, the
ministry said. Planned issue volumes will correspond to payments
due on the existing domestic and foreign debts, it said.  The government plans to raise pensions by 9.3 percent in
April next year and increase the highest pension to 770 lev
before elections in June. It also plans to increase spending on
education by 5 percent, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
