The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index
of 24  raw materials  slid 2.3 percent to 648.90, the lowest level
in two months. Crude oil and natural gas led the declines.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  declined 1.4
percent to 1,610.927, the least in a week.  CRUDE OIL  Oil sank to a two-month low in New York after the
government reported that U.S. crude output climbed to the
highest level in more than 15 years and fuel consumption
decreased.  Crude oil for November delivery declined $3.75, or 4.1
percent, to $88.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
It was the lowest settlement since Aug. 2.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures in New York dropped the most in seven
weeks on forecasts of moderating temperatures that may limit
demand from power plants.  Natural gas for November delivery fell 13.6 cents, or 3.9
percent, to $3.395 per million British thermal units on the
Nymex.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa slid to a five-week low after Ivory Coast, the
world’s top producer, set the annual price paid to farmers,
easing concern that exports will be disrupted by industry
changes. Sugar, coffee and orange juice dropped, while cotton
rose.  Cocoa for December delivery fell 2.4 percent to $2,416 a
metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery slid less than 0.1
percent to 21.58 cents a pound on ICE.  Also in New York, arabica-coffee futures for December
delivery retreated 1.4 percent to $1.8105 a pound.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery slipped less
than 0.1 percent to $1.16 a pound.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to
72.16 cents a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Soybean prices rebounded from a three-month low on
speculation that demand will increase in the U.S., the world’s
second-biggest consumer. Wheat rose, and corn declined.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.1 percent to
close at $15.3175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$8.73 a bushel on the CBOT.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$7.5675 a bushel.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline sank to the lowest level in 10 weeks as declines
in  Europe ’s services and manufacturing sectors highlighted the
toll the sovereign-debt crisis has wrought on the region’s
economy.  Gasoline for November delivery fell 6.97 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.7995 a gallon on the Nymex, the lowest settlement
since July 25.  November-delivery heating oil declined 5.91 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $3.0664 a gallon.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures rose for the second time in three days on
speculation that moves by the world’s central banks to bolster
economic growth will spur demand for the metal as a hedge
against inflation.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,779.80 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  Silver futures for December delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$34.69 an ounce on the Comex.  Nymex platinum futures for January delivery advanced 0.4
percent to $1,694.10 an ounce.  Palladium futures for December delivery gained 0.6 percent
to $657.90 an ounce on the Nymex.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for the first time in five sessions as Europe’s
lingering sovereign-debt crisis and signs of further slowing in
 China  fueled concerns the metal demand will fall.  Copper futures for December delivery declined 0.4 percent
to settle at $3.784 a pound on the Comex.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped 0.4 percent to $8,290 a metric ton ($3.76 a
pound).  Aluminum, zinc, and tin also fell in London, while nickel
and lead gained.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle prices fell for the first time in three sessions on
signs of slowing U.S. demand for beef. Hog futures declined from
a seven-week high.  Cattle futures for December delivery decreased 0.3 percent
to settle at $1.26025 a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement gained 0.2
percent to $1.468 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement declined 1.3 percent to
