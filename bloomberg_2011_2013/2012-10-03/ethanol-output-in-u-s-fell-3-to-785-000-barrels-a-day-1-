U.S. ethanol production fell 3
percent last week to 785,000 barrels a day, the least since the
Energy Department began publishing weekly data in 2010.  Output sank for the second week in a row. Inventories
plummeted 2.3 percent, the most in eight weeks, to 18.8 million
barrels, the department said.  The U.S. didnâ€™t  import  any ethanol for the first time since
June 15, the Energy Department said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 90 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool, down from 92 percent in the week ended
Sept. 21.  Denatured ethanol for October delivery jumped 1.8 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.39 a gallon at 11:06 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Prices have gained 8.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
