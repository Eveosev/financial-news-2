  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3) , the
iron-ore producer controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , fell to the lowest closing price since 2009 after Banco
Santander SA said the company has work to do before its Sudeste
port is operational.  MMX, based in Rio de Janeiro,  dropped  3.1 percent to 4.70
reais at the close in Sao Paulo, the lowest since April 2, 2009.
The stock  has fallen  30 percent this year.  MMX’s target of April for the first iron-ore shipment from
the Sudeste port “looks challenging,” Santander analysts
Felipe Reis and Alex Sciacio in Sao Paulo said in a note to
clients today after visiting the terminal located in Rio state.  “We had expected to see more advanced works at the Sudeste
port than we actually saw,” the analysts said. “Civil works
are still being completed at the port, and equipment assembly is
in the very preliminary stages.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
