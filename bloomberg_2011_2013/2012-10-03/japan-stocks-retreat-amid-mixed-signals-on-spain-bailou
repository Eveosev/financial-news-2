     Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell a fourth day,
with the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average capping the longest-losing
streak in a month, as the global slowdown weighs on earnings at
companies from Nippon Paper Group Inc. to retailer Uny Co.  Nippon Paper paced  declines  among makers of cardboard and
pulp products on a report it may miss a profit forecast. Uny
plunged 11 percent after the operator of department stores
predicted earnings that lagged analyst estimates. Daiichi Sankyo
Co. lost 5.4 percent dropped after halting development of a
lung-cancer treatment.  Japan  Petroleum Exploration Co. climbed
5.3 percent on a report it succeeded in trial extraction of
shale oil in the country.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.5 percent to 8,746.87 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo . Volume was about 11 percent below the 30-day
average with markets in  China  and  South Korea  shut for holidays.
The broader Topix Index dropped 0.5 percent to 727.39, with
about three stocks declining for each that rose.  “The domestic economy and earnings are not going well,
keeping a lid on the market,” said Shintaro Takeuchi, portfolio
investment group manager at Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire
Insurance Co. that manages 8.67 trillion yen ($111 billion) in
assets. “We are not seeing a big selloff, but Japanese stocks
are lagging behind.”  Relative Value  While the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has advanced 15
percent this year, Japan’s Topix has fallen 0.2 percent as
monetary easing in the U.S. and  Europe  drove up the yen and hurt
exporters’ earnings. Topix shares trade for about 0.9 times book
value on average, compared with 2.24 for the  S&P 500  and 1.5
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent today. The index
added 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday as a rebound in Apple
Inc. overshadowed disappointment after Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  said a bailout request is not imminent. Spanish
regional presidents met in  Madrid  yesterday after Economy
Minister Luis de Guindos said the nation is pressing on with its
analysis of whether to seek a bailout.  “You’ve got a lot of uncertainty at the moment,” said
Cameron Peacock, a Melbourne-based market analyst at IG Markets,
a provider of trading services for stocks, bonds and currencies.
“Will  Spain  request a bailout? You’ve got U.S. presidential
elections in five weeks and you’ve got a fiscal cliff looming at
the end of the year,” he said, referring to automatic tax
increases and spending cuts that may be triggered if deficit-
reduction efforts fail in the U.S.  Nippon Paper  Paper companies fell the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups today after the Nikkei newspaper reported Nippon Paper’s
operating profit will be about 12 billion yen ($153 million) in
the first half, compared with the company’s forecast for 15.5
billion yen. The shares lost 2.4 percent to 881 yen. Rival Rengo
Co. dropped 5.4 percent to 334 yen.  Uny plunged 11 percent to 541 yen, the lowest since at
least 1977, after the retailer forecast 39 billion yen in full-
year operating profit. The number compares with the median
estimate of 43.5 billion yen in a Bloomberg analyst survey.  Earnings season  starts this month with 138 companies on the
Topix set to report results on Oct. 26, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Daiichi Sankyo declined 5.4 percent to 1,191 yen after
halting the trial of a cancer medicine being developed with
ArQule Inc. ArQule plunged 56 percent to $2.18 in the U.S.
yesterday.  Among stocks that rose, Japan Petroleum Exploration climbed
5.3 percent to 3,380 yen after  Kyodo News  reported the nation’s
second-biggest oil and gas explorer succeeded in trial
extraction of shale oil in northern Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
