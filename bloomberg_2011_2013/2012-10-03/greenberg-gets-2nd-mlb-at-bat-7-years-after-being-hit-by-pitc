Adam Greenberg struck out in his
second Major League Baseball plate appearance, seven years after
his first at-bat ended with a fastball to the head.  Greenberg, 31, who signed a one-day contract with the  Miami
Marlins , was sent in last night to replace Bryan Petersen in the
bottom of the sixth inning by manager Ozzie Guillen. He went
down swinging when  New York  Mets pitcher R.A. Dickey delivered
three knuckleballs.  “What greater way to go about it than to face a Cy Young
candidate?” Greenberg said during a news conference before the
game at Marlins Park in Miami.  Greenberg was hit by the first pitch he faced as a Chicago
Cubs outfielder, a 92 mile-per-hour (148 kph) fastball thrown by
Marlins lefthander Valerio De Los Santos on July 9, 2005. The
concussion caused vision problems, headaches and vertigo for two
years, ending his major league career.  “Life throws you curve balls,” Greenberg told reporters
before the Marlins’ 4-3 win in 11 innings. “Mine threw me a
fastball at 92, and it hit me in the back of the head. I got up
from it and my life is great.”  Since the incident, Greenberg has played for  Israel  in the
qualifying round of the World Baseball Classic. He also was
married, started a health-supplement business and played in the
independent Atlantic League.  “Hopefully there is going to be a lot more of this,”
Greenberg said. “I want to show everyone I can play, although
you can never really truly do that in one at-bat, especially if
it ends up being against Dickey.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
