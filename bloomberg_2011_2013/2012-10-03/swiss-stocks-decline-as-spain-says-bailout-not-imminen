Stocks in Switzerland  declined as
Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said a bailout for the
country isn’t imminent and a report showed China’s services
industry expanded at the slowest rate in 19 months.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  led losses in the Swiss Market
Index, falling 1.3 percent. Cie. Financiere  Richemont (CFR)  SA dropped
1.2 percent.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  rose 1.5 percent for the biggest gain
on the index.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  led shares of
banks higher.  The benchmark  SMI (SMI)  fell 0.1 percent to 6,607.36 at 12:27
p.m. in Zurich, the first decline in three days. The gauge
dropped 1.7 percent last week amid concern that the U.S. Federal
Reserve’s latest round of bond buying will fail to encourage
economic growth. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
retreated 0.1 percent today.  “Equity markets are trading lower this morning on yet more
bad news out of China,” Markus Huber, head of German sales
trading at ETX Capital in London, wrote in e-mailed comments.
“Furthermore, comments made by Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy
after yesterday’s close that there are no plans for requesting
aid in the near future have proven to be a setback for those who
had hoped that uncertainty concerning  Spain  would finally be
coming to an end.”  Spain has no plans to ask for a bailout soon, Rajoy said
late yesterday, in response to mounting speculation that a
request was imminent.  China Economy  China’s non-manufacturing industries expanded at a pace
slower than any previous reading compiled by  Bloomberg News 
starting March 2011. The  purchasing managers’ index  fell to 53.7
in September from 56.3 in August, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
in Beijing. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  In the U.S., data at 10 a.m.  New York  time will probably
show  service industries  in the world’s largest economy grew in
September almost a similar pace to the prior month. The
 Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing index
slipped to to 53.4 from 53.7 in August, according to the median
estimate of 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The volume of shares in SMI-listed companies changing hands
was 19 percent lower than the 30-day average today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Julius Baer , the Swiss wealth manager established in 1890,
declined 1.3 percent to 32.99 Swiss francs.  Richemont, the maker of Chloe bags and Dunhill briefcases,
fell 1.2 percent to 57.95 francs.  Implenia AG (IMPN) , a Swiss builder, dropped 1.5 percent to 38.70
francs as Helvea SA downgraded the stock to accumulate from buy.  Holcim, the world’s second-largest cement maker, gained 1.9
percent to 62.50 francs, rising for a third day.  UBS and Credit Suisse each advanced 1 percent, to 11.89
francs and 20.99 francs respectively. A gauge of banks was the
third-best performer of 19  industry groups  in the Stoxx 600
Europe Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
