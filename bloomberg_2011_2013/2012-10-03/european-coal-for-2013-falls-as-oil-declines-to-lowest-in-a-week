European coal weakened as crude
dropped to the lowest level in a week.  Thermal coal for delivery next year to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp fell as much as 0.7 percent to $95.90 a metric ton,
the lowest since July 13, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contract was at $96.10 at 2:23 p.m.  London  time.  Brent oil for November settlement on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London dropped as much as $2.32, or 2.1 percent, to
$109.25 a barrel as U.S. crude stockpiles climbed for a fourth
week and a measure of  China â€™s economy declined, signaling fuel
demand may ease.  Bloomberg tracks information supplied by ICAP Plc, GFI
