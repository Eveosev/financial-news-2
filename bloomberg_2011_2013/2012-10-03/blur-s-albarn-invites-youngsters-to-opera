Damon Albarn -- Blur frontman and co-
creator of the popular “Dr. Dee” staged by English National
Opera in  London  earlier this year -- invited young audiences to
attend ENO’s new cut-price, dress-down events.  ENO is programming informal evenings with top seats priced
at 25 pounds ($40) and patrons encouraged to come as they are,
be it in jeans and running shoes. Bars will serve beer or themed
cocktails, and patrons will meet the cast at a post-show party.  Albarn said he got involved with ENO “to experiment and
learn.”  “I’m quite clearly not someone who had any formal opera
education,” he said at a press breakfast held on stage at the
Coliseum, where ENO is based. “The fact that ENO was prepared
to encourage that is a great sign of its health.”  Stage director Rufus Norris, co-creator of “Dr. Dee,”
said the word opera had “negative connotations to people who
don’t normally go,” and the goal was “taking away those
negative connotations.”  The first four special evenings are: “ Don Giovanni ” (Nov.
15); “La Traviata” (Feb. 7, 2013); “Sunken Garden” (April
18, 2013); and “The Perfect American” (June 13, 2013).  “Don Giovanni” is directed by Norris. “Sunken Garden”
is a world premiere with a libretto by David Mitchell, author of
“Cloud Atlas.” “The Perfect American” is a Philip Glass
opera getting its U.K. premiere.  For more information:  http://www.eno.org/undress .  Muse highlights include  Robert Heller  on rock,  Martin
