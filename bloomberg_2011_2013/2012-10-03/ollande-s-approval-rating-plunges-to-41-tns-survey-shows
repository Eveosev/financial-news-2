Support for French President  Francois Hollande  tumbled last month to a record low for a president six
months into his tenure, a TNS-Sofres poll for  Figaro Magazine 
showed today.  Hollande’s approval rating fell 9 percentage points to 41
percent in October, the survey showed. It was 55 percent in the
month after his May election.  Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault’s approval rating slid 10
points from last month to 41 percent, TNS-Sofres showed.  Paris-based TNS-Sofres interviewed 1,000 respondents, aged
18 and more, face-to-face between Sept. 28 and Oct. 1. The
pollster didn’t publish a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
