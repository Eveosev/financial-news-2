Early results from horizontal
drilling in the Utica shale formation in the U.S. Midwest have
been encouraging, Andrew Byrne, director of energy equity
research at  IHS Inc. (IHS) , said in a news release.  About two-thirds of the horizontal wells drilled in the
shale have reported initial production rates of more than 1,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day, he said. More than 135 drilling
permits have been granted for Utica horizontal wells, and 11
have been completed with test volumes, he said.  The Utica stretches across several states, including  Ohio ,
New York,  Pennsylvania  and West Virginia. It sits about 3,000 to
7,000 feet below the Marcellus shale and contains oil, wet gas
and dry natural gas.  Early research shows the vast majority of liquids in the
Utica are natural gas liquids rather than more valuable crude
oil, Byrne said.  “Much of the economic outlook for the play relies upon not
only natural gas prices, which remain low, but also prices for
natural gas liquids, which have been highly volatile,” Byrne
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
