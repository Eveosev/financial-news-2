South African soybeans fell for a
second day, tracking a decline in international prices as an
early U.S. harvest and improving weather conditions in South
America, the largest growing region, eased supply concerns.  Soybeans for delivery in December, the most active
contract, dropped for a second day, losing 1.2 percent to 5,325
rand ($632) a metric ton by the close on the South African
Futures Exchange. This is the lowest for a most active contract
since Sept. 28.  Soybeans fell as much as 1.7 percent to the lowest since
July 5 on the Chicago Board of Trade. Parts of  Brazil , northern
 Argentina  and Uruguay will have moderate to heavy rains this
week, maintaining soil moisture, Accuweather.com said in a
report yesterday. In the U.S., the largest grower last year,
about 41 percent of the crop was  harvested  as of Sept. 30,
compared with 15 percent a year earlier, the Department of
Agriculture said Oct. 1.  “People now think there will be more soybeans than
expected and that has pushed prices down,” Benjamin Swanepoel,
a trader at Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd., said by phone in
Johannesburg. “Rainfall in South America is also helping the
crop as yields are better than expected. There is less demand
for soybeans in America and this is also dropping prices
today,” Swanepoel said.  South African white-corn futures surged 1.9 percent to
2,474 rand a ton, the highest since Sept. 17. The yellow variety
rose 1.1 percent to 2,475 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
