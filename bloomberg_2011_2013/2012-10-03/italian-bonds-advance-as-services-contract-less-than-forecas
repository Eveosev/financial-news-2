Portugal ’s government securities
advanced, with 10-year bonds rising for a third day, amid
speculation that a bond-swap plan will pave the way for the
nation to return to long-term debt markets.  German 10-year bund yields were within three basis points
of the lowest level in four weeks as a report showed euro-area
services and manufacturing output dropped in September. Ten-year
 Italian yields  dropped to an eight-day low after Finance
Minister Vittorio Grilli told lawmakers the nation’s economic
recovery will start in the first months of 2013. Spanish two-
year notes declined after Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said
yesterday he has no plans to request a bailout soon.  “Sentiment has improved in the peripheral countries,”
said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “The debt swap
in Portugal is likely to be beneficial in generating optimism,
not just for Portugal but for other peripherals as well because
it puts them on the road back to the bond market.”  The yield on Portugal’s bonds maturing in October 2023
dropped 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 8.76
percent at 4:40 p.m. London time. The securities rose 0.93, or
9.30 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,291) face amount, to 73.705. The
nation’s two-year note yields declined 23 basis points to 4.86
percent.  Portugal Swap  Portugal’s debt agency exchanged securities due in
September 2013 for notes maturing in October 2015 as it tried to
reduce the nation’s near-term debt burden and regain access to
the capital market.  The Lisbon-based IGCP bought 3.76 billion euros of the 2013
securities at a yield of 3.1 percent in exchange for the same
face amount of the 2015 notes at a yield of 5.12 percent. Before
today’s bond exchange, the 2013 securities had 9.7 billion euros
outstanding.  Germany ’s  10-year yield  was one basis point lower at 1.45
percent, after falling to 1.42 percent on Sept. 28, the least
since Sept. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We see German bonds as overvalued unless the 10-year
yields get to 1.50 percent or above,” said Credit Agricole’s
Chatwell.  Euro-area  services and manufacturing output  dropped for an
eighth month in September. A composite index based on a survey
of purchasing managers in both industries fell to 46.1 from 46.3
in August, Markit Economics said. That’s above an initial
estimate of 45.9 published on Sept. 20. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  Retail Sales  German bonds pared gains after a report showed euro-area
retail sales unexpectedly increased for a fourth month in August
as demand rebounded in Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy.  Sales in the 17-member euro area rose 0.1 percent from
July, when they also gained a revised 0.1 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said. Economists had
forecast a decline of 0.1 percent, according to the median of 17
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. From a year earlier, sales
dropped 1.3 percent.  Italian 10-year yields rose two basis points to 5.05
percent, after reaching 4.97 percent, the lowest level since
Sept. 21.  “Only recently there have been signs of greater financial
stability that will lead, with inevitable delay, to a better
performance of our economy,” Grilli told the joint budget
committee of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.  Spain’s two-year yield added eight basis points to 3.22
percent, snapping two days of declines.  Spanish Sale  “There’s ongoing speculation about when Spain will ask for
a bailout,” said Gianluca Ziglio, an interest-rate strategist
at UBS AG in  London . “Even though Rajoy said they won’t do it
in the short-term, the market is pricing in that they will ask
for aid this month.”  Spanish notes declined before the government sells as much
as 4 billion euros of notes maturing in 2014, 2015, 2017
tomorrow.  German bunds have returned 3.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities earned 1.6 percent and Portuguese bonds made 44
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
