Syncrude strengthened after  Canadian
Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  said it would conduct 12 days of
maintenance on the Horizon upgrader this month and  Suncor Energy
Inc. (SU)  said September oil-sands output fell 20 percent.  Canadian Natural said maintenance previously planned for
the third quarter had been delayed and is scheduled to begin at
its 110,000 barrel-a-day Horizon upgrader on Oct. 11. Suncor
said oil-sands output averaged 300,000 barrels a day last month,
down from August because of planned maintenance.  Syncrude’s premium to West Texas Intermediate widened $1 to
$12 a barrel at 2 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg, the highest level for the grade since Sept. 19.  The discount for Western Canada Select, a heavy-oil blend
from  Alberta , narrowed $1.25 to $10.25 a barrel below the U.S.
benchmark. Bakken’s premium to the benchmark widened $3.50 a
barrel to $5.  U.S. Gulf Coast oils weakened. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s
premium to WTI decreased 70 cents to $19.80 a barrel. Light
Louisiana Sweet lost 45 cents to $18.80 over the U.S. benchmark.  Poseidon’s  premium  narrowed $2 to $11.25. Mars Blend’s lost
$1 to $12.50 a barrel over WTI and Southern Green Canyon
decreased $1.25 to $11.25.  The premium for Thunder Horse, a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
narrowed 50 cents to $17 above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
