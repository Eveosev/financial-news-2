Serbia banned all public gatherings
planned for Oct. 6, including the Gay Pride parade, as the
authorities seek to prevent any violence in Belgrade, the
Interior Ministry said.  The ban, the second in two years, was announced after 2,000
police officers guarded today’s conceptual art exhibition in the
capital Belgrade depicting Jesus Christ in a “provocative
context,” which caused great public disturbances, according to
an e-mailed statement citing Prime Minister Ivica Dacic, who is
also the Interior Minister.  Police banned the Gay Pride parade in 2011 citing threats
to public safety following reports that extremists were
preparing big riots in Belgrade. In 2010 more than 100 Serbian
policemen and civilians were injured and dozens more were
arrested in skirmishes that broke out at the Pride Parade, the
first public gay event in nine years.  The ministry is “not interfering, disputing or violating
anyone’s human and civil rights and freedoms” and the aim of
the ban is to “protect the security of the citizens of
Belgrade, prevent any conflicts or eventual unrests, which may
threaten diplomatic-consular offices of foreign countries,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
