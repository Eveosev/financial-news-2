Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  vice president Walid
Abu-Hadba is leaving the company and will be replaced by Steve Guggenheimer, who will head developer and platform evangelism, a
position tasked with winning over software developers.  Abu-Hadba, a 21-year Microsoft veteran, will stay for
several months to assist the transition after the release of the
software maker’s flagship operating system, Windows 8, later
this month, according to an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News.
The memo was written by S. Somasegar, who oversees the division
that works with software developers.  The e-mail’s authenticity was confirmed by Microsoft
spokesman Frank Shaw.  Guggenheimer in June decided to leave his position managing
the company’s relationships with computer makers and take a
sabbatical.  To contact the reporter on this story:
