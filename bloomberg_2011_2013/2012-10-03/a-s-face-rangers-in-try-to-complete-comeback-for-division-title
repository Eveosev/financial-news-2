The  Oakland Athletics  will attempt to
complete a 13-game comeback to claim  Major League Baseball ’s
American League West division title by defeating the  Texas
Rangers  in their last game of the regular season this afternoon.  The A’s defeated Texas 3-1 last night to tie the Rangers
atop the division with 93-68 records. It was Oakland’s fifth
straight win. The A’s were 13 games behind Texas on June 30.  The two teams will meet at 12:35 local time today at the
Oakland Coliseum. The winner is assured a spot in the best-of-
five-game AL division series, rather than a one-game wild-card
playoff game that matches the two teams with the best record who
didn’t win a division. The losing team will face either the  New
York Yankees  or  Baltimore Orioles  in a wild-card game on Oct. 5.  The Rangers are a slight favorite, according to oddsmakers,
with the -115 money line, meaning a winning $115 wager on Texas
would yield a $100 profit. Bettors would have to bet $105 to win
$100 on the Athletics.  Right-handed pitcher A.J. Griffin (7-1) will start for the
A’s against Texas right-hander Ryan Dempster (12-8). Griffin, a
rookie, is 3-0 at home this season; Dempster is 7-3 since being
acquired from the Chicago Cubs on July 31.  The A’s, who clinched their first postseason spot since
2006 two days ago, began the season next-to-last among the 30
Major League Baseball teams with a $55 million payroll, compared
with a $121 million payroll for Texas that ranks sixth highest,
according to USA Today’s annual survey.  In the AL East, the Yankees maintained their one-game lead
over Tampa Bay with a 12-inning, 4-3 win over the  Boston Red Sox 
last night.  Yankees-Orioles  The Yankees (94-67) and Orioles (93-68) have one game left
in the regular season.  New York  hosts Boston again tonight and
the Orioles play their finale at Tampa Bay. The teams, both
assured of making the postseason as wild cards even if they fail
to win the division, would meet in a one-game playoff tomorrow
in Baltimore to determine the AL East champion if they are tied
after today’s games. The Yankees’ Hiroki Kuroda (15-11) faces
Boston’s Daisuke Matsuzaka (1-6), while the Orioles’ Chris Tillman (9-2) will pitch against Tampa Bay’s Jeremy Hellickson
(9-11).  In the National League, the  Cincinnati Reds  and Washington
Nationals both won last night and remain tied for the best
record in baseball at 97-64. The Reds have clinched the NL
Central division title and the Nationals are winners of the NL
East.  Even though they lost 3-1 to the Reds, the St. Louis
Cardinals clinched the second NL wild-card spot when the  Los
Angeles Dodgers  lost 4-3 to the NL West champion  San Francisco 
Giants. The Atlanta Braves hold the other NL wild-card spot.  To contact the reporters on this story:
