Repsol Libya, a venture of Madrid-
based  Repsol SA (REP) , will provide DNA-testing equipment as a
contribution to social welfare in the North African country,
General Manager Felix Castañeda said.  The  oil company  signed a memorandum of understanding in
September with Libya’s Ministry for the Affairs of the
Families of the Martyrs and Missing Persons to build a
laboratory and train staff, he said in a news release. The
facility will be completed by September 2013, Castaneda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
