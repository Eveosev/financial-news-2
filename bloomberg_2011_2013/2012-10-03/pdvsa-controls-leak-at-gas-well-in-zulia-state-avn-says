Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state
oil company, controlled a leak at the P-192 gas well in western
Zulia state, government news agency AVN reported today on its
website.  PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is called, extinguished
a fire at the well at the PetroUrdaneta joint venture that left
four workers injured, AVN said, without providing additional
