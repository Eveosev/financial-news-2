The California Institute of
Technology in  Pasadena  retained its top spot in the Times Higher
Education World University  Rankings  for 2012-2013 as Harvard
University dropped to fourth.  Stanford University and the University of Oxford tied for
second place, the spot Harvard tied for last year. The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology was fifth as U.S.
institutions made up seven of the top 10, according to a
statement today from Times Higher Education, a magazine based in
 London . Oxford, seventh-ranked University of Cambridge and
eighth-ranked Imperial College London, all in the U.K., fill out
the top 10.  The rankings evaluated more than 700 universities on 13
criteria, including research income, staff-to-student ratio and
scholarly impact. U.S. universities make up 76 of the top 200
institutions in the rankings, followed by 31 from the U.K., 12
from the Netherlands and 11 from  Germany .  While there were fewer Asian universities in the rankings
than those from the U.S. or Europe, several showed gains.
 University of Tokyo  rose to 27 from 30, Tsinghua University in
China went to 52 from 71 and Seoul National University in  Korea 
advanced to 59 from 124.  “Huge investment in top research universities across Asia
is starting to pay off,” Phil Baty, editor of the rankings,
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
