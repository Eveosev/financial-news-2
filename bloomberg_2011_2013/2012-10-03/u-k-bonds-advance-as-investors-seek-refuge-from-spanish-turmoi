U.K. gilts advanced for a second day
as concern  Spain  would hold back from seeking a bailout boosted
demand for the perceived safety of Britain’s government bonds.  The 10-year yield fell to the lowest in more than three
weeks. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy yesterday said there
were no immediate plans to ask for a bailout, after Reuters
reported on Oct. 1 that Spain may seek aid as soon as this
weekend. The pound slid against the dollar as an index of U.K.
services rose at a slower pace than economists forecast in
September. The U.K. has been spared greater financial upheaval
by staying outside the euro area, a study by International
Monetary Fund economists said.  “Expectations about the next developments in Spain are the
driving force,” for gilts, said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in London. “News stories
that a bailout request could come as soon as this weekend being
quashed have contributed to a stronger tone.”  The yield on 10-year gilts dropped two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.69 percent at 2:02 p.m. London time,
after falling to 1.68 percent, the  lowest  since Sept. 10. The
1.75 percent security due in September 2022 rose 0.155, or 1.55
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,610) face amount, to 100.53. Two-year
rates were little changed at 0.19 percent.  Rajoy is weighing the terms of a Sept. 6 proposal by
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  to buy bonds of
cash-strapped nations including Spain if they make a formal aid
request from the euro region’s government-run rescue funds.  Services Data  Under normal times, joining the euro would lower trade
costs and help boost a country’s welfare in the long run,
according to the IMF study released yesterday in  Washington . In
a financial crisis that sent  interest rates  to levels recently
seen in the euro region, the effect would be negative, it said.  A  gauge  based on a survey of U.K. purchasing managers fell
to 52.2 last month from 53.7 in August, Markit Economics and the
 Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said today. The
median estimate of 29 economists in a  Bloomberg News  survey was
for a reading of 53. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  Bank of England  Markets Director  Paul Fisher  said last week
that third-quarter economic growth will be “very strong.”
That’s in part due to a rebound from the second quarter, when an
extra public holiday helped keep the economy mired in a
recession that started in the final three months of 2011.  U.K.  shop-price inflation  slowed in September, the  British
Retail Consortium  said today. Retail prices rose 1 percent from
a year earlier, compared with a 1.1 percent gain in August, the
trade group and Nielsen Co. said in a report.  Pound Declines  Gilts returned 3.3 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
3.2 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.4 percent.  The pound declined 0.2 percent to $1.6098, after touching
$1.6084, the lowest since Sept. 13. Sterling was little changed
at 80.16 pence per euro, after reaching 80.25 pence, the weakest
level since Sept. 20.  The pound has strengthened 0.6 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 0.3
percent and the dollar weakened 2.4 percent.  The Bank of England will leave its asset-purchase  target  at
375 billion pounds at its monthly policy meeting tomorrow,
according to all 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. It
will also leave its main interest rate at a record-low 0.5
percent, according to all 50 estimates in a separate survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
