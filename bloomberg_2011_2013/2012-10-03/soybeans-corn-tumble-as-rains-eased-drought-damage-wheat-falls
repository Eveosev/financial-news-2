Soybean prices rebounded from a
three-month low on speculation that demand will increase in the
U.S., the world’s second-biggest consumer. Wheat rose, and corn
declined.  Soybean futures tumbled as much 16 percent from a record on
Sept. 4. Last month, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  forecast
that domestic use in the year that began Sept. 1 will be 2.67
billion bushels, down from 3.105 billion estimated in  July  and
3.157 billion consumed a year earlier.  “Soybeans are back to  price levels  that the government
said would result in stronger demand,”  Richard Feltes , a vice
president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “Farmers have also quit selling crops
because of the price drop, which is tightening up cash
supplies.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.1 percent to
close at $15.3175 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $15.04, the lowest for a most-
active contract since July 5. The oilseed reached a record
$17.89 on Sept. 4 after a drought that the USDA said will cut
output to the lowest in nine years. China is the top consumer.  Wheat futures for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$8.73 a bushel in Chicago. The grain declined 3.4 percent in the
previous two sessions.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$7.5675 a bushel. The price jumped 5.9 percent the past three
sessions.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5
billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4
billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
