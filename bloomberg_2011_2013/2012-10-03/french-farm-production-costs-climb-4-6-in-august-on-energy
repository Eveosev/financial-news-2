French farm-production costs jumped
4.6 percent in August as growers and livestock breeders spent
more on energy and animal feed, the Agriculture Ministry said.  An index of agricultural-input costs averaged 135.1 for the
month, against 129.2 a year earlier, the ministry  reported  today
on its website.  Energy and lubricant expenses, making up about 11 percent
of the index, rose 8.9 percent, according to the report. The
cost of animal feed, with an index weighting of about 25
percent, climbed 8.5 percent.  “The costs of agricultural production climbed in July and
August, after stabilizing during the second quarter,” the
ministry said. “Those for energy continue their July rebound.”  The index for fertilizer, accounting for 12 percent of
farming costs, rose 3.3 percent and expenses for seeds and
planting material advanced 2 percent, the report showed.  Production costs for commodity crops, a subgroup of farming
expenses, gained 3.3 percent, while livestock and dairy
producers’ costs rose 4.6 percent, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
