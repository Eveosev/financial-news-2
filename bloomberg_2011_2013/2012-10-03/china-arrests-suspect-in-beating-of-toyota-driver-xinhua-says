Chinese police arrested a suspect in
the beating of a Toyota car owner during anti- Japan  protests
last month, the official Xinhua  News Agency  reported yesterday.  The protester in the northern city of Xi’An beat Li Jianli
with a U-shaped lock, leaving the driver unconscious for several
days, Xinhua said, without naming the suspect. The attack was
captured on video and distributed on the Internet, the news
agency said.  Protests broke out last month after Japan’s central
government said it will purchase a group of islands claimed by
both countries and administered by Japan.  Fishing and energy rights are at the center of the conflict
over the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkaku in Japanese
and the Diaoyu in Chinese. China and Japan have failed to
implement a June 2008 deal to develop a natural  gas field  in the
area and Japan has objected to Chinese drilling nearby.  To contact the reporter on this story:
