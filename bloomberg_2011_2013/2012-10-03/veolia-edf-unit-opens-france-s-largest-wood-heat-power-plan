A unit of  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) ,
the biggest water utility, and Electricite de France SA opened
the country’s largest heat and power biomass facility at a
production plant of papermaker  Smurfit Kappa Group Plc. (SKG)   The plant that will produce electricity and heat from wood
in the Aquitaine region of southwest France has a 69-megawatt
capacity. EDF will buy the power and Smurfit will use the steam
to dry paper, Paris-based Dalkia SAS said today in a  statement .  “This facility, which is of a rare size, has enabled us to
put in place a regional supply chain for wood energy and to
create 94 direct jobs: 24 jobs at the plant itself and 70 in the
supply chain,” Dalkia Chairman Franck Lacroix said.  France  seeks to double energy generation from biomass by
2020 and in March confirmed support for 15 large-scale biomass
projects that will total 420 megawatts and involve 1.4 billion
euros ($1.8 billion) in investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
