Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds held
at a record low on speculation inflation slowed in September and
investment in public works will buoy economic growth.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in July 2024 was little changed at 6.28 percent,
according to the central bank, remaining at the lowest closing
level since the debt was first sold in 2009.  “Investors have been getting out of the short end of the
curve and going into the long end as they see inflation
falling,” said Alejandro Reyes, the head analyst at
Ultrabursatiles brokerage in Bogota. “Given investment in
public works, the central bank might have been underestimating
growth and in that sense there is not much room to cut rates
further.”  Annual inflation slowed to 2.95 percent in September,
according to the median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before the Oct. 5 report. The central bank targets
inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent.  Banco de la Republica kept the overnight lending rate at
4.75 percent on Sept. 28, matching the forecast of 22 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Twelve had expected a 25 basis point cut.  Spending on public works rose 23 percent in the second
quarter from a year ago, according to government figures.
Colombia  announced  last month it would offer 30 highway tenders
worth 40 trillion pesos ($22 billion). More than 8,000
kilometers (4,971 miles) of highways will be built in six years,
according to the infrastructure agency.  Colombia’s economy grew 4.9 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier, according to a Sept. 20 report, beating the
forecasts of all 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 1,802.62 per  U.S. dollar ,
paring its rally this year to 7.5 percent, the fifth-best
performance among world currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
