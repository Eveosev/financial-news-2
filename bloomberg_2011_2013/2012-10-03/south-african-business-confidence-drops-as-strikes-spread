South African business confidence
dropped in September from a five-month high as strikes that
began at platinum mines spread to the  transportation industry .  The  business confidence index  fell to 91.7 from 95 in
August, the Johannesburg-based South African Chamber of Commerce
and Industry said in an e-mailed statement today. The index is
compiled from 13 economic indicators, including retail sales,
 inflation  and financial gauges, such as a stock-market index and
currency.  The index indicates “a depressed level for local
confidence,” Sacci said. “Recent developments in the domestic
labor market weighed heavily” on sentiment.  South African economic growth will probably slow this year
to 2.6 percent from 3.1 percent last year as demand for
manufactured exports from Europe wanes and strikes at gold and
platinum mines spread, Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus said on
Sept. 20. The  Reserve Bank  cut its benchmark  interest rate  for
the first time in 20 months in July, lowering it to 5 percent.  Manufacturing output, which accounts for 15 percent of the
economy, contracted 1 percent in the second quarter, and
probably continued shrinking in the third quarter, according to
the Kagiso Purchasing Managers’ Index.  Platinum companies may fire more than 8,000 workers after a
strike that started at  Lonmin Plc. (LMI) ’s Marikana mine in August
spread to other gold and platinum mines, SBG Securities Ltd.
