The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 3 basis points to 222
basis points as of 9:15 a.m. in Tokyo,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The gauge is on track for its lowest close since
Sept. 27, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 2 basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 156 as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney,
according to Westpac Banking. The measure is set for its lowest
close since Sept. 21, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 1 basis point to 133.5 as of
9:14 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The benchmark is also headed for its lowest close since
Sept. 21, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
