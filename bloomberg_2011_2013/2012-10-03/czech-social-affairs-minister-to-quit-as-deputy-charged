Czech Social Affairs Minister Jaromir
Drabek, who oversaw preparations of a pension-system overhaul,
said he’ll step down after police charged one of his deputies
with corruption.  Drabek, who’s also a deputy chairman of ruling-coalition
party TOP09, will leave his post at the end of the month, he
said at a news conference in  Prague  today broadcast on public
Czech Television. Drabek said he hasn’t done anything illegal.  Police this week charged one of Drabek’s deputies and
another ministry employee with bribery in connection with a
procurement tender, the CTK newswire reported. Drabek said he
believes his deputy will be proven innocent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
