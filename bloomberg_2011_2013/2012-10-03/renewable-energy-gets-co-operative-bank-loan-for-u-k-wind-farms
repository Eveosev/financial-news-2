Renewable Energy Generation Ltd. (WIND) , a
U.K.-based clean power developer, got a 16 million-pound ($26
million) loan from The Co-operative Bank Plc for two wind farms.  The 10-year loan was offered at a rate of 5.7 percent,
Jersey-based REG said today in a statement detailing completion
of project financing for its Sancton Hill and South Sharpley
wind parks.  REG will draw down 9.7 million pounds today and 6.3 million
pounds when the 6-megawatt South Sharpley plant in Durham,
northern  England , starts commercial operation at the end of the
year, according to the statement. The 10-megawatt Sancton Hill
facility in Yorkshire is already operational, according to the
 company’s website .  “The equity released will be reinvested in our next wave
of construction projects as REG continues to expand its
portfolio of renewable energy plant,” Chief Executive Officer
Andrew Whalley said in the statement.  REG, listed on  London ’s AIM market, operates 11 wind
projects in the U.K. with a total capacity of 51.15 megawatts
and is developing more than 1,000 megawatts, according to the
company.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
