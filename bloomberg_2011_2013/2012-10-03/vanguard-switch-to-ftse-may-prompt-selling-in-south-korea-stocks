Vanguard Group Inc.’s emerging
markets fund managers will need to sell shares of  South Korean (KOSPI) 
companies after the largest U.S. mutual-fund company replaced
 MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  with FTSE Group as the benchmark provider for six
equity funds.  The FTSE Emerging Index, which classifies  South Korea  as a
developed market, will replace the MSCI Emerging Markets Index
as the benchmark for the  Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index
Fund (VEIEX) , Vanguard said in a statement yesterday. Six Vanguard
international  index funds  with assets of $170 billion will
transition to benchmarks in the FTSE Global Equity Index Series,
according to the statement.  Money managers of so-called tracker funds can’t own shares
that are listed in a country not covered under its benchmark.
Vanguard’s emerging markets fund will need to sell positions in
South Korean stocks to comply with its classification, said
 Julie Andrews , a director in  Australia  for FTSE Group. The
change to FTSE benchmarks is the largest ever switch in
international index providers, according to an FTSE statement
yesterday.  “This change will have an impact on  asset allocation  for
these fund managers,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of
dynamic asset allocation at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
manages almost $100 billion. “If Korea becomes developed
status, then they’re going to have to get money out. But funds
that manage developed markets will need to buy.”  Low Cost  Vanguard, known for its low-cost index funds, manages about
$1.95 trillion in U.S. mutual fund assets. The change will
affect both index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds at
Vanguard, whose ETFs are structured as share classes of its
mutual funds.  The $58 billion  Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (VWO)  had 13
percent of its allocation in South Korea shares at the end of
June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ETF trades
throughout the day like stocks on U.S. exchanges and is designed
to mimic the MSCI benchmark index without trying to outperform
the gauge. Vanguard’s Developed Markets Index Fund is worth
$11.3 billion, more than 70 percent below the value of the
emerging markets ETF, according to  FTSE Group .  MSCI shares  slumped  the most on record yesterday, tumbling
27 percent to $26.21 in New York, after Vanguard said funds with
about $537 billion in assets will replace New York-based MSCI to
cut costs for fund shareholders. That’s the most since it went
public in November of 2007. In addition to the FTSE gauges,
Vanguard will also adopt benchmarks developed by the University
of Chicago’s Center for Research in Security Prices for 16 U.S.
equity and balanced funds.  Gradual Implementation  Vanguard will over time bring its emerging markets stocks
fund in line with the FTSE benchmark, Andrews at FTSE Group said
in an emailed response to questions today. “It is Vanguard that
is implementing the transition, and it is our understanding that
it will be managed gradually over time to minimize impact,” she
said.  FTSE Group said Vanguard will move the following U.S.
domiciled international funds to a FTSE benchmark: Vanguard
European Stock Index Fund, Vanguard Pacific Stock Index Fund,
Vanguard  Emerging Markets  Stock Index Fund, Vanguard Total
International Stock Index Fund, Vanguard Developed Markets Index
Fund, and the Vanguard Tax-Managed International Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
