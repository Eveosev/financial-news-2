Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662)  rose
the most in 18 months in Tokyo trading after  Kyodo News  reported
the nation’s second-biggest oil and gas explorer succeeded in
trial extraction of shale oil in the country.  Shares of the company, known as Japex,  rose  as much as 10
percent, the most since March 16, 2011, to 3,545 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stock fell back to 3,370 yen at the
trading break in Tokyo.  The company found a small amount of shale oil today at its
Ayukawa oil and gas field in northern Japan’s Akita prefecture
during trials that started on Oct. 1, said a Tokyo-based Japex
spokesman who asked not to be named in line with company policy.
Japex will continue the tests until early next year to develop
production technology for shale gas and oil.  The company estimates shale-oil reserves of 5 million
barrels at the field, according to the spokesman. This compares
with  Japan ’s average daily crude oil imports of 3.4 million
barrels in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
