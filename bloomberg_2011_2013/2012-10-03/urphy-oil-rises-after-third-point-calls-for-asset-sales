Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR)  rose to its highest
in six months after Third Point LLC, the $9 billion hedge fund
run by  Daniel Loeb , said the  oil company  should shed assets.  Murphy, based in El Dorado, Arkansas, gained 4.1 percent to
$58.21 at the close in New York, the highest price since March
19. The company was the best performer today among the 44
members of the Standard & Poor’s Energy Index.  Murphy would be worth as much as $94 a share after spinning
off its U.S. retail-fuel business and selling Canadian gas
fields, a U.K. oil refinery and its stake in an oil-sands
company, Third Point said in a third-quarter  investor letter 
posted on its website.  “Sentimental attachment by management and the Murphy
family is driving a stubborn desire to hold onto these and other
non-strategic assets,” according to the letter, which also
quoted from the Boyz II Men song “End of the Road.”  Barry Jeffery, a Murphy spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to a telephone message and e-mail seeking comment.  Third Point  said it holds a “significant stake” in Murphy
and has filed for permission to increase its position. The fund
currently has 1.5 million Murphy shares, or 0.8 percent of the
company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
