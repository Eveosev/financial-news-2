Taiwan’s government bonds rose,
pushing the 10-year yield to a two-month low, as investors
favored safer assets on more signs the global economy is
slowing. Currency forwards weakened.  The securities advanced for a third day as the Asian
Development Bank forecast today the region’s economies excluding
 Japan  will expand 6.1 percent this year, compared with a
projection of 6.6 percent in July. Taiwan’s consumer prices rose
2.77 percent in September from a year earlier, after reaching a
four-year high of 3.42 percent the previous month, according to
a Bloomberg survey before data due Oct. 5.  “Sentiment has been more pessimistic this week globally,
driving yields down,” said Albert Lee, a Taipei-based fixed-
income trader at Cathay United Bank Co. “Inflation should have
stabilized. It shouldn’t affect the bond market too much.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022
dropped two basis points to 1.135 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. That’s the lowest level for  benchmark 10-year
rates  since July 26.  The Reserve Bank of  Australia  unexpectedly cut its
benchmark rate yesterday, while data due today are forecast to
show euro-area retail sales fell for a second month in August.
Taiwan cut its 2012 economic growth forecast last month to 1.66
percent from 2.08 percent, after gross domestic product
decreased more than estimated in the second quarter.  One-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.2 percent to
NT$29.318, traded 0.3 percent stronger to the spot rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Taiwan dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.405 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It reached
NT$29.198 on Sept. 17, the strongest level since May 3. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, was little changed at 3.7 percent.  The  overnight money-market rate  was steady at 0.388
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
