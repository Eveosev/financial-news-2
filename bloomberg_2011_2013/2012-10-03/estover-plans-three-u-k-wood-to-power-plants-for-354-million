Estover Energy Ltd. plans to invest
220 million pounds ($354 million) to build three plants in
 Scotland  and  England  that generate heat and power from wood.  The U.K. renewable-power developer applied for planning
permission for the 52 megawatts of facilities, Max Aitken, a
director at Edinburgh-based Estover, said today by e-mail. It
 plans  to build two of the plants in Scotland and the other in
Northumberland, with construction starting in 2013 if approved.  Estover aims to raise debt to fund the projects, which will
use wood grown nearby to generate heat and power, Aitken said.
The company also plans a further three facilities, he said.  The U.K. expects 15 percent of its energy to come from
renewable sources by 2020 compared with 9.4 percent now. The
 government estimates  as much 30 percent of that may come from
biomass plants that use municipal waste, wood and straw.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
