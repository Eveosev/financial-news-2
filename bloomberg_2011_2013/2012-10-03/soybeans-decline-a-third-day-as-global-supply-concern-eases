Soybeans tumbled to the lowest in
almost three months as an early U.S. harvest and improving
weather conditions in  South America , the largest growing region,
eased supply concerns.  Brazil’s recent dry pattern may ease as storms may bring as
much as 1.25 inches (3.2 centimeters) of rain in the next five
days after 1.75 inches fell in the past 24 hours, Commodity
Weather Group said today in a report. In the U.S., 41 percent of
the crop was  harvested  as of Sept. 30, compared with 15 percent
a year earlier, the Department of Agriculture said Oct. 1.  “We’re seeing continued pressure coming through that
market,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth
Bank of Australia (CBA) , said from Sydney today. “The rapid pace of
the soybean harvest, the favorable planting conditions we’re
eying in South America and the negative influence of a very weak
palm-oil complex are weighing on global oilseed prices.”  Soybeans for November delivery fell 0.5 percent to $15.23 a
bushel by 7:13 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, after
touching $15.04, the lowest since July 5. Soybeans rose to a
record $17.89 last month as the worst drought in half a century
was set to cut U.S. output to the smallest in nine years.  Palm-oil futures in Malaysia yesterday slumped 8.5 percent
to 2,255 ringgit ($736) a metric ton, the lowest close since
November 2009, as stockpiles expanded in  Asia . Prices rebounded
4.3 percent today to 2,351 ringgit.  Corn for December delivery slipped 0.8 percent to $7.525 a
bushel. The price has dropped 11 percent since reaching a record
$8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10.  Corn Output  U.S. corn production may total 10.824 billion bushels and
soybean output may be 2.849 billion bushels, larger than the
USDA currently forecasts, INTL FCStone Inc. said yesterday. The
USDA is scheduled to update its projections Oct. 11.  Wheat for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to $8.655 a
bushel in Chicago. In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat was
little changed at 259 euros ($334) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Egypt is seeking at least 60,000 tons of milling wheat in a
tender today for delivery from Dec. 11 to Dec. 20.  France  is
“likely to provide the most competitive prices,” Arnaud
Saulais, a broker at Starsupply Commodity Brokers in Nyon,
 Switzerland , said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
