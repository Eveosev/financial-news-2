The Hungarian central bank’s rate
cuts will weigh on the forint in the coming year, with further
risks from delays in the government’s bailout talks, according
to Erste Group Bank AG.  The forint strengthened 0.1 percent to 285.77 by 12:04 p.m.
in Budapest, paring its decline since last week’s interest rate
cut to 1.1 percent, the worst performance after the South
African rand’s 2 percent slide among more than 20 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The yield on  Hungary ’s
10-year forint notes was unchanged at 7.38 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank reduced its benchmark two-week
deposit rate by 25 basis points on Sept. 25 to 6.5 percent,
still the highest in the European Union, to help Hungary emerge
from recession. Rate-setters, who also reduced borrowing costs
in August, voted to cut even as the central bank forecast
inflation at an average 5 percent next year, above the 3 percent
target and compared with an earlier projection of 3.5 percent.  “The path the central bank has chosen is risky and can
easily result in a weaker forint,” Orsolya Nyeste and Zoltan Arokszallasi, Budapest-based analysts at Erste, the third-
biggest western lender in eastern  Europe , wrote in a note today.
Erste changed its year-end projection for the forint to 292.5
per euro from an earlier 282.5, according to an e-mailed note.  Delays in Hungary’s negotiations for aid from the
International Monetary Fund and the European Union, which the
government requested almost 11 months ago, will also limit
advances by the country’s bonds, Erste analysts said. The 10-
year yield may be 7.4 percent at the end of the year, they said.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA’s CIB Bank unit, the most accurate
forecaster for the euro-forint rate in the six quarters to Sept.
30, changed its forecast for the end of 2012 to 285 from 283 and
for the first quarter of 2012 to 285 from 281, Sandor Jobbagy, a
Budapest-based analyst at the bank, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
