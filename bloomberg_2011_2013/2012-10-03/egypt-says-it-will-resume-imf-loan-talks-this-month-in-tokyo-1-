Egypt will resume discussions with
the  International Monetary Fund  on a $4.8 billion loan request
this month, and start a “social dialogue” on its economic
program tomorrow, Prime Minister Hisham Qandil said.  The talks will begin in  Tokyo  during the annual joint
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the  World Bank ,
and are expected to lay the foundations for a full resumption of
discussions on the loan, Planning and International Cooperation
Minister Ashraf El-Arabi said.  Qandil said Egypt will invite an IMF mission to visit the
country in the last week of October. The dialogue on the
economic plan will be held over three days and involve
representatives of various social and political groups, he told
reporters in Cairo.  Egypt ’s economy is struggling to rebound after last year’s
uprising and the political instability that followed. Tourism
and foreign investment have slumped, and the country has spent
more than half of its  currency reserves .  Egyptian officials are working on an economic plan to be
presented to the IMF. The two sides had been expected to meet
last month, until officials said the plan had yet to be written
and must first be submitted for public discussion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
