Canadian  stocks  fell as a slump in
Chinese non-manufacturing industrial growth offset better-than-
estimated reports on U.S. employment and services industries.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  retreated 2.1 percent
after Scotia  Capital Markets  cut its rating on the company amid
a weaker potash outlook. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and
 Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  slipped at least 2 percent. Crude fell below
$90 as a report showed U.S. crude output climbed to the highest
level in more than 15 years and fuel consumption decreased.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 31.76
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,359.47 in Toronto. The benchmark
equity gauge has advanced 0.3 percent this week.  “People have been hoping for and expecting a soft landing
in  China , but the most recent set of data suggests we may be
looking at a harder landing,” said Laura Wallace, vice
president and  fund manager  for Scotia Private Client Group, said
on the phone from Toronto. The group manages about C$10 billion
($10 billion). “We’re in a no-man’s land where the data isn’t
totally weak but isn’t totally strong either, except for  Europe 
which looks like they will be in recession.”  Stocks retreated across Europe and Asia as China’s  non-
manufacturing industries  expanded at the weakest pace since at
least March 2011. The purchasing managers’ index fell to 53.7 in
September from 56.3 in August. Readings above 50 indicate
expansion.  Jobs Data  ADP Employer Services said U.S. companies added 162,000
jobs last month, topping the median forecast of 38 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg for a 140,000 advance. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing index climbed to a six-
month high of 55.1, exceeding the most optimistic projection in
a Bloomberg survey, from 53.7 in August, figures from the Tempe,
Arizona-based group showed today.  Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)  fell 2.9 percent to C$30.28 and
Cenovus Energy slipped 2 percent to C$34.53. Crude for November
delivery tumbled 4.1 percent to $88.14 a barrel, the lowest
settlement since Aug. 2, after the U.S. Energy Department said
crude output rose 11,000 barrels a day to 6.52 million last
week, the most since December 1996. Total fuel demand fell 0.3
percent to 18.3 million barrels a day in the four weeks ended
Sept. 28, the lowest level since April.  Potash Corp., the world’s largest fertilizer producer,
slumped 2.1 percent to C$41.07 after Ben Isaacson, analyst with
Scotia Capital Markets, downgraded the stock to sector perform
from sector outperform.  Earnings Expectations  “The Street needs to bring numbers down substantially,”
Isaacson said in a note today arguing that earnings expectations
for the industry are too high.  Quebecor Inc. (QBR/B)  lost 1.3 percent to C$33 after agreeing to
pay C$1.5 billion to the Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec,
the country’s second-biggest pension fund manager, to increase
its controlling stake in a newspaper and cable television unit.
Quebecor will hold a 75.4 percent stake in Quebecor Media Inc.
after the transaction.  Pierre Karl Peladeau, chief executive officer of Quebecor,
said in a statement the company is “taking advantage” of a
favorable  debt market .  To contact the reporter on this story:
