A Ghana court ruled in favor of a
request by NML Capital Ltd. to block the departure of an
Argentine navy ship from the port of Tema, newspaper Clarin
reported, citing court papers.  The action is part of NML’s efforts to recover its
investment in Argentina’s defaulted bonds, the Buenos Aires-
based newspaper said today.  The South American government may be able to free the navy
training vessel Libertad by paying bail, Clarin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
