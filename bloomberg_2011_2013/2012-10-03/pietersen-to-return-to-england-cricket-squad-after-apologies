Kevin Pietersen, who was dropped by
 England ’s cricket team because of his criticism of teammates,
will be considered for the squad again after apologizing, the
England and Wales Cricket Board said today.  The batsman has apologized to Andrew Strauss, who retired
as captain after the incident, and said he regrets the effect on
the England team, the ECB said today in an e-mailed statement.  Pietersen, who grew up in South Africa, was left out of the
team after sending “provocative” text messages to friends on
the South African squad about Strauss during matches earlier
this year. He deleted the texts, but assured officials of their
nature, the ECB said.  “ECB is satisfied, following receipt of this binding
assurance, that to the best of his recollection, Kevin did not
convey any messages which were derogatory about the England
Captain, the England Team Director, the ECB or employees of the
ECB,” the ECB said in its statement. “Furthermore, there was
no tactical information whatsoever provided to members of the
South African Touring Party.”  England will travel to  India  later this month, where it
will play four Test matches and two Twenty20 internationals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
