European stocks  closed little changed
as U.S. reports on private hiring and services-industry growth
beat estimates, offsetting  Spain ’s stance that it won’t ask for
a sovereign bailout soon.  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , Europe’s second-biggest discount airline, rose
3.5 percent as full-year earnings beat its forecasts.  BTG Plc (BTG) 
gained the most in almost a year after increasing its financial-
year revenue forecast.  FirstGroup (FGP)  Plc plunged 21 percent after
Britain’s biggest train operator was stripped of the country’s
premier express route.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  slipped 0.1 percent to 271.37 at
the close in  London , after swinging between gains and losses at
least 12 times today. The gauge has rallied 16 percent from this
year’s low on June 4 as European Central Bank policy makers
agreed on an unlimited asset-purchase program and the  Federal
Reserve  announced a third round of quantitative easing.  “It’s a good sign when the market starts reacting to macro
data again,” said Anja Hochberg, head of investment strategy at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “The latest economic numbers
show that the economy is bottoming out. However -- and this
speaks for an even bigger upside potential of the markets -- the
economic hopes still need to show in real terms. The sentiment
is not yet exhausted. One more reason to invest in equities.”  National benchmark indexes fell in half of the 18 western
European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 retreated 0.2 percent,
the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.3 percent while Germany’s DAX rose
0.2 percent.  U.S. Employment  In the U.S., a report from ADP Employer Services showed
that private employers hired 162,000 workers in September after
revised numbers showed they signed up 189,000 the prior month.
Last month’s figure beat the average forecast for 140,000 in a
Bloomberg survey.  Labor Department figures on Oct. 5 may show the U.S.
 jobless rate  rose in September to 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent
in August, according to the median forecast of 82 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 115,000
last month, the report may also show.  Separate data today showed that U.S. service industries
expanded more than estimated in September. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s  non-manufacturing index , which covers almost
90 percent of the economy, rose to to 55.1 last month from 53.7
in August. That compares with the average economist forecast
that called for a drop to 53.4. A reading above 50 signals
expansion.  Spanish Rescue  In Europe, Spain has no plans to ask for a bailout soon,
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said yesterday, in response to
mounting speculation that a request was imminent.  Euro-area  retail sales  unexpectedly increased for a fourth
month in August as demand rebounded in Germany, Europe’s largest
economy.  Sales rose 0.1 percent from July, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said. Economists in a Bloomberg
survey had forecast a decline of 0.1 percent.  EasyJet rallied 3.5 percent to 615 pence, the highest price
since January 2008, after saying full-year earnings beat its
projections following a surge in demand for flights from London
after the end of the 2012  Olympic Games .  Pretax profit for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 will be in
the range of 310 million pounds ($500 million) to 320 million
pounds, EasyJet said today. That’s at least 25 percent higher
than a year earlier and compares with guidance given on July 25
for a figure no higher than 300 million pounds.  BTG, Sodexo  BTG advanced 9 percent to 363.2 pence, the biggest advance
since Oct. 5, 2011, after the drugmaker raised its revenue
forecast for the year to March 31, 2013 to between 205 million
pounds and 215 million pounds, , citing “a strong first-half
performance and a positive outlook for the second half.”  Sodexo (SW)  climbed 2.3 percent to 60.83 euros in Paris after
Credit Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation for the world’s
second-biggest provider of catering services to outperform, the
equivalent of buy, from neutral.  FirstGroup plunged a record 21 percent to 193.4 pence. The
U.K. Department for Transport canceled the West Coast
competition to run trains from London to  Scotland  citing the
discovery of “serious technical flaws” in the franchise
process. FirstGroup had won the route in August from billionaire
 Richard Branson ’s Virgin Group.  Vestas Slumps  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  fell 5.2 percent to 37.90 kroner
after the management of the world’s biggest wind-turbine maker
failed to convince investors at a capital markets day of its
plans to resurrect the company. Haakon Levy, an analyst with DNB
Markets, advised investors on Sept. 24 to hold onto the stock
because it might rise on the presentation.  The shares also fell after the company late yesterday said
a former chief financial officer was involved in two
unauthorized deals in India that may cost the company as much as
18 million euros ($23 million).  Lamprell Plc (LAM)  slumped 36 percent to 70 pence after saying
its 2012 loss will be wider than forecast and that it will
introduce changes to the senior management team.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  dropped 2.6 percent to 327.95 pence after the
U.K.’s largest retailer reported the first profit drop in almost
two decades after increasing investment to halt declining
supermarket sales.  So-called trading profit fell 11 percent to 1.59 billion
pounds ($2.6 billion) in the first half of the financial year,
also hurt by reduced earnings in  South Korea  and central Europe,
Cheshunt, England-based Tesco said today. The average estimate
of 12 analysts compiled by Bloomberg was 1.62 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
