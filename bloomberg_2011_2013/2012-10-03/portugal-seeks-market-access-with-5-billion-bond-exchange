Portuguese debt agency IGCP exchanged
bonds maturing next year for securities due in 2015, reducing
its 2013 repayment burden as it tries to regain access to long-
term debt markets.  The agency bought 3.76 billion euros ($4.86 billion) of
bonds due in September 2013 with a yield to maturity of 3.1
percent in exchange for the same value of securities maturing in
October 2015 with a yield to maturity of 5.12 percent, the
Lisbon-based IGCP said today. Before today’s bond exchange, the
notes due in 2013 had 9.6 billion euros outstanding.  “The result was quite satisfactory because it indicates
there is interest from investors to extend their exposure to
Portuguese debt,” said Filipe Silva, who manages 60 million
euros of securities at Banco Carregosa SA in Oporto, northern
 Portugal . “If we see this exchange as a market test, I’d say
that Portugal passed.”  Portugal has to meet the September 2013 bond redemption
without relying on a European Union-led rescue program, which
extends until the middle of 2014. While Portugal has continued
selling bills, it hasn’t sold bonds since requesting the bailout
in April 2011.  The yield on the September 2013 note fell 41 basis points,
or 0.41 percentage point, to 3.20 percent at 11:34 a.m. London
time, while the rate on the October 2015 bond fell 14 basis
points to 5.23 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lower Yields  “This marks a first step for Portugal to regain access to
medium and long-term debt markets,” Joao Moreira Rato, chairman
of the debt agency, said in an e-mail after today’s bond
exchange. “This transaction allows the extension of debt stock
maturity, taking advantage of the continuous improvement in
secondary market conditions.”  Yields have dropped at auctions and in the secondary market
as the government cuts spending and raises taxes to comply with
the terms of the 78 billion-euro aid plan from the EU and the
 International Monetary Fund . Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho 
has said that if the country can’t tap bond markets by September
2013 because of “external reasons,” it would be able to count
on continued support from the IMF and the EU.  Borrowing costs dropped to the lowest since 2010 at a Sept.
19 sale of 1.29 billion euros of 18-month bills, while the
difference in yield that investors demand to hold Portugal’s 10-
year bonds instead of German bunds has narrowed to 7.4
percentage points from 16 points on Jan. 31.  Junk Rating  In January,  Standard & Poor’s  followed  Fitch Ratings  and
Moody’s Investors Service in cutting Portugal’s credit rating to
non-investment grade, or junk.  Portuguese debt has this year returned 44 percent,
including reinvested interest, the most of 26 markets tracked by
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Irish debt, the second-best
performer in the euro region, has handed investors 25 percent,
while German bund gains are 3.2 percent in 2012.  Ireland, which has also received a bailout, in July
returned to long-term debt markets for the first time in almost
two years by selling 4.19 billion euros of new bonds, while also
exchanging some short-maturity notes for longer-term debt.  European Central Bank  President  Mario Draghi  on Sept. 6
said bond purchases may be considered for euro-area countries
currently under bailout programs, such as Greece, Portugal and
Ireland, when they regain bond- market access .  Access Sought  The Portuguese government plans to carry out debt market
operations as it aims to regain access to bond markets by
September 2013, Maria Luis  Albuquerque , the secretary of state
for treasury and finance, said on Sept. 11.  Portugal is “sounding out” the market as it prepares to
resume sales of medium-term notes, Moreira Rato said in an
interview in July. Portugal plans to issue medium-term notes
with maturities of one to five years that are designed for
specific creditors, the IMF said on July 17.  Portugal’s  debt , which will peak below 124 percent of gross
domestic product, “remains sustainable and will be on a firm
downward trajectory after 2014,” the IMF, the European
Commission and the European Central Bank said in a joint
statement on Sept. 11. The IMF in July said Portugal’s debt
would peak at about 118.5 percent of GDP in 2013.  The country has been given more time to narrow its budget
shortfall after  tax revenue  missed forecasts and the economy
heads for a third year of contraction in 2013. Portugal aims to
reach a deficit of 5 percent in 2012 instead of the previous
goal of 4.5 percent, Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said on Sept.
11 after EU and IMF officials agreed on the new targets.  The government projects GDP will shrink 1 percent in 2013
after a contraction of 3 percent this year. Economic growth has
averaged less than 1 percent a year for the past decade, placing
Portugal among  Europe ’s weakest performers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
