Natural gas futures in New York
dropped the most in seven weeks on forecasts of moderating
temperatures that may limit demand from  power plants .  Gas slid 3.9 percent. The weather may be mostly normal in
the eastern half of the U.S. from Oct. 13 to Oct. 17, compared
with earlier forecasts for below-normal temperatures, according
to Commodity Weather Group LLC. Gas had jumped 17 percent since
Sept. 26 on speculation that the cold would boost demand. A
supply  surplus  has dropped to 8.6 percent from 61 percent in
March while shale-gas output sends production toward a record.  “Traders are looking at the forecasts,” said Bob Yawger,
director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
in New York. “We’ve run out of momentum after trying to stay
above $3.50. A pullback is justified here.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 13.6 cents to settle
at $3.395 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 6.1 percent from
a year ago. Today’s slide was the biggest percentage drop since
Aug. 10. Gas rose to $3.531 per million British thermal units
yesterday, the highest settlement price since Dec. 2.  The commodity’s 14-day relative strength index climbed to
74.5 yesterday, the highest since March 2008, as prices jumped.
Some traders see a reading of 70 or above as an indication that
gains aren’t sustainable.  November $3 puts, bets that prices will fall, were the most
active gas options in electronic trading. They rose 0.9 cent to
2.5 cents on volume of 1,261 contracts as of 3:07 p.m. Puts
accounted for 52 percent of options volume.  Weather Outlook  The high in  Washington  on Oct. 16 may be 69 degrees
Fahrenheit (21 Celsius), 1 above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in
 Boston  may be 59 degrees, 2 less than the usual reading.  Electricity producers account for about 36 percent of U.S.
gas consumption, according to the Energy Department.  The U.S. winter may be the second in a row to produce low
energy demand for heating even while falling short of the record
high temperatures of the 2011-2012 season, MDA EarthSat Weather
predicted in an outlook yesterday.  The winter, measured by meteorologists as running from
December through February, will probably have temperatures above
the 10- and 30-year normal ranges, according to  MDA  in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The result may be less natural gas,
heating oil and electricity needed to warm homes and businesses,
MDA said.  Stockpile Report  “Futures are coming under some selling pressure, with
traders taking profits off the recent rally after  weather
forecasts  turned warmer again, undercutting early heating season
demand,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York, in a note to clients today.  Government data scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m.
tomorrow in Washington may show inventories climbed by 73
billion cubic feet last week to 3.649 trillion, according to the
median of 18 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five-
year average change is an increase of 78 billion.  Gas stockpiles may reach an all-time high of 3.95 trillion
cubic feet by the end of October, the Energy Department said
Sept. 11 in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  The U.S. increased its estimate for natural gas production
in 2012 by 0.2 percent and lowered its outlook for prices, the
outlook showed. Marketed gas output will average 68.86 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up from 68.72 billion estimated in
August, the report said. Output may rise 4 percent from last
year’s record 66.22 billion.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $2.65 per million British thermal units, below the
previous forecast of $2.67, the data showed.  Energy Independence  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first six months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
345,927 as of 2:41 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 378,000. Volume was 486,335 yesterday. Open interest was 1.15
million contracts. The three-month average is 1.11 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
