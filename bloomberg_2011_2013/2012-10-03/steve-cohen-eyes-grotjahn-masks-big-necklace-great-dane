The opening of Mark Grotjahn’s latest
show attracted collectors such as hedge-fund manager  Steve Cohen 
and Donald B. Marron of Lightyear Capital LLC.  What they saw at  Gagosian Gallery ’s Madison Avenue
headquarters resembles cardboard boxes, crudely cut up and
splattered with paint to look like masks with protruding,
Pinocchio-like noses.  The low-end appearance is deceiving. Displayed on
pedestals, the pieces are actually cast in bronze. The daubs
turn them into a hybrid of sculpture and painting, a direction
the Los Angeles-based artist explored in his 2011 “Face”
series.  Some of those semi-abstract paintings were so densely
layered with oil paint, the viscous material actually projected
about an inch off the canvas.  Humorous and just a tad menacing, the bronzes remain true
to the rough physicality of the original cardboards, down to the
smallest dents, tears and creases.  The works are unique. Prices range from about $100,000 to
$250,000. “Mark Grotjahn” runs through Oct. 27 at 980 Madison
Ave.; +1-212-744-2313;  http://www.gagosian.com/ .  Great Dane  Before leaving the building, stop by the third floor, where
gallerist and writer Adam Lindemann operates Venus Over Manhattan.  The gallery’s current exhibition, by  New York  conceptual
artist Peter Coffin, includes drawing, video and an aluminum
rack filled with rolls of colorful ribbons.  Prepare to be startled. The stark space -- empty of other
visitors or even a gallerina during a recent visit -- is
dominated by a giant replica of a black Great Dane, reclining
but alert, with head up and ears pricked. The Hound of the
Baskervilles has nothing on this creature.  Almost 7 feet tall and 15.6 feet long, the work is an
obvious artifact. Oddly, that doesn’t make it less intimidating.
It looks ready to pounce, making the visitor feel like an
intruder.  Prices range from $15,000 to $200,000. “Peter Coffin A, E,
I, O, U” runs through Nov. 2 at 980 Madison Ave.; +1-212-980-
0700;  http://venusovermanhattan.com/ .  Big Beads  A huge silver-and-black beaded necklace hangs from the
ceiling of  Manhattan ’s L&M Arts, descending 50 feet through the
gallery’s five floors and spiraling staircase before ending in
the lobby.  “Gigantic Necklace” by Jean-Michel Othoniel is on view
alongside eight other works by the French contemporary artist
and costs $400,000.  The same way Othoniel transformed Place Colette in Paris
with the installation of his “Kiosque des Noctambules,” a
pavilion with vaults made of beads and pearls, he has now turned
Dominique Levy and Robert Mnuchin’s classical art space into
something that evokes a giant’s toy land.  “Untitled (Grey Knot)” and “Untitled (Black Knot),”
both glass-bead necklaces curved into knots, float in the air
next to “Untitled (Blue Knot)” and “Untitled (Black and
Purple Knot),” resting on flat silver pedestals.  With its vertical figure, “Garland Necklace,” made of
silver and purple beads, looks like a fairy skateboard ramp.  Prices range from $37,500 to $400,000. “Othoniel” runs
through Oct. 6 at 45 E. 78th St.; +1-212-861-0020;

1950s paintings and sculptures by Alexander Liberman (1912-
1999), a Russian emigre who became an influential Vogue art
director.  As an artist, Liberman developed a hard-edged, geometric
style. He experimented with materials such as industrial enamel
and stainless steel, placing lollypop-sized disk sculptures on
tiny marble pedestals.  His paintings feature circles, fluid lines and combinations
of red, white, yellow, blue and black. They allude to Malevich,
point to minimalism and create a link to contemporary artists
Ellsworth Kelly and Brice Marden.  Prices range from $30,000 to $150,000. “After Image:
Paintings and Sculpture from the 1950s” runs through Oct. 26 at
1018 Madison Ave.; +1-212-744-7400;  http://www.miandn.com/ .  Gutai Group  In the postwar atmosphere of ruin and desolation, a group
of about 20 Japanese artists led by Jiro Yoshihara turned away
from the past and formed the Gutai Art Association in 1954 to
“Engage in the Newness!” as one of its slogans said.  Freedom, improvisation and new materials were some of the
defining characteristics of the group’s work.  Today, in the same townhouse that held Gutai’s first U.S.
exhibition more than 50 years ago, Hauser & Wirth presents more
than 30 works by 12 of its members.  Two circles from Yoshihara’s celebrated series, one black
on white and another blue on red, are on view with Kazuo
Shiraga’s beautiful 1965 “Red Fan,” an imposing sculpture in
lacquered tissue paper and wood.  Shiraga’s oil-on-canvas “Green Fan,” made with strong
circling brushstrokes, gives a sense of spin and movement. “I
want to paint as though rushing around a battlefield,” the
artist wrote.  Most of the works are not for sale; prices for available
pieces range from $50,000 to about $1.5 million. “A Visual
Essay on Gutai at 32 East 69th Street” runs through Oct. 27;
